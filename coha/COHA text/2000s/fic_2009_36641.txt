And so it had come to this . <p> It was the night when Rabbi Ahava 's shofar echoed in the Valley of Mak'ob , summoning the lepers of Israel . All that remained of the child 's life could be counted in a thousand heartbeats . She was the smallest of all the lepers in the Valley of Sorrows . Born in a cave to a diseased mother four years before , she began her life with the certainty of death on her horizon . Her mother died giving her life . <p> Rabbi Ahava named the baby girl Ya'el but called her Yod , after the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet . " Yod , " he said to the children in his Torah school , " is the most important letter , after all . <p> " The letter yod hangs above the other letters like a little bird . Yod begins the word Israel ... Yis-ra-el . " The old man held up a gnarled forefinger to inscribe the yod upon the air in a single crooked dash . " So Israel begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deuteronomy , The Lord did not set His love upon you and choose you because you were more in number than any other people , for you were the least of all the people . " <p> Rabbi Ahava taught them , " Israel begins with the smallest stroke , yod . Israel ends with the largest letter , lamed . This proves that the Almighty , blessed be he , loves all of Israel from the smallest to largest . From the youngest to the eldest . And everyone in between . " <p> Yod was a good name for the child . She had never known any world but the leper colony , so she was happy even in the midst of suffering . Little Yod was indeed the smallest citizen of the Valley of Sorrow . She was nursed by three women who had lost their children to the disease . Yod thrived on the milk of her surrogate mothers , though she was a tiny infant when the spot of leprosy appeared on her right hand . <p> Each of her mothers perished before her third birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the youngest , were her mothers and her fathers and her brothers and sisters . <p> She loved the kind young man named Cantor and his wife , Lily , most of all . Perhaps she imagined that they were her true father and mother and that they could live a long and happy life as a family . Cantor praised her spirit . Fearless . Quick to learn . Yod fed Cantor 's hawk and was not afraid even when children twice her age cowered in fear of the fierce raptor . If I am a brave girl , Cantor will want me to be his daughter , she thought . <p> But it was not to be . <p> Cantor , handsome and kind , became sick one night and died suddenly . When he was buried , Yod hung back from all the other children who had loved him . She wept the tearless grieving of a leper ... and became blind . <p> The death of Cantor shattered all hope in the Valley but one . <p> A baby boy was born to Lily 's friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beginning with yod and ending with lamed , his life somehow represented all the dreams of the lepers of Mak'ob . From the smallest to the largest , it was decided that the baby boy must not remain in the Valley , where he would surely sicken and die . So Cantor 's grieving widow , Lily , had carried the newborn up the steep path to the Outside in order to save him . <p> When Lily had topped the rim of the Valley and turned to look at those who remained , Yod began to weaken . Only days passed before Yod was carried to the Dying Cave . There she remained until , at last , only one thousand heartbeats remained before the end of her life . <p> It is told that the last sense to leave before death is the sense of hearing . <p> Yod did not know how long she had been in the Dying Cave . She could not see . She had no sense of touch or taste . She could not speak . <p> 1,000 heartbeats ... <p> Yod heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her there was stirring . Voices . A whisper of excitement . <p> " Lily 's back ! " <p> " The Great Healer ! " <p> " The One we have been waiting for ! " <p> " He 's coming ! " <p> " The Light ! " <p> " The Prophet ? Help me . Oh , help me ! " <p> " Someone get me my stick . " <p> " Yes ! Messiah ! Healer of Lepers ! " <p> " Let me help you . He is here ! On the stone of the bema . Teaching ! Healing ! " <p> " He has come to heal us all ! " <p> " Hurry ! Please ! " <p> Yod heard the shuffling of feet near where she lay . Did they not see her ? <p> There was a rustle of tattered blankets as those who shared the darkness with her moved toward the light . Had they forgotten her ? <p> Yod tried to speak . Tried to ask for help . She could not move her hands . Her mouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not form even one word . <p> There was silence in the Dying Cave . <p> 818 heartbeats remained . <p> Then a single voice called , " Anyone else ? Anyone still here ? " <p> Yod 's thoughts raced . She could not form the words , Me too ! Though I 'm the least ! Do n't forget me ! <p> The sounds of faraway excitement filtered in . <p> But Yod was alone . Forgotten . Left behind in the darkness . <p> 749 heartbeats ... <p> Outside the bonfire blazed . Torches streamed toward the source of light like molten metal about to be remade . <p> 670 heartbeats ... <p> " Me first ! " <p> " Please , Lord ! " <p> " Heal me first ! " <p> But Yeshua of Nazareth commanded that the children of Mak'ob be brought to Him before any others . <p> 612 heartbeats ... <p> Rabbi Ahava identified each faceless boy and girl by name and guided them toward the arms of the Great Healer . All were thin and gaunt . Some were blind , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were unrecognizable as human . Their faces were a mass of sores and rotting flesh . They were atrophied specters of what boys and girls should have been . Those who gathered round Yeshua were from ages twelve to six . <p> 572 heartbeats ... <p> Yeshua saw them all . He saw them each . One by one He passed down the line of thirty-two , from the tallest boy to the smallest ... and He healed them all . <p> " Tell no man , " He said to Ahava . " These children are in danger . You must take them all to the synagogue of your brother . " Then He asked , " But is this every one of us ? All the lepers of Israel ? " <p> The old rabbi frowned and scanned the ranks . " Everyone ? " <p> Yeshua questioned him . " One little lamb is missing . Counting from the smallest to the largest . Yod to lamed . All of Israel . " <p> 400 ... 399 ... 398 ... <p> Ahava 's eyes widened . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you see . Yod is her name ... you know . But where is she ? " The old rabbi peered into each face , behind each boy and girl . " Where is your sister ? " <p> 336 heartbeats ... <p> " In the Dying Cave , " Lamed , Yod 's oldest brother , replied sadly . <p> Ahava stretched his hands out to the congregation . " Our little one ! Our youngest child ! She was in the Dying Cave . Did anyone carry Yod here ? " <p> No one answered . A moan rose up from the congregation . Had the littlest in Israel perished just before the moment of deliverance ? Had they left this one precious soul behind ? <p> 212 heartbeats ... <p> Yeshua tucked His chin . Snatching a burning brand from the fire , He strode alone toward the face of the cliff . He ducked and entered the low limestone entrance of the Dying Cave . <p> " Yod , " He cried as her pulse raced toward the end . <p> All the people of Mak'ob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell on every rag and mound of blankets in His search for the child . <p> 100 ... 99 ... 98 ... 97 ... <p> The Great Shepherd cried , " Yod ! It 's Yeshua ! I have been looking for you , little one ! Searching ... " <p> The light paused , illuminating the smoke-scarred stone of this last refuge . Yeshua planted the torch in the ground and stooped beside the tiny body . He drew back the tattered rag that covered her . <p> Ahava whispered , " Does she still survive ? " <p> 77 ... 76 ... 75 ... <p> Yeshua gathered Yod into His arms and held her close . <p> 35 ... 34 ... 33 ... <p> He kissed her bloody cheek and stroked her hair . Tiny stubs that had been feet protruded from His arms . Moments passed as He held her . <p> 16 ... 15 ... 14 ... <p> The flame of the torch flickered in a sudden wind , then was extinguished . <p> 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... <p> The smallest of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... floating like a little bird above the others .... <p> * * * <p> Three days had passed since Yeshua of Nazareth had gone down into the Valley of Mak'ob to heal the lepers . Of all the 612 afflicted , only Lily and Cantor , healed and whole and waiting , remained now , watching , on the rim high above the valley floor . <p> The hawk spread his wings and swung in a lazy circle over the place of separation . There was only one man left below of all who had entered that exile of loneliness : His common name was Yeshua , which means " God is Salvation . " The prophets who foretold His coming to this valley of suffering called Him the Great Leper . They wrote what the God of Israel had commanded them concerning Messiah : A Man of Sorrows . Acquainted with Grief . <p> But other words of prophecy had come true for the people of the Valley of Mak'ob : By His wounds we are healed . <p> From the top of the precipice Lily and Cantor gazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Israel had tended gardens and lived until they died . <p> The Valley of Israel 's Sorrow was vacant . Smokeless , blackened pits punctuated the spaces where only one day before , men and women without hands or feet or faces had spent all their energy keeping the watch fires lit . <p> Lily stared at the mounds of the cemetery . She fixed her gaze on the open grave where Cantor had lain . She said , " What was here ... and who we were before he came ... it will be forgotten , I suppose . " <p> Cantor nodded , testing his voice . " When the time is right , he will call them each by name , like he called me . And they will also hear and come forth healed from their graves . Better than healed . They will walk up the steep path to where we stand now . " He stretched his hand up to Hawk in a signal that it was time to go . " Or maybe on that day we will all know how to fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me ... everything ? " <p> Cantor nodded . His eyes reflected light from a distant place . " There is no death there . " <p> " And where he is sending us now ? The land where Eden once existed ? The land he said is waiting to hear our story-that the Redeemer of Eden has come back ? " <p> Cantor frowned for the first time since he awakened from the long sleep . " It was perfect once . I saw it as it was ... before . There was no death until there was a murder of brother by brother . " <p> Lily asked , " What was it like ? " <p> " Too much to tell . Beyond beauty ... beyond fear . Lily , I will never be afraid again . They are all there , waiting for us , and waiting for him to return home . " Cantor inclined his head toward Yeshua . <p> Yeshua sat alone on the broad flat stone where Rabbi Ahava had led the minyan of ten lepers in prayers each morning . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayed alone . <p> Lily wondered aloud , " Cantor , do you think Yeshua will stay here ? Do you think since he has healed us all and has taken our disease upon himself ... do you think he will remain in the Valley ? Will he suffer here in the place of those of us who are free ? " <p> Cantor answered , " There are too many lost living in Israel for him to stay here for long . It is written : He sent forth His Word and healed them ; He rescued them from the grave . And so he still has work to do . It must be fulfilled while he is on earth . " <p> Cantor looked up at the hawk he had trained to hunt-so very long ago it seemed . The arc of the bird 's flight grew ever higher , almost to the top of the cliff . <p> The bird was rising on the prayers of the Messiah , Lily thought . Flying upward with a single purpose : to do the will of the Master . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shrill cry tore the fabric of the sky . <p> Yeshua lifted His face , ravaged by the sickness of others . He held up leprous hands in farewell to Hawk . And then He waved to the silent observers who perched on the rim of His suffering . <p> Cantor cupped perfect fingers around his mouth and shouted down , " Shalom ! Yeshua ! HaMashiach ! " <p> The stones of the surrounding hills echoed in antiphonal song : <p> " Yeshua ! " <p> " Mashiyah ! " <p> " Shalom ! " <p> " Shalom ! " <p> " Yeshua ! " <p> " Shalom ! " <p> And there followed on the breeze a scattering of voices , living stones , who watched over the Great Leper from secret places in the cliffs . <p> " Give thanks ... " <p> " To the Lord ! " <p> " For He is Good ! " <p> " His Love endures forever ! " <p> " Forever ... forever ... forever ... " <p> Lily whispered , " Though the place is empty except for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> When the last echoes died away , Lily and Cantor turned from the Valley of Mak'ob and left that place . Hawk came along , flying from stone to stone , alternately following and preceding the newly created couple as they walked toward the place where Eden had been , to the far country where Yeshua had commanded they must go . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
