<p> GOOD NEIGHBORS Train station manager gave first-class service <p> I am very belatedly writing this letter of praise for the assistance rendered by Marsha Wood , the former MARTA station manager at the Georgia Dome station . <p> My family was traveling to the Georgia Dome . In the rush to get off the train at the Dome station , I inadvertently dropped my prescription glasses ( in a case ) from my jacket pocket . I noticed the glasses were missing as the train was leaving and rushed to an employee who was monitoring the entry gates . He referred me to a woman whom I later learned was Wood . She was immediately trying to solve the problem . There was no hesitation . She asked me for a description of the glasses and called ahead to the next stations . <p> Although she was not able to reach anyone at the upstream stations , she did not give up . She had us wait for the train to come back to us . Four of us , including Wood , went on the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to me . <p> I would not have found my glasses without Wood . She went above and beyond anything I would have expected . She only let me say thanks and then was gone about her duties . Another MARTA employee gave me Wood 's name . <p> There are probably many others she has also helped without recognition . ED PALMER JR. , Athens <p> Bidder 's gift of road race T-shirt thrilled 12-year-old <p> I took my daughter to the Peachtree Road Race Expo on July 3 to get a preview of the race . She is 12 and was not running , but my sister and I were running our 13th race . <p> We walked in just as the auction for the T-shirts that were finalists for the selection was getting started . My daughter wanted to get in on the bidding , but I told her we could n't bid any higher than $25 . <p> Although we bid on all five shirts , the bidding went much higher than our $25 , so we left empty-handed . <p> As we were walking into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shirt he had won bidding against us . I offered to pay him , but he said the shirt would look better on my daughter than him and it was a gift . <p> Unfortunately , I did not get his name to thank him , but I would like him to know that my daughter was thrilled with her " Peachtree " shirt . <p> That was such a kind act of generosity . JUNE CORDELL , Roswell <p> Man who returned credit-card holder is a gem <p> The world is a better place because of an honest young man named Brice Shew who found and returned my credit-card holder and its contents at the Sam 's Club on Clairmont Road recently . <p> Thanks so very , very much , Brice . I am forever grateful to you .

Box 4689 , Atlanta , GA 30302 . <p> CLARENCE THOMAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent series of articles about Justice Clarence Thomas truly inspiring . The fact remains , however , that he and his four fellow conspirators on the court illegally gave the election to President Bush . <p> Conservative commentators screamed loudly during the recent impeachment hearings about the rule of law . In a society truly ruled by law , these five individuals , including Thomas , would be in prison , convicted of treason . PAUL THOMPSON , Woodstock <p> Personal life is n't public 's business <p> I have been baffled as to why men like Bill Clinton and Clarence Thomas lied to investigators about some of their personal history . It finally dawned on me why . It 's because the things they have lied about are none of our business . As long as certain activities are legal and do no direct harm to others , what any man or woman does in private is not the business of this nation , the voters or anyone else . <p> I do n't blame anyone for lying about his or her personal and private practices to a blaming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up when public officials are questioned about personal lifestyle choices that have absolutely nothing to do with job performance , or anything else for that matter . TIFANY BROTHERIDGE , Duluth <p> Honor heritage by studying Civil War <p> Regarding the Confederate flag issue in Seminole County : Has anyone thought about offering in-depth courses on the Civil War to the public school students in Seminole County ? These kids talk about how the Confederate flag is part of their heritage , but I sincerely doubt their knowledge of the Civil War is very extensive . <p> Honoring the sacrifices of soldiers and remembering the past requires a lot more than wearing a T-shirt to school with a flag on it . The Civil War was a national tragedy that caused incredible misery for myriad Americans . If these kids in Seminole County really want to pay respect to their Southern heritage , then I suggest they make an effort to really study the war and understand it . <p> I also challenge our schools to do more than ban T-shirts . That 's too easy and will solve nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all colors about the defining turning point in our nation 's history . For schools to do otherwise is inexcusable . KIP HOWARD , Marietta <p> Cable snafus are n't worth the trouble , so I 'm getting a dish <p> I am writing to express my concern with AT &T's; apparent purchase of our cable area from Comcast . <p> Unbeknownst to us , AT &T; took over our area , with no official warning or notification . When a large bill came for both cable and Internet service , we called to inquire . AT &T; said it had no record of us as a customer , then referred us to Comcast , who in turn , referred us back to AT &T.; <p> When our service went down on Internet and cable , we waited on hold for two hours before we were hung up on . <p> Now I see that Comcast has bid to buy AT &T's; cable and Internet assets . This could n't be more comical . The sad part is that we still do n't have cable or Internet and receive double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're getting a dish . PHILIP HEROLD , Atlanta <p> Cherokee leaders show backward thinking on ARC <p> Regarding Cherokee County 's attempt to exit the Atlanta Regional Commission : The opinions expressed by the commissioners are typical of the backward thinking that promotes the kind of problems that the ARC is supposed to remedy . The fact that Cherokee has the lowest density is a matter of land area and time . It 's only a matter of time before double-digit growth rates will alter that . We do n't seem to understand that creating higher density , livable urban/suburban centers will in fact preserve more open space and farmland than the usual clear-cut , cul-de-sac-laden subdivisions and cheap , shoddy strip malls . FREDERICK PINCKNEY , Lawrenceville <p> Bush should keep NAACP at bay <p> The NAACP has made it very clear that it has no use for President Bush . For Bush to give this hidebound , racist organization the time of day would be a serious mistake . It is so out of touch with the mainstream that it does n't have a clue about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally comes to realize that it can no longer count on special laws and preferential treatment , it may actually be able to do something worthwhile . But I somehow doubt that day will come . JOHN DENDY , Sugar Hill <p> July Fourth parade too commercialized <p> It is hard for me to describe how disappointed and angry I am following the Salute 2 America Fourth of July parade . There was precious little to do with a celebration of this nation 's birthday in the parade . Granted , a few cars/trucks carried veterans of different wars , but the vast majority of the parade was an unapologetic celebration of self-promotion and consumerism . Floats touted businesses rather than businesses sponsoring theme-appropriate floats . High school bands played popular tunes , and no matter that they did a fine job . I never even heard a Sousa march . <p> I am so disappointed by the flagrant self-promotion exhibited by the majority of participants that next year , I will be sure to look elsewhere for my Independence Day festivities . I challenge promoters of this parade to rethink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Levy 's disappearance is what 's important <p> OK . Now we know that Rep. Gary Condit ( D-Calif. ) is a lying , hypocritical philanderer and that Chandra Levy is an alleged home-wrecker . Is everybody happy ? Now , will someone please tell me what that has to do with Levy 's disappearance ? LLOYD WALKER , Peachtree City <p> Stopping the flow of illegal immigration would save money <p> We must recognize the cost of the United States failing to control its borders . The influx of millions of illegal aliens has hastened the California energy crisis , crowded schools and hobbled the health care system with overrun emergency rooms and the burden of caring for the uninsured . International drug trafficking has destroyed countless lives and has besieged the criminal justice system . <p> Our military is spread so thin guarding other countries ' borders that it ca n't be expected to fill the gaps here . Experts have stated that our greatest threat is from a weapon of mass destruction being smuggled into this country , as opposed to being airborne . <p> Our existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 46 years , so scrap Star Wars and use some of that money to beef up the INS , the Coast Guard and all agencies involved in protecting against an act of terrorism that would dwarf the Oklahoma City bombing . <p> If this country 's laws governing immigration and importation could n't be circumvented , the savings of lives and money would be immeasurable . SCOTT WILBUR , Marietta <p> Take stand against catalog <p> I guarantee that the filth in the Abercrombie &; Fitch catalog would quickly change if the parents of America would rise up and say enough is enough . <p> I have daughters ages 16 and 12 who have never worn any of A &F's; clothes . Of course I do n't pollute their minds , eyes and ears with filthy movies and TV programs , either . If you are unable to do likewise in your home , it 's probably time for you to rise up and be the parent you are called to be . MARQUETTE BROWN , Atlanta <p> On the Web : For information about Abercrombie &; Fitch 's catalog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Let 's see , the DOT shuts down the main route of most tourists and truckers ( most of whom do not live anywhere around here ) , and it can not understand why people were confused . Then it tells these lost drivers to " take I-20 south to the connector . " Well , I-20 does not go south , and most out-of-towners wonder " what the heck is the connector ?
