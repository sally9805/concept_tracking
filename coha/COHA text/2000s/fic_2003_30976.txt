" Dad ! Ma ! McKinley ! Guess what I saw ! " McKinley had been sleeping in the front yard bushes . Hearing the familiar voice , he lifted his head and looked around with sleepy eyes . He was just in time to see Jack , his human pup , skid so fast on his mountain bike that gravel scattered everywhere . The boy leaped off the bike , raced across the place where the cars sat , and ran into the house . Now what ? McKinley wondered . Though he would have liked to sleep more , McKinley stood , yawned , stretched his muscles until they were tight , then relaxed them until they were loose . Shaking his head , he jangled his collar tags , and then ambled toward the house . By the time McKinley reached the door , it had already swung shut . As he had taught himself to do , he bent down , wedged a large forepaw where there was a gap beneath the door , extended his claws , and pushed . The door popped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , McKinley shoved the door further open and squirmed inside . Once there , he sniffed . Smelling dinner , he trotted down the hallway , wagging his tail , till he heard Jack saying , " Dad , I 'm not making it up , I really saw a wolf . " McKinley stopped short . His tail drooped . Was that the wolf word the boy had used ? When he was young  --  Jack had also been much younger  --  McKinley had spotted a wolf during a walk with his people . It was just a glimpse , but the people had seen it , too . They had become very excited , That 's when McKinley learned the wolf word . He could recall the wolf 's reek , a mix of deep woods , dark earth , and fresh meat . Its wildness had frightened him . And excited him . But that was a long time ago . Wide awake now , McKinley hurried past the large room and into the small food place . Jack was talking to the man of the family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McKinley liked him and the way he always smelled of the outdoors . " Now , hang on , Jack . " the man said . " You sure it was n't just a big old German shepherd ? They can look a lot like a wolf . " McKinley stood still , his head cocked . There it was again , the wolf word . " No way , Dad " the human pup answered . " You know how much I 've read about wolves . I 'm sure this was one . I mean , yeah , at first I thought it was McKinley . But it was n't . " Wanting to understand more , McKinley jumped onto one of the sitting places near where the humans put their food when they ate . Mouth slightly open , tail wagging , he sat , turning from the pup to the man as each spoke . " I 'm not saying you 're wrong , " the man said . " Just , if you 're right , it 's pretty amazing . Has n't been a wolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotted one up in the Zirkel Wilderness ? But not here in Steamboat Springs . " McKinley saw Jack look around . " Where 's Mom ? " At the mention of Jack 's female  --  the boy called her Mom , the man called her Sarah  --  McKinley barked once . The woman spent time on Most Cars Way in a place where there was lots of food , and often brought him treats  --  like bones . Gil said , " She has to work the dinner shift . So it 'll be just you and me tonight . Sausages and carrots . And your mom made bread . Now keep talking as you set the table . " Jack A but threw down his eating sticks and tall , clear bowls as he chattered . I was a little scared , " he was saying . " I mean , that wolf redly surprised me . I think I surprised him , too . " The human pup poured water for himself and the man into the tall bowls , then thumped down onto the sitting place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grub , " " the man said as he brought food to the boy and sat across from him . " And I 'm starving . " McKinley , eyeing the food , drooled and licked his own nose . " I was marking trail up by Rabbit Ears Pass all day , " the man said . " Fair amount of snow up there already . Promises a good season . " " Hear that , McKinley ? " Jack cried . " Snow is coming ! " Snow , a word McKinley knew and loved . He barked in appreciation . " But go on , " the man said to the pup . " Tell me exactly what you saw . " Jack spoke between mouthfuls . " See  --  the wolf had this thick , gray fur coat  --  with sort of flecks of gold . His head was wide  --  his muzzle was light colored  --  and I think he had a limp . " " Was he bigger than McKinley ? " Jack turned toward him . McKinley , wishing the human pup would calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . " A lot skinnier , " Jack said , wiping his cheek with the back of a hand . " Longer legs , too . Gray fur . Not blackish . " " You did n't see a collar , did you ? " " No way . " " Describe his eyes . " McKinley watched closely as Jack swallowed the last of the sausage . " Not , you know , brown and round like McKinley 's . Like , sort of yellowish . And , you know , egg-shaped . " The man reached for his tall bowl and drank . Then he said , " Well , that 's certainly wolflike . Where 'd you see him ? " " Up in Strawberry Park . " McKinley yawned with nervousness . Strawberry Park was a small valley outside of Steamboat Springs . It was hemmed in by forested hills , and beyond , by snow-peaked mountains . Looming over everything was the great mountain , where most of the humans did their snow sliding . There were only a few houses in the area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McKinley was head dog there as well as in town . " What were you doing there ? " Gil asked . Jack shrugged . " School was out . I was exploring . " " McKinley with you ? " Jack gave his dog a quick smile . " Wish he was . " Liking the attention , McKinley barked . " Hey , how about feeding him his dinner ? " " McKinley , I 'm sorry ! " The pup leaped up . McKinley watched as jack snatched his food bowl from the floor , then reached into a food box . The boy put some bits into the bowl , added water , and set it back on the ground . As a final touch , he placed two dog biscuits on top . McKinley wagged his tail , jumped off the sitting place , and went for the wet food , gulping down the biscuits first . " Jack , " Gil said , " if that was a wolf  --  and I 'm not saying it was n't  --  there are going to be lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks do n't like wolves . " McKinley stopped eating to look around . There it was again , the wolf word . " I know , Dad , " Jack said . " People say wolves are mean and vicious . They are n't . Look at McKinley . " " McKinley is a malamute , " Gil said . " Not a wolf . " " Part wolf , " Jack insisted . " Well , maybe so , way back . Not now . Look Jack , the point is , this is still ranching country . If people learn there 's a wolf nearby , some of them will be wanting to hunt it down . Kill it . I 'm serious , Jack . Since you like wolves , be smart . Do n't let anybody know what you saw " The words hunt and kill unsettled McKinley . Hunting was not something that Jack 's family did . But there were many humans in town  --  and their dogs  --  who hunted . For McKinley it meant danger . just the sense of it made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Gil asked , " What do you think he 's saying ? " " Wish I knew , " Jack said . First Aladdin Paperbacks edition April 2003
