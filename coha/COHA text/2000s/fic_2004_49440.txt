IN THE OFFICES OF HUMANITY Incorporated , Marjorie , Program Director of Different Path , had her own cubicle . From her desk she could look across the floor directly into the corner nook - not a cubicle really , with only a standing screen to half-partition it off - where Carl Larken had his desk . <p> Larken was on the phone , his chair tilted back , his outthrust feet toed under his desktop , his body poised almost horizontal to the floor . In cutoffs and worn Nikes , a brambly gray beard and raked-back gray locks tendrilled on his neck , the man 's toughness showed . A lean and sunburned man in his fifties . <p> Marjorie tried to decide why Larken stood out so . It was n't his dress . Humanity Inc. was a sizable human services nonprofit , and did n't insist on office drag - most of its program managers had social activist backgrounds and liberal views . What nagged at her was the man 's ... tautness . He was a very personable , articulate guy , sociable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undistracted inwardness . He could be talking to you about your program , deep in the details of a write-up with you , showing perfect grasp and sensitive awareness , and you would suddenly know he was n't really there , was working his tongue and his face like a puppet , flawlessly managing his half of the exchange , light-years away in his mind . Over the months , she had formed the whimsical but persistent notion that Carl Larken was insane . <p> She recognized that this secret alienation she saw in him could be from her own lack of real involvement in her work . She was rich . Her parents owned a flourishing winery . After her B.A. in Fine Arts , a sense of aimlessness had overtaken her . This job was her Term of Involvement with Reality , an immersion in the hard and hurting strata of the world . Different Path was a criminal justice diversionary program , counseling and community services for the drug-riddled , the sick and the desperate . She worked it , pulled her Beemer into the lot at eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house calls , networked with the D.A . ' s office - the whole nine yards . But ultimately , she did n't believe it made any difference . Did n't believe counseling and community service did a thing for the already damaged , the already damned . And her own underlying contempt for her work made her sure of Larken 's . It was a felt thing , a sympathetic vibration between them . <p> Being indifferent , though , was a far cry from being insane . What was there about him , when she studied him from a distance like this , that always ended by sending that cold thrill of suspicion up her spine ? This conviction that the man was not really here , was deeply , utterly somewhere else ? <p> She had to go meet with a counseling group . On impulse , she went over and leaned into Larken 's nook on her way out . <p> " Hi Carl . " <p> " Hey , Marjorie . The Press Republican says they 'll run a feature for us . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " It 's done . Take it with you . I 'm going for a run soon . If you 're out on the road , do n't run me over . " <p> A little standing joke . Larken worked a loose schedule , often taking long midday runs in the nearby countryside . She 'd passed him a number of times , smiling and waving , wondering at what drove the guy - far from young , but every inch of him honed down to sinew and vein and tireless muscle . Heading out , she glanced at the copy of his feature : <p> For those stricken by chemical addictions , shoplifting and other petty property misdemeanors are more the symptoms of an affliction than the acts of a real criminal . At Different Path , with the generous cooperation of the Superior Court of Sonoma County , we take these afflicted folks out of the criminal justice loop , and into a circle of care , counseling , and rehabilitation <p> And so on . The usual . She paused at the exit to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chair , murmuring into the phone . Those humanitarian homilies that he composed so glibly - they did n't really fit the man at all . He had all the standard smiles , the affable , earnest expressions . But the whole shape and aura of him ... he looked about as compassionate as a coyote . <p> Larken 's phone interview with " Dan G. " was going well . It was amazing what people would just tell you about themselves . Back when he had taught at the junior college , he 'd been delighted by how much personal revelation he could draw from his students with his writing assignments . He was always struck by how faintly these kids seemed to feel their own existence . They had to squint to see their own feelings . They had to strain to remember the things they had seen with their own eyes in the course of a single day . But when driven by an instructor , and the need of a grade , they could scrape some of it together , report what life was like for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this straight ... , " Guy Blankenship was " Dan G. 's " real name , which Larken had gotten out of him easily enough , " ... the meth cost you your wife and kids first , and then your house , and now , because you started spiking it , it 's given you AIDS . And you 're what ? Only twenty-six ? " <p> " It did a major number on me . " This was spoken solemnly , almost with a kind of satisfaction . <p> " Well , I have to tell you that your story is one of the most moving ones I 've ever heard , Guy . I want to suggest something to you . I want you to bear with me for a minute here , because I want to suggest an idea to you , and I need to work up to it a little , okay ? " <p> " Sure . I do n't mind . " And you could hear his comfort with the conversation ; Guy was well along in the morphine phase of his AIDS-related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your window , what do you see ? I want to get a feel for your neighborhood . " <p> " Well . Mim 's Market is right across the street , like a mom-and-pop . And boy , those kids with their skateboards and earrings , they like live on the sidewalk in front of it , I swear . " <p> " You 're on Prince over toward the Fairgrounds , right ? " <p> " Right . " <p> " And if you head down Prince , you hit Crestview . You probably turn on Crestview when you go down to the hospital , right ? " <p> " That 's right . " <p> " So Guy , did you ever keep going up Crestview , into the hills behind the Fairgrounds ? " <p> " Yeah . Marjorie took us up there to a picnic like just a few days ago . " <p> " Oh right , she told me that . That 's a great view up there , is n't it , Guy ? Those big crooked oak trees down on the slope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those oaks . You remember them , do n't you ? Huge big crooked old trees ? " <p> " Big trees , yeah , sure . " <p> " Well , just imagine this , okay , Guy ? Imagine a bluejay landing on one of those trees ' branches . Just fluttering down , and landing , pecking up a couple little bugs , peck , peck , and then flying right off again . Say he 's there four seconds . Imagine how brief , how short , his time in that tree was , compared to the whole span of that tree 's life . Just a quick blue blip that scarcely touches the tree at all . And that 's how short your life on this Earth will have been , Guy , when you check out a year or so from now . Your whole stay on this glorious green globe ... it 'll hardly have happened at all . " <p> " ... what 're you ... you 're sayin ' like .... " The guy 's morphine patches definitely had him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this idea , startled by suddenly realizing that his own existence , and his own death , were the focus of this conversation . <p> " I 'm just telling you I feel for you , man . I wanted to share with you the poignance I feel in your situation . My good thoughts go out to you . I 'm going to write up what you gave me . We 'll talk soon , okay ? " <p> " ... okay .... " Guy was more than morphine vague now . You could hear him struggling to bring these imponderables into focus . His own existence . His own death . <p> Larken gently hung up the phone . He very much craved a run . A couple hours chugging down the country blacktop would bring him back to a nearly empty building , and he could put the last few touches on the corporate newsletter . He slipped into his sleeveless running jersey , its once-black laundered to a light gray . Out the back , he broke into an easy trot across the parking lot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops and strip malls , gas stations and burger chains - lots of cars and mucho monoxide .... But after that , the street became a county two-lane which ran past rural lots and sprawling fields , some orchards and dairy farms still surviving here and there , but increasingly , grapevines out to the horizons . <p> He had an easy lope that ate the miles and never tired . He cruised in the tough vehicle of his bone and muscle , lightly oiled with sweat , and thought of his words to Blankenship . Reckless words if the guy should wake up enough to resent them . Reckless if Larken wanted to keep this job . <p> His problem was this exaltation , this high and reckless humor in his heart . For days now it had filled him , sneaked into him at odd moments as he worked , and set his heart floating . A foretremor of hope . A limbic tingle of something approaching - at long , long last ! <p> His meditation as he ran was what it always was out here : Behold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The fields , the far-flung quilt of treelines over the hills , giant hermit oaks , swollen and crooked with vegetal muscle ! Those towering windbreaks of eucalyptus , cascading with silver applause for the wind ! Those hillsides of cattle gorgeously mottled black and white like antique ceramics . Those turkey-vultures hanging on man-sized wingspans above the roadkill feasts which were spread on the two-lane by the hustling Mercedes , Beemers , and SUVs , above all the pizzaed possums and skunks decorating the webbed highways .... <p> Life ! All its parts mortal , but in their aggregate , immortal and unstoppable . Life the star-conqueror . It spread and spread everywhere , slipping itself like a green glove over the bare , steaming bones of the universe . <p> All living things were dangerous miracles . Each tree brimmed with majesty as it wore the light , and the wind moved through it , but anything that lived could blow up in your face . And if you did win your own immortality , then you must live it in the web of these mortal lives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after death after death . And if the beauty of it all - fields farms trees skies suns stars - was almost unendurable now , must not immortality itself kill you if you did attain it ? Kill you with all that excruciating beauty ? <p> His run had passed the two-hour mark , and he decided to push it to three . First , a piss . In recent years , with San Francisco fortunes being pumped into the wine country , new fence lines and country estates had stripped the roadsides of the margins of old-growth trees and weedy coverts wherein a man might duck to pee concealed . Bleeding your lizard now required thought , and retention skills . He chose a crossroad toward a spot he knew . <p> There it was . A rank of big old eucalypti stood between the margin of the road and the fence of a vineyard . In a little strip of brush behind the trees stood the roofless ruin of a little cinder block hut . <p> Several well-trod footpaths crossed the poison oak and foxtail and blackberry vines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hut : castoff shirts and shoes , a torn , stained mattress . He stepped through the concrete door frame . In the center of the heavily littered concrete floor was a little grass-choked drain-grate . He stood there , downloading hours of coffee into it , while high over his unroofed head the cascade-shaped eucalypti splashed and glittered in the breeze . <p> He liked the square solidity of this cinder block hull , which he guessed had been a tool shed . Its simple shape , tucked in this green nook , made him think of a little country temple in ancient Greece . <p> It was surprising how much of the litter in here was discarded clothing . Many a fieldworker who had tended the adjacent vineyard had surely found free sleep-space here in the warm months , and free drinking space , to judge by the beer cans and flattened cardboard of six-packs . Clothes , thrift-store stuff , were something the poor seemed to have in abundance . He noticed as he was zipping up that there was one little snarl of clothing , isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion of personality . <p> Here lay a pair of khaki workpants whose legs seemed to leap , and just above the pants ' waist a red-and-black checked flannel shirt , its sleeves wide-flung , which seemed to be the top half of the same leap . To provide the clinching touch , one black tennis shoe lay just below one of the pantleg 's cuffs . The shoe presented its sole to the cuff , but in every other respect it was oriented perfectly to become the leading foot of this clothes-fossil 's leap . Just rotate the tennie one-eighty around its long axis and the effect would be perfect .... <p> With a sense of ceremony , of an augmented silence surrounding him , he bent and inverted the shoe . <p> The result was remarkably expressive . This was a grand , balletic leap , an outburst of eloquence and power , a leap of jubilation ... or an explosive escape . A surge of will to be shut of it all , to shed the body with one fierce shake , burst free and clear of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surge of inspiration welled up in Larken . He 'd noted a roadkilled possum a little way back down the road . Suppose he .... <p> Do n't weigh it , spontaneity was everything . With a leap of his own , he bolted from the hut , and ran back down the two-lane , retracing his approach . <p> Here was the possum , flat as a puddle , and baked crispy by several days of summer suns . It was a Cubist possum , where inner and outer possum parts - front , back , left , right - all shared the same plane . Hair , intestine , a ten-key piano-fragment of flattened vertebrae , a spill of teeth surrounding one raisin eye , a parenthesis of sinewy tail as naked as a rat 's - all sides of the animal could be possessed at a glance without the trouble of walking around it . <p> Careful not to pause but to move fluidly at the prompting of his imagination , he took out his Buck knife and sawed through one leathery drumstick , obtaining a hind paw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sharp comma . With his trophies he trotted back to the cinder block hut , feeling surer with each stride , more convinced he had found something real . <p> Stepping back inside the hut , Larken felt he was stepping into a pool of waiting silence , a tension of expectation . He knelt , and tucked the bone of the leg into the cuff of the hinder pantleg , so the possum 's little clawed foot was providing the thrust for the leap . Then he tucked the root of the tail through the rearmost belt loop of the slacks . <p> This was a decisive , perfecting touch . The little up-curving tailspike clarified the clothes-fossil 's leap . Its emotion was both gleeful and savagely furious . This was a demon 's frolicsome , vengeful leap . <p> And then , as if his enhancements themselves opened his eyes to a further one , he saw something he had not noticed . A little , flattened hat lying not far above the shirt 's collar . He darted his hands out , half unfolded the hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It was one of those small-brimmed fedoras that bookies in old movies wore , and it was now cocked at just the exact angle to be perched upon the clothes-fossil 's invisible head . <p> Larken was captivated . For a long moment he could only stand and gaze at what he had made . The original fossil was a ghost , and full of a ghost 's haunting questions . And these marsupial parts Larken had given it were an answer , a new touch of evolution . <p> And then he felt a stirring somewhere near ... and realized there was someone else in the little roofless room with him . <p> Though the knowledge crackled through him like lightning , he did not move by the slightest fraction . This Someone Else felt far nearer than anything visible could feel . This Someone 's presence was like a chord struck ever so lightly , a fugitive coherence that reached his nerves without identifiable route through any of his senses . <p> Once long before , bellying cautiously up toward some possibly occupied bump in the jungle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really heard ) the faint thrum of a claymore 's tripwire , as the guy off to that side of him tripped it - Harry Pogue , that had been - and Larken had slammed his face in mud with only that precious nanosecond of micro-noise for warning , and in consequence , Larken had lived , while Pogue 's head had been brightly sprayed across an acre of green . <p> Not a sound he had heard , no . He 'd known it even then . A Someone who had warned , had thrown him a fine filament of intimation , a slender bridge across the abyss of Annihilation Everlasting . <p> A Someone who was with him now . <p> What must Larken do ? What was wanted ? And because he had framed these panicky questions , instead of acting with instant instinct , and drawing understanding after , because in his heart , in his awe , he had hesitated - he could not grasp what must be done , could not capture the deep , veiled prompting . The moment passed , and then Larken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrine . It wanted his withdrawal . <p> He backed out of the hut , slowly , ceremoniously , eyes downcast . He should speak something , some acknowledgment , some valediction . Again , his instincts failed him , no inspiration came , and he completed his withdrawal feeling the silence hanging there sullenly behind him , feeling his tongue-tied failure of grace in this first encounter . <p> MARJORIE GAVE HER CELL phone number to some of her clients at Different Path . She was wryly aware of a certain insincerity in this " personal touch , " because she always left the phone in her Beemer , so she surrendered none of her real privacy with the gesture . It rang as she pulled into the parking structure of the downtown mall . She thought it would be Pat Bonds , her currently significant other . Guy Blankenship 's vague , whiny voice disoriented her for a moment . She carried him and her conversation with him out of the parking structure and into the mall . <p> " It was like ... it was unreal . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my whole life . It was like this bluebird landing on a branch and pecking twice . My whole life was that short ! He just ... told me that . He just said that to me .... " <p> Marjorie , making tracks toward the fountain , where she and Pat were to decide on their dinner destination , was saying things like , " Well that 's ridiculous , Guy ! You 've got your whole life still ahead of you ! " but meanwhile the image of those massive old oak trees , of the bluejay 's quick flutter and flash among their leaves , struck her imagination indelibly as she strode past windows where Technicolor jellybeans gleamed in barrels , and Technicolor lingerie flaunted on headless white mannequins . And just as vividly , she visualized Guy Blankenship then : his plump red underlip , so slack and unprepared ; his narrow , tufted eyebrows - minimal , as if the man was drawn in haste , and economy in materials was a priority . <p> That this poor , simple guy , his past and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard drugs ' erasure , and his future so short ... that this Guy should also be seeing that same bird dance on that green bough , that he should be looking at his existence for the first time in his life like a wise man - it struck Marjorie as a minor miracle that Carl Larken had planted this vision in Guy Blankenship 's mind . <p> And this made her see Larken again as she had once seen him , loping along in the dusk past orchards where the gloom had begun to gather under the tangled branches . He was a wolf-lean , muscled shape in her headlights who turned at her honk and waved as she passed . His face was a shadow-holed mask , the brambly hair thick on his brow like undercover he lurked in . She had feared him then , and she feared him now because she realized that something in her applauded the little mental cruelty he had done to Guy , that soft little twit from whose fingers the gift of life was leaking so swiftly away . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that upsetting kind of talk . " <p> " ... well .... " <p> " I 'll call you tomorrow , Guy . " She clicked off . There was Pat sitting handsomely ankle-on-knee , on one of the ornate benches surrounding the fountain , the picture of understated class . He saluted her with a whitecapped latte , and handed her one of her own as she joined him on the bench . <p> " Fifty more acres of Zin , " he told her . " A done deal . " <p> He was just Marjorie 's age , a bright , mellow guy , with a clarity of ambition beyond his years , who unlike her had no trouble with his class identity : a WineYuppie and proud of it . Bankrolled by his dad , a corporate attorney in San Francisco , Pat 's lack of intellectual pretensions had made him content with the local junior college for the first two years of his B.A. in Business , and he 'd had Carl Larken for an English instructor five or six years ago . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had discovered this funny little piece of common ground , it had struck her that Pat was covertly amused , that he had instantly perceived her hidden interest in the older man . Herself still unsure what that interest was , she told him now how Larken had tweaked Guy 's imagination . " On one level it 's kind of a raw thing to do , " she offered in conclusion . <p> " Telling some terminal guy how short his life 's gon na be ? I guess you could call it that , " Pat smiled . " He 'd get on that note in class , I remember . Mortality , I guess you 'd call it . " <p> " I guess you would . " Smiling back at him . " Would you say , Pat , that Larken was , well , insane ? Like quietly insane ? " <p> There it was , the thing that kept bringing Larken up between them . She thought Pat 's eyes confirmed her question , even while he was saying , " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , right ? They 've got a crazy routine , but they can be really entertaining sometimes . " <p> She let a beat go by . " Would you say , Pat , " ( batting her eyes like the question was occurring to her for the first time ) , " that Larken is , like , quietly insane ? " <p> She wrung a laugh out of him with that . " Well , I remember one thing he told us . He compared a guy being blown apart by a mine to a guy dying of old age . He said the years hit the old guy just like the frags hit the soldier - the years blew the old guy to a fog too , they just took longer to impact him .... But hey , the guy acts like he 's got a purpose . I see him on the road chuggin ' away . Could an insane guy stay in the kind of shape he 's in ? " <p> " You still have n't answered me , but screw it . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Sun was declining when Larken locked the offices ' back door behind him , unlocked his ten-speed and mounted it . <p> He did n't head straight home . He pedaled for hours through town , ricocheting randomly through the city 's maze , whirring down long ranks of street lamps , down streets of houses and treed lawns , down streets of neons and flashing signals - trying to wear out the eagerness and fear that struggled in him . <p> At last it was time to aim his flight out toward the darkness surrounding the city . Along four miles of lampless two-lane , the last two winding through gentle hills , he sped deep into the crickety country night . The waxing Moon , well up , said nearly midnight when he steered into the narrow gravel driveway that branched from the road up into his seven acres of wooded slope . <p> He dismounted and shouldered the bike , carried it up the drive amidst the tree-shadows . He had spread with his own spade this blue-shale gravel . He practiced the skill of silently treading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As he climbed the slope , the leafy gloom chirred with bug life , and breathed down on him the dry scents of bay and manzanita and oak and madrone . Something at least coon-sized skittered in dry leaves upslope of him . A pair of owls were trading their tentative syllables . <p> He branched from his driveway onto a much narrower deer-trail that crooked its way steeply up . Near the crest of his property , on a crescent of levelish ground , a slant-grown oak laid the dome of its branches partly on the grass . Under this crook-ribbed canopy Larken had his sleeping bag . His little aluminum food locker dangled from a branch above his Sierra trail-stove : a number-ten can with its ends cut out and a flap cut in its rim for feeding sticks through . It channeled enough heat from a few handfuls of twigs to boil his oatmeal , and the fire was near invisible at any distance . <p> He unrolled his leather mat and sleeping bag , and lay half-curled around the little stove and its bubbling one-quart pot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his meal with black strap molasses and ate it with a spoon , eating faster as it cooled . <p> Afterward he lay on top of his bag , looking up at the stars that blazed thick through his oak-leaf dome . These hills were a maze of little valleys - in all directions were pocket vineyards , small ranches , country houses . Here and there , faint in distance , dogs sometimes barked , taunted perhaps by fox , coyote , coon , or bobcat . <p> His body lay slumped in fatigue , but his senses ate up the wide-flung night . Homecoming tires hissed on the road , coming fewer and fewer as the stars blazed more thickly . Four-legged things were afoot in several places on his own acres . The peremptory little tearing sounds of what had to be coon paws were shredding something down in the old overgrown garden where potatoes and tomatoes thinly persisted . A clumsier more faintly heard scrabbling , from just about down at the compost heap ... that would be possum . <p> The thought conjured the clothes-fossil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It dawned on him only then . He had found it a footless , anchored thing , but he had left it clawed and shod . And those claws , whose awkwardness on asphalt made the possum the commonest species of road-pizza , made him a nimble traveler up in the trees , a nomad of the arboreal highway . <p> The Someone Else who joined him in that hut today ... could he follow Larken now ? <p> He lay there on the little piece of earth he owned , trying to detect something like a footfall , or a faint , faint click of claw on branch . Toy and terror hammered at his heart . Could he be on the threshold at last , the threshold of the thing he had sought all his life ? He had exiled himself from so much , left his precious family behind - Jolly , his wife , sweet Maxie and sweet little Jack , his daughter and son .... <p> He could not bear to think of them , of leaving them behind forever . How many years now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had stepped into this absolute solitude .... <p> Perhaps a half mile off , coyote voices began kindling , as if in direct answer to his train of thought . Of course the settling in of the midnight chill - as now - was often the signal for their song . Larken was wary of seeing omens everywhere , the mark of the lunatic . Still .... It had been coyotes who had conveyed to Larken his first revelation - had shown him the promise for whose sake he had left his dearly beloved ones behind . The animals ' ghostly sound was wholly undoglike . It was a giddy wailing and hooting , a sardonic gibbering - the music of exiled demons begging for readmittance to the underworld . <p> LARKEN HAD LONG made a practice of extended moonlit treks through the hills . All this land was owned , of course , and so there would be fences even in the deepest hills - fences around the vineyards , around the more sprawling yellow-grass ranches where cattle grazed , around the country estates . He carried a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penetrate . When he had to pass near houses , he found it amusing to revive his jungle patrol skills , learned so well in Vietnam , modified for this sparser cover . <p> His goal was the entry of the hills themselves , to move through them as their inhabitant , as linked to the Earth as any fox , as roofed by the sky . His night vision , given only a strong Moon to work with , was excellent , as were his skills for quiet movement , and he had surprised many a deer on his travels , a silver fox , and twice a wildcat , but never , before that night , a coyote . <p> It seemed they caught your slightest move a mile away , and politely , invariably declined contact . And yet they went everywhere in these hills . They fed from men 's very decks and porches , fearlessly devouring unwary cats and small dogs practically from their owners ' laps . The coyotes filled their world to the brim without once confronting the simian squatters who claimed every foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing every other natural denizen - even , rarely , the foxes - but never , to Larken 's knowledge , claiming a single coyote as roadkill . Like colliding galaxies , the two nations drifted right through each other - or theirs drifted through ours . <p> It had been a windy night , that night where his life had taken its turning . The atmosphere , in flood , was trying to wash the trees right off the hills . The big oaks twisted and shuddered like black flames in the moonlight , and the white grass rippled and bannered . <p> The wind that night made him feel his chronic longing . The wind , trying to stampede the trees , was roaring for a grand , universal departure to another solar system , a better deal , and the grass struggled to join the rootless giant of the air . All that lives strives to fly , to master time . All tribes of beings strain to rise in insurrection , all knowing their time is short , all , when the wind blows , wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth , up to the last ridge line before the plain , where the city glowed . He rounded a hill-shoulder toward a vantage point he liked when , completing the curve , he stopped just short of walking into three coyotes who were oppositely bound . All four of them froze , and stood staring at each other . <p> The gibbous Moon , declining at Larken 's back , put a glint in the six canine eyes . He looked at each in turn , and settled on the eyes , not of the largest , but of the one who stood foremost , a lean bitch with a jaw that was slightly crooked . <p> Larken was moved by their beauty , not the least uncomfortable . At first he thought they were shocked , embarrassed even at this direct discovery . Animal etiquette would call for a slow side step , a careful withdrawal that avoided any signal of a wish to flee .... But the bitch , head low , stood planted , fixedly regarding him . Though the wind was contrary , she dabbed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the same , were probably her big-grown pups , still in training for all their size . <p> The fixity of their stare became fascinating to him . He dabbed his own face at them , snuffed their air , in case this was a necessary greeting . Snuffed , and a whiff of something ice-cold came to him . <p> It was a scent of ... terror . Awe . The coyotes reeked of it ... it was raising their hackles , was causing them to crouch and tense .... <p> He watched enraptured , until it dawned on him , finally came to him . He turned - the turning seemed to take forever - turned to look behind him . <p> Hovering above the wind-whipped grass , revealed against the distant fields of city lights behind it , something towered in the air , a transparent something that twisted the lightfield into a snarled weave , as if the lights were a colored net just barely containing the fight of a huge translucent catch . <p> Even as he struggled to make out its giant form ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The city lights gleamed undisturbed . <p> The coyotes stirred now , shaking off their holy awe . They gazed at Larken a moment , perhaps with interest . Then they turned , wet muzzles glinting in the moonlight , and melted into the grass . <p> Larken stood there . All his life - long before ' Nam , which had just clarified it - all his life he had longed to find this doorway , this path that could lead him off the treadmill of time and death . <p> His legs buckled under , he dropped like lead and sat in the deep grass , staring at the lightfield where that Someone had stood . He found himself slowed to a synchrony with the Earth-clock itself , and sat there unmoving as the starfield inched across the sky . He then knew that when he returned to his wife and children , it would be to take his leave of them forever . <p> He knew he had been mocked in this revelation . Here he 'd been tramping through the night , the earnest searcher , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How long had this Someone mocked him ? <p> How long had this Someone mocked Larken ? Back through the decades , had every cloud of crows that burst in flight before him been , in reality , exploding in mirth at oncoming Larken with his giant follower , the derisive god behind him ? <p> Well , it was the gods ' prerogative to mock . Larken had been shown at last . He had accrued fifty years of spiritual hunger , poverty and nonentity and finally , it seemed , had amassed his down payment on eternity . <p> Oh the price ! It was an unending agony to pay , to be denied forever dear Jolly , sweet , sweet Maxie and Jack . But it was a father 's place to die before his children , to show them , with his calm as he steps out into the great Dark , that they have nothing to fear , that their own path will be bearable . How could he abide with them while they aged year by year , and he aged no further ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond tonight , than to learn that he was not of their world , and was to live beyond even his own memory of their existence . <p> So when that morning 's Sun rose , Carl Larken turned forever onto his present path , and lived in solitude . <p> He smiled a barbed smile now that tore his heart , and felt the scald of bitter tears . He 'd put down everything he had that very day - turned aside from his life , and the careless god , having beckoned him , had left him hanging , utterly alone , these three years since . <p> But what are years to a god ? What are a man 's tears ? And now the god , or perhaps the god 's messenger , had touched him between the eyes , and run a finger down his spine . Said Yes . I am here . <p> Larken crushed out his coals , washed out his oatmeal pan from the jug of water in his food locker - locked everything up and rehung it from the branch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the oak to a level spot , and lay down , still clothed , on top of the bag , lay scanning the thick strew of stars visible through this gap in the trees . <p> And heard , or almost heard , that faint , clawed tread - the clothes-ghost he had conjured , coming now , drawing nearer , coming to offer Larken what he had lived for . Coming to tell him the price . <p> He realized it did n't matter whether he actually heard this or not . Because now , after fifty-five years , he was about to step up to his threshold and confront the god . This had been granted , he knew it in his spine . <p> Strangely , the most immediate effect on him was not jubilation , but a renewed agony at the price he had paid for this victory . Dear Christ , his precious Jolly ! His precious Maxie , and little Jack ! Eternal exile from them ! How had he mustered the strength , the resolution ? <p> They were his only riches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His and Jolly 's first years together , after he had come back , drugged and raging , from the war , had been dissolute years . They drank and drugged and fucked and fought . On the wings of substances , as they took wobbly flight together , he had tried to show her his most private faith - his mad hope that time could be broken like shackles , and a soul , a fiercely desiring soul , could burn forever . <p> But then priceless , accidental Maxie befell them , and Jolly became wholly Mother overnight . Larken himself took three more years , sullenly sucking booze and powders , before turning to at last , and taking on his fatherhood . By then , equally accidental Jack had arrived , and the rusty doors of Larken 's heart were forced all the way open . <p> In that deep , tricky torrent of parental love and nurturing , the next fourteen years fled away . The immortal fire persisted in Larken 's inmost self , but he could not share it with his children . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic he would lose if he tried to bestow it . His children 's minds grew strong and agile , but he could not find the words . Before he knew it , Maxie was in middle school , Jack just graduating elementary . Behold , they had friends , passionate interests , lives laid out before them in the world ! They had already left him when at last the god vouchsafed to beckon him . Only that made it possible for him to renounce them . <p> He wiped his tears and listened to the night . The price he had paid was past counting , but his purchase was vast . He had bought nothing less than this whole world , night and day , north and south , now and forever . Was he insane , to feel this reckless certainty ? Was n't this blasphemy ? Hubris ? Would n't it cost him his prize ? <p> He could not think so . This bitter joy refused to leave him . He listened to the night , deep night now , where living things moved quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved very carefully , small-footed through the scarcely rustling oak leaves . Far down on the two-lane he heard the faint , awkward scutch of a skunk ( awkward as possums , skunks ) beginning to cross the asphalt . <p> Whoops . Far down the two-lane , the beefy growl of a grunt-mobile . Enter Man on the stage of night , roaring high , wide and handsome in a muscle-truck - a tinny sprinkle of radio music above the roar . Closing fast , with a coming-home-from-the-bar aura . It must be just after two .... <p> Larken listened to the tires as it roared near , roared past - and yes , there it came , that **25;2109;TOOLONG as the skunk was taken for a high-speed dribble down the court beneath the sixty-mile-an-hour underframe of the truck . <p> He lay listening . All the dyings ! Everywhere , all the time . The coyotes announced themselves , very far off now , but with the gibbering intensity of a group kill . Webbed wings made a tiny , soft commotion - a bat , zigzagging bugs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gutted things settling down to decay .... He felt a shift in his bowels . <p> He rose and got his little entrenching tool , and a small canteen of water - set out slantwise up the hill , and upwind of his camp . <p> High on the slope , he crouched on a crescent of deep soil , and a fine , round shit came loose from him . Filling his cupped hand from the canteen , he washed and rinsed himself , and washed his hands . He buried his accomplishments , thinking how coyotes and foxes left their scat right on the trail . When those animals retraced their steps at later times , they nosed the scats and knew themselves , sniffed the ghosts of previous meals . Each time they nosed the fading map of former days , the ever-fainter proofs of their own being , dwindling to rumors . Was this their sense of Time ? <p> Men , more murderous animals , secreted their shit , hiding the lees of their innumerable victims ... fearing vengeance ? <p> Larken must make an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... something for a heart . <p> PRECISELY AT THE SUN 'S first kindling on the eastern hills , Larken , his bike propped by a tree , stood again before the little cinder block shrine . <p> He had pedaled for an hour in the dawn 's light , scouting the country roads for a fit offering . He had hoped for the rare luck to find something he 'd happened on before : a road-struck animal whose life had not yet left it . He remembered once running , and coming up eye to eye with a possum that had not yet finished dying . There was still a little bit of him left there in his inky little possum 's eyes . The beast was looking back forgetfully at life , looking into Larken 's eyes forgetful that he was human , seeming to struggle to remember something they had in common long ago .... <p> Had he been given such a find it would have amounted to an omen from the god that his improvised ritual was welcomed . As it was , he found a rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ruffled by the breeze , had caught his eye . The fox was beautifully intact - back-broken , not mauled - and dead not very many days . <p> This was much , he reflected as he eased it into his old khaki knapsack . Enough to be a kind of warrant from the god . Foxes , these sharp-muzzled tricksters , were almost never nailed by monkey Man 's grunting pig machines . He had to pedal hard to bring this rarity to the shrine before the Sun 's rising , and made it there just at the instant that the first light struck the gray wall . <p> He knew , seeing that , that this rite of his was welcomed , and the god was present to receive his offering . <p> He stepped inside , his knapsack cupped before him in both hands . The clothes-ghost seemed to float on the floor , to glow , so full of feral insolence , of fierce and graceful glee its posture was . Under the hat 's slanted bill , the spark of an eye almost glinted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that clawed foot .... It knew ! <p> Larken knelt down slowly on one knee . He felt the ghost 's seething aura of energy , waiting for Larken to find the awakening magic to give him form and force . <p> He drew the reeking fox-that-was from the sack . Sun had shrunk its tendons - there was a stiffness that made the little corpse more wieldy . He gripped the gray pelt at the spine just below the neck , and with his other hand , lifted one flap of the ghost 's shirt . He felt no need for words . He shrouded the fox inside the ghost 's shirt , willing spirit into this inhuman gatekeeper . His hidden hand felt in an alien space , felt the heat and menace of a hostile dimension . <p> Just as he withdrew his hand , it was powerfully , searingly bitten . <p> Torn to the bone , both the palm and the back of his hand . Blood , its astonishing crimson , welled blazing out of him in the morning light . <p> He stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this a message ? <p> What was the message ? <p> An engine , something big and huffy , was idling not far off . Larken had to stand a moment , struggling to decide if the sound came from that eternal world where his hand had been torn , or from this one his feet were planted on . <p> He seized up a sun-bleached fragment of T-shirt from one corner , bound his hand and knotted it with his teeth . The bandage went instantly red as he thrust the hand inside the light windbreaker he wore . His bike outside already declared him . He stepped out into the slanting Sun , picked up his bike with his left hand , and stepped through the trees to the road with it . A young man stood by a black Jeep Cherokee , arm draped on the roof . <p> Larken smiled easily at him , straddled his bike with his hand still tucked away , stood on one pedal and slowly coasted over to him . <p> " The pause that refreshes , " he said to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Larken ! " <p> Larken , when teaching junior college , had infallibly Mistered and Mized all his students , and after a beat , he said , " Mr. Bonds ! This is a pleasure ! Is this your ... estate you 're viewing ? " <p> Pat was remembering Marjorie 's question yesterday . No doubt about it , there was something subtly but deeply not normal about this guy . He steps out of a ruined shed at dawn , steps smiling out of the trees with his hidden hand making what looked like it might be a bloodstain in the armpit of his jacket , then cruises over to Pat , totally suave and smiling . And not only does he remember Pat after what , six years ? But he even remembers the little standing jokes between them about Pat 's pragmatism , his fiscal realism , his good-humored disinterest in big ideas . <p> The old man had a real ... charisma . Complete self-possession . But sitting here with a bloodstain spreading across his jacket , having just stepped out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a little unreal . <p> " I do n't own these grapes themselves . I 'm in the development sector of the viticulture industry . We design acquisitions , financing . We 're going to get fifty more acres of Zin out of this field . " <p> Larken looked across a sea of grapes from fence to fence . " Where are you going to get it ? " <p> " Here and there along the margins . We 'll get a good ten acres here when we tear out that shed and this border strip . " <p> At this Larken just nodded , but he let a beat go by . " Are you leaving any eucalyptus ? " <p> " Just one line at the roadside . We 'll take those out later this year . They create a shadowing problem for the new acres . " Pat found himself getting a little suffer as he went on . He still amused Larken on a level he did n't get . That was okay when he was the guy 's student - a teacher is supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective . But this man , this whacko old man with his chickenfeed job , found something genuinely funny about the way Pat was , after all , engineering this entire environment here . <p> And the man seemed to sense his thought . " A world-shaper , " he smiled at Pat . " I saw it long ago . " <p> " Well , every generation shapes things , right ? Every generation makes what they can , builds what they can make use of . " <p> " You are absolutely right , Mr. Bonds . You ca n't take a single step on this old globe without changing it . So when are you clearing this section ? " <p> " Tomorrow . " And Pat had scored something , he felt it . Where 's your contempt for money and power now , he asked the old man in his mind . There 's something he values here , and just twenty-four hours from now I 'm making it disappear . <p> Then Larken smiled again . " Time is on the wing , is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got to get to work . Good to see you ! " <p> When Larken had pedaled off , right hand still tucked beneath his arm , Pat entered the weedy margin behind the trees . He wondered how he 'd failed to ask Larken how he hurt his hand . He stepped into the cinder block shed . <p> Nothing . Trash and discarded clothing everywhere . Just a useless eyesore . A perfect place to be scraped clean . Developed . <p> As he climbed back in his Jeep , he thought of Larken 's eyes , gray eyes under shaggy brows . There was an intention behind those eyes , something fixed and unyielding . What might a trashy nook like this one here mean to a war-scarred old guy like that , a bookish man of the kind who brooded about big ideas ? Who could tell ? The fact remained that , just meeting Larken 's eyes as he 'd emerged from that shed , Pat had felt like a trespasser here . <p> Marjorie was northbound on 101 . The three P.M. traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south of town , where she was already fifteen minutes late for coffee with Pat at Espresso Buono . When she reached him on his cell phone , she could tell that he , too , was carbound . <p> " Where are you , Pat ? " <p> " One-oh-one . I 'm just above Novato . " <p> " Christ , you 're thirty miles behind me . I 'm just north of Rodent Park . " <p> " Things ran late at the title company . " <p> " It 's kind of romantic , Pat , the two of us just cruising the traffic-stream together , trading sweet nothings . " <p> " Are you actually cruising that close to town ? " <p> " Actually no , it 's creep and crawl .... " Should she tell him ? On the phone like this ? " I was just down in Petaluma . I had to go see the mother of the guy I told you about , Guy Blankenship ? he had morphine patches , right ? Well he , like , put on half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's dead . He left a note , or he started a note . It said tell Carl . " <p> " Whoa . " <p> " Right . Well , the police asked me about it . It 's a wrongful death , right ? I said I did n't know who it was . I said I 'd look into it and maybe get back to them . " <p> " Did you tell Larken ? " <p> " He did n't come to work today , and he does n't have a phone . " <p> A little silence passed between them . Marjorie was picturing Carl Larken out for a run along some two-lane . She pictured the city ahead of her and thought of it semi-abstractly as an environment , as the habitat of Larken . That gaunt graybeard , implacable as Jeremiah . Picturing him like this , it seemed incredible to her that she had not seen his madness sooner . He was no longer a creature of civilization . He was like an animal that infiltrated the city by day , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost auraed with otherness . <p> " Hey , Marjo ? Tell the police . It 's no harm to Larken . They 'll hard-time him a little is all , and maybe he needs a little accountability check here . " <p> Marjorie laughed , thinking of the vivid Mrs. Blankenship , whose ramshackle house she had just left - the woman a bleached , cigarette-throated , leather-vested speedfreak . " No harm ? If they told his mother , and she found someone smart enough to help her with it , she 'd sue the corporation 's socks off . " <p> " You know I ran into him this morning ? " <p> Larken lost himself in an endless patrol , beelining across the hills . He carried his little boltcutter for the stubbornest fences . He crossed pasture and vineyard and tree-choked streamcourse . Carefully void of intention , he chose his course as randomly as he could . <p> In these hills he had at last been shown , invited . Now , as Time closed in on him , these hills must show him his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hour after hour . <p> The Sun had begun to wester . When he was startled out of his walking reverie , he was amazed to realize just how oblivious he 'd been . Aware of nothing but these acres of rolling pasture dropping away before him , when close behind him , a voice said , " I see you have a boltcutter there . Is that what you used to cut through my fence ? " <p> When he turned , there was a frail old woman walking toward him from a Jeep - the old-fashioned military-looking kind - parked a short way down the fire-break path his feet had been treading so automatically . <p> The lady wore khaki work clothes , and a gray canvas hat with a little circular brim . She was so frail ; hair as wispy as web escaped the hat . She was frail and there was something else about her-a scent he could almost pick up . " You 've done it before , too , have n't you ? " she urged , her voice very level , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow a beeline across people 's property . " <p> He smiled gently . " You 've determined to call the devil by his name , right to his face , hesitation be damned , " he said with admiration . " From now on you 're not going to waste time with caution . " <p> " I never have . You talk about caution . Am I in danger here from you ? " <p> He had been honestly absorbed in her . She would be an omen , of course ! Part of the answer he was after . But when she asked him this question , it stunned him for a moment , the alienness of the notion that he should lift his hand against her frailty . And in that moment he identified that faint scent she had . Chemotherapy . <p> " You are correct , Ma'am , " he was saying , " I do make beelines . I damage as little fence as possible , but sometimes I need to follow the route I 'm feeling . You are in absolutely no danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty uncouth appearance , but I 'm a good person . I did two tours in Vietnam , a lot of them in-country , and I guess it 's left me a little reclusive . " <p> The slopes of dried grass below them were growing golder in the slanting Sun . That rich light flooded her face with such detail . Blue veins across her forehead , the fine-china translucence of her wrinkled eyelid , her hair 's sparseness betrayed by the looseness of her hat . She watched him as he spoke , not so much listening to his words as following her own train of thought about him . " You tell me I 've decided not to waste time on caution . You seem to be telling me that I 'm obviously someone with not much time left . Suppose that 's true . Why should that make me care any less about vandalism to my property ? " <p> " When I ventured that description of your state of mind , Ma'am , I meant to express my admiration . I do n't dispute the wrongness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I did no harm to your property - " <p> " Except to its boundary ! " <p> " Except to its fence . May I guess , Ma'am ? Are you that little beef ranch , a hundred acres or so , triple-strand barbed wire ? " Her icy look was as good as a nod . " I will of course pay you whatever damages you see fit . " <p> Again , she seemed , rather than listening , to be struggling to digest him . " I 've seen you on the roads , you know , over the years - running , cycling . I 've seen you running out of your driveway . You call yourself a recluse , and I 've had exactly that thought about you as I drove past , that you were a kind of hermit . Completely in your own world . " <p> " But are n't you completely in yours ? " <p> " Are you hinting again ? That you know I 'm dying ? " <p> " I 'm just trying for an understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fast as I am . " Almost wry here , her fragile , skull-stretched face . He could sense her mood exactly . She was partly lured by an unlooked-for understander of her plight , but equally was stung by his understanding . In the pinch , she reverted to legalities . " I called the sheriff on my cell phone as soon as I found the damage , and I told them I suspected you . I felt a little bad about that , not being positive , but then I took the Jeep out , and found you practically red-handed . " <p> Understanding flooded him . This woman was not an omen to him , she was more than that . She was in herself a gift , a token of passage . He understood now the garish Sign that had been given him , in return for his morning 's offering : his right hand full of blood . <p> " I 'm sure , of course , " she was saying , " that the officers , after writing up a report , will let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden light ! It was beginning to shade over to voluptuous red-gold . Hills rolled away on all sides , and the two of them stood bathed in this ocean of light , and at the same time , they were utterly unwitnessed by another human . Perfectly alone together in all this big emptiness , with the royal Sun , alone , looking on . Larken , before setting out on his day 's quest , had made and properly tied a bandage for his right hand , though the red stain had seeped through even this one . Perhaps because she sensed his own sudden awareness of it , she took note of his wound for the first time . " How did you hurt your hand ? " <p> He smiled apologetically . " I was bitten . " <p> " Bitten by what ? " <p> " I was bitten by a god . A god who is about to break out from these hills . Is about to hatch from them . He has promised me ... immortality . " <p> He had her full , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Out of the deep tear in his flesh , black-scabbed though it was , the naked tendons peeked . <p> The setting Sun gilded the trenched meat , and it glowed like a sacrament . <p> Deep night . The county road far below him had at last gone quiet and empty . <p> The darkness , even after these long hours of it , still felt like a balm to Larken , as if the bright work of blood-spilling that he had done today had scorched his retinas , and made sunlight agony to them . <p> He lay far upslope under one of his oak trees , his own hillside rock-solid under his back . He lay perfectly still , wholly relaxed , so that the vast crickety sound of the night felt like a deep lake he sank in , deeper with each heartbeat into the creaking , trilling music of the Earth 's nocturne . <p> And then , woven into that vast music , it began to be faintly , sinisterly audible . <p> So far off at first , so sketchy : a jostle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Something moving through the leafy canopy , something small and very far , picking its way from branch to branch . It meandered , finding its path through contiguous trees , but it was seeking him . <p> To Larken 's ears this faint advance might as well have been thunder , for there was nothing else in the world but it . Because the Earth was opening beneath him . This visitation he had bought with human blood would leave him changed forever , would actually begin his removal from this world , and his advance toward eternity . He lay there , waiting as he had waited all his conscious life , to step off of the Earth , and into the universe . <p> It was n't as small as it had sounded , now that it was working its way up the slopes of Larken 's property . He began to hear a muscular agility , which had helped to mute its approach but , nearing , betrayed a solid mass laddering its way through the branches and boughs . <p> Just a short way down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a stop . In the short silence that followed , Larken felt an alien intent grow focused on him . <p> Sssssssst . <p> It was a summons , and its echo changed the air as it drifted up among the oaks and madrones . The night mist grew more spacious , its very molecules drawing apart , as if mimicking the separations of the stars themselves . <p> He got to his feet , and doing so took forever , his legs , hands , arms slow travelers across the interstellar emptiness that had entered each cubic foot of the night air . He threaded downslope through bushes - manzanita , scrub oak , bay , scotch broom - that were abstract silhouettes , like archetypes , but whose odors , rich and distinct , filled him with a terrible nostalgia for that mortal world that he was now abandoning . <p> He stopped , doubting that he dared , after all , all , all ... to do this . It spoke again instantly , in answer to his hesitation : <p> Sssssssst . <p> Down he walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mist and shadow .... <p> Here was the big oak tree that marked an arc of level ground where Larken 's long-defunct compost patch lay . Up in its branches was where his caller awaited him . It seemed that from the tree 's overarching mass a fine , impalpable panic rained down . As if the tree itself , that crooked old leafy mortal , radiated its terror at what this man was bent on doing . Larken stood in this faint rain of fear , like a warning breathed down by the tree . <p> Though his fear was dire , his hesitation had left him . His legs had carried him too many miles and years on this path to retreat from its terminus . <p> Its terminus , this compost patch - a sunken crust now which the oak 's canopy overhung . A dried , sunken , vegetal crust which to Larken was terror itself , a patch of Absolute Zero . He came to the brink of the worst place on Earth . <p> There was a small , energetic commotion in the oak 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes but gaudier , dangled into view from the lowest bough . These shoes were blazoned with stripes and chevrons in sweeping curves of some glossy material colored copper and silver , and dully luminous , burnished , giving off an inner light . Short legs followed , too-short legs sheathed in baggy cholo-pants whose excess material stacked in bulges on the shoes ' tops . <p> This was the dreadful ripening of what Larken had lived to summon , and only the combined weight of his whole past life - though such a frail , slight weight it seemed now ! - sufficed to hold him steady on his legs , sufficed to plant him to confront this strange fruit 's falling , at long last . <p> The visitant dropped to the ground and stood entire upon the crusty mat . He was a natty little monster three feet high . The whiskered , ' gator-toothed snout of a possum was likest to the face he thrust forth with a loll-tongued leer of greeting . He was jauntily hatted with a snap-brimmed bookie 's fedora of straw - or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hat was cocked arrogantly over one beady black eye . His baggy black sportscoat was hung up at the back on the upthrust sickle of his tail , a huge rat 's tail , a stiff , dried tail , a comma of carrion whose roadkill scent Larken caught on the cold air of this eternity . <p> The visitant hissed , Feeeed me - its tongue , a limber spike of black meat , stirring in its narrow nest of canines . <p> Larken discovered at his side something he had not noticed : a shovel standing upright , stabbed into the earth . <p> Stepping out of an airplane into an alien night sky above Vietnam had been nothing to this , but Larken did it in the same kind of here-I-go instant : he took up the shovel , and stabbed it into the scab of compost . <p> He dug , knowing without thinking exactly where to dig . <p> It was his own heart he shoveled out chunks of and spilled to one side . <p> The shovel was heavy and cold , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tooth , chewing up lives and spitting them out . It bit out his heart , and dumped it to one side . <p> He had not understood . He would not have done it if he had known how they were to serve . <p> Careful , very careful he was near the depth that he knew . He knelt at the last , and scraped the soil away with his hands . <p> He uncovered a little arm , the slender , bow-and-arrow arc of two bones , the flesh all but moldered away . He stood up and turned away , his tears streaming down for those precious bones , that little arm . <p> The visitant 's steps crunched across the compost . Something much more massive than that dapper little monster it sounded like . The monster 's littleness was so dense with greed , as dense as the heart of a neutron star . <p> Larken stood with his back turned , tears streaming , as the Messenger feasted behind him , as it ripped at the compost and soil in a horrid undressing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sound of its feeding , the gnashing and guttural guzzling , long it lasted , and he would carry that sound into eternity . <p> When the meal was done , the visitant spoke again . <p> The price is two more . They are here . <p> And Larken heard a distant purr and crackle , car tires crunching up his drive . He turned and saw glints of headlights far below , and the beam of a patrol car 's searchlight climbing the twisted ribbon of gravel . <p> The first officer said , " Christ . It 's abandoned . " Their headlights , as they pulled up onto the narrow plateau where the driveway ended , flooded against a little house walled in weeds and vines , its roof a thick sloping scalp of dead leaves a foot deep sprouting grass also dead now in the dry fall . <p> They got out and splashed their flashlight beams across windows opaque with rain-spotted dust . They approached the gaping front door , and poured their beams inside , across furniture blurred by dust and leaves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer . " We 're not gon na find him here . " <p> The first shrugged . " Some indications of whereabouts , maybe . " <p> They moved farther into the house , and the floor felt the same underfoot as the ground had . Their beams woke a startling scuttle and scramble of animal paws . They tried light switches that did n't work . Kitchen and living room conjoined with no wall between . The second officer began to search these rooms . <p> The first officer followed a short hallway farther inside . The hallway was festooned with dusty cobwebs , and behind this dust , was walled with books , books , books , their ranked titles like muffled shouts and exclamations choking in the dark . <p> Insanity . Right here . If the guy 's brain was packed with all these mummified shouts , then the missing woman was dead . The officer , though he tingled with this intuition , dismissed it as ungrounded , at least so far . There was no denying , though , that to leave a house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indicated some kind of insanity - if it did n't prove homicide . <p> The door to the bathroom opened off this hall . <p> Tacked to the bathroom door was a drawing . It was clearly a very old one , done with pencils and colored markers . It was divided in panels on an oversize sheet of art paper . In each panel the father , small daughter , and smaller son appeared to be self-drawn . The panels presented a narrative : The trio find their cat nursing five kittens . The family dog licks the kittens while the mother cat stands by with raised hackles and fluffed-out tail . They carry the kittens in a box . They stand in front of a supermarket with the box , the little girl handing a kitten to another little girl . The kittens look like slugs with pointed ears and tails . Dad is clownishly self-drawn with big ears and wild hair , the little girl very precisely drawn with pony tail and bangs and a pretty dress , the boy drawn with barely controlled energy , head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair all energetic spikes . <p> The officer heard a shift of mass , a sigh . <p> " Ted ? " <p> A big , sinewy shape stood in his flashlight beam . The officer struggled to clear his sidearm . <p> " I 'm sorry , " the shape said sadly , and cut his throat . <p> UP BEFORE SUNRISE . Marjorie hated getting out of bed in the dark , but loved the payoff once she was dressed and rolling down the country roads in the first light , cruising and owning them almost alone . The countryside here used to be a lot more interesting , though . She remembered it in her girlhood - orchards , small ranches , farmhouses , each one of these houses a distinct personality .... Money , she thought wryly , scanning the endless miles of grapevines , all identically wired and braced and drip-lined , mile after mile - money was such a powerful organizer . <p> As the dawn light gained strength , and bathed the endless vines in tarnished silver , it struck her that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could run loose in the world like a mythic monster , gobbling up houses and trees , serving strictly its own monstrous appetite . <p> But there was Pat and his crew ahead . Abright red Japanese earthmover - skiploader in front , backhoe behind - had already bladed out the wide strip of bramble and weed between the vineyard fence and the roadside rank of eucalyptus . The mangled vegetation had already been heaped in a bright orange dump truck which was now pulling out for the dump , passing Marjorie as she approached . The next load the truck would be returning for had not yet been created , but Marjorie could see what it would be . The earthmover , with its backhoe foremost now , stood confronting the cinder block shed . The hydraulic hoe 's mighty bucket-hand rested knuckles-down against the earth , like the fist of a wrestling opponent , awaiting the onset . Its motor idled while its short , stolid Mexican operator had dismounted to confer with Pat . <p> And instantly Marjorie forgave money , loved and trusted it again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's will . And just look at that cleanness and order it had created . Where there had been tangle and dirtiness and trash before , was now clean bare dirt , reddish in the rising light , beside the columned trees . <p> Pat stepped smiling out to the road . " Good morning ! You look radiant ! " <p> " I look that tired , huh ? " <p> " Nothing some Espresso Buono wo n't fix when we head out of here . I did n't expect you 'd actually come out . " <p> They had n't been able to make yesterday 's date , Marjorie going instead to make her report to the police , but they 'd agreed she might meet him for this morning 's early business . Why exactly had she come ? " I figured , " she said sweetly , " that if we grabbed a date this early , we 'd actually get to see each other . " <p> He nodded , but added , " Did you have the thought that Larken might show up ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " I guess I have . Look , pull off into that drive down there . This wo n't take half an hour . Come watch this Nipponese brute do its stuff . " <p> She pulled off about a hundred feet downroad , in the driveway of the fieldhands ' little house . As she parked she saw Pat in her rearview , lifting his arm in greeting to someone beyond him . She got out and saw , about a hundred feet uproad of Pat , Carl Larken come coasting on his bike , one bandaged hand raised in salute . <p> He dismounted still a little distance off , leaned his bike on a tree , and began walking toward the men and their machine . <p> Marjorie had to gather herself a moment before approaching . She must tell Carl simply and honestly about the report she 'd made . It was not , after all , a criminal matter , but there would have to be discussions with the police . There were accountability issues here . She began to walk toward them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave of nausea move up into her through her legs . <p> She froze , utterly disoriented by the sensation . The ground beneath her feet was ... feeding terror up into her body . She stood , almost comically arrested in midstride . What was this panic crawling out of the Earth ? It had something to do with Carl Larken down there , approaching the men from the opposite direction , something to do with the impact of his feet on the fresh-scraped earth . <p> Look at his slow liquid gait , all muscle up his legs and arms . He was so here , he pressed with impossible mass against the Earth . Suddenly all this regimented greenery , this whole army of rank-and-file vegetation , seemed to belong to him , while Pat and his helper and their bright machine had a slightly startled , caught-in-the-act air . <p> Marjorie gripped the trunk of a eucalyptus , but even the hugeness of the tree against her felt flimsy in this radioactive sleet of fear that was blazing from the ground beneath them both . <p> Pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Larken came to within fifteen feet or so , and stopped . It seemed to Marjorie , even at her little distance , that the mass of him dented the Earth , putting the two lighter men in danger of falling toward him . His voice was gentle . <p> " Good Morning , Mr. Bonds . Senor . " A faint smile for the operator . " I 'm really sorry to intrude . I have to make use of this ... land you own . It is a purely ceremonial thing , and executed in mere moments . Would you bear with me , Mr. Bonds ? Indulge an addled old pedagogue for just a moment ? " <p> " You say you want to perform a ceremony , Mr. Larken ? " It was odd how much frailer Pat 's voice sounded than Larken 's . The idling earthmover half-drowned him out with a surge in its engine 's rumble . <p> " A simple ceremony , Mr. Bonds . An offering , plainly and briefly made . " <p> " You want to do it ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-erase Pat 's words , his little laugh at the strangeness of his own question . <p> " This spot of earth , right here , is all I need . The god I 'm praying to is here , right underfoot of us . " <p> The man 's utter madness was out , it loomed before them now . But in that moment it was the others who seemed unreal to Marjorie . Hugging her tree , melted by her terror out of any shape to act , she found Pat and the operator , the Jeep and the dozer , all too garish to be real - like bright balloons , all of them , taut , weightless , flimsy . Pat , helpless before this perfect nonsense , made a gesture of permission that was oddly priestlike - an opening-out of hands and arms . <p> Larken unslung a small knapsack , and cupped it in both hands before him , tilted his head back slightly , his eyes searching inwardly . Marjorie , stuck like lichen to that trunk , a limbless shape , a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it - Marjorie understood that the strange man was searching for the right words . Understood too now that it was the rumbling of that dozer 's engine that was awakening the earthquake underfoot . <p> He chose his words . " I have been your faithful seeker , your faithful servant , forsaking all others ! All others ! I make you now your commanded offering . Open to me now the gates of eternity ! " <p> He opened the knapsack , lifted it high , and sent its contents tumbling down through the silver air - two pale spheroids , two human heads , jouncing so vividly on the ground , their short-barbered hair looking surreally neat against the red dirt , their black-scabbed stumps glossy as lacquer . <p> Their impact with the earth set off the earthquake . There was a shrieking of metal as the backhoe flung its great arm in the air , a gesture galvanic as some colossal scorpion 's . The whole machine came apart with the fury of this straightening , the steel sinews spraying asunder in red shards , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatchling of tarry muscle clotted on long bone . Two crimson eyes blazed above its black snout , as its crooked paw , prehensile , seized Pat and the operator together . The men cried out , their bones breaking in the grip that lifted them up to the mad red moons of eyes , lifted them higher still , and flung them powerfully at the earth . They struck the ground , impossibly flattened by the impact , transformed , in fact , to roadkill , to sprawling husks of human beings , bony silhouettes postured as if they were running full tilt toward the core of the planet . <p> " Thank you ! Thank you ! Oh thank you ! " Larken 's gratitude sounded as wild as grief - his wail brought the god 's paw down to him in turn . In turn he was seized up and lofted high , and was held aloft a moment while the god 's eyes bathed him in their scarlet radiation . <p> And Marjorie , who had not guessed that she had voice left in her , screamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monster was no longer earth , but was a ragged-edged chasm of blackness , an infinite cauldron of darkness and stars . <p> The brute god held Larken high above this abyss . She could make out his face clearly above the crooked claw that gripped him - he was weeping with wonder and awe . <p> The god flung him down . His arms windmilling , down Larken plunged . The god gave one furious snort that wafted like roadkill through the morning air , and leapt after his acolyte , dwindling down toward the starfields . <p> The earth closed over them , and Marjorie hugged the tree , quivering , staring at that resealed earth . The soil seemed sneakily transparent , thinly buried stars trying to burn through it like diamond drill bits . The planet felt hollow underfoot , and the great tree sustaining her seemed to feel it , too . They huddled together , feeling the ground resonate under them , like the deck of a ship on a rolling sea . <p> She straightened and started forward , a starship traveler negotiating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... there were the twisted shards of bright red metal ... right here was where it had happened , the red dirt solid now , supporting her , supporting the black-stumped heads like thrown dice , their dulled snake-eyes aimed askew of one another , looking in different directions for the sane Earth they had known , she had known .... <p> The sane world lay that way , did n't it ? Down this narrow country road she could find her way back to freeway on-ramps that channeled predictably to shopping malls that sold fancy underwear and barrels of jellybeans , to Humanity Inc. with its computers and telephones and case-files full of muddled souls with painful childhoods and histories of run-ins with the law .... <p> But how could the road lead there from such a starting point as this , here on the margin of the asphalt ? These two sprawled human husks ? She gazed on the distorted profile of Pat Bonds , crushed bone clad in sunbaked parchment . Older than Egypt he looked , the eye a glazed clot of mucus , a canted half-grin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , yet so expressive . He stared with outrage , with furious protest , at eternity . <p> Go back down this road . Take the first step , and the next will follow ... see ? Now the next . You 're doing fine , Marjorie . Soon you 'll reach your car , your car will reach the city . Just keep moving . It 'll all come back to you .... <p> Sidebar
