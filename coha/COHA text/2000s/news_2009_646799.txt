COLLEGEVILLE , Minn.  --  Ask John Gagliardi why he has spent almost his entire adult life at Saint John 's University , and the 82-year-old football coach gives a mischievous smile . <p> " I think it must be the water , " he says of the 1,900-student Catholic men 's school in the empty spaces of west-central Minnesota . " That or the weather . " <p> Gagliardi came to Saint John 's in 1953 and has won more games  --  468  --  than anyone in any division in college football history . He has won two NCAA Division III national championships and two NAIA titles and in 2006 became the first active coach inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame . The Division III player of the year award carries his name . <p> But while Gagliardi is the most decorated of SJU 's coaches , his longevity is the rule and not the exception when it comes to athletic tenure . Coaches tend to come to Collegeville and never leave . <p> *Basketball coach Jim Smith ended his 45th season Monday with 699 career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipping and breaking his leg Feb. 7 . <p> *Jerry Haugen began his 32nd year as baseball coach Wednesday and could reach 600 victories before season 's end . <p> *Soccer coach Pat Haws has won 336 matches in 31 seasons . <p> *Track/cross country coach Tim Miles has been on the job for 30 years , working with the indoor and outdoor teams . <p> Beyond these five , Bob Alpers has coached the Johnnies golf team for 17 years and will be going for a third consecutive NCAA title in May . John Harrington , a member of the 1980 U.S. Olympic gold-medal hockey team , spent 15 years at Saint John 's before leaving last year to coach a pro team in Switzerland . Of the university 's 13 coaches , 10 have the longest tenure in their sport in the nine-school Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference . <p> Smith was an assistant at Marquette when he was recruited to become head coach at Saint John 's in 1964 , arriving on campus by train and taxi . <p> " I thought anything west of Milwaukee was wilderness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I visited I thought Saint John 's was a unique place . " <p> As Smith and his wife , Adrienne , considered Saint John 's offer , they had a lot more reasons to say no than yes . They came anyway , raised seven children in nearby St. Cloud and have never given a thought to leaving . <p> " There was just something about this place that made it unlike anywhere I had ever been , " Smith says . " I think it all goes back to the monastery and the values and the ethics of the monks that are all around you . It is and always has been an inspiring place to work . " <p> Monks make difference <p> Saint John 's University is Collegeville , Minn . There is no surrounding town , no accompanying infrastructure of restaurants , apartments and shops . There is simply the school , which sits 70 miles northwest of Minneapolis and 150 miles southeast of Fargo , N.D. St. Cloud is 10 miles east . <p> The campus lies just off Interstate 94 on County Road 159 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is visible from the highway . Bordered on two sides by lakes and surrounded by 2,700 acres of woodlands , the school has prospered since being founded in 1857 by five Benedictine monks . <p> Saint John 's sister school , the College of Saint Benedict , is 6 miles away in the town of St. Joseph 's . The schools have separate administrations , ministries and athletic departments but share academics . Students take courses on both campuses , and classes are co-educational . <p> The university has grown around the Benedictine monastery that endures as a central part of the school and is home to the 150 monks of Saint John 's Abbey . These Benedictine fathers and brothers have taken vows of stability , poverty , chastity and obedience and will live out their lives on the campus and be buried in the campus cemetery . <p> The monks serve as academic instructors , administrators and craftsmen . One lives on every floor of every dormitory as an adviser . <p> " Somewhere on this campus there is always a light on and a door unlocked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director from 2003 to 2006 and now is the headmaster of Saint John 's prep school . " I think that resonates with men like John Gagliardi . " <p> The number of monks is dwindling  --  there were more than 400 in the 1950s  --  but their presence and the continuity they provide help explain the strong generational ties reflected in the school 's enrollment . <p> Roughly 45% of Saint John 's students have followed parents , siblings or other relatives to SJU or CSB , according to Saint John 's admissions office . The 2003 national championship football team featured 18 players whose fathers played at Saint John 's , three of them on the 1976 title team . <p> Coaches at the Division III level often wear more than one hat , serving as assistants in other sports or holding administrative posts . Saint John 's takes that to another level . <p> At one time , Gagliardi also was the track and hockey coach and athletics director . Smith served two stretches as AD , and Haugen , a 1976 graduate , began as the hockey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball assistant and still doubles as football 's defensive coordinator . <p> Even coaches who retire find some way to remain . John Elton , a 1980 graduate , was inducted into the NCAA Division III wrestling coaches hall of fame in 2007 . Elton , who is a master gardener , stepped down in 2004 after 23 seasons to become Saint John 's landscape manager . <p> " I 've been here 30 years , and I 'm still talking with brothers who taught me as a student and running into sons of men I coached , " Elton says . " The longevity of Saint John 's is n't just athletics , you see it in all aspects of this community . <p> " This is a place you almost have to experience to understand . It 's like coming home ; it 's a feeling you 're part of something good and that what you 're doing makes a difference . " <p> Community truly close <p> More than one-third of Saint John 's students participate in intercollegiate athletics ; that number jumps to 90% when club sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have its own hockey rink  --  it plays home games at St. Cloud State  --  its athletic facilities are first-rate , especially in football . <p> Surrounded by trees and nestled in a natural bowl , Clemens Stadium becomes its own little city on football Saturdays . Although there are seats for 7,500 , standing room routinely lifts crowds to 13,000 , attracting students , alumni and fans from a 100-mile radius . Despite a stretch of rotten weather on game days last fall , Saint John 's led the 231 schools that play Division III football in attendance ( 7,694 a game ) for the 12th time in the past 16 years . <p> This atmosphere was one of the reasons Brett Saladin set aside opportunities to play football and baseball at the Division I level and came to Saint John 's , where he finished this past fall as one of the most productive tight ends in school history . <p> " I had zero ties to Saint John 's before coming here , but I knew from the day I visited that this was my place , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " People talk about community wherever you go and how close people are , but it 's really true here . " <p> Almost 90% of the SJU and CSB student bodies graduate in four years , and 98% receive some sort of financial aid to help cover the $36,000 annual cost for room , board and tuition ( Division III schools do not award athletic scholarships ) . <p> Senior hockey player Lance Wheeler was impressed by the way coaches made room for academics . " At Saint John 's , you are a student-athlete in that order , " he says . <p> Wheeler and his twin , Vince , joined retired priest Bryan Hayes every day for lunch in the campus dining hall last summer while taking classes . <p> " We had discussions on everything from the presidential race to his life in the monastery to man 's place in the world , " says Vince , who is not Catholic .

" <p> You experience people such as soccer coach Haws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year before his father , the Johnnies wrestling coach , died of a heart attack while guiding SJU at the national Catholic championships . He returned to campus that year to start the SJU swim program and added soccer duties in 1978 , coaching both programs for 20 years . <p> " I met my wife when I was a student here , and my son is now my assistant , " Haws says . " He graduated in 1999 , almost 100 years to the day after my wife 's grandfather graduated . <p> " This is more than our home ; it 's our life . I do n't care what sport I 'm coaching , this is where I want to be . My wife and I bought a plot ( in the Saint John 's cemetery ) . I 'm here for eternity .
