<p> Candidate 's family includes more than just developers <p> We were , of course , disappointed that the AJC chose not to endorse Jodie Rosser ( " Our Opinions ; Primary elections endorsements ; Some changes due for Gwinnett , " June 29 , AJC Editorial ) . However , we appreciate that you recognized her as a solid , significant contender in the Gwinnett County Commission District 4 race . <p> The only detail we 'd like to address is that you referred to her family as developers . Although her father , J.C . White , and her brother , Scott , are in the development business , that does n't begin to describe Jodie 's family . Her twin sister , Meg Baxter , and her husband , are both medical doctors doing their residency in West Virginia . Her other sister , Jori Harmon , is a stay-at-home mom and former teacher . Jori 's husband is a salesman for a security company . Scott 's wife is a CPA , and Jodie 's husband , Marcus , has a business management background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of 55 when Jodie was only 20 , graduated from Florida State University and then studied to be a dental hygenist at Tulane University . <p> Should Jodie be elected , she would have far more to draw on than just ties to the construction industry . <p> In addition , it should be repeated that Jodie Rosser and her father have very strong differences of opinion about development issues . Most importantly , she backs impact fees for developers , and he definitely does not . <p> LORETTA PARAGUASSU , press secretary for Jodie Rosser <p> Sweat equity builds better communities <p> I found the blog regarding the South Gwinnett Athletic Association park especially interesting ( " Park 's step forward feels like community loss , " June 30 , AJC Gwinnett Opinions ) . <p> I have been a youth football , basketball and soccer coach since our kids were playing T-ball . My wife has been my partner in crime as a team mom and everything else . The oldest two children are now in college . One is married , and we are now grandparents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities because they desire the same education and quality of life for their family . However , what many do n't realize is purchasing that piece of real estate alone does not create the education and quality of life one desires . <p> Great communities have an untold number of great parents and caring adults who sacrifice their personal time to invest in children and communities . For us , we never felt like we were being cheated . Our volunteering at schools , and involvement in youth sports programs allowed us to meet wonderful families , while ensuring we were making a contribution to the community 's investment in education and our family 's quality of life . <p> I strongly admire the families in Snellville who worked hard to create wealth and invested that wealth in the community by building parks and programs that all families could enjoy . Now , we have a passing of the guard . <p> I believe it is a positive strategic step for the county to assume the res-ponsibility for the park . The investment of SPLOST special purpose local option sales tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> However , one thing SPLOST can not do is force parents to invest time in their children and community by volunteering at school and youth sports programs . <p> As a coach I have mostly found parents to be supportive . They often recognize you are sacrificing personal time to invest in their children . <p> I recall when our kids started playing soccer at Harmony Grove . I never played the game but was willing to learn and help as an assistant coach . Well , as life would happen . . . the head coach had a job change and could not coach the team.We discussed disbanding , but the parents asked me to step up and become head coach . <p> Though I do not recall the diversity of the team , I think it 's safe to say we were one of the only minority families . Nevertheless , the parents and kids rallied behind me . <p> I wish the story had a " Rocky " - like ending . Unfortunately , we lost every game , but the kids improved tremendously . It turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had . The parents and kids remained supportive throughout the season and asked me to coach the team again . Wow . <p> It 's community when everyone has some sweat equity in the game of life in preparing our children to be productive citizens . <p> THE REV . JOHN STEWART , Snellville <p> Immigrants ' views of U.S. were inspiring , disturbing <p> I hope that those who believe that multiculturalism trumps all and think that the American " melting pot " is irrelevant and unneeded closely read " Immigrants fervor for Fourth ? It all depends ... " ( July 4 , AJC Gwinnett News ) . <p> I hope even more that patriotic Americans read and understand the viewpoints expressed in this article . <p> Several immigrant views ranged from feeling more " American than anything else " to a downright " I really do n't care " from a 20-year-old attending Georgia Tech but who expects to spend the rest of her life in the United States . <p> One 33-year-old woman from India has spent more than 26 years in our country but " has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I simply loved the reply of one former Dominican who said " it was a great feeling to be here , " and " a lot of people have sacrificed for what we have in this country . " That 's the kind of legal immigrant we really need . <p> I love those legal immigrants who come to our great country and embrace our nation and our freedoms and strive to be good Americans first and foremost . I certainly expect them to also want to preserve their heritage , but I also expect them to embrace our ideals , respect our customs and traditions and to try to become Americans . <p> Remarks like " I really do n't care " are disgusting to me , and I resent those who regard immigrating to our country to be simply a business opportunity . <p> I would suggest to those who have no desire to become Americanized to return to their home country . Far too many of my family and friends suffered and died to make the United States the great free country that it is for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideals . <p> I would say to all immigrants to either love and respect this nation or at least make the attempt , or leave it ! <p> ERNEST WADE , Loganville <p> Responses to " If she were a he , maybe Pinder would be A-OK , " June 29 , AJC Gwinnett News : <p> Pinder will be missed <p> Today 's culture and the politically correct mess have been the downfall of other great leaders . <p> Jo Ann Pinder got the shaft for doing her job , and doing the job without kissing up to the religious group of home school mommies or the board members . <p> ... Anyway , she is gone and she will be missed by people like me who did not know her personally but did receive the benefits of her good , hard-nosed management style of the Gwinnett County Public Library system . <p> Good luck , Ms. Pinder . <p> DAVE OLIVER , Hoschton <p> Taxpayers deserve an explanation <p> I was distressed to read of library chief Jo Ann Pinder 's recent termination . In Rick Badie 's column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrimination . That 's certainly a plausible guess , and it would be troubling to discover this as fact . <p> But what troubles me more is the reality that you and I are forced to guess why she was fired because those in a position to do so have n't yet given their reasons . <p> Why are n't the citizens of this county being told what prompted Ms. Pinder 's dismissal ? I find this complete lack of transparency about an action that will cost local taxpayers a significant amount of money truly problematic . <p> The library board owes the public it serves an explanation for its decision . ( Surely it was about more than the refusal of a hug ! ) <p> I would like to know the facts of the matter so I can decide for myself whether the board made a good decision or not . We should not be left waiting and wondering any longer . <p> ELLIE HAROLD , Norcross <p> Connections are what create true neighborhoods <p> I read with interest the column on subdivisions vs. neighborhoods ( " Residents have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AJC Gwinnett Opinions ) . I think the distinctions between them have blurred in recent years . <p> The advantages we felt from moving to a subdivision  --  homeowner 's association , swim and tennis  --  have now gone by the wayside . <p> I grew up in a neighborhood in DeKalb County in the ' 60s . I remember many covered-dish dinners , lots of playmates and feeling I could knock on any door for a glass of water or to use the bathroom during the long summer play hours . Recently , I reminisced with the mother of one of those playmates about how often we camped out in the cow pasture behind the Methodist Children 's Home in Decatur  --  the pasture is now condominiums . <p> When my husband and I moved to Gwinnett County 10 years ago , we chose a subdivision , but a small one  --  40 homes . At that time we celebrated each holiday with our neighbors with covered-dish suppers , luminarias on Christmas Eve , Halloween parades and welcome baskets for new move-ins . We 've seen some homes sell two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gone missing with the turnovers . <p> We no longer know all of our neighbors , and our neighborhood pool and tennis club that served several subdivisions with non-mandatory membership was sold this year because of lack of members . While we still wave when passing , I do n't know all my neighbors ' names . <p> I think the mix of ages can affect our " neighborliness . " Most of the new residents do not have children : older couples downsizing or young childless couples . I do n't know where the children play who are here , but I do n't see them in the streets as my son played when he was younger . Perhaps they 're in day care , camps or those endless lessons parents feel their children need these days . <p> I had n't thought about how I missed those neighborhood get-togethers until I read Susan Gast 's column . But I wonder if this deterioration of " neighborliness " may be due to our increasing isolation due to technology and convenience . I e-mail now rather than pick up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much quicker than calling a neighbor for a cup of sugar . <p> My community now comes from my church and the various organizations I belong to  --  tennis , book club , parent organizations . So in that sense , my neighborhood has broadened to include those with whom I have a common interest . Neighborhood or subdivision . . . I think it just depends on whether you can connect or not . . . and whether you 'll make the effort to keep connected . <p> NELDA COATS , Stone Mountain Photo : VINO WONG / staffJo Ann Pinder was recently fired as executive director by the Gwinnett County Public Library Board of Trustees . The board gave no cause for the dismissal and has since refused to offer one .
