<p> GOOD NEIGHBORS : World-class zoo director a blessing for Atlanta <p> Terry Maple , director and CEO of Zoo Atlanta , made an eloquent plea to save the Sumatran tiger on the same day that Bahagia , the female Sumatran cub born at the Zoo in November , made her debut to adoring visitors . Maple 's commitment and the Zoo 's popularity remind me that our zoo man is one of the best things about Atlanta . <p> When I came to the city in 1969 , the Atlanta zoo was a slum prison for sick and aging animals , rated one of the worst 10 in the United States . With the arrival of Maple , the zoo expanded its vision and the physical size , and in 10 years had become on the the 10 best such establishments , known for excellence in education and the conservation of rare and endangered species . <p> Terry Maple is a rare species , too . He is a great guy who works hard and is quietly building an Atlanta institution of great benefit to animals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Atlanta , we have found it in our zoo director . MAXINE ROCK , Atlanta <p> Hospitalized couple grateful for friend 's thoughtfulness <p> My husband and I were recently at Parris Island , S.C. , to see a son graduate from the U.S. Marines boot camp . While there , I had a heart attack and was taken to a Charleston hospital for bypass surgery . While I was in the hospital , my husband , Wendell , had a mild stroke and was hospitalized also . <p> Tootsie Callaway , a longtime friend in our Morrow United Methodist Church , called a dear Charlestonian friend of hers , and she asked her to see both of us at Trident Medical Center there . <p> Of course , she did come to visit us and called to check in on us . <p> I was touched by Tootsie 's thoughtfulness , and we truly appreciated it . This was certainly going the second mile by both of them . <p> We are fine now , thanks to good doctors , family and friends . SHIRLEY WATTERSON , Morrow <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during the afternoon rush hour , I experienced my worst nightmare . I was traveling west on I-285 in the next to center lane when my van just died . With the electrical system out , I could n't even activate my hazard signals , and I was without my cell phone . For about 15 minutes , cars and trucks whizzed by me on all sides , with wrecks nearly occuring as drivers tried to move from behind me into adjacent lanes . <p> Suddenly , a knight in shining armor appeared in the form of a handsome young man in a shiny red pickup truck . Oblivious to the traffic he was blocking in his lane , he pulled beside me on the driver 's side , asked a few questions and calmly started to instruct me . <p> " We are in a gradual descent here , " he shouted . " Put your gear in neutral and coast . I will be right behind you with my hazard lights on . " This way , we crossed five lanes of heavy traffic and reached the shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cables , started my van and followed me to my exit . <p> Not only would he not accept money , he would n't even tell me his name . Finally , as he pulled away he said , " My name is Bob . " <p> Wherever you are , Bob , thanks a million . You were a lifesaver ! JAN COLLINS , Sandy Springs <p> The Journal-Constitution reserves this space each week to give readers an opportunity to say thank you for the kind deeds they have recently seen or experienced . <p> Veterans have earned their ' free educations ' <p> If I were a veteran , I would salute a recent letter-writer who wrote of his experience of training in Vietnam ( " Pilot got education in Vietnam duty , " April 7 ) . He paid dearly for his education and has earned his commercial pilot 's license . <p> My husband also was " educated " with taxpayer dollars ; he was lucky and worked on airplanes instead of in them and thus was spared a tour of Vietnam . Because of his education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a major corporation 27 years ago , and he is still a loyal employee . <p> Many veterans use their so-called free education on their resume in civilian employment ; look at a federal or post office employment form and you will see a " priority consideration " for veterans . DEE WEISBARTH , Marietta <p> Financial education may ease heavy debt loads <p> Concerning Alan Greenspan 's suggestion that all students should have financial education : I hope that his suggestion will be reiterated in editorials and that educators everywhere will heed the advice . <p> Having seen so many young people ruin their credit with the first credit card , which is not only readily available to them but is actually shoved on them by many indiscriminate sources , I see this as an obvious contributor to high interest rates for prudent consumers , and as a certainty to inhibit the ambitions and potential successes of the less prudent , naive , first-time credit card users . AGNES COWAN , Atlanta <p> What would donor say about use of MLK image ? <p> Concerning the commercialization of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legacy , there is one opinion we shall never hear but which would be priceless : What would Dorothy Parker , who bequeathed the bulk of her estate to the civil rights leader , say ? <p> KHALEEL WAHEED , Tucker <p> Car ads on television wrong to focus on speed <p> If speed kills , why does the auto industry feature speed in most of its TV ads ? The commercials frequently show computer-enhanced situations that are actually impossible , such as high-speed driving on a curving mountain road or passing another car to avoid a head-on collision . <p> A professional driver may be able to perform such a feat , but not a new , inexperienced teen . Teenagers are very impressionable and trusting . They tend to believe what they see . It would be great if the auto industry would assume responsibility by selling features of a car other than speed . <p> L.L. BECHLER , Marietta <p> Chinese not innocent <p> Did I miss something in all of the media attention this China fiasco is getting ? When did the Chinese pilot become an innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconnaissance planes in international waters . One decided to imitate the Japanese kamikaze pilots from World War II and the United States is to blame for this ? Is that not considered an act of aggression ? MELISSA GALLOWAY , Alpharetta <p> Latin American natives deserve reparations first <p> I , for one , am ready to discuss reparations for slavery at such time as Spain also is ready to discuss reparations due Mexican tribes , South American Indians and others that Spain has imposed itself on . The Spanish stole everything of value from the indigenous people of Mexico . They took their women and children and made slaves of the male family members . They sent their military and their church to plunder , steal and rob and imposed the Spanish language . Is it any wonder that Mexicans come to the United States ? RAY CUNNINGHAM , Decatur <p> ZELL MILLER : Zell keeping campaign vow to serve Georgians <p> The reason Sen. Zell Miller votes the way he does is because he is not a slave to the party lines . When he ran for the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would not serve just the Democrats , but all Georgians . <p> He has so far kept that promise . And I , for one , think it is refreshing for a politician to keep his campaign promises . I think Zell is also very aware that Georgians voted overwhelmingly for President Bush . <p> Sen. Max Cleland should also be thinking about this , or he will be known as ex-Sen . Cleland . CAROLYN WILDER , Acworth <p> Zig Zag , go back to cabin <p> Thanks to the people who question Zell Miller since his election to the Senate . Zig was a Democrat . Every single thing in his political life came from the Democrats . Zag used our very good Gov . Roy Barnes to get where he is . <p> I ask the fair , moderate Republicans : Do you trust Zell Miller ? <p> Zell , go back to the cabin . PAT DOZIER , Buford <p> No voice for black voters <p> Sen. Zell Miller did not represent black voters when he supported John Ashcroft for attorney general . By Miller 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has for black people . <p> I was stupid enough to vote for this man , but never again .
