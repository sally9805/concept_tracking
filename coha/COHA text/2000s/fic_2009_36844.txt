December 1947 <p> A CIRCLE OF LAMPLIGHT in the otherwise darkened office cast a cool glow on the letter as I wrote . The hum of cars whizzing through the night , far below my second-story office window , was the only noise I could make out . Soon waking sounds would echo through the streets of New York , but at four a.m. , it was as quiet as the city ever got . I took a deep breath , picked up my pen , and signed the letter . <p> My name is Allie Fortune , and I 'm the only female P.I . - private investigator-in New York City . I was probably also the only P.I . awake and working at this time of night . Most people would be in bed enjoying the last few hours of rest before dawn . Instead of sleeping I 'd spent the quiet , still hours writing a letter , trying to find someone , searching out an investigative lead . But this time it was n't on behalf of a client . Tonight it was my missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rubeneski . Up until three months ago , he 'd been dead . At least that was the official statement from the War Department : missing in action and presumed dead . But I 'd never presumed . Up until three months ago , I 'd had no real reason not to believe the claims , but something inside me had never accepted them . And so I 'd searched and written letter after letter and investigated until I 'd finally found out the truth . Sources inside the FBI had confirmed it . David was alive . <p> Unfortunately the information I 'd bartered for was incomplete ; someone knew where he was , but I did n't . <p> As impossible as the task of locating him seemed , I was n't about to stop looking . And so I wrote inquiries and investigated . He was alive . But I was n't much closer to finding him . <p> I finished the letter and sealed the envelope , then went over to the window and peered through the blind slats at the empty street below . A small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of life . <p> Only a few more hours until dawn . I looked over at the long leather couch where often I caught an hour or so of sleep . I knew without even bothering to try that sleep was n't going to come . I 'd recently visited the doctor to discuss my sleep problem . He 'd told me it was insomnia and that there was no cure . He 'd recommended sedatives ; I 'd refused . <p> I sighed and went over to the record player in the corner and turned on the music . I rarely let myself listen to it , but once in a long while I sank into the song that played the last time I 'd seen him . As notes fluttered out and filled the room , I leaned against the wall . Unbidden , the memory of a smoky dance hall , the heat of hundreds of bodies , and the feel of David 's jacket against my cheek returned . For a brief second I felt dizzy , as though I were really dancing with him again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory , to fade the edges so they were n't so sharp and raw . I reached out and jerked the needle off , not caring that I may have scratched the disc , just needing it to stop . The sudden silence was jarring . <p> I moved back to the desk and sat down , looking for anything to distract me from my thoughts . The worst part of insomnia was the tiredness that pervaded the waking hours , but a close second was the sheer boredom of being awake when no one else was . There was only so much paperwork I could do in the middle of the night . Sometimes I longed for nothing more than another voice in the darkness , someone to talk to . <p> I pushed a few files to the side and laid my head on the desk . It would n't make up for the lost hours of sleep tonight , but a few minutes of resting my eyes would help nonetheless . I let my eyes drift shut . Blocking all further thoughts of David , I just let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foggy brain . I lifted my head from the desk with a sigh , checked my watch , and was surprised to see that it was a few minutes past six . I must have dozed for more than an hour . Shaking my head and trying to brush off the fog of fatigue , I heard the phone ring again . <p> Reaching for the receiver I cleared my throat before lifting it to my ear . " Allie Fortune here . " My voice had no telltale sleep huskiness , but the person on the other end hesitated anyway . <p> " Allie ? " Jack sounded unsure . <p> " Yeah , it 's me . How are you , Jack ? " I rubbed at my face with my free hand to wake myself up . I had n't spoken to Jack in a few weeks , but I 'd assumed that the FBI was keeping him running . Still it was great to hear his voice . <p> " Busy , but not bad . " There was a hesitation in his voice . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run by you . Get your opinion on . " <p> I could tell he did n't want to talk about it over the phone . " Sure , do you want to come by the office sometime today ? I 've got a lot going on here , but I 'm free until about eight o'clock this morning . " <p> " I 'm a bit tied up at the moment . I ca n't get off work until this evening . Can we meet then ? " <p> Something in his manner put me on full alert . " Today is Wednesday . You know what that means . " <p> Jack groaned . " Dinner with your parents . " He sighed . " This is important . Could you see if I can be your date for dinner tonight ? I know it 's last minute , but I really need to talk to you . " <p> Asking me to call my mother and change plans for tonight was huge . For almost anyone else in the world I would have refused flat out . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it was n't important . <p> " Absolutely . " <p> A sigh of relief whispered on the other end of the line . " Supper is at six-thirty , right ? " <p> " On the dot . " <p> " Can I meet you there ? I 'm going to have to race to make it as it is . " <p> " Just do n't tell my mother . She 'd lecture you all night on the proper way to treat a lady . " <p> He laughed . " So would mine , but this is urgent . " <p> The man was making me very curious . " Sure . I 'll meet you in the driveway at 6:25 but if you 're not there by then , I 'm going in without you . I wo n't arrive late , not even for you , Jack . " I laughed and heard it echoed from the other side of the line . <p> " Fair enough ; if I 'm late , I 'm on my own . " He was quiet for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Tonight . " <p> I set the receiver down , and it jiggled in its cradle for a moment . I had no idea what Jack wanted to talk to me about , but I knew one thing-it was going to be an interesting night . <p> Chapter Two I WAITED UNTIL nine a.m. before phoning my mother . I 'd spent every Wednesday for the past seven years at my parents ' house for supper . And every Wednesday , with only the rare exception , my mother had arranged for an eligible young man to be invited over for dinner as well . Seven years of awkward conversations and boring dates , and I 'd never shown a flicker of interest in a single one of them . My mother was nearly overcome with frustration at her thwarted attempts to get me married off . So this whole situation would have to be handled very carefully because I did n't want my mother taking my request to bring Jack to dinner as reason to break out the wedding invitations . <p> I knew for sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had arranged our initial introduction , mere hours before our work lives had intersected . <p> I dialed the phone , cranking out the familiar numbers with trepidation , running the thick black telephone cord through my fingers as I waited . <p> Three rings before she answered . " Morning , Mother . " <p> " Alexandra ? " She went silent for several seconds . I held my breath . " I hope you 're not phoning to cancel for this evening . " Her tone was a shade beyond clipped . <p> " No , Mother : I 'll be there . I was just wondering if we could adjust the plans slightly . " <p> " Change the plans ? How ? " She sighed loudly . " Are you going to be late ? Because it 's not like we ask a lot of you , one night a week is all , it 's the least you could do to show up at the prescribed time- " <p> " No . I wo n't be late , I 'd just like to bring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her tone was suspicious , but I could tell that I 'd piqued her curiosity . <p> " You remember Jack O'Connor . He 's the FBI agent that you introduced me to a few months ago . " I cringed . Once I 'd said it , I knew she was attaching all sorts of meaning to my request . I was going to have to head her off . <p> " Jack O'Connor ? " Silence stretched across the telephone line . I tapped my pencil against the desk , nerves making me restless . " That would be fine . I could change the plans we had for this evening to include him . " <p> " I want to make sure that you do n't get the wrong idea . " <p> " And what idea would that be , Alexandra ? You 've asked to bring a friend along to dinner . How can I get the wrong idea about that ? " <p> Her words did n't sway me . " Jack is just a friend . A colleague . We 've worked together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew I was repeating myself , but I could n't seem to keep quiet . I needed to make her understand . <p> " Goodness , Alexandra , there 's no need to get defensive . I understand . Mr. O'Connor is your friend . It 's not like I 'm going to have a string quartet playing Pachelbel 's Canon when you arrive . I 'm not about to hang up the phone and go unpack my grandmother 's wedding veil . He 's just a friend . I understand the concept . " <p> I closed my eyes and rubbed at my temple , feeling the beginnings of a headache . " I 'm sorry , Mother . I did n't mean to sound condescending . " <p> " Fine . Your apology is accepted . So we 'll see you at six-thirty ? " <p> I sighed . " Yes , I 'll be there at six-thirty . " Exactly the same time I 've arrived for the past seven years . I did n't speak that part aloud , but I had to bite my tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drained and just a little testy . After all that , , lack had better have something mighty important to discuss tonight . <p> My caseload had been full to overflowing for several months , but over the course of the day I got four of my open cases off the books and even got paid for one of them . I scratched the payment amount into my account book , filed the closed cases , and cleared off my desk . It felt good to get a few things put away and moved out of sight . At five o'clock I deposited a stack of file folders that contained open investigations onto the corner of my desk . It was work that had n't been completed and would need to be shoved on to the next day . Then I started the ten-block walk to my apartment . I had to grab a quick shower and change of clothes before setting out for supper at my parents ' . <p> The air outside was chilly , even for December in New York , and the sky was dark , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool damp air did n't bother me . The clack of my heels on the pavement as I strode through the darkening streets echoed in my ears . The glow of light from the streetlamps kept me from walking in the dark . I looked up and saw dark brick apartment buildings flanking the street , their square hulking forms broken by lighted apartment windows . Inside the warm , cozy apartments , families were probably going about the nightly rituals of supper and bedtime . The thought made me a little melancholy , knowing that my own apartment would be cold , dark , and empty . Suddenly glad I was going out , even to my parents ' house , I accelerated my pace . <p> I let myself into my apartment , shut the door , and removed my coat . I did n't even wait a moment before turning on the element under the teakettle . After the click , hiss , and snap of gas igniting , the blue flame made me feel warmer almost immediately . <p> I waited for the water to boil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shower while it steeped . In picking out clothes to wear , the main consideration was warmth , so I chose a charcoal wool suit , stockings , sensible shoes , and a black felted wool hat . I sipped my cup of tea and enjoyed the last few minutes of warmth before I had to go back out and face a cold subway ride and several hours of my mother 's company . <p> I walked as quickly as I could from the subway station to my parents ' house . Blowing on my gloved fingers , I 'd already decided that if Jack was n't outside when I got there I would go in without him . No way would I stand outside in the bitter cold longer than absolutely necessary . <p> My parents ' house was imposing by almost any standard . Right on the edge of Central Park , it was a stone behemoth with large windows , pillars , and formal landscaping , made even more forbidding by winter 's cold . The inside was just as impressive and just as cold . Carefully placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hum of tension , not relaxing or homey . <p> The sight of Jack leaning against one of the pillars both relieved my mind and brought a smile to my face . I was bundled up and freezing , and there he stood , jacket open , no gloves , leaning back , not a care in the world . Jack was a handsome man , with dark hair and eyes and a quick smile . He often looked as though he knew something everyone else did n't and was laughing just a little to himself . I always felt better when I was with him , from the first day I 'd met him . He had a solid sense of humor and the ability to laugh at himself . He also respected my skills as a detective , despite my gender , and that mow than anything told me all I needed to know about him . <p> When he spotted me he straightened up and headed down the drive toward me . <p> " Why did n't you tell me that you were going to have to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get you . " He glared at me as though annoyed . <p> " I did n't walk all the way here , just from the subway station . " <p> " Still , I would have picked you up if I 'd known . " <p> I stopped and turned to look at him , despite my burning desire to get inside . " Jack , I do n't have a car . How did you think I was going to get here ? " <p> He removed his hat and ran his fingers through his hair . He replaced the hat again and narrowed his eyes at me before answering . " I thought you would be sensible and take a taxi . " <p> " It costs ten times as much to take a taxi , and that 's if you can even find one in this weather . It was just easier . " <p> " You 're stubborn , you know that ? " <p> I felt my eyes narrow , and I crossed my arms . " 1 have n't seen or heard from you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing you can think of to say to me ? " <p> He grasped my elbow and guided me up the sidewalk to the door " Other than to tell you that you have n't changed a bit ? Yeah , that 's it . " He grinned as he said it , and I felt the old bite of friendship and rivalry between us , but I also saw a tightness around his eyes that worried me . <p> " You okay ? " I asked it quietly as he reached out and knocked . <p> " I 've had better weeks . " He stared straight ahead , another hint that something was wrong . I knew he had something to tell me , and I had n't known how serious it was , but I was getting the feeling that whatever it was , it was weighing heavily on Jack . <p> My thoughts were interrupted when the door opened with a blast of warm air I did n't wait , even for a second , just barreled straight in . Jack followed at a slightly more polite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind us without waiting for the maid who 'd answered the door to do it . <p> I turned to the maid , a young woman I 'd never seen before . She looked weary . Her pinned-up hair was slightly askew and there was a small stain on the front of her apron . From the looks of it , she 'd had a hard first day . I was pretty sure it was her first day here as I 'd seen the look she had in her eyes dozens of times on the faces of my mother 's new employees . She was a hard woman to work for , and it showed in her constantly changing household staff . <p> " I 'm Allie Fortune , and this is my friend Jack O'Connor We 're expected for dinner . " I smiled at the woman , but she did n't respond . She had a vacant look that told me she was beyond cheering at this point . All she wanted was to go home . <p> " Follow me . " We trailed the woman from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the drawing room . My mother sat on the high-backed , stiff Queen Anne settee , and my father sat in the only comfortable chair in the room . He read the newspaper while my mother sipped coffee out of a china cup in silence . <p> She was a very attractive woman , looking closer to her forties than her fifties . Her posture , her diction , and everything else about her seemed to scream breeding and tasteful wealth . Sometimes when I considered it , I felt sorry for her . What must it be like to have a daughter like me ? A female detective , unmarried , and well past marrying age . A daughter who had no interest in the things that were important to the mother . I did n't do it to spite her , or at least I had n't in years , but I could just never mold myself into whatever it was she wanted me to be . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>                @ @ @ @ @
