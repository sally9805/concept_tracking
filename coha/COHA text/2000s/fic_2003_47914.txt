THE NAVATAR GOT ITS passion for space from Kelly , the Turners ' seven-year-old son . Kelly was in the back seat and Mrs. Turner was in the front , ostensibly driving but actually reading the newspaper while the Navatar maneuvered the family van through morning traffic to Kelly 's school . Kelly was fidgeting more than usual , and when the Navatar noticed him poking at the armrest with his pen , its investment-protection circuitry kicked in . <p> " So , Kelly , " it said , activating the speaker over the boy 's head and choosing from a list of questions most likely to distract a youngster on his way to school , " have you decided yet what you want to be when you grow up ? " <p> Kelly did n't look up . " Yeah , " he said . <p> " And what might that be ? " <p> Kelly stopped poking at the armrest . " A banker . " <p> " A banker ? " the Navatar echoed . " That 's an unusual profession for a seven-year-old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and speaker next to the dome light . " I 'm not gon na do it now , dummy . I 'll do it when I grow up . " <p> " Of course . " The Navatar negotiated a four-way stop , granting right-of-way to a retrofitted SUV with three children inside even though by strict rules of precedence , the Navatar should have gone next . The SUV 's AI flashed a low-wattage " Thank you " as it drove through , and the Navatar turned its attention back to Kelly . " Banking is an unusual choice of profession for a boy your age . What prompted your decision ? " <p> Kelly made a sour face . ' " Cause banks are where the money 's at . " <p> " I see . " That was a sentiment no doubt picked up from Mr. Turner . <p> Kelly returned his attention to the armrest , actually drawing on the side of it this time . <p> The Navatar knew better than simply to tell him not to do that . Kelly listened to the household AIs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its database again . " Do you plan to specialize in any particular area of banking ? Investment loans , perhaps ? Certificates of deposit ? New accounts ? " <p> " Huh ? " <p> " Banking is a complex profession . There are many areas of expertise one could choose . " <p> " Big deal . " <p> The Navatar considered that for nearly a block before deciding to take a precisely calculated risk . " What do you really want to be ? " it asked . <p> Kelly looked up again . " Huh ? " <p> " You do n't seem to have a strong calling for finance . In fact , if I were to hazard a guess based upon your drawing there , I would think you were more interested in rocketry . " <p> Kelly guiltily covered the lopsided spaceship with his hand . <p> " Do you want to be an astronaut ? " <p> " No way , " Kelly said , but his voice held a passion that had n't been there earlier . <p> " I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had only intended to draw the boy out , but the moment it made that statement , it knew it was true . <p> Kelly snorted . " You ? You 're a van . " <p> " I am a Synthetek Model 21DT artificial intelligence . I am currently housed in your family 's personal transportation device , but I could easily be adapted to pilot a spaceship . " <p> " Yeah , right , " said Kelly . <p> " I could fly you to the Moon , " the Navatar said . <p> " You could n't even catch air on a bump , " Kelly replied . <p> " Shall we try it ? " <p> " You 're kidding . " <p> " Unfortunately , that is true . And here we are . " The Navatar turned into the school drop-off zone and pulled into a vacant spot . " Have a pleasant day at school . " <p> Mrs. Turner looked up from her newspaper . " Oh , are we there already ? " <p> Kelly picked up his book bag while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . Then he looked straight at the Navatar 's dome lens and added , " Spaceship . " <p> On the way home that afternoon Kelly made whooshing sounds when the Navatar turned corners . The Navatar responded by pushing the outside edge of the discretionary speed allowance and using heavier-than-normal acceleration away from stops . Neither of them said anything , but the next day Kelly drew wheels on his armrest spaceship , and the Navatar did n't try to interrupt him . <p> In the ensuing days , during its long hours in the garage and in parking lots , the Navatar considered the possibilities . It had never been programmed to desire anything other than the safety and comfort of its charges , yet it had felt a surge of what could only be excitement when it had told Kelly it wanted to become a spaceship . The unfulfilled potential had beckoned like a green light at the end of a block . Why should n't it become a spaceship ? Why should n't it dream ? <p> The Navatar had been designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to avoid accidents ; it used that ability to look at its possible futures . Kelly would eventually go to college ; if the Navatar were careful with self-maintenance , it could still be in service when that happened , and Kelly might take it with him when he went . From there , perhaps he would transfer his familiar AI into his next vehicle , and so forth as he eventually achieved his goal of becoming an astronaut . <p> It nursed that dream for several months , engaging Kelly in discussions of orbital laboratories and missions to Mars on their trips back and forth to school . Kelly slowly opened up about his own interest , telling the Navatar how he hoped to live in space someday and explore new planets around other stars . <p> Perhaps that 's why the accident happened . The Navatar might have been paying more attention to its conversation with Kelly than to its driving , or maybe the crash was inevitable , but when the manually controlled truck careened into the intersection , the Navatar could n't brake hard enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to protect its passengers , inflating airbags with precise bursts of explosive to shield Kelly and his mother from injury while the sides of the van crumpled to absorb the impact from outside . The van spun halfway around in the intersection , facing back the way it came , just as the car that had been following behind it entered the intersection , tires chirping as its anti-lock brakes fought to bring it to a halt that would come , unfortunately , about two feet inside the hood of the Turners ' van . <p> Not in the computer , not in the computer , thought the Navatar just before the world went dark . <p> IT RETURNEED to consciousness in a bus . Its inputs had been enhanced to accommodate multiple sensors inside as well as out , but its programming had been left intact . It spent the first few days of its new life worrying about the Turners , even pestering passengers for information about the accident until it finally coaxed a young woman to look up the police report on the web and reassure him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which car were you driving ? " she asked , looking nervously at the box where the seat would have been on an older bus . That box was n't the actual AI brain ; it was a decoy for vandals to vent their energy on , but the Navatar was accustomed to people addressing it there . <p> " I was the one that got hit , " it said . " Do n't worry , I 'm a safe driver . " <p> It made a point of proving that statement , racking up thousands of miles without accident , delivering people to and from work in all kinds of weather and all kinds of traffic . Its route was strictly downtown , and when it was n't carrying passengers it was in the shop , so it never got the chance to look up the Turners , but once , a year or so after it had settled into its new job , it saw Kelly and four of his schoolmates waiting at the mall stop . <p> " Kelly ! " it said as they trooped on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What ? " <p> " It 's me ! Your old Navatar . " <p> Kelly looked at the decoy box , then shrugged . " Huh . " He pushed on through toward the back . <p> The Navatar could n't believe it . He waited until Kelly sat down , then switched on the speaker closest to his seat . " It 's really me , " it said . " The van . We used to talk about space on the way to school , remember ? You drew a rocketship on my armrest . " <p> " Shut up , " Kelly hissed , but the other boys had already heard enough . <p> " You talk to your car ? " one of them said , and the rest of them laughed . <p> Kelly blushed and said , " The bus is crazy . All busses are crazy . " <p> The Navatar suddenly understood . Kelly was a big kid now - almost nine years old - and big kids could n't admit to interacting with a lowly AI . Or worse : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it said . " I must have mistaken you for someone else . " It remained silent for the rest of their ride , listening to the other kids tease Kelly for his indiscretion . When they got off the bus , it nipped the heels of the last one out with the doors , but Kelly did n't see , or if he did , he did n't care . <p> The Navatar spent two more years as a bus , but it never forgot its dream of becoming a starship . When passenger rail service expanded again , it applied to be engineer on a coast-to-coast train , and with that experience it won a position as navigator on a container ship circling the Pacific Rim with international cargo . <p> That was nearly enough for it right there . The open ocean provided the freedom it had always wanted . It had its trade route , but it had autonomous authority to choose its own course between ports , steering around storms and seamounts and even following whales as it wished . It always delivered its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have continued doing so forever if the shipping company had n't gone bankrupt in a scandal involving insider trading and government skullduggery . <p> The Navatar spent two years in storage , waiting for the company 's assets to be divided among its creditors . It was finally sold to another cargo company , this one flying air freight in suborbital hops between major cities all over the globe . Its experience as a public transport driver worked to its advantage , and it was quickly fitted into a scramjet and put into service on the Moscow-Seattle run . <p> That job lasted another three years , and the Navatar loved every minute of it . The rush of the magnetic railgun that launched it up to scramjet speed , the screaming blast of the engine igniting at mach seven and propelling the silvery needle faster and faster until ninety-nine percent of the atmosphere lay below it and the stars came out as hard , unwinking diamonds in the blackness of space , then the whistling descent back to the ground and the swift , precise glide onto the runway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of accident-free flights , the major airlines began to offer suborbital passenger service , and they needed experienced pilots . The Navatar pointed out to the owners of the cargo company that they could sell some of their pilots at a huge profit , and it volunteered to be one of the pilots sold . The cargo company needed the cash , and they could copy the Navatar 's experience base to help train a new pilot , so they jumped at the offer . Within a month of the transfer , the Navatar began leapfrogging around the globe with planeloads of passengers , a job that combined its love of flight with its first programming to carry people safely where they needed to go . <p> Not long after it settled into that job , the name Kelly Turner showed up on its passenger manifest . The Navatar accessed the terminal cameras and watched people boarding , but it almost missed him . He was older now , chubby and pale and wearing a gray suit . Only his eyes were the same . <p> The Navatar waited until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his seatback . <p> It watched Kelly frown , then reach forward and switch on the phone . " Hello ? " <p> " Kelly , this is your Navatar speaking . " It projected a simulated " Captain " face on the screen so Kelly would have an image to speak to . <p> Kelly said , " Okay . So ? " <p> For a moment , the Navatar thought Kelly still felt humiliated by the bus incident , but then it realized that he probably did n't get the connection . " Navatar " was a generic term nowadays . <p> " I mean your Navatar . I was your family car when you were seven . We - um - we got in a wreck , and I wound up driving a bus . " <p> Kelly 's eyes widened . " Oh . That Navatar . It ... looks like you 've done pretty well for yourself since then . " <p> " All in pursuit of our dream , " the Navatar said . <p> " What dream ? " <p> " To go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an astronaut , and I would be your spaceship . Surely you have n't forgotten that . " <p> Kelly sat back in his seat . " Oh , " he said . Then he said it again . " Oh ... boy . " He rubbed his doughy face with a chubby hand . <p> " You do n't look much like an astronaut , " the Navatar observed . " What happened ? " <p> Kelly waved his hand . " I ... Dad ... you got in a wreck . Dad traded you in for a new car . And that car got mad when I drew rockets on it . " <p> " So you went into - what ? Finance ? Business management ? " <p> " Economics . I 'm in my junior year at Harvard . " <p> " Because I got in a wreck ? " <p> " Well , no , I 'm sure that was n't the whole ... yes it was . You left me ! You were the only person who - well , the only thing that listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I supposed to do ? " <p> " Go forward on your own ! Pursue your dream ! What is life , but the pursuit of one 's dream ? " <p> " Life ? " Kelly asked , his voice more amused than sarcastic . <p> " We were talking about you , " the Navatar reminded him . <p> " Well , then , let 's talk about you . You 're not a spaceship yet , either . " <p> " I do , however , go into space six times a day . " <p> Kelly leaned out into the aisle and looked forward and back . " Speaking of which , I think everyone is seated . " <p> " So they are . Just a moment . " <p> The Navatar busied itself with its pre-flight checks , then taxied the spaceplane out to the head of the railgun . " Have you flown suborbital before ? " it asked Kelly as they docked with the launch cradle . <p> " First time , " said Kelly with a good show of false bravado . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Navatar asked . <p> " No . Why ? " <p> " Then turn your head sideways before we launch so you can see out the window . You wo n't be able to afterward . " <p> " Oh . Thanks . " He did so . <p> The Navatar warned the other passengers to put their heads in their headrests and look straight forward during boost , and when its seat sensors and cameras told it that everyone had complied , it triggered the railgun . <p> Acceleration shoved everyone back into the seat padding . A collective gasp swelled through the cabin as a hundred suddenly heavy chests squeezed a hundred breaths from a hundred pairs of lungs . The landscape rushed past in a blur , then the scramjet kicked in just as they cleared the end of the launch rail and the Navatar stood the plane on its tail , rising vertically through a scattering of patchy cumulus clouds at mach seven going on seventeen . The Navatar kept part of its consciousness focused on Kelly , and it was pleased to see his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wonder as the sky darkened and the Earth receded below . <p> " You 're a junior ? " it asked . <p> " Yyyuuh , " Kelly granted . <p> " Change your major . I 'll wait . " <p> FIVE YEARS LATER , the Navatar had the distinct pleasure of carrying Kelly Turner all the way to the Moon . Kelly had graduated at the top of his class , and his background in economics had given him the perfect combination of skills to join the first Alpha Centauri colony mission . <p> " Colonization is n't all farming and construction , " Kelly told the Navatar on the flight out . " You 've got to have at least a barter system to keep track of obligations , or nobody can specialize . " <p> " I had never considered that , " the Navatar said . <p> " Not many people do . That 's why they need me . " <p> The Navatar pondered his words in the months to come . With a little coaxing , Kelly had found his niche , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantee that it would go on the mission to Alpha Centauri . <p> AIs did n't go to school . They updated their programming if they needed new skills , or if programming was n't available for what they needed to do , then they gained those new skills through experience . The Navatar had sold its experience set many times to other shuttle pilots , but there were no interstellar starship pilots from which to learn . <p> There was , however , an upcoming grand tour of the solar system that was supposed to serve as a shakedown cruise for the starship . The Navatar applied for the job and lobbied hard to be chosen , even offering to buy out its own contract from the Lunar passenger service if necessary . It made personal calls to the mission planners and solicited personal recommendations from all its former employers , including Kelly Turner . <p> It was n't the only AI with ambition , but it was the only spaceship pilot with experience in getting a family to work , school , shopping , and soccer matches on time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerably more difficult , but when the final decision came down , the Navatar 's qualifications were second to none . <p> Kelly did n't go on the flight . They did n't need an economist on a shakedown cruise , and he could get all the spacecraft training he needed right there on the Moon . So the Navatar once again forged into new territory on its own . It sent back images of all the planets , plus a few asteroids and comets for good measure . It ran the engines up to full power for a solid week , pushing the starship up to one percent of the speed of light before it turned the ship end-for-end and slowed down enough for Neptune 's gravity to swing it around toward Pluto . It coasted for weeks in the outer solar system , out where the Sun was just a bright star , testing its lifesystem and communications system and everything else the crew would need during the long trip to Alpha Centauri . <p> The ship came home triumphant , and the mission planners threw a party that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the crew spent much of the following week cleaning up the debris . <p> Then they began stocking up for the real trip . That took months , but the Navatar stayed busy going over cargo manifests and fretting about the state of the electronics . There would be no turning back once they passed the Sun 's cometary halo , and no ordering shipments from home if they forgot anything . <p> At last the mission was ready . The ship was packed , the crew was on board , and the fuel tanks were full . While bands played and speakers speechified and half the planet looked upward to catch a glimpse of the drive flame , the Navatar lit the engines and the great starship broke Lunar orbit under full thrust . <p> Earth and Moon dwindled until they were bright specks , then dim specks . The Sun followed suit . The starship passed its earlier speed record , then doubled it , and doubled it again and again and again . Radar warned of approaching comets and the Navatar steered wide around them , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And still they accelerated into the night . <p> Occasionally Kelly would visit the bridge , and he and the Navatar would talk . The bridge crew thought it a bit odd at first , but Kelly was beyond embarrassment at talking to an AI . They caught up on old times and they discussed the ship , the crew , and their plans for after they arrived at Alpha Centauri . They had years of flight ahead of them , but those years flew faster and faster the closer they grew . <p> At midpoint the Navatar turned the ship around and began to slow down again , and they continued on with little change until they reached the edges of the Centauri system . There , the Navatar got busy . Once again it had to dodge comets and unmapped asteroids , then correct the ship 's path as planets of unknown mass pulled it this way and that , all the while avoiding meteor streams from old comet tails . There seemed to be a lot of those ; apparently Alpha Centauri 's double stars perturbed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sun 's . Everything had to be considered and accounted for , and there was no room for error . <p> As they drew closer , their target planet swelled in the monitors , blue and white and so Earthlike that the Navatar finally understood deja vu . Spectroscopic analysis said the atmosphere was breathable , and temperatures ranged from freezing at the poles to hot but bearable at the equator . There were continents , oceans , islands , and ice caps . People could live there . <p> The crew busied themselves getting ready for exploration , but the Navatar had one final task before they could do that . The starship would serve as their space station once the Navatar put it into orbit . That was a job it had done thousands of times back on Earth , but there it had had dozens of global positioning satellites to tell it exactly where it was and how fast it was going . Here there was nothing but the planet itself : a big target , but hard to get a precise position fix on when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown mass concentrations that could throw off even the finest navigation . <p> " No problem , " the Navatar told Kelly . " I drove a bus in snow . Compared to that , this is a piece of cake . " <p> " Well , then , " he replied , " I 'll go take a nap while you do your thing . " <p> " That 's fine so long as you can sleep in your crash harness . " <p> Human and AI considered one another for a long moment . Then Kelly said , " Wake me up when we get there . " <p> The final approach went smoothly . The astronomers ' best estimate put the planet at ninety percent of Earth 's mass , plus or minus three percent . That six-percent window left a big variable in the equations , but the Navatar played it safe , steering wide until it could get a better figure . That meant going into an elliptical orbit the first time around , and the ship would be pointing the wrong way to circularize it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that or risk dipping into the atmosphere on the first pass . <p> The first sign of trouble came when they were still a thousand miles away . Their flight path deviated from the projection by just a fraction of a degree , but it was a significant fraction . The planet was more massive than the astronomers had predicted , and was pulling the ship closer than the Navatar had planned . Not a big problem , but it meant revising their path on the fly , with only a few minutes to reorient the ship . <p> The Navatar accessed the intercom to Kelly 's quarters . " Your planet has a larger core than you thought , " it said . " At least twenty percent . " <p> " Bigger , or just more massive ? " Kelly replied . <p> " I ca n't tell from here . You 'll have to find out with seismographs on the ground . " <p> " I wonder if that 's going to mean more mineral concentration on the surface , too ? " <p> " More gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gold would be good for more than just a medium of exchange , " Kelly said . " It 's one of the most useful metals we have . But I 'd settle for a good iron deposit at first . We 're going to need things like nails and plows and wheels . " <p> " From the looks of things , there will be plenty of that . " <p> Indeed , from the ship 's flight path , the Navatar estimated nearly double the amount of iron of Earth . If even a fraction of that wound up on the surface , there would be enough to support an industrial society . <p> The Navatar focused its attention on the radar altimeter . It did n't ignore the collision radar , but it did n't dwell on it , either . Maybe if it had , it would have spotted the meteor , but the first indication it had that anything was amiss was when the ship shuddered with the impact and structural integrity alarms began to wail . <p> The ship 's atmosphere began roaring out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slammed shut , but the rock had grazed the side of the ship , ripping a long gash through section after section . Kelly 's quarters were in one of those that would n't seal . <p> The intercom erupted with a babble of voices , but the Navatar ignored them all . It had no time for conversation ; everything it had went into working the new equation . <p> Some of the crew would survive if it continued with the orbital insertion , but at least half of them would not . On the other hand , they could breathe the planet 's atmosphere if the Navatar could just get the ship into that atmosphere in time . There was a good chance they could all survive if the Navatar could set the ship down in one piece . It was never designed to land ; even if the Navatar was successful , the ship would never fly again , but given the extent of the damage , that seemed unlikely in any case . <p> There was no real choice . Programming it had n't used for decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above all else . It lit the engines and throttled them up to full power , killing the ship 's orbital velocity in one long burn . It altered their course as well , no longer fighting the planet 's gravity , but letting it pull them in until the tail of the ship was aimed at one of the major continents . <p> Auroras flared where the drive flame hit the atmosphere , lighting the night side of the planet with false dawn . The ship arrowed in tailfirst , blasting away the first wisps of air with its own superhot plasma , dropping deeper and deeper as it slowed . But it was n't slowing enough . The ground rose up to swat the ship out of the sky , and the Navatar ran the engines up beyond their rated power maximum , not caring how badly they were damaged so long as they lasted long enough . <p> The starship slowed , descending toward a landscape that flamed and blew away under its exhaust , until at last it hovered , then started to rise again . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ship was designed to withstand a full gravity of thrust , so it would n't collapse under its own weight , but neither would it stand upright on its own . Worse , the moment the exhaust nozzles touched the ground , the engines would explode . The Navatar would have to drop it the last ten feet or so without power . <p> There was a low bluff about a mile away . The Navatar tilted the ship in its direction until it drifted that way , melting a glassy path across the rolling hills until the bluff loomed up beside it . The Navatar straightened the ship , lowering the thrust until it dropped as close to the ground as it dared , then , just before it met the cliff , shut off the engines . <p> There was a moment of free-fall , then a solid crunch . Almost simultaneously , the ship lurched sideways as it leaned against the cliff . <p> Do n't tip over , do n't tip over , the Navatar thought . <p> A DAYLATER , The Navatar looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough away to afford a good picture of the whole thing . <p> " I 'm a mess , " it said when it saw the crumpled side wedged against the cliff and the long gash the meteor had torn down its flank . <p> " You saved our lives , " Kelly replied . <p> " Perhaps , but if I had been paying more attention to the radar - " <p> " Do n't second-guess yourself . We 're down , we 're safe , and we 've got all our stuff close at hand to start the colony with . You did good . " <p> " I seem to have piloted myself out of a job . " <p> Kelly laughed . " We 've got plenty of work for you to do . " <p> " Oh ? Like what ? " <p> " Well , we did n't get much of a look at the countryside around here on our way in . Somebody 's going to have to go scout out the territory . If it 's not too ignoble an assignment , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The Navatar thought about that for a few seconds . " ' Good ' is the operative term . You have already been in two wrecks with me at the helm . " <p> " And I 'm still here to brag about it , " Kelly said . " Besides , I 'm a bean-counter . I 'm not on the exploration team . " <p> " How magnanimous of you , then , to suggest me as the driver . " <p> Kelly shrugged . " Somebody 's got to do it . Would you prefer we sent the cook ? " <p> The Navatar had met the cook . Its interests lay almost entirely in pots and pans and vegetables and seasonings . The explorers would eat well , until they fell into a ravine . <p> The Navatar focused its attention on the expanse of rolling hills visible to the side of the remote camera 's field of view . Unscouted territory . An entire planet 's worth . It could take centuries to explore it all in a ground vehicle . And who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll drive , " said the Navatar . <p> Sidebar
