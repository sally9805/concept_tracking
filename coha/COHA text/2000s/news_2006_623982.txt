<p> Gathered around the plastic red-and-white tablecloths in the back room of a San Francisco hofbrau , 30 of the Bay Area 's " out " atheists were recasting themselves as the protagonists of America 's newest civil rights struggle . <p> As they described the strain of being openly atheistic in an increasingly religious culture , many wished their godless crusade would emulate one social movement in particular  --  the fight for gay rights . <p> " You can be elected as an openly gay politician in this country , but you ca n't be elected as an openly atheistic one , " said Lori Lipman Brown , who was hired last fall to be the Washington , D.C. , lobbyist for an organization devoted to atheist causes , the Secular Coalition for America . She 's believed to be the first paid lobbyist for the unbelievers in the nation 's capital , the front lines of the culture wars . <p> Now , all Brown is seeking is a constituency willing to go public . <p> " Think of where the LGBT movement was 25 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay and lesbian rights issues as a legislator and attorney . " That 's where atheists are today . " <p> Brown stopped by the Van Ness Avenue restaurant Tommy 's Joynt recently to address the faithless as part of a West Coast barnstorming tour to raise money and awareness for the atheists ' new tack . Like other leading atheists , the 47-year-old former Nevada state legislator , teacher and attorney freely borrows from gay rights nomenclature to make her point . <p> Brown , who is married and was raised a " humanistic Jew , " talks about how she " came out " as an atheist several years ago , and how most atheists are n't " out yet " at work . She says atheist kids  --  like many gay children  --  are made to feel outcasts at school , and explains that she wants to erase the negative connotation to the word " atheist " just as homosexuals have reclaimed slurs like " queer " and " dyke . " <p> " When a congressional aide reads our material alongside that from the NEA ( National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says ' Atheist ' at the top , " Brown said , proffering a business card that says , " Atheists . Humanists . Freethinkers . Americans , " with the last word in bold type . <p> When it comes to atheism , she said , " we 're not avoiding the word . " <p> Rick Wingrove , a 56-year-old former Navy Seabee who in January was named a federal lobbyist for American Atheists , another national group , said atheists have to be loud and proud when pressing their point in Washington . <p> " We 're saying , ' We 're here , we 're queer , get used to it , ' " said Wingrove , an unpaid , part-time lobbyist whose day job is as a Web developer . " And I 'm not gay . " <p> So why have n't more atheists picked up the atheist pride megaphone and started shouting ? <p> The problem , said Arthur Jackson , who has been part of the Bay Area 's atheist community for more than 40 years , is that the movement has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't had our Stonewall , " Jackson said , referring to the 1969 riots in New York that spawned the modern gay rights movement . <p> The reaction from gay rights organizations to this admiration is muted , even among those that usually have no problem taking bold political stands . Privately , some point out that the comparison of atheists to historically persecuted groups is n't exact  --  atheism is arguably a choice , not an orientation , and unlike racial minorities , the godless are n't discriminated against on the basis of their looks . <p> " I 'd have to say we 're really neutral on this one ( atheists emulating the gay rights struggle ) , " said Brad Luna , a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign , the nation 's largest gay and lesbian rights organization , with 600,000 members . " We have many members who are very religious , and many who are n't at all . " <p> Representatives of the National Center for Lesbian Rights , and Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders declined to comment . <p> Brown said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not like we 've tried Rick Santorum 's office , " referring to the conservative Republican senator from Pennsylvania . <p> Others on Capitol Hill say they do n't have a problem working with atheists , at least on some issues . <p> " We 'll cooperate with other organizations on our shared goals , but that does n't mean we endorse the rest of their agenda , " said Hollyn Hollman , general counsel for the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty , which is supported by 14 Baptist organizations . Her group and the Secular Coalition have worked together to oppose parts of the Bush administration 's faith-based initiatives that they feel discriminate against secular organizations . <p> " We do n't see them having any stigma that would prevent us from working with them , " said Afshin Mohamadi , communications director for Rep. Carolyn Maloney , D-N.Y . The Secular Coalition supported a bill by Maloney that would require a pharmacy to provide a woman with birth control even if a staff pharmacist refused to fill a prescription on religious grounds . <p> Several on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friendly face on atheism , which for decades was personified by Madelyn Murray O'Hair . Life magazine once dubbed O'Hair " the most hated woman in America , " and the media tended to portray her as intolerant and cranky . <p> " Lori 's a nice , smiling , eager-to-please person with an agreeable personality , " Hollman said . " And she seems to have enough experience with government to not get overwhelmed here . " <p> But Brown admits that the godless are far from a force on Capitol Hill . The Secular Coalition 's annual budget of $120,000 is what some lobbyists spend annually on lunch . Wingrove , the American Atheists ' lobbyist , is part-time . Their job is largely playing defense against legislation that they see as inserting religion into government . <p> Both say a bigger challenge in creating a coast-to-coast atheistic movement is figuring out how many supporters they have and how to activate them into a political force . <p> Depending on how a poll question is asked , atheists say , America has anywhere from 5 million to 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's national e-mail list of supporters is a mere 1,700 . Not exactly a force that could make even a state legislator listen . <p> Of those who are " out , " relatively few are young or women . Only a third or so of the folks at Tommy 's Joynt were women , and more than half the crowd had silver hair . <p> " When a young person shows up to a meeting , they usually always tell me , ' Go talk to them , ' " said Adrienne Mowery , a 32-year-old San Franciscan who has been an atheist since her childhood in Texas . <p> Mowery struggled to explain why more young people do n't turn up at atheist gatherings . Are young atheists just too apathetic to come to get organized , or are most godless types really just white-haired retirees ? <p> " It takes a lot of thinking to get to the point where you do n't believe , " said Jackson , who is 73 . As for the gender gap , he says , " Atheism is a head thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something rather than to sit around and talk and talk . " <p> While the " out " atheists tend largely to be older , male and white , their political views are not monolithic , said Brown and the other atheists gathered at Tommy 's Joynt . They cover the range of opinions on everything from gay marriage to abortion to taxes to the war in Iraq . <p> During the recent confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito , the Secular Coalition was one of few groups expressing no interest in the nominee 's view of Roe vs . Wade . It was more interested in his views on the First Amendment 's establishment clause , which says Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion . <p> Yet Brown kept the politics light as she addressed the crowd at Tommy 's Joynt . All she asked her fellow atheists to do was to let themselves be counted as atheists , as part of a movement . <p> " When I go into a congressional office , " Brown said , " " the first thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my district ? ' " <p> Until more atheists come out of the closet , she ca n't say . <p> Other Capitol Hill interests can trot out celebrities to attract media attention at the right moment . Brown said atheists have Teller , the one-name-only half of the comedy-magic team Penn and Teller . <p> Part of Teller 's shtick in the act : He never speaks . Lori Lipman Brown , of the Secular Coalition for America , is believed to be the nation 's first paid lobbyist for atheists . She met with local atheists at a San Francisco restaurant , looking for those who would go public with their lack of faith . / Kim Komenich / The Chronicle
