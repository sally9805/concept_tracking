" I do n't want to achieve immortality through my work , " Woody Allen once said . " I want to achieve itthrough not dying . " Too late . In a rare interview , the 70-year-old director reflects on his prolific career and his new film , Match Point . by Josh Rottenberg // STEPPING GINGERLY INTO AN ELEGANTLY APPOINTED hotEL SUITE IN Beverly Hills , shoulders slouched , eyes casing the room , Woody Alien looks a little out of his element . No surprise : This is the man who raised feeling uncomfortable-in social settings , in love , in a cold and godless universe-to an art form , and , as anyone familiar with his life and work knows , Los Angeles is not exactly his turf . As the Brooklyn-bred fflmmaker quipped in his 1977 masterpiece Annie Hall , Los Angeles is " a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light . " * Settling into a sofa , Alien says he enjoys visiting L.A. , " but I could never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I do n't like the sunshine . " * But Allen has been straying outside his comfort zone more and more lately . Even as his films have struggled to find an audience , he has entered into new partnerships , like a three-picture deal with Dream Works from 2000 to 2002 , that step up the pressure on him to at least break even at the box office . In 2001 , he split with his longtime friend and producer Jean Doumanian in a bitter legal battle . The next year , he stunned audiences by making his first-ever appearance at the Academy Awards-in a tuxedo , no less . His new film , Match Point-his 36th-represents another unexpected turn . Filmed in England , with a mainly British cast , it 's a straight-up Hitehcoekian thriller : the story of a social-climbing tennis pro ( Jonathan Rhys Meyers ) who dives into a passionate , ill-fated affair with his brother-in-law 's fiance ( Scarlett Johansson ) . Since debuting at the Cannes film festival-where Alien walked the red carpet and did his best to smile for the cameras-Match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heralded as a return to form for the director and earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Drama . Allen seems wary of the buzz . " People like to talk , " he says distnissively . The reality is , after 50-plus yeaiB in show business , he heard it all . He 's been hailed as a comic genius and attacked as a self-indulgent narcissist . His films have been celebrated as cultural events ( Annie Hall , Manhattan , the list goes on ) and panned or , worse , ignored ( September , Anything Else , that list goes on as well ) . His persona as the neurotic Everyman made him an unlikely folk hero , while his offscreen life-most notably the revelation in 1992 of his afiair with his current wife Soon-Yi Previn , the adopted daughter of his longtime girlfriend and cinematic muse Mk Farrow-brought scorn from some quarters . Alien says he tunes out the background dinof acciaim , disdain , and everything in between : " Even when I 'm embraced , I 'm not embraced warmly . It does n't matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 . He 's a little hard of hearing and moves more slowly than he used to . Yet he keeps plugging away , making a film a year with a regularity you can set a watch to . His parents lived to be 93 and 100 , and with his next comedy , Scoop , already in the can , he shows no signs of stopping . This constant forward motion ( " like a shark , " to quote Annie Hall again ) means Alien does nt look back much . But today , he ofters ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY a rare opportunity to revisit some of the highlights of his legendary career . seen through his famous thick-framed and far-from-rose-eolored glasses , it seems the hits and misses are sometimes one and the same . TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN 1969 Having won fame as a stand-up comic . Alien had transitioned into films as a writer and actor with What 's Hew , Pussycat ? , What 's Up , Tiger Lily ? , and Casino Royala . Still honing his comedie style , he made a promising solo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal . I felt I was ready to direct , but the people In my corner said , " People will resent It . They 'll think , Who Is this guy ? " So I tried to get Jerry Lewis , because I thought he was quite a good comedy director , and he agreed to direct It . But we could n't work it out with the I studio , and Jerry went off to do something else . Then this new company , Patomar Pictures , formed , and they were willing to take a chance on me . The picture was very well received critically , but two or three years after it came out , they had still not broken even . I knew I was not destined to be a cash cow . But even when I was a cabaret comic , I always had a tough time getting an audience . They 'd book me Into Caesars Palace In Las Vegas and they 'd have half a house . By the third be pulling the patted plants In so they could make the space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orgasmatron of inspired silliness , this futuristic RIp Van Winkle comedy displayed Alien 's growing storytelling I skill , though the difficulties of creating the world of 2173 ( giant bananas and all ) forced him to pour his salary Into reshoots . Most Important , the film showcased his comedic chemistry with a young actress named Diane Keaton , with whom he had been romantically involved . Marshall Brickman and I wanted to write a movie that was n't just gag-gag-gag . I was good at writing gags , but to write a story with a real plot and real characters-that was much harder . I was used to working as a comic , where If you do n't hear the laughs for 60 seconds , it 's disconcerting . I had a small budget , and I was working in the future , so every car had to be built , every costume had to be designed . Fortunately , my costume designer was Joel Schumacher . He had , like , a $10,000 budget to do all the costumes , but he was brilliant and Inventive and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done a play with her , Play It Again , Sam , we had lived together , and we were very close . I Just felt she had a limitless comic talent . I 've always felt that the two great movie comediennes of all time were Judy Holllday and Diane Keaton . ANNIE HALL 1977 Allen 's artistic breakthrough had a difficult birth . In Its two-hour-and-30-minute rough cut , the film ( originally titled Anhedonia ) was a formless collection of comic bits and pieces . After extensive and ruthless editing , the 93-mlnute film that emerged would become one of the most Iconic romantic comedies In Hollywood history . Audiences did n't just love it-they luhrved It , they luffed it , and the film earned Academy Awards for Best Picture , Best Director , Best Original Screenplay , and Best Actress for Keaton . Alien , however , was a no-show at the Oscars . The movie was originally supposed to be what my character was thinking . In a not really coherent fashion . It was this abstract experimental Idea of my mind at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there were many other parts . And I shot it that way . But when Marshall Brlckman saw the first cut , he said , " I wrote It with you and even I ca n't follow tt . " So we restructured It and reshot the ending many times . I was able to find the love story , and audiences were charmed by It beyond my expectations . I did n't save outtakes or any of that stuff . I 'm not a big nostalgia person . They gave the Oscars out Monday evenings in those days . I always played clarinet with my Jazz band on Monday evenings , and It was something I always looked forward to . I do n't like to fly . I do n't like to get Into a tuxedo . So I 'm not going to suddenly cancel my band and fly to California . People made a big deal out of that , but I do n't write movies to win awards . INTERIORS 1978 Allen 's abrupt turn toward drama with this somber , Bergmanesque portrait of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I dldnt see It coming . There were people who loved It , and there were other people who thought I was committing a crime : I was In bad faith , I had violated my contract with the audience . I did n't feel It was fair . I thought I should be able to try something , even if I made the worst film In the world . After Interiors I knew there would be consequences tf I tried to make that kind of Him again . But I did IL Because the alternative is letting other people tell you exactly what to do In your career . Maybe they 're even right , but , you know , It 's hard to live that way . MANHATTAN 1979 A wistfully romantic ode to Alien 's hometown and an indelible portrait of angsty urbanites in search of love , this gorgeously shot , Gershwin-drenched comic drama grossed nearly $40 million . Alien 's biggest hit up to this point , and was hailed as another triumph-by everyone but Alien himself . I was so disappointed when I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good as I can do at this point , I should n't be making films . I went to United Artists and said , " Look , do nt put this out . I 'll make another film , no charge . " They thought I was nuts . And it was a very , very big hit . Audiences do nt have the sama criteria I do . They say , Okay , you had some grandiose Idea and maybe you failed , but we like this film . So once again , I shut up and just fett I got away with it . I got off with my life . STARDUST MEMORIES 1980 The most polarizing film of Alien 's career concerns a successful director , played by Allen , whose mlolife crisis plays out across a surreal , Fellini-esque canvas . Many were angered by the film 's bitter , mocking portrayal of critics and moviegoers as sycophants and vulgarians . I certainly did not think my audience was stupid or grotesque , the way they seemed to be portrayed In the movie . I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too smart to express them . I had an Idea about an artist who had everything in the world and still couldnt beat his sense of mortality-that 's all that was Interesting to me . But It was not taken that way . It was taken as an act of hostility . I 've played the part of the neurotic so intensely and so often , when a movie like Stardust Memories comes out , It 's very hard for audiences to separate me from the character . Chaplin could put on the little tramp 's hat , but I go on the screen like this , so they make the assumption that I 'm that guy . But It 's not me . A few months after the movie came out , John Lennon was murdered . In my movie , I show that exactly : The relationship between the audience and the entertainer Is very often a kind of worship but also homicidal . I felt I had a good Insight Into that world . HANNAH AND HER SISTERS 1986 This novelistic look at the tangled lives and loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan as Allen 's biggest-grossing film . But In his mind , It did n't come oui the way he had Intended . I had written a different ending that was not as upbeat : Michael Calne 's character is still hopelessly In love with his wife Hannah 's sister , who has married another guy because he could n't bring himself to act , and he 's stuck with Hannah and It 's going to be a nothing marriage . And I shot that ending . But when I looked at It , It was tike the picture dropped off the table . It was negative-and not like a good , Ghekhovlan negative , it was an Inept negative , a downer . So I guided the thing Instinctively to an ending where all the characters came out happy , and the picture was very successful . But I never felt positive about It I felt I had a very poignant Idea , but finally could n't bring It home . CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS 1989 One of Alien 's most deft balancing acts of comedy and drama juxtaposes a morality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plots to murder his mistress , with a comic story featuring Alien as a struggling fllmmaker . For me , the Interesting story was Marty Landau 's story , and as I was putting that picture together , I so regretted that I had my story In there . I thought , My God , If I had made this film just about Marty and his predicament , It would have been so much of a better movie , fts soon as I put myself in the picture , I felt that It ratcheted down In substance Instantly , because I can only play a clown , a joker . I 'm always seduced by serious stuff . I wish my gift In life had been Tennessee Williams ' gift or lngmar Bergman 's or Eugene O'Neill 's . It wasn't-my strong point was comedy , Comedy can never go as deep , by its very nature ; when a situation becomes tense , you make ajoke and It relieves It . These are Just personal feelings of mine . Other people do n't feel thai way . HUSBANDS AND WIVES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit theaters as his personal troubles were exploding in the press , bringing his decade-plus-long on-screen and offscreen partnership with Farrow to a crashing end . The movie had no relation to my life In any way . But when It came out , my private life was all over the headlines . I could always work under stress , though . Whenever things go bad , the two things I 've always been able to do are lose myself In work and lose myself in sleep . Work has always been a llfesaver . I can Immerse myself In the problems of the second-act finale and avoid having to face the problems that are really unpleasant and that I ca n't deal with . SWEET AND LOWDOWN 1999 Sean Penn and Samantha Morion earned Oscar nominations for this bittersweet period piece about a callously self-absorbed jazz guitarist who Is as reprehensible In his life as he Is brilliant in his art . I liked that movie-It was one of the ones , like The Purple flose of Cairo 10851 or Husbands and Wives , that came out very much the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost from the start of my career , around the time of Bananas 1971 , and I was going to play the guitar player . I went to United Artists and they said , " We assumed you were going to do comedies when we signed this contract . " So I took It back and two weeks later I gave them Bananas . Years later , I rewrote It for Sean . When I was younger , I could have played It , but I never would have brought to It Sean 's acting skill and his tortured persona . MATCH POINT 2005 Critics are hailing Alien 's latest as a comeback , but in his mind , he 's never gone anywhere . I had the idea for a while to do a murder story where the murderer kills the victim 's next-door neighbor so It looks like the other murder was Just in passing , to deflect the police . Then when I made the guy a tennis player , the metaphor came of getting the bounce one way or the other , and the thing evolved from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different direction and " this Is what 's happening In his private life so he does this or that . " None of that ever enters Into it remotely . I Just sit In a room or walk the streets In New York and think , Gee , what should I do next ? It 's always Just by sheer chance . I could make 10 movies In a row that would be as serious as Interiors or as light as Small Time Crooks . There 's no way of me knowing . I 'm just happy to get any ideas . <p>
