America Shops // We 're driving toward the mall . // I spend a lot of time in malls . Too much , I think . I daydream of life on a ranch out west where I 'd go to Wal-Mart every two weeks for groceries , and that would be it for me and shopping . // It will never happen . // You are riding with a tall , bald , stuttering research wonk on the cusp of his fifty-third year . I am called a retail anthropologist , which makes me uncomfortable , especially around my colleagues still in academia who have many more degrees than I do . For whatever combination of reasons , I 've spent my adult life studying people shopping . I watch how they move through stores and other commercial environments - restaurants , banks , fast-food joints , movie theaters , car dealerships , the post office , concert halls . Even in church , I study people . It is an odd skill , not one I would have sought . Yet I am good at it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not doing it . // I am definitely not a shopper . I do n't own lots of stuff . When I do buy , in spite of whatever professional knowledge I have , I perform like an ordinary guy . // I own a research and consulting business called Envirosell . We work with merchants , marketers , and retail bankers around the world . Our specialty is looking at the interaction between people and products , and people and spaces . We look at all the ways in which retailers , product manufacturers , bankers , restaurateurs , and commercial and other public spaces either meet ( or fail to meet ) their customers ' needs . It is a niche business , but it 's our niche . We 've been doing it for almost twenty years . // Our home office is in a funky landmark building , a former hotel , in New York City , in the middle of what was the department store district at the turn of the nineteenth century . We have an old-fashioned manual elevator run by a guy named Billy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sit in the old manager 's office , which has a gas fireplace I have never used . My south-facing windows look out onto what was once a Lord &amp; Taylor store . It 's now a shop that sells fancy dishes . We also have offices in Milan , S ? o Paolo , Mexico City , Tokyo , Moscow , and Istanbul . // We have done hundreds of research jobs in mall stores . There are only six states of the fifty where we have n't worked a mall ( the Dakotas , Alaska , Montana , Wyoming , and Louisiana ) . I average 130 days a year away from home , nearly all of which are spent in retail settings . I have been inside about three hundred North American malls , and some in other countries - Canada , Argentina , Brazil , Mexico , the United Arab Emirates , Italy , France , Spain , Holland , Germany , Sweden , Finland , Britain , Norway , Portugal , Turkey , Australia , Japan , Korea , Malaysia , Hong Kong ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mall somewhere in the United States - the Galleria in Houston , say , or the Del Amo in L.A. - I can picture the place , whether I want to or not . There are more than one hundred American malls to which I could give you accurate driving directions off the top of my head . I do n't know whether to be proud or ashamed . // Okay , look around . // We 're getting close to the mall , but you 'd never know it . There are no directional signs anywhere on this highway , as there might be if we were headed toward Disney World or New York City or some other destination . The mall itself is n't a looming , dominating presence , even on this flat suburban landscape . We 're just about to pass the only marker , a smallish road sign directing us to our exit , but beyond that there 's nothing to steer us toward the mall , no attempt to inspire an impulse purchase , no billboard aimed at the road-weary traveler with an hour or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entity , but it tends to appeal strictly to the local shopper , the one who is already familiar with it and what it has to offer . // It 's our mall . Maybe you have a mall , too . // You see a lot of a community 's life in its mall . Families especially tend not to be on display in very many public spaces nowadays . You can find people in places of worship , but they tend to be on their best behavior , and they 're mostly just standing or sitting . Increasingly , cities are becoming the province of the rich , the childless , or the poor . I love cities . But America has n't lived there for a long time . The retail arena is still the best place I know for seeing what people wear and eat and look like , how they interact with their parents and friends and lovers and kids . If you really want to observe entire middle-class multigenerational American families , you have to go to the mall . // It 's also not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like named Daniel Roche wrote a book called A History of Everyday Things . In it , he examines and reconstructs the lives not of kings , queens , and generals but of ordinary French people in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries - what they ate , what they wore , what they knew , and how they acquired what knowledge and possessions they had . In the spirit of Daniel Roche , this book is not about the official history of shopping malls and the tycoons who build and manage them . This is about malls , stores , and parking lots as experienced by us consumers . // Studying shopping provides the rhythm that governs my life - pack , leave home , fly somewhere , pick up a rental car , check into a hotel , then drive to a mall or store . For myself and my colleagues , it 's a life of science and research , except instead of going to an excavation site in Peru , we end up at Tyson 's Corner , a mall outside Washington , D.C. It 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odder way of experiencing and understanding a time and place . // On the other hand , I never run out of socks . // The job has become a habit . If I have two hours to kill before a flight out of Dallas , I 'll visit the Irving Mall or Outdoor World on my way to the airport . I do n't know what I expect to find ; but like any research geek , I 'm constantly on the lookout for something I have n't seen before - some innovation in digital signage , or a new sneaker style , or an interesting way to manage the line at the cash register . If I 'm on vacation and get bored with the beach , I 'll find the nearest mall and spend an afternoon there . It 's not such a weird thing to do . If I said I enjoy a stroll along Madison Avenue in Manhattan , where Armani and Calvin and Donna Karan sit cheek by jowl , you 'd understand . Doing it at the Beverly Center in Los Angeles or Bluewater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first big research project my company landed , studying AT&amp;T stores in two suburban Chicago malls . Back then it was just me and a few freelance researchers out in the field . Over a four-month period , we studied several incarnations of the same basic store , which meant I practically lived in those malls . I 'd arrive at the telephone store and arrange the time-lapse cameras to watch how shoppers interacted with the merchandise and displays . The film cassettes had to be changed every two hours , so I could n't stray too far , but unlike my researchers , I did n't have to remain inside the store . Moreover , I felt it was my responsibility not to appear in my own research footage . As a result , I spent many days roaming those malls - from ten a.m. to ten p.m. without a single productive thing to do except change film . I went into every store . I did n't buy much , but I saw a lot . // My fascination with stores is rooted in childhood . My father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Third World nations and behind the Iron Curtain , my national identity was secondhand and based heavily on the Sears catalog . But to those around me , I was all-American . Sometimes I paid the price , like when I was beaten up on the street in Warsaw after the Bay of Pigs in 1961 , or when rocks were thrown at our car in Seoul . When the kids in the British Army School I attended in Malaya chose sides for playground games , it often wound up as the few Americans against the rest of the world . // Still , to me America was always a far-off , mystical place , familiar yet completely exotic and fascinating . I wanted to feel connected to it , even long distance . When we 'd return briefly to the States , I 'd look at what the other kids were wearing , or playing with , or watching on TV , and realize how hopelessly out of it I was . It was painful to ask my grandmother to send me rock records , knowing that what she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Welk . In Kuala Lumpur in 1963 there was no American Bandstand on TV , no T-shirts or lunch boxes . I was in cultural exile . My friend Steve was a little older than I and listened to a radio station he picked up from Bangkok . Thanks to him I knew that the Beatles existed , but that was about it . // Even today , that early cultural deprivation haunts my life . I am no good at the board game Trivial Pursuit , having missed too many cultural references from the 1960s and 1970s . I 've had friends try to explain to me what was so hilarious about Rocky and Bullwinkle , or who the Waltons were , and why girls who favor Laura Ashley always liked Little House on the Prairie . I still do n't get it . // Having gone from life abroad to living in downtown Manhattan , the shopping center was still an exotic locale , something I 'd heard about but had little real exposure to . It 's where , for the first time , I felt completely swallowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad at all . I suddenly understood those 1980s ? migr ? s from the Soviet Union who would come to this country and cry tears of joy over the splendor they found in the produce aisle of an average supermarket . At last I found what seemed to be the real America , and it was out shopping . // The morning of September 11 , 2001 , I was stranded in Dallas , unable to get home , which is a twenty-minute walk from what was the World Trade Center . On September 12 I spent the day wandering around the new mall in Plano , Texas . I just gravitated there . I needed to be around something familiar . It was the eeriest thing , though - a sparkling mall , in the middle of a beautiful September afternoon , with all the stores open and not a single shopper in the place . Around one-thirty I walked into a RadioShack and asked the clerk , " Am I the first person you 've had in here today ? " // " Yup , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to see a movie . I was just in time for Tortilla Soup . I was the only person in the theater . They screened it for me anyway . After the show I returned to my hotel , but I still had lots of time on my hands , so a few hours later I drove back to one of the mall 's restaurants for dinner . // I was the only customer , but by the end of my meal the manager and the waiter had joined me at my table , and we three sat around drinking and talking , just the same as many people across the United States did that night . It felt all right to be doing it in a mall . // As I said before , I 've devoted a lot of my life to malls , and in a few minutes we 'll begin spending another Saturday in a typical one . We 'll have lots of company . // Look up ahead - you still ca n't see it , but take my word , we 're almost there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
