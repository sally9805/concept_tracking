Joey DePino was the only gambler at the Meadowlands braving the frigid night to watch the last race outside . He was standing by the rail near the finish line in his stone-washed jeans and his blue-and-red New York Giants official team winter jacket . When the white pace car sped past with the long starting gate , he yelled , " Leave with him , Cat Man ! " hoping to see his eight horse and Catello Manzi sprinting for the lead . But Manzi was either in on a fix or the damn horse just did n't want to run , because the eight was last , in the middle of the track , looking lame as the pacers rounded the first turn . " Cocksucker ! " Joey screamed . He tossed his program away over his shoulder and headed toward the grandstand . The bus to Manhattan left at twenty minutes after the last race and he wanted to get a jump on the crowd . The Meadowlands had been modernized a few years ago , but putting in some snazzy new restaurants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference . The whole place still had a run-down feel to it , mainly because of the crowd . Angry old men , huddled in small groups , stood cursing at the television sets that were showing the closed-circuit broadcast of the race . The floor was covered with losing tickets , spilled beer , and spit ; the air was a haze of cigarette smoke . At thirty-five , Joey was probably one of the youngest guys at the track , but years of gambling had made him look as old and beat-up as everyone else . He had dark bags under his eyes and most of his hair had fallen out . He used to lift weights , but that was a long time ago , when hestill lived in Brooklyn ; now he could n't remember the last time he had set foot in a gym . Tonight had cost Joey three hundred and sixty bucks , not including the price of three hot dogs , two slices of pizza and one Carvel ice cream cone . But this was only pocket change compared to the over nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because the bookies had stopped taking action from him , he had started to bet under phony names . But even " Tony " and " Nick " and " Vinnie " had tapped out their figures . He had zero money in the bank and with rent and bills coming up he had no idea what new story he 'd make up to tell his wife Maureen . At a television set above the betting windows , Joey stopped to watch the end of the race . His horse still was n't in the picture . He could n't remember the last time he 'd left a racetrack with money in his wallet . Was it last month ? Last year ? He felt numb and exhausted ; it seemed like he had n't had a good night 's sleep in months . As the pacers turned into the stretch , the eight finally appeared on the screen . Manzi was moving the horse up on the rail , but seemed hopelessly boxed-in . In the stretch , he angled the horse off the rail , then he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he was still blocked . Joey was ready to walk away when Manzi somehow got loose . He steered the horse to the outside and started closing like a freight train . It still did n't look like he 'd get up in time , but the horse in front was staggering . Joey did n't even have time to scream . Manzi 's horse seemed to be moving twice as fast as the other horses , and he surged to the lead at the wire . It would be a photo finish but it was obvious that the eight had won the race . In an instant , Joey calculated his winnings . At sixty-five to one , the eight was the second longest shot in the field . He had bet forty dollars to win and had played the eight in a forty dollar daily double with the winner of the last race . All together , he would get back over $17,600 . He was too shocked to celebrate . He walked around the grandstand , breathing heavily , hoping he would n't have a heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He still could n't believe the eight had actually won . Joey DePino , the guy his friends in Brooklyn used to call " Joey the Jinx " because he always lost at the track , actually getting home a sixty-five-to-one shot ? There had to be some mistake . This was " Candid Camera " and that guy with the gray hair was gon na come out and shake his hand . He already had the money spent . Nine grand would go toward his debts . The other eight would go into the bank , maybe toward a down payment on a house in Staten Island or Jersey . Maureen had been begging him to move into a nicer place for years and he was sick of living in the city . He wanted to live in a place where he could own a car so he would n't have to take buses to the racetrack anymore . Then the crowd started to jeer . Joey felt the Carvel and hot dogs collapsing in his stomach . He ran to the nearest TV monitor , afraid to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inches when he saw the INQUIRY sign on the tote board . When the eight horse had made that move to lead , Manzi had cut off the horses to his outside . Joey had seen this clearly , but he had blocked it out in his excitement . Now he prayed to God for a miracle . Joey was half Jewish , half Italian , and he did n't believe in religion , but he swore to God he would pray every day for the rest of his life if He would just put up the fucking OFFICIAL sign . Sometimes the judges took five minutes or longer to decide whether a horse should be disqualified . Maybe tonight they were tired and wanted to go home because in less than a minute the tote board went blank and the revised order of finish was posted . The eight had been placed fourth . Joey 's horses had been disqualified before , but never for this much money and never when he needed the money this badly . He asked God what he had ever done to deserve this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any answer . Slowly , he walked toward the exit . He tried to tell himself that he was n't any worse off than he 'd been five minutes ago . But all he could think about was the damn INQUIRY sign and how nothing ever seemed to go right in his life . He was walking unsteadily . A few people bumped into him , saying " excuse me " or " sorry , " but he did n't even seem to notice . Leaving the grandstand , heading down the long ramp , Joey felt like he could lie down and sleep forever . But , typical of his luck , the bus had already filled and he had to stand the whole way back to Manhattan .
