When he died last year , Larry Tisch left behind a great family fortune , a troubled company , and a long shadow over his admiring family . Now it 's up to his son Jimmy to fix the company-and step out from under the shadow . // EARLY ON THE MORNING OF AUG. 15 , 2002 , Laurence Alan Tisch told his family that he was dying . He was sitting at his desk on the seventh floor of Loews Corp . headquarters in New York City , as he did most mornings . His office was sparse-beige walls , a sensible gray carpet . There was little evidence of his legendary career as one of the great business tycoons of his day . Here and there-on a windowsill , in a corner-a smattering of items hinted at it : a CBS Sports baseball bat , a matchbook from the Laurel-in-the-Pines hotel , a Loews human resources manual . On the couch across from his desk , oddly out of character , were two teddy bears . No one could remember where they came from . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his wife of five decades , and summoned the rest of his family : his brother , Bob , and his four sons , Andrew , Danny , Jimmy , and Tommy . No one except his wife knew why they 'd been called . But they all knew it was serious ; they 'd never been summoned like this before . Now gathered , they waited for him to speak . Larry did not say the words . He sat upright behind his desk , his eyes closed , as Billie uttered the technical terms : " metastasis , " " chemotherapy , " " secondary tumor . " Tisch had gastroesophageal cancer . It was inoperable . When Billie finished talking , the room was quiet . The news was an unexpected blow . Though 79 , Tisch had seemed quite healthy . He 'd gone to the doctor 's the day before because he had a slight pain in his side . He thought he 'd cracked a rib . For decades Larry Tisch had been his family 's patriarch , the dominant figure in the lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 , Larry had started a business with his 20-year-old brother , Bob . Over the next six decades , the Tisch brothers built one of America 's great family fortunes , estimated at more than $4 billion . Two of Larry 's sons , Jimmy and Andrew , along with Bob 's son , Jonathan , had spent their careers at Loews , working side by side with their fathers . Members of the younger generation at Loews regularly popped their heads into Larry 's office to solicit his advice or bounce an idea off him . It was hard to imagine what life would be like without Larry Tisch . Not that Larry was about to let anyone dwell on that . When he finally opened his eyes and looked around at his family , he said very simply , " Okay . Let 's go . " That had always been his way : terse , concise , abrupt . Without much else said , his family trooped out of his office and did what he expected them to do : get back to work . Larry Tisch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the greatest value investors and dealmakers ever , as well as a staggering philanthropic legacy : There must be a dozen buildings in New York with the Tisch name on them , including the Tisch Hospital at New York University , the Tisch Galleries at the Metropolitan Museum of Art , and the Tisch Children 's Zoo in Central Park . And to his everlasting credit , he left behind a family that has none of the friction and strife that so often divides wealthy families . Larry Tisch 's values-both in business and in life - appear to have been completely embraced by the next generation of Tisches . But Larry Tisch also left behind a company-Loews-that the next generation now runs and that has some real problems . Last year Loews lost more than $600 million ( on $16.5 billion in revenues ) , and though it is on track to do better this year , it is far from clear that the next generation has succeeded in turning the ship around . The Loews that exists today is an unwieldy conglomerate , with a hodgepodge of assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corp . Most of those are companies Larry Tisch bought decades ago , and they once made the family billions of dollars . But today , almost across the board , they are struggling . Loews stock , currently around $58 a share , trades roughly where it did two years ago . In the short term the task for Larry 's heirs is to fix the immediate problems facing each of Loews ' companies . Over the long haul , though , the task ahead is more difficult . They need to come up with their own vision for what Loews ought to be , separate and apart from the vision Larry Tisch laid out almost 60 years ago . If they can do that , they 'll have put their own stamp on Larry Tisch 's legacy . It 's a brilliant early spring morning and James S. Tisch-known to everyone as Jimmy-is at work . Though Larry Tisch has been dead four months , Jimmy has n't moved into his father 's old office ; it sits empty beyond the wall behind him . It 's not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his workday . The phone rings . It 's an executive at one of Loews ' companies , calling to give him a sales forecast . " What makes you think you can hit those numbers ? " Jimmy asks . His tone is friendly , even cheerful-but he 's clearly not buying the man 's numbers . " Let 's not look at this thing with rose-colored glasses , " he warns . By the end of the conversation , the executive has agreed to rethink his forecast . Jimmy , 51 , is his father 's most direct heir at Loews . He is the CEO . Along with his brother Andrew , 54 , and cousin Jonathan , 50 , he is also part of the office of the president , a management arrangement established by his father and uncle in 1999 . The Tisches assiduously downplay issues of power and status-it 's part of the way they maintain family harmony-and sure enough , Jimmy insists he relies on his brother and cousin in running Loews . ( " I can say things to my brother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . ) But he is clearly the man in charge . At first his personality could not seem more different from his father 's . Larry Tisch was a tough , imposing figure . Curt and abrupt , he never said a paragraph when a sentence would suffice , and never uttered a sentence when a word would do . Jimmy , by contrast , is friendly and outgoing . " Larry could enjoy a good joke , " says Lester Pollack , a former general counsel and board member of Loews . " Jimmy can convey a good joke . " Jimmy 's voice is slightly high-pitched , and when he talks , his hands and fingers move swiftly in all directions . He has an easy smile and an infectious laugh , which can burst forth even in the middle of an argument . But in other ways Jimmy Tisch is just like his father . Despite his gregarious nature , when it comes to business he can be as tough as the elder Tisch . He has the same natural instinct for numbers . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But then , why would n't he ? Jimmy Tisch spent 26 years working with his father , picking up almost by osmosis Larry 's core beliefs about business and investing . By now they are in his bones . Larry Tisch was the ultimate value investor . He was a brilliant contrarian : He saw value where other investors didn't-and he was usually right . He avoided anything that seemed remotely like a fad-from the Nifty Fifty stocks of the 1970s to the Internet stocks of the late 1990s . He looked at companies purely by the numbers-as he liked to say , " The numbers do n't lie . " And he thought constantly about risk . " He always wanted to know what the downside was , " says Joe Rosenberg , Loews " chief investment strategist , who worked with Larry for 30 years . " You never went into his office without knowing that-it would be his first question . " Rosenberg adds , " Jimmy 's got Larry 's DNA . " For all the time that they worked together , Larry and Jimmy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely stopped . Recently Jimmy was thinking about buying some stocks in oil-drilling companies . He immediately thought of what kinds of questions his father would ask . Are they cheap enough ? Are you getting a good price ? What could go wrong ? " There have been a number of times when I had an idea , and the first thing I 'd do was pop up to go talk to him and ... , " says Jimmy , pointing to his office wall , behind which his father 's empty office sits . Very abruptly , he stops talking . Finally he says , " Then I think , " He 's not there . ' ' " The story of Larry Tisch started Loews is business legend . In 1946 he and his brother , Bob , borrowed money from their parents to buy Laurel-in-the-Pines , a small hotel in New Jersey . By 1956 they were running a hotel chain that stretched from New York to Miami-and had amassed a multimillion-dollar fortune . Over the next few decades they kept investing in companies , including Loews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name comes from , though the chain was sold in 1985 ) , Lorillard , CNA , and CBS . The companies that made up Loews had nothing in common except this : At the point at which the Tisches bought them , they were seriously undervalued . And over time , under the Tisches ' control , their value rose dramatically . The Tisches ' partnership worked in large part because Larry and Bob were opposites-and they each understood and respected the other 's strengths . " Larry was always the financial end ; I was the sales side , " recalls Bob Tisch , now 78 , who owns the New York Giants and still serves as chairman of Loews . Knowing that Bob would keep the businesses he bought running , Larry was free to focus on what he was really good at : making deals . A classic example was Tisch 's brilliant 1968 purchase of Lorillard , maker of Newport cigarettes . Loews put up no cash for the purchase-but instead used debt and warrants on Loews ' stock to pay for the transaction . Short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an imposing , often intimidating figure . With colleagues and subordinates he could be gruff and brusque . He had no patience for long meetings and never wrote memos . " You always had to know your stuff . If you were bullshitting , he stopped talking , " says Nancy Peretsman , the prominent media banker who worked with Larry and became a Tisch family friend . He was also a fierce competitor in business . Once a company was in his sights , he was remarkably tenacious about getting it . When Tisch went after CNA in 1974 , its management did n't want to sell-and hostile takeovers of insurance companies were virtually unheard of . Marty Lipton , another family friend , who was Loews ' attorney on the deal , tried to talk Larry out of buying it . " I told Larry that it could n't be done . he should n't even try it , " says Lipton . His response : " You want to be my lawyer or not ? " In 1995 , Larry showed his contrarian stripes when , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge London commercial center that had been developed by the Reichmann family . But the Reichmanns had fallen on hard times , and the banks had taken over Canary Wharf . Few other big investors were even willing to look at Canary Wharf-but when Larry saw it , he quickly realized that there was virtually no downside : The rents more than covered his initial $164 million investment . In the subsequent nine years , CNA made more than $750 million through a combination of rental income , dividends , and sales of portions of its stake . ( CNA sold off the final piece this month . ) Larry 's most famous deal , though , was his purchase of CBS in 1985 . For one of the few times in his career , he became the CEO of one of his investments-and got more intimately involved with it than with any other company he 'd ever acquired . From the start he applied his usual discipline-cutting costs and selling off assets . But nobody had ever done that before at a television network , and Tisch became perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote an op-ed piece in the New York Times criticizing CBS management for shutting down news bureaus and laying off news employees . 60 Minutes ' Andy Rooney told the Times that the layoffs were disastrous . Former CBS music chief Walter Yetnikoff referred to Larry as an " evil dwarf . " After Tisch died , the Times , in the very first paragraph of its obituary , said he 'd been " reviled for diminishing what was once the nation 's premier broadcasting network . " For his part , Larry found the criticism bewildering . " He had trouble with some of the entertainment people , " recalls Peretsman . " He could n't understand people who showed up late to work , did drugs , and could n't talk about P &L."; He also believed that if he did n't take corrective action , CBS would wind up in far worse shape . And in that he was probably right . " Larry took a lot of the negative hits for what went on , but the story that got written of that era was n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's CFO at CBS and is now Loews ' CFO . " Larry was ahead of his time . " Indeed , the other major networks , ABC and NBC , ended up making the same kinds of cost cuts CBS did . By the time Tisch sold CBS to Wcstinghousc in 1095 , Loews made a $1.1 billion profit . On Jimmy Tisch 's first day as a full-time employee at Loews , his father brought him into the office of Joe Rosenberg , Larry 's longtime eonsigliere , and asked him to take a half-hour to teach him the business . After that , Larry added , it would be up to Jimmy , then 24 and fresh out of business school , to learn the rest . Larry was only half-kidding-he really did expect his son to pick up things as he went along . In truth , Jimmy and his brothers had been doing that most of their lives . Growing up with Larry Tisch as a father , it was hard not to absorb the Tisch way of doing business . " My father and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That sentiment is echoed by his brother Andrew , who recalls that when he was arrested in college for riding a motorcycle without a helmet , he was too scared to tell his father . But over time , business became an important way for father and sons to relate . From an early age the Tisch children went to work with their fathers . Jimmy spent one vacation baking rolls in the Tisches ' Americana Hotel in Miami . Andrew spent weekends as a child working in the same hotel , filling out guests ' bill forms and filing . His cousin Jonathan spent a summer as a front-desk clerk . " This is how we grew up : watching Bob and Larry , " explains Jonathan . Even at home , business was a part of the young Tisches ' world . Andrew remembers an incident that occurred when he was a teenager : Larry and some cronies were playing bridge in the living room when Andrew walked in to relay a message about one of his father 's business deals . Larry gave him a look ; Andrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , he pulled Andrew into another room . " He said , " You have to be very , very careful because this is information other people should not hear , ' " recalls Andrew . ( Larry 's bridge partners included Bear Stearns ' Alan " Ace " Greenberg , Jimmy Cayne , and on occasion Warren Buffett . ) Rarely , though , were Larry 's lessons conveyed that explicitly . " He never said to me , My expectation of you is going to be this or that , " says Andrew . " He was just good at setting an example and letting me follow . " Says Jimmy : " What my father did was give me enough rope to see what I could do with it . " As the younger Tisches grew up and watched their fathers at work and talked to them about business , Larry and Bob 's business principles became deeply ingrained . By the time they arrived at Loews , they got it . On Jimmy 's first week on the job , for instance , he suggested that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a good value stock-a company whose dividend was higher than its borrowing costs . " He was right , " says Rosenberg . " It would have been a good buy . " Larry said no-not because the idea did n't make sense but because Ma Bell was just too big for Loews to swallow . But the sons were n't just absorbing their fathers ' investing principles . They were also learning how to run a business as a family . Again , it was not something Larry and Bob talked about explicitly . But their example spoke volumes . Larry and Bob had worked out their different roles at Loews without letting sibling rivalries or jealousies interfere . Neither brother tried to trump the other or gain power over the other . Though most people assumed Larry ran the show , both held the title of CEO . Their sons knew they were supposed to act the same way . When Jimmy was still in his 30s , it was clear that he was going to run Loews one day . It is the sort of thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted their roles . Today Andrew oversees Lorillard and Bulova , and Jonathan is in charge of the hotels . And none of the three ever makes a major business decision without consulting the other two . Jimmy came into his own at Loews when Larry was at CBS . There was never any formal announcement declaring that Jimmy was in charge . It just happened . " Larry was gone , so people started going to Jimmy when they had questions or ideas , " explains Rosenberg . It was during this period that Jimmy made his first major acquisition for Loews . In the late ' ' 80s he began buying offshore-oil-drilling rig contractors and grouped them together to form Diamond Offshore . It is now one of the largest offshore-drilling businesses in the world and the third-biggest company in Loews ' portfolio . When Larry returned to Loews full-time in 1995 after the sale of CBS , he did not take back control from his son . " It takes such amazing wisdom to say , " It 's time , " " observes Andrew Tisch . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation has failed to move aside when the junior generation felt it was more than ready , and it destroyed not only the company but the family . " While Larry continued to come into the office every day , he did n't interfere with Jimmy . For his part , Jimmy remained deferential to his father , consulting him on decisions large and small . During the Internet bubble , Larry was convinced that the stock market was overpriced . He decided to short the S &P; 500 . Jimmy , who felt the move was too speculative , argued against it . But he did n't stop his father . Larry , of course , would turn out to be right about the bubble-but too early . His short positions cost Loews $2 billion . One day not long ago , Jimmy Tisch and a handful of Loews executives squeezed themselves into Jimmy 's small office to discuss whether they should make a particular investment . Watching Jimmy , you could see the ways in which he was his father 's son . His main question about the investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chances it will go into bankruptcy ? " he asked . " And if it does , what does that mean for us ? " But you could also see how he 's different . He made the junior staffers feel at ease . He told some jokes . He gave his own opinions but did n't push them on anyone . He asked questions more than he made statements . And when the meeting broke up-with the issue still unresolved-he told the assembled executives that it was up to them to come to a decision . " With Jimmy you can really brainstorm-and talk about things , " remarks Joe Rosenberg . " With Larry you did n't get as much feedback : He was more apt to give one-word answers . " Right now , Jimmy Tisch 's biggest problem as Loews CEO is one of his father 's oldest , and at one time best , investments : CNA Financial . This is Loews ' largest holding , accounting for about 60% of revenues . But lately CNA , the country 's 11th-largest property and casualty company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its reserves have been inadequate to cover unexpected claims that developed in such areas as asbestos liabilities and worker 's compensation . Last year CNA took a $1.8 billion charge to increase its reserves . That charge was the main reason Loews lost $600 million last year . It is critical for Jimmy Tisch to turn CNA around . As long as it 's floundering , Loews will be constrained , primarily because the insurance company is consuming cash that could be deployed more productively . To fix CNA , Jimmy is radically changing the company . In 2002 he brought in a new management team and began a total overhaul of the business . He sold off several subsidiaries , including life insurance , reinsurance , and group insurance . He also cut back on some of the firm 's riskier underwriting . And he 's forking over $750 million of Loews ' money to give CNA time to get back on its feet . Will it be enough ? Jimmy thinks so . " I see growth coming out of CNA , " he says . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was paying out more in claims and expenses than it was generating in premiums ; this year the situation is reversed . " There finally seems to be a glimmer of light at the end of a long tunnel , " says Robert Glasspiegel , an analyst with Langen McAlenney , who covers Loews . Still , it 's far too early to declare victory at CNA . Loews ' second-biggest holding , Lorillard , is also causing headaches . Like all tobacco companies , Lorillard is reeling from litigation woes and pressure from discount cigarette makers . Last year its sales dropped 14% , and net income fell 31% from a year earlier . Recently the bond-rating agency Moody 's gave Loews a negative outlook on its debt , reflecting its " concerns that litigation risk remains significant for its tobacco subsidiary . " Even putting aside the immediate problems , it 's hard to see why this company makes sense in the way it 's now configured . It owns middling businesses in some of the toughest industries around . None of them have anything in common with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90% of its revenues-CNA , Lorillard , and Diamond Offshore-all have publicly traded shares . ( Lorillard trades via a tracking stock , while CNA and Diamond Offshore have a small public float . ) So if you 're an investor , why do you need the umbrella of Loews ? That is precisely the question Jimmy is trying to answer . He obstinately believes that Loews remains a great company ; to hear him tell it , the biggest problem is that no one knows it . To change that , Jimmy is actively courting Wall Street-something his father would never have done . He 's begun holding regular investor meetings . He 's hoping that by the end of the year four more Street analysts will be covering Loews . Currently four do . Ironically , Jimmy portrays Loews as an undervalued stock . At a recent $58 share price , Loews trades at a discount to the value of its parts . Its market cap of $11 billion is roughly equal to the sum of its Big Three : CNA , Lorillard , and Diamond Offshore . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the market 's valuation . By Jimmy 's calculations , the market math is short by $4 billion . He sees a big part of his job now as proving that to Wall Street . So far , he 's had some success-the stock is up 40% in the seven months since his father died . But clearly the larger questions about Loews-and about Jimmy Tisch-go well beyond whether he 'll turn CNA around or get Wall Street back on his side . He 's a smart , sensible businessman ; chances are , he 'll fix Loews ' short-term woes . The real question is long term : What kind of company should Loews be , and how can he get it there ? " When somebody from the outside looks at our businesses , they see them as static , " says Jimmy . " They are not static at all . " He firmly believes that getting the companies back on track-and making shrewd new investments-will make Loews great again . " Our overriding goal is to create shareholder value , " he says . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past 40 years . " He also believes that sticking by his father 's principles is the best way to create that value . " Nothing is going to change about how this company is run , " he says . " I was lucky enough to have a 26-year tutorial with a great CEO . So I want to take the company in a similar direction . " But maybe , to be truly great , Loews needs something more drastic . Like his father , Jimmy wants to do deals only when there are good values to be had . Fair enough . Last year he bought Texas Gas in a classic value play . However , it was also Loews ' first big deal in a decade , and though he hopes to make more acquisitions soon , he 's not going to do a deal just for the sake of doing one . " I have a general rule : If there 's nothing to do , do nothing , " he says . But as long as Jimmy stands pat , Loews will continue to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third-tier insurance company , a drilling company that ebbs and flows as the oil business goes , and so on . The real test for Jimmy Tisch is whether he can honor his father not just by sticking to the old man 's principles , but by finding his own path as well .
