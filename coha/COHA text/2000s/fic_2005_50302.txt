From Claudia O'Keefe 's jaunt into backroads America , we take you now to a small town in a different part of the country , where some people fit in ... and others do n't . Mr. Jacobs , who moved from Manhattan to the Hamptons a few years ago , reports that his story collection My Rose &; My Glove , is due out soon . <p> KOVACHO SANK HIS TEETH into the pliant neck of the girl he 'd met at the library . They 'd struck up a conversation about Romanian poetry and one thing led to another . She was obviously taken with his good looks , seductive accent , and easy manner ; he was pleased with her plump , responsive body and bow lips . They dined together . The girl was so involved with her lamb chops she did n't notice that her new friend never swallowed a single morsel . After dinner , she only hesitated long enough to keep her dignity before agreeing to go to his place for a nightcap . It came as something of a surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightcap . When he had drained the lady dry , Kovacho carried her remains to the trash disposal room down the hall . He had moved from his last address when that city , in an effort to help purify its polluted air , passed a law forbidding the burning of refuse . Damned government interference . Cleansing flames were replaced by compacters . In this new location there were no such restrictions , at least not yet . Bottles , newspapers , and cans were recycled but generic garbage could be stuffed into a bag and thrown down a shaft to the basement crematorium , a civilized and much more satisfying system . Kovacho had some trouble stuffing his kill through the narrow incinerator door - those doors were always too small - but he succeeded by folding her arms over her breasts and pushing hard . He heard the orange fire sputter and hiss with almost as much pleasure over her leftovers as he 'd enjoyed taking his evening nourishment . It was Kovacho 's habit to take a long stroll after dinner . He went back to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash his hands and face and comb his thick , curly hair before setting out to explore his new neighborhood . It was then that he noticed a red stain on the left collar of his white dress shirt . The stain was not much larger than a pinhead but that vermilion dot broke the symmetry of his otherwise perfect outfit . Kovacho was usually a neat eater but the girl was so ripe , so juicy he 'd emptied her ravenously , carelessly , and somehow managed to soil his only shirt with a drop of blood . All his other clothing and sundry possessions were still in transit , clogged into a moving van held up by bad weather somewhere in the Midwest . Kovacho considered his options : to take a stroll as planned or curl up in the bedroom closet of his new apartment , his sanctuary until his casket was delivered along with fresh laundry . He examined the minuscule fleck of blood , dipped a paper towel into soapy water and tried to erase it but failed . In fact , that effort not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collar . Still , it was a tiny imperfection , hard to see even from up close , much less at a distance in darkening streets . He decided to suppress vanity and a touch of paranoia ; his neighbors would n't exactly welcome a resident vampire and certainly not a soiled one . Kovacho found his hat and cane and set out for a brisk walk through the town described in Modern Maturity magazine as " not too big , not too small , an oasis of charming places and smiling faces . " It was a lovely evening . A soft wind blew over the town like angel breath . Kovacho smiled at his reaction to the tranquil town after the bustle of the big city . In a way , he missed the avalanche of noise and galloping crowds but in another way he appreciated the chance to relax his senses , even his guard . He felt as if he 'd found the ideal place to spend at least the balance of the century . He was overdue for some peace and quiet . Peering into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sold clothing , Kovacho could easily see that the woman he 'd met at the library was no exception . The sizes displayed for both sexes clearly showed that the citizens of his oasis were prone to impressive girth ; even the children were shaped like tops and cherubs . There would be no problem satisfying his appetite . Kovacho turned a corner onto a broad avenue . His fellow citizens did not rush along , they moved at a slow , steady pace . Their faces were not angry big city faces , they were relaxed , content faces often with temptingly chubby cheeks mounted on generous necks . Kovacho began to whistle a tune from his childhood . He brimmed with nostalgia wondering where his mother and father were feeding these days ; he had n't seen them in eons . " Excuse me .... " Kovacho was jolted from his reverie by a stringy older man who did n't look to have enough blood for an hors d'oeuvre . " Are you speaking with me ? " Kovacho asked . " I hope you do n't mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might like to know that there 's a small stain on your collar . Something red . I 'd bet a splash of Bordeaux . " " Thank you for telling me , " Kovacho said , wincing . " I 'm Wilbur Fein , Fein Insurance . I do n't recognize you and I pride myself in knowing everyone in town . " Wilbur Fein reached out his spindly hand and Kovacho reluctantly pumped at it . " I know wine can be a problem but I think I have a suggestion . When you get home , let the collar soak in some plain seltzer . I 've seen that technique used on the most delicate fabrics . " " Seltzer , " Kovacho said . " Plain seltzer . Interesting . I appreciate the advice . " " No problem , sir . And if you ever need insurance , as who does n't these days , or if you want to review any policies you have , here , take my card . " Kovacho accepted a small card with raised type and a picture of Wilbur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpected , from volcanoes to sink holes to floods to vampires . And face it , shit happens , fust ask your collar . " Kovacho nodded while Fein laughed . He pocketed the fancy card and walked along as quickly as possible , leaving his new acquaintance waving a fond farewell . " Seltzer . Works miracles , " Fein said . " Beautiful shirt . A shame if it 's ruined . Wine has its downside but , hey , let 's not forget the good side , eh ? Vinny Ventas , eh ? " " Oh , yes , " Kovacho said , watching what he considered the well-meaning idiot vanish around a corner . He suddenly salivated though he was n't the least bit hungry , certainly not tempted by Wilbur Fein . The Pavlovian response was triggered by the sight of a tall , blonde woman crossing the street , walking toward him . It had been a while since Kovacho dined on a mature lady , that combination of beauty , brains , and wisdom that rivaled any James Beard recipe . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled back , convinced that she had him confused with someone else . " Good evening , " the tempting Amazonian said . Kovacho grinned at her , a bit shy in the presence of such grace and radiance . " I know I have no right to offer gratuitous advice to a perfect stranger but I could n't help but hear Mr. Fein do the same . I wanted to tell you about Exit(TM) , a marvelous new stain remover on sale this week at the A &.P.; It disappeared an awful blotch of Merlot from my white carpet with one application . But now that I 'm standing so close to you , I suspect the stain is n't wine at all . " " Not wine ? " Kovacho said feeling a ripple of anxiety . " What then ? " " Ketchup , " the woman said . " Or some kind of tomato sauce . And I ca n't vouch for Exit(TM) 's effectiveness against ketchup since I 've never tried it . " " Yes , " Kovacho said , " you 're absolutely right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not a drinker - and , yes , it could be Heinz Tomato Ketchup(TM) or possibly marinara sauce since I did come in contact with both an order of French fries at lunch , shame on me , and spaghetti and meatballs at dinner . And I do very much appreciate your interest in the plight of a perfect or even imperfect stranger . " " Think nothing of it , " the lady said . " We 're very friendly in this town . Often to the point of trampling on privacy . Well .... " " I was thinking , " Kovacho said , " without being too forward , that you might share your telephone number . Perhaps we can get better acquainted over a cup of coffee some enchanted evening . " " You are a smoothie , " the woman said . " On close inspection , I think definitely ketchup . " Then she wrote her telephone number on a piece of paper from a spiral pad she carried in her purse . " I 'd be interested to know how Exit(TM) worked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 'd call it a smudge ? " " Marginal between a stain and a smudge , " the woman said . " By the way , my name is Angela . I look forward to hearing from you , Mr .... " " Kovacho . Kovach Kovacho . It 's Romanian . " " Ah , a vampire , " Angela said . " Cancel that remark . An old joke . " When they parted , Kovacho made a mental note to consider Angela for Sunday dinner . He frequently had Chinese food on Sundays but thought a change might do him good . It would n't be easy getting Angela past the incinerator door , she was a formidable package , but it could be fun to take on the challenge . " Wine . Ketchup . What a town , " Kovacho whispered to the night . " Such cheerful buttinskies . " He wondered how much inbreeding contributed to the busybody mindset . He went on his way after tucking Angela 's phone number into an inside pocket , passing a few locals without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the usual stress of honking horns and pushy crowds , tonguing flecks of the ample girl that had lodged between his lower teeth , settling back into the lull of twilight , he felt a tug at his right pants leg . He thought it was a dog . He hated dogs and they returned the enmity ; dogs knew too much . But it was no dog , it was a child , a melon of a lad , staring up at Kovacho 's angry face . " Release my trousers , young man , " he said , looking around for some mother or father or supervisor , whoever had let go of the leash . " Mister , there 's cherry cough syrup on your collar . What is it , Robitussin(TM) ? You have a chest cold , right ? So do I. " The child coughed up a spasm of phlegm and spit it on the sidewalk . " Fever too . No school tomorrow . " He inhaled a long wheeze . " I have no cold , " Kovacho said , wondering why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not from cough syrup . Now go away . You seem infectious . You should be in bed swallowing penicillin . " " He barfed a tablespoon of the stuff on his blanket . Henry 's bed looks like a scene out of a horror movie . " A short , square woman in tight slacks caught the boy in a near headlock . " He 's so friendly , " she said . " I 'm his aunt . He lives with me . You 're probably wondering what happened to my sister , his mother . We do n't know . She just upped and left with a Buddhist who ran an exercise class . And his father ? Who can say . Henry is n't usually out this late , believe me , but I needed to do some shopping and I could n't leave him home alone . " " I understand , " Kovacho said . " Being a substitute single parent is no fun , let me tell you . But somebody 's got to do it . He saw your wee red stain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No matter . " " I hope you wo n't catch his flu . I suggest you stock up on zinc lozenges , extract of echinacea , and rose hips tea . " " I love that name , rose hips . Refulgent , " Kovacho said . " Huh ? " the lady said . " Nothing . A word I happen to like . " " Henry had a point though . It does look like cherry cough syrup . " " It is n't . " " If it turns out to be Robitussin(TM) , try old-fashioned Clorox(TM) and a hot wash in Tide(TM) . Set your drier on medium heat . You do n't want the shirt to shrink to a handkerchief . " She laughed . " Forgive me . I get carried away . " " All is forgiven , " Kovacho said , " and thank you for your concern . " Henry wheezed again , a long , painful note worthy of John Cage . Kovacho shuddered . He hated bacteria and microbes , anything microscopic like body dander , and feared the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week spewing glue and snot in a miasmal cloud of droplets . " If it ai n't cherry cough syrup , he must be a vampire , " the boy said , gagging on the liquefied putrefaction that escaped his lungs . " Henry , " his aunt said . " Apologize to this man at once . " " It does n't matter , " Kovacho said . " Good evening , then . I hope your nephew feels better very soon . " He finished the sentence silently : though I would like to watch horned owls rip out his intestines . " Get me a sharp piece of wood or a silver bullet , " Henry said . " Silver bullets are for werewolves , you dunce , " Kovacho said . " We do n't talk to our children in that manner , " the aunt said . She grabbed the boy under an arm and dragged him away . A block farther up the avenue , a homeless man held out his hand toward Kovacho . " Let me guess . Beets , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beet sauce on your collar ? " " I dislike beets , " Kovacho said . " And I have no loose change . " " Those fancy pistachio nuts ? " the man said . " Do they still dye them ? I heard the red dye they use on the shells can give you a cancer . " " I do n't know , " Kovacho said , " I have n't had anything to do with pistachio nuts since I developed an allergy . I break out . " " You know what works wonders ? Vodka . Not the designer brands . The stuff they hide on the bottom shelf . Of course , there 's always Whisk(TM) or Zout Oxy(TM) . But you ca n't swallow the leftovers . " Kovacho turned abruptly and headed home . His quiet walk had turned into a nightmare ; he felt as if the minuscule stain had swelled to the size of a beacon crowning a lighthouse . When he reached the corner , an old lady leaned out of a Studebaker sedan waiting at a stoplight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of year ? There 's nothing I enjoy more than a ripe raspberry though I am suspicious of the ones from places like Chile or Peru . I saw a documentary that said they use fertilizer made from human waste . So much for NAFTA . I see by your shirt that you 've been at the raspberries , unless you 're a vampire , ha ha , so if you know of a market selling them , I would be grateful for the information . I mean fresh berries , not that jam without seeds . " The light changed to green and a barrage of horns forced the ancient driver to roll along before Kovacho could say anything . A few feet from his house , Kovacho was blocked by a young couple filling the space between a tree and a neighboring building . They were in a passionate embrace . Kovacho listened to the music of their moans , experiencing a flood of nostalgia , a deluge of memories of sweet , soft companions who had helped him through the most difficult of nights before he drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said after a few minutes . " There 's a puddle in the gutter and I really do n't wish to soak my socks and shoes . You see , my clothes are en route , stalled on a highway out there in the great beyond , so if I step off into that sludgy lake I would have nothing to wear tomorrow . " There was a pop as the couple separated , their suction broken by the sudden withdrawal . The girl had a warm , puppy face with large eyes , a neat nose , a lovely mouth , perky breasts , slender legs and the kind of rose hips that might really cure the flu . She had a short , tight haircut , almost military , that hugged her skull . In contrast , her man was a hairy ball that reminded Kovacho of a baby 's toy , something to cuddle in a crib or playpen . His entire head was a bush of hair and a sprawl of beard . The only other visible part of him was a pair of furry wrists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his shirt , " the man said . " Red ink . " " I see , " the girl said . " Are you thinking what I 'm thinking ? " " Damn right , " the man said . " So who is it you work for ? FBI ? CIA ? Secret Service ? Or do you just like to hang around the library censoring phrases , sentences , paragraphs , whole pages because it amuses you ? " " He might be IRS , " the girl said . " I think not , " the man said . " He does n't smell like an accountant . But just for the record , do you doctor books for some major corporation or just screw over the little guys trying to make it against the odds ? " " Please let me pass , " Kovacho said . " I 'm coming down with something and I need to get to my medication . " " He 's a publisher , " the man said . " So whose manuscript did you decimate today ? Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , " Kovacho said . " In fact , I just moved here from .... " " Oh , " the girl said , " watch out , darling . He 's having a movement . " " Enough is enough , " the man said . " We 're behaving like adolescent fools . Hey , mister , we were just having some fun is all . And I do have a suggestion about the red ink . Salt water , a little flour , lemon , and oregano . It should get rid of that blot . " " Blot ? " Kovacho said . " Unless it 's not red ink . Unless you 're a vampire , " the man said . " Yuk yuk . " " He does have that thirsty look they have in George Romero movies , " the girl said . " Whose blood is that dribble on your shirt ? Anybody I knew ? " " Dribble ? " Kovacho said . " Let him get past , " the man said . " You 'll have him yelling for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the girl said . " When you get home , put a Turkish towel around your head , boil up water in a kettle , and inhale the steam . That opens the passages . Moisture is the key . hot and wet . " " Get a room , " Kovacho said , pushing between them . On the staircase leading to his floor , Kovacho was blocked again , this time by a rotund figure so androgynous as to make genre identification impossible . The person , gasping from the effort of carrying a huge bag of bottles and cans , had a man 's face but skin smooth as a nun 's . " ' Scuse , please , " the person said . " I 'm your super . You 're the one who just moved into 3B , the one whose name sounds like a vegetable ? " " I am Mr. Kovacho from 3B , correct . Perhaps if you lift the bag and inhale to the maximum and if I slide along the banister .... " " My name is Bromovich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need anything , let me know . " " What I need is enough air space to pass , " Kovacho said . " I 'm trying to get to my apartment . " " No need to get snappy , " the super said , breathing in a high percentage of the available oxygen in the stairwell , flattening the substantial belly as much as possible . Kovacho managed to inch his way around the mound as the super exhaled a small hurricane . " Your shirt is messed up , you know that ? Looks to me like wine , ketchup , cough syrup , the dye they used to use on pistachio nuts , or maybe good old red ink unless you cut yourself shaving or worse case scenario you happen to be a vampire . Or should I say vanpire ? I understand your furniture has n't been delivered yet . Whatever the stain is , it is ugly , like a mole , if you do n't mind my saying so . When that happens to me I whip up a mix of soap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shot of vodka ? Then I mix in a few drops of Wash Away(TM) and take a few swipes with a Spray " n " Wash Stain Stick(TM) . It 's like a miracle . " Kovacho nodded and hurried upstairs . He looked around the empty rooms of his new nest and examined the closet where he 'd have to sleep until his proper bed arrived . He thought about the town he had chosen , this oasis of charming places and smiling faces . Every one of the smiling faces had mentioned vampires . That showed an unexpected degree of sophistication . Or were they watching too much television ? It took Kovacho only minutes before he decided to leave this promised " island of tranquility " to get back to Manhattan , the island he 'd escaped , the indifferent city , dirty city , crowded city , arrogant city , but a city embracing difference , tolerant of bum piss , pigeon droppings , shrieks frozen in graffiti , curses carved into sidewalk cement and stains on ruffled shirts . He would call the moving company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Breaking his lease might present some legal problems but even if it cost a few months " rent it was well worth it . This was simply not his town . Kovacho looked at the red pinpoint on his collar in a bathroom mirror . That stain would never come out ; his favorite shirt would never be the same . Kovacho stripped off his clothes and climbed into the bedroom closet , pulling the door closed behind him .
