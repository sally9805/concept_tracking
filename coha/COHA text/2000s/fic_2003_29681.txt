Prologue Let 's Play Make-Believe New Jersey , near Princeton ; March 1932 The Charles Lindbergh farmhouse glowed with bright , orangish lights . It looked like a fiery castle , especially in that gloomy , fir wooded region of Jersey . Shreds of misty fog touched the boy as he moved closer and closer to his first moment of real glory , his first kill . It was pitch-dark and the grounds were soggy and muddy and thick with puddles . He had anticipated as much . He 'd planned for everything , including the weather . He wore a size nine man 's work boot . The toe and heel of the boots were stuffed with torn cloth and strips of the Philadelphia Inquirer . He wanted to leave footprints , plenty of footprints . A man 's footprints . Not the prints of a twelve-year-old boy . They would lead from the county highway called the Stoutsburg-Wertsville Road , up to , then back from , the farmhouse . He began to shiver as he reached a stand of pines , not thirty yards from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he 'd imagined : seven bedrooms and four baths on the second floor alone . Lucky Lindy and Anne Morrow 's place in the country . Cool beans , he thought . The boy inched closer and closer toward the dining-room window . He was fascinated by this condition known as fame . He thought a lot about it . Almost all the time . What was fame really like ? How did it smell ? How did it taste ? What did fame look like close up ? " The most popular and glamorous man in the world " was right there , sitting at the table . Charles Lindbergh was tall , elegant , and fabulously golden haired , with a fair complexion . " LuckyLindy " truly seemed above everyone else . So did his wife , Anne Morrow Lindbergh . Anne had short hair . It was curly and black , and it made her skin look chalky white . The light from the candles on the table appeared to be dancing around her . Both of them sat very straight in their chairs . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's special gifts to the world . They kept their heads high , delicately eating their food . He strained to see what was on the table . It looked like lamb chops on their perfect china . " I 'll be more famous than either of you pitiful stiffs , " the boy finally whispered . He promised that to himself . Every detail had been thought through a thousand times , at least that often . He very methodically went to work . The boy retrieved a wooden ladder left near the garage by workingmen . Holding the ladder tightly against his side , he moved toward a spot just beyond the library window . He climbed silently up to the nursery . His pulse was racing , and his heart was pounding so loud he could hear it . Light cast from a hallway lamp illuminated the baby 's room . He could see the crib and the snoozing little prince in it . Charles Jr. , " the most famous child on earth . " On one side , to keep away drafts , was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sly and cunning . " Here comes Mr. Fox , " the boy whispered as he quietly slid open the window . Then he took another step up the ladder and was inside the nursery at last . Standing over the crib , he stared at the princeling . Curls of golden hair like his father 's , but fat . Charles Jr . was gone to fat at only twenty months . The boy could no longer control himself Hot tears streamed from his eyes . His whole body began to shake , from frustration and rageonly mixed with the most incredible joy of his life . " Well , daddy 's little man . It 's our time now , " he muttered to himself . He took a tiny rubber ball with an attached elastic band from his pocket . He quickly slipped the odd-looking looped device over Charles Jr . ' s head , just as the small blue eyes opened . As the baby started to cry , the boy plopped the rubber ball right into the little drooly mouth . He reached down into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiftly back down the ladder . All according to plan . The boy ran back across the muddy fields with the precious , struggling bundle in his arms and disappeared into the darkness . Less than two miles from the farmhouse , he buried the spoiled-rotten Lindbergh babyburied him alive . That was only the start of things to come . After all , he was only a boy himself . He , not Bruno Richard Hauptmann , was the Lindbergh baby kidnapper . He had done it all by himself . Cool beans . EARLY ON THE MORNING of December 21 , 1992 , I was the picture of contentment on the sun porch of our house on 5th Street in Washington , D.C. The small , narrow room was cluttered with mildewing winter coats , work boots , and wounded children 's toys . I could n't have cared less . This was home . I was playing Gershwin on our slightly out-of-tune , formerly grand piano . It was just past 5 A.M. , and cold as a meat locker on the porch . I was prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The phone jangled in the kitchen . Maybe I 'd won the D.C. , or Virginia , or Maryland lottery and they 'd forgotten to call the night before . I play all three games of misfortune regularly . " Nana ? Can you get that ? " I called from the porch . " It 's for you . You might as well get it yourself , " my testy grandmother called back . " No sense me gettin ' up , too . No sense means nonsense in my dictionary . " That 's not exactly what was said , but it went something like that . It always does . I hobbled into the kitchen , sidestepping more toys on morning-stiff legs . I was thirty-eight at the time . As the saying goes , if I 'd known I was going to live that long , I would have taken better care of myself . The call turned out to be from my partner in crime , John Sampson . Sampson knew I 'd be up . Sampson knows me better than my own kids . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't you ? " he said . No other I.D . was necessary . Sampson and I have been best friends since we were nine years old and took up shoplifting at Park 's Corner Variety store near the projects . At the time , we had no idea that old Park would have shot us dead over a pilfered pack of Chesterfields . Nana Mama would have done even worse to us if she 'd known about our crime spree . " If I was n't up , I am now , " I said into the phone receiver . " Tell me something good . " " There 's been another murder . Looks like our boy again , " Sampson said . " They 're waitin ' on us . Half the free world 's there already . " " It 's too early in the morning to see the meat wagon , " I muttered . I could feel my stomach rolling . This was n't the way I wanted the day to start . " St. Fk me . " Nana Mama looked up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of her sanctimonious , lady-of-the-house looks . She was already dressed for school , where she still does volunteer work at seventy-nine . Sampson continued to give me gory details about the day 's first homicides . " Watch your language , Alex , " Nana said . " Please watch your language so long as you 're planning to live in this house . " " I 'll be there in about ten minutes , " I told Sampson . " I own this house , " I said to Nana . She groaned as if she were hearing that terrible news for the first time . " There 's been another bad murder over in Langley Terrace . It looks like a thrill killer . I 'm afraid that it is , " I told her . " That 's too bad , " Nana Mama said to me . Her soft brown eyes grabbed mine and held . Her white hair looked like one of the doilies she puts on all our living-room chairs . " That 's such a bad part of what the politicians have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to move out of Washington , Alex . " " Sometimes I think the same thing , " I said , " but we 'll probably tough it out . " " Yes , black people always do . We persevere . We always suffer in silence . " " Not always in silence , " I said to her . I had already decided to wear my old Harris Tweed jacket . It was a murder day , and that meant I 'd be seeing white people . Over the sport coat , I put on my Georgetown warm-up jacket . It goes better with the neighborhood . On the bureau , by the bed , was a picture of Maria Cross . Three years before , my wife had been murdered in a drive-by shooting . That murder , like the majority of murders in Southeast , had never been solved . I kissed my grandmother on the way out the kitchen door . We 've done that since I was eight years old . We also say good-bye , just in case we never see each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , ever since Nana Mama first took me in and decided she could make something of me . She made a homicide detective , with a doctorate in psychology , who works and lives in the ghettos of Washington , D.C. I AM OFFICIALLY a Deputy Chief of Detectives , which , in the words of Shakespeare and Mr. Faulkner , is a lot of sound and fury , signifying nada . The title should make me the number six or seven person in the Washington Police Department . It does n't . People wait for my appearance at crime scenes in D.C. , though . A trio of D.C. Metro blue-and-whites were parked helter-skelter in front of 41-15 Benning Road . A crime-lab van with blackened windows had arrived . So had an EMS ambulance . MORTUARY was cheerfully stenciled on the door . There were a couple of fire engines at the murder house . The neighborhood 's ambulance-chasers , mostly eye-fking males , were hanging around . Older women with winter coats thrown over their pajamas and nightgowns , and pink and blue curlers in their hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The row house was dilapidated clapboard , painted a gaudy Caribbean blue . An old Chevette with a broken , taped-up side window looked as if it had been abandoned in the driveway . " Fk this . Let 's go back to bed , " Sampson said . " I just remembered what this is going to be like . I hate this job lately . " " I love my work , love Homicide , " I said with a sneer . " See that ? There 's the M.E. already in his plastic suit . And there are the crime lab boys . And who 's this coming our way now ? " A white sergeant in a puffy blue-black parka with a fur collar came waddling up to Sampson and me as we approached the house . Both his hands were jammed in his pockets for warmth . " Sampson ? Uh , Detective Cross ? " The sergeant cracked his lower jaw the way some people do when they 're trying to clear their ears in airplanes . He knew exactly who we were . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chops . " Wuz up , man ? " Sampson does n't like his chops being busted very much . " Senior Detective Sampson , " I answered the sergeant . " I 'm Deputy Chief Cross . " The sergeant was a jelly-roll-belly Irish type , probably left over from the Civil War . His face looked like a wedding cake left out in the rain . He did n't seem to be buying my tweed jacket ensemble . " Everybody 's freezin ' their toches off , " he wheezed . " That 's wuz up . " " You could probably lose a little of them toches , " Sampson advised him . " Might give Jenny Craig a call . " " Fk you , " said the sergeant . It was nice to meet the white Eddie Murphy . " Master of the riposte . " Sampson grinned at me . " You hear what he said ? Fk you ? " Sampson and I are both physical . We work out at the gym attached to St. Anthony'sSt . A 's . Together , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we want to . Sometimes it 's necessary in our line of work . I 'm only six three . John is six nine and growing . He always wears Wayfarer sunglasses . Sometimes he wears a raggy Kangol hat , or a yellow bandanna . Some people call him " John-John " because he 's so big he could be two Johns . We walked past the sergeant toward the murder house . Our elite task force team is supposed to be above this kind of confrontation . Sometimes we are . A couple of uniforms had already been inside the house . A nervous neighbor had called the precinct around four-thirty . She thought she 'd spotted a prowler . The woman had been up with the night hitters . It comes with the neighborhood . The two uniformed patrolmen found three bodies inside . When they called it in , they were instructed to wait for the Special Investigator Team . S.I.T . It 's made up of eight black officers supposedly slated for better things in the department . The outside door to the kitchen was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The doors of every house have a unique sound when they open and close . This one whined like an old man . It was pitch-black in the house . Eerie . The wind was sucked through the open door , and I could hear something rattling inside . " We did n't turn on the lights , sir , " one of the uniforms said from behind me . " You 're Dr. Cross , right ? " I nodded . " Was the kitchen door open when you came ? " I turned to the patrolman . He was white , baby-faced , growing a little mustache to compensate for it . He was probably twenty-three or twenty-four , real frightened that morning . I could n't blame him . " Uh . No . No sign of forced entry . It was unlocked , sir . " The patrolman was very nervous . " It 's a real bad mess in there , sir . It 's a family . " One of the patrolmen switched on a powerful milled-aluminum flashlight and we all peered inside the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lime green vinyl chairs . A black Bart Simpson clock was on one wall . It was the kind you see in the front windows of all the People 's drugstores . The smells of Lysol and burnt grease melded into something strange to the nose , though not entirely unpleasant . There were a lot worse smells in homicide cases . Sampson and I hesitated , taking it all in the way the murderer might have just a few hours earlier . " He was right here , " I said . " He came in through the kitchen . He was here , where we 're standing . " " Do n't talk like that , Alex , " Sampson said . " Sound like Jeane Dixon . Creep me out . " No matter how many times you do this kind of thing , it never gets easier . You do n't want to have to go inside . You do n't want to see any more horrible nightmares in your lifetime . " They 're upstairs , " the cop with the mustache said . He filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Sanders . Two women and a small boy . His partner , a short , well-built black man , had n't said a word yet . His name was Butchie Dykes . He was a sensitive young cop I 'd seen around the station . The four of us entered the death house together . We each took a deep breath . Sampson patted my shoulder . He knew that child homicide had me shook . The three bodies were upstairs in the front bedroom , just off the top of the stairs . There was the mother , Jean " Poo " Sanders , thirty-two . Even in death , her face was haunting . She had big brown eyes , high cheekbones , full lips that had already turned purplish . Her mouth was stretched open in a scream . Poo 's daughter , Suzette Sanders , fourteen years on this earth . She was just a young girl but had been prettier than her mother . She wore a mauve ribbon in her braided hair and a tiny nose earring to prove she was older than her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A baby son , Mustaf Sanders , three years old , was lying face up , and his little cheeks seemed stained with tears . He was wearing a " pajama bag " like my own kids wear . Just as Nana Mama had said , it was a bad part of what somebody had let become a bad city . In this big bad country of ours . The mother and the daughter were bound to an imitation brass bedpost . Satin underwear , black and red mesh stockings , and flowery bed sheets had been used to tie them up . I took out the pocket recorder I carry and began to put down my first observations . " Homicide cases H234 914 through 916 . A mother , teenage daughter , little boy . The women have been slashed with something extremely sharp . A straight razor , possibly . " Their breasts have been cut off . The breasts are nowhere to be found . The pubic hair of the women has been shaved . There are multiple stab wounds , what the pathologists call ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blood , fecal matter . I believe the two women , both the mother and daughter , were prostitutes . I 've seen them around . " My voice was a low drone . I wondered if I 'd be able to understand all the words later . " The little boy 's body seems to have been casually tossed aside . Mustaf Sanders has on hand-me-down pajamas that are covered with Care Bears . He is a tiny , incidental pile in the room . " I could n't help grieving as I looked down at the little boy , his sad , lifeless eyes staring up at me . Everything was very noisy inside my head . My heart ached . Poor little Mustaf , whoever you were . " I do n't believe he wanted to kill the boy , " I said to Sampson . " He or she . " " Or it . " Sampson shook his head . " I vote for it . It 's a Thing , Alex . The same Thing that did Condon Terrace earlier this week . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
