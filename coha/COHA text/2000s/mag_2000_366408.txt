Shortly after formally agreeing on a new government , Jorg Haider returned to his rooftop office overlooking Vienna 's Parliament buildings and spoke to TIME 's Andrew Purvis and Angela Leuker . <P> TIME : How do you account for the strength of the E.U. response to the Freedom Party entering government ? <P> Haider : I expected a wave of protest . The more successful we have been , the more the socialist party organized the protest around the world against us . They told terrible stories . <P> TIME : In the past you praised Hitler 's employment policies and former members of the Waffen SS . Do you still hold those views ? <P> Haider : I have made some mistakes in the past , and I regret this , and I apologize for having wounded people . I have made it clear that the Freedom Party has a clear distance from all ideas like nationalism , national socialism and so on . <P> TIME : Why did you praise Hitler 's employment policies ? <P> Haider : I think it was only one sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sentence and made a campaign against me , and it was not possible for me to explain myself . <P> TIME : What about your praise of the former Waffen SS ? <P> Haider : At the time when I was speaking , I did n't know who was in the audience . I did n't know there were Waffen SS veterans . <P> TIME : Do you agree that Austria has n't come to terms with World War II ? <P> Haider : For a long period after the end of World War II , the two predominant political parties tried to reduce responsibility for the past . They said Austria was not responsible at all . But we have victims and perpetrators . We were sitting on both sides .
