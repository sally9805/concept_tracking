Chapter One Rural Sussex , England , 1812 ... You have a visitor . " " Who ? " Margaret Gray removed her bonnet and hung it on the hook by the door . She 'd spent the day at the school she 'd started in an abandoned cottage at the edge of the property . After walking home in the bright May sunshine , she blinked several times , her vision adjusting to the dim foyer . " I do n't know who it is , " her cousin , sixteen-year-old Penelope Gray , sneered . " Is it a man or a woman ? " " A man . " At relaying the peculiar and somewhat frightening news Penelope was rippling with a cruel curiosity , eager to view Margaret 's reaction , so Margaret concealed any piqued interest . After suffering through years of Penelope 's malicious gossip and petty slights , Margaret was an expert at pretending not to care what the horrid child said or did . Margaret frowned . " Why would he wish to see me ? " " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's considering marrying you . He 's come to discuss it with Lavinia ! " Lavinia was Penelope 's mother , but there was little affection between the two , and Penelope referred to her mother by her Christian name . They had a tempestuous relationship that resembled battling siblings , and Margaret had spent her entire life caught between them as they fought like cats trapped in a sack . " He 's investigating a marriage to me ? " At the ludicrous idea Margaret scoffed . " You ca n't be serious . " " You think I 'm lying ? " " No . You had to have misunderstood . " " Hah ! The butler specifically said the man plans to meet Miss Gray . " Margaret 's alarm calmed significantly . " Penelope Gray , he 's here to meet you . " Penelope gasped . " Me ! " " Yes , you . Why would you automatically assume the butler meant me ? " " Lavinia would never contemplate a match without mentioning it to me . " " Would n't she ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She turned toward the small mirror hanging behind her and primped her perfect curls . " Besides , you 're aware that I 'm off to London for the Season . I 'm to find my husband in town-after I 've made all the other girls green with envy . " " Maybe Lavinia decided to save her money and cut to the chase . She continually harangues about the cost . Perhaps she 's skipped the middle part of the process and jumped straight to the end . " " She would n't do it without telling me ! " Penelope insisted . Staving off a full-blown argument , Margaret held up a hand . " Fine . I 'm sure you 're correct . " " Of course , I am . I 'm always right . " " Yes , you are . " " You 're just jealous that I 'm going to London and not you . " " Absolutely . " " You hate it that I 'm rich , and you 're not , " Penelope charged . " I 'm completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you 're old . " " I am . I am . I 'm twenty-five and positively decrepit . I have n't two farthings to rub together . " In a dramatic gesture , Margaret laid a wrist on her forehead . " Oh , woe is me ! " Penelope glowered , trying to discern if Margaret was being sarcastic , and Margaret struggled to keep from laughing . She 'd sat through hundreds of conversations about Penelope 's debut , and she was sick of the calculating . Penelope 's departure for London was six weeks away , and in the interim , the prospects for incessant marital plotting were maddening . " You can joke all you want , " Penelope sniped . " Let 's see who marries first , shall we ? " " There 's no doubt it will be you and that you 'll be fabulously happy . " Margaret had no illusions . Though she would love to have a home and family of her own , it would never happen . She was an orphan who 'd come to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After his death , her aunt Lavinia had allowed her to stay on , but as Lavinia constantly stated , Margaret subsisted on Lavinia 's charity . Marriage would never be a possibility . Penelope spun to go , cackling like a witch as she stomped out , declaring , " You and your suitor will have a lot in common . He 's old , too , and ugly as a crone . And he 's a murderer ! " Margaret sighed . With her blond hair and blue eyes , her petite height and rounded figure , Penelope was very fetching , but it was sad that so much spite could be contained in such a pretty package . She could be charming and gay , but also ruthless and intolerable . In many ways , she was Lavinia 's twin . Margaret was tired of both women , and she would give anything to move away and start over in a new place . She wished fairy tales were real , that she could swallow a magic potion and be altered into a different person with a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants ' stairs and tiptoed to her room . She was certain that Penelope had been lying about a gentleman caller , but what if Lavinia had actually approached someone ? The notion-of Lavinia selecting Margaret 's spouse-was disturbing . Lavinia kept hinting that they were broke , that after Penelope 's entre into Society , there 'd be nothing left . For months , she 'd been slyly commenting about how she was weary of supporting Margaret , and Margaret had ignored the remarks , but what if Lavinia had been serious ? What if she demanded that Margaret wed ? Still , Margaret yearned to marry , so she would n't summarily discount any suggestion from Lavinia . Even if the man was elderly and unattractive , as Penelope claimed , he might be kind and courteous . Most important , as her husband , he would take her away from Gray 's Manor , and she would be the mistress of her own home . Her heart pounding with excitement and trepidation , she went into the dressing room to wash . If Lavinia sent for her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mirror , she stripped down to chemise and petticoat . She pulled the combs from her hair , and the lengthy mass swooshed down . It was a thick , rich auburn , her eyes a vibrant green , and in a world where everyone was pale and fair , she was a definite oddity . She was slender , neither tall nor short , and her face had arched brows , a pert nose , and a generous mouth , but after enduring nearly two decades of Lavinia 's criticisms , she 'd accepted that she was very average . When she noticed herself pining for it to be otherwise-that she be a great beauty with dozens of swains , instead of a lonely , ordinary woman with foibles and flaws-she chuckled at her whimsy . What was she doing , bared to her undergarments and moping in front of the mirror ? She could n't change who she was . She proceeded to the washstand , swished a cloth , and was swabbing it across her arms when a male voice murmured , " Very nice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd really heard a man speak , that it was n't her imagination . " Turn around , " he said . " Let me see all of you . " There was someone in the room with her ! She was about to whip around and challenge him when she remembered that she was practically naked . She glared over her shoulder , ready to chastise , but she was so stunned that she was speechless . The man loitering in the threshold was incredibly handsome . He was a few years older than herself , probably thirty or so , and he was tall and muscular , his chest broad , his waist narrow , his legs ridiculously long . His hair was dark , almost black , and his eyes were a shrewd , piercing blue , the color she envisioned the Mediterranean to be . Obviously , he 'd been traveling . His jacket was dusty , his boots scuffed , his hair windblown . He smelled like sweat and horses and another scent that was more subtle , that she suspected was his very essence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and why are you in my room ? " " Funny , " he replied , " but I could have sworn it was my room-at least that 's what a footman told me a few minutes ago . So I might ask the same : Why are you in here ? " " I am bathing . " " And I am watching you . " Margaret was frantic , but secretly thrilled , too . He had to be the mysterious guest Penelope had mentioned , but he was too charismatic , too dynamic , too ... too ... everything . He was like a prince in a storybook , like a statue in a museum . Lavinia did n't have a humane bone in her body , so he could n't be the man she 'd invited to Gray 's Manor . She would never have done something so wonderful . Margaret 's dressing room was connected to the adjoining bedchamber , but no one was ever housed there . Visitors were lodged in the other wing , closer to Lavinia and Penelope . Who had located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping to have Margaret ruined ? Was she planning to burst in and discover Margaret in a compromising situation ? Lavinia must have felt the need to force an encounter , but in light of the man 's godlike countenance , why would Lavinia presume that Margaret would hesitate ? What was wrong with him ? Was he deranged ? Was he a wife-beater ? Penelope had said he was a murderer . Whom had he killed ? His prior wives ? " You 've made a horrible mistake , " she advised . " Get out at once . " " I do n't think so . " " I must confer with the housekeeper to have you moved . I ca n't do it while you 're standing there . " " Ca n't you ? " " No . " " Lavinia insisted you were very friendly . Why be shy ? " He was amused by her predicament , and she yearned to strangle him . " I 'm not decent-as you can plainly see-and if you were any sort of gentleman , you 'd do as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he responded . " I 'm not a gentleman and never have been . " He took a step toward her , then another , and she wanted to retreat , but she was trapped in the corner . Short of knocking him down , she could n't escape . " Aah ! " she shrieked , spinning toward the wall . " Will you go away ? " " No . " He kept coming till he was directly behind her , and she panicked , not certain of what he meant to do . She did n't sense any menace or threat , so she was n't afraid for her physical safety , but she 'd had scant dealings with men , so she could n't figure out what he intended . Without warning , he snuggled himself to her backside , his hands on her waist , and the scandalous contact was so marvelous that she worried she might faint . She had n't known that a man 's touch would be so hot , so strong . She actually shivered-not with outrage or shock as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you mad ? " she sputtered . " I 've frequently heard people say that I am . " So ... that was why Lavinia had chosen him . He was demented . Lavinia was about to pawn her off on a lunatic ! She elbowed him in the ribs , but the paltry blow had no effect . " Get out of here before someone stumbles in and sees us . " " I do n't care if we 're caught . We would n't have to make any decisions ; they 'd be made for us . " His fingers were lean and crafty , and he was caressing them in slow circles , stroking down her flanks , then up again . The motion was so hypnotic that she could scarcely keep from purring like a kitten . " You smell good , " he said . " Release me this second ! " " No . " He was riffling through her hair , assessing weight and texture . " This auburn is such an interesting color . I was so sure you 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You haven't-yet . " " I will eventually . " " I 'm positive you 're correct . " He was resigned , sounding as if he 'd been let down so often that he expected the worst from everyone . He bent down and kissed her shoulder , his teeth nipping at her nape and sending goose bumps down her arms and legs . The soft feel of his mouth on her bare skin was too arousing to be believed . Forgetting her dishabille , she wiggled away and whirled to face him , and he towered over her , his huge , masculine form taking up so much space that she was dizzy and off balance . " What are you doing ? " she demanded . " Making love to you . Ca n't you tell ? " She was a sheltered spinster , for pity 's sake . How was she supposed to know ? " No , I ca n't tell . " " Then I must be out of practice . " Amusement flickered in his expression . He was having great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his boorish behavior . " Get out ! " Trying to look stern , she gestured to the door . " Not quite yet . " " You ca n't stay in here . Are you deaf ? " " You 're very pretty . " To the best of her recollection , no one had ever told her she was pretty before , so she was flabbergasted . It rocked her view of the world where she 'd always considered herself middling and-at times-inferior in every way . He continued to scrutinize her , as if devouring every inch , his blue , blue eyes not missing a single detail . " Yes , very pretty , " he repeated , " but older than I anticipated . " " Older ! " she grumbled , hating to be denigrated because of her advanced age . " You are the most rude person I 've ever met . " As if she had n't spoken , he added , " Of course , your maturity might be an advantage . And I can see that you 'll enjoy marital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist on a lot of it . " " Romping ? " " We 're going to lump along just fine . I 'm glad Lavinia persuaded me to visit . " He reached out with his finger , and he laid it on her chin , then traced it down her neck and bosom , till he arrived at the lace on the edge of her chemise . For a crazed instant , she thought he would slip under the fabric to fondle her breast , but he did n't . He dropped his hand and stepped away . Swiftly , his demeanor changed , the seductive lover vanishing . Feet clicking together , he bowed and said , " Miss Gray , I presume ? " " Yes . " " Jordan Prescott , Viscount Romsey , at your service . " " Viscount ... Romsey ? " " Yes . " He leaned nearer and whispered , " But when we 're in the throes of passion , you may call me Jordan . " She shoved him away , rattled by how his warm breath tickled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's true , but you 're no shrinking violet , yourself . " He strolled out , stopping for a last glance at her . He narrowed his focus , evaluating her as if he did n't understand what he was witnessing . " I 'm so amazed , " he muttered . " By what ? " " By Lavinia 's opinion that we 'd suit . She 's right . For once . " He left , the door shutting behind him , and she collapsed onto a chair . What had just occurred ? What did it mean ? What did he want ? He 'd confirmed-as Penelope had contended-that he 'd come to explore a marriage , but it could n't be . Lavinia never proceeded without having plotted her own gain . If Margaret were to wed the Viscount , what profit could there be to Lavinia ? Margaret paced , trying to make sense of the situation . Her body was in a state of feminine agitation , her mind awhirl and careening between hope and dread . Jordan Prescott was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be granted , and she had to learn what was really transpiring . Desperate for answers , she tugged on her clothes , pinned up her hair , and went to find her aunt . (
