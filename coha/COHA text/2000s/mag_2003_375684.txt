As a political decision , the policy President Bush announced on stem-cell research just two years ago was impressively deft . Antiabortion activists had insisted that experiments on cells derived from aborted or abandoned embryos were an outrage ; many researchers  --  and several Republican Senators  --  countered that because the cells have the potential to turn into virtually any cell type , from kidney to bone to brain , they could be invaluable in curing disease . So Bush split the difference : henceforth no newly harvested embryonic stem cells could be studied with federal funds . But the 70 or so stem-cell lines already in researchers ' hands were fair game . " This , " he said in a televised address , " allows us to explore the promise and potential of stem-cell research without crossing a fundamental moral line . " <P> Two years later , however , many scientists are pretty cynical about that statement . For one thing , the number of usable stem-cell lines turned out to be 12 , not 70 . That 's because the President 's list included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others that are tied up by private companies  --  a fact the White House readily acknowledges . All 12 , moreover , were cultured using mouse cells as a growth medium , raising the fear that they might carry mouse DNA or mouse viruses . <P> Even if all 12 are deemed safe , says Dr. Robert Lanza , medical director for Advanced Cell Technology Inc. , a biotech firm in Worcester , Mass. , that 's too small a gene pool to give scientists the genetic diversity they need . " It 's totally inadequate . American scientists are fighting with one hand tied behind their backs , " he argues . <P> " Totally " might be a bit strong . It could have been worse , says John Gearhart , a pioneer in stem-cell research at Johns Hopkins Medical School . " The President could have cut off funding altogether . " Besides , private companies like Advanced Cell that do n't need federal funding are unaffected by the ban . " The problem , " says Lanza , " is that companies have to attract investments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stem-cell research . " <P> That 's not the case overseas . The governments of Britain , Singapore , China , Australia , Japan , South Korea and Israel all provide stem-cell funding . Actor Christopher Reeve traveled to Israel last week to endorse that country 's support of research that might someday regenerate cells in his damaged spinal cord . <P> If foreign countries are investing in stem-cell science , the research will ultimately get done . But , says Gearhart , " the U.S. is the 800-pound gorilla when it comes to resources for science . If we continue to limit funding , things will proceed much more slowly . " Also , foreign governments and companies can patent their stem-cell lines and charge plenty for licensing them . <P> For many scientists outside government , in short , the glass seems half empty at best . For scientists like Dr. Elias Zerhoun , director of the National Institutes of Health , it 's evidently half full . " Remember , " he says , " that before the President made his decision , there was zero federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifesaving technology like this one , half full may not be enough .  --  With reporting by John F.
