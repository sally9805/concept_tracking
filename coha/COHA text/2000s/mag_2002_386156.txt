Simplicity , luxury , and refinement-that 's how to set a table with Italian elegance . // Italy is famous for both its food and for the style and elegance of its table dressing . Our table settings are unrivaled in simplicity and luxury . We say simplicity and luxury , but there is also a focus on craftsmanship and respect for family traditions , combined with a measure of pride , which justifies that bit of creative folly that sets us apart . For dinner in a country house or on a terrace by the sea , the table setting will be more colorful and rustic than it is on other occasions . But here , too , nothing is left to chance . With a brocaded linen tablecloth or damask linen in a vivid color by Frette , one of the largest linen producers in Italy , the dishes , the pitchers , and the soup plates should be from Ceramica di Caltagirone . This ceramic ware , from a small town in Sicily , features lively designs and colors , with decorations that often date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed down from father to son for centuries . A service whose plates have so much personality may be accompanied by flatware of simple lines to make the whole a bit lighter , such as the Caccia model in silver designed by Luigi Caccia Dominomi for Alessi , a true classic in international design . The house of Alessi is well-known for its colorful , amusing , and at times irreverent products . It manufactures and redesigns traditional and important pieces such as the Bauhaus and Dressler models , modern-looking even though they were created more than a century ago . For the rustic table , the glasses and pitchers may be of colored glass with differing tonalities , as in the Carnevale series by Venini . This famous glassmaker is one of the cult houses of " Made in Italy , " having allied its name since its 1921 founding in Murano with some of the most prestigious , world-famous names in architecture-Mendini , Sottsass , and Aulenti . If the occasion is an important one , like Christmas , a birthday , or a christening , it is time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the magnificent tapered Venini goblets in crystal and gold from the Casanova series created specifically for Fellini 's Casanova , and no longer in production . Their value is exploited to the fullest if they are placed on a delicate white organza or needlepoint lace tablecloth by Jesurum . Logically , the dishes should also be of the same quality . You can choose a classic , such as the Lago Blue model by Richard Ginori in white bone china with an electric blue border trimmed in fine gold . Thanks to an ancient underglazing procedure that Richard Ginori has been using since 1735 , this material is especially glossy and so resistant that it can be put in the dishwasher . If a touch of frivolity is needed with dessert and coffee , the plates , cups , cake plate , and sugar bowl from the Dolci Deco series are a beautiful choice . Inspired by the watercolors of the artist Davide Pizzigoni , they are designed by Bulgari and made of porcelain with delicate pastel effects . Seguso stands out among goblets in the Murano tradition . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going back to the Middle Ages . The classic models are based on eighteenth-century ones and are made in slightly iridescent opaline glass with flecks of gold between the rim and the stem . - LAVINIA DAREM The table all in sterling silver conveys simplicity and value , two concepts that are rarely tried together , because one nearly always overwhelms the other . If a bit of pride and originality are added to the table all in sterling silver ... voila , an irresistible fusion . At this table by Fratelli Cacchione , silversmiths in Milan since 1920 , no element overwhelms the other ; the combination is perfect . Extreme simplicity brings out the purity of the octagonal lines of the grand table sterling silver , brought up to date from the eighteenth-century style of King George I. Value derives from the quality of the material , which is 925/1000 sterling silver , entirely hand forged and accurately worked in all its details . The flatware was created by another great master silversmith , Calegaro of Padua . Products from Fratelli Cacchione and Calegaro are available in the LLS. at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creations are on sale at the following stores : Shreve , Crump &; Low , Boston , MA , David Orgell , Beverly Hills , CA , Betteridge Jewelers , Greenwich , CT , Elisabeth Bruns , Charlotte , NC , Coleman E.
