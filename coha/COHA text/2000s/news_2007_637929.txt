<p> On one side of a pair of wire fences , a mother moose is grunting , pushing , and stomping on the small patch of grass where she 's paced all night . On the other side , biologists Rick Sinnott and Jessy Coltrane dangle a hook and strap , as clouds of mosquitoes swarm their heads . Wedged in between is a wobbly moose calf . <p> While residents of the adjacent midtown condominiums look on , Mr. Sinnott and Ms. Coltrane pry open a space and free the calf , then watch its mother dash around the barrier to reunite with it . The animals walk to a neighboring driveway and munch on foliage , nuzzling and keeping close . As moose rescues go , this was a smooth one , says Sinnott , who calls Anchorage " a moose maze with fences . " <p> " She was the most remarkably calm cow I 've ever seen , " he says . " Usually they 'd be thumping on our heads . " <p> It 's just another morning in the life of Sinnott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have one of the more unusual jobs in America . He 's part moose therapist , part bear chaperone , part goose sergeant , part ambulance driver for hawks , and - with several poetry awards to his name - he 's part James Herriot with a hook and net . In the midst of his moose-calf rescue , an Anchorage woman calls to thank him for shooting a bear . After 36 years of refereeing conflicts between man and beast here in Alaska 's largest city , Sinnott may be America 's dean of urban wildlife . <p> " Anytime there 's an animal issue , I expect Rick to be there , " says Mayor Mark Begich . Indeed , in a local night club 's skit about wild urban animals , a parody of " Ghostbusters " went , " Who you gon na call ? Rick Sinnott ! " <p> Lean , wiry , and quick with a quip - his office door plastered with wildlife cartoons - Sinnott is a local celebrity . The decades seem to have aged him little , except for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouch of stories to rival any bear 's salmon cache . <p> *** <p> In Anchorage , a city of nearly 300,000 surrounded by mountains , forests , and the sea , and which for decades was represented by a dancing moose belting out " Wild About Anchorage , " plenty of animals exist to keep him company . <p> Anchorage is believed to host about 250 to 300 black bears and , in normal years , 55 to 65 brown ones . It is the only large city , Sinnott says , roamed by grizzlies . The city is typically home to between 200 and 300 moose in summer and possibly 1,000 in winter , when they troop down from the mountains for better living conditions , he says . <p> Foxes , wolves , and coyotes lope the greenbelts . Porcupines waddle in the woods . Bald eagles perch on branches in subdivisions ; goshawks attack skiers and runners ; and armies of migrating geese invade lawns and parks . In fall and early winter , when light is low , vehicle-moose collisions are common . <p> But summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch of wary mothers , bears come out of hibernation , and humans join them , is Sinnott 's peak season . He 's a near-daily fixture on newscasts and in local papers , discussing clashes or rescues and preaching the biologists ' gospel of keeping bears and garbage separate . His cellphone might ring 10 times a night . " My wife 's a saint , " he says . His ring tone ? The call of the whippoorwill , a reminder of his Midwestern roots . <p> A series of recent calls to Sinnott resulted in : <p> * A fruitless search , in pouring rain , for a black bear with an injured foot seen limping around a campground on the fringes of town . <p> * A long search in Kincaid Park for a black bear stalking joggers and bicyclists . Sinnott and Coltrane spent much of an afternoon toting guns along the sun-baked trails before emerging sweaty and frustrated . " This is the story of our lives . Ninety-nine percent of the time , there 's nothing left when we get there , " Sinnott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bear approached his truck ; the biologist shot it . <p> * An offering of bratwurst in a trap downtown after old dog food failed to entice a young brown bear . The bear never stopped for sausage , but wandered into a neighborhood where a police officer shot it . Sinnott and Coltrane , the young biologist likely to assume Sinnott 's mantle after he retires , had hoped to relocate the bear , which they considered a good candidate for survival in the wild - it had merely followed the creek into town . An autopsy revealed that it had not yet gotten into mischief , and had been sticking to fish and grass , avoiding " garbage bear " status . <p> * The rescue of an injured red-tailed hawk at the same time Sinnott was removing the unused bear trap . While he and Coltrane rescued the trapped moose calf at the condo complex , the hawk rested in the bed of Sinnott 's truck , awaiting transport to a bird-rehabilitation center . <p> Each year , Sinnott has to kill animals that have grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , or birdseed in yards - a risk that inspires Sinnott 's passion about garbage management . That ardor irks some long-time Alaskans who hate being told what to do with their trash . And it has sparked some well-publicized clashes with government officials . <p> In 2005 , after Sinnott used particularly salty terms to tell an Anchorage Daily News reporter that he 'd like to kick the posterior of the person who left a pile of rotting fish in the city 's wooded Hillside neighborhood , he was reprimanded by the commissioner of Fish and Game , briefly taken off bear duty , and slapped with a temporary media gag order . <p> Like-minded citizens rose to his defense . " If the state ever goes bankrupt , the last employee to be let go should be Rick Sinnott , " wrote Anchorage attorney Jeff Lowenfels in a letter to the editor . That clash came during years of fractiousness , with Sinnott arguing that the city 's attitude about trash was too lax , while the city maintained that wildlife management could n't be its sole priority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mayor and the biologist have come to an understanding : In the parts of town most likely to get four-legged tourists , a long-ignored ordinance barring residents from leaving trash out overnight has been dusted off , and garbage collection has been rescheduled to accommodate late risers . There are also plans to increase recycling and so reduce garbage piled in plastic bags ( an easy mark for the ravens and eagles ) or in bins that bears pry open . <p> *** <p> Sinnott , for his part , has made peace with the idea that police are too busy with human miscreants to spend much time corralling wildlife . He should know . Despite moose kicks and bear charges , Sinnott 's most serious injury occurred last fall , not from an animal , but when he was the victim of a drive-by shooting on his birthday . On an Anchorage thoroughfare , he found himself caught between vehicles of apparent rival gang members , and three shots pierced his car , one hitting him in the leg . Such malefaction puts the animals ' forays in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a model of human-wildlife coexistence . Elsewhere , he says , efforts tend toward separation of habitats - to everyone 's detriment : " The world ca n't work that way ... You 've got to preserve the biological diversity . " <p> Sinnott also preserves his literary side . He is a frequent winner of haiku contests held by the weekly alternative newspaper , the Anchorage Press . This year , one of his winning entries was a poem for bookish moose as well as humans : <p> Spring calving : time to <p> Be a good mother and watch <p> Your kids closely <p> ( c ) Copyright 2007 .
