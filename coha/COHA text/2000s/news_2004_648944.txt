<p> Twenty-eight N.B.A. teams were supposed to lay prostrate before the Los Angeles Lakers , tipping their hats to Karl Malone and Gary Payton for surrendering millions of dollars for a chance at a title , and to Coach Phil Jackson for winning a record 10th championship . <p> But almost from the beginning , circumstances , many of them created by the Lakers themselves , have conspired to foil the closest thing modern-day basketball has come to a regular-season Dream Team . <p> Now , roughly a month before they were supposed to seize the championship , the Lakers are facing a 2-0 deficit in their four-of-seven-game Western Conference semifinal series with the San Antonio Spurs . The series and the title are still within reach , but the Lakers , who are host to the Spurs on Sunday in Game 3 at Staples Center , are almost dead . The question is , why ? <p> A factor that can not be ignored or quantified is the impact of Kobe Bryant 's sexual-assault case . Payton and Malone signed with the Lakers at Shaquille O'Neal 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so the Lakers ' euphoria over their Fab Four lasted barely 24 hours as Bryant contemplated sitting out the season . Instead of being rejuvenated , the Lakers were deflated , their mood changing from triumphant to defensive before the season even began . <p> " This has been a real big challenge simply because we 've gone through something we 've never experienced before , " Jackson said late in the season , " and that 's a player that 's had to be on guard with a pretrial hearing many , many times during the course of the season that 's disrupted this year . " <p> In addition to missing the bulk of training camp , which stalled the Lakers ' opportunity to develop all-important chemistry , Bryant has missed several practices and has arrived late to games because of his legal obligations in Eagle , Colo. , where the hearings are taking place . In fact , Bryant will fly to Colorado after Sunday 's game for a three-day hearing that begins Monday . <p> One might have expected Bryant to avoid controversy , but on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out of shape " and questioned his character and his professionalism . The episode began a season-long dialogue , spawning numerous news media reports about Bryant 's strained relationship with not only O'Neal , but also with the rest of the team . <p> Jackson admitted that the reports were not all fiction , saying that the pressure of Bryant 's legal situation had hurt his interaction with teammates . <p> " I think the aspect in which it 's affected Kobe is in his ability to relate to his teammates as well , or as comfortably perhaps , in all the areas that he 's been able to relate to them in previous years , " Jackson said Friday after the Lakers practiced in El Segundo , Calif . <p> Bryant has never had strong relationships with his teammates . Somewhat of a loner , he has offended them by not taking part in the usual expressions of team camaraderie : dinner out with the guys , team parties , the locker room frolics after practice . Although his indifference toward his teammates frustrates them , few truly dislike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bryant appears impervious to the chatter that surrounds him . <p> " I think it 's really silly when people bring it up , " he said of his relationship with his teammates . " People want to talk about it . People want to pry for information . It 's gossip . Some of it may be factual , some of it may not be . I do n't really care . All I care about is Game 3 . " <p> What bothers the Lakers far more than Bryant 's personality  --  and what has greater repercussions on the court  --  is the way he plays . Bryant 's penchant for deviating from the triangle offense , going one-on-five and trying to usurp O'Neal 's role as the primary option on offense , makes the Lakers feel as if they are playing with a loose cannon . <p> When asked if reports of the players ' hostility toward Bryant were accurate , O'Neal said no , but he implied that someone was not conforming to the system . <p> " I do n't hate anybody , " O'Neal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being on the team , I know how stuff 's supposed to go , and if stuff does n't go like that , then , ' Houston , we have a problem . ' " <p> The ability of O'Neal and Bryant to play through their conflicts is well documented ; they feuded through three championship seasons . But adding two more superstars , one who is as stubborn and as resistant to the triangle as Bryant , is perhaps too much discord to overcome . <p> " There 's a reason why you only have an All-Star Weekend for three days and one game , " said Rick Fox , a seventh-year Laker , who started on the championship teams of 2000 , 2001 and 2002 . " There 's a reason why most great players are spread out around the league : because they all bring a certain level of dominance , and sometimes too many cooks in the kitchen confuses all the chefs . " <p> Malone has been accepting of his role as the third option , though Bryant 's frequent failure to pass to him when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand , has been reluctant to adapt . <p> Accustomed to dominating the ball through his first 13 seasons in the league , Payton has fought the triangle from Day 1 . Early in the season , he pushed the ball in transition to avoid setting up the offense . But fast-break opportunities are less frequent in the playoffs , and his lack of familiarity with the offense is showing . <p> He has also complained about playing fewer minutes , even after victories . <p> " Gary has struggled with a new offensive concept after 12 or 13 years of playing a certain way , " Mitch Kupchak , the Lakers ' general manager , said . <p> Besides the disharmony , the Lakers have had injury woes . O'Neal , Bryant and Malone missed a combined 72 regular-season games , limiting the chances for the team to develop chemistry and leaving it quite disorganized . <p> One game , the Lakers ignore O'Neal . The next , they force-feed him the ball in the post . One game , Bryant is content to pass and play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rim every time he touches the ball . <p> Malone and mainly Payton appear lost , struggling to find their way in an offense they barely understand and in roles ( third and fourth options ) they have never had to accept in their basketball careers . The spacing in Jackson 's offense is so poor , Fox joked last month , that it looks more like a trapezoid than a triangle . <p> Because Malone , 40 , and Payton , 35 , each averaged 20 points last season , their age was overlooked when they joined the Lakers . <p> But their effectiveness has diminished quickly since last summer , Malone degenerating into strictly a jump shooter , and Payton , once the best perimeter defender in the league , unable to stay in front of opposing point guards . It 's no accident that the Lakers ' defense , stellar in their championship seasons , was in the lower half of the league this season . <p> The Lakers ' decline began even before Malone and Payton entered the picture . Few remember that they were uncoachable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Jordan 's seal of approval and inheriting a team that was desperate for success , Jackson had the Lakers ' full attention . <p> But that began to change last season . Team disharmony forced Jackson to eliminate many of the Zen techniques he had used during his nine championship seasons with the Chicago Bulls and the Lakers . Team meditation was thrown out the window . <p> " Last year , the team really kind of pushed the spiritual aspect away or could n't embrace it because there was some divisiveness that kept us apart , " Jackson said late in the season . " Meditation is very difficult . You have to really be in harmony to sit with one another without being uncomfortable , and it became difficult . " <p> Bryant in particular has seemed to tune out Jackson , leaving Jackson and his teammates to guess how aggressively or how passively he is going to play from game to game . <p> " For some reason , after three years of success , as a group we stopped buying into what got us there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on why we won three championships , which is sad . That 's just the poison of success , the inability to have it and not let it consume you and turn you into egomaniacs . " <p> Perhaps two consecutive second-round exits will humble the Lakers and set them on the road to recovery . With time running out on their championship aspirations , it 's too bad Malone and Payton will probably go down as casualties . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
