On a typical Saturday night , thousands of American teenagers flood Tijuana 's Revolucion Avenue in search of the kind of fun they ca n't find at home . The legal drinking age here is 18 , not that anyone bothers to check . There are hookers . And drugs . And there 's a rumor that if you know the right people , a particularly exotic combination of both can be arranged without too much of a hassle . When the sun goes down , the crowds thicken outside the 80-odd cantinas along the avenue , and pulsing jock-rock mingles with the aroma of stale beer and fresh vomit to form Revolucion 's unmistakable atmosphere . " This is what the world knows of Tijuana , " says Pepe Mogt , 31 , smiling at the drunken humanity sprawled out before him . " It gives us a lot of material . " <P> What Mogt makes of it is called nortec , a new breed of music that mixes traditional Mexican norteno and tambora riffs on the accordion , tuba and drums with electronica .

But in the same way that rock ' n ' roll is more than just the sum of a few chords , nortec has expanded well beyond some creative samples and a break beat . Graphic artists , fashion designers and filmmakers have been inspired to shrug off Tijuana 's reputation as a cultural void and address the contrary realities of a place that 's neither First World nor Third World ; a culture that is neither Mexican nor American ; an economy propelled by the dual engines of drug traffic and high-tech maquiladoras ; a large , stable middle class sandwiched between grotesque poverty and excessive narco wealth . The goal , simply , is to transform the strangeness of Tijuana into art . <P> Like Tijuana , Pepe Mogt 's musical taste is an accident of geography .

By 1986 , he had scraped together enough money digging ditches and working in restaurants to buy a Yamaha Portasound and began making music with an adolescent synth band called Artefakto . <P> But nobody was listening . What little tolerance existed in Tijuana for electronic music was obliterated by the arrival in the early ' 90s of rock en Espanol , an irony-free form of hard rock . Artefakto broke up , but Mogt and his friend Melo Ruiz , 32 , kept experimenting with techno and electronica under the name Fussible ( foo-SEE-blay ) and sending out tapes to record companies . " Our music was too strange for the Mexican labels , " Mogt recalls . " They kept telling us to make it more pop or put vocals on . The European labels thought it was too old and unoriginal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300 guys doing break beats . The problem was we were trying to sound just like them . "
