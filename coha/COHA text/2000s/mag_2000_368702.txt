In the central Florida corridor that could determine the next bell captain of the Lincoln Bedroom , Greg and Virginia Harrell feel the same way as a lot of their neighbors . Vice President Al Gore or Texas Governor George Bush ? They were more excited about their options at the Bill O ' Fare Food Court in the Brandon Town Center Mall on a recent family outing . <P> " After watching the first two debates , I was just more confused , " said Greg , 40 , an insurance agent who is a registered Democrat but a fairly conservative guy , especially since daughters Emily , 3 , and Leah , seven months , came along . " I was leaning Bush in the beginning , but I 've been back and forth ever since . " <P> " He 's been back and forth every day , " said Virginia , 37 , an education consultant and former teacher who grew up in New Jersey and relocated here after college . Not that she knew which campaign poster to plant in the front lawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's public schools , and she kind of liked Gore at first . But it was a brief affair with a cold fish . " I watched very closely , " she said of the final debate . " I wanted either Bush or Gore to give me a reason to like him . " It did n't happen . <P> The Harrells ' problem is one that was voiced over and over in three days of interviews in a fast-growing , politically moderate area the Bush and Gore camps consider up for grabs and critical to their success . With a handful of exceptions , even voters who have decided on a candidate said they were n't thrilled with their choice . " Bush is the lesser of two evils , " said Joe Spencer , 45 , an electrical technician . Betty Ford , retired from the construction business at 52 , felt the same way about Gore . " I just find him so  --  What 's the word ?  --  unbelievable . But it 'll probably be Gore . The economy is good . " <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan MacManus , who teaches political science at the University of South Florida . She 's only half right . They have politics fatigue . The campaign seems like an insufferably long extension of the Clinton scandal and the partisan bickering that followed . And now , after a year of campaigning that felt like 10 , Floridians are daily subjected to an assault of vapid , 30-second TV spots that seem designed to lower the national IQ . <P> " I 'm not a masochist , " said Don Fletcher , 57 , a telecommunications consultant who was asked over coffee at the mall if he was tuned in to the campaign . Kind of tough to get caught up in it , others said , when one candidate has the burden of proving he 's not a goober in a nice suit and the other is forever trying on personalities the way some people try on shoes . <P> " The process turns you off , and it 's got to where I do n't even know who 's lying and who 's telling the truth anymore , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago from Atlantic City , N.J. <P> If you believe his mother , Bush is the one you can trust . She said so in a message she left on Ford 's answering machine ( and on thousands of others in Florida ) in which she extolled her son 's virtues . It was a smart move , given Barbara Bush 's likability , unless you happen to think it underscores George W. 's lack of political maturity . It 's like the guy needs a permission slip from Mom saying it 's O.K. for Dubya to go on the field trip to the White House .
