The Power of Two By Patti O'Shea Dorchester Publishing Patti O'Shea Hell 's reputation had n't been exaggerated . The authorities could make quite a dent in their one hundred most wanted fugitives list if they came here with identity scanners . How the heck had this bar become a favorite hangout for Special Forces commandos ? It hardly seemed as if they 'd be welcomed , yet the two groups peacefully coexisted . Since the soldiers were the only clean-cut men in the bar , it was easy to identify them although none were in uniform . From a distance , they looked like choirboys who 'd inadvertently wandered into the wrong place . Cai knew better . She 'd trained with these men . They were hard , formidable , and dangerous in their own right . Maybe the truce was n't so much peaceful as wary . For both parties . A bellow of rage jerked her attention back to the guys arguing over the horse race and she saw them square off against each other . Conversation ceased as everyone turned to watch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converged on the combatants and a couple of zaps put both fighters down for the count , their bodies convulsing strongly . Then the men were picked up and carted away . The customers returned to their own pursuits as soon as the show was over , but talk seemed more animated than it had been earlier . When she intercepted a few calculatingglances , she knew she 'd delayed long enough . It was time to do what she 'd come here for and get out before she attracted more unwelcome attention . How hard could it be anyway ? Inhaling deeply to calm her nerves was a mistake . The stench of stale beer , body odor , urine and vomit nearly made her choke . Really , there was no reason to worry ; she knew Jake better than anyone . Okay , so she never would have guessed he 'd come to a bar like this , but it had been an unusually rough day . Maybe he was n't in Hell . Maybe she 'd gotten the information wrong . Yeah , their probes were synced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe she 'd mixed things up somehow . It was a miracle that her data implant had resumed functioning at all , the accuracy could be impaired . Cai bit her lip . Ignoring the tension building between her shoulders , she perused the crowd . She was n't wrong . Now that she was looking , she found Jake easily . He sat at a round table in the corner with two other soldiers . Her hands clenched at her sides as she studied his profile . Though deep shadows concealed his face , she could see he was watchful , his eyes never still . She took a step forward . Stopped . Squared her shoulders and walked toward him . She could do this . Though he did n't react as she came up beside him , Jake was aware of her presence . He had to be . Even if he had n't sensed her approach , which she doubted , his friends were staring at her . Cai stared right back until Jake turned . His expression said get lost , but it quickly became neutral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why she 'd come over , but she took a moment to study him anyway . The first thing she noticed was that he was coiled , ready to spring if she posed a danger . And he was even better looking in person . His glacier blue eyes were striking with his dark hair and tanned face , but it was n't the color that prompted her to gaze deeply into them . She was trying to find the man she knew . The man who was always tender and thoughtful with her , the man she talked with and comforted in the aftermath of his nightmares . Cai 's stomach twisted when she could n't find anything familiar in this stranger 's hard face . Part of her wanted to excuse herself , but she could n't . She needed to talk with him tonight . There were no other options . " Hello , Jake . " He lifted an eyebrow . " No one calls me Jake . " He sounded different to her ears . Harsher than she 'd thought he would . A shiver began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became noticeable . " I do . I always have . " She held her breath as he pushed slowly to his feet . In her peripheral vision , she saw him slide the chair out of the way with his foot . This had been the wrong approach , she decided , exhaling with a silent sigh . Perhaps she 'd have been wiser to wait till he 'd left Hell to talk to him . If she 'd thought it through longer and not let her impatience get in the way , she would have realized he 'd be on his guard here . " Always ? " he asked menacingly . " I do n't know who you are . " When the other men stood , flanking Jake on either side , she realized they 'd heard the warning in his tone as well . Great , just what she needed . The three musketeers . As she met their hard stares , Cai tried to decide the best tack to take . Before she picked an option , the hair on her nape prickled . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went around her neck . Training took over . She squatted and leaned forward , sliding her hand between her throat and the arm as she stepped sideways . Almost in the same motion , she brought her elbow back into his mid-section , using the full force of her body to add all the power she could . She heard an " oomph , " but did n't hesitate . Turning , she hooked her foot behind his leg and pushed the man . Since he was already off-balance , he went down like a polar bear on wet ice . Cai was about to take him out of the equation indefinitely when she was wrapped in a hug . Though she had no clue how she knew , she was sure it was Jake . When the man she 'd put on the floor began to stand , she tried to get free . " Down , killer , " her recep said , mouth near her ear and she thought he might be laughing . That was when she realized her attacker had n't been one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big , huge , enormous commando . When he was upright , she saw he was at least six and a half feet tall with muscles that strained the seams of his T-shirt . Holy crap . All that practice really had paid off . She could react , and succeed , outside of a controlled situation . " Did n't your momma ever tell you not to grab a woman without an invitation ? " she snarled . She heard the snickers from the men behind her a split second before Jake let go and stepped away . " I wo n't make that mistake again , " the man grumbled , sidling past her to join the other three . She moved with him , keeping him in front of her . He would n't be easy to take down a second time . It surprised her that he kept her in his line of sight too . As if someone his size would be leery of a woman who was five foot eight , and half his weight . Yeah , right . When he stood with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were laughing now and she bit her lip as her nerves returned . She 'd been damn lucky that the bouncers had n't swooped in and zapped her . Since she needed to keep her mind on the situation , she put that thought aside . " Who the hell are you ? " Jake demanded . Well , as her great-grandma Nguyen used to say , in for a penny , in for a pound . " I 'm Cai . " " Nice try , " he drawled sarcastically . " I do n't know where you heard the name , but you made a mistake . Cai is n't human . " " Not before I 've had my first cup of coffee , no , but after that , I 'm as human as anyone else . " " She 's not bad , Tuck , " the commando she put on the floor said . " Quick witted enough to keep up with you . Maybe you should play nice for a while . You could use some fun . " Cai looked past Jake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he meant by fun . " Let me guess , you 're Gnat , right ? " That wiped the mirth off his face . Unfortunately , it also brought her closer scrutiny than before . She should have kept her mouth shut . Now the cross-examination would begin . Unless .... Hmm . Her idea would either preempt the questioning or they would want to haul her into headquarters . " Yes , I know who you are and that you were nicknamed after an insect because you 're such a pest . They picked Gnat because of your size . " The man really was a damn mountain . She shifted her focus over one . " You 're always reading something , the more obscure the better , so they call you the Professor . Not too original , but it could be worse . " Cai switched to the man on Jake 's other side and bit the inside of her lip when she could n't identify him . Then she realized why . " You 're not on the same team with these guys . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not recently anyway . " " You sure you do n't know her , Tuck ? " the man she did n't recognize asked quietly . " Do you think I 'd forget ? " Jake did n't take his attention from her . " How do you know this stuff ? " Cai shrugged . " You told me . " " No , I did n't . " She fought the need to back up a step at his tone . This was n't going well . There was only one way to salvage this mess . Cai sighed . She 'd hoped he 'd believe her without it , but clearly that was n't going to happen . Mentally , she reached for the neural implant and opened the pathway that connected them . Jake , I could n't know these things if you had n't told me . For a split second , he stared at her , then it sank in . She saw it happen . " Son of a bitch , " he muttered . He took her by the elbow and hauled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Cai heard Gnat say with a short laugh before Jake had her out of earshot . ( Continues ... ) by Patti O'Shea
