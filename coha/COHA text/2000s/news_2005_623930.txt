<p> There are parallels between the way Mike Nolan 's regime is beginning with the 49ers and the way the Bill Walsh era began 26 years ago . <p> Walsh was able to make a change for the better . It remains to be seen if Nolan gets a real chance to improve things . <p> The biggest difference between the situations the two coaches faced is the ownership , and its approach . Walsh was allowed to move quickly and boldly to bring life into the organization . Nolan has spent his first year working under a threadbare management structure that has no chance of success . <p> For Nolan and the 49ers , the biggest issue of the coming offseason is not whether they draft Reggie Bush ( which , if they have the chance , they should ) . The biggest issue is whether some football management talent will be brought into the organization to support Nolan and personnel boss Scot McCloughan . <p> Ownership should demand it without Nolan even asking . But the word is John York resists the idea of strengthening the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he still envisions a significant role for his son . <p> When Walsh was hired before the 1979 season , the help came with him . Even during his 2-14 run in ' 79 , it was clear that progress was being made . This year , there is nothing to indicate progress . <p> Both Walsh and Nolan took over teams that were 2-14 the year before they arrived . <p> Both of them took over franchises with owners who had made serious missteps in their first couple of years , franchises that seemed to have no hope and were being run by general managers who , for different reasons , took down the organization . <p> Joe Thomas , who preceded Walsh , was a megalomaniac . As the 49ers ' general manager , Thomas made it his personal mission to destroy the team 's history , throwing away old game films and removing pictures of former players from the walls . Thomas would allow no one to question him . <p> Terry Donahue , who preceded Nolan , was different from Thomas . As general manager , Donahue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as Thomas ' because he also was lazy , in over his head , and more interested in covering his rear end and undermining his coach than working with the coach . <p> Walsh was 2-14 his first season . Nolan is 2-12 and perhaps on the way to 2-14 , also . Progress was more visible during Walsh 's first year than during Nolan 's first year , because Walsh so quickly improved the offense that , even with Steve DeBerg at quarterback , the 49ers were fun to watch . <p> This year 's offense has been unwatchable , for the most part . But a two-win season is still a two-win season , and , at any rate , the point of the exercise is not to try to compare Nolan with Walsh , which would be silly , but something more basic : <p> Which of the two coaches walked into a more palatable situation in San Francisco , and , though it would be folly to expect Nolan to match Walsh 's considerable Hall of Fame accomplishments , what must he do to at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Walsh had Eddie DeBartolo as his owner . Walsh was the fourth coach hired by DeBartolo in less than two years , so Walsh knew he was n't going to work for the most patient man in America . Nolan has John York as his owner . Nolan was York 's second coaching hire in five years . <p> It was a pain to work for DeBartolo . Walsh was almost fired several times , at least once to the point where he did n't know whether he was supposed to come to work the next day . But DeBartolo also gave Walsh anything he needed , whether it was money , people or support , and that made it possible for Walsh to do his job with , as we know now , spectacular results . <p> That was all Eddie wanted : results . <p> Of course , it also is a pain to work for York , but in a different way . According to many who have worked for him , he 's a meddler . Rather than offer support , he often offers interference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is much more suspicious of those around him than DeBartolo and much more resistant to suggestions of change . <p> It has been suggested that , because of friction between York and DeBartolo , his brother-in-law , that York was intent on proving he could do a better job of owning the team than DeBartolo did , as idiotic as that premise seems to the rest of us . <p> Edge : Walsh . He took over a much better situation than Nolan inherited . <p> Walsh also surrounded himself with a better support system than Nolan has , and that part was interesting . Walsh has a reputation as a big-ego guy , but he made sure he hired smart , experienced football people , and he wanted to hear what they had to say . He did n't always like it , such as the time his staff talked him out of trading Joe Montana to San Diego , but he was willing to listen and take advice , and there were plenty of sage hands in the offices down the hall from him . <p> With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony Razzano and Allan Webb , the 49ers had an excellent management structure in place . McVay and Ralston were former NFL head coaches . McVay would become an NFL executive of the year . They knew the league , they knew how it worked , and they knew the people . <p> Walsh also was fortunate that former coach Monte Clark had left behind a young offensive line that played a significant , if somewhat underappreciated , role in building the team 's dynasty . <p> The general manager of another NFL team said recently that bringing in McVay and Ralston were Walsh 's best early moves . <p> " He brought in two old , savvy guys who had been around , " the GM said . " That has a calming effect . You 've seen it all and , when things go bad , you know you 've been there before and you can come out of those things . There 's not panic in older people . You have to have some of that blend around . " <p> Nolan started with a front office devoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the roster at any position . His front office consists of York , York 's son , Jed , and the two money-crunching MBAs , Paraag Marathe and Terry Tumey . Smart people around the NFL are stunned that the 49ers have done absolutely nothing to strengthen their management structure . <p> On the roster , the team 's perceived strength was at linebacker , but Julian Peterson has not made it all the way back from his Achilles injury , and the area has not been as strong as it was thought to be . The most encouraging sign on the player front is the seeming development of the offensive line , which did a decent job against a tough Jacksonville defensive line Sunday . Once Kwame Harris is exiled to the bench , the line could be set for the future . <p> Second question . How to dig out of the hole . <p> When Walsh took over the 49ers , he found his stock of draft choices depleted because of the ridiculous 5-for-1 deal that Thomas made for an over-the-hill O.J. Simpson . Further , Walsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how teams could acquire players , because there was no such thing as free agency . <p> The 49ers had to depend on the draft , on trades and on players discarded by other teams . Walsh used all those avenues , drafting Montana in his first year and Ronnie Lott in his third , trading for Fred Dean , finding Dwight Hicks in a health-food store and getting Hacksaw Reynolds after he was dumped by the Rams . <p> Nolan arrived with a full stockpile of draft picks , including the first overall selection , which he used on quarterback Alex Smith . It is still far too early , of course , to say how that one will turn out , but as some of the other draft picks get more playing time , there would seem to be several keepers in the bunch . <p> There is a big advantage for Nolan that Walsh did not have , free agency , but it must be used wisely . Too often , teams treat free agency as a band-aid approach , something the Raiders have done without much success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value is their name . <p> Many of the best free-agent signings in the NFL this year were hardly headline-making : Derrick Burgess by the Raiders , Kyle Vanden Bosch by the Titans , Joe Jurevicius by the Seahawks . Burgess leads the league in sacks , Vanden Bosch is tied for second , and Jurevicius is tied for fourth in the league in touchdown catches . <p> In other words , there are gems to be found , but the odds are long . <p> Edge : Nolan . He arrived with a better chance at finding players . <p> Now , all he has to do is find them before next year . <p> CHART : <p> Walsh vs .
