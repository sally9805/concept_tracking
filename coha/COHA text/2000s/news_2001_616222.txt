<p> SunTrust Banks has upped the ante for Wachovia , but L. Phillip Humann , SunTrust 's chairman and chief executive , said today he does n't expect a bidding war against First Union . <p> Humann stressed a Wachovia-SunTrust marriage makes the best sense for shareholders , customers , the banks and its employees . <p> A similar message was delivered today by First Union . <p> " After reviewing SunTrust 's unsolicited proposal , we remain firmly convinced that our proposed merger is clearly superior for Wachovia 's shareholders , " chairman and CEO G. Kennedy Thomson said . <p> The extra money shareholders will get if SunTrust succeeds in buying Wachovia is overshadowed by " the tremendous integration risk that arises in the unsolicited SunTrust proposal , " Thompson said . No hostile acquisitions of large U.S. banks have proven successful , he said . <p> But Humann said that Wachovia and SunTrust have similar markets , strategies and would complement each other and give SunTrust entry into the Carolinas , where it does n't have a presence , without closing Wachovia branches there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have made L.M. " Bud " Baker , Wachovia 's chief executive officer , CEO of the combined company and would have kept the Wachovia name  --  was still a better deal than what First Union offered . <p> So why was SunTrust jilted at the last minute ? <p> " I 'm not aware of the specifics of what was discussed at the Wachovia ( Dec. 15 ) board meeting , " Humann said later . " But one could speculate that the specifics of a SunTrust transaction were not discussed in detail . <p> " We had 80 people  --  about 40 people on each side working at remote locations doing due diligence . Bud called me and said ' I 've thought this through and this is n't going to work . ' " <p> While he did n't rule out the possibility that Charlotte-based First Union , which last month announced a merger agreement with Wachovia , might come up with a counter offer , Humann all but suggested the move was impossible . <p> " I 'm not sure that they will and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our transaction is a lot better . " <p> Even so , hostile takeovers of banks have been rare in recent years . And the battle is fraught with risk . Some analysts predict that if SunTrust were to fail in its bid , it might itself be snapped up by a larger financial institution . <p> And some of metro Atlanta 's corporate titans who sit on the boards of SunTrust and Wachovia find themselves on opposite sides of the table . <p> Opinion is divided as to who will ultimately win the prize . But if the battle is protracted , analysts say the losers may well be customers and employees . <p> " It could hurt morale , " said analyst Thomas Theurkauf at Keefe , Bruyette &; Woods , a securities firm specializing in financial services stocks . " Employees do n't know what 's going to happen next . Customer service could deteriorate . " <p> Today , Humann conceded that point . <p> " I think that 's a legitimate concern , particularly with respect to Wachovia 's employees , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board considers . " <p> He urged Wachovia 's board of directors to terminate its merger agreement with First Union and to expedite talks with SunTrust . <p> That 's unlikely , for now . <p> " We have a binding legal agreement with Wachovia that we intend to vigorously pursue to consummation , " Thomson said in a statement late Monday . <p> " We plan to continue the constructive merger integration dialogue which we 've had over the past month and look forward to completing our merger with Wachovia . " <p> For its part , Wachovia said its board of directors will meet to review SunTrust Banks ' proposal " in the near future . " It said its merger with First Union " is proceeding on schedule " and that " SunTrust 's proposal requires no immediate action by Wachovia 's shareholders . " <p> SunTrust 's latest offer marks the second time it has tried to combine with Wachovia since late last year . Wachovia pulled out of a deal in December at the last minute . <p> David Stumpf of A.G. Edwards &; Sons thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer , which calls for swapping 1.081 of its shares for each Wachovia share . It offered 1.03 shares per share in December . First Union has offered two of its shares for each Wachovia share . <p> To sweeten the deal , SunTrust said it would increase its annual dividend to $2.22 a share to give Wachovia shareholders the equivalent of the $2.40 a share dividend they get now . SunTrust Banks ' annual dividend is currently $1.60 . <p> " The SunTrust offer is a financially higher offer , " Stumpf said . " I believe Wachovia 's board will be compelled to consider the SunTrust offer . " <p> Even so , some analysts predicted the fight could be a lengthy one . <p> Richard X. Bove of Raymond James &; Associates thinks the battle will last three months . And he predicts First Union will prevail . <p> " First Union is n't going to get the sweetheart deal that it had before , " Bove said . " But I think First Union is going to win the contest . It ca n't afford to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Union comes back ( with a higher offer ) , then SunTrust comes back , then First Union . " <p> Bove noted that First Union is much larger than SunTrust , in terms of assets , and has more cash . <p> And cash , he predicts , could decide who will walk away with the prize . First Union and SunTrust are unlikely to significantly increase the stock portion of their deals , he said . <p> " It would only kill the price of their own stock , " Bove explained . So he thinks any higher bids will include cash . <p> Bove calculates First Union has $50 billion to $78 billion in cash vs. $18 billion to $25 billion for SunTrust . <p> " I think Wachovia 's going to go for $75  --  $60 in stock and $15 in cash , " Bove predicted . That would value Wachovia at about $15.78 billion , based on more than 210.3 million shares outstanding . " The company that makes that offer will be the winner , and I think First Union will be the winner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mark Patterson , an analyst at NWQ Investment Management , which owns about 2.5 million First Union shares , went on record as discounting a bidding war . <p> Even if the bidding does not continue , SunTrust has increased its own profile . According to at least one analyst , that increases the risk of SunTrust itself becoming a takeover target . <p> " The visibility of SunTrust picked up substantially today , " Bove said . " SunTrust revealed how strong their earnings position is . " <p> Humann does n't think SunTrust will be a target . <p> " We looked very hard at the vulnerability issue , " he said . " We decided it 's not an issue . We do not have to do this acquisition . We do n't believe there is any vulnerability . " <p> First Union also could be a target if it fails to win Wachovia , said Stumpf of A.G. Edwards . <p> " If SunTrust is successful with its bid for Wachovia , we could see more deal-making among larger regional banks given the increased threat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " And , interestingly , First Union could emerge as one of the more vulnerable targets . " <p> So the stakes are high . <p> " We do n't know where this is going to take us , " said analyst Theurkauf of Keefe , Bruyette &; Woods . " This is a book that may contain many chapters . " <p> What 's certain is that a merger of SunTrust and Wachovia would create a Southeastern powerhouse . <p> It would have a " dominant franchise from Baltimore though Florida , " said Stumpf . <p> The combined companies would have about $180 billion in assets , $98 billion in deposits , 1,842 branches , 3,347 ATMs and more than 7.5 million retail customers . <p> It would become the nation 's eighth-largest banking firm with the most deposits in Georgia , Florida , South Carolina and Virginia . It would be No. 3 in North Carolina , No. 4 in Tennessee and No. 5 in Maryland . <p> In metro Atlanta , the combined companies would have deposits of $16.8 billion , with a No. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , D.C. , area , it also would be tops , with deposits of $11.6 billion , for a 19 percent share . A bank with a deposit relationship with a customer can sell that customer more products and services , such as loans and financial investments .
