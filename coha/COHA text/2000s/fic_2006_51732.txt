WHEN HE SAW HER THE FIRST TIME she stood in the hallway , her bookjag slung over her shoulder . She was talking to another girl , the one he would learn came from Chile , and the way she extracted her hair from the green strap it was snagged by caused her to wriggle a little . The bookbag slid down to the floor . When she saw him the first time she noticed him watching , his locker half-open , a key in his hand . The Fogg Art Museum had a library he studied in ; Lawrence picked up her notebook , then handed it back . <p> " Thanks , " said Hermia , and turned and walked down the hall . They would remember this later , years later ; he said , " You dropped it on purpose , " and she said , " Do n't flatter yourself . " It was mid-March 1962 , and he was a senior at Harvard . He had been driving his mother 's Impala , the gray convertible she 'd loaned him for use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irving Street with a parking space . On weekends he and Will would drive together to the Cape or Walden Pond or Newport , or to L.L. Bean in Maine . There had been a thaw that week , and they took the top down and turned on the heater and the radio full blast . Monday morning , returning from Truro , Lawrence had ordered a hot dog for breakfast , and Will respected this . " It 's all about freedom , " he said . <p> Hermia was black haired , tall , and already late for class . The class was on the origins and flowering and decline of the Baroque , and it made no difference that she would be late . Their art history professor stood on a raised platform in front of the screen , using a flashlight as pointer and talking about the meticulous brushwork of a woman 's necklace or a soldier 's beard . He was an expert on Peter Paul Rubens , and much of the term was devoted to that " prince among painters " ; he said nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You can practically feel it , " he marveled , trailing his beam up the nudes outstretched leg . " Just look at the articulation of this ankle and the way the knee enters the sheets . " <p> They met again that afternoon , at Elsie 's Sandwich Shop . Lawrence was waiting for his order , the one he always ordered-an Elsie 's Special , heavy on the dressing-when she came through the Mt . Auburn Street entrance and took a vacant stool . " Are n't you the one with the bookbag ? " he asked , and she gazed unblinking at him and said yes , hello . " How was your class ? " he asked her , and she told him , dull . Well , not exactly , not really dull , but on a spring day like this she just had n't wanted to be in the room , she just could n't wait to be out in the light , and he said he 'd felt that way also and had driven in that morning from the Cape . <p> Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? The dunes ? " <p> Hermia nodded . " I do . " <p> She asked herself-and later could remember wondering-whether she wanted this back-and-forth to continue or to stop . Did she need to tell him , for instance , that her family had been vacationing in Truro for what seemed like forever , and since 1955 had owned a house by Ballston Beach ? She loved it there-the weathered shingles and climbing roses by the fence , the path to the sea she could see down the hill-and it was her secret space , the place she prized most in the world . Did she need to tell him her father the painter had had a show of dunes in Provincetown every season , every weather , every time of day ; and yes , she did know Truro and had explored each hummock of the beach .... <p> " I 'm Lawrence , " he told her . <p> " Hermia . " <p> " Art history . Is that what you 're majoring in ? " <p> " No . English . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I did n't know it was English but I did think it was n't art history . " <p> " Because ? " <p> " Because that 's my major , " said Lawrence . " And I would have noticed . " <p> Her roommate Silvana arrived . Silvana came from Valparaiso but had gone to boarding school in Switzerland , and her English was formal , precise . The girls spoke about the weather and their group assignment to memorize slides : two hundred paintings by Rubens they needed to learn for the hour exam . <p> " He did n't do a lot of them , " said Lawrence . <p> " Are you kidding ? Hundreds . Thousands " <p> " Except his studio apprentices would rough in the sky and the clouds . Or the background figures , often , and the occasional horse . " <p> " Are you a painter ? " asked Silvana . <p> " No . " <p> " Her father 's a painter , " she said . <p> Hermia stood . " Well , we 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We each take forty images and tell the others what to look for . Venus and Adonis . Actaeon and the hunting dogs . The one where he gazes on Artemis-or would Rubens have called her Diana ? - and hey , presto , our great hunter turns into a stag . " <p> " What kind of painter ? " asked Lawrence . He received his roast beef sandwich and paid his fifty-five cents . <p> " A good one , " said Silvana . " You 'd have heard of him . " <p> The girls left . <p> The third time was that Thursday , and again unplanned . He saw her walk down Hilliard Street and recognized her loose-limbed gait , the way she stepped out from the side entrance to the Loeb Drama Center and strode long-legged , the swing of her hips , and how she held her head down . She was wearing a green cape and knee-high polished leather boots and a knitted cap . There was slush in the gutters and snow shoveled in piles at the edge of the pavement ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . Her eyes were a deep brown . <p> " Hey , " Lawrence said , " hello . " <p> Tires screeching , a delivery van rounded the corner to Brattle Street . They stepped back from the spray . <p> " Strange , is n't it ? " said Hermia . " Three times this week . " <p> " They 're trying to tell us something . " <p> " Who ? " <p> " The gods of Coincidence . What were you doing at the Loeb ? " <p> " The Flies , " she said . " The play by Jean-Paul Sartre ? " <p> " Rehearsing ? " <p> Hermia shook her head . " Stage managing , " she said . " Silvana-you remember her-is playing the part of Electra . I go along for the ride . " <p> " Can I buy you a coffee ? " <p> Her gaze was frank , assessing him . What else was he asking ? she wondered . What else would he offer and should she accept ? A fine snow fell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silence between them extending , expanding , and how the pause before she answered made it seem a kind of verdict : " Yes . " <p> They went to Casablanca and drank caf au lait . He told her that he planned to be an architect , an urban designer maybe , and he believed in design ; a sense of the shape of the whole , he said , is what this country needs more of-consciousness , coherence-and not the higgledy-piggledy **38;2376;TOOLONG arrangement of the marketplace . He was going , he assured her , to make trains run on time . <p> " You 're joking , right ? " <p> " Right , " Lawrence said . He lit her Pall Mall and stared at the rise of her breasts . <p> Casablanca was a coffee shop beneath the Brattle Theater ; it displayed framed posters of the movie Casablanca and wall-size photographs of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains . The space at that hour was dimly lit , empty , and the man behind the bar was setting out glasses in rows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amricain and another of the sheet music for " As Time Goes By . " <p> Upstairs they were showing LAvventura , and Lawrence asked if she had seen it and what she thought of Antonioni ; he himself had seen La Dolce Vita twice . He thought the final sequence on the beach was astonishing , remarkable , and the scene at Trevi Fountain with Anita Ekberg splashing in the water and summoning Marcello was a hoot . <p> " La Dolce Vita 's by Fellini , " Hermia corrected him . <p> He asked if she had sisters or brothers and if they all had such names . <p> She shook her head . <p> " An only child ? " <p> " Yes . " She stubbed out her cigarette . " At least it 's not Hermione . That 's what my father wanted . " Her fingernails were bitten , and her fingers long . <p> " Your father ... " <p> Consciously she changed the subject . " And you , are you an only child ? " <p> He shook his head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " But I 'm the oldest , so for four years I was an only child . Or felt like one ... " <p> She looked away , looked at the door . <p> " Tell me about The Flies " he said . <p> She did . She said The Flies was fun to do ; apparently the Germans never understood it as a protest play but allowed Sartre to mount it in occupied Paris . ' Ihey thought it an update of The Oresteia , which on the surface it was , but more importantly it 's an attack on fascist rule . The collaborator Aegisthus is a figure out of Vichy and a version of the Nazi stooge Le Marchal Petain , or maybe Pierre Lavai . Hermia liked stage managing and the Experimental Theatre , the small black box with risers that they called " The Ex . " The lighting designer was a friend , and she did n't mind the detail work , the lists of " To Do " and lists of " Done , " but the director was a horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cast . " We open next Thursday , " she told him . " Do you want to come ? " <p> He was twenty-one , she twenty , and both of them pretending to a worldliness they had not earned . She had traveled with her family to Italy and France . He had been to Mexico the previous summer and ingested peyote buttons and been violently ill ; the mushrooms were bitter and strong . His hallucinations were multicolored , dramatic ; the cactus he had focused on seemed ten feet tall . She had had three lovers and he five . <p> Her first had been in high school . Timmy wanted to be an airplane pilot , then a fighter pilot , and now that JFK had established a space program he would want to be an astronaut . They slept together twice , the week of graduation , and when she thought about him now she thought mostly about the blood on the couch of his family room , how she had rubbed and scrubbed at it while Timmy said , " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gallery owner exhibiting her father 's work who took her on a tour of Rome , then back to his apartment , where he seduced her efficiently , saying " Bella , que bella , bellisima " while they undressed . The next afternoon , however , when she went with her family to the gallery beneath the Spanish Steps , he acted as though nothing happened , as though they were polite strangers , and she never saw Giovanni again . <p> Her third affair was serious , and it had lasted all fall . Though Hermia had gotten over it , was getting over it , she sometimes thought that she and Bill were taking a break from each other , a not-so-romantic vacation , and would date again and marry down the line . Bill was in law school ; they 'd met at a mixer , and he drove an Austin-Healey and had reddish , curly hair she liked to run her fingers through ; at Thanksgiving he had introduced her to his parents and said , " Mom , this is the real deal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm , he explained , he was planning a career in politics ; he would make a run for the State House , and was sure he 'd be elected , and she 'd make an excellent wife . <p> He had it all planned out . He had no doubts at all . He had attended Exeter , and his family came from New Hampshire , and there was a seat in the State House that was going to be vacant ; with a pedigree like his-his uncle had been governorand a photogenic Radcliffe woman at his side , it would be a lead-pipe cinch . That was his phrase , a " lead-pipe cinch , " and Hermia respected his impermeable self-assurance but distrusted it also , disliked it , and when she told him so , he said , " Well I may have made a mistake , it 's possible I 'm wrong . " <p> " About getting elected ? " <p> " No . You . " <p> He announced this in bed , stubbing out a cigarette , and she felt herself go cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got up and walked to the window and covered herself with his blue button-down Oxford and stood looking out . There was snow on Boylston Street , and a red light changing to green ; a man across the street was walking two dogs at once . He stopped beneath a streetlight while the larger dog-a German shepherd , a husky ? - lifted his leg at the pole ; then the small one took his turn . <p> " Come back to bed , " said Bill . " You must be freezing , baby . " <p> " No . " <p> " No you wo n't come back to bed , or no you are n't freezing your ass off ? " <p> " The good citizens of New Hampshire , " she said , " expect their elected officials to marry a virgin and not to say ' ass . ' We both of us made a mistake . " <p> Now Lawrence was saying yes to The Flies , he 'd like to see the production next week , and what house did she live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you there ? he asked . And Hermia said , No , I 'll leave a ticket because I 'm at the theater hours before curtain , and I 'll see you after the show . He talked about the Dean of Architecture at MIT , an Italian called Pietro Belluschi , and how he was more interesting-so Lawrence said-than the Dean at Harvard , Jos Luis Sert . He talked about the aesthetics of Belluschi and Sert , how they differed and were similar , and what it would mean to study at Princeton instead . The best of them all was probably Yale , but he just was n't up for New Haven ; and in any case , he told her , he was planning on apprentice work , he wanted some experience in the professional world . He needed to be sure of architecture as a profession before committing himself to the course of study ; he was tired , tired , sick to death of school . There were architecture firms in New York or Chicago or even San Francisco where he could just do office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She studied him . His eyes were blue , his mouth was wide and mobile , and his cheekbones were pronounced . He had a way of talking-rapid , allusive-she liked . He was trying to impress her , and though she was unimpressed she liked how hard he tried . The coffee shop was filling up ; music played- " As Time Goes By " - and Hermia felt happy to be sitting at a table with this boy-man in a black turtleneck sweater and brown Harris Tweed . She picked at her croissant . She had not had a date since Bill- " Bill the pill , " Silvana called him-but that was three months ago and the mournful self-pity had passed . <p> Looking at her watch , she saw she had an hour left until the cast was scheduled for costume fittings at the Loeb . The costumes were either leotards or togas , black or white , and the actors moved a large red crown from head to head when power was transferred . She had been planning to go to her room and maybe get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and check out a monograph she needed for an essay for her Social Relations section . But this coffee together was pleasant , this Lawrence , whose last name she realized she did not know , was talking about architects , designers , advertising and technology and the city of the future while she shifted in her seat , adrift , and looked at the length of his hair . <p> " So how did it go ? " he asked . <p> " What ? " <p> " That test of yours . The one on Rubens . " <p> " We have n't got it back , " she said . " I did know Venus and Adonis " <p> He smiled at her . " And Actaeori* . " <p> " You were paying attention , " she said . <p> " I was , " he said , and smiled again , showing a gap in his teeth . <p> The Loeb Drama Center , newly built , housed a main stage and experimental theater ; The Flies , as a student production , had been allocated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with rocks suggesting both the fields of Argos and its palace . Rockpiles had been built out of canvas and wood , then covered with papier-mche . The director was a senior ; he had spent the previous summer in Paris researching Sartre , Artaud , and agitprop theatre , and he smoked Gauloises . On opening night Orestes came down with laryngitis , so the actor used a bullhorn . Everyone agreed the bullhorn was appropriate , a kind of threatful magnifier that made his " People of Argos " speech seem more totalitarian and demagogicfascist when he incited the mob . <p> It was the beginning of spring : March 21 . The snow gave way to sleet . After the performance , at the cast party in an apartment down the street from Cronin 's , the director passed a pipe . It came straight from Jamaica , he said , and on Sunday when the run was done and after they had struck the set , he 'd pull out all the chemical stops : They 'd have an existential no-holds-barred humongous celebration . But tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what The Crimson might say . The paper 's reviewer had given him a thumbs-up sign , and that was a good omen , but as far as he himself was concerned , what mattered was how each of them had played their parts , since-here he mimicked Jacques 's speech in As You Like It , lisping- " ' All the world'th a thtage . ' " <p> " But seriously , gang , " the director continued , " I 'm proud of you , how everyone stood and was counted and we 've " - now he raised the ponytail of the dancer he was sleeping with- " given our damnedest , our all " He balanced on a DR stool , holding a bottle of Mateus ros and slipping into a southern accent . " Dang " he said , " I 'm jes so dang proud of y all ! " Then he declared himself impressed by how they 'd pulled together , pulled it off ; and the director was , as the French say , if he said so himself , boulevers , pouvant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sartre , " said Lawrence , " is La Nause ? <p> Hermia laughed . " Well , what about No Exit ? " <p> " Is that an exit line ? " <p> " It is . " She slipped her arm through his . <p> Parietal hours were over , and they could not go to Cabot Hall or where Lawrence was living , a single room in Claverly . In any case , she told him , it felt too soon , too sudden . But she pressed against him when they kissed and , disengaging , stared at him wide-eyed ; he had an erection she grazed with her palm . <p> " Maybe we could see each other on Saturday ? Sunday ? " asked Lawrence , and she told him , " Yes . " <p> The moon was high , the stars emerged , and that promise stayed with him as he walked back to his room . He spent the next day on his thesis , a chapter on Palladio and his influence in Newport , the English manor house and French chteau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country living by the bay . Will called and said , " We heading out tomorrow ? " and Lawrence told him no . <p> They became lovers that weekend and stayed together all spring . He lived alone in Claverly Hall , in a wood-paneled sitting room with a sleeping alcove , on the building 's second floor . His windows gave out on an alley , and the light was poor . But Lawrence loved the privacy , the illusion of self-sufficiency , and when he brought Hermia up to his room he hoped she would approve of it : the reproductions of Van Gogh and the Mexican bark paintings he had acquired in San Miguel de Allende , the scrape on his bed and bookcases he had fashioned out of shelving and glass bricks . <p> When he thought of it , years later , he thought of it in pictures : a silent movie played out without language , in scenes . He saw the cowl-necked red sweater she wore , and the brown woolen skirt with the slit to the knee ; he saw the mascara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strap had frayed . He saw the two of them embracing by the wooden desk . In her leather boots she was taller than he , and when she bent to remove them he watched the blue vein at her ankle , the curve of her calf and then thigh . He had , and was embarrassed by , pimples on his back . He had a box of condoms in his bedside table , and when the time arrived to open them he was clumsy , fumbling , and remembered the way her hair cascaded darkly when she bent across him to help . <p> They talked ; they must have spoken , but what he remembered was silence and the bright whites of her eyes . His pillows were yellow , his blanket was green , and the rug on the floor was a full-size Flokati his mother had given him : long , tufted lambs ' wool dyed blue . He remembered the lamplight , the shadows it cast , and how he turned off the light . He remembered how Hermia paused , emerging from the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his side , the stretchmarks at her hip , the scar along her knee . He remembered in detail the shape of her breasts-the left was a little bit larger-and how her eyes closed when she sat on him , pumping , and the coils of pubic hair , and how her neck arched when she came . <p> The following Sunday they drove to the Cape , and she took him to her parents ' house-still closed down for the winter-and walked the path to Ballston Beach . The wind was blustery , the waves were high , and they sat together in the dunes while sand whipped past them , eddying . <p> " It 's beautiful . " <p> " I love it here , " said Hermia . " I love it , " and the word echoed between them ; she had not used it before . <p> Gulls rose and circled , then settled again , and white foam unfurled from the waves . She found the hidden house-key where her parents kept it , on the crossbeam of the overhang where the woodpile had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging pots and candles in wine bottles , its dried bunches of herbs tied to nails in the beam . The living room was long and low ; she led him past couches in sheets . Bookcases were stuffed with old leather-bound books , and the fireplace had logs laid in it crosswise and ready for burning . Paintings by her father 's friends covered all the walls . Lawrence recognized , or thought he did , a set of prints by Motherwell , a Kenneth Noland target painting , and a Hans Huffman oil . There was a landscape that looked like a Hopper-a yellow house athwart a green and ochre cliff-and later he would understand the value of the art he 'd seen so casually displayed , unheated , unprotected , but Hermia was leading him to her small bedroom by the porch . He pulled down his pants and she pulled off her panties and they came together standing up . It was quick and sharp and fierce , and in the sudden aftermath she rested her head on his shoulder . <p> " I 've never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not anyone . " <p> On the wall of her room , by the west-facing eave , hung a life-size portrait of Hermia herself when young-her skirt spread wide , her black hair splayed about her face-and playing with a golden retriever puppy on her lap . The picture had been painted with authority ; it was , he guessed , her fathers work . The girl on the wall had grown up . Yet the smile on her face then was how she smiled now : a proprietary , ease-filled gaze , a dallying . <p> " It is n't too cold in here , is it ? " she asked , and he told her no . <p> " Remember how you 'd been to Truro that first morning when we met ? " <p> " ' You were paying attention ... ' " <p> " Mi casa es su casa , " she said . <p> Wooden shutters with a heart cut out had been fastened at the windows , and through the heart-shaped apertures Lawrence saw the sky . They kissed . He felt , and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : so fortunate , luck 's shining child , this beauty in his arms . <p> At first the two of them were careful , spacing their encounters , but once a week gave way to twice and then to three meetings or four . By the end of April they met each other daily , drinking coffee at Hayes-Bick , walking along the Charles River or down Mass . Ave . for Chinese food and going to movies at night . They saw Ingmar Bergman and Antonioni and Hitchcock films , and he told her she looked like Monica Vitti when Monica Vitti wore a black wig . Lawrence completed his thesis on time , and she continued to go to her classes : " Social Relations 10 , " " The Baroque , " " The English Novel , " and " Shakespeare : the Late Plays . " All through the month of May Hermia left letters in his mailbox , or underneath his pillow ; and if they did not see each other at night or over the weekend-if she visited her family or he went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> On the telephone he told her he missed her , he could n't stop thinking about her . The scent of her perfume remained in his room , the smell of their sex on his hands . In May , and with her mother 's approval , she was fitted for a diaphragm ; they had a joke about " Most Happy Fella " and called it her " Big D. " She liked to imagine the child they would have , the way their children would look . Other companions fell away , and Hermia and Lawrence talked about the future : this summer when he would be graduated , the trips they hoped to take and how they would manage to do so , and where he planned to live . <p> She spoke about her father , the way he drank and unwound with his buddies at cards , playing high-stakes poker the whole night long and smoking cigars , and how he swore and terrified her as a child . The golden retriever , Tigger , became her pet the year she 'd had an operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The knee was fine , completely fixed , but that explained the scar he 'd noticed and was tracing with his tongue . <p> She talked about her fathers art , his fame , and how he demanded attention , admiration ceaselessly , so everything about dear Dad was me , me , me , me , me . Their apartment in Brooklyn was a disaster , with hot water only sometimes when the landlord fixed the plumbing , and a bathtub in the kitchen and nobody bothering to make the beds or take the garbage out . Still , it had an upstairs studio with a worldclass view of Manhattan , and Hermia 's mother seemed content to live in what once had been a warehouse , drinking Campari and soda and posing for her artist friends and being written about in the New York Times and being called everyone 's muse . <p> Lawrence talked about his mother , the rigid propriety of his family home and how the suburbs seemed the absolute opposite of what she described in Brooklyn Heights . His father , a banker , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood , an absence with martinis and the Wall Street Journal in the TV room . His father wore bow ties and button-down shirts and was unfailingly polite to strangers , at ease on the golf course and tennis court and in the club car of the train . The hedges by their house were clipped , the stones that lined the driveway painted white . <p> But then his father left when Lawrence turned eighteen . One Friday evening in October he did not return from work , and that was the end of it . There was nothing to do or to say . His father took an apartment in Gramercy Park , filling the closets with his suits and setting out his photographs on the table in the foyer . There was a silver-framed photograph of Lawrence at his high-school graduation , a photograph of the three children in their tennis whites , and a series of sepia portraits of parents and grandparents standing with horses or at their ease in evening clothes or poised with skis on a ski slope . <p> Lawrence became his mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother and sister were too young , but he was old enough to listen over Thanksgiving or Christmas vacation while she raged on and on about unfairness and that SOB , excuse me , who used to call this place home . Their father , it turned out , was having affairs , and one of the girls in the office got pregnant and would n't have an abortion , and his father did " the right and honorable thing , " as his mother , dripping with sarcasm , chose to call it : The right honorable SOB left his wife and children to marry a teller instead . Well , maybe she was n't a teller , maybe a branch manager or executive vice-president ; but Lawrences mother had been certain she worked her way up the corporate ladder by spreading her legs , lying down . <p> So the family remained in Scarsdale , in the mock-Tudor gabled house , but all the king 's horses and all the king 's men-the cash and property transfer and alimony payments-could n't put them together again . His brother applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , putting the whole continent between himself and Westchester . His sister AlHe was sixteen and did n't need a plane to leave ; she lay all day long in her canopy bed , so busy with the telephone she could n't really tell you if it was afternoon or evening or when midnight came . The lights turned on or off , the music played , and downstairs in the kitchen his mother beat at scrambled eggs or pounded a veal cutlet flat and scrubbed the kitchen counters in a kind of vengeful fury . <p> They agreed they came from different worlds but not so far apart the distance was unbridgeable ; besides , said Hermia , it 's too much fun doing the bridging . He laughed . She had a sense of humor that took him by surprise ; she was sly and slantways in her wit , and she liked to tease him . She signed her nightly letters " Huntley/Brinkley " when sending him the day 's report . One of the notes she left in his bed was a folded page of paper : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suck your great big hard beautiful sweet-tasting , and , on the inside fold , ear . <p> That year at Harvard , two teachers-Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert-were distributing psilocybin and instructing students to keep journals of their sensations and thoughts and perceptions while high . " The Doors of Perception , " as Aldous Huxley called them , had opened wide , and LSD became the drug of choice . At Club 47 on Mt . Auburn Street , Joan Baez and Tom Rush and curlyhead Bob Dylan sang folk songs alone or together . The world was young , or so it seemed , the world was theirs to conquer , although conquering was not the point , and neither Hermia nor Lawrence wanted to divide and conquer but only to remain together and lie down together in bed . <p> In years to come they were not certain what went wrong between them . There was no single reason that they broke apart . He was twenty-one , she twenty , and they were not ready for marriage and could not live together in the fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , he told himself , than the chill insularity of Cambridge .

It 's time to move on , move along .... " <p> His friend Will , who lived on Irving Street , was fat and had a high-pitched voice and a cheap guitar . He played the instrument well , however . At night in his dark basement he had parties and sang : " I 'm going away , for to stay , a little while . But I 'm coming back , if I go ten thousand miles . . . .

" Hey pretty lady , little darlin , ' " he said , " that first tune was for you ! " <p> She was going to be a senior and could not leave Cambridge , and though she and Lawrence promised each other they would stay together and it would make no difference , it did make a difference . He found himself wondering where else to go and what else to do ; Will said he was pussy-whipped and ought to hit the road . At a party in a carriage barn behind a red brick mansion on Fayerweather Street , he got drunk on bad sangria and found himself in a bedroom kissing a girl called Charette , a girl with whom he 'd studied the Italian Renaissance , and when he pulled away from her she said , " Do n't stop ; why stop ? " <p> Thick-tongued he explained to her , or tried to , that he was at the party with his girlfriend Hermia , downstairs , and Charette said , " Why does that matter ? " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared . " You can join us if you want to , " said Charette , and Lawrence was so shocked he laughed . And that was what , said Hermia , she could n't forgive : his complicit drunken laughter and the way she felt , oh , not so much insulted as dismissed . <p> To make him jealous , therefore , or at least to demonstrate what it was like , she called Bill to congratulate him on having finished law school , and Bill said , " Hey , baby , I was thinking about you , this is great . " <p> " Great ? " she asked him , but was flattered , nevertheless , that he was thinking about her , or bothered to lie . And when he asked , " Are you busy ? Are you free tonight ? I 've just tuned up the growler and was planning on a spin , " she said , " All right , OK .

She had been reading Othello , and she knew that Shakespeare meant the Moor to love " not wisely but too well , " and that the Moor of Venice had been driven half-insane . " ' Beware , my lord , of jealousy , ' " she found herself reciting , " ' it is the green-eyed monster . ' " Except jealousy was not the point , and she was n't playing Iago or the part of Desdemona ; she was being driven fast down Storrow Drive in a convertible with an old boyfriend , catching up . <p> Fidelity meant faithfulness ; it meant wanting only one thing . It meant there was no difference between what you had and what you wanted , no space between the space you occupied and where you hoped to be . But nothing was ever so simple , she knew ; what would happen , for example , if you desired more than one person or thing ? This became a problem ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in , said Silvana 's European history professor , " The Age of Anxiety , " and one of the anxieties engendered by freedom is the problem of multiple choice . <p> She had planned to be faithful forever ; she had wanted to love only Lawrence . But he never did say that he loved her , he never could quite get around to the words , and she was tired not so much of waiting as of his close-mouthed caution , his timidity . When she thought about the bedroom on Fayerweather Street , him laughing with that girl upstairs-her eyes like pinwheels and skirt down around her ankles-she thought she could never forgive him , and so she drove away with Bill to the North End for dinner and made herself forget . Hermia 's father was a famous man , her mother a great beauty , and she herself was finishing her junior year at Radcliffe . She was tired of multiple choice . Integrity meant oneness ; it meant staying faithful and true to yourself , and she would return , she told herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
