Ken Altabef is a healer by trade , plying , his trade in the New York environs . With this story , his first professional sale , you 've got to hand it to him for cowing up with an interesting new take on an age-old subject . <p> IT WAS A RIDICULOUS NOTION of course , but at the time I was a writer and ridiculous notions were my stock in trade . Worse yet , I was a fantasist . Daydreams and dalliances , wondrous armies of mechanical men , entire civilizations etched onto the head of a pin , mighty dragons and mightier kings - you name it , all rustling about in that crowded little space between my ears . Calcimine castles in the air accessible only by the Pegasus of my imagination , I had but to open the floodgates and let them pour forth . So it was not at all unusual for a bit of superstition to make its way into my reality . It was not at all unusual for me to obsess over some petty piece of daily business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportions . case in point : a handshake , and a famous man . A simple handshake . A ritual performed so often and with so little conscious thought as to be practically an instinctual reflex . Although the exact origin is difficult to pinpoint , there is a widespread belief that in its oldest form the handshake signified the handing of power from a god to an early Egyptian ruler . Centuries later , it was this magical aspect of the handshake that was so magnificently rendered on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel . In Medieval times , it might mean anything from a friendly greeting to a quick check for concealed weapons . In the twenty-first century , the handshake had evolved into an important social custom ; a symbol of honor and good faith , it " sealed the deal . " But could it be magic ? What exactly was exchanged in that special moment of personal interaction - a little sweat , some exfoliated skin cells , a warm fuzzy feeling . What else ? MAGICAL ? I SUPPOSE you could say he was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sixteen bestsellers in as many years , one or two of them still clinging like drowning sailors to the bottom of the sales chart as the newest blockbuster hit the top . Works as varied in genre as was possible : gothic horror , two-fisted adventure , a sizzling midsummer romance , even a couple of high-tech medical thrillers . His wellspring of ideas was inexhaustible , his imagination boundless , his research always impeccable . To read his works you actually believed he was an arctic explorer , a gigolo , part Mafia hitman , part Caribbean pirate , a sorcerer supreme , a retired brain surgeon , and a WWI flying ace . His characters were always convincing , his plots wildly original and yet they always rang true with details as finely honed as real experience . I 'm sure you get the picture . As a fledgling novelist , he was my idol . He was everything I wanted to be . I first saw Eldritch speak on the campus at Hof stra . He was delivering a diatribe on the importance of energy in writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he dashed back and forth , buzzing around the drama club 's makeshift stage like a honeybee at an orchid convention . He was the picture of crackling exuberance . His footsteps set the old wood to creaking , if not with the weight of his stature then with the force of his ideas . He was quite a sight - a diminutive five-footer with a receding shock of unkempt sandy hair that refused to lie in any conventional manner across his scalp , a set of flailing arms , and a pair of wild dark eyes . Unrestrained energy seemed to shoot out from him in tiny electric bolts , invigorating the ravenous and adoring crowd as he poured forth humorous anecdotes and evocative tales of his early career . He had the crowd on its knees . An unfailing eruption of enthusiastic laughter punctuated his every punch line . It was hard to picture the legendary Harold Eldritch as a fledgling news reporter struggling to choke out a few lines of prose after-hours on a secondhand Smith Corona and yet , an accomplished raconteur , he painted the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he opened up the floor to questions from the audience . The sea of faces that gathered tightly ahout the author were as varied as his oeuvre , ranging from geriatrics to housewives to the usual collegiate types , with some longshoremen , Hindu mystics , circus freaks , and a few disenfranchised pagan deities thrown in for good measure . Inevitably he was asked the one question that all successful writers dread , and are pestered with at every turn : Just where did he get all those wonderful ideas ? He rolled his eyes and laughed , characteristically waving his hands in the air . He was glad to explain . He had made a deal with the Devil , - he had stumbled upon Edgar Rice Burroughs 's lost steamer trunk stuffed with manuscripts ; he received messages via Ouija board , - he depended upon a vast store of remembrances of past lives ; HE HAD AN INTENSE RELATIONSHIP WITH A VERY CREATIVE GNOME ! ! Where did he get his ideas ? Next question . After the lecture , the crowd shuffled its way into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember what novel , or two or three , he was hawking at that time ; it was ten years ago now and there have been an endless stream of them even to this day . But whatever it was , I had a copy tucked in the crook of my arm , and I braved the seemingly endless line of sycophants waiting to meet the man . During the long wait my excitement steadily grew , as I pondered and obsessed over my insidious , ridiculously superstitious plan . You see , I 'd gotten this idea into my head - a crazy , childish notion as I 've already said - but it had burrowed its way into my brain nonetheless . I thought that if I could just shake his hand , the hand that had pumped so much creativity into his typewriter ( he did n't believe in word processors , that maybe a little bit of the magic would rub off on me . I 'd written a few stories , won a couple of local awards and one national contest , and I felt I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had the talent and I had the ideas , all I was lacking were the years of hard work necessary to refine the style , and hard work never seemed much of a valid contender next to a magical shortcut . So I wanted that handshake . Silly me . I waited patiently as the line crawled forth . Every so often , leaning out to check my progress , I would spy the great author himself seated at a cheap folding table at the end of the hallway . At last it was my turn . I must confess to a certain inotropic thumping of my heart as I stepped toward the table . I towered over him , but he smiled paternally up at me as I extended my hand . He extended his , and there it was , the long-awaited moment of contact . Our hands grappled firmly for a moment as if undertaking the first grip of an arm-wrestling match , and then it was over . Had I felt a little spark of electricity pass between us in that brief pressing of the flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or simply the shag carpet and my sneakers talking ? There was no time to contemplate that now , I was face to face with Harold Eldritch and the silence was growing uncomfortable . What to say ? What to say ? " It 's truly a pleasure to meet you , sir , " I managed . " It 's a pleasure being met , " he quipped , a practiced retort he had probably used countless times before when faced with the same pedantic line . Then I stared at him for a moment , ridiculous fanboy that I was , totally unprepared as to what to say next . You see , I had n't rehearsed the next line , and I began running all the obligatory responses through my mind in whipsaw fashion . Should I tell him I have read all his books ? Should I say I 'm one of his biggest fans ? Should I fall over myself complimenting everything he 'd ever done ? The myriad obvious , hackneyed possibilities that presented themselves left me speechless . I wished I had a really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find myself awash in a sea of nothing but trite blather . He smiled impatiently for a moment and then rescued me . " A writer ... right ? " he asked , still smiling , an index finger poised straight up in the air , punctuating his deduction . " Yeah , " I said . " Well , keep at it , son ! " he advised , slapping me playfully on the shoulder and gently pushing me along with the same deft movement . Next customer . I shuffled off . fust another aspiring writer in a vast sea of aspiring writers . Well , that was the great meeting with the great Harold Eldritch . I made my way to the exit , and I never saw him again , except for a quick glance back from the gymnasium door . There he was still working the crowd , smiling wildly , shaking all those hands . IT 'S TEN YEARS on now . I 'm a modestly successful accountant at a small North Jersey firm . Needless to say , my great writing career did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write at all anymore . I have n't penned a short story in eight or nine years . Not even a poem , a ditty , or an ode . No , I 'll never be another Harold Eldritch . I 'll never have one bestseller to my credit , let alone a string of a hundred . He 's still pumping them out , magnificently working his old-school typewriter on the ranch in sunny CA , still speaking engagements to the thrill of young writers everywhere . Still shaking hands . I know how to write , mind you . I 've still got the knack , can still gild the lily , can still turn a phrase . No trouble there , but there 's one tiny little damnably insurmountable problem . I can put the words together , but I ca n't come up with a story worth squat . Man , I 've tried and I 've scavenged and I 've searched but there 's not one original idea left in my head . I never saw Harold Eldritch again . I never wanted to see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you get all those wonderful ideas ?
