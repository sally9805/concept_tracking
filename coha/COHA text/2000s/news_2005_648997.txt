<p> The pregame was easy for Bruce C. Ratner . <p> Ratner , the principal owner of the Nets , chatted with team officials over a turkey dinner Wednesday night at the Winners Club restaurant inside Continental Arena , then greeted Magic Johnson and Richard J. Codey , the acting governor of New Jersey , at courtside . <p> Fans reached out with their hands and suggestions . Ratner strolled through the new prefabricated Nissan Courtside Club to mingle with elite seat-holders , as well as Jason Kidd 's wife , Joumana , as they supped on frankfurters and popcorn . <p> Then he suffered  --  quietly . He sat unobtrusively , usually with his arms folded over his chest , as the Lakers erased the Nets ' 12-point fourth-quarter lead . He wondered about the identity of these largely nameless Lakers , who were showing perseverance without the injured Kobe Bryant . <p> " Who are these guys ? " he said . <p> With each missed Nets shot , Ratner uttered a barely audible , " Oh , no . " When the Lakers ' Chucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head sadly in disbelief . <p> In overtime , when Caron Butler 's 3-pointer put the Lakers ahead for good , 102-101 , Ratner emitted a pained , " Unnhhh . " <p> With the score at 104-101 with 36 seconds left , Ratner , a tiny , rueful smile creasing his round face , said : " Anything can happen on any given night in sports . But I still do n't like it . " <p> When the game ended in the Nets ' 28th loss of the season , Ratner slapped his right thigh , exhaled and said : " I 've got a sinking feeling . It 's far better to win . " <p> Praying for Vince Carter to hit a buzzer beater is a new feeling for Ratner , who is 60 . He was not an especially knowledgeable fan when he bought the Nets last year and was painted by critics as a developer who dipped into basketball only to move the team to a new Brooklyn arena by 2007 or 2008 and make a big real estate score . <p> It may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been community opposition to his plan to build the arena and surrounding residential and commercial buildings , as well as discontent about how he has pursued his goal . <p> Norman Siegel , a lawyer for Develop Do n't Destroy , said that Ratner had not provided enough information to neighborhoods about the project . <p> " Ideally , " Siegel said , " a developer would reach out and meet with people and disclose his plans in detail so the people affected would understand what 's happening . " <p> But Bruce Bender , an executive vice president of Ratner 's company , Forest City Ratner , said : " We 've gone above and beyond to meet with the community . We 've met with all the community boards . We 've never turned down anyone . We have been very open . To say we have n't is wrong , deceitful and outrageous . " <p> Forest City Ratner is the development partner of The New York Times Company in building a new headquarters in Manhattan on Eighth Avenue between 40th and 41st streets . For Ratner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ferocious reaction to the Nets ' trading Kenyon Martin to Denver last summer , which Ratner subsequently called a mistake . After the Nets then traded Kerry Kittles , Jason Kidd said he wanted to leave . <p> The criticism was unlike anything Ratner had encountered as the commissioner of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs from 1978 to 1982 and as an urban developer . Both jobs , he said , had positive elements to them , but lacked the renown of owning a sports team . <p> " It was difficult for me the first three months , but it was a good trial by fire , " he said . " I was horribly criticized . I got used to thickening my skin . " <p> He said that he had atoned for much of the media and fan savaging when Rod Thorn , the Nets ' president , and Ed Stefanski , the general manager , traded for Vince Carter . Ratner said that deal symbolized his belief that a solid organization , like his real estate company , could rebound with smart decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so quickly , that I 'd be proven right , " he said . <p> The impression that Ratner 's intentions were purely real-estate driven was exacerbated by his status as a neophyte basketball fan . His sports memories reflect his upbringing in Cleveland  --  his love of the football Browns , and his first baseball game , the 1-0 no-hitter pitched by the Yankees ' Allie Reynolds against the Indians in 1951 . <p> " My father bought tickets for Game 5 of the 1954 World Series , " he said , but the Indians , who won 111 games that season , were swept by the Giants . " When the Indians were last in the World Series , I made sure to buy tickets for Game 5 . " ( The Marlins won the ' 97 World Series in seven games . ) <p> To elevate his knowledge of basketball , Ratner plays the NBA Live video game on his computer ; trolls the Internet for news and statistics ; and bought the league 's pay-per-view games on the N.B.A. 's League Pass subscription service . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare for our game on Friday , " he said . " I 'm learning . Until 1983 , I did n't know a thing about real estate . " <p> Thorn , who has spent 40 years in the National Basketball Association as a player and an executive , said : " He 's become a fan . He knows more about the game than he did before . " <p> Ratner 's challenges are hardly related to whether he can recite Wilt Chamberlain 's free-throw percentage on the night he scored 100 points . It is , however , crucial that he build up the franchise in the years before the move to Brooklyn . Attendance is down this season by nearly 4 percent , to an average of 14,952 a game . Empty seats were noticeable Wednesday night throughout the arena . For most of the first half , there were five empty seats right in front of Ratner 's . <p> " It does n't break my heart , " he said . " It 's not whole empty sections . But when I look at N.B.A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> To maintain and add revenue , Ratner hired Brett Yormark , a former Nascar executive , as president of the team 's parent company ; created the Courtside Club from unused space near the basketball court 's entrance ; added areas for sponsor hospitality ; reduced the price of 3,000 upper-tier seats to $15 ; initiated a postgame concert series ; and distributes free tickets to deserving high school students . <p> During Wednesday 's game , about 50 students from Thomas Jefferson High School in the East New York section of Brooklyn left their upper-level seats to meet Ratner , one after another , thanking him for their tickets . <p> Ratner said he was not concerned that reducing ticket prices or giving away a substantial number of tickets would hurt his bottom line . " Eighty percent of the revenues is in 20 percent of the seats in the lower bowl , " he said . <p> He refused to divulge the state of the team 's finances and said that before he sells the future in Brooklyn , he will build revenue in a market that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some extent , be left behind . <p> " I do n't accept that we ca n't substantially improve our business with the right product , " he said . <p> He added , " With the right product , you can mess up the marketing . " <p> One aspect of improved marketing is the imminent hiring of Marv Albert to call about 50 Nets games for the YES Network next season . Drawing Albert , a Brooklyn native , who is closely identified with the Knicks after calling their games for 35 years before leaving the MSG Network last June , is a public relations coup for the Nets . <p> Ian Eagle , who has called Nets game for 11 years , is deciding whether to accept a diminished role of about 30 games . <p> " Ian is very good , " Ratner said . " But Marv is the gold-plated standard . It 's our philosophy to get the very best people . I think I 'm doing the right thing . There 'll be some negative reaction about Ian , but it will turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was little positive in the Nets ' locker room after Wednesday 's loss . <p> Ratner walked slowly from player to player , saying , " Tough loss . " Not one looked up at him . <p> Ratner seemed forlorn when he walked out and decided against going back in to console Coach Lawrence Frank . <p> " I 'm going to replay this game in my head , " he said , before driving off in the rainy night in his chauffeured Lexus . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com Bruce C.
