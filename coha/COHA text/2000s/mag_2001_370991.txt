Paul Tagliabue was right . When the National Football League commissioner saw a model of the Cincinnati Bengals ' new home  --  which abandoned the typical concrete bowl for a gleaming pair of crescent-shaped stands , he gushed , " It 's going to take the NFL stadium to a new level . " As proof , the project garnered national design awards , and its creators , Dan Meis and Ron Turner , have been hired to build or renovate a dozen high-profile sports arenas as well as brainstorm over the future of the mother ship , Madison Square Garden . <P> Meis and Turner , part of the architectural firm NBBJ Sports and Entertainment , serve up technical prowess  --  Meis ' multiuse miracle in Japan transforms a 5,000-seat theater into a 20,000-seat arena or a 30,000-seat stadium at the touch of a few buttons  --  as well as simple strokes of genius , like turning hard-to-fill corner seats at the Philadelphia Eagles ' upcoming stadium into courtyards where fans can socialize  --  and shell out cash . <P> With stadiums having maxed out revenues from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsors to generate more dollars for team owners .

When designing the first Major League Soccer stadium in the U.S. , for the Columbus Crew in Ohio , they made sure concession stands faced the field .
