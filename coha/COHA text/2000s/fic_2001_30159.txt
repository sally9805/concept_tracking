The Rambler 's headlights caught a scrap of paper nailed to a tree , a handwritten sign : repent . Darkness swallowed it , and Anna was left with the feeling she was surely on the road to perdition . God knew it was dark enough . Her high beams clawed the grass on the left side of the narrow lane , plowing a furrow so green it looked unnatural : neon green , acid green . At least it 's in color , she thought sourly . Everything she knewor imagined she didabout Mississippi had been gleaned from grainy black-and-white television footage of the civil rights movement in the sixties . Her worldly goods in a U-Haul , a shrieking Piedmont in a cat carrier , and an ever-faithful , if occasionally disgusting , hound drooling on her thigh , she 'd driven straight through from Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado . Twenty-two hours . And she 'd done it the old-fashioned way : without drugs . Caffeine did n't count , and six hours north of Dallas-Fort Worth it had quit having any appreciable effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if one was to be a night in a motel room with Piedmont . Anna poked a finger through the wire door of the carrier buckled into the passenger side of the bench seat . Taco , the black lab she 'd inherited after she 'd killed her dear friend and Taco 's mistress , insisted on squashing his seventy-five pounds between her and the cat . Wearily celebrating this sign of life from his mistress , he brushed his rubbery tail over her wrist where she reached across him . Piedmont would n't even bat at her finger . Eyes squeezed shut , he howled . " We 're almost there , " she said plaintively . " Don'tyou want to rest your throat ? " Taco 's tail thumped . Piedmont yowled . " Suit yourself . " Anna rolled down the window in the hope that the wind would ameliorate the wailings . Her eyes burned . It was too early and too late . It was pitch dark . It was April 15 . She had n't paid her income taxes , and she was in Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her from taking up Piedmont 's lament . Another hand-printed sign , this one riddled with bullet holes , flashed out of the night : repent . final warning . Ten miles back , Anna 'd started having a bad feeling . Now it was worse . This was not at all what she 'd expected the fast track to look like . At forty-five , she 'd finally heeded the ticking of her bureaucratic clock . The appeal of living out her dotage on a GS-9 field ranger 's salary had begun to wane . Time had come to plan for the day she 'd no longer want to sleep on the ground , swing a pulaski or argue with violent unsavory types . Promotions were not easily had in the National Park Service . First , one had to scour the pink sheets for a job opening one GS level above that currently held . Then one had to have , or fake , the KSAsknowledge , skills and abilitiescalled for in the desired position . What made a good ranger at Kenai Fiords might be totally useless at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application . The government then fiddled around in mysterious ways until half the hopefuls died of old age or went on to other jobs . With luck and timing , an offer eventually came . Given the givens , it was n't a good career move to turn a promotion down . For Anna , the call had come from the Deep South ; she had been offered a GS-11 district ranger position in the Port Gibson District of the Natchez Trace Parkway , the section that ran from Jackson to Natchez , Mississippi , ninety miles through the heart of one of the poorest counties in one of the poorest states in the union . " You 'll feel better when the sun rises , " she promised herself . " Surely the sun rises even in Mississippi . " Taco slathered reassurance on her kneecap . The air through the window was cool but lacked bite . There 'd been snow on the ground when she 'd driven down off the mesa above Cortez . Heady scents she did n't recognize swept the cab free of the odor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not clear the head as the scent of pine or rain on the desert did . Smell was primal . This stirred an image deep in Anna 's subconscious . Hunched over the wheel , eyes on the writhing black strip of asphalt , she waited as it struggled up through the layers of fatigue : Dorothy 's poppy field , Toto , the lion , the girl , tumbling down in a narcotic dream on the outskirts of the Emerald City . Flashes of green , unfurling black ; the road had a mystic sameness that was stultifying . Maybe she should have stayed on Interstate 20 to Clinton , Mississippi , as the chief ranger had instructed , instead of following the tortuous directions for a shortcut she 'd gotten when she called one of her soon- to-be field rangers in Port Gibson , a jovial fellow who called himself Randy . She rolled the window up . With the sandman already in hot pursuit , the last thing she needed was a hypnotic . The road coiled around on itself in a hairpin turn . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rambler , then drifted , slewing the car to the right . She slammed on the brakes . Taco slid to the floor , clawing her leg in a last bid for stability . The tail was wagging the dog both inside the Rambler and out . Anna stopped fighting the wheel and steered into the skid as if she was on black ice . In the hectic instant that followed , headlights slicing impossible colors from the night , animal caterwauling foretelling the end of the world , it crossed her mind that black ice was a thing of the past . What would replace it in the way of hazard and adventure , she had yet to find out . Soundlessly , painlessly , the trailer left the road , dragging the rear wheels of the Rambler with it . The coupled vehicles came to a stop with nary a bump . The car tilted unpleasantly and the red-lighted trailer in the rearview mirror held a drunken pose . " Everybody okay ? " Anna 's voice shook , and she was glad only furry and therefore sympathetic ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat , his untrimmed nails doing the aging vinyl no favors . The engine had died . Anna rested her head on the steering wheel . Regardless of the situation , it was good to be still . Silence , after twenty hours of radio , trucks , tapes and the high- pitched whine of rubber on pavement , hit like the first drink on an empty stomach . Something warm and wet and vile penetrated her ear , and she remembered she was a dog owner . " Two seconds , " she begged . The tongue insinuated itself into her armpit and Anna gave up . Having pulled the leash from under the cat carrier , she fought the usual battle to overcome the dog 's joy at a potential walk long enough to clip it to his collar . " Me first , " she insisted , and in a fit of good manners Taco waited till she 'd slid clear and stood on shaky legs before bounding out the driver 's door . The leash slipped from fingers numbed from too long clutching the wheel , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U-Haul . " Do n't go chasing ' coons or whatever the hell dogs chase down here , " she muttered . Outside the car , silence was shattered . Stunned by the sheer magnitude of sound , Anna leaned on the door and listened . A chorus , a choir , a nation of frogs sang from darkness curtained close by trees . Wide and deep , the sound chortled , chirped , tickled underfoot , overhead , from every direction . Basso profundo croaks , rough and guttural , were buoyed up by a cacophony of lesser notes . Big croaks . Big damn frogs , she thought . Or alligators . She 'd seen live free-range alligators a few times when she 'd been on assignment on Cumberland Island off the coast of Georgia , but they had n't uttered a word in her presence . Without questioning it , she 'd come away with the idea gators were dumb . Maybe that was n't so . Mississippi had a whole new natural history she would have to learn . Big frogs , she decided for the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to see what , if any , damage had been done . One step and she was on her butt , amazed and outraged but otherwise unhurt . Wet grass lay over earth as liquid and slippery as warm Jell-O . A good surface to take a fall on . A foul surface to try and pull an over-loaded trailer off of- - or out of , as the case might be . Using the door , she pulled herself upright . Slipping and grabbing in a parody of a vintage Jerry Lewis routine , she made it around the Rambler 's hood and onto the asphalt . By the glare of the headlights she saw she was covered from the elbows down in caramel-colored liquid . Taco padded up next to her , grinning in idiotic doggie bliss . " We 're not in the desert anymore , Taco , " she said , paraphrasing Dorothy 's observation as she wrenched open the passenger door to fumble under the seat for a towel and a flashlight . Piedmont had not stopped complaining . " You 're getting on my very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained unimpressed . Flashlight and towel in hand , she closed the door on the vocalization of feline suffering . The towel smelled of things that had once been on the inside of the cat and the flashlight beam was only slightly less brown than the Mississippi mud , but it would suffice . Taco danced like a puppy , though Anna figured him to be five or six at least , then dashed off to the rear of the little caravan , yipping and grumbling as if the news was not good for humans but extremely entertaining for dogs . Anna followed , her moccasins squishing at each step . Frog music , velvet darkness , and perfumed air all closed around her , and the walk of twenty feet took on a bizarre timelessness . She 'd been too long on the road . At the back of the U-Haul she stopped and stared . Taco leapt about with glee . " This ca n't be right , " she said stupidly . Caught in the demon eyes of the taillights , a tree , a foot in diameter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailer . Leafy boughs embraced the orange and white metal . Roots poked out of the ground , bent and angry as arthritic hands where the tree had been uprooted by the force of impact . Except there 'd been no impact . Nothing but a gentle slide into this oblivion of sentient and predatory plant materials . Had she dozed off behind the wheel ? She did n't think so , but it was n't out of the realm of possibility . Too dull with lack of sleep to do much else , she played her pathetic light over the rear of the trailer . No scrapes , no dents , therefore no impact . Unfortunately , logic had no effect on the tree . A locust , she guessed , twenty- five or thirty feet tall , had her vehicles in a death grip . If she pulled forward , the half-buried roots would act as an anchor and she 'd dig herself into the slime . Back , and she 'd ram the topmost branches down over the trailer and onto the roof of the car . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stood a moment hoping things would be different . She could unhitch the trailer , drive off and return for itor what was left of itwith the proper equipment . Assuming the Natchez Trace Parkway had the proper equipment . Home was in that white and orange box , and a deep unsettling unease boiled up at the thought of leaving it on the side of a strange road in a strange land . " Shit , " she reiterated . Headlights rounded the corner from the direction she 'd come . In proper rabbit fashion , she stared into them . Engine noise and the metallic complaint of a derelict truck momentarily quieted the frogs . Fear , not even a thought before , sprang full-blown from some Yankee collective unconscious . James Dickey and Burt Reynolds , Ned Beatty and " squeal like a pig . " Mississippi Burning , " I have a dream , " and chain gangs in the cotton fields . Nothing personal , nothing even secondhand , yet Anna had been fed a nightmare of the rednecked heart of Dixie . The truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toxic cloud of exhaust . A plaid-covered elbow hung out the window . Above it , thrust into the pale beam of Anna 's flash , was a round face under a beat-up ball cap . " Lady , you look to be in a whole heap of hurt . " The voice was thick , its owner talking around a wad of chewing tobacco the size of a golf ball . Anna blinked , waiting to see if her leg was being pulled or if he really talked that way . " A whole heap of hurt , " he repeated . " Looks like it , " she said . Taco wandered back to resume guard dog duties . He leaned against her muddy thigh , beating a canine welcome on the bumper with his tail . " Hunter ? " the moon-pie face asked . " Tourist , " Anna said , too tired to explain about jobs and transfers . The man 's pale face split into a laugh , and Anna saw , or thought she saw , streaks of tobacco juice on his teeth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box . The thought comforted her as she edged in that direction . " What did she say , Baby ? " a creaking voice cut through the one-sided hilarity . " Tourist . " Ancient laughter crackled from the window , leaking around the man Anna could see . " Not you , " the driver managed , merriment abated . " Your dog . He a huntin ' dog ? " " Tourist , " Anna said again . " What , Baby ? " " Tourist dog , Daddy . " Much laughter . Anna found herself inclined to join in but was afraid it would turn to hysteria . " Get on with it , Baby . I got work to do , " came a querulous creaking from the invisible passenger . The round face sobered , the wad of chaw was more securely stowed in the cheek and " Baby " got down to business . " Daddy wants to know if y'all need a hand . " By way of reply , Anna shined her failing light on the locust clutching her trailer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absurd , and she laughed . " You would n't happen to have a chainsaw on you , would you ? " Baby looked at her as if she was a half-wit , then said to the darkness beyond his shoulder : " Lady needs a chainsaw , Daddy . " Anna heard the unhappy notes of bent metal being forced as the passenger door of the truck opened and closed . Taco whined and wagged . Rummaging noises emanated from the pickup bed , then an old mansomewhere between sixty and biblicalcame around the end of the truck , red brake lights lending his shrunken cheeks and spindly silhouette a devilish cast . In his left hand was a chainsaw with a twenty-four-inch blade . " Whatcher need cut ? That tree you backed on into ? " Anna was torn between efficiency and dignity . Efficiency lost . " I did n't back into it , " she defended herself . " I slid ever so gently into the muck and , bingo , a tree was on me . " Pretty lame , but it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , leaving her no wiser . " Melts like sugar . Back the truck up , Baby . You 're just an accident waitin ' to happen . Back on up now , " he admonished sharply as the younger man started to pull ahead . " Git those headlights on the job . You know that . " Gears grated , meshed , and the truck lumbered back till the headlights threw the old man , the trailer and the tree into garish relief . Anna shaded her eyes from the glare and watched as , one-handed , Daddy drop-started the chainsaw and began cutting away the locust , smaller branches first . Baby , out of the truck so Anna could see the full effect , wore overalls over a plaid shirt and heavy boots . As his father cut , he swamped , hauling away the branches , some as big around as Anna 's leg . Early on she offered to help but was warned she 'd get herself " all over poison ivy " and so desisted . Pride was one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once and counted herself among the sadder but wiser girls . The tree was quickly disposed of . A chain , appearing from the same rubble of necessities that had camouflaged the chainsaw , was hooked around the Rambler 's bumper , and fifteen minutes start to finish , Baby and Daddy had Anna back on the road . Sensing an offer of money would be offensive , she thanked them by volunteering information about herself , an intellectual breaking of bread to indicate trust and a willingness to share as they had shared their time and strength with her . " I got a job on the Natchez Trace , " she told them after giving her name . " I 'm working for the Park Service there in Port Gibson . " She was careful not to mention she was in law enforcement . Either it made people feel as if they had to take a stand on the gender issue or it inspired them to relate every story they 'd ever heard where a cop had done somebody dirt . Still , Baby and Daddy looked blank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said at last . The old man leaned on the front of the pickup , the single working headlight shining past his scrawny red- cotton-covered chest in a rural depiction of the sacred heart painting that hung in the hall of Mercy High , where Anna had attended boarding school . " Then what 're you doing in these parts beside getting yourself stuck ? " It was Anna 's turn to look blank . " Going to the Natchez Trace ? " she asked hopefully . " Nope , " Daddy said . " You 're going nowhere , " Baby added helpfully . " That 's pretty much it , " Daddy confirmed . " One of the rangers I talked to on the phone said this was a shortcut . " Daddy and Baby found that inordinately amusing . Gratitude was fading , but Anna had n't the energy to replace it with anything but pathos so she maintained her good cheer . At least outwardly . " What you want is Highway 27 out of Vicksburg , " Baby told her , and aimed a stream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're at starts out as Old Black Road and ends up as nothing down on the river . It 's where me and Daddy goes fishing . All 's down there is moccasins and mosquitoes . " " I must have read the directions wrong , " Anna said . " Way wrong . Those old boys was having a joke and you were it , " Daddy said succinctly . " You go on a couple miles'n you 'll see a place to turn around . Then you go back the way you come twenty miles or so . You 'll find 27 . If you hit the interstate , you gone too far . " Anna thanked them again . They waited . She waited . Then she realized they were n't leaving till they saw her safe in her car and on her way . Having loaded Taco , she climbed in the Rambler and pulled back into the twisted night . Daddy was right . She 'd not misread the directions ; she 'd followed them to the letter . One of her rangers was n't anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field ranger she 'd be supervising . Anna wished she could dredge up some surprise at the petty betrayal , but she was too old and too cynical . Nobody involved in the hiring process had come right out and said anything , and in these days of rampant litigation and gender skirmishes , they would n't dare . But she 'd heard the subtext in the pauses . There 'd never been a female law enforcement ranger on the far southern end of the Trace , and there 'd never been a female district ranger in any of the nine districts and four hundred fifty- Dodd miles of the parkway . It had been unofficially deemed too conservative , too old-fashioned for such an alarming development . From the gossip she 'd picked up , she was hired because she was known to have an " edge . " She was an experiment . They would find if she was to be a cat among the pigeons or the other way around . The " old-fashioned " people , Anna had thought , would be the park visitors . Randy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jump off that bridge when you come to it , she told herself . When she finally found her way onto the Trace , the sun was rising and , with it , her spirits . The vague picture she 'd formed in her mind of a bleak and dusty place , overfarmed by sharecroppers , dotted with shacks and broken-down vehicles , was shattered in a rainbow brilliance of flowers . " Wake up , Taco , " she said , nudging the beast with her knee . " Hang your head out the window or something useful . The place looks like it 's been decorated for a wedding . " The Natchez Trace Parkway , a two-lane road slated , when finished , to run from Nashville , Tennessee , to Natchez , Mississippi , had been the brainchild of the Ladies ' Garden Clubs in the south . Besides preserving a unique part of the nation 's past , the federal government had believed , building the Trace would pump money , jobs and a paved road into what was then a depressed area . Unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennessee or the John D. Rockefeller Jr . National Parkway in Wyoming , the Trace would not be based on spectacular scenery but would conserve the natural and agricultural history of Mississippi . It would follow and , where possible , preserve the original trail made through the swamps and forest by Kentucks , entrepreneurs out of what would become Kentucky , walking back home after rafting goods down the Mississippi to be sold at the port in Natchez , and by the outlaws who preyed upon them , by Indians trading and warring and finally by soldiers of the Union Army bent on bringing the South to heel . This morning no ghost of the violence remained . Mile after mile , the road dipped and turned gracefully through rich fields , grassy meadows , shoulders bright in red clover , daffodils , pink joe-pye weed and a water-blue flower Anna did n't recognize . Dogwood blossoms winked through the spring woods . Purple wisteria , vines covering trees fifty feet high , draped to the ground . Red bud trees added crimson patches . Carolina jasmine , yellow falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there was no traffic . Not a single car coming or going . The dreamlike quality of the frog-song-filled night was carrying over into the light of day . After twelve miles of garden beauty , the road widened briefly into four lanes and Anna saw the sign for Rocky Springs Campground . " We 're home , " she told the animals . The words sounded mocking , though she 'd not meant them that way . Mississippi was about as far from home as Anna had ever been , if not in miles , then in mind .
