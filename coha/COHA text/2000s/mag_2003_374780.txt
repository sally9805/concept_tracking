Vladimir Ilich Ulyanov , who used 160 pseudonyms , the most famous being Lenin , woke up at 10:30 a.m. on the day he was to die . About 18 months earlier , he had suffered a massive stroke and never fully recovered , so 10:30 was not so late for the old revolutionary to rise . He had some coffee , but it did not take , and he went back to bed . By evening Lenin was running a high fever , as Oxford historian Robert Service recounts in Lenin : A Biography . Lenin 's Bolshevik buddy Nikolai Bukharin was there at the end : " When I ran into Ilich 's room , full of doctors and stacked with medicines , Ilich let out a last sigh ... Ilich , Ilich was no more . " <P> The cause of death remains uncertain  --  some say it was syphilis ; others say an operation to remove a bullet from his neck damaged him . ( He had been shot in 1918 by a young anarchist who was herself promptly shot . ) One theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 53 , had simply worked himself to death ; he had driven himself hard , especially for a son of such a prosperous family . ( One of his grandfathers had been a landowner with personal control over 40 peasant families . ) <P> Lenin 's early death opened the way for the horrors of Stalin . Would Lenin have stopped them ? The latest scholarship reminds us that Leninism was a brutal philosophy . As historian Helene d'Encausse wrote in her 2001 biography , " On the threshold of death , Lenin had hardly changed " : he never backed away from the one-party , one-ideology , fiercely self-protecting state . When asked once why a group of political foes needed killing , Lenin had replied , " Do n't you understand that if we do not shoot these few leaders we may be placed in a position where we would need to shoot 10,000 workers ? " But Stalin would turn out to be a man with no qualms about murdering 10,000  --  or 10 million . Lenin had criticized Stalin , who had become General Secretary in 1922 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He had no idea just how much power Stalin would wield after that January eve .  --  By John Cloud
