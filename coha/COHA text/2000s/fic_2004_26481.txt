Love and the Single Heiress Chapter One Today 's Modern Woman should strive for personal enlightenment , independence , and forthrightness . The perfect place to begin this quest for assertiveness is in the bedchamber ... A Ladies ' Guide to the Pursuit of Personal Happiness and Intimate Fulfillment by Charles Brightmore " Scandalous , that 's what it is , " came an outraged male whisper . " My wife has somehow secured a copy of that deuced Ladies ' Guide . " " How do you know ? " came another gruff male whisper . " Damned obvious , what with the way she 's been acting . Been spewing out nonsense about ' today 's modern woman ' and ' independence ' like a steaming teakettle . Just yesterday she marched into my private study and proceeded to question me regarding my gambling markers and the amount of time I spend at White 's ! " Sharp intakes of breath followed . " Outrageous , " muttered the gruff whisperer . " Precisely what I told her . " " What did you do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my study , called for a carriage , and sent her to Asprey 's to pick out a new bauble to occupy her mind . " " Excellent . I assume your strategy worked ? " " Unfortunately not as well as I 'd hoped . Last night I found her awaiting me in my bedchamber . Gave me quite a turn , I tell you . Especially as I 'd just left my mistress and was thoroughly worn-out . Bloody hell , a wife 's not supposed to make such demands , or have such expectations . " " My wife did the same thing just last week , " came a third aggrieved whisper . " Entered my bedchamber , bold as you please , pushed me onto the mattress , then ... well , I can only describe it as to say she jumped upon me . Completely deflated my lungs and damn near crushed me . As I lie there , immobile with shock , fighting for my very breath , she says in a most impatient tone , ' Bump your arse a bit . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I thought I could n't be more astonished , she demanded to know why I 'd never ... " The voice lowered further and Lady Catherine Ashfield , Viscountess Bickley , leaned closer to the Oriental screen that secreted her presence from the gentlemen on the other side . " ... This Charles Brightmore must be stopped , " whispered one of the gentlemen . " I agree . A disaster of gargantuan proportions , that 's what he 's brought upon us . Why , if my daughter reads that cursed Guide , I 'll never marry off the foolish chit . Independence , indeed . Completely insupportable . This Guide could well prove even worse than the uproar incited by that Wollstonecraft woman 's writings . Nothing but ridiculous reformists ' balderdash . " Murmurs of agreement followed that pronouncement . Then the whisperer continued , " And as for the bedchamber , women are demanding enough creatures as it is , always wanting a new gown or earbobs or carriage or the like . ' T is outrageous that their expectations should extend to that . Especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother of two grown children . Unseemly , that 's what it is . " " Could n't agree more . Should I ever find myself in the company of this Brightmore bastard , I 'll personally wring his bloody neck . Tarring and feathering is too good for him . Everyone I 've spoken to feels certain that ' Charles Brightmore ' is a pseudonym , and coward that he is , he 's refused to step forward and identify himself . The betting book at White 's is a frenzy of wagers on the subject of his identity . Damn it all , what sort of man would think , let alone write , such unseemly ideas ? " " Well , I stopped at White 's just before coming here , and the latest theory proposes the possibility that Charles Brightmore is in fact a woman . Indeed , I heard ... " The gentleman 's low-pitched words were drowned out by a trill of nearby feminine laughter . Catherine inched closer , all but pressing her ear to the screen . " ... and if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century ... " She heard some more unintelligible mumbling , then , " ... hired an investigator two days ago to get to the bottom of this . He comes highly recommended ... ruthless , and will ferret out the truth . In fact  --  oh , bloody hell , my wife 's caught sight of me . Hang it , look at her , fluttering her eyelashes at me . Shocking , that 's what it is . Appalling . And altogether frightening . " Catherine peeked around the edge of the screen . Lady Markingworth stood at the edge of the dance floor , her rotund proportions ensconced in an unfortunate shade of yellowish green satin that cast her complexion with a distinctly jaundiced hue , her brown hair arranged in a complicated coiffure involving sausage curls , ribbons , and peacock feathers . With her attention fixed on the opposite side of the screen , Lady Markingworth was batting her eyes as one might if caught in a dust-ridden windstorm . Then , with an air of determination , she marched toward the screen . " Egad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonged to Lord Markingworth . " She 's got that damnable gleam in her eye . " " And it 's too late to escape , old man . " " Bloody hell . A plague on that bastard Charles Brightmore 's house . I 'm going to find out who this person is , then kill him  --  or her . Slowly . " " There you are , Ephraim , " said Lady Markingworth , her greeting followed by a girlish giggle . " I 've been searching for you everywhere . The waltz is about to start . And how fortunate that Lords Whitly and Carweather are with you . Your wives anxiously await you near the dance floor , my lords . " Throat clearing and several harrumphs followed this announcement , then the scuffle of shoes upon the parquet floor as the group moved away . Catherine leaned against the oak-paneled wall and drew a shaky breath , pressing her hands to her midsection . Slipping behind the screen in search of a moment of sanctuary from the hordes of party guests had taken a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the approaching Lords Avenbury and Ferrymouth , both of whom had dogged her footsteps since the moment she 'd arrived at her father 's birthday party and separately attempted to maneuver her into a tte -- tte ...
