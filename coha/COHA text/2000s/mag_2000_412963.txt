From man-eating cratures to creatures a man can eat , scientists discover a wild world under the seas . Stuart Stratton steers a remote-control sub deep into the frigid , inky-black waters of an undersea canyon . He 's on the prowl off the California coast to capture animals rarely seen by humans . The 6 to 12-inch creatures can swim very rapidly , using a set of fins that grow only when the animal reaches adulthood . To escape from predators , the vampire squid ejects a mucous that contains thousands of spheres of blue glowing light . When the light show ends , the animal has vanished into the dark water . Sneaking up on the squid , Mr. Stratton floats it gently into the sub 's collection container .

It takes lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 34year-old Stratton , who earned his Eagle Scout Award with Troop 449 , Vancouver , Wash . Alien Planet on Earth Mr. Stratton works for scientists at Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute at Moss Landing , Calif . Some of the creatures he captures go to the arby Monterey Bay Aquarium . Also probing " Inner Space " - what scientists call the vast , mostly unexplored oceans below 150 feet are scientists in Massachusetts , Florida , Maryland and around the world . Photograph Stuart Stratton ( right ) and others pilot research subs like the Ventana by remote control . // Some of their far-out projects are like exploring a bizarre alien planet The World of Giant Worms These scientists dive into an eerie world , often squeezing into one-person subs half the size of a car . They study erupting volcanoes and violent earthquakes on the sea floor . And they cozy up to strange marine animals that live near chimneys on the ocean bottom that shoot plumes so hot they 'd melt your skin . Way out in the Pacific Ocean , scientists have found deep-sea oases teeming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger than people eat , gruesomelooking eight-foot tube worms and eyeless white shrimp . Even close to shore , where the man-eating great white shark roams , scientists patrol the waters seeking new forms of life . Monterey Bay displays many odd critters-ever see a cat shark , rat fish or eelpout ? - gathered from depths to 13,000 feet . " Most of the 50 animals on display have never been seen before at any aquarium , " says exhibit supervisor and biologist Ed Seidel , a former Star Scout . Watch Out for That ... Chomp ! Another find from the sea : the tunicate , which sits motionless on a canyon wall with a translucent body and big , open mouth . When a prey swims too close , wham ! Its mouth clamps down for another meal . Other notable predators are the large , swift moving deep-sea sunstar , with up to 22 arms , and the California king crab . Sharp spikes on the crab 's body protect it from its enemies . Food From the Sea Scientists are n't just gathering these creatures for fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical and biotechnology products to improve our lives . Some marine organisms already play a role in America 's daily food supply . There 's a room called the Ocean Supermarket in the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego , Calm Along the walls are dozens of every day family food products containing ingredients that come from the sea . Photograph The spiny king crab roams for Live prey or dead scraps from others . // Among the surprising products : blueberry waffles , ice cream , chocolate milk , fruit-filled bars , instant oriental noodles , liquid baby formula , licorice candy , pudding mix , salad dressings , strawberry cheesecake and whipped cream . And those are tasty morsels that even a vampire squid could enjoy A REAL-LIFE SEA MONSTER 60-foot-long monster with eyes as big as hubcaps and eight 40-foot tentacles prowls the ocean 's depths . The beast uses those tentacles to grab prey . Suckers on its arms begin digging into the victim 's flesh , its powerful beak rips chunks of flesh from its helpless quarry . This 1,000-pound terminator-the giant squid-is the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The giant squid is a puzzle to scientists because no modern man has ever seen a healthy specimen in its natural habitat . " But we know they exist because giant squids have washed up on beaches around the world , " says marine researcher Stuart Stratton . In past centuries , tall tales were told of monster squids that sank ships at sea . A giant squid was the beast that attacked the submarine in Jules Verne 's 1873 novel , " Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea . " ( Check your local library for the book and for the November 1996 issue of Boys Life , which had a cartoon adaptation of this classic tale ) SURPRISES AWAIT IN THE WORLD 'S OCEANS Deep-sea exploration began with the vova of the British vessel HMS Challenger in 1872 . Nearly 130 years later , the ocean remains a mystery . Scientists estimate the deep ocean is home to as many as 10 million species . Most have never been seen by people . Some things about the oceans we do know : Depth : Average depth is 2.2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deepest point is Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench of the Pacific Ocean at 35.840 feet . You could hide Mount Everest , the world 's tallest mountain , in there . Darkness : Ocean waters are nearly pitch black below 450 feet . Temperature : Most of the deep sea averages about 39 degrees Fahrenheit . Undersea Mountains : A mountain range stretches 46,000 miles along the ocean floor from the Arctic , through the Atlantic Ocean , into the Indian Ocean and across the South Pacific . Its peaks tower 9,800 feet above the sea floor . // In 1972 , 100 years after the first national created , the United States government b Thes tected areas range in size from one-quart. mile in Fagatele Bay , American Samoa , to r 5,300 square miles in Monterey Bay , Calif . Sidebar HIGH-TECH SUBS EXPLORE THE OCEANS snazzy miniature submarine called Deep Worker 2000 is the newest craft to join the deep-sea exploration fleet . Carrying a solo pilot , the craft is so flexible it can move sideways like a crab , spin around or just hover . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a little sports car , " says pilot Dan Howard . " From its bucket seat in an acrylic dome , you can see in any direction because your head is higher than the rest of the sub . " Deep Worker 2000 was developed for Sustainable Seas Expeditions , a five-year program studying America 's 12 marine preserves ( see map ) . The program 's goals : exploration and discovery , scientific research , use of new technologies and public awareness of the ocean environment . Find out more at ERROR? // <p>
