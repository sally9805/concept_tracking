Meet fashion 's most enduring model  --  a woman with a past and a presence . CARMEN DELL'OREFICE is on the telephone with her booker at the Ford Model Agency . " Do n't send the car at seven-thirty if the shoot is n't until nine o'clock , " she is saying in her precise but girlish voice . " I 'll have done my own basic makeup at home , and I do n't want to sit a round getting tired and cranky while everything else is set up . Send the car at a quarter to nine . " She casts her enormous hazel eyes heavenward with pardoning amusement , as if to say , Oh , these kids ! She is , after all , an old hand at this game  --  one of the oldest in the business , though you would not immediately guess it to glance at her . She may not have graced as many magazine covers or enjoyed the same iconic status as Dovima , Suzy Parker or Lisa Fonssagrives , women whose looks defined fashion in their eras ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she claims ) . But whereas their careers lasted for years , hers has continued for a lifetime . No other model , past or present , has been as beautiful for as long as she has . Photograph : Carmen at seventy-six : Still beautiful and still working . When she began modeling , the term supermodel had n't yet been coined , but she 's more than proved herself a super model  --  after all , she 's been at it for sixty-three years . Photograph by Perry Hagopian . Hair by Patrick Melville for Warren-Tricomi Management , using Redken products . Makeup by gita Bass for Nars . Giorgio Armani blouse ( $495 ) , 212-988-9191 Born in 1931 , " Little Carmen , " as she was known , began her extraordinary modeling career at the age of thirteen , with a series of photographs by Clifford Coffin in the pages of Vogue . She worked with the greatest masters of the golden age of fashion photography  --  Cecil Beaton , Horst , Irving Penn , Erwin Blumenfeld , Francesco Scavullo , Lillian Bassman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newton , Frances McLaughlin-Gill . She has modeled gowns for Mainbocher , hats for Mr. John and evening dresses for John Galliano and Princess Diana 's favorite designers , the Emanuels . She was a classically cool Breck Girl in the 1950s , posed topless ( while demurely hiding her face ) in the Vanity Fair Lingerie ads and appeared as the unforgettably named Baby May Zoftig in The Last of the Secret Agents ? , Norman Abbott 's otherwise forgettable 1966 film . And today , at seventy-six , more than sixty years after she first posed for Coffin 's camera , Carmen is still so busy that Patty Sicular , vice president of the Ford agency , says , " Keeping track of Carmen 's bookings is a full-time job . " The shoot tomorrow is one of five engagements on her calendar over the next few weeks , and , says Sicular , " she has two clients fighting over her , one in Vienna and one in Mexico City .

It 's not really surprising . At five feet nine inches tall , with the rangy silhouette of a Thoroughbred racehorse and a mane of thick silver hair , Carmen ( she uses only her first name professionally ) still has the sort of beauty that turns heads at Le Cirque or on the subway . " Was Garbo beautiful at twenty and at sixty ? " asks Lillian Bassman , who shot Carmen for Harper 's Bazaar in the 1950s and has remained a friend to this day . " Of course . And it 's the same with Carmen . " Alfred Allan Lewis , who cowrote her 1985 book , Staying Beautiful , likened her to Dietrich , and Horst compared her to a painting by Botticelli . But it 's more than beauty that has ensured Carmen 's professional longevity . As another legendary lensman , Victor Skrebneski , says : " She 's a professional , and she knows what to do when you photograph her . She 's kind , she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a wonderful personality . " Carmen herself puts it down to " genes , good luck , timing and stamina . " Then she adds , deadpan , " A sense of humor is a necessity . " Photograph : " I wanted it to be triumphant , " says Carmen , speaking of her first shoot with Richard Avedon , done to showcase the 1957 couture collection for Harper 's Bazaar . " I wanted to prove that Dick could use me as effectively as he had my predecessors like Dovima and Dorian Leigh . " As shown in this image , the grace and con &shy; fidence that Carmen had developed through ballet and swimming were apparent  --  although " actually , I think the low heels make my feet look unattrac &shy; tive in this position , " she says . " But it was Dick 's idea , so I jumped for him . " Richard Avedon/Courtesy the Richard Avedon Foundation/c 2007 The Richard Avedon Foundation It must certainly have helped in her early days , which , starting with her birth on Welfare Island ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sound like something Dickens might have dreamed up if he 'd been writing about New York during the Depression instead of Victorian London . Unable to find paying gigs in the pit orchestras of Broadway , Carmen 's violinist father decamped for the touring circuit and eventually disappeared altogether , leaving his daughter to search for father figures elsewhere , and his wife , a former dancer , to scrape by on earnings from housekeeping or waitressing jobs that often could not cover the cost of both feeding and housing their child . Carmen 's childhood was a mosaic of foster families and **29;1654;TOOLONG moves from one gritty part of New York to another . " By the time I was twelve years old , I had gone to thirteen public schools , " she says . " I was a displaced person . " Even when Carmen was living with her mother , as she mostly did , she encountered a sometimes bewilderingly difficult parent . " My mother told me I had ears like sedan doors and feet like coffins , " Carmen recalls matter-of-factly . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from biting my fingernails . " She 's candid about relating such details and not about to indulge in any hand-wringing . " That 's not abuse , " she corrects when asked . " These are events that teach . I enjoyed what most people would call a struggle or adversity . I did n't experience it as hard knocks ; I experienced it as life , my life .

That life changed overnight , but only after Carmen 's first modeling foray ended in disappointment . She was taking the 57th Street crosstown bus home from swimming practice when the wife of a Harper 's Bazaar photographer noticed her and asked if she would pose for her husband . Once submitted , however , the resulting photos were not only rejected , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her daughter was , in fact , unphotogenic . The turndown soon had its upside : it was so dispiriting that it led a family friend to arrange for Carmen to interview at Vogue . A second photo shoot  --  the one with Clifford Coffin  --  quickly followed , and not long after , a Vogue contract , paying the then impressive sum of $7.50 an hour . Within a short time everyone was clamoring to work with the scrawny child with the enormous eyes and the air of preternatural gravity ( a mouthful of braces meant she never smiled in photographs ) . Beaton ( " the first man ever to make me feel beautiful " ) lit her like a girl in a Vermeer painting and shot her in profile , reading a letter and wearing a ribbon-embroidered evening dress ; Blumenfeld draped her in backless silk and fought to put the result  --  daringly naked at the time for a sixteen-year-old girl  --  on Vogue 's cover ; the British court photographer Norman Parkinson posed her dreaming on a Plaza hotel balcony and clad in strapless gray taffeta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " I had such a crush on him , " says Carmen ) cast her to type as Cinderella , Snow White and Little Red Riding Hood in a 1946 fairy-tale photo essay featuring famous figures like Jose Ferrer , Dorothy Parker and Babe Paley playing , respectively , the Wolf , a Wicked Stepsister and the Fairy Godmother . With these photographers , and others , Carmen discovered a new kind of relationship , what she describes as " a great , intriguing romance with an indefinable figure behind the camera , but the lover is the lens . " She goes on : " It 's a dialogue that happens kinetically . I look at the photographer because he 's always telling me what he wants by the slightest flicker of his eyelid , a hand movement or a shoulder movement  --  it 's like a love affair , a wonderful love affair that does n't hurt anybody . The product is not a child but a photograph . " Photograph : As envisioned for Vogue by Horst , 1946 . " She has ... the physical attributes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wrote . If Carmen 's professional life seemed like a fairy tale , sometimes her personal one did as well  --  though whether it was " Cinderella " or " Little Red Riding Hood " is hard to say . Concerned by her extreme thinness and pallor when shooting his storybook series , Penn insisted she get medical treatment , and after a regimen of iron and B vitamins for anemia and hormone shots for her delayed menarche , Carmen blossomed into a willowy nymph . " I was seventeen and looked thirty-five , " she says . " I imagined that I was grown-up and someone would give me a Charles James dress and I would go to the ball . And I did ultimately go to the ball  --  in something I made myself . " The legendary designer did , in fact , lend the **39;1685;TOOLONG some of his creations for special occasions . And she suddenly found she was attracting the attention of a number of caf society 's boldfaced names : Pat DeCicco , the Long Island playboy and Gloria Vanderbilt 's first husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columnist Igor Cassini ( Cholly Knickerbocker ) ; and even the very married Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy , who proposed that Carmen and her mother move into his Park Avenue residence . ( Mama Dell'Orefice drew the line there , saying , " If only he wanted to introduce you to one of his sons , that would have been a different story . " ) Photograph : At San Simeon for Town &; Country in 1980 , photographed by Norman Parkinson . Somehow Carmen survived her brush with these men of the world and , at twenty-one , after a four-year romance , married William Miles , an entrepreneur ten years older than she , with whom she had a daughter , Laura , now a psychologist living in California . The marriage did n't last ; neither did her second , to a photographer , Richard Heimann ; nor her third , to an architect , Richard Kaplan , who urged her to consider a breast-lift and once pulled a gray hair out of her head when she thought he was going to kiss her . What did last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the modeling business . Photograph : A cover by Gleb Derujinsky from 1959  --  " probably the most artistic of anything ever done of me . " Although she 'd found herself briefly out of favor in the late forties , when she 'd lost her childish figure , and she had taken a brief furlough after her daughter was born , Carmen had worked nearly nonstop until her third marriage , in 1963 . At that time , with most of her contemporaries already retired , she 'd felt it was time to quit : " Twenty years of being on or near the top was a very good run . " Ten years later , alone , deeply depressed in the wake of a divorce from a husband who thought she was too old for him , and left nearly penniless by the process , she realized , " There was only one thing I was qualified for , one thing I had experience at , one thing I loved doing . " But she was forty-seven and had been out of circulation for a decade . Unsurprisingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her prospects , but a few of the photographers Carmen had worked with eventually came to her rescue : Carmine Schiavone , Hiro and , especially , Parkinson , who at the height of fashion 's youth craze used the nearly fifty-year-old Carmen to model the Paris collections for French Vogue and then persuaded Town &; Country to feature her in a photo essay on William Randolph Hearst 's San Simeon  --  the first of several projects the duo undertook for this magazine . The urbane Parkinson understood instinctively how to draw out not only Carmen 's glamour but also her wit and eccentricity ; in one shoot he daringly posed her swinging above London on a building crane . He and Carmen , who considers him " one of the two geniuses I 've seen up close " ( the other is Avedon ) , luxuriated in their rapport , and under his guidance her career achieved a second liftoff : soon she was parading the runways for John Galliano at Dior and being featured in ad campaigns for Banana Republic and Saks Fifth Avenue . Now , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my carcass . This world better get used to seeing me as a model ; I 'm having fun . " Photograph : This 1957 image , also from Avedon 's Bazaar shoot , captures Carmen 's talent for creating a relationship with the camera . " It 's like a love affair , a wonderful love affair that does n't hurt anybody , " she says . " The product is not a child but a photograph . " Richard Avedon/courtesy the Richard avedon foundation/c 2007 The richard avedon foundation She certainly seems to be . " She weighs practically what she weighed when she was sixteen , " notes Ford approvingly . And although Carmen freely admits to having had surgical dermabrasion and silicone injections " all over , " as well as plastic surgery to correct a broken nose , her fashion-and-beauty regimen is both back-to-basics and down-to-earth . That means no smoking ; no dieting ( " I eat like a truck driver , " she confesses ) ; no hair dyeing ( gray hair , she says , is " nature 's way of softening your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( swimming and stretching ) ; occasional acupressure ; bare-bones cosmetics ( M.A.C foundation is a favorite ) ; and a wardrobe of standards from Banana Republic and Bolton 's ( " I want clothing to be disposable " ) , sparked by clothes she runs off herself on one of her four sewing machines and by occasional star pieces like a Gilles Montezin coat she recently wore in a fashion shoot . She delights in the new acquaintances she makes on assignment and cherishes her old friendships ( " they 're everything to me " ) . She revels in the freedom that experience and maturity bring to romance . " What 's wonderful about age , " she exults , " is that I do n't need to compromise for the sake of having a relationship . " Photograph : " This was my first Vogue cover , in 1947 , by Erwin Blumenfeld . I had braces , so for four years I never smiled in a picture . " Erwin Blumenfeld/c Cond Nast Archive/Corbis Still , certain things cause her dismay . She 's skeptical about some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , have gone in since she began working : the emphasis on highly sexualized photographs of ever-younger models ( " it 's disgusting  --  these pictures just say , " Come and get me ' ' " ) ; the lack of realism and refinement in dressing ( " we 're inundated with pizzazz ; you do n't see clothing or the person , you see costumes " ) ; the rise of digital photography ( " now someone can shoot 500 pictures on a card , and one of them turns out , and suddenly he 's a photographer " ) . Sometimes she finds herself enervated by " the monotony of the sameness of all these images , " and she 's understandably testy about " clients who do n't pay .

Alfred Allan Lewis describes a recent shoot she had with a photographer du jour who had never worked with her before and was baffled that she did n't strike poses in the way the current " It " girls do .
