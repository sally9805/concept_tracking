Every afternoon , Timothy Malt walked home from school along the same route . Every afternoon , when he got home , he let himself into the house with his own door key . He fetched a carton of orange juice from the fridge , and poured himself a glass . He grabbed three biscuits from the tin , hurried into the sitting room and sat down on the big , squashy sofa . Then he played computer games until his mum came home from her office or his dad came home from his office . That day , things were different . Tim found a dog . Actually , the dog found Tim . During the long afternoons at school , Tim always ignored the teacher 's droning voice and dreamed about his computer . After school , he sped home , not wanting to waste any time walking when he could be playing a game . That day , Tim was hurrying home from school even faster than usual , because he had recently used two months ' pocket money to buy a new game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helicopter simulators for his computer , but this was much more realistic than any of the others . According to the box , pilots used it to practice before flying a new helicopter . In the past few days , Tim had managed to master most of the basic maneuvers . He could take off . He could fly across fields . He could slalom round tower blocks . Now , he needed to practice flying through the jungle , avoiding the tallest trees , before venturing on hisfirst combat mission . As Tim hurried along the street towards home , he tried to imagine the best way to fly through the jungle . He waved his hands from right to left as if he was using the control sticks . He imagined all the obstacles that he might encounter . Trees as tall as buildings . Creepers hanging from the branches . Boa constrictors sneaking up the trunks . Parrots flying through the air . Monkeys leaping from tree to tree . He was concentrating so hard on imagining all the jungle 's obstacles that he did n't bother looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of something on the pavement . The lump yelped . Tim fell down . As he fell , Tim stretched out his arms to protect himself . So , his head did n't hit the concrete , but his elbows did . First the right . Then the left . Crunch ! Crack ! The pain as unbelievable . " Owww , " he groaned . He rolled over , clutching his elbows and moaning softly to himself . " Oh , oh , oh . Ohhhh . " After a few seconds of agony , Tim felt something soft touching his cheek . Something soft and wet . He forgot the pain throbbing through his elbows , and opened his eyes . A pair of little black eyes stared at him . A tiny pink tongue licked his face . Tim rolled over , and sat up . The dog wagged its tail . It was a small dog with beady black eyes . It had white fur with black patches and a perky little tail , which was wagging like a metronome . Tim wanted to stroke the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't . His parents would be furious . His mother loathed dogs . ( She was allergic to them . ) His father detested dogs . ( They made such a lot of noise ! ) Tim 's mother and father had told him never to touch dogs- unless he wanted to catch rabies , fleas and tapeworm . Tim did n't want a tapeworm slithering through his guts , or fleas crawling under his clothes , or a deadly dose of rabies in his blood . So , he got up , tore his eyes away from the dog and continued walking along the street . As he walked , he rubbed his elbow . It still hurt . When Tim got to the end of the street , he realized that something was following him . He turned around . There was the dog . Tim said , " Go away . Go back home . " The dog wagged its tail . Tim said , " Why are you following me ? Can you stop following me , please ! " The dog put its head on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingernail . He always did that when he was thinking . Then , he took a deep breath , and bellowed , " GO AWAY ! " The dog put its head on the other side , and continued staring at him . Tim shrugged his shoulders . " Okay . Do what you like . " He kept walking along the street . Every few paces , he turned around , and saw that the dog was following him . After ten minutes , Tim reached his house . He put the key in the lock , then looked down at the dog . " Why are you still here ? " The dog lay down with its head resting on its paws , andlooked up at Tim . Tim looked into the dog 's little black eyes , and saw an expression that he recognized . Not sadness . Not loneliness . Not fear . In the dog 's little black eyes , Tim saw hunger . Come to think of it , thought Tim , I 'm hungry too . Tim tried to imagine what would happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head . It was n't worth thinking about . His mother would be so angry that she would stamp her feet and wave her arms above her head . His father would be so angry that he would n't say a single word , but his face would go bright red and his eyes would look as if they were going to pop out of his head . Tim 's mother and father were good at being angry . Over the years , they had had a lot of practice . Tim looked down at the little dog , and said , " Sorry . I ca n't let you into the house . But I 'll go inside , and get some bread . Okay ? If you stay here , I 'll bring some bread . Do you understand ? " From the Hardcover edition .
