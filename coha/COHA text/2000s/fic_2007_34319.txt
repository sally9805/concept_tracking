Chapter One She sometimes wondered what her life might have been like had she been given only one first name . Instead , she had two-Nellie , after her great-grandmother on her father 's side , and Mae , for Mamma 's youngest sister . Despite the near-fancy ring to them , Mamma had often said the names were a good fit , and what with the special attention Nellie Mae gave to creating her pies , cakes , and other pastries , she guessed her mother was right . But I 'm not fancy , not one bit ! She hurried across the drive toward the bakery shop set back behind the house , where Dat had made an area for parking both automobiles and horses and buggies . Nellie Mae glanced at the hand-painted sign atop the bakery shop and smiled . Nellie 's Simple Sweets . The cozy place was considered hers because of her near-constant baking as a girl . By the time she could roll out pie dough or see to it that a two-layer cake did not fall , she was baking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dat who had suggested building a small shop right on the premises to offer Nellie 's delectable treats to the rest of Honeybrook . Of course , it never hurt to bring in some extra cash , which the shop certainly did , thanks to word of mouth from Nellie 's many satisfied customers . This nippy September morning , Nellie Mae raised the green shades on each window and quickly turned the sign on the door to Open . In less than five minutes , the regulars started to arrive , all Englischers , two by car , and the other on foot . The brass bell on the door jingled merrily as they each entered , all smiles . " Willkumm , " Nellie greeted first Mrs. Hensley , a woman with a distinct southern accent ; then Miss Bachman , who was known for her peanut butter cravings ; and Rhoda 's employer , Mrs. Kraybill , two of her children in tow . Not wanting to appear overly eager , Nellie Mae stood primly behind the counter while the ladies perused the display case . Mrs. Hensley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress resembling a sack beneath her sweater . Rhoda had spoken of such tent dresses , as they were called by the English , and Nellie was polite not to stare at what surely was the brightest dress she 'd ever seen . With her swept-over bangs and pouffy hair , Mrs. Hensley could n't have looked more like an Englischer . Mrs. Kraybill blinked her pretty eyes over her rimless glasses and asked , " Would you mind if I purchased all four dozen of the pumpkin cookies ? " " Why no , not at all , " Nellie was quick to say . Mrs. Hensley pointed to the cinnamon-raisin cake front and center on the counter , tapping her manicured fingernails on the glass . It was nearly all Nellie could do to keep from leaning forward and telling her how wonderful- gut the cake tasted . " How do you bake all this yourself ? " Mrs. Hensley asked , her fingernails still resting on the glass . " It 's perfectly lovely . " " Melts in your mouth , too , " added Miss Bachman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How you manage to bake everything without so much as a recipe amazes me , Miss Nellie Mae . You 're a walking cookbook ! " Glancing at Mrs. Hensley , she smiled . " If you want the recipe , just ask . Nellie 's as generous with her know-how as she is with the sugar on her cookies . " Nellie Mae blushed . She had always had a good memory . When it came to listing off ingredients and correct measurements , she could do so in her sleep . Rooting in her purse , Mrs. Hensley pulled out her wallet and a small tablet . " Would you mind terribly , dear ? I 'd love to try my hand at that cake . " Her eyes pleaded for the recipe . Quickly Nellie rattled off the ingredients and the measurements , feeling somewhat self-conscious , even though she did n't mind one iota sharing such things with her regular customers . If only Caleb Yoder would stop by sometime , she thought before catching herself . It was wrong to boast , and she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sake of male admiration . Still , Nellie could hope . She turned her attention to making correct change . When she 'd finished with Mrs. Hensley 's purchases , she assisted the other two women , who , much to Nellie Mae 's delight , were now fussing over who would have the fudge . * * * Nellie Mae sat fidgeting in her elder brother Ephram 's carriage early Thursday morning , thankful Mamma had sent Nan to oversee the bakery shop so she could make this visit . She adjusted her black outer bonnet while Ephram sat silently on the right-hand side of the carriage , his eyes focused on the road as they drove toward his house . Snug under her heavy woolen lap robe , she tucked her hands into the gray muff and shivered , wishing it were summer again . She daydreamed of lying in a green meadow , the delicious scent of wildflowers perfuming the air . Will Caleb ask me home from Singing by next summer , at least ? So much time had passed already . Regardless , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care for , even though she had been guilty of stringing two young men along . While she 'd enjoyed their company , most of the boys she 'd gone with were ho-hum ; none of them made her heart sing the way Caleb had the day he 'd smiled at her . As with every boy around here , all had plans to farm . That was right fine with Nellie Mae . She was n't hoping for someone who would do things differently . All she wanted was someone who had opinions of his own , and was not only appealing but who was smitten with her , as well . Is that too much to ask ? Lots of girls married simply to get hitched , and she had no interest in that . She would not marry if it meant settling for someone to cook and clean for and having a whole string of babies . She wanted what Mamma had with Dat-a steady fire between them . Even after all these years , she could see it when her parents looked at each other from across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buggy was warmer today than yesterday , when she 'd gone with her mother to the general store in Honeybrook after closing her shop for the day . She always felt more secure when either her father or one of her five older brothers drove the team . Of course their driving was not nearly as much fun as the wild buggy driving the fellows she 'd dated liked to do . No doubt such recklessness was partly to blame for several fatal accidents involving buggies and cars in recent years , not all on the more congested main roads . Surely it was good that today her elder brother-responsible husband and father of four , with another on the way-steadily held the reins , just as he did for his family . Who will hold the reins of my life ? She shifted her feet , conscious of the tremor of the wheels on the road through the high-topped black shoes her mother had insisted she wear . " Too late in the season for bare feet , " Mamma had said before sending her off . " Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nellie sighed , watching the trees as the horse and buggy carried her along . She dreaded the coming winter with its lash of ice and wind . She wriggled her toes in the confining shoes , longing for the freedom of bare feet . Farmers up and down the long road-Amish and English alike-were busy baling hay ... what little there was , due to the regional drought . Farther up the road , the neighbors ' apple orchard came into view . Immediately she wondered if the orchard had been affected , too . Would there be enough fruit for cider-making frolics and apple butter , come late fall ? The apple harvest always meant a large gathering of young people-perhaps Caleb would be among them . A work frolic was one of the ways the young people mingled during the daytime , but it was under the covering of night that courting took place . She tried to shut out the surroundings and let her mind wander , imagining what it would be like to encounter Caleb at such a lively get-together . She found herself lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hoping , too , he might not be as curious about Suzy 's death as certain others seemed to be . Her brother spoke just then , startling her . " You 're awful quiet , Nellie Mae . " Ephram did not gawk at her the way he sometimes did when they traveled to and from his house . Though the visits were rather infrequent , he had been kind enough to offer to bring her back with him this morning , sparing her the two-mile walk to visit her sister-in-law Maryann . If time permitted , Nellie wanted to see her best friend , Rosanna King , too . Her brother 's blond hair stuck out beneath his black felt hat . The straw hats of summer had recently disappeared on the menfolk , something that nearly always caught Nellie Mae by surprise every autumn . " You 're brooding , " he said . " Maybe so . " Absently she rubbed her forehead , wondering if her frowning into the morning light had given her away . " Aw , Nellie , what 's troubling you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been brooding ; she was simply pondering things . She glimpsed at him , averting her eyes before daring to ask , " Did ya hear anything ' bout that meeting Dat went to two weeks ago ? " Ephram turned right quick to look at her . She smiled . " Seems you did hear , then . " His rounded jaw fell and he turned his attention back to the road . Even though she rarely interacted with him , Nellie could see right through this brother . His dairy cattle and growing family kept him plenty well occupied these days , but Ephram had always worn his feelings on his plump face . " What 're you talkin ' about ? " he asked . " I heard there was a gathering . All hushed up , too . " He shook his head . Whether it was in disgust or out of reserve , she did n't know . Fact was , she wanted to know , but she would n't press him further . Not fitting for a woman , Mamma would say-though Nellie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even so , today there was no sense dredging up the tittle-tattle she 'd heard at the bakery shop about the menfolk and their secret meeting . Likely they 'd meant it to remain just that . Nellie wondered if this summer 's stunted crops had n't caused some of the recent turmoil . She 'd heard there were some who were convinced the failed crops were a dreadful prophecy to the area of Honeybrook . Limited as the problem was to their area , it was as if God had issued them a warning . She recalled the upheaval the phenomenon had caused . As farmers , their very livelihood depended upon the success of their crops . Feed for livestock and chickens had been trucked in . And the bakery shop felt the pinch , as well , from the need to purchase ingredients , tapping into the family 's profits . Shifting her weight a bit , she stared out the other window . The heavy dew looked much like frost , with the biting cold to go with it ; the harsh air must have sneaked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night . Summer 's end though it was , it felt like the middle of winter . And even though that meant ice and snow and wind and cold , Nellie Mae longed for this year to be over and a brand spanking new one to begin . Looking at her brother now , she wished he would say what he surely knew about the meeting in the bishop 's barn . What 's the big secret ? Ephram was turning in where the tree-lined lane led to his house . Right away Nellie spied Maryann standing in the door , clearly in the family way as she waved a hankie-welcome . " Now , do n't be fillin ' her head with your s'posings and all , " Ephram warned , stepping down to tie the horse to the hitching post . Nellie wondered why he hardly ever referred to his wife by her name . So many of their men referred to their wives as " she " or " her , " instead of by their lovely names . I sure would n't want to marry a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wondering what he would say to all the gossip . Should he ever be available to talk to , would she dare ask ? Or would he treat her the same distant way Ephram seemingly treated Maryann ?
