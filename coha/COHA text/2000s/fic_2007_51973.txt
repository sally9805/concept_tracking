Eight years have passed since the last time we brought you one of Mr. Silveiberg 's stories . And as it happens , an even fifty years have passed since we first brought you a Robert Silverbeig story . ( That story , " Warm Man , " was by no means his first sale . The bibliography on our Website says it was his 175th . ) These brief ruminations on Mr. Silveiberg 's long caieer aie entirely appiopiiate for this new tale , as it is one that takes us back . It is also one that ieminds us oh so well of why Robeit Silveibeig has enjoyed such a long and successful caieei as a storyteller . Hop in and enjoy the ride ! ABOUT HALF PAST FOUR in the afternoon Rackman felt a sudden red blaze of pain in both his temples at once , the sort of stabbing jab that you would expect to feel if a narrow metal spike had been driven through your head . It was gone as quickly as it had come , but it left him feeling queasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things were slow at the dealership just then anyway , he decided it might be best to call it a day and head for home . He stepped out into perfect summer weather , a sunny , cloudless day , and headed across the lot to look for Gene , his manager , who had been over by the SUVs making a tally of the leftovers . But Gene was nowhere in sight . The only person Rackman saw out there was a pudgy salesman named Freitas , who so far as he recalled had given notice a couple of weeks ago . Evidently he was n't gone yet , though . " I 'm not feeling so good and I 'm going home early , " Rackman announced . " If Gene 's around here somewhere , will you tell him that ? " " Sure thing , Mr. Rackman . " Rackman circled around the edge of the lot toward the staff parking area . He still felt queasy , and somewhat muddled too , with a slight headache lingering after that sudden weird stab of pain . Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance - there were more of the things than there should be , considering that he had just run a big clearance on them . They were lined up like a whopping great phalanx of tanks . How come so many ? He filed away a mental note to ask Gene about that tomorrow . He turned the ignition key and the sleek silver Prius glided smoothly , silently , out of the lot , off to the nearby freeway entrance . By the time he reached the Caldecott Tunnel twenty minutes later the last traces of the pain in his temple were gone , and he moved on easily through Oakland toward the bridge and San Francisco across the bay . At the Bay Bridge toll plaza they had taken down all the overhead signs that denoted the FasTrak lanes . That was odd , he thought . Probably one of their mysterious maintenance routines . Rackman headed into his usual lane anyway , but there was a tolltaker in the booth - why ? - and as he started to roll past the man toward the FasTrak scanner just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he braked to a halt . The FasTrak toll scanner was n't where it should be , right back of the tollbooth on the left . It was n't there at all . Feeling a little bewildered now , Rackman pulled a five-dollar bill from his wallet , handed it to the man , got what seemed to be too many singles in change , and drove out onto the bridge . There was very little traffic . As he approached the Treasure Island Tunnel , though , it struck him that he could n't remember having seen any of the towering construction cranes that ran alongside the torso of the not-quite-finished new bridge just north of the old one . Nor was there any sign of them - or any trace of the new bridge itself , for that matter , when he glanced into his rearview mirror . This is peculiar , Rackman thought . Really , really peculiar . On the far side of the tunnel the sky was darker , as though dusk were already descending - at five-ten on a summer day ? - and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridge the light was all but gone . Even stranger , a little rain was starting to come down . Rain falls in the Bay Area in August about once every twenty years . The morning forecast had n't said anything about rain . Rackman 's hand trembled a little as he turned his wipers on . I am having what could be called a waking dream , Rackman thought , some very vivid hallucination , and when I 'm off the bridge I better pull over to the curb and take a few deep breaths . The skyline of the city just ahead of him looked somehow diminished , as though a number of the bigger buildings were missing . And the exit ramps presented more puzzles . A lot of stuff that had been torn down for the retrofitting of the old bridge seemed to have been put back in place . He could n't find his Folsom Street off-ramp , but the long-gone Main Street one , which they had closed after the 1989 earthquake , lay right in front of him . He took it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at street level . The rain had stopped - the streets were dry , as if the rain had never been - but the air seemed clinging and clammy , not like dry summer air at all . It enfolded him , contained him in a strange tight grip . His cheeks were flushed and he was perspiring heavily . Deep breaths , yes . Calm . Calm . You 're only five blocks from your condo . Only he was n't . Most of the highrise office buildings were missing , all right , and none of the residential towers south of the offramp complex were there , just block after block of parking lots and some ramshackle warehouses . It was night now , and the empty neighborhood was almost completely dark . Everything was the way it had looked around here fifteen , twenty years before . His bewilderment was beginning to turn into terror . The street signs said that he was at his own corner . So where was the thirty-story building where he lived ? Better call Jenny , he thought . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something very baffling , a feeling of , well , disorientation , that in fact he was pretty seriously mixed up , that she had better come get him and take him home . But his cell phone did n't seem to be working . All he got was a dull buzzing sound . He looked at it , stunned . He felt as though some part of him had been amputated . Rackman was angry now as well as frightened . Things like this were n't supposed to happen to him . He was fifty-seven years old , healthy , solvent , a solid citizen , owner of a thriving Toyota dealership across the bay , married to a lovely and loving woman . Everyone said he looked ten years younger than he really was . He worked out three times a week and ran in the Bay-to-Breakers Race every year and once in a while he even did a marathon . But the drive across the bridge had been all wrong and he did n't know where his condo building had gone and his cell phone was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forlorn neighborhood of empty lots and abandoned warehouses with a wintry wind blowing - hey , had n't it been sticky and humid a few minute ago ? - on what had started out as a summer day . And he had the feeling that things were going to get worse before they got better . If indeed they got better at all . HE SWUNG AROUND and drove toward Union Square . Traffic was surprisingly light for downtown San Francisco . He spotted a phone booth , parked nearby , fumbled a coin into the slot , and dialed his number . The phone made ugly noises and a robot voice told him that the number he had dialed was not a working number . Cursing , Rackman tried again , tapping the numbers in with utmost care . " We 're sorry , " the voice said again , " the number you have reached is not - " A telephone book dangled before him . He riffled through it - Jenny had her own listing , under Burke - but though half a dozen J Burkes were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of town , and when he dialed the sixth number , which had no address listed , an answering machine responded in a birdlike chirping voice that certainly was n't Jenny 's . Something led him then to look for his own listing . No , that was n't there either . A curious calmness came over him at that discovery . There were no FasTrak lanes at the toll plaza , and the dismantled freeway ramps were still here , and the neighborhood where he lived had n't been developed yet , and neither he nor Jenny was listed in the San Francisco phone book , and therefore either he had gone seriously crazy or else somehow this had to be fifteen or even twenty years ago , which was pretty much just another way of saying the same thing . If this really is fifteen or twenty years ago , Rackman thought , then Jenny would be living in Sacramento and I 'd be across the bay in El Cerrito and still married to Helene . But what the hell kind of thing was that to be thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He considered taking himself to the nearest emergency room and telling them he was having a breakdown , but he knew that once he put himself in the hands of the medics , there 'd be no extricating himself : they 'd subject him to a million tests , reports would be filed with this agency and that , his driver 's license might be yanked , bad things would happen to his credit rating . It would be much smarter , he thought , to check himself into a hotel room , take a shower , rest , , try to figure all this out , wait for things to get back to normal . Rackman headed for the Hilton , a couple of blocks away . Though night had fallen just a little while ago , the sun was high overhead now , and the weather had changed again , too : it was sharp and cool , autumn just shading into winter . He was getting a different season and a different time of day every fifteen minutes or so , it seemed . The Hilton desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a self-important manner that as Rackman requested a room he felt a little abashed at not having any luggage with him , but the clerk did n't appear to give a damn about that , simply handed him the registration form and asked him for his credit card . Rackman put his Visa down on the counter and began to fill out the form . " Sir ? " the desk clerk said , after a moment . Rackman looked up . The clerk was staring at his credit card . It was the translucent kind , and he tipped it this way and that , puzzledly holding it against the light . " Problem ? " Rackman asked , and the clerk muttered something about how unusual the card looked . Then his expression darkened . " Wait just a second , " he said , very coldly now , and tapped the imprinted expiration date on the card . " What is this supposed to be ? Expires July , 2010 ? 2020 , sir ? 20101 Are we having a little joke , sir ? " He flipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have done if it had been covered with some noxious substance . Another surge of terror hit him . He backed away , moving quickly through the lobby and into the street . Of course he might have tried to pay cash , he supposed , but the room would surely be something like $225 a night , and he had only about $350 on him . If his credit card was useless , he 'd need to hang on to his cash at least until he understood what was happening to him . Instead of the Hilton , he would go to some cheaper place , perhaps one of the motels up on Lombard Street . On his way back to his car Rackman glanced at a newspaper in a sidewalk rack . President Reagan was on the front page , under a headline about the invasion of Grenada . The date on the paper was Wednesday , October 26 , 1 983 . Sure , he thought . 1 983 . This hallucination is n't missing a trick . I am in 1983 and Reagan is President again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1957 , 1950 - In 1950 Rackman had n't even been born yet . He wondered what was going to happen to him when he got back to a time earlier than his own birth . He stopped at the first motel on Lombard that had a vacancy sign and registered for a room . The price was only $75 , but when he put two fifties down on the counter , the clerk , a pleasant , smiling Latino woman , gave him a pleasant smile and tapped her finger against the swirls of pink coloration next to President Grant 's portrait . " Somebody has stuck you with some very funny bills , sir . But you know that I ca n't take them . If you can pay by credit card , though , Visa , American Express - " Of course she could n't take them . Rackman remembered , now , that all the paper money had changed five or ten years back , new designs , bigger portraits , distinctive patches of pink or blue ink on their front sides that had once been boringly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date " 2004 " in the corner . So far as the world of 1983 was concerned , the money he was carrying was nothing but play money . 1983 . Jenny , who is up in Sacramento in 1983 and has no idea yet that he even exists , had been twenty-five that year . Already he was more than twice her age . And she would get younger and younger as he went ever onward , if that was what was going to continue to happen . Maybe it would n't . Soon , perhaps , the pendulum would begin to swing the other way , carrying him back to his own time , to his own life . What if it did n't , though ? What if it just kept on going ? In that case , Rackman thought , Jenny was lost to him , with everything that had bound them together now unhappened . Rackman reached out suddenly , grasping the air as though reaching for Jenny , but all he grasped was air . There was no Jenny for him any longer . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything else of what he had thought of as his fife as well , his whole past peeling away strip by strip . He had no reason to think that the pendulum would swing back . Already the exact details of Jenny 's features were blurring in his mind . He struggled to recall them : the quizzical blue eyes , the slender nose , the wide , generous mouth , the slim , supple body . She seemed to be drifting past him in the fog , caught in an inexorable current carrying her ever farther away . He slept in his car that night , up by the Marina , where he hoped no one would bother him . No one did . Morning light awakened him after a few hours - his wristwatch said it was 9:45 p.m. on the same August day when all this had started , but he knew better now than to regard what his watch told him as having any meaning - and when he stepped outside the day was dry and clear , with a blue summer sky overhead and the sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a summer day . He was getting used to the ever-changing weather by now , though , the swift parade of seasons tumbling upon him one after another . Each new one would hold him for a little while in that odd enclosed way , but then it would release its grasp and nudge him onward into the next one . He checked the newspaper box on the corner . San Francisco Chronicle , Tuesday , May 1 , 1 973 . Big front-page story : Nixon dismisses White House counsel John Dean and accepts the resignations of aides John Ehrfichman and H. R. Haldeman . Right , he thought . Dean , Ehrfichman , Haldeman : Watergate . So a whole decade had vanished while he slept . He had slipped all the way back to 1973 . He was n't even surprised . He had entered some realm beyond all possibility of surprise . Taking out his wallet , Rackman checked his driver 's license . Still the same , expires 03-1 1-1 1 , photo of his familiar fifty-something face . His car was still a silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Prius stood out like a shriek among the other parked cars , every last one of them some clunky-looking old model of the kind that he dimly remembered from his youth . What we have here is 1973 , he thought . Probably not for long , though . He had n't had anything to eat since lunchtime , ten hours and thirtyfive years ago . He drove over to Chestnut Street , marveling at the quiet old-fashioned look of all the shopfronts , and parked right outside Joe 's , which he knew had been out of business since maybe the Clinton years . There were no parking meters on the street . Rackman ordered a salad , a Joe 's Special , and a glass of red wine , and paid for it with a ten-dollar bill of the old green-and- white kind that he happened to have . Meal plus wine , $8.50 , he thought . That sounded about right for this long ago . It was a very consistent kind of hallucination . He left a dollar tip . Rackman remembered pretty well what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was twenty-two that year , out of college almost a year , working in Cody 's Books on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley while waiting to get into law school , for which he had been turned down the first time around but which he had high hopes of entering that autumn . He and Al Mortenson , another young Cody 's clerk - nice steady guy , easy to get along with - were rooming together in a little upstairs apartment on Dana , two or three blocks from the bookshop . Whatever had happened to old Al ? Rackman had lost touch with him many years back . A powerful urge seized him now to drive across to Berkeley and look for him . He had n't spoken with anyone except those two hotel clerks since he had left the car lot , what felt like a million years ago , and a terrible icy loneliness was beginning to settle over him as he went spinning onward through his constantly unraveling world . He needed to reach out to someone , anyone , for whatever help he could find . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was levelheaded ; Al was unf lusterable , - Al was steady . What about driving over to Berkeley now and looking for Al at the Dana Street place ? - " I know you do n't recognize me , Al , but I 'm actually Phil Rackman , only I 'm from 2008 , and I 'm having some sort of bad trip and I need to sit down in a quiet place with a good friend like you and figure out what 's going on . " Rackman wondered what that would accomplish . Probably nothing , but at least it might provide him with half an hour of companionship , sympathy , even understanding . At worst Al would think he was . a lunatic and he would wind up under sedation at Alta Bates Hospital while they tried to find his next of kin . If he really was sliding constantly backward in time he would slip away from Alta Bates too , Rackman thought , and if not , if he was simply unhinged , maybe a hospital was where he belonged . He went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter while he was crossing the bridge : in Berkeley the acacias were in bloom , great clusters of golden yellow flowers , and that was a January thing . The sight of Berkeley in early 1973 , a year that had in fact been the last gasp of the Sixties , gave him a shiver : the Day-Glo rock-concert posters on all the walls , the flower-child costumes , the huge , bizarre helmets of shaggy hair that everyone was wearing . The streets were strangely clean , hardly any litter , no graffiti . It all was like a movie set , a careful , loving reconstruction of the era . He had no business being here . He was entirely out of place . And yet he had lived here once . This street belonged to his own past . He had lost Jenny , he had lost his nice condominium , he had lost his car dealership , but other things that he had thought were lost , like this Day-Glo tie-dyed world of his youth , were coming back to him . Only they were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one they would present themselves , tantalizing flashes of a returning past , and then they 'd go streaming onward , lost to him like everything else , lost for a second and terribly final time . He guessed from the position of the pale winter sun , just coming up over the hills to the east , that the time was eight or nine in the morning . If so , Al would probably still be at home . The Dana Street place looked just as Rackman remembered it , a tidy little frame building , the landlady 's tiny but immaculate garden of pretty succulents out front , the redwood deck , the staircase on the side that led to the upstairs apartment . As he started upward an unsettling burst of panic swept through him at the possibility that he might come face to face with his own younger self . But in a moment his trepidation passed . It would n't happen , he told himself . It was just too impossible . There had to be a limit to this thing somewhere . A kid answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lanky guy in jeans and a T-shirt , with a long oval face almost completely engulfed in an immense spherical mass of jet-black hair that covered his forehead and his cheeks and his chin , a wild woolly tangle that left only eyes and nose and lips visible . A golden peace-symbol amulet dangled on a silver chain around his neck . My God , Rackman thought , this really is the Al I knew in 1973 . Like a ghost out of time . But J am the ghost . J am the ghost . " Yes ? " the kid at the door said vaguely . " Al Mortenson , right ? " " Yes . " He said it in an uneasy way , chilly , distant , grudging . What the hell , some unknown elderly guy at the door , an utter stranger wanting God only knew what , eight or nine in the morning : even the unflappable Al might be a little suspicious . Rackman saw no option but to launch straight into his story . " I realize this is going to sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear with me. - Do I look in any way familiar to you , Al ? " He would n't , naturally . He was much stockier than the Phil Rackman of 1973 , his full-face beard was ancient history and his once-luxurious russet hair was close-cropped and gray , and he was wearing a checked suit of the kind that nobody , not even a middle-aged man , would have worn in 1973 . But he began to speak , quietly , earnestly , intensely , persuasively , his best one-foot-in-the-door salesman approach , the approach he might have used if he had been trying to sell his biggest model SUV to a frail old lady from the Rossmoor retirement home . Starting off by casually mentioning Al 's roommate Phil Rackman - " he is n't here , by any chance , is he ? " - no , he was n't , thank God - and then asking Al once again to prepare himself for a very peculiar tale indeed , giving him no chance to reply , and swiftly and smoothly working around to the notion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the actual Phil Rackman who been his roommate back in 1973 , only in fact he was the Phil Rackman of the year 2008 who had without warning become caught up in what could only be described as an inexplicable toboggan-slide backward across time . Even through that forest of facial hair Al 's reactions were readily discernible : puzzlement at first , then annoyance verging on anger , then a show of curiosity , a flicker of interest at the possibility of such a wild thing - hey , man , far out ! Cool ! - and then , gradually , gradually , gradually bringing himself to the tipping point , completing the transition from skepticism verging on hostility to mild curiosity to fascination to stunned acceptance , as Rackman began to conjure up remembered episodes of their shared life that only he could have known . That time in the summer of " 72 when he and Al and their current girlfriends had gone camping in the Sierras and had been happily screwing away on a flat smooth granite outcropping next to a mountain stream in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level , when a wide-eyed party of Boy Scouts came marching past them down the trail ; and that long-legged girl from Oregon Rackman had picked up one weekend who turned out to be double-jointed , or whatever , and showed them both the most amazing sexual tricks , - and the great moment when they and some friends had scored half a pound of hash and gave a party that lasted three days running without time out for sleep ; and the time when he and Al had hitchhiked down to Big Sur , he with big , cuddly Ginny Beardsley and Al with hot little Nikki Rosenzweig , during Easter break , and the four of them had dropped a little acid and gone absolutely gonzo berserk together in a secluded redwood grove - " No , " Al said . " That has n't happened yet . Easter is still three months away . And I do n't know any Nikki Rosenzweig . " Rackman rolled his eyes lasciviously . " You will , kiddo . Believe me , you will ! Ginny will introduce you , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own future . " " For me it is n't the future , " Rackman said . " It 's the long-ago past . When you and I were rooming together right here on Dana Street and having the time of our lives . " " But how is this possible ? " " You think I know , old pal ? All I know is that it 's happening . I 'm me , really me , sliding backward in time . It 's the truth . Look at my face , Al . Run a computer simulation in your mind , if you can - hell , people do n't have their own computers yet , do they ? - well , just try to age me up , in your imagination , gray hair , more weight , but the same nose , Al , the same mouth - " He shook his head . " Wait a second . Look at this . " He drew out his driver 's license and thrust it at the other man . " You see the name ? The photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ datei March 201 1 ? Here , look at these fifty-dollar bills ! The dates on them . This credit card , this Visa . Do you even know what a Visa is ? Did we have them back in 1973 ? " " Christ , " Al said , in a husky , barely audible whisper . " Jesus Christ , Phil . - It 's okay if I call you Phil , right ? " " Phil , yes . " " Look , Phil - " That same thin ghostly whisper , the voice of a man in shock . Rackman had never , in the old days , seen Al this badly shaken up . " The bookstore 's about to open . I 've got to get to work . You come in , wait here , make yourself at home . " Then a little manic laugh : " You are at home , are n't you ? In a manner of speaking . So wait here . Rest . Relax . Smoke some of my dope , if you want . You probably know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one , and we can go out to lunch and talk about all this , okay ? I want to know all about it . What year did you say you came from ? 2011 ? " " 2008. " " 2008 . Christ , this is so wild ! - You 'll stay here , then ? " " And if my younger self walks in on me ? " " Do n't worry . You 're safe . He 's in Los Angeles this week . " " Groovy , " Rackman said , wondering if anyone still said things like that . " Go on , then . Go to work . I 'll see you later . " THE TWO ROOMS , Al 's and his own just across the hall , were like museum exhibits : the posters for Fillmore West concerts , the antique stereo set and the stack of LP records , the tie-dyed shirts and bell-bottom pants scattered in the corner , the bong on the dresser , the macram wall hangings , the musty aroma of last night 's incense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times close to tears as he looked at this artifact of that ancient era and that one , The Teachings of Don Juan , The White Album , The Whole Earth Catalog . His own copies . He still had the Castaeda book somewhere , - he remembered the beer stain on the cover . He peered into the dresser drawer where Al kept his stash , scooped up a pinch of it in his fingers and sniffed it , smiled , put it back . It was years since he had smoked . Decades . He ran his hand over his cheek . His stubble was starting to bother him . He had n't shaved since yesterday morning on Rackman body time . He knew there 'd be a shaver in the bathroom , though - he did n't like beards , had never worn one even in the Seventies - and , yes , there was his old Norelco three-headed job . He felt better with clean cheeks . Rackman stuffed the shaver into his inside jacket pocket , knowing he 'd want it in the days ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a towaway zone . They had always been very tough about illegally parked cars in Berkeley . You could try to assassinate the president and get off with a six-month sentence , but God help you if you parked in a tow-away zone . And if they took his car away , he 'd be in an even worse pickle than he already was . The car was his one link to the world he had left behind , his time capsule , his home , now , actually . The car was still where he had left it . But he was afraid to leave it for long . It might slip away from him in the next time-shift . He got in , thinking to wait in it until it was time to meet Al for lunch . But although it was still just midmorning he felt drowsiness overcoming him , and almost instantly he dozed off . When he awakened he saw that it was dark outside . He must have slept the day away . The dashboard clock told him it was 1:15 p.m. , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too late for lunch with Al . Maybe they could have dinner instead . On the way over to the bookstore , marveling every step of the way at the utter weirdness of everybody he passed in the streets , the strange beards , the flamboyant globes of hair , the gaudy clothing . Rackman began to see that it would be very embarrassing to tell Al that he had grown up to own a suburban automobile dealership . He had planned to become a legal advocate for important social causes , or perhaps a public defender , or an investigator of corporate malfeasance . Everybody had noble plans like that , back then . Going into the car business had n't been on anyone 's screen . Then he saw that he did n't have to tell Al anything about what he had come to do for a living . It was a long story and not one that Al was likely to find interesting . Al would n't care that he had become a car dealer . Al was sufficiently blown away by the mere fact that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the future that morning . He entered the bookstore and spotted Al over near the cash register . But when he waved he got only a blank stare in return . " I 'm sorry I missed our lunch date , Al . I guess I just nodded off . It 's been a pretty tiring day for me , you know . " There was no trace of recognition on Al 's face . " Sir ? There must be some mistake . " " Al Mortenson ? Who lives on Dana Street ? " " I 'm Al Mortenson , yes . I live in Bowles Hall , though . " Bowles Hall was a campus dormitory . Undergraduates lived there . This Al had n't graduated yet . This Al 's hair was different too , Rackman saw now . A tighter cut , more disciplined , more forehead showing . And his beard was much longer , cascading down over his chest , hiding the peace symbol . He might have had a haircut during the day but he could n't have grown four inches more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counter next to the register , the New York Times . Rackman flicked a glance at the top one . November 10 , 1971 . I have n't just slept away the afternoon , Rackman thought . I 've slept away all of 1972 . He and Al had n't rented the Dana Street place until after graduation , in June of " 72 . Fumbling , trying to recover , always the nice helpful guy , Al said , " You are n't Mr. Chesley , are you ? Bud Chesley 's father ? " Bud Chesley had been a classmate of theirs , a jock , big , broadshouldered . The main thing that Rackman remembered about him was that he had been one of about six men on campus who were in favor of the war in Vietnam . Rackman seemed to recall that in his senior year Al had roomed with Chesley in Bowles , before he and Al had known each other . " No , " Rackman said leadenly . " I 'm not Mr. Chesley . I 'm really sorry to have bothered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had suspected it all along , but now , feeling the past tugging at him as he hurried back to his car , it was certain . The slippage made any sort of human interaction lasting more than half an hour or so impossible to sustain . He struggled with it , trying to tug back , to hold fast against the sliding , hoping that perhaps he could root himself somehow in the present and then begin the climb forward again until he reached the place where he belonged . But he could feel the slippage continuing , not at any consistent rate but in sudden unpredictable bursts , and there was nothing he could do about it . There were times when he was completely unaware of it until it had happened and other times when he could see the seasons rocketing right by in front of his eyes . Without any particular destination in mind Rackman returned to his car , wandered around Berkeley until he found himself heading down Ashby Avenue to the freeway , and drove back into San Francisco . The toll was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridge all seemed like collector 's items , with yellow-and-black license plates , three digits , three letters . He wondered what a highway patrolman would say about his own plates , if he recognized them as California plates at all . Halfway across the bridge Rackman turned the radio on , hoping the car might be able to pick up a news broadcast out of 2008 , but no , no , when he got KCBS he heard the announcer talking about President Johnson , Secretary of State Rusk , Vietnam , Israel refusing to give back Jerusalem after the recent war with the Arab countries , Dr. Martin Luther King calling for calm following a night of racial strife in Hartford , Connecticut . It was hard to remember some of the history exactly , but Rackman knew that Dr. King had been assassinated in 1968 , so he figured that just in the course of crossing the bridge he probably had slid back into 1967 or even 1966 . He had been in high school then . All the sweaty anguish of that whole lunatic era came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , the body counts on the nightly news , Malcolm X , peace marches , the strident 1968 political convention in Chicago , the race riots , Nixon , Hubert Humphrey , Mao Tse-tung , spacemen in orbit around the moon , Lady Bird Johnson , Cassius Clay .

But he had driven right into the thick of it . THE SLIPPAGE CONTINUED . The long hair went away , the granny glasses , the Day-Glo posters , the tie-dyed clothes . John F. Kennedy came and went in reverse . Night and day seemed to follow one another in random sequence . Rackman ate his meals randomly too , no idea whether it was breakfast or lunch or dinner that he needed . He had lost all track of personal time . He caught naps in his car , kept a low profile , said very little to anyone . A careless restaurant cashier took one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stack of spendable bills in change . He doled those bills out parsimoniously , watching what he spent even though meals , like the bridge toll , like the cost of a newspaper , like everything else back here , were astoundingly cheap , a nickel or a dime for this , fifty cents for that . San Francisco was smaller , dingier , a little old 1950s-style town , no trace of the highrise buildings now . Everything was muted , old-fashioned , the simpler , more innocent textures of his childhood . He half expected it all to be in black and white , as an old newsreel would be , and perhaps to flicker a little . But he took in smells , breezes , sounds , that no newsreel could have captured . This was n't any newsreel and it was n't any hallucination , either . This was the world itself , dense , deep , real . All too real , unthinkably real . And there was no place for him in it . Men wore hats , women 's coats had padded shoulders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets . A little while later , though , the sky brightened and the dry , cold winds of San Francisco summer came whistling eastward at him again out of the Pacific , and then , presto jingo , the previous winter 's rainy season was upon him . He wondered which year 's winter it was . It was 1953 , the newspaper told him . The corner newspaper rack was his only friend . It provided him with guidance , information about his present position in time . That was Eisenhower on the front page . The Korean war was still going on , here in 1953 . And Stalin : Stalin had just died . Rackman remembered Eisenhower , the president of his childhood , kindly old Ike . Truman 's bespectacled face would be next . Rackman had been born during Truman 's second term . He had no recollection of the Truman presidency but he could recall the salty old Harry of later years , who went walking every day , gabbing with reporters about anything that came into his head . What is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back past my own birthdate ? Maybe he would come to some glittering gateway , a giant sizzling special effect throwing off fireworks across the whole horizon , with a blue-white sheen of nothingness stretching into infinity beyond it . And when he passed through it he would disappear into oblivion and that would be that . He 'd find out soon enough . He could n't be much more than a year or two away from the day of his birth . Without knowing or caring where he was going , Rackman began to drive south out of San Francisco , the poky little San Francisco of this far-off day , heading out of town on what once had been Highway 101 , the freeway that led to the airport and San Jose and , eventually , Los Angeles . It was n't a freeway now , just an oddly charming little four-lane road . The billboards that lined it on both sides looked like ads from old National Geographies . The curving rows of small ticky-tacky houses on the hillsides had n't been built yet . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city . The ballpark was n't there - the Giants still played in New York in this era , he recalled - and when he went past the airport , he almost failed to notice it , it was such a piffling little small-town place . Only when a DC-3 passed overhead like a huge droning mosquito did he realize that that collection of tin sheds over to the left was what would one day be SFO . Rackman knew that he was still slipping and slipping as he went , that the pace of slippage seemed to be picking up , that if that glittering gateway existed he had already gone beyond it . He was somewhere near 1945 now or maybe even earlier - they were honking at his car on the road in amazement , as though it was a spaceship that had dropped down from Mars - and now a clear , cold understanding of what was in store for him was growing in his mind . He would n't disappear through any gateway . It did n't matter that he had n't been born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he was n't growing any younger as he drifted backward . And the deep past waited for him . He saw that he would just go endlessly onward , cut loose from the restraints that time imposed , drifting on and on back into antiquity . While he was driving southward , heading for San Jose or Los Angeles or wherever it was that he might be going next , the years would roll along backward , the twentieth century would be gobbled up in the nineteenth , California 's great cities would melt away - he had already seen that happening in San Francisco - and the whole state would revert to the days of Mexican rule , a bunch of little villages clustered around the Catholic missions , and then the villages and the missions would disappear too . A day or two later for him , California would be an emptiness , nobody here but simple Indian tribes . Farther to the east , in the center of the continent , great herds of bison would roam . Still farther east would be the territory of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then vanishing also . Well , he thought , if he could get himself across the country quickly enough , he might be able to reach New York City - Nieuw Amsterdam , it would probably be by then - while it still existed . There he might be able to arrange a voyage across to Europe before the continent reverted entirely to its pre-Columbian status . But what then ? All that he could envisage was a perpetual journey backward , backward , ever backward : the Renaissance , the Dark Ages , Rome , Greece , Babylon , Egypt , the Ice Age . A couple of summers ago he and Jenny had taken a holiday in France , down in the Dordogne , where they had looked at the painted caves of the Cro-Magnon men , the colorful images of bulls and bison and spotted horses and mammoths . No one knew what those pictures meant , why they had been painted . Now he would go back and find out at first hand the answer to the enigmas of the prehistoric caves . How very cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except that if you gave it half a second 's thought it was appalling . To whom would he impart that knowledge ? What good would it do him , or anyone ? The deep past was waiting for him , yes . But would he get there ? Even a Prius was n't going to make it all the way across North America on a single tank of gas , and soon there were n't going to be any gas stations , and even if there were he would have no valid money to pay for gas , or food , or anything else . Pretty soon there would be no roads , either . He could n't walk to New York . In that wilderness he would n't last three days . He had kept himself in motion up until this moment , staying just ahead of the vast gray grimness that was threatening to invade his soul , but it was catching up with him now . Rackman went through ten or fifteen minutes that might have been the darkest , bleakest moments of his life . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little road , no longer the roaring Highway 101 but now just a dusty , narrow two-laner with hardly any traffic ? - there came an unexpected change in his mood . He grew indifferent to his fate . In an odd way he found himself actually welcoming whatever might come . The prospect before him looked pretty terrifying , yes . But it might just be exciting , too . He had liked his life , he had liked it very much , but it had been torn away from him , he knew not how or why . This was his life now . He had no choice about that . The best thing to do , Rackman thought , was to take it one century at a time and try to enjoy the ride . What he needed right now was a little breather : come to a halt if only for a short while , pause and regroup . Stop and pass the time , so to speak , as he got himself ready for the next phase of his new existence . He pulled over by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat there quietly , thinking about nothing at all . After a while a youngish man on a motorcycle pulled up alongside him . The motorcycle was hardly more than a souped-up bike . The man was wearing a khaki blouse and khaki trousers , all pleats and flounces , a very old-fashioned outfit , something like a scoutmaster 's uniform . He himself had an old-fashioned look , too , dark hair parted in the middle like an actor in a silent movie . Then Rackman noticed the California Highway Patrol badge on the man 's shoulder . He opened the car window . The patrolman leaned toward him and gave him an earnest smile , a Boy Scout smile . Even the smile was old-fashioned . You could n't help believing the sincerity of it . " Is there any difficulty , sir ? May I be of any assistance ? " So polite , so formal . Sir . Everyone had been calling him sir since this trip had started , the desk clerks , the people in restaurants , Al Mortenson , and now this CHP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in prehistory . " No , " Rackman said . " No problem . Everything 's fine . " The patrolman did n't seem to hear him . He had turned his complete attention to Rackman " s car itself , the glossy silver Prius , the car out of the future . The look of it was apparently sinking in for the first time . He was staring at the car in disbelief , in befuddlement , in unconcealed jawsagging awe , gawking at its fluid streamlined shape , at its gleaming futuristic dashboard . Then he turned back to Rackman himself , taking in the look of his clothing , his haircut , his checked jacket , his patterned shirt . The man 's eyes seemed to glaze . Rackman knew that there had to be something about his whole appearance that seemed as wrong to the patrolman as the patrolman 's did to him . He could see the man working to get himself under control . The car must have him completely flummoxed , Rackman thought . The patrolman began to say something but it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he said , hoarsely , like a rusty automaton determined to go through its routine no matter what , " I want you to know , sir , that if you are having any problem with your - ah - your car , we are here to assist you in whatever way we can . " To assist you . That was a good one . Rackman managed a faint smile . " Thanks , but the car 's okay , " he said . " And I 'm okay too . I just stopped off here to rest a bit , that 's all . I 've got a long trip ahead of me . " He reached for the ignition key . Silently , smoothly , the Prius floated forward into the morning fight and the night that would quickly follow it and into the random succession of springs and winters and autumns and summers beyond , forward into the mysteries , dark and dreadful and splendid , that lay before him .                @ @ @ @ @
