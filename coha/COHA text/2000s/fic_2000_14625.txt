An apartment . Minimalist set . A young woman , Carla , on the phone . CARLA In love with me ? You 're in love with me ? Could you describe yourself again ? Uh-huh . Uh-huh . And you spoke to me ? ( A knock at the door . ) Listen , I always hate to interrupt a marriage proposal , butcould you possibly hold that thought ? ( Puts phone down and goes to door . Bethany , the same age as Carla and a friend , is there . She carries the sort of Mideastern lamp we know of from Aladdin . ) BETHANY Thank God you were home . I mean , you 're not going to believe this ! CARLA Somebody on the phone . ( Goes back to it . ) BETHANY I mean , I just had a beach urge , so I told them at work my uncle was dying CARLA ( Motions to Bethany for quiet . ) And you were the one in the leather jacket with the tattoo ? What was the tattoo ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she should hang up , to cool it . ) Look , a screaming eagle from shoulder to shoulder , maybe . There were a lot of people in the bar . BETHANY ( Gesturing and mouthing . ) I have to get back to work . p. 3 CARLA ( On phone . ) See , the thing is , I 'm probably not going to marry someone I ca n't rememberparticularly when I do n't drink . Sorry . Sorry . Sorry . ( She hangs up . ) Madness . BETHANY So I ran out to the beach CARLA This was some guy I never met who apparently offered me a beer BETHANY low tide and this ( The lamp. ) was just sitting there , lying there CARLA and he tracks me down BETHANY on the beach , and I lift this lid thing CARLA and seriously proposes marriage . BETHANY and a genie comes out . CARLA I mean , that 's twice in awhat ? BETHANY A genie comes out of this thing . CARLA A genie ? BETHANY I 'm not kidding , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then this twenty-foot-high , see-through guy in like an Arabian outfit . CARLA Very funny . p. 4 BETHANY Yes , funny , but twenty feet high ! I look up and down the beach , I 'm alone . I do n't have my pepper spray or my hand alarm . You know me , when I 'm petrified I joke . I say his voice is too high for Robin Williams , and he says he 's a castrati . Naturally . Who else would I meet ? CARLA What 's a castrati ? BETHANY You know ( The appropriate gesture . ) CARLA Bethany , dear one , I have three modeling calls . I am meeting Ralph Lauren ! BETHANY Okay , good . Ralph Lauren . Look , I am not kidding ! CARLA You 're not kidding what ? ! BETHANY There is a genie in this thingamajig . CARLA Uh-huh . I 'll be back around eight . BETHANY And he offered me wishes ! CARLA Is this some elaborate practical joke because it 's my birthday ? BETHANY No , happy birthday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserted beach with a twenty-foot-high , see-through genie , so like sarcasticallyyou know how I need a new carI said fine , gim me 25,000 dollars CARLA On the beach with the genie ? p. 5 BETHANY Yeah , right , exactly , and it rains down out of the sky . CARLA Oh sure . BETHANY ( Pulling a wad out of her purse . ) Count it , those are thousands . I lost one in the surf . ( Carla sees the top bill . Looks at Bethany , who nods encouragement . Carla thumbs through them . ) CARLA These look real . BETHANY Yeah . CARLA And they rained down out of the sky ? BETHANY Yeah . CARLA You 've been really strange lately , are you dealing ? BETHANY Dealing what , I 've even given up chocolate . CARLA Let me see the genie . BETHANY Wait , wait . CARLA Bethany , I do n't have time to screw around . Let me see the genie or let me go on my appointments . BETHANY Wait ! So I pick up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm like nuts so I say , you know , " Okay , look , ummm , big guy , my uncle is in the hospital " because as you know when I said to the people at work my uncle was dying , I was on one level telling the truth although it had nothing to do with the beach , but he was in Intensive Care after the accident , and that 's on my mind , so I say , okay , Genie , heal my unclewhich is like impossible given he was hit by two trucks , and the genie says , " Yes , Master " like they 're supposed to say , and he goes into this like kind of whirlwind , kicking up sand and stuff , and I 'm like , " Oh my God ! " and the air clears , and he bows , you know , and says , " It is done , Master , " and I say , " Okay , whatever-you-are , I 'm calling on my cell phone , " and I get it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says my uncle came to , walked out of Intensive Care and left the hospital ! I 'm not kidding , Carla . p. 6 CARLA On your mother 's grave ? BETHANY On my mother 's grave . ( They look at each other . ) CARLA Let me see the genie . BETHANY No , no , look , that 's the whole thingI was just , like , reacting , you know , responding , and that 's already two wishesalthough I 'm really pleased about my uncle , the $25,000 thing , I could have asked for $10 million , and there is only one wish left . CARLA So ask for $10 million . BETHANY I do n't think so . I do n't think so . I mean , I got ta focus in here . Do you have a sparkling water ? CARLA No . Bethany , I 'm missing Ralph Lauren now . Very possibly my one chance to go from catalogue model to the very , very big time , so , if you are joking , stop joking . BETHANY Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know what I want . In my guts . Yes . Underneath my entire bitch of a life is this unspoken , ferocious , all-consuming urge CARLA ( Trying to get her to move this along . ) Ferocious , all-consuming urge BETHANY I want to be like you . CARLA Me ? p. 7 BETHANY Yes . CARLA Half the time you do n't even like me . BETHANY Jealous . The ogre of jealousy . CARLA You 're the one with the $40,000 job straight out of school . You 're the one who has published short stories . I 'm the one hanging on by her finger-nails in modeling . The one who has creeps calling her on the phone . The one who had to have a nose job . BETHANY I want to be beautiful . CARLA You are beautiful . BETHANY Carla , I 'm not beautiful . CARLA You have charm . You have personality . You know perfectly well you 're pretty . BETHANY " Pretty , " see , that 's it . Pretty is the minor leagues of beautiful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Beautiful is what knocks them out across the room . Pretty , you get called a couple of times a year ; beautiful is twenty-four hours a day . CARLA Yeah ? So ? BETHANY So ? ! We 're talking beauty here . Do n't say " So ? " Beauty is the real deal . You are the center of any moment of your life . People stare . Men flock . I 've seen you get offered discounts on makeup for no reason . Parents treat beautiful children better . Studies show your income goes up . You can have sex anytime you want it . Men have to know me . That takes up to a year . I 'm continually horny. p. 8 CARLA Bethany , I do n't even like sex . I ca n't have a conversation without men coming on to me . I have no privacy . I get hassled on the street . They start pressuring me from the beginning . Half the time , it never occurs to them to start with a conversation . Smart guys like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're only twenty-three . I have n't had one . The good guys , the smart guys are scared to death of me . I 'm surrounded by male bimbos who think a preposition is when you go to school away from home . I have no woman friends except you . I do n't even want to talk about this ! BETHANY I knew you 'd say something like this . See , you 're " in the club " so you can say this . It 's the way beauty functions as an elite . You 're trying to keep it all for yourself . CARLA I 'm trying to tell you it 's no picnic . BETHANY But it 's what everybody wants . It 's the nasty secret at large in the world . It 's the unspoken tidal desire in every room and on every street . It 's the unspoken , the soundless whispermillions upon millions of people longing hopelessly and forever to stop being whatever they are and be beautiful , but the difference between those ardent multitudes and me is that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , it 's not what I want . This is me , Carla . I have never read a whole book . Page six , I ca n't remember page four . The last thing I read was The complete Idiot 's Guide to WordPerfect . I leave dinner parties right after the dessert because I 'm out of conversation . You know the dumb blond joke about the application where it says , " Sign here , " she put Sagittarius ? I 've done that . Only beautiful guys approach me , and that 's because they want to borrow my eye shadow . I barely exist outside a mirror ! You do n't want to be me. p. 9 BETHANY None of you tell the truth . That 's why you have no friends . We can all see you 're just trying to make us feel better because we are n't in your league . This only proves to me it should be my third wish . Money can only buy things . Beauty makes you the center of the universe . ( Bethany picks up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bethany , do n't wish it ! I am telling you you 'll regret it . ( Bethany lifts the lid . There is a tremendous crash , and the lights go out . Then they flicker and come back up , revealing Bethany and Carla on the floor where they have been thrown by the explosion . We do n't realize it at first , but they have exchanged places . ) CARLA/BETHANY Oh God . BETHANY/CARLA Oh God . CARLA/BETHANY Am I bleeding ? Am I dying ? BETHANY/CARLA I 'm so dizzy . You 're not bleeding . CARLA/BETHANY Neither are you . BETHANY/CARLA I feel so weird . CARLA/BETHANY Me too . I feel ( Looking at her hands . ) Oh , my God , I 'm wearing your jewelry . I 'm wearing your nail polish . BETHANY/CARLA I know I 'm over here , but I can see myself over there . p. 10 CARLA/BETHANY I 'm wearing your dress . I have your legs ! ! BETHANY/CARLA These are n't my shoes . I ca n't meet Ralph Lauren wearing these shoes ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to be you . BETHANY/CARLA Thanks a lot ! ! CARLA/BETHANY I 've got to go . I want to pick someone out and get laid . BETHANY/CARLA You ca n't just walk out of here in my body ! CARLA/BETHANY Wait a minute . Wait a minute . What 's eleven eighteenths of 1,726 ? BETHANY/CARLA Why ? CARLA/BETHANY I 'm a public accountant . I want to know if you have my brain . BETHANY/CARLA One hundred thirty-two and a half . CARLA/BETHANY You have my brain . BETHANY/CARLA What shade of Rubenstein lipstick does Cindy Crawford wear with teal blue ? CARLA/BETHANY Raging Storm . BETHANY/CARLA You have my brain . You poor bastard . CARLA/BETHANY I do n't care . Do n't you see ? BETHANY/CARLA See what ? CARLA/BETHANY We both have the one thing , the one and only thing everybody wants . p. 11 BETHANY/CARLA What is that ? CARLA/BETHANY It 's better than beauty for me ; it 's better than brains for you . BETHANY/CARLA What ? What ? ! CARLA/BETHANY Different problems . ( Blackout. )    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
