When we were kids playing Pop Warner football , we used to take to heart the words emblazoned on our coach 's shirt : " No pain , no gain . No guts , no glory . " If you did n't feel well , you sucked it in . If you were injured , you taped it up . If you took a hit on the head  --  got your " bell rung , " as we used to say  --  you just shook it off and got back on the field . <P> It 's surprising how many players and coaches still feel that way about sports-related concussions and other head injuries  --  surprising because we now know the internal swelling and other damage caused by repeated concussions can be additive , making the brain susceptible to further injury . Returning to the field after a mind-altering blow to the head might win football games , but it can also permanently impair development and lead to serious brain damage or even death . <P> Each year more than 300,000 American athletes sustain brain injuries of varying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take part in contact sports , the more dangerous these blows to the head become . <P> The human brain is particularly vulnerable as it develops through childhood and into the teenage years , finally maturing when we reach our 20s . As the brain develops , windows open up and the mind has its best opportunity to acquire knowledge and easily learn new skills , such as speaking a foreign language . If the window closes  --  either with the normal passage of time or because the brain has been damaged  --  learning that language can be much harder . <P> So how do you know when a child with a banged head should return to competition ? There is no simple answer . The American Academy of Neurology , however , has developed a new system that can be used as a guideline . Concussions are divided into three categories : Grades 1 , 2 and 3 . <P> A child with a Grade 1 concussion does not lose consciousness but may experience a range of symptoms that include headache , mild dizziness , ringing in the ear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than 15 minutes , but the child should be removed from the contest , examined immediately and then re-examined at five-minute intervals . If the symptoms clear within a few minutes , the child can return to play . <P> In a Grade 2 concussion , there is still no loss of consciousness , but the other symptoms may last more than 15 minutes . A child with such symptoms should be examined by a physician , and if still symptom free after a week , can return to competition . <P> A Grade 3 concussion , the most severe , occurs when a player loses consciousness for anywhere from a few seconds to several hours . An injured child should be transported off the field in a neck brace to protect the spinal column and taken immediately to a hospital . Returning to competition depends on how long the child was unconscious and how long it took for the other symptoms to resolve . <P> What 's most important to remember is that a person with a concussion may look fine and speak clearly but still be suffering severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports , one should be examined by a trained professional . There 's always another game , but we 're never going to have another brain . Dr. Ian appears on WNBC-TV in New York . E-mail him at
