Introduction // It hurts so bad that I can not save him , protect him , // keep him out of harm 's way , shield him from pain . // What good are fathers if not for these things ? //  --  Thomas Lynch , " The Way We Are " // " Howdy Pop , God , I miss you guys so much . I ca n't wait to see you all . Only // one more day ! ! ! Woo-hoo. " // Nic is emailing from college on the evening before he arrives home // for summer vacation . Jasper and Daisy , our eight- and five-year- olds , are // sitting at the kitchen table cutting , pasting , and coloring notes and welcome- // home banners for his homecoming . They have not seen their big brother in // six months . // In the morning , when it 's time to leave for the airport , I go outside // to round them up . Daisy , wet and muddy , is perched on a branch high up in a // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me that back or else ! " he // warns . // " No , " she responds . " It 's mine . " There is bold defiance in her eyes , // but then , when he starts to climb up the tree , she throws down the Gandalf // doll he 's after . // " It 's time to go get Nic , " I say , and they dash past me into the // house , chanting , " Nicky Nicky Nicky . " // We drive the hour and a half to the airport . When we reach the // terminal , Jasper yells , " There 's Nic . " He points . " There ! " // Nic , an army green duffel bag slung over his shoulder , leans // against a NO PARKING sign on the curb outside United baggage claim . // Lanky thin in a faded red T-shirt and his girlfriend 's cardigan , sagging jeans // that ride below his bony hips , and red Converse All-Stars , when he sees us , // his face brightens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit next to him and so , after throwing his // bags into the way back , he climbs over Jasper and buckles in between them . // In turn he clasps each of their heads between the palms of his hands and // kisses their cheeks . " It 's so good to see you , " he says . " I missed you little // boinkers . Like crazy . " To us up front , he adds , " You , too , Pops and Mama . " // As I drive away from the airport , Nic describes his flight . " It was // the worst , " he says . " I was stuck next to a lady who would n't stop talking . // She had platinum hair with peaks like on lemon meringue pie . Cruella De Vil // horn-rimmed eyeglasses and prune lips and thick pink face powder . " // " Cruella De Vil ? " Jasper asks . He is wide-eyed . // Nic nods . " Just like her . Her eyelashes were long and false  --  // purple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He holds his // nose . " Yech . " The kids are rapt . // We drive across the Golden Gate Bridge . A river of thick fog pours // below us and wraps around the Marin Headlands . Jasper asks , " Nic , are you // coming to Step-Up ? " referring to his and Daisy 's upcoming graduation // celebration . The kids are stepping up from second grade to third and // kindergarten to first grade . // " Would n't miss it for all the tea in China , " Nic responds . // Daisy asks , " Nic , do you remember that girl Daniela ? She fell off // the climbing structure and broke her toe . " // " Ouch . " // " She has a cast , " Jasper adds . // " A cast on her toe ? " Nic asks . " It must be teeny. " // Jasper gravely reports , " They will cut it off with a hacksaw . " // " Her toe ? " // They all giggle . // After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something for you kiddos. // In my suitcase . " // " Presents ! " // " When we get home , " he responds . // They beg him to tell them what , but he shakes his head . " No way , // Jos ? . It 's a surprise . " // I can see the three of them in the rearview mirror . Jasper and // Daisy have smooth olive complexions . Nic 's was , too , but now it 's gaunt and // rice-papery . Their eyes are brown and clear , whereas his are dark globes. // Their hair is dark brown , but Nic 's , long and blond when he was a child , is // faded like a field in late summer with smashed-down sienna patches and // sticking-up yellowed clumps  --  a result of his unfortunate attempt to bleach it // with Clorox. // " Nic , will you tell us a P. J. story ? " Jasper begs . For years Nic // has entertained the kids with The Adventures of P. J. Fumblebumble , a // British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I promise . " // We head north on the freeway , exiting and turning west , // meandering through a series of small towns , a wooded state park , and then // hilly pastureland . We stop in Point Reyes Station to retrieve the mail . It 's // impossible to be in town without running into a dozen friends , all of whom are // pleased to see Nic , bombarding him with questions about school and his // summer plans . Finally we drive off and follow the road along Papermill Creek // to our left turn , where I head up the hill and pull into our driveway . // " We have a surprise , too , Nicky , " says Daisy . // Jasper looks sternly at her . " Do n't you tell him ! " // " It 's signs . We made them . " // " Dai-sy . . . " // Lugging his bags , Nic follows the kids into the house . The dogs // charge him , barking and howling . At the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banners and drawings , including a hedgehog , captioned , " I miss // Nic , boo hoo , " drawn by Jasper . Nic praises their artistry and then trudges // into his bedroom to unpack . Since he left for college , his room , a Pompeian // red chamber at the far end of the house , has become an adjunct playroom // with a display of Jasper 's Lego creations , including a maharaja 's castle and // motorized R2-D2 . Preparing for his return , Karen cleared off Daisy 's // menagerie of stuffed animals and made up the bed with a comforter and fresh // pillows . // When Nic emerges , his arms are loaded with gifts . For Daisy , // there are Josefina and Kirsten , American Girl dolls , hand-me-downs from his // girlfriend . They are prettily dressed in , respectively , an embroidered peasant // blouse and serape and a green velvet jumper . Jasper gets a pair of cannon- // sized Super Soakers. // " After dinner , " Nic warns Jasper , " you will be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . " // " You 'll be so wet you 'll need a boat . " // " You 'll be wetter than a wet noodle. " // " You 'll be so wet that you wo n't need a shower for a year . " // Nic laughs . " That 's fine with me , " he says . " It 'll save me a lot of // time . " // We eat and then the boys fill up the squirt guns and hasten // outside into the windy evening , running in opposite directions . Karen and I // watch from the living room . Stalking each other , the boys lurk among the // Italian cypress and oaks , duck under garden furniture , and creep behind // hedges . When there 's a clean shot , they squirt each other with thin streams // of water . Hidden behind some potted hydrangeas , Daisy watches from near // the house . When the boys race past her , she twirls a spigot she 's grasping // with one hand and takes aim with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // She drenches them . // I stop the boys just as they 're about to catch her . " You do n't // deserve to be rescued , " I tell her , " but it 's bedtime . " // Jasper and Daisy take baths and put on their pajamas and then // ask Nic to read to them . // He sits on a miniature couch between their twin beds , his long // legs stretched out on the floor . He reads from The Witches , by Roald Dahl. // We hear his voice  --  voices  --  from the next room : the boy narrator , all // wonder and earnestness ; wry and creaky Grandma ; and the shrieking , haggy // Grand High Witch . // " Children are foul and filthy ! . . . Children are dirty and stinky ! // . . . Children are smelling of dogs ' drrrroppings ! . . . They are vurse // than dogs ' drrroppings ! Dogs ' drrroppings is smelling like violets and // prrrimroses compared with children ! " // Nic 's performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are // riveted by him . // At midnight , the storm that has been building finally hits . There 's a hard rain , // and intermittent volleys of hailstones pelt down like machine-gun fire on the // copper roof tiles . We rarely have electrical storms , but tonight the sky lights // up like popping flashbulbs. // Between thunderclaps , I hear the creaking of tree branches . I also // hear Nic padding along the hallway , making tea in the kitchen , quietly // strumming his guitar and playing Bj ? rk , Bollywood soundtracks , and Tom // Waits , who sings his sensible advice : " Never drive a car when you 're dead . " I // worry about Nic 's insomnia but push away my suspicions , reminding myself // how far he has come since the previous school year , when he dropped out of // Berkeley . This time , he went east to college and completed his freshman // year . Given what we have been through , this feels miraculous . By my count , // he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // methamphetamine. // In the morning the storm has passed , and the sun shimmers on the wet // maple leaves . I dress and join Karen and the little kids in the kitchen . Nic , // wearing flannel pajama bottoms , a fraying wool sweater , and x-ray specs , // shuffles in . He hovers over the kitchen counter , fussing with the espresso // maker , filling it with water and coffee and setting it on a flame , and then sits // down to a bowl of cereal with Jasper and Daisy . // " Daisy , " he says . " Your hose attack was brilliant , but I 'm going to // have to repay you for it . Watch your back . " // She cranes her neck . " I ca n't see it . " // Nic says , " I love you , you wacko. " // Soon after Daisy and Jasper leave for school , a half-dozen women // arrive to help Karen make a going-away gift for a beloved teacher . They // bejewel a concrete birdbath with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students ) tiles . As they work , they chat and sip tea . // I hide in my office . // The women are taking a lunch break in the open kitchen . One of // the mothers has brought Chinese chicken salad . Nic , who had gone back to // sleep , emerges from his bedroom , shaking off his grogginess and greeting // the women . He politely answers their questions  --  once again , about college // and his summer plans  --  and then excuses himself , saying that he 's off to a // job interview . // After he leaves , I hear the mothers talking about him . // " What a lovely boy . " // " He 's delightful . " // One comments on his good manners . " You 're very lucky , " she // tells Karen . " Our teenage son sort of grunts . Otherwise he never gives us the // time of day . " // In a couple hours , Nic returns to a quiet house  --  the mosaicing // mothers have gone home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for training as // a waiter at an Italian restaurant . Though he is aghast at the required uniform , // including stiff black shoes and a burgundy vest , he was told that he will make // piles of money in tips . // The following afternoon , after the training session , Nic practices // on us , drawing his character from the waiter in one of his memorized videos , // Lady and the Tramp . We are sitting down for dinner . With one hand aloft , // balancing an imaginary tray , he enters , singing in a lilting Italian accent , " Oh , // this is the night , it 's a beautiful night , and we call it bella notte. " // After dinner , Nic asks if he can borrow the car to go to an AA // meeting . After missed curfews and assorted other infractions , including // banging up both of our cars ( efficiently doing it in one accident , driving one // into the other ) , by last summer he had lost driving privileges , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential component of his // continued recovery  --  and so we agree . He heads out in the station wagon , // still dented from the earlier mishap . Then he dutifully returns home after the // meeting , telling us that he asked someone he met to be his sponsor while // he 's in town . // The next day he requests the car again , this time so that he can // meet the sponsor for lunch . Of course I let him . I am impressed by his // assiduousness and his adherence to the rules we have set down . He lets us // know where he 's going and when he will be home . He arrives when he // promises he will . Once again , he is gone for a brief couple hours . // The following late afternoon a fire burns in the living room . Sitting // on the twin couches , Karen , Nic , and I read while nearby , on the faded rug , // Jasper and Daisy play with Lego people . Looking up from a gnome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " boy who pushed her friend Alana . Nic // says that he will come to school and make him a " mashed meany // potatohead. " // I am surprised to hear Nic quietly snoring a while later , but at a // quarter to seven , he awakens with a start . Checking his watch , he jumps up // and says , " I almost missed the meeting , " and once again asks if he can // borrow the car . // I am pleased that though he is exhausted and would have been // content to sleep for the night , he is committed to the work of recovery , // committed enough to rouse himself , splash his face with water in the // bathroom sink , brush his hair out of his eyes with his fingers , throw on a // clean T-shirt , and race out of the house so that he will be on time . // It 's after eleven and Nic is n't home . I had been so tired , but now I 'm wide // awake in bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million harmless // explanations . Oftentimes , groups of people at AA meetings go out afterward // for coffee . Or he could be talking with his new sponsor . I contend with two // simultaneous , opposing monologues , one reassuring me that I 'm foolish and // paranoid , the other certain that something is dreadfully wrong . By now I know // that worry is useless , but it shoots in and takes over my body at the touch of // a hair trigger . I do n't want to assume the worst , but some of the times Nic // ignored his curfew , it presaged disaster . // I stare into the dark , my anxiety mounting . It is a pathetically // familiar state . I have been waiting for Nic for years . At night , past his curfew , I // would wait for the car 's grinding engine , when it pulled into the driveway and // then went silent . At last  --  Nic . The shutting car door , footsteps , the front // door opening with a click . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // chocolate Lab , usually yelped a half-hearted bark . Or I would wait for the // telephone to ring , never certain if it would be him ( " Hey , Pop , how 're ya // doin ' ? " ) or the police ( " Mr. Sheff , we have your son " ) . Whenever he was late // or failed to call , I assumed catastrophe . He was dead . Always dead . // But then Nic would arrive home , creeping up the hallway stairs , // his hand sliding along the banister . Or the telephone would ring . // " Sorry , Pop , I 'm at Richard 's house . I fell asleep . I think I 'll just // crash here rather than drive at this hour . I 'll see you in the morning . I love // you . " I would be furious and relieved , both , because I had already buried him . // Late this night , with no sign of him , I finally fall into a miserable // half-sleep . Just after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . A // garden light , equipped with a motion detector , flashes on , casting its bright // beam across the backyard . Clad in my pajamas , I slip on a pair of shoes and // go out the back door to catch him . // The night air is chilly . I hear crunching brush . // I turn the corner and come head-to-head with an enormous // startled buck , who quickly lopes away up into the garden , effortlessly leaping // over the deer fence . // Back in bed , Karen and I are wide awake . // It 's one-thirty . Now two . I double check his room . // It is two-thirty. // Finally , the sound of the car . // I confront Nic in the kitchen and he mumbles an excuse . I tell him // that he can no longer use the car . // " Whatever . " // " Are you high ? Tell me. " // " Jesus . No. " // " Nic , we had an agreement . Where were you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A bunch of people at the // meeting went back to a girl 's house to talk and then we watched a video . " // " There was no phone ? " // " I know , " he says , his anger flaring . " I said I 'm sorry . " // I snap back , " We 'll talk about this in the morning , " as he escapes // into his room , shutting his door and locking it . // At breakfast , I stare hard at Nic . The giveaway is his body , // vibrating like an idling car . His jaw gyrates and his eyes are darting opals . He // makes plans with Jasper and Daisy for after school and gives them gentle // hugs , but his voice has a prickly edge . // When Karen and the kids are gone , I say , " Nic , we have to talk . " // He eyes me warily . " About ? " // " I know you 're using again . I can tell . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about ? I 'm not . " His eyes // lock onto the floor . // " Then you wo n't mind being drug-tested. " // " Whatever . Fine . " // " OK . I want to do it now . " // " All right ! " // " Get dressed . " // " I know I should have called . I 'm not using . " He almost growls it . // " Let 's go . " // He hurries to his bedroom . Closes the door . He comes out // wearing a Sonic Youth T-shirt and black jeans . One hand is thrust in his // pocket , his head is down , his backpack is slung on one shoulder . In his other // hand he holds his electric guitar by the neck . " You 're right , " he says . He // pushes past me . " I 've been using since I came home . I was using the whole // semester . " He leaves the house , slamming the door behind him . // I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . After a few // stunned moments , I go inside again and enter his bedroom , sitting on his // unmade bed . I retrieve a crumpled-up piece of paper under the desk . Nic // wrote : // I 'm so thin and frail / // Do n't care , want another rail . // Late that afternoon , Jasper and Daisy burst in , dashing from room // to room , before finally stopping and , looking up at me , asking , " Where 's Nic ? " // I tried everything I could to prevent my son 's fall into meth addiction . It would // have been no easier to have seen him strung out on heroin or cocaine , but as // every parent of a meth addict comes to learn , this drug has a unique , horrific // quality . In an interview , Stephan Jenkins , the singer in Third Eye Blind , said // that meth makes you feel " bright and shiny . " It also makes you paranoid , // delusional , destructive , and self-destructive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel bright and shiny again . Nic had been a sensitive , // sagacious , exceptionally bright and joyful child , but on meth he became // unrecognizable . // Nic always was on the cutting edge of popular trends  --  in their // time , Care Bears , Pound Puppies , My Little Pony , Micro Machines , // Transformers , He-Man and She-ra , Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , Nintendo , // Guns N ' Roses , grunge , Beck , and many others . He was a trailblazer with // meth , too , addicted years before politicians denounced the drug as the worst // yet to hit the nation . In the United States , at least twelve million people have // tried meth , and it is estimated that more than one and a half million are // addicted to it . Worldwide , there are more than thirty-five million users ; it is // the most abused hard drug , more than heroin and cocaine combined . Nic // claimed that he was searching for meth his entire life . " When I tried it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that was that . " // Our family 's story is unique of course , but it is universal , too , in // the way that every tale of addiction resonates with every other one . I learned // how similar we all are when I first went to Al-Anon meetings . I resisted going // for a long time , but these gatherings , though they often made me weep , // strengthened me and assuaged my sense of isolation . I felt slightly less // overwhelmed . In addition , others ' stories prepared me for challenges that // would have otherwise blindsided me . They were no panacea , but I was // grateful for even the most modest relief and any guidance whatsoever . // I was frantic to try to help Nic , to stop his descent , to save my // son . This , mixed with my guilt and worry , consumed me . Since I am a writer , // it 's probably no surprise that I wrote to try to make some sense of what was // happening to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a cure that had // eluded me . I obsessively researched this drug , addiction , and treatments . I // am not the first writer for whom this work became a bludgeon with which to // battle a terrible enemy , as well as an expurgation , a grasping for something // ( anything ) fathomable amid calamity , and an agonizing process by which the // brain organizes and regulates experience and emotion that overwhelms it . In // the end , my efforts could not rescue Nic . Nor could writing heal me , though it // helped . // Other writers ' work helped , too . Whenever I pulled it off the shelf , // Thomas Lynch 's book Bodies in Motion and at Rest : On Metaphor and // Mortality opened by itself to page 95 , the essay " The Way We Are . " I read it // dozens of times , each time crying a little . With his child passed out on the // couch , after arrests and drunk tanks and hospitalizations , Lynch , the // undertaker and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sad // but lucid resignation , and he wrote : " I want to remember him the way he was , // that bright and beaming boy with the blue eyes and the freckles in the // photos , holding the walleye on his grandfather 's dock , or dressed in his first // suit for his sister 's grade-school graduation , or sucking his thumb while // drawing at the kitchen counter , or playing his first guitar , or posing with the // brothers from down the block on his first day of school . " // Why does it help to read others ' stories ? It 's not only that misery // loves company , because ( I learned ) misery is too self-absorbed to want much // company . Others ' experiences did help with my emotional struggle ; reading , I // felt a little less crazy . And , like the stories I heard at Al-Anon meetings , // others ' writing served as guides in uncharted waters . Thomas Lynch showed // me that it is possible to love a child who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an article about our family 's experience // that I submitted to the New York Times Magazine . I was terrified to invite // people into our nightmare , but was compelled to do so . I felt that telling our // story would be worthwhile if I could help anyone in the way that Lynch and // other writers helped me . I discussed it with Nic and the rest of our family . // Though encouraged by them , I was nonetheless nervous about exposing our // family to public scrutiny and judgment . But the reaction to the article // heartened me and , according to Nic , emboldened him . A book editor // contacted him and asked if he was interested in writing a memoir about his // experience , one that might inspire other young people struggling with // addiction . Nic was eager to tell his story . More significantly , he said that he // walked into AA meetings and when friends  --  or even strangers  --  made the // connection between him and the boy in the article , they offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . He said that it was a // powerful affirmation of his hard work in recovery . // I also heard from addicts and their families  --  their brothers and // sisters , children , and other relatives , and , most of all , parents  --  hundreds of // them . A few respondents were critical . One accused me of exploiting Nic for // my own purposes . Another , outraged at my description of a period when Nic // briefly wore his clothes backward , attacked , " You let him wear backward // clothes ? No wonder he became an addict . " But the great majority of letters // were outpourings of compassion , consolation , counsel , and , most of all , // shared grief . Many people seemed to feel that finally someone understood // what they were going through . This is the way that misery does love // company : People are relieved to learn that they are not alone in their // suffering , that we are part of something larger , in this case , a societal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of families . For whatever // reason , a stranger 's story seemed to give them permission to tell theirs . // They felt that I would understand , and I did . // " I am sitting here crying with shaking hands , " a man wrote . " Your // article was handed to me yesterday at my weekly breakfast of fathers who // have lost their children . The man who handed it to me lost his sixteen-year- // old son to drugs three years ago . " // " Our story is your story , " wrote another father . " Different drugs , // different cities , different rehabs , but the same story . " // And another : " At first , I was simply startled that someone had // written my story about my child without my permission . Halfway through the // emotional text of very familiar events and manifest conclusions , I realized that // the dates of significant incidents were wrong , and thereby had to conclude // that other parents may be experiencing the same inconceivable tragedies // and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired over a quarter of a century forces me to rewrite // the last paragraph : Escaping from his latest drug rehab , my son overdosed // and nearly died . Sent to a very special program in another city , he stayed // sober for almost two years , then began disappearing again , sometimes for // months , sometimes years . Having been one of the most brilliant students in // the country 's highest ranking high school , it took him twenty years to // graduate from a mediocre college . And it has taken me just as long to // discard my veil of impossible hope and admit that my son either can not or // will not ever stop using drugs . He is now forty years old , on welfare , and // resides in a home for adult addicts . " // There were so many more , many with unfathomably tragic // conclusions . " But the ending of my story is different . My son died last year of // an overdose . He was seventeen . " Another : " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she overdosed . " Another : " My daughter died . " // Another : " My son is dead . " Letters and emails still interrupt my days with // haunting reminders of the toll of addiction . My heart tears anew with each of // them . // I kept writing and , through the painstaking process , had some success // viewing our experience in a way that made sense to me  --  as much sense // as is possible to make of addiction . It led to this book . When I transformed // my random and raw words into sentences , sentences into paragraphs , and // paragraphs into chapters , a semblance of order and sanity appeared where // there had been only chaos and insanity . As with the Times article , it scares // me to publish our story . But with the continued encouragement of the // principals , I go forward . There 's no shortage of compelling memoirs by // addicts , and the best of them offer revelations for anybody who loves one . I // hope Nic 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with rare // exceptions , such as Lynch 's essay  --  we have not heard from those who // love them . Anyone who has lived through it , or those who are now living // through it , knows that caring about an addict is as complex and fraught and // debilitating as addiction itself . At my worst , I even resented Nic because an // addict , at least when high , has a momentary respite from his suffering . There // is no similar relief for parents or children or husbands or wives or others who // love them . // Nic used drugs on and off for more than a decade , and in that time I think // that I have felt and thought and done almost everything an addict 's parent can // feel and think and do . Even now , I know that there 's no single right answer , // nor even a clear road map , for families of the addicted . However , in our story , // I hope that there may be some solace , some guidance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I also hope that people can catch a glimpse of something // that seems impossible during many stages of a loved one 's addiction . // Nietzsche is often quoted for having said , " That which does not kill us makes // us stronger . " This is absolutely true for family members of an addict . Not only // am I still standing , but I know more and feel more than I once thought was // possible . // In telling our story , I resisted the temptation to foreshadow , // because it would be disingenuous  --  and a disservice to anyone going // through this  --  to suggest that one can anticipate how things will unfold . I // never knew what the next day would bring . // I 've strived to honestly include the major events that shaped Nic // and our family  --  the good and the appalling . Much of it makes me cringe . I // am horrified by so much of what I did and , equally , what I did not do . Even as // all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't cause it , " I have // not let myself off the hook . I often feel as if I completely failed my son . In // admitting this , I am not looking for sympathy or absolution , but instead // stating a truth that will be recognized by most parents who have been // through this . // Someone who heard my story expressed bafflement that Nic // would become addicted , saying , " But your family does n't seem // dysfunctional . " We are dysfunctional  --  as dysfunctional as every other // family I know . Sometimes more so , sometimes less so . I 'm not sure if I know // any " functional " families , if functional means a family without difficult times // and members who do n't have a full range of problems . Like addicts // themselves , the families of addicts are everything you would expect and // everything you would n't . Addicts come from broken and intact homes . They // are longtime losers and great successes . We often heard in lectures or Al- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charming men and women // who bewilder those around them when they wind up in the gutter . " You 're too // good a man to do this to yourself , " a doctor tells an alcoholic in a Fitzgerald // story . Many , many people who have known Nic well have expressed similar // sentiments . One said , " He is the last person I could imagine this happening // to . Not Nic . He is too solid and too smart . " // I also know that parents have discretionary recall , blocking out // everything that contradicts our carefully edited recollections  --  an // understandable attempt to dodge blame . Conversely , children often fixate on // the indelibly painful memories , because they have made stronger // impressions . I hope that I am not indulging in parental revisionism when I say // that in spite of my divorce from Nic 's mother ; in spite of our draconian long- // distance custody arrangement ; and in spite of all of my shortcomings and // mistakes , much of Nic 's early years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is just being kind . // This rehashing in order to make sense of something that can not // be made sense of is common in the families of addicts , but it 's not all we do . // We deny the severity of our loved one 's problem not because we are naive , // but because we ca n't know . Even for those who , unlike me , never used // drugs , it 's an incontrovertible fact that many  --  more than half of all // children  --  will try them . For some of those , they will have no major negative // impact on their lives . For others , however , the outcome will be catastrophic . // We parents wrack our brains and do everything we can and consult every // expert and sometimes it 's not enough . Only after the fact do we know that // we did n't do enough or what we did do was wrong . Addicts are in denial and // their families are in it with them because often the truth is too inconceivable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denial , however common , is dangerous . I // wish someone had shaken me and said , " Intervene while you can before it 's // too late . " It may not have made a difference , but I do n't know . No one shook // me and said it . Even if they had , I may not have been able to hear them . // Maybe I had to learn the hard way . // Like many in my straits , I became addicted to my child 's addiction . When it // preoccupied me , even at the expense of my responsibilities to my wife and // other children , I justified it . I thought , How can a parent not be consumed by // his child 's life-or-death struggle ? But I learned that my preoccupation with Nic // did n't help him and may have harmed him . Or maybe it was irrelevant to him . // However , it surely harmed the rest of my family  --  and me . Along with this , I // learned another lesson , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without // us . No matter what we do , no matter how we agonize or obsess , we can not // choose for our children whether they live or die . It is a devastating realization , // but also liberating . I finally chose life for myself . I chose the perilous but // essential path that allows me to accept that Nic will decide for himself how  --  // and whether  --  he will live his life . // As I said , I do n't absolve myself , and meanwhile , I still struggle // with how much I can absolve Nic . He is brilliant and wonderful and // charismatic and loving when he 's not using , but like every addict I have ever // heard of , he becomes a stranger when he is , distant and foolish and self- // destructive and broken and dangerous . I have struggled to reconcile these // two people . Whatever the cause  --  a genetic predisposition , the divorce , my // drug history , my overprotectiveness , my failure to protect him , my leniency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these  --  Nic 's addiction seemed to have // had a life of its own . I have tried to reveal how insidiously addiction creeps // into a family and takes over . So many times in the last decade I made // mistakes out of ignorance , hope , or fear . I 've tried to recount them all as and // when they happened , in the hope that readers will recognize a wrong path // before they take it . When they do n't , however , I hope that they may realize // that it is a path they ca n't blame themselves for having taken . // When my child was born , it was impossible to imagine that he would suffer in // the ways that Nic has suffered . Parents want only good things for their // children . I was a typical parent who felt that this could not happen to us  --  // not to my son . But though Nic is unique , he is every child . He could be yours . // Finally , the reader should know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book to obscure the identities of some of the people herein . // I begin when Nic was born . The birth of a child is , for many if not every family , // a transformative event of joy and optimism . It was for us. //
