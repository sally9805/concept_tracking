a novel excerpt <p> It was a long road which he walked , and as it was the end of the dry season it was hot and dusty , and the heat rose from the orange laterite soil in simmered waves . Along the road to Boda there were palm trees and ebony and mango and papaya trees , and sometimes , near a small village , there were orange and grapefruit trees , but mostly it was just thick , green jungle wherein the pygmies hunted for antelope and boar and sometimes the forest elephant . <p> He walked because his motorcycle had broken down again , and this time he could not fix it , and it would not start . He was tired of trying to repair the old Yamaha , and in anger he pushed it in the ditch and removed the leather bag strapped to the seat , and he carried the bag in his right hand and walked , and then in his left hand , and he walked , ever moving toward the village of Boda that was far away but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the small villages that did not have names , he ignored the black children who shouted moonju at him , small children and big children , all with distended stomachs protruding like the drunken bellies of mirth that belied an apparent satiety . He stopped and rested at the side of the road where an old woman sat in the shade of a mango tree before a ten-liter jug of milky palm wine , and he bought a tin cupful for ten francs and drank the bitter juice quickly , wiped his mouth with the back of his hand , and he thanked her before walking on as the naked children watched in his wake . <p> The village of Boda was more than a village but less than a town . It was at a junction two hundred kilometers south of Bangui , the capital of the central African nation , and he walked to Boda now because there was a young African woman there in jail . He had known her in Bangui when she worked as a whore , and he knew the chief of police in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the last government , and now he only wanted to help her out of jail ; he at least owed her that . <p> Her name was Mari . <p> Mari was from Kisangani in Zaire , the Kisangani that was once Stanleyville , and she was a whore and so was her sister , and they were good and kind and pretty , and he once lived with them and the sister 's two children , Roger and Mari . He used to send Roger , who was three years old , to the bar with a thousand-franc note , and Roger would carry the two large bottles of Mocaf beer back to the house where he sat on the shaded veranda listening to the Lingala music of Zaire on the black Phillips portable radio , and little Roger always had the correct change . <p> But he had quit them as he had quit his last job , and now he was working for the United Nations , building schools out of concrete block , the cement coming only in the rainy season when the barges from Brazzaville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide expanse of The Congo that was like a sinewy sea . Now it was the end of the dry season , and there had been no cement for too long , and he had the time and the inclination to go to Boda to help Mari because he had once thought he loved her and that was when he thought it possible to love . <p> His name was Jack Burke , and he was young and American . He had been in the country for three years by then , his first year with the Peace Corps before the Peace Corps pulled out because of Emperor Bokassa 's massacre of several hundred students who had been on strike because they could not afford the school uniforms that the Emperor demanded they buy . When the French Foreign Legion came in with guns and trucks and helicopters , the old government was newly restored , and Jack stayed on because he liked Africa and its lack of obligations . To Jack , Africa was a floating continent apart from the rest of the world , a place in between where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open and there were no walls . It was a place of escape where an unrequited love could be forgotten . A hundred years before him , Africa was a continent to run away to , a land without a past , a land without a future , and , if Jack were lucky , a land without a now . <p> Jack was twenty-five and was tall and strong from basketball and running , and he had come to Africa young and looking for escape and adventure , but now , after only three years , he was much , much older than he should have been . He had heard that for each year one lived in the tropics a year of life was lost , but it was as if he had been in this tropical jungle all his life now : he had seen too much hunger , too much death , and he no longer had the reckless humor that should have been his by right of youth , the humor that had once been his , a humor he had owned and flaunted until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been dashed when he found Karen , with whom he was engaged , to be less than faithful . He had left the States for change , and now a country had changed him . Or was it time that had done this to him ? Physically , he was still tall and handsome with a chiseled chin , black hair always neatly cut above his ears , but his brown eyes had faded , the life of them bleached pale by the heat of the sun . <p> Jack could hear the truck before it was close enough for the driver to see him , and it pulled to a stop next to where he walked . The driver 's helper , who stood on the back bumper of the old Mercedes diesel behind the bed crowded with passengers , asked Jack if he wanted a ride . Dix francs per kilomtre , he said . Jack climbed up , and the women moved over , and the chickens and goats stank , and there was the smell of sweat of the two dozen bodies riding in the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blew his whistle , and the driver put the truck in gear . <p> The truck stopped in every little village between , and passengers climbed off and unloaded boxes and bags , and passengers climbed on and loaded bags and boxes , and the driver was a ladies ' man who spoke to every woman he encountered in the small , thatched adobe villages where chickens pecked the barren earth before the squalid huts of adobe and thatch that lined the road . The driver spoke to these women with a rich , catholic confidence , and the village women who talked to the driver did so in awe because here was a man who traveled and to travel by truck was a magical freedom that could not be readily understood . There was a world down that dusty road beyond the village border , and because these women had not been there , it held all the secret promises that could never be taken away . <p> When the truck drove off from every little village , the naked children would run behind laughing and shouting until they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the swirl of dust scratching at the lice in their matted hair , watching as the truck disappeared in the distance that had no meaning to them because everything they knew was spread from one end of the village to the other ; beyond that was only the trudge to the creek for water , the hike in the forest for firewood , and the trek to the fields to harvest the manioc roots that grew gnarled and twisted like tumors in the hard laterite soil . The road held distance , and in distance were the dreams of every child , and the dreams were as fevered as those of malaria when there was no quinine to rein them in . Something was better out there , and that thing was as amorphous as the clouds that passed freely overhead . Still , whatever it was that was engulfed in distance , it had to be better than the proximity of hunger and disease , the death marked by the nocturnal beating of the funeral drums , a perennial pounding of darkness into night . If the drums were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally died . <p> It was noisy in the back of the truck with the whine of the engine and the squawk of the chickens and the bleat of the goats and the women shouting gossip , and only the men were quiet , eyes closed , huddled with heavy hangovers . The road was rough and potholed , and the driver hit each bump with equanimity and constant speed , and the passengers jarred into each other , and the wheel-well gnawed at Jack 's back . The stench of human sweat and goat urine was strong , and Jack was nauseous as the goats shit pellets in measured intervals . Jack felt locked in , and he could only close his eyes and imagine open space , pretending he was anywhere but where he was ; he thought that if he could imagine time had stopped , he would only be confined in this truck for an instant and that when the truck stopped , time could resume and he would again be free , free to move on his own , to get drunk if he wished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care because he was alone and the Africans would not judge him , especially if he bought them beer . <p> A truck approached from the other direction , and the two drivers honked and refused to move out of the other 's path until the last possible moment of decision when both drivers slightly veered on guard for individual machismo . The trucks came together with only a meter of air between , and then the passengers held handkerchiefs to their noses and mouths because the dust of the road hung suspended for several kilometers , sticking to their sweaty skin , but nobody complained because everyone was traveling to someplace better from someplace worse , places that the village children could not conceive of . Just to be traveling was hope . <p> Only Jack knew better . Hope itself was a falsehood ; hope meant a future , and Jack had had a future planned with Karen , and then Karen had taken it all away . No , hope was a lie . If you had to have hope , Jack thought , you were not now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a dream , like betting you 'd draw to the inside straight , and even if you did , there would always be someone at the table who would flush out . <p> When finally the truck stopped at the market in Boda , everyone climbed out of the bed , even the passengers who were continuing to Carnot where the diamonds were mined . Those who were staying paid the driver 's helper and dragged their cloth bundles from the back of the truck and stacked them on the side of the road above the ditch where the water would rage during the season of rains , and those who were going on stood and stretched their legs , and some of these passengers bought peanuts and mischwee-strips of barbecued beef in a peanut butter sauce-and sodas and beer and palm wine from the vendors of the market who were setting up their stalls again in the angled light of late afternoon after siesta . The light was dark orange as the sun was setting down over the far reaches of jungle , and there was laughter in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This market was like every African market , a vortex of commerce that swirled twice each day with women dressed in blasts of colored saris as they sat before concrete slabs laden with their fruits and vegetables-oranges , papayas , lemons and limes , potatoes , okra , lettuce , and manioc roots that reeked of the cyanide they contained-and eggs and live chickens that squawked in their baskets , and fish and eel and carcasses of wild game-monkey and antelope and snake-and amid this cacophony of commerce barefoot children ran through the crowd singing and laughing and shouting . Wood smoke from the coffee fires and from the metal drums on which the meat was cooked hung languidly in the air , reluctant to rise , and the smells of barbecued goat and boiling coffee mingled in the air with the chatter of gossip that itself was a commodity to be shared . Holding all this in , encircling this activity like a roughly hewn fence , were the Arab stalls , ramshackle huts of cardboard and wood with roofs of corrugated iron under which the Arabs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counters selling cloth by the yard and batteries and flashlights and radios and shirts and pants-anything that was not grown from the hard African ground . <p> Jack stopped at the bar across the street from the market . He ordered beer and sat at a rickety table on the dirt floor and drank the warm beer that tasted bitter of hops but that washed away the dust on the back of his throat . It was early , and the bar was empty . The woman who sat behind the bar did not hide her staring , and Jack ignored her and drank another beer until the sun disappeared over the border far to the west , sinking into the sea that lapped at the shores of Cameroon . <p> The market was in the center of town as the markets always were , and women were making fires to boil coffee for the second time that day as children gathered under the one streetlight in the center of town . There must have been diesel fuel in Boda because the streetlight was on , and children were reading tattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ termites that had been drawn to the light where they now flew as if the light were the source of their food . <p> Jack stopped under the light and asked a boy , O est la mission ? The boy stood , and he was as tall as Jack , and he smiled and said he would take him to the mission . The children giggled , and a girl grabbed a termite out of the air and asked Jack if he were hungry and would he eat it . Jack smiled and took the termite from her hands and put it in his mouth . It fluttered until he bit it in half , and he could taste the acrid juice on his tongue , and he swallowed with sanctimonious pride . The children laughed , and as the tall boy led Jack down a dusty dirt street that had not felt rain in six months , the children continued their gathering of termites , still talking about the funny face the white man had made when he had eaten the termite . <p> At the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill above a coffee plantation overlooking the town of Boda , Jack thanked the boy and offered him some money , but the boy refused it and told him it had been his pleasure to guide him to the mission . Jack stuffed a five-hundred-franc note into the boy 's pants ' pocket and turned and walked up the drive and then up the stairs to the porch of the concrete house that stood like a mansion above the coffee fields that stretched down the hill like green carpets lit now by the white light of the moon . Standing on the porch , Jack could hear the hum of the generator that fueled the yellow light that shined through the opened shutters . <p> A young woman answered the door , and before Jack could speak , she looked him up and down and said in French , " Another young Frenchman who needs a bed ? " <p> " Mais non . Je suis amricain . " <p> " I should have known from your dress , " she replied in English . " But you still need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a Catholic mission at all , but a Baptist mission of Americans , and Jack was disappointed because he did n't like the American Baptists , but it was late and he was tired and he needed a place to stay . The young woman who answered the door had an American Southern accent when she spoke English , and with some knitting in her hands she appraised Jack as he stood in the light from the open door . <p> " Yes . Sorry to bother you . Do you have a place I could stay ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Thank you . " <p> She frowned . " All right , then . Come around the back . " <p> She went back inside and closed the door behind her . Jack walked around the house , and the girl was waiting on the back porch without the knitting , and Jack thought that she was of an indeterminate age between that of a girl and that of a woman , a dubious time when the transition to womanhood could only be marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blue cotton dress and held a kerosene lantern in her hand . Jack thought she looked pretty in the amber light , and he thought she must be the daughter of the missionaries because she was young , and he felt a little sorry for her because he did not like Baptists and at her young age she did not have a choice . <p> Jack followed her to an outbuilding across the dirt yard behind the house . She handed him the lantern and unlocked the door . When she opened it , it was like opening an oven door , the heat wafting out into the relative cool of evening . <p> " There are beds inside . There is a spigot behind the church . " She pointed toward another building across the yard , and Jack could just make it out in the dark . <p> " Thank you . " Jack nodded . <p> " Have you eaten ? " <p> Jack looked at her eyes and could see they were earnest and matter of fact and wide-opened with nothing to hide because there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as sure as she seemed , Jack felt , was due to her youth and religion and maybe , too , because she was in Africa where no one would question her conviction . Maybe it was Africa that had made her so cold , Jack thought , cold to a fellow American , cold because he was not a Baptist as was she . " No , but I do n't want you to go to any trouble . " <p> " You 're hungry but you do n't want to eat with Baptists . " <p> " No , that 's not true . I just do n't want you to go to any trouble . " <p> " Trouble ? We 've had trouble before . " <p> " No , what I meant was- " <p> " I know , and I already have gone to trouble . You interrupted my knitting . Wash up and come up to the house . I 'll fix you something to eat . " Without waiting for an answer , she turned and walked away . <p> Jack thanked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he entered the outbuilding . It had a concrete floor and a corrugated iron roof , and four beds with metal frames were lined up like beds in a barracks , and each had a mosquito net hanging above it . There was a neat pile of sheets and blankets at the foot of each bed . The beds themselves seemed eager for guests , and Jack wondered if this was how the Baptists sucked you in : a warm bed , a hot meal , and then the hand down your throat groping for your soul . Jack set the lantern down next to the black Bible on the table , around which stood four chairs , and he set his bag down at the foot of the bed nearest the door before opening the shutters to the cool evening air . <p> Outside he stripped down to his shorts and splashed water on his body from the spigot , and he soaped up and rinsed again . The water was cool and refreshing after the motorcycle ride and then the walk along the dusty road and then the cramped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water rinsed away those memories , and he felt clean and no longer so tired and dirty . <p> He dressed in clean clothes , blue jeans and a plaid shirt of cotton . Back in the outbuilding , he took out a bottle of White Horse Scotch , and he took a sip because he knew there would be no alcohol in the Baptist mission . That was one of the many reasons , or at least several reasons , he preferred the Catholics . Another reason he liked the Catholics was that they had tricks to wash away guilt as if it were dirt on the skin , the magic of confession like a hot shower after being out in the mud all day long . That , Jack felt , was the best trick of all . <p> He took one more sip of the Scotch , a long one , spilling a little that dripped down his chin and onto his shirt , and the Scotch warmed the back of his throat and the inside of his chest , and he thought it sad that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never know the wonder of the first real drink of the day , especially the magical dash of whiskey . <p> He knocked on the back door , and the young woman appeared wearing an apron embroidered with red apples . She seemed to be as out of place in Central Africa as the apples themselves ; she seemed young and fresh , and Jack wondered if it were religion that preserved her because Africa plucked the youth out of those just born . Looking at her , Jack resented her youth . It was something that did not belong here , not if you were in Africa for long . In Africa , youth was like a flower plucked and placed in a vase of cold water : it would age as quickly as the water warmed . <p> Jack followed her into the kitchen where a young African woman was knitting at the table . She looked up at Jack , and in French Jack said hello , and she returned the greeting before looking back down at her knitting . <p> The young missionary said something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yarn and stood , saying good night before going out the door Jack had come in . <p> " What was she making ? " Jack asked , still standing next to the table as she stood with her back to him ladling stew into a bowl . <p> " Uniforms for the children . " <p> " Uniforms ? " Jack said , sitting down at the table without invitation . <p> " Yes , for our school . That 's what we were doing when you arrived . " She looked down the hall into the living room where her parents sat . " That 's what we do every night , Felicite and I. " <p> He could smell the warmth of food cooking on the gas stove , and it made him hungry . The kitchen was light , and she apologized that the outbuilding was not yet wired , and Jack could hear the generator humming outside . <p> She set a plate of stew before him and sat down across from him . Through the open door and down the hall into the living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman knitting , and he knew they were her parents . He had mixed feelings about their hospitality as they did not come to greet him , but they were Baptists so he did not care . <p> " You 've been drinking , " she said . <p> " Just a sip of Scotch . " <p> " I could smell it when you walked in . " <p> " Sorry . " <p> " If my father knew , he would make you dump it out if you were to stay here . " <p> " Sorry . And you ? " <p> " I do n't care if you drink one way or the other . That 's your business . " <p> Taking a bite , Jack said , " It 's good . " <p> " It 's fresh today . There 's pie , too . " <p> Jack ate and mopped the thick , brown sauce with a piece of white bread with a heavy brown crust , and she watched him eat and offered him more , which he accepted . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the table from him again . In the light of the kitchen , she looked even younger than before , maybe eighteen or nineteen , and had light brown hair cut off at the shoulders , and she was slim . Jack thought she was pretty , but seeing her beauty made Jack feel sorry for her again because she was a Baptist missionary in Africa and he thought she would never have her beauty truly appreciated in love . <p> " I 'm sorry , " Jack said . " I have n't introduced myself . I 'm Jack Burke . " <p> " I 'm Faith . " <p> She reached her hand across the table , and Jack wiped his hands with the napkin before shaking hers . Her wrist was thin , and her hand was delicate , and despite the heat it was cool to the touch , fresh like butter almost . <p> " Faith 's a good name for a missionary , I guess , " Jack said before taking another bite . <p> " Doubt might be better . " She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . " Why do you say that ? " <p> " Forget it . It was just a joke . " <p> Jack looked at her and then resumed eating . He took big spoonfuls of the stew . " Why did you think I was French ? " <p> " What ? " <p> " When I knocked on the door . " <p> " Oh . I do n't know . Our last visitor was French . " <p> " Not a missionary . " <p> She laughed , but it was devoid of mirth . " No , no . He was not a missionary . He was a journalist with Jeune Afrique . " <p> " Doing a story on young American missionaries . " <p> " He could now . " <p> " What ? " <p> " No . A story on deforestation . And what about you ? What are you doing in Boda ? " <p> Jack picked up the tall glass of water and took a long drink and set it down , and the generator hiccupped some bad diesel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I 'm here to help a friend . " <p> " An American ? " <p> " No . An African . " <p> " Is he in some kind of trouble ? " <p> " She . " <p> " She , then . " <p> " Well , it 's a long story , but she 's in jail and it 's really no fault of her own . " <p> " People get into trouble through no fault of their own all the time . " <p> " Well , that 's what happened to her . " <p> Faith stood and went to the refrigerator next to the sink , and Jack could see a faint blue wave of heat emanate from the glass chimney of the refrigerator as the kerosene burned . Faith took out some pie , and Jack thought this was just like being out in eastern Oregon on the ranch where they hunted pheasant and chukar and quail . She set a piece of apple pie before him , and the kitchen was homey and nice , and somehow it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty , was in this kitchen so far away from everywhere where time mattered . It seemed to Jack that not only Faith , but this entire house and family , was in the wrong place . Africa had its own gods , and Jack resented this family for bringing theirs here , for their knitting uniforms the children would have to wear , for their thinking that if you dressed up the children their God would fit in here . <p> After taking a bite , he said , " It 's good . Thanks . " <p> " Where 're you from ? " <p> " You mean in the States ? " <p> " No , here . " <p> " Bangui . " <p> " What do you do ? " <p> " Build schools . With the U.N . " He finished the pie and wiped his mouth with the cloth napkin . He took a drink of water . <p> " You like it ? " Faith had her elbows on the table , her hands clasped , her chin resting on her hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job . " He finished the water and wished he could have a cigarette . <p> " And in the States ? " <p> " Oregon . " <p> " I 'm from Alabama . " <p> " Crimson Tide . Never been down there . How long have you been here ? " <p> She told him that she had been in Boda all her life except for the first two years after she was born , and lack thought it curious that she had the Alabama drawl growing up here in Africa , but she said she went to Alabama every year for two months , where they stayed with her mother 's sister , but that her work and her parents ' work was here in Africa and always had been . <p> " So you like the missionary work , I suppose . " <p> She thought about that for a moment . " Sometimes . I 'd like to travel some , though . " <p> Jack looked through the door down the hall to the living room where her parents sat , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <p> " I imagine it could get pretty boring here . " <p> " No , not at all . " She looked down the hall , then looked back at Jack and smiled . " Well , sometimes . I read a lot , though . The classics , mostly . I read Proust in French . " <p> " I did n't mean anything . I just mean being young and pretty , you probably miss things . " <p> She blushed and reached for his plate and took it to the sink and , with her back to him , ran water over the plate . <p> " You 're not that much older than me , " she said . <p> " Twenty-five . " <p> She washed the dishes and placed them in a rack by the sink , and Jack watched her from behind . <p> " I suppose you 're a Catholic ? " she said . <p> Jack laughed at that , and she turned around and looked at him . <p> " What 's so funny about that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She came back to the table and sat down across from him . She sat straight up , and her posture was perfect like she had taken a lesson on how to sit in a chair . " You mean you 're not any religion ? What were you raised as ? " <p> " A Lutheran . " <p> " And you 're no longer a Lutheran ? " <p> " Not really . " <p> " You would n't have any books I could borrow , would you ? " <p> " No , not with me . " <p> " Oh . I just thought you might . It 's so hard to get good books here . My relatives send them , but they 're not always what I like to read . " <p> " What do you like ? " <p> " I just finished The Guertnantes Way . Proust . In French . The Frenchman , our last visitor , left it for me . Before that I read Remembrances of Things Past . " <p> " When I 'm back in Bangui @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd appreciate that very much . " <p> Jack stood and , pushing the chair back to the table , thanked her for the dinner , turned down her offer of more pie , said good night , and walked out into the dark . She stood in the open doorway and watched him cross the dark yard to the outbuilding , a young silhouette against the outpouring of yellow light behind her . <p> He sat on the porch of the outbuilding and lit a cigarette , and he looked up at the stars and smoked . The funeral drums were beating on the night , a steady hollow sound echoing the darkness , and he thought about just how he could help Mari when he knew she had n't killed the Frenchman in Bangui , but that he had done it and would do it again , but there was no way he was going to go to jail for killing a man who deserved to die , a son of a bitch who had raped both Mari and her sister one night three weeks before , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still feel the push of the knife into the man 's fat belly , he could still hear his guttural cries , he could still feel the sticky warm blood on his hand and wrist and arm as the man struggled . Lying back now on the concrete , blowing smoke at the black sky of night interrupted by a myriad of stars , Jack thought of how he had pulled the knife back out and , in a rage , jabbed him again and again and again and again , until the cries stopped and there was blood all over the concrete floor of Mari 's house , and how Roger and the little girl Mari , named after her aunt , huddled in the corner with their arms around each other , quiet as two terrified children could be . <p> Three weeks later Mari had gone to Carnot on an au casion to visit a Monsieur Duvalier , and when the truck stopped at the barrier before Boda and the passengers got down from the truck to show their papers to the gendarme in the hut by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested . Mari wired her sister , and her sister found Jack and told him of the arrest and how three children found the body of the fat white man with a dozen vents in his chest and belly , found him with the vultures competing for his flesh in the dump at Kilomtre Cinq in Bangui , and Jack thought himself stupid for having disposed of the body there . It had been a mistake , he thought , the last one he would make . <p> He woke up from a dream when it was still dark , and he could not go back to sleep . He heard the call of the roosters , and he rolled over in bed and tried to forget the dream and go back to sleep , but he could do neither . He dreamed that he had been arrested and that the judge was Emperor Bokassa and that Bokassa had laughed at him when Jack said it was in self-defense that he had killed the Frenchman . Then Bokassa stood and shook his ebony cane . <p> No one was up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market square in the darkness of false dawn . The market was still waking up , and Jack sat down on a bench by a fire and had a cup of bitter coffee sweetened by sugared canned milk . He sat there in the cool of the morning , the fire warm on his legs , and he smoked and drank three tin cups of the coffee , and he ate a couple of the greasy doughnuts the old woman sizzled in the yellow palm oil on the fire . The sun rose above the horizon , and the shadows of the palm trees surrounding the market were long and stretched west toward Cameroon . Jack worked on making up his mind on how he had to do what he had to do , and he thought that by now he 'd at least have a plan , but he did n't . He only knew that Mari had not told the police that he had been the killer and that made him smile ; he thought that if he had still been living with her this never would have happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on that Sunday night had gone to see her and he had heard the screams inside , and now there was no going back , but he would have to get Mari out of jail because she had done nothing . She had been raped . <p> He paid for the coffee and the doughnuts and stopped at an Arab stall and bought a pack of Siats , and he lit one and walked to the police station , a white stucco building with tall palm trees growing beside it and a mango tree where children were throwing rocks in an effort to knock down some of the fruit that was n't yet ripe . <p> As Jack walked up the stairs to the porch , the children saw him and stopped their work , and they yelled moonju , white man , and he passed them and went inside . He asked the sergeant if he could speak to the chief , and the sergeant said he was away on business and would not be back for two days . Jack asked if he could visit with the prisoner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Pourquoi ? " <p> " She is a friend . " <p> The sergeant smiled . " Yes , I see . She is a poopalingi . She is beautiful . And young . She can not be eighteen . " He used the Sango word for butterfly , and Jack ignored him , and the sergeant stood and said , " Why not , " and led him through a door and down a hall that was lined with three cells . In the last cell he saw Mari in an orange and black sari sleeping on a cot , and the sergeant unlocked the iron door , and it creaked when he opened it . Jack went in , and the sergeant locked it behind him and said through the bars , " Yell for me when you are done . " <p> Jack sat down on a stool next to the cot and stroked her arm and said , " Mari , c'est moi . Jack , " and she opened her eyes , smiled , and sat up . <p> " Jack . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are wrong to come here . " And then she smiled . " I am fine . They are sending me to Bangui in two days . " She spoke in an admixture of French , Sango , and Lingala , and Jack understood because he had known her for two years and her peculiar syntax had always amused him . <p> " What did you tell them ? " Jack spoke in French . <p> " That he raped me . That I stabbed him with a knife . " <p> " Mari , you 'll go to prison . " <p> " Why ? It was self-defense . " She stretched her arms . <p> " No . Because you 're black . And he was white . " <p> " So ? He raped us . " <p> " I know , I know , but it is France that sends all the money to Bangui , and anyway you know what they will say , what the jury will say . " <p> " That I am a whore ? " <p> " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he looked out at the children throwing rocks at the mangoes , and he kept his back to her . He had n't wanted to say this and was glad she had so he could know for sure that she knew just what was at stake because the jury would ask how a man could rape a whore , and then they would convict her and hang her at Ngaraba Prison because she was just a black African and she had killed a white Frenchman , and Jack now could see her beautiful body swing from a rope , and he was glad he had killed the Frenchman . He would kill him again . <p> Jack turned and looked at her from the window . " Mari , " and Jack 's eyes were on the edge of tears , " there is no one in the world like you . You know that ? No one . I wish the baby had lived . " <p> " I would have named him Jack , and when you were gone back to America I would have had your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the cot and sat down next to her , and he put his arm around her shoulders . <p> " He would have been as handsome as you . " <p> " Mari ... " <p> " But it is too late for that . How is my sister ? " <p> " She is fine , but she is worried . " <p> " And the children ? " <p> " They are fine . " <p> " Good . " <p> " Mari , I know the chief of police here . I met him in Bangui . He 's a friend of Jean-Paul 's , the manager of the San Sylvestre . I will talk to him when he returns in two days . He is a reasonable man . " <p> " Why ? They will send me to Bangui in two days . " <p> " But you did nothing . It was I who killed the man . Dieudonn , he is the chief of police , is a fair man . I will talk to him . I will tell him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him the whole story . " <p> " But you will go to jail . I know you , you can not be in jail even for an hour . You would go crazy . " <p> " No . They will see the truth . They wo n't convict me . " <p> " But before the trial . They will keep you locked up like me . " <p> " No . That is why I am waiting for the chief of police . He will understand that I am not guilty and that I will not run . I will cooperate and go to Bangui , and they wo n't keep me in jail . " <p> " Are you sure ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> She smiled . " Thank you . " <p> " There is nothing to thank me for . It is I who should be thanking you . Can you manage here two more days ? " <p> " Of course . " <p> " I will bring you some food . " <p> Jack called for the sergeant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sergeant winked at Jack and said , " Was she good ? " <p> Jack ignored him and told him he would be back with food . <p> In the market , Jack bought two saris from an Arab , and then he bought mongbelli and mischwee and orange soda and the sugared peanuts that Mari liked so much , and after having delivered this to Mari he went to a bar , and he drank warm beer because there was none cold , and he thought of the miscarriage and how he had left Mari because he had thought that she had aborted the child ; he had been angry and struck her , and he had packed his things and moved out , and a week later her sister , Franoise , had come to him to tell him that he was mistaken , but he had not wanted to believe her because it was easier this way . But three months later on that Sunday night just three weeks ago he had gone to her house to apologize , and he had heard her screams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frenchman astride her , his fat white ass in the air , and the children in the corner and Franoise unconscious on the floor of her room . With a fistful of hair he pulled the man off her from behind , and he threw him to the floor and took his Buck knife from the sheath on his belt and opened the knife , and the man sat up and pushed himself backwards to the wall . Jack walked toward him in the lantern light , and Mari had screamed no , but Jack walked to the man slowly and with measured steps , the knife tight in his hand , and he kicked the man in the face , and it was the first noise he made when he screamed from the brunt of the steel-toed Red Wing boot hard against his nose . He stood up with his hands on his face , blood seeping through his fingers , and he slid toward the door with his back against the wall , and Jack lunged at him and stuck the knife in his belly , and the knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the man fell down , Jack bent down with him still holding the knife , and when the man was lying down groaning with blood spreading across his shirt , the only garment he wore , Jack pulled out the knife and jabbed it into the man again , and again and again and again , hard steel into the soft flesh of the man , no end to the blood that was sticky and warm , and now , sitting in the bar , he swore to himself that he would do it again and he did not have a single regret except that he wished the man could have lived longer to die more slowly with more pain . <p> He ate lunch at the bar-manioc leaves sauted in a peanut butter sauce with small chunks of river snake , and mongbelli , long sticks of boiled manioc root-and then he drank more beer , and the sun was hot when he finally walked back to the mission . He took a siesta , and he dreamed of Mari , and the dream was strange as all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a baby buggy and Jack pushed it along a dusty road in Oregon and Mari was no baby . <p> When he had first come to Africa , and before he had met Mari on the veranda of the New Palace Bar , he had dreamed of Karen , whom he had met his freshman year in college . He dreamed of her and of how in love they were , and he dreamed they were married and that they celebrated communion together , both on their knees , the Eucharist , and then he dreamed that he killed her by slitting her throat and he caught her blood in a chalice , but he did n't dream of her anymore after he had met Mari . <p> When he awoke he was sweating . He pulled back the mosquito net and opened the shutters and went out and washed at the spigot . It was late afternoon , and the sun was at an angle , and the outside was now orange instead of white light . <p> He sat on the concrete porch of the outbuilding in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fruit . He was smoking a cigarette when Faith came down from the house in jeans and a western shirt as if she were a cowgirl , and she carried two bottles of orange soda . She sat down next to him and handed him a bottle . <p> " How is your friend ? " <p> " Okay . You want a cigarette ? " <p> She frowned . " No , I do n't smoke . " <p> He smiled . " Of course not . But you do n't mind one way or the other if I do ? " <p> She caught herself smiling at his mimicry , and she frowned again at her own betrayal . " No , not one way or another . That 's your business . " <p> He laughed . <p> " What 's so funny ? " <p> " Nothing . It 's just that you said the same thing about drinking , that it was my business . " <p> He sat with his back against the wall of the outbuilding , his legs stretched out before him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette on the porch and tossed the butt into the dirt at the foot of the stairs , and she watched it fall onto the ground . He took a sip of the soda , and it was cold and tasted good to him because his tongue was dry from the alcohol he had drunk that morning and afternoon . She took a drink of her own . <p> " Why is your friend in jail ? " <p> " Because the police think she killed a man who raped her . " <p> " And she did n't ? " <p> " No . " Jack stared out at the empty yard . <p> " How can you be so sure ? " And then : " Anyway , he would deserve it . " <p> Jack turned and looked at her now and into her blue eyes that were big and clear , and he could see her youth and how fresh she was and clean , a girl who was nave and who believed in the goodness of mankind maybe , and for a moment he wished he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she seemed , pure and clear as cold water from a spring . Her skin was smooth and clean , and when she smiled he saw her teeth gleam , and he felt her life could not possibly be real for there was no sign of hardship on her body , no wrinkles , no scars , and even her voice was like clear water . She was smooth like a new candle that had never been burned . <p> " I just know , that 's all . " <p> " What will they do ? " <p> " They 're sending her to Bangui in two days . " <p> " And then you 'll go to Bangui ? " <p> " Yes . If you do n't mind me staying here . " <p> " Of course not . People stay here all the time . " <p> " Like the French journalist you mentioned . " <p> " Yes . We have lots of visitors . " <p> " Why did you say he could write a story about you now ? " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " Because he stayed here with us . That 's why . And if he stayed with pygmies , he could write about them . " <p> " I see . " <p> " I enjoy visitors . More than my parents do . " She looked to the house , and Jack followed her gaze . <p> " Your parents do n't ? " <p> " It depends on who they are . Some they do n't like at all . It 's just that they do n't want me unduly influenced . " She looked down at her hands cradled in her lap . <p> " Unduly ? " <p> " My father 's expression . Inappropriately influenced . " <p> " And what would be the appropriate form of influence ? " <p> " The Bible , of course . " <p> " Not the other books you read , then ? " <p> She blushed . " What books ? " <p> " Last night you said you were n't bored . That you read a lot of books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> She took a sip of soda and smiled . " Not all of them . No , certainly not . " <p> " When I was in college , a prof had us read Henry Miller . Ever read him ? " <p> " Of course not . " <p> " But you know about him ? " <p> " Yes . I told you I read . Just because I 've grown up here in the middle of Africa does n't mean I do n't have an education . " She paused . " I read Madame Bovary in French when I was fifteen . " <p> " How old are you ? " <p> " Seventeen . " She sat up straighter than she had been sitting before . " Almost eighteen . " <p> " You 're old enough to do what you want . " <p> " I do . " <p> " So you choose to stay here ? " <p> " For the time being . " <p> " Then what ? " <p> " Travel , I think . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Italy and Spain , and I 'd like to go to Australia . " Her eyes took on a dreamy quality , and Jack smiled . <p> " Why Australia ? " <p> " You 'll laugh . " <p> " No I wo n't . " <p> " Promise ? " <p> " Sure . I promise . " Jack held out his right hand , and she shook it . <p> " I want to see the kangaroos , " she said . <p> Jack laughed , and she gave him a hard look . <p> " Faith , " a woman 's voice called from the porch of the house , and both Jack and Faith looked up to see her mother standing there , a tall , pretty woman whose long , gray hair was tied back in a ponytail . She had a towel in her hand . Her face was soft , and her eyes were kind , and she looked down at Faith with a maternal patience that even Jack could sense ; it was as though she were looking down at herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something she no longer had and would never have again , yet this longing , this nostalgia , was so tangible that Jack felt the two , mother and daughter , were , for that brief moment when time had stopped , united as one . <p> " Yes ? " Faith stood . <p> " Come and help with dinner , please . " <p> " Yes , Mother . " Faith stood and looked at Jack , who was lighting another cigarette . " I 'll call you when dinner 's ready . " She walked up to the house , and Jack watched her , thinking about what type of woman would travel all the way to Australia to see a kangaroo . But then he had come thousands of miles just to see another continent , and that , he thought , was not really any different than her desire to go so far away . <p> The sun slipped beyond the trees , and their shadows stretched long toward evening . The funeral drums began their nocturnal lament , and Jack leaned against the concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms out and sighed , and then stood and went into the dark room and took a long swallow of Scotch from the half-empty bottle , setting it back on the table next to the Bible . <p> Author Affiliation
