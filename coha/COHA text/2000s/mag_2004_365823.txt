Eliot Spitzer received an anonymous letter last March that made for intriguing reading . The message suggested that the New York attorney general poke around Marsh &; McLennan , the U.S. 's largest insurance broker and a firm Spitzer had tangled with in earlier financial- industry investigations . This time Spitzer asked Marsh about its practice of receiving " contingent commissions " from insurance companies , a controversial type of payment . That 's when things started to get nasty . Spitzer says the more he probed , the more Marsh misled and " fed us the same foolishness they 've been feeding the public over the years . " He felt that Marsh CEO Jeffrey Greenberg , son of Maurice ( Hank ) Greenberg , the legendary boss of insurance giant American International Group ( AIG ) , was stonewalling him . " I did n't see in their management a desire for reform , " Spitzer says . <P> Marsh is paying dearly for not playing nice with Spitzer , whose anticorruption crusades in recent years have targeted top executives at Wall Street investment banks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exchange ( N.Y.S.E. ) . In a civil suit filed in New York state court last week , Spitzer charged Marsh with a price-fixing and kickback scheme that inflated the cost of insurance for clients ranging from the Greenville County School District in South Carolina to companies like Fortune Brands . According to Spitzer , roughly $800 million of the $1.5 billion in net income Marsh earned last year came from those dicey commissions . The complaint says Marsh would sometimes promise business to one insurer but insist a competitor provide an inflated bid to create an illusion of competition  --  even demanding a " live body " at presentations to prospective clients . <P> Marsh , whose stock sank 24% on the news , said it has been cooperating with Spitzer since spring but had not been made aware of the charges until last week , when it agreed to stop taking the payments and replaced the head of the business unit involved in the allegations . In a statement , Marsh said it was " committed to getting all the facts , determining any incidence of improper behavior , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company 's independent directors expressed confidence in the firm 's leadership . Marsh declined to comment further to TIME . But the attorney general is n't in a forgiving mood . " I wo n't settle and leave in place a CEO whose behavior has been unhelpful , distortive and unresponsive , " Spitzer told TIME . <P> Is the attorney general really trying to get Marsh 's CEO fired ? It would n't be his first use of prosecutorial leverage to push for dramatic change . When he went after the mutual-fund industry for late- trading violations , he used the opportunity to force funds to lower their fees , which critics decried as overreaching but investor-rights advocates praised . He 's now locked in a legal battle with former N.Y.S.E . chief Richard Grasso , trying to force him to return millions of dollars in compensation .
