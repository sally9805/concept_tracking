<p> OMAHA  --  Who knew there would come a time when thousands of people would stand in line to give Scrooge a hug ? <p> But that 's exactly what 's happening in the lobby of the Omaha Community Playhouse . <p> As Christmas trees glow and snow falls outside the playhouse 's massive windows , night after night Dick Boyd stands in a receiving line as people wait to shake his hand , get his autograph and , yes , give him a hug . Most have never met him , but they know exactly who he is : their Scrooge . <p> " We love you , we love you , we love you ! " says Joan Lien , a mother of three who is literally jumping up and down in front of him . <p> Boyd , while gracious to a fault , has the look of a man who wonders when this will all end . The answer is soon . <p> Boyd retires Dec. 22 after playing Scrooge in the popular production of Charles Dickens ' A Christmas Carol for 30 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never missed a night . This sold-out season is no exception . <p> And while A Christmas Carol is being staged at hundreds of community theaters across America , the production here at the nation 's largest community theater ( in attendance , staff size and budget ) has become legendary . And Boyd 's Scrooge is its star of stars . <p> Indeed , going to see Boyd as Scrooge has become a Christmas tradition here in the heart of the Midwest . <p> His face has appeared on everything from billboards at bus stops to grocery bags at Baker 's Supermarkets . He has become so ubiquitous , he ca n't go anywhere without being recognized . <p> " Hey , Scrooge ! " people still yell , he says , " from Kansas City to Estes Park , Colo . " <p> Says Carl Beck , the theater 's artistic director , " Dick is probably the playhouse 's greatest ambassador . He 's the most recognized face in Omaha . You could n't escape him if you wanted to .

Boyd admits this last season has been " very sentimental . " <p> Lucky for him he no longer wears any makeup . " It really is n't necessary anymore , " he says . <p> Adds Tim Schmad , the playhouse 's executive director , " His age is his makeup now . " <p> So dedicated is Boyd to his non-paying role that his wife , Miriam , finally gave in and joined the production 17 years ago in order to see her husband from October to Christmas . " I just got tired of being home alone , " she says . <p> She knew better than anyone that the man she married 55 years ago was n't a quitter . <p> Not that Boyd really knew what he had signed up for three decades ago . In fact , he did n't think he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and too skinny , he thought . <p> So did everyone else except the late Charles Jones , the theater 's legendary executive director . <p> " I remember being very uncertain about it at the time , " Boyd says . " But I trusted Charles ' judgment . I told him I hope he knew what he was doing . " Seems he did . <p> Jones ' widow , Eleanor , another force at the playhouse who gave a tribute to Boyd on his 800th performance two weeks ago , knows Scrooge 's shoes are going to be very hard to fill . <p> " It 's just that Dick is different , " she says . " He brings an earth warmth to the role . Charles always said Dick was the one who best captured the joy of redemption . " <p> Offstage , Boyd is about as far from Scrooge as one can get . Shy and self-deprecating , he 's earnest in the way one would suspect someone born in nearby Nebraska City 83 years ago might be . His wife calls him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher , father of four , grandfather of 11 and great-grandfather of one , Boyd is often described by other players as " a sweetheart . " <p> Marianne Young , in her 28th season as Mrs. Cratchit and " on my eighth husband , " is one of them . <p> " Dick is the Scrooge you see at the end of the show . A very generous man . There 's not an ounce of ego there . " <p> Joanne Cady , who did the original choreography for the production , was among the first to see Boyd 's magic . She was there when he was chosen 30 years ago . <p> " You would n't have been surprised if you sat through all those auditions , " she says . " In fact , I was n't surprised at anything Charles did . " <p> The show has continued , despite initial plans for a run of just a season or two . <p> " It caught on , and we just kept going , " Boyd says . " My personal boast at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " <p> He took the challenge seriously . <p> " You just want to be sure when you start out that you can finish . This is unlike professional theater . We do n't have understudies . " <p> He thinks now is a good time to take his final bow : " I 'd like to go out when I 'm still on top and not pass out in the middle of a production . " <p> The amateur singer and actor met his wife at Midland Lutheran College in Fremont . " We sang together , and we stayed singing , " Boyd says . <p> He has performed in a number of playhouse productions , but Scrooge became his signature role . <p> He thinks his Scrooge worked all these years because he loves the story and the role . " You ca n't act it . You have to be it . " <p> Steve Priesman has seen this firsthand . He 's in his 19th year as stage manager for A Christmas Carol . " There have been nights I know he 's not felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's not acting . It 's who he is for two hours . " <p> Al DiMauro played Jacob Marley for 20 years , retiring three years ago . As the years passed , he and Boyd would change the blocking every now and then to accommodate their aging bodies . Tiny Tim , for instance , does n't make it up to Scrooge 's shoulder any longer . <p> " And it worked better , " DiMauro says . " I just feel sorry for the person who takes over . They 'll just have to be ready for the comparisons . But the show will survive . " <p> Boyd shares a dressing room with long-suffering Marley , who is played by Don Harris , and the Ghost of Christmas Present , played by Bob Snipp , who also is retiring this year after 29 years . <p> " I might have stopped earlier , but I thought if Dick was going on , I 'd go on , too , and I 'd go out with him , too , " says Snipp , a chemistry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more than just three decades on the stage together . They both go home every night and shake glitter out of their shoes  --  glitter the two throw around when Scrooge begins coming to life on stage . <p> " Oh , in the middle of summer , I still find it in the carpet , " Snipp says . <p> They , too , agree the show will go on quite nicely without them . <p> Set designer Jim Othuse is even refurbishing the set after this year . " I do n't want to mess with it too much . Just spruce it up a bit . We 're looking at the next 30 years , I guess . " <p> Back in the receiving line , Boyd is finding even his former students are coming to see him as he exits this stage of his life . <p> " This is my first time seeing him , and he was wonderful , " says Pam Price , a legal assistant who was Boyd 's student in 1976 at Kirn Junior High in Council Bluffs , Iowa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Also in line was Linda Hitzemann , an Omaha homemaker who was there with her husband , Kevin , and two young sons , Jack and Joe . She has been to the production a half-dozen times over 30 years . <p> " My sister and I were talking just the other day about what a tradition it is . It 's magic to come here and see him . He 's just part of the holidays . It wo n't be the same without him . "
