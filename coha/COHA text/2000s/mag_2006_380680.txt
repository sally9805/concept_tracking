Smiling broadly and looking dapper in a powder blue shirt , pin-striped suit and bright red tie , Renault CEO Carlos Ghosn does n't look like your typical corporate hatchet man . Back in 1999 , however , Ghosn was dubbed the " samurai " and " cost killer " at Nissan Motor in Japan . As the newly appointed president , he began closing plants , slashing more than $20 billion in debt and eliminating 20,000-plus jobs to return the moribund company to profitability . Many observers  --  especially France 's sometimes intractable unions  --  expected similar tough love in early February , when Ghosn unveiled his ambitious four-year plan for the European auto giant , which has had an increasingly close joint partnership with Nissan since 1999 . But , quelle surprise , so far Ghosn 's quality-enhancing , production-boosting , profit-focused project has avoided layoffs . " Renault is not in the same critical situation Nissan was , so the methods we 're using to improve things are different , " says Ghosn during an interview at Renault 's Boulogne-Billancourt headquarters on the southwestern edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be successful . But if not , we 'll assume the consequences . Everyone knows exactly what 's at stake . " <P> In the auto industry in particular  --  still the bellwether for a globally successful manufacturing sector in many European countries  --  managers have had to make tough choices that have proved politically controversial . In Europe , unions still have considerable political power , not to mention seats at the board of directors table . DaimlerChrysler has said it is looking for a reduction of 14,500 jobs at Mercedes , while Volkswagen in February announced 20,000 job cuts . In such an environment , Renault appears to be defying gravity by promising ambitious results without the pain of slashing labor costs . Indeed , Ghosn is pledging to increase annual car sales by 800,000 units by 2009 , double operating profit margins and improve product and brand quality . " The lesson of the Nissan revival plan was , What 's vital is the result , not the precise means of attaining it , " says Ghosn , 52 . " We 've analyzed the opportunities and potentials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll deliver . " The end result , he predicts , will be the " most profitable European volume car company . " <P> Ironically , that will mean shifting away from the European market . Renault , founded in 1898 and beloved by the French for its innovative designs and reliable cars , remains profitable with a 2005 net income of $5.39 billion , making it the third largest car manufacturer in Europe . But when Ghosn was named CEO last April , he inherited slowing European car markets , dated production and management systems and some dud car models such as the Vel Satis luxury car . With Renault sales in Western Europe dropping 7.3% in the second half of 2005 , group operating profit margin shrank from 5.2% to 3.2% . Ghosn was forced to issue profit warnings for 2006 and indicated that 2007 would be slow too .
