1 Skylar : Out , Out , Damned Spotlight Convocation was supposed to start at noon , and because the chapel did n't have air-conditioning and the gym was , well , a gym , the ceremony was set up on the grass out in Hamilton Quad with a makeshift stage and lots of white folding chairs . But I was n't sitting in the folding chairs with the rest of my classmates and their pastel-clad parents . I was on the stage , vainly trying to keep everyone in the front row from getting a free peep show of my panties ( okay , thong ) , and wishing I 'd worn a longer skirt . I was the senior honoree , which was supposedly a Very Big Deal because it meant I was ranked first in the incoming senior class and was getting tapped as the most likely candidate for valedictorian . Senior honoree was always a boy . Always . Actually , the first-ranked boy in my class was Charley Morton , and I would have totally let him sit on the stage and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , like , a certificate Woo . Hilliard Preparatory School could n't have come up with something useful , like a gift card to Barnes &; Noble ? Or a Prada bag ? I glanced at the girl who was sitting on my left , this junior I 'd never spoken to in my life , and said , " What do you think 's the holdup ? This ceremony is taking longer than a download of Janice Weiner 's blog . " Random fact : Janice Weiner ( presumably drunk atthe time ) had posted half a dozen " lingerie model " pics of herself on her blog over spring break of our junior year . Someone saw them in her blog and sent the link as a mass e-mail to everyone with an @Hilliard.edu e-mail account . Scandal . The girl I 'd spoken to did n't say anything , so I sat there staring at my watch for the next three minutes until the first curl of music drifted through the quad . Some assholes , the same reckless upperclassmen who thought it was terrifically witty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in approval . The marching band , in their stiff white uniforms , traveled slowly forward as they blared the school song sans words . As the band played , the door to Lerner Hall opened and the faculty who were staying on for summer session poured out in their ceremonial robes and hoods , which were probably still dirty from commencement two weeks ago . Mr. Bloom 's robe definitely had a stain on the right shoulder . Someone should give that man a bar of soap and a squirt bottle of Febreze , then explain the difference . Everyone 's parents shifted in their seats so they could see the colors on each teacher 's hood and determine whether or not they approved of the degree and major . Most of the students watched the faculty procession for a different reason : to see which teachers were n't doing summer session , and to see which teachers were new . As if the information was n't on the school Web site or in the crinkled programs on their laps . As Headmaster Bell welcomed the " esteemed guests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first day of summer session , I totally could n't focus . It was so hot out , and everyone was staring at the stage , which meant that Contention 1 : They were staring in my general direction , so Subpoint A : Chances were some of them were staring at me , Subpoint B : They could see up my skirt , and Subpoint C : They knew I was senior honoree . Well , screw it . Why should n't they know ? I mean , I 'd freaked when I found out about it , because I had n't been trying to beat out Charley Morton or anything . It just happened . Like the whole eighties revival thing . One day I was invisible , totally under the class rank radar and off everyone 's secret hit lists of who they were going to blame if they did n't get into Princeton early decision . Then my mom got the letter in the mail . She almost did n't find it . We get a whole tub of mail a day , which the postman absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're always getting manuscripts sent to the house . Tucked underneath a batch of query letters was an envelope with the Hilliard school crest . Basically I was screwed . Everyone who put two and two together and got 4.0 today would realize that I had beat them out . Me . The girl who 'd supposedly calculated the exact obtuse angle to which she spread her legs ( more about that scandal later ) . Suddenly I would be their biggest threat . It was laughable -- like Hilary Duff going to Harvard . Oh , wait . That actually happened . Finally Headmaster Bell ended his long-winded **44;0;TOOLONG spiel and invited the quiet junior girl to sing the national anthem . Polite clapping . She minced up to the lectern and planted her scuffed black flats with the toes against the wood , ruining them even more . Everyone stood up and placed their hand over their heart . The same boys who had hooted earlier made whooping yells after she sang the words " land of the free , " and I rolled my eyes . God . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those show-offy voice curls that the girls who never win on American Idol do , the girl sat down and an a cappella quartet led us in singing the school song , which I mouthed absently , a knot of nervousness in my stomach . Bell took the lectern again . He had something in his hand . A certificate ? But this was n't the regular convocation , just a summer session one ! I tried to pay attention , but the heat was making my eyeliner smear , and my ass cheeks had formed covalent bonds with the chair . I wondered if my lack of focus meant I was going crazy , or if it was just too hot to concentrate . Mental parliamentary debate number one : Skylar Banks is going crazy -- discuss . Prime minister : She can not concentrate . Therefore , she is crazy . Leader of the opposition : She is stressed out and being stared at , so the lack of concentration is due to nerves . " This student served as the copy editor of the Hilliard Howler . She is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year 's Policy Debate state semifinalist . This year 's senior honoree , from Tarrytown , New York , Skylar Banks . " I stood up and yanked my skirt down over my ass , then tottered over to the lectern on my mint green Miu Miu espadrilles and shook Bell 's hand . People clapped , but that still did n't drown out the sounds of half the student body whispering furiously -- about me . I caught a glimpse of my parents in the front near Alison Forsyth . I privately thought she was the highlight of the ceremony , because I 'd heard her complain earlier , " Omigod , I 'm so bored I could shoot myself in the head with a knife .
