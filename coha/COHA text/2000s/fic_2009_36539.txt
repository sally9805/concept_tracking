It began , as so many of life 's critical events do , with a phone call . One moment you 're working or reading or sleeping or shopping , blissfully unaware that your whole existence is about to be altered ; the next , some disembodied voice plunges your ordered world into chaos . <p> <p> Wednesday afternoons are generally quiet at the office of Simpson &amp; Tanner , Inquiry Agents . We occupy a small space in a one-story building just outside the gates of Indigo Run Plantation , about halfway down Hilton Head Island . It was unusually warm , even for March . In the Lowcountry of South Carolina , winter is generally confined to a few cold days at the beginning of the year , and spring bursts through with the azaleas , often in late February . <p> <p> My partner , Erik Whiteside , worked on his laptop at the reception desk just outside my door . We 'd been busy for the past couple of months steadily processing job applications and volunteer statements for the is-land 's recreation board and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become routine , even for me . Computers and I coexist , but there 's no love lost on either side . Except for the fact that he 's tall and blond and handsome , Erik could rightly be classified as a geek , and he 'd taught me well . <p> <p> I 'd just finished running the final name on my list through the series of databases we 'd subscribed to . I clicked on the icon to print out the report and leaned back in my chair . I stretched and tried to work the kinks out of my neck . Absently , I massaged the ache that had settled in my right thigh . The damage caused by the attack had healed well , with only a minor scar , and physical therapy had me nearly back to normal . I 'd even begun jogging on the beach again , taking it easy until I built the muscle back to full strength . But when I sat too long in one position , it still tended to cramp up on me . <p> <p> I stood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rang . I reached for the receiver , but Erik beat me to it . I paused , left hand extended , and studied my mangled ring finger . <p> <p> This other remnant of that horrifying night had not fared so well . The jagged scar still throbbed when I let my hands dangle at my sides , and the nail had grown back in crookedly . Still , it could have been worse . The tenderness would fade , or so the doctor assured me . The swelling had taken a long time to go down , and it now resembled my other fingers more than it did a Vienna sausage . <p> <p> In a few more days , I 'd have no viable excuse for not putting on Red 's engagement ring . <p> <p> " Bay ? " <p> <p> " Yes ? " I stepped around the desk and into the doorway of my office . <p> <p> " It 's Lavinia , " he said . " She sounds kind of strange . " <p> <p> I whirled back and snatched up the receiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old antebellum mansion on St. Helena Island since before I was born . Through the chaos of my childhood , her steady hand and loving heart had been the rocks to which I 'd clung . In the past years , her care of my aging and crippled father had enabled me to live my life free of this burden and responsibility . I owed her a great deal . <p> <p> " What 's the matter ? " I snapped into the phone . <p> <p> " Nothing to get excited about , " she said calmly . " Your father 's been feelin ' poorly today , and I 'm taking him in to see Dr. Coffin . " <p> <p> I frowned . " Why is n't Harley coming to the house ? " <p> <p> Her pause set off tiny alarm bells in the back of my head . " He wants to run a couple of tests . " Again she hesitated . " At the hospital . " <p> <p> " Tell me the truth , Lavinia . Are they admitting him ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the worst in everything . If it was somethin ' more , I 'd tell you , would n't I ? " <p> <p> I was n't so sure about that . Lavinia had been protecting me  --  and my family  --  for as long as I could remember . <p> <p> " Maybe , " I said . " Should I meet you there ? " <p> <p> " No need , child . We 'll be back in a couple of hours . I just did n't want you to worry if you called and we were n't here . " <p> <p> I glanced up as the outer door opened , and a striking black woman in a sharply tailored gray suit stepped tentatively through the door . Erik rose to greet her , and I snapped my attention back to the phone . <p> <p> " You 'll call me ? As soon as you get home ? " <p> <p> " Of course . Now I have to go . " I could almost see the softening of the stern expression on her wrinkled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll take care of things . " <p> <p> " Yes , ma'am , " I said automatically before I realized she 'd already hung up . <p> <p> I replaced the receiver gently in the cradle . My stomach felt as if I 'd been plunged suddenly to earth from a great height , like one of those drop-of-terror rides at Six Flags . <p> <p> Retired judge Talbot Simpson had celebrated his eightieth birthday in January . Lavinia and I had thrown him a massive party , inviting all his former courthouse cronies , the remnants of his Thursday night poker gang , and his old hunting buddies . Truth to tell , there were n't all that many of them left , but those who were physically able showed up . There was a lot of talk of the old days  --  trials won and lost , doves and ducks blasted out of the sky , scandals and rumors of scandals , and **30;190;TOOLONG reminiscing . For once , Lavinia let the bourbon flow unchecked and did n't even force the cigar smokers out onto the verandah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge had enjoyed himself immensely . <p> <p> " Good to see everybody , " he 'd said when the last guest had shuffled down the steps . " Better than having them all standin ' around gawking at me in my coffin . " <p> <p> I remembered I 'd laughed at that . " I promise I wo n't let anyone gawk , " I 'd said . <p> <p> " Good , " my father had replied , not sharing the joke . " Just see you stick to that when the time comes . " <p> <p> A chill like the bitterest winter wind off the ocean shook me , and I sank back into my chair . A moment later , Erik stepped in and pulled the door closed behind him . <p> <p> " Is the Judge okay ? " he asked . <p> <p> " Just some tests , " I said , trying to force circulation back into my face . I knew my attempt at a smile must have looked more like a grimace . <p> <p> " Lavinia will take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> <p> " He 's my father , " I snapped , then deliberately relaxed my shoulders . " Sorry . Who 's the woman ? " <p> <p> " Potential client , " he answered . <p> <p> " Any idea what her problem is ? " <p> <p> " Nope . She wants to talk to you . " <p> <p> I ran a hand through the tangle of my reddish-brown hair and sucked in a long breath . " Give me a couple of minutes and send her in . " <p> <p> " Right , " he said and closed the door after himself . <p> <p> I stood again and pulled the black blazer off the back of my chair . I was plenty warm in the white silk turtleneck , but I felt more professional with the jacket on . I straightened my desk , retrieved a clean legal pad from the right-hand drawer , and made certain the small recorder had a fresh tape . I smiled a little , remembering Erik 's disdain for the antiquated technology , but it worked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd figure out how to use a BlackBerry . <p> <p> My hands were folded demurely in front of me on the desk when the door opened . <p> <p> " Bay , this is Joline Eastman . Please have a seat , ma'am . " <p> <p> " Thank you . " <p> <p> The slim black woman perched on the edge of the client chair and smiled briefly over her shoulder as Erik retreated . She did n't offer her hand , so I kept mine to myself . <p> <p> " I 'm pleased to meet you , Ms. Eastman . " <p> <p> " It 's Mrs. " Her thin smile did n't reach her deep brown eyes . <p> <p> " How can we help you , Mrs. Eastman ? " <p> <p> She pulled a manila folder from a black leather briefcase and extracted a single paper and what looked to be an old photograph . She hesitated a few seconds , appearing reluctant to relinquish possession of the documents , then laid them faceup in front of me . <p> <p> It looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from a computer program designed to keep track of the family tree . Lines and boxes spread out across the page . Without studying it too closely , I could see some prominent blank spaces . <p> <p> The picture was indeed old , mounted on stiff cardboard and with that grainy , blurred finish so prevalent in early-twentieth-century photographs . It was a black family  --  parents and three children  --  and what were probably one set of grandparents as well , dressed in their best . The women 's frilly , high-necked blouses and jaunty hats perched on upswept hair made me guess 1920s . The photo had been taken outdoors , and the backdrop looked to be some kind of store or business . <p> <p> " Your family ? " I asked and looked up to see Mrs. Eastman with another picture clutched tightly in her slim fingers . Unconsciously , she rubbed her thumb back and forth across its surface . <p> <p> " Yes . Mine . My grandfather is the young man . I think . " She paused a moment to clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly black eyes . " I ca n't say for certain . " <p> <p> " They look like nice people . " <p> <p> Her expression changed again , and anger replaced the misery I thought I 'd detected just a few seconds before . " I would n't know . That photo and these old letters are all I have to go on . " She laid a bundle of envelopes on the desk beside the genealogical chart . <p> <p> I had no idea where this was going , but I could sense some deep emotion barely held in check . I gave her time to gather herself by flipping the picture over to study the faded photographer 's imprint . Hard to read , but I thought it might have said Charleston . Someone had written the date , 1919 , in the upper right-hand corner , in pencil . <p> <p> " I 'm sorry . " It sounded lame , even to me , but I could n't think of what else to say . <p> <p> " I want you to find them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's left of it . " Suddenly she rose and laid the second photo on my desk . In color , it showed a gangly teenaged girl with light brown skin and braided black hair dressed in tennis whites , the racket held in front of her as if she were preparing to return serve . " If you ca n't , " she said in a quavering voice , " my daughter is going to die . " <p> <p> Excerpted from Covenant Hall by Kathryn R. Wall . Copyright 2009 by Kathryn R. Wall .
