<p> Lewis Wolff , a hotel real estate magnate , led a team of investors that purchased the Oakland Athletics in April for $180 million from owners Steve Schott and Ken Hofmann . <p> Wolff , the managing general partner of the team , handles the day-to-day financial operations of the A 's , but it was John Fisher , son of Gap founder Donald Fisher , who put up most of the money to buy the team . <p> One of Wolff 's first moves was to sign President Michael Crowley and General Manager Billy Beane to long-term contracts . <p> Just four months into his new job , he announced tentative plans to leave McAfee Coliseum and build a new ballpark , set in an urban village just north of the existing site . The plans for a $300 million ballpark were later scrapped after Wolff encountered dozens of landowners who were not prepared to sell their parcels . <p> Wolff said the team will close off the third deck in the Coliseum this season and will limit the capacity to about 35,000 people . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballpark in Oakland or the East Bay and a way to finance the project . He recently spoke to The Chronicle about his ballpark plans and the challenges that continue to face the team . The following has been edited for space and clarity . <p> Q : Some questions have been raised about the location of a new stadium . What 's the real situation now ? <p> A : As I see it today , the real situation is not too different from when we started . There has n't been much of a change in our ideas in how we might implement a facility . Our biggest problem is a site , first of all . Our goal is to try and stay , though it 's becoming difficult , in the city of Oakland , if not in the county of Alameda . <p> Our focus has been pretty much in the East Bay . We 're assigned a district . Our district includes only Contra Costa County and Alameda County . We need a site , and we have two criteria : One is we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be near BART . <p> Q : Is there a threshold for you where we have to have a decision in Oakland by this date or else we have to look at other options outside Alameda County ? <p> A : The threshold is the very one I said eight months ago : If the exciting next season starts , and we do n't have a firm direction  --  and this is more our responsibility than the community 's  --  we will have to look at all options that are on the table , and those will , at this point , remain in Alameda County . <p> Q : Is it mostly out of sentimentality that you are giving Oakland first shot ? You 're really looking at an area that not only has a fairly skimpy corporate base to help finance a new stadium but also a political climate that is averse to putting public money into a stadium . Why are you still looking at Oakland ? <p> A : The Coliseum , if you close your eyes , you say " What a great spot for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent major-league facilities . I 'm not saying they were n't at one time , but as far as we 're concerned , it 's not good for us right now . But it 's logical . It 's got BART , as I pointed out , and it 's got access to the freeway system . <p> So from a practical point of view , it 's an OK location for us if we could have a new venue there and the place was up-to-date . <p> I did n't come up here with sentimentality . But I will tell you that after a couple months of ownership and touching the fans and the players and the people who work for us and people who work part time for us and the older group that comes in and helps voluntarily , even though it 's not the largest demographic for sports in the country , it would be nice to stay . <p> Q : You mentioned the financing issue . What are your thoughts ? <p> A : Our idea was this : Most major-league ball parks  --  whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started out with a site . It 's very hard for a private person to acquire a site for a major facility . <p> So , our idea was , within reason , we would pay for a portion of a site . Now all of a sudden , land that looked like it was $20 a square foot , they hear the A 's are there , all of a sudden , it 's Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills . <p> Cities do n't have a lot of money these days , and when they go into the bonding capacity , at the end of the day , the city is on the hook no matter if you have a joint powers agreement or you have a parking bond or revenue bond or tax increment bond . <p> What cities do have , especially in the area of growth , and the Bay Area , good or bad , is growing , whether it 's growing right or not is not my decision totally , they have zoning rights . We call them entitlements ; you 're entitled to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency , in my opinion , for cities , governments and regionals and counties and so forth . <p> So let 's assume there is the Oakland army base , and that has a lot of demands from a lot of groups , and it 's not a great location for a ballpark . It 's a piece of land I think the city owns , but if not , they can get to it . <p> Let 's assume that developers , not so much ourselves , feel that is a great housing location . Our idea might be that since it 's not zoned right now but is to be zoned or to be entitled , why not entitle it for 3,000 apartment units ? <p> Those units might be worth $100,000 a piece . It 's sort of your land value . Whether we 're the developer or we join with a developer or a developer that we 're not associated with says , " We 'll pay $300 million for those entitlements rights . " <p> We 're saying to the city , " That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for free . Put it into the ballpark . If the ballpark costs $500 million , we 'll add the $200 million , take care of the overruns , and we 'll do the land under it . " <p> That entitlement is a value , is a currency they can help us with . So what do they get out of it ? They get a ballpark , which they 'll own , and we 'll have a longer lease than we have today , and somebody will build 3,000 apartment units . We think it 's a very interesting idea . <p> In talking to a lot of people who are a little more creative in thinking in government and the private side , they think it 's a unique approach . It 's not totally , but you could call it a huge subsidy if you want . You could call it a clever way of getting through the process . <p> Q : So the city gives you entitlements and you then pass them onto the developer and they pay you ? <p> A : Or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use our landlord as our focal point , I mean the Joint Powers Authority , which is half city and half county , is those entitlements ( that help us ) to build the ballpark in the city of Oakland do n't have to be in Oakland . <p> They can be entitlements that might be in Dublin if someone has land . So it does n't have to be in one place , and it does n't have to be to one party . It 's just one element of it . <p> Q : Are you assuming if you were to get some kind of subsidy of that form , that you would have to go to the ballot at some point in Oakland ? <p> A : I think we would have to go to the ballot anywhere , even if we were doing it totally out of our own checkbook . Because today you have all these issues . We have traffic and so forth . That 's another good reason why the Coliseum works . <p> It wo n't produce a lot more traffic if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ballot , " we 're talking about making sure that what 's planned for the area is acceptable for the community . If it is n't , to heck with it . <p> But we 're not going to conduct a campaign and hire every political consultant within 100 miles of Oakland to do it , or any other city . We 'll stay where we 're at or find something else . <p> There has to be an energy behind this , and it ca n't be the politicians saying , " I 'm all for baseball . " There has to be a driving force on the public and private side , no matter where we go . <p> Q : How would you characterize the energy you 're finding in Oakland ? ( Former Oakland City Manager ) Robert Bobb was a big advocate . Are you seeing any momentum ? How did this idea of entitlement go over in Oakland ? <p> A : The entitlement idea seems to be resonating OK . Oakland has a limited amount of staff and an unlimited amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that said " We 'll get to this ballpark if we possibly can ? " No . But at the same time , anytime we 've asked for help or asked for discussion , they 've been as cooperative as they can be within the priorities they have . <p> The biggest challenge is it 's a built-up community , so there 's not a lot of land around . We kept asking , " Is there a site ? " My predecessors , who were great owners , turned over a great operation to us . They were n't really that focused on the venue issue . It 's now become a major issue for Major League Baseball and ourselves . <p> As most of you know , we finally said , " OK , we 'll give our ideal for a site . " We looked around the area , and we see the area quite blighted . The moment we see the area blighted , all of sudden it becomes the most gorgeous area in the history of urban development . <p> We 're also in a redevelopment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can accomplish three things if we go north of our park and do what we call an urban ballpark village , " which got a lot of applause from designers and architects and people in the know . It was an A-plus in urban planning and an F in implementation right now . <p> What we said is , we 'll do this entitlement stuff and we 'll do it ourselves and use the money to build up retail , which they needed and , we hope , residential and the ballpark . <p> But unfortunately , we were looking at acreage that has 69 or 70 property owners . We were n't out to spend the rest of our lives , even if we had the right to do it , with a big eminent-domain club . We were n't out to do that . <p> Q : Let 's back up for a second . Why do you need a new stadium ? <p> A : How long do we have ? We have one of the most despicable operations . In terms of numbers , we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another team . So it comes to the end of the season , all of a sudden our outfield turns into a football field and a football field turns into a baseball field . <p> And that stinks . I do n't care how much rationalization there is , it 's not good for us . I do n't want to have ( outfielder Mark ) Kotsay hurt his back because the playing surface is changed . <p> I want the best playing surface possible for baseball . I want all our view sights , all our sight lines , to be related to baseball , not football . I want the people in your industry , the television people , to have the most modern facilities possible so we can compete in our market television-wise and wireless-wise . <p> We have 140 deficiencies in there . If you want to go over them all , I should have brought a little notebook . <p> Q : Despite your 140 points on why the Coliseum is not the proper facility for you , people on the outside looking in will say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proficient teams in the Bay Area . <p> The attendance is about 2.2 million  --  right around middle of the road and somewhat higher than teams that have new ballparks . <p> Every year , you get a nice chunk of revenue sharing , pretty much the same amount that the Giants get . It seems like a pretty comfortable situation as is . It might not be progressive thinking in your mind , but taxpayers and politicians will look at your home now and say , " You do n't have a bad deal , why do n't you just stay there ? " <p> A : I want to win a World Series . I 'm not in this to be second or third place or rationalize about bad this or bad that . We wanted to be able to compete . <p> That money we get , the charity we get , that money from the league , the only reason we 're getting it is we are in a market where we 're not supporting ourselves , so we get support . It 's wonderful . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's fine . Somewhere , that will come to an end . We would rather be paying it out rather than receiving it . <p> The point is we have 2.1 million in attendance , and we value those people very much , but our average per-capita ticket price and per-capita expenditure means that we do n't have enough wattage to add another food outlet up there . <p> I 'm told it will blow the whole place up . With the kind of winning record that Billy Beane and the guys have produced , we should be doing better than 2 million . It 's not good enough trying to keep the status quo . <p> Q : How about that upper deck ? You 're knocking off 15,000 seats to customers , and that usually sells out the Giants game or the Red Sox . <p> There is probably no way you are going to draw as many as the 2.1 million you attracted in 2005 , but months or years from now , you can say " We did n't draw as much , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to get out of Oakland or move to San Jose " or something . <p> A : We have to have a new venue , whether we have six decks or one deck . If anybody thinks that is the reason for that , that is their opinion . We looked at some samples , and I think it is going to look great . Most teams could live with 35,000 seats very nicely in Major League Baseball , including the White Sox . <p> The cost of opening up the third deck to security just is n't good . It does n't look good . I think we will accommodate our fans . We 'll still have the proportionate lower-priced seats . <p> If somebody wants to attribute some Machiavellian motive to that , I 'm used to that in baseball . <p> Q : Can you talk about the skybox and luxury box situation ? How many do you have in Oakland ? <p> A : I do n't know how many we have . We have them all over the place . We got them on Mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but baseball players look like they 're this big . And you miss the outfield a little bit . Our box system was probably great when they built it , but it 's terrible today . It 's just that simple . <p> We 're having a lot of fun with venue design ( for the new ballpark ) but it 's like building a house without a lot . We 're talking about a smaller venue , based on our market somewhere between 32,000 and 35,000 seats . <p> We 're talking about around 80 private boxes , but 40 of them  --  again these numbers change every day  --  will be for four to six people . So instead of every corporation having to spend $200,000 , we 'll be able to have a market hopefully that is a little cheaper in terms of the absolute price . <p> The ( St. Louis ) Cardinals ' new stadium is under construction right now . Every one of their boxes have been sold for 10 years , to my knowledge , at a set price with some escalation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a community . ( The team says , ) " We 're not looking for charity . We 'll provide a service for that . " <p> Q : Are you getting that type of feedback from the corporate community in Oakland ? <p> A : We have n't tested it , but I 'll have to say that we 're probably going to find it difficult . There are bets around the office : Can we sell that many boxes ? The answer is , I do n't know . The number of businesses with $100 million in revenue or more in the city of Oakland and Alameda County is probably very limited . <p> But we 're not talking about just corporations , we 're talking about lawyers and doctors and fans and so forth . We 're not talking about an elitist thing , it 's just part of the market you have to have for sports . <p> Q : Can we talk about the site again ? You mentioned going northward from the Coliseum and the problems with so many small property owners in the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go south along Hegenberger ( Road ) . <p> A : We need a connection to BART , so that hurts that particular property . South of the Coliseum is like a triangle . So someone said , I think on the JPA , said , " Could you put it south of the site ? " It 's privately owned , in the city of Oakland . It 's not part of the JPA . I said we 'll look at it . Physically , we probably can . There are some issues , power lines and so forth . <p> So we suggested the following : The triangle would be a proper extension of the Coliseum whether we used it or not . It 's just a normal piece that they should have acquired . We looked at it . It looked like it was worth about $20 to $25 a square foot in today 's market . <p> We said , " We do n't know if we can work all the things we need to work out , but we 'll contribute $20 to $25 a foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out it 's $75 a square foot , maybe no one wants it . But the city of Oakland should give the JPA powers to acquire that . In the worst case , or best case maybe , let 's assume the area does n't work for building but it works for parking . <p> If we could fit the ballpark on the north side of the Coliseum lot , not north of 66th Avenue , but just north , well the Raiders and Warriors might say , " Gee whiz , we do n't want you to build a ballpark in our parking lot for the next two , three or four years . " <p> But if the JPA controlled that triangle and made that parking , the inconvenience of that development process going on north ( would be mitigated . ) <p> Q : How long will you wait before you entertain an offer from San Jose or Las Vegas ? <p> A : First of all , we ca n't consider offers . Unfortunately , I 'm a close friend of the commissioner ( Bud Selig ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't fight with the commissioner . We have these territories , and we 're staying within our territories . It is n't just a facade statement . I know San Jose better than I know Oakland , and I think there are some opportunities there , but right now , that area is Giants territory . We may talk to the Giants , but I have n't really exercised a lot of energy on that . <p> Q : If not for the territorial rights , would San Jose be your first choice ? Would you be willing to pay the Giants to give up their territorial rights ? Could the territorial rights be a matter of negotiation ? <p> A : In answer to your first question , it would be a consideration , not necessarily our first choice . Our first choice is the one we are focused on . Life is a lot easier for us . Our next choice would be Fremont and San Jose . <p> I 'm very partial to downtown San Jose . I think sports there could be very great for the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have someone ( to negotiate with ) . The other side says there is no negotiation . I 'm the world 's leading negotiator . <p> Would they deserve anything ? It 's really up to Major League Baseball . The answer is we would be happy to figure out what 's fair . If we 're hurting somebody moving somewhere , there should be an adjustment someplace . <p> Q : Could the territorial rights be a matter of negotiation ? I 've talked to Larry Baer about this , and he says it is not . But from your perspective , is it an insurmountable issue ? <p> A : You would have to ask Larry Baer and Peter Magowan that . They 've always been cooperative talking about it , but they believe  --  and I have no way other to suggest that they are not correct  --  they have a very important territorial right to them and their sponsors , and I have not disputed that . I feel differently about it , but I 'm not the umpire here . <p> Q : Could you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , projected revenue and costs ? Do you have any new ideas for revenue generation ? <p> A : Thanks to Steve Schott and Ken Hoffman , we inherited a very well-run business in terms of numbers of people , in terms of results , in terms of discipline and in terms of quality . <p> The first thing I did was extend contracts with our president and our general manager . We worked out an equity situation . That was probably the most important free agent signings I did since we bought the team . <p> Both the general manager , the president and the staff have exceeded my expectations from a professional side and a personal side . It 's a decent homespun business in a small market . The goal for most teams is to keep their salaries between 50 and 52 percent of revenue . That 's our goal ; so if revenues increase , we 'll increase our salaries . <p> Q : Have you been making money every year ? <p> A : Before debt , we are making some money , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below that . The fans do n't see that . They want to go , and they want you to win . My closest friend in baseball , besides the commissioner , is ( Chicago White Sox owner ) Jerry Reinsdorf . I want to be in a parade like he was in . <p> ON SITES FOR A NEW BALLPARK " Our goal is to try and stay , though it 's becoming difficult , in the city of Oakland , if not in the county of Alameda . " <p> ON USING ENTITLEMENTS TO HELP FUND A BALLPARK : " It 's not totally , but you could call it a huge subsidy if you want . You could call it a clever way of getting through the process .
