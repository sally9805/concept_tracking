Strangely enough , it would be the oak trees that Justine Burnelli remembered from the day Centurion Station died . She had been hurrying toward the safety bunker doors , along with everyone else in the garden dome , when she glanced back over her shoulder . The thick emerald lawn was littered with the debris of the party : mashed canapTs stamped into the grass , broken glasses and plates juddering about as colossal gravity waves washed across the station in fast , unrelenting succession . Overhead , the timid light emitted by the nebulae surrounding the galactic core was being smeared into pastel streaks by the dome 's emergency force fields . Justine felt her weight reducing again . Yells of surprise and near panic broke out from the staff pressing against her as they all fought for traction on the glowing orange path . Then a crack like a thunderbolt echoed across the dome . One of the huge lower boughs on a two-hundred-year-old oak tree split open close to the thick trunk , and the bough crashed down . Leaves swirled upward like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , further fissures opening along the length of the trunk . It twisted as it started to fall into its neighbor . The elegant little tree house platform on which the band had been playing barely a minute earlier splintered and snapped apart . The last glimpse Justine had was of a couple of red squirrels scampering out of the toppled giants . <br> The malmetal safety bunker doors contracted behind her , and for a moment she was enveloped within an oasis of calm . It was a bizarre image : Everyone still dressed in his or her best party clothes , breathing heavily with disheveled hair and anxious faces . Director Trach ? tenberg was standing beside her , looking around wild-eyed . <br> " You okay ? " he asked . <br> She nodded , not quite trusting her voice . <br> Another of the gravity waves swept through the station . Once again Justine felt her weight lessen . Her u-shadow accessed the station 's net , and she pulled out the sensor images of the sky above . The Raiel 's DF spheres were still accelerating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked that the Silverbird was unaffected by the weird gravity waves the DF spheres were throwing off . The starship 's smartcore told her it was maintaining position just above the dusty lava field that served as the station 's landing area . <br> " I 've just conferred with our alien colleagues , " Director Trachtenberg announced . He smiled wryly . " Those that talk to us , anyway . And we all agree the gravity shifts are beyond anything the safety systems were designed for . With regret I am ordering an immediate evacuation . " <br> Several people groaned in dismay . <br> " You ca n't , " Graffal Ehasz complained . " This is what we 're here for . Dear Ozzie , man , the data this event is spewing out . What we can learn is unprecedented ! We ca n't just crawl away because of some safety restriction imposed by a committee back in the Commonwealth . " <br> " I understand your concern , " Trachtenberg said calmly . " If the situation alters , we will return . But for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see that most of the staff was relieved , while Ehasz and a small hard-core science clique radiated resentment . When she opened her mind to the local gaiafield , the clash of emotions was pronounced , but Ehasz was definitely in the minority . <br> Trachtenberg leaned in close to Justine and quietly asked : " Can your ship cope with this ? " <br> " Oh , yes , " she assured him . <br> " Very well ; if you would please depart with the rest of us . " <br> " Of course . " <br> Through her link with the smartcore she saw the safety bunkers break the surface , titanium-black spheres bubbling up out of the dusty lava plain . They started to glide smoothly toward the waiting starships . <br> With the evacuation procedures obviously working , Justine 's nerves calmed considerably . She asked the Silverbird 's smartcore to open a link along the tenuous navy communication relay all the way back to the Commonwealth , thirty thousand light-years away . " Dad ? " <br> " You 're okay , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " <br> Leaking along the minuscule bandwidth was the faintest sensation of a smile . Warm Caribbean sunlight was shining on his lips . It was a comfort that delivered a completely unexpected emotional jolt to Justine . She felt her throat muscles tensing as her eyes filled with tears and her cheeks flushed . Goddamn this stupid body , she raged at its weakness . But she smiled back weakly , ignoring the way people in the shelter were looking at her . " Yeah , I 'm okay . " <br> " Good , then get a load of this . I 've been monitoring the navy relay link to Centurion Station . Your new friend Trachtenberg just called the Cleric Conservator to tell him about the expansion phase . He did that before he even bothered to warn the navy what was happening . " <br> Justine was proud of the way she managed to avoid glancing in Trachtenberg 's direction . Okay , maybe this old body 's not quite so useless , after all . " Really . How interesting . " <br> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dreamer told his Skylord pal that he was n't going to lead anyone into the Void . Next thing we know , this expansion begins . I do n't know what your take is , but nobody back here thinks it 's a coincidence . " <br> " The Second Dreamer caused this ? " <br> " It was n't deliberate . At least I seriously hope it was n't . Cause and effect , I guess . The Skylords exist to ferry souls into the Heart of the Void , and someone tells them that their new supply is going to be cut off . Junkies tend to get irritated and irrational about such things . " <br> " The Skylords are n't junkies . " <br> " Do n't take everything so literally . I 'm doing metaphors or allegories  --  some shit like that . Point is , now that they know we 're out here waiting to be guided , if we do n't come to them . . . " <br> " They come to us , " she whispered . <br> " Looks like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <br> " The original ship did . Somehow . " <br> " Has the Second Dreamer said anything ? " <br> " Not a goddamn word , not even ' oops , sorry . ' Conceited little turd . I thought I was arrogant , but Jeezus ! " <br> " Well , he 's going to have to do something . " <br> " That 's the consensus back here , too . The thing is , Living Dream is closing in on him . That 's going to make serious trouble if they get their hands on him ; our friend Ilanthe will make sure of that . " <br> Justine accessed the data coming from the station , watching with concern as their life support equipment was stressed close to its limit by the gravity waves . " It does n't get much worse than this , Dad . " <br> " Shit , I 'm sorry , angel . Are you going to get out all right ? " <br> " You know you do n't have to worry about me . Hang on for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> People were activating their personal force fields as the airlock 's outer door parted . Some of them also were taking pressure suits from the bunker 's lockers , making sure they were safe . Justine knew she could depend on her biononics to protect her from anything the unnamed planet could throw at her . Her integral force field strengthened around her . She slipped her heeled pumps off and followed the others out through the triple pressure curtain . Ten aluminum steps and she was standing on the lava in bare feet and a completely incongruous little black cocktail dress . Tremors managed to shake the soles of her feet through the protective cushion of the force field . A gentle argon breeze fluttered around her , raising short-lived twisters of dust that never came above her knees . <br> The bunker had come to rest a hundred meters beyond the squat building holding the base 's main airlock . Two of the five navy ships were poised on either side of her , hanging a few meters above the ground on ingrav , rocking slightly as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose of one to see the Silverbird waiting a farther twenty meters beyond it . Its simple purple ovoid shape , holding a lot steadier than the navy ships , was a welcome sight . She grinned in relief and scurried underneath . The airlock at the base of the fuselage bulged inward , opening into a dark funnel leading to the heart of the ship . The smartcore was already countering gravity to pull her inside when she saw something moving on the horizon . Something impossible . <br> " Stop , " she commanded . <br> Her feet paused ten centimeters above the lava . Retinal inserts zoomed in . It was a mounted Silfen . The elflike hominoid was clad in a thick cobalt-blue coat embroidered with a fabulous stipple of jewels that sparkled in the wavering pastels of starlight . His black hat was tall and pointed , with a simple gold ribbon fluttering from the tip . A gloved hand gripped a long phosphorescent spear that he held aloft , as if in salute . It might have been such a gesture , for he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirrups . As if his appearance was n't astonishing enough , she was dumbfounded by his mount . The creature most closely resembled a terrestrial rhinoceros , except it was almost the size of an elephant and had two flat tails that swept from side to side . Its long shaggy fur was bright scarlet , and the four horns curving from the sides of its long head were devilishly sharp and curved . Justine , who once had ridden on the Charlemagnes that the old Barsoomians had produced on Far Away , knew that this fearsome beast was a true warrior animal . Her ancient body instinctively produced a flood of worry hormones at the sight of it . <br> The Silfen simply should n't have been there . She 'd never known one of their paths had led to this remote , desolate planet . And he was an oxygen breather ; so , she suspected , was his lethally regal mount . This tenuous radiation-saturated argon atmosphere was deadly to living things . Then she grinned at herself . Who was she to make such a claim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars in nothing more than a disgracefully short cocktail dress ? <br> So it was n't an absolute impossibility to find a Silfen here or to find that he was using some technological protection from the environment . <br> But . . . " Why ? " she whispered . <br> " The Silfen live to experience , " Gore told her , equally absorbed by the alien 's presence . " Face it , my girl , you do n't get a much bigger experience than watching the end of the galaxy crashing down around you . " <br> She 'd forgotten that she 'd left the link open . " A very short experience , " she retorted sourly . " And what is that thing he 's riding ? " <br> " Who knows ? I remember Ozzie saying the Silfen he encountered on a winter planet rode to the hunt on odd creatures . " <br> " Odd , not terrifying . " <br> " Does it matter ? I imagine he 's here on the toughest steed he can find in honor of the event . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that section of the galaxy . " <br> " A butch starship ? " But it broke her enchantment with the strange alien . She bowed her head formally at him . He dipped the spear in return and sat back on his small saddle . <br> The Silverbird drew her up into the small luxurious cabin . Once inside , she relaxed into a deep curving chair that the deck extended . Within the Advanced Neural Activity ( ANA )  --  designed craft she was as safe as it was possible for any human to be . The starship 's sensors showed her the last of the station staff hurrying into the airlocks of the navy ships . Another two Silfen had joined the first watcher . Her father was right , she acknowledged : They would come here only for something momentous . For her , their presence served only to amplify the whole deadly panorama unfolding outside . <br> " Let 's go , " she told the smartcore . <br> The Silverbird rose from Centurion Station ahead of all the other starships . As the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strangely varied flock : Commonwealth Navy ships sleek beside the cumbersome Ticoth vessels , the glittering purple spheres of the Ethox dancing nimbly around the big tankers containing the Suline . At another time she would have enjoyed traveling in the elegant avianlike artificial-life constructs that soared and swooped to carry the Forleene away from danger . Despite the devastation raging all around them , few of the departing species could resist a quick scan in the direction of the metal cube housing the Kandra . None , therefore , were wholly surprised when the whole mass simply lifted cleanly from the dusty ground and accelerated smoothly away from the collapsing structures of the observation project . <br> Justine was ridiculously proud of the way none of them seemed able to match the Silverbird 's acceleration . It had taken the ultradrive ship just a few seconds to reach an altitude of five hundred kilometers , where it stopped to scrutinize the last minutes of Centurion Station . Another gravity wave shook the hull so violently that the onboard gravity generator barely could counter it . Justine felt a distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away below the fuselage , its ancient geology stubbornly resistant to the worst effects of the awesome gravity waves washing invisibly through its mantle . Underneath her , the hot Ethox tower was the first to succumb , rocking from side to side until the undulations became too great to be compensated for by the safety systems . It toppled with slow grace to shatter against the unyielding lava . Big waves of water cascaded out from splits in the Suline tanks , pushing a spume of debris ahead of them . Flying spray quickly solidified into sharp needles of hail , to be reabsorbed by the dark water . Inevitably , the cold won , producing a rumpled ice lake three kilometers across . Thin gray clouds streamed out of cracks in both the human and the Forleene domes , quickly dissipating in the weak gusts of argon . <br> In an astonishingly short time the structures were flattened , joining the greater enclave of ruins that marked the site where hundreds of alien species had spent millennia observing the terrible , enigmatic Void at the center of the galaxy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As if they could feel what was happening beyond the Wall stars , the massive ion storms were seething with a rare angry sheen , brighter than any she 'd seen in her brief time at the station . <br> Continues ...
