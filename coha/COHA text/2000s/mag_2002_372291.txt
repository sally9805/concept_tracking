In the trial of Andrea Yates for the murder of her children , it is the job of prosecutors to prove that no matter how deep her psychosis , she knew right from wrong . As the testimony is making clear , in the throes of her illness she lived for months with confused thoughts not only about right and wrong but also about good and evil  --  because she believed she was the devil . <P> Through bouts of post-partum psychosis , the images and catchwords of the Bible became ways for Andrea to express her mental darkness . She received no guidance from established religious institutions ; she and her husband Rusty chose to home-church their family three times a week . She earmarked pages in her Bible about a mother 's obligation to raise her children or face the consequences , and about the death penalty being the only way to get rid of demons inside . She came to believe that she had failed so badly to measure up to her own extreme ideals of motherhood ( she thought the kids should say their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the jail psychiatrist , " the kids were destined to perish in the fires of hell . " <P> Her fate depends on how the jury parses her knowledge of good and evil . The prosecution has argued that she contemplated the murders for two years and later showed signs of remorse , all proof of moral clarity . But the defense will try to show that her rationalization process was insane . The jail psychiatrist testified that upon her arrest , she said , " I was so stupid . Could I have killed just one to fulfill the prophecy ? Could I have offered Mary her youngest ? " The jury could begin deliberating the case  --  and the conundrum of Andrea Yates ' mind  --  this week or next . <P>  --  By Timothy Roche
