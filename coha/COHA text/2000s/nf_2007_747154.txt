A late twentieth-century slogan proclaims that service in the United States Navy " is not just a job , it 's an adventure ; " the same could be said about the British Royal Navy of the early eighteenth century . The opportunity to see new sights and to take part in glorious battles , the potential for considerable prize money , and the freedom from worldly responsibilities should have attracted young men to volunteer for this noble calling . Such romantic notions rarely lived up to reality once on board and under way . Instead , horror stories  --  some exaggerated but most not  --  of physical hardships and strict discipline abounded and dissuaded many from pursuing this career . Manpower shortages in turn led to the use of press gangs to fill the ranks . The sailors ' unfortunate plight did not go unnoticed , however . A few voices , one of whom was James Oglethorpe , took up the cause and sought assistance for these oppressed men . More popularly recognized for his work with the charitable colony of Georgia , Oglethorpe dabbled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An examination of his efforts to ameliorate the sailors ' conditions will show how this first foray into philanthropy illustrates the two major themes , assisting the downtrodden and strengthening the British Empire , that would carry over into his other better-known activities . <p> At age twenty-six , James Oglethorpe inherited his family 's estate at Godalming in Surrey , and he became a member of the House of Commons representing the borough of Haslemere in 1722 , a position previously held by his father and his older brother and one that he would occupy for thirty-two years . Although his district consisted of few voters , mostly tenants on his own land , he expressed interest in the needs of the poor and the concerns of the empire in order to strengthen and preserve the state . He worked hard to eradicate any taint of Jacobitism that may have stuck to his family name , and he developed a reputation as an independent and consistent thinker . The young Oglethorpe gave eloquent yet honest speeches and maintained high Tory principles without becoming pigeonholed as a " party man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a junior Member of Parliament , Oglethorpe served on more than forty different committees that covered diverse issues and , unlike his more senior counterparts , he actively worked on his assignments . He investigated land reclamation , road construction , and bridge building as well as public safety matters such as gunpowder storage and fire regulation . He considered petitions from various tradesmen including bricklayers , gold and silversmiths , locksmiths , and dyers . He began to look into the situation of debtors and sat on several committees that wanted to alleviate their suffering through employment or public relief . He also examined problems of river transport , studied the abuses of river mariners , and regulated a relief fund for shipwrecked sailors . Several of these boards offered practical experience that would prove vital to his largest project , the founding of Georgia , but others emphasized his personal interests in helping the less fortunate and in bolstering the British Empire. ( n2 ) These two matters came together often over the course of his career , but the first instance occurred with the appearance of a pamphlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The problems facing common sailors were not new topics in the halls of Parliament or in the public press . Others had petitioned for redress and relief for those miserable enlisted men who suffered innumerable discomforts and abuses during their stint at sea , but such documents failed to bring about any significant changes in naval policy . Moreover , criticism of the armed forces during time of war looked unpatriotic. ( n3 ) Regular conflicts with neighboring Spain and France over traditional issues of navigation rights and colonial claims continually strained all of the Royal Navy 's resources , including manpower . With a semblance of peace after the conclusion of Queen Anne 's War or the War of Spanish Succession in 1713 , the navy should have scaled back its fleet and conserved its supplies ; instead , all ships remained on alert as officers anxiously awaited the resumption of hostilities . In the meantime , lowly sailors continued to endure mistreatment , hoping that someone might champion their cause and relieve their distress . <p> What sorts of conditions prompted these protests ? What reason did sailors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been grateful for the chance to serve their country , to indulge in adventure , and to gain useful employment in a skilled profession that not only paid its employees but also fed , clothed , and sheltered them . What was the problem ? <p> Life in the early eighteenth-century Royal Navy was anything but a pleasure cruise . The men attracted to and associated with the job developed an unsavory status that prejudiced many others against naval careers. ( n4 ) Characterized as uncouth and even uncivilized , a sailor 's reputation for drinking , debauchery , and violence preceded him everywhere he went . His unusual clothes , demeanor , gait , and language revealed his occupation as soon as he set foot on land . On board ship , his courage , strength , and skills were unquestioned and unmatched , but ashore , he was literally a fish out of water floundering his way among strangers. ( n5 ) <p> Once back at sea in his natural habitat , however , the rotation between shifts and breaks dominated a sailor 's life . The boatswain 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailor received his duties based on his assigned watch and the day of the week . All chores required intense physical exertion under demanding circumstances , and cleaning and repairing the ship , maintaining and rotating the sails , and performing regular drills and exercise occupied ordinary weekdays . Sundays featured religious services when a chaplain accompanied the crew , or meant time off , aside from the mandatory tasks that kept the ship afloat and on course . Rough seas and severe weather challenged and intensified the labors of all sailors , but these phenomena were the exception rather than the rule . England 's rocky seacoast offered its own dangers , and coastal blockades or scouting missions presented real possibilities of sudden death . Wartime made every activity more hazardous , and during the early eighteenth century , the Royal Navy constantly stood on guard for enemy vessels , with occasional hostile engagements , regardless of the diplomatic situation. ( n6 ) <p> If a sailor failed to fulfill his duties to satisfaction , he received reprimand for his negligence in order to preserve the ship 's utility and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land and at sea , with flogging with a cat-o ' - nine- tails as the preferred method . Although naval regulations forbade more than twenty lashes , few officers practiced such moderation , as penalties of tens or even hundreds of strokes laid upon the bare back were customary for any number of misdeeds . In between sets of beatings , the wrongdoer could be " pickled " or washed with " a Tub of Brine or Pickle from their Salt Meat . into which some ( to make the Punishment the greater ) have caus 'd more Salt to be put . " ( n7 ) Other sentences included gagging where the victim was tightly bound in kneeling position with a large bar wedged into his mouth or " running the gauntlet " where the offender dashed through a line of his peers armed with small whips and canes . Still , flogging surpassed them all in popularity and frequency . Discipline was strict and swift to maintain law and order among the ship 's company , and sailors learned right from wrong quickly under these unforgiving circumstances . Harsh bodily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Royal Navy made no exceptions. ( n8 ) <p> Despite these strict rules and regulations , sailors learned to cope with their unfortunate situation and spent their off-duty time involved in any number of leisurely pursuits , most of which occurred in their quarters below deck . Music and dancing or games and gambling filled their free hours , although their physical conditions often made such diversions difficult to enjoy . Sailors shared their cramped spaces with all the ship 's supplies and armaments , not to mention their few personal possessions stored in trunks or lockers . Tables straddled cannons , storage barrels served as chairs when available , and hammocks swung from the rafters . The multiple levels below the main deck experienced little or no sunlight or fresh air resulting in constant darkness , poor ventilation , and damp surroundings. ( n9 ) <p> Within those cramped , dark , moist quarters were also stored the provisions for the entire voyage , including barrels of salted meat , hard biscuits , and alcoholic beverages . Such victuals rarely satiated the hungry and weary crew and often made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board even when a ship docked in port , the sailors remained at the cook 's mercy . Without modern preservation , salted or pickled beef and pork offered the only opportunity for any form of meat . Biscuits stored longer and easier than bread , although they attracted similar insects and vermin and gave little satisfaction in terms of taste , calories , or nutrition . Oatmeal or rice sometimes graced the ship 's stores , which cooks added to water or broth to make gruel or porridge . Sailors also received an allotment of butter and cheese , but these items spoiled rapidly resulting in noxious odors and inedible rations. ( n10 ) Alcoholic beverages were better alternatives than stale or putrid water but still lacked the nutrients necessary to fulfill daily requirements and suffered similar problems of fermentation and decay. ( n11 ) <p> Substandard clothing and hygiene only exacerbated the uncomfortable environment . Although no standardized uniform existed at this time , each man received one complete set of clothes upon enlistment that matched their shipmates in fashion and color , usually blue and white . Sailors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills since they bore the financial burden of purchasing any additional pieces . That single uniform quickly showed the wear and tear of their labor-intensive work , however , and laundering with salt water and harsh soap further deteriorated the material . Personal cleanliness also suffered as the men shared germs , dirt , and stench ; few opportunities or incentives for bathing existed. ( n12 ) <p> The combination of unsanitary quarters , rations , clothing , and hygiene inevitably led to illness and death . Many more sailors succumbed to disease than injury in battle . One of the most common problems was scurvy , which was caused by a lack of vitamin C. Doctors at the time recommended the addition of fresh or dried fruits and juices to the routine provisions as a preventative measure , but such suggestions received little attention from the naval administration. ( n13 ) Other ailments took their toll on crewmembers including yellow fever , typhus , and malaria , especially since much maritime activity took place in tropical climates . Dehydration associated with drinking alcohol and eating salted provisions only worsened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they debilitated the ship 's company as the various contagions worked their way through the vulnerable ranks , and made keeping a working complement of healthy and able-bodied crewmen a challenge. ( n14 ) <p> Perhaps a sailor could justify enduring these arduous conditions for the right amount of money , but even that incentive failed to lure interested parties . Captured prizes inevitably went to the officers , so such bonuses were an unreliable form of earnings . Voluntary recruits sometimes received a financial reward to join , but bounties remained small and rare . These tokens supplemented a meager salary of eighteen to twenty-four shillings a month , a rate that did not change throughout the eighteenth century regardless of war or peace . Sailors collected their full pay at the end of a cruise , and for their service they received a " ticket " redeemable at the Admiralty Office in London . Only the holder could cash in a ticket , so passing the script to a family member yielded no funds . Often , to acquire wages more quickly , a sailor would sell his ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a percentage of its value . The sailor took a significant cut in his take-home pay , but he obtained ready money faster . Others kept transferring from ship to ship , either voluntarily or forcibly , and missed that final day in port to collect their hard-earned ticket . If a sailor became extremely ill , he could be removed from the ship since he could not work and might contaminate other men . Such an action also resulted in forfeiture of pay. ( n15 ) <p> All these trying circumstances made recruitment difficult if not impossible at times . Few volunteered for such a thankless job with hardly any benefits , yet the Royal Navy needed a regular supply of sailors to maintain optimal performance . Manning the fleet remained one of the foremost challenges of the eighteenth century , and without an operative , ordered system to encourage enlistments , administrators turned to the age-old practice of impressment to solve their problem . Dating back to the Middle Ages , the temporary measure became a permanent institution , and the term originated from the word " prest " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join the service . Over time , the expression developed a more sinister connotation as the press gang , men charged with finding potential mariners and armed with a press-warrant authorizing their business , resorted to more underhanded tactics to acquire their recruits . Though some officers followed the law , the opportunities for abuse , bribery , and corruption abounded . The press gang hunted for men fit for sea duty to fulfill a certain quota , and all ages between eighteen and fifty-five were potential targets . Some occupations received exemptions , but in the heat of a press , anyone could be seized . Gangs usually focused their attention near docks and on poorer sections of town , and the greater demand for sailors , the more intense were the efforts to impress . Once captured , the victim was lodged with other prisoners until conveyance to the closest port , and then he was detained on a holding tender offshore until transfer to his assigned ship . The entire ordeal could take weeks and featured stark conditions with poor accommodations and even worse provisions . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petitions to higher powers rarely resulted in freedom. ( n16 ) <p> While many agreed that the press gang was offensive if not criminal , it endured as the standard method of recruitment throughout the late seventeenth and entire eighteenth centuries , because no one considered any other alternative . Often , half of a ship 's crew constituted pressed men , although that number fluctuated depending on war or peace and remains difficult to determine precisely since some volunteers might have been coerced to join . The public tolerated this odious practice because of tradition and efficiency , and those directly affected by its authority lacked the power or influence to cry out against the unfairness . One sufferer lamented to his wife : " When I left you , hevens noes it was with an akin hart for i thout it very hard to be hauld from you by a gang of rufins. " ( n17 ) With its victims swept abroad and their abandoned families left behind without protection , only a few stood up to the naval authorities for fear of becoming the next target. ( n18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however. ( n19 ) In 1727 , Parliament considered various proposals but reached no resolution . In reaction to this impasse , James Oglethorpe tackled the problems of press gangs and pay in " The Sailors Advocate , " which he published anonymously the following year as a fifty-two-page pamphlet. ( n20 ) Why he chose to conceal his identity remains unknown . Perhaps his inexperience in parliamentary politics played a role . With just over five years in office , his peers still regarded him as a junior member . His first speech in 1723 failed to prevent the banishment of a controversial bishop and had silenced his participation. ( n21 ) His family 's reputation as Jacobites also overshadowed him and caused colleagues to scrutinize his opinions and activities carefully. ( n22 ) Moreover , questioning traditional naval procedures looked unpatriotic and even treasonous while war with neighboring empires threatened . Oglethorpe 's anonymity , however , should not detract from the seriousness of his cause , especially considering his professional circumstances . <p> " The Sailor 's Advocate " expressed concern about the current weakened condition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not reformed and strengthened in the near future . In the introductory paragraph , the author attributed the present British trade and power to the supremacy of the navy and remarked that both the empire 's prosperity and its citizens ' liberty would be endangered if the navy should falter . After emphasizing the need to protect international commerce for the benefit of the whole nation , he moved on to what he believed was the greater problem of infringement on personal freedom and commenced a lengthy diatribe against the current policy of impressment. ( n23 ) <p> While the practice remained a tradition , its abuses and consequences continued to mount . Captains coerced men through alcohol , bribery , and force to join their crews , and no man was immune to these underhanded efforts . Despite complaints , little change occurred in the system . Instead , " pressing is carried on with impunity : and the man who is poor has no remedy , " wrote Oglethorpe . The custom itself was despicable , but more consequentially , its results damaged the Royal Navy in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore threatened the very foundation of English government . It also ruined the character and morale of the sailors by forcing them to serve against their will and without an opportunity to put their affairs in order or make proper arrangements for the care of their families . The author queried his readers : " How can it be expected that a man should fight for the liberty of others whilst he himself feels the pangs of slavery ? " Few would endure such oppression for any length of time , making desertion in foreign ports a real and serious problem . In fact , " rather than live under such hardships , . many have chosen to swim ashore at all hazards , though they have often failed in the attempt and afterwards have been seen dead , floating on the water . " Pressing also introduced men physically unfit for duty into the ranks , who then succumbed to illnesses at an alarming rate because of exposure to an unfamiliar and unsanitary environment in terms of air , heat , damp , and filth . The sudden shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at sea often resulted in disabilities and even death , which only contributed further to the problems of manning the navy. ( n24 ) <p> No one should endure such abuses , especially someone as vital to national security and trade as a sailor , Oglethorpe argued . " It is not the timber nor the iron of the ships of war which gives the dominion of the seas , but the sailors who man them , that are the strength of the NATION ; it is their skill and courage on which the safety of the ships themselves depends and should they be destroyed . what then must become of the Royal Navy is too evident , " he declared . He also noted that " sailors can not easily be made , nor can we keep the dominion of the seas without them . " Oglethorpe equated a pressed seaman with a slave since " slavery is nothing but service by force , " and since a man seized by the press gang and incarcerated on a ship without hope of redress or escape epitomized that confined condition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet it persevered nonetheless. ( n25 ) <p> The effects of impressment reached far beyond the immediate and detrimental costs to the Royal Navy . International trade suffered as men previously employed in commercial shipping ended up on military missions , leaving merchant ships to lie idle in port with their cargo left to spoil . Abandoned families had to fend for themselves when the heads of households were swept away without time to secure accommodations for any dependents , and the Admiralty Office offered no sympathy or provisions for the forsaken relations . Resentment against the Royal Navy increased dramatically , because such abusive policies did little to endear the profession among the general population , which led to fewer volunteers and more abductions . This process also presented a high financial burden for the administration in order to pay the press gangs and the armed guards necessary to retain the captured subjects . Members of the gangs often became tyrannical and merciless ruffians who wielded their newfound power with complete authority , further damaging naval credibility . Officers felt the negative repercussions of impressment as well . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press warrants to fill their ranks , and they answered for its mistakes and misdemeanors , which put a serious blot on an otherwise impressive and impeccable reputation . Since pressing discouraged enlistments , the lack of volunteers only resulted in more strenuous efforts to abduct victims , and so the evil cycle continued. ( n26 ) <p> While the entire system of impressment frustrated attempts to fill the depleted ranks with able-bodied and willing sailors , other problems compounded the crisis . Oglethorpe pointed out that " it is not want of sailors but want of inclination to serve that makes the scarcity of men , " and he highlighted their prisoner-like status , their poor wages , and their extreme living conditions as further reasons why so few volunteered for vacant positions . Of these obstacles , he addressed the issue of pay in detail , complaining that of the small twenty-two shillings per month salary , a sailor rarely took home more than a third after deductions for additional clothing and provisions while at sea . If he deserted or died , the sailor and his family collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones at home also received no assistance . Not until completion of the cruise did a sailor see even a fraction of his wages . Then , he obtained a ticket or promissory note for his pay , which he often sold out of expedience to financiers waiting on the docks to give him a small portion of ready money in exchange for his voucher . Thus , the poorly paid sailor seldom obtained the entirety of his promised yet meager salary , which gave little incentive to join the Royal Navy. ( n27 ) <p> Such exploitation demanded change . Oglethorpe surveyed the practices of other countries including France , the Netherlands , Sweden , and Venice as possible alternatives , and he asked for public opinions and ideas on the matter as well . He offered no immediate solution but instead focused on exposing the problem with strong language and practical yet shocking details that he hoped would attract the attention of Parliament and lead to redress and reform . Instead of including some plans for amelioration , he rushed his pamphlet to press so that its publication coincided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more notice and support for his cause. ( n28 ) <p> Throughout " The Sailors Advocate , " two themes endure : concern for the less fortunate and interest in the health of the British Empire , economically and militarily . Both of Oglethorpe 's main complaints about current naval procedure regarding impressment and pay directly affected society 's lower classes . He argued that press gangs routinely targeted the poor since they lacked necessary funding to support any legal battle for freedom . Moreover , the poor had no money to bribe members of the press gang . Because of their condition , they could not purchase supplemental provisions , they were more susceptible to contagions and death , and they usually abandoned a family that would become destitute without the male head of household . Oglethorpe 's detailed defense of the unfortunate demonstrated his recognition of the situation and his dedication to finding a solution to this discriminatory practice . <p> The more prominent theme in his pamphlet , however , remained his concern for the empire . The Royal Navy was a key factor to successful trade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence and power . Commerce accounted for more than five million pounds sterling in revenue , a sum that affected all aspects of the national economy . Without a well-manned navy to protect this substantial source of income , Britain faced dire consequences . In addition , those sailors pressed into military service left vacancies in the merchant marine , which resulted in idle ships and decreased profit . The navy itself presented a financial burden , since the payment of press gangs and the constant turnover of crews led to higher maintenance costs . <p> Besides the economic damage of such abuses , the military strength of the Royal Navy diminished accordingly . The harsh conditions of recruitment and service attracted few volunteers , and those who did join represented " none but the worst sort of men . and to them the floating bulwarks of England must be entrusted . " ( n29 ) Those pressed into service took advantage of the first opportunity to desert and often joined enemy forces as a source of wages but also as a form of revenge . Furthermore , Oglethorpe made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since neither expected any benefit or bonus from a job well done , they had no incentive to fulfill their duties to the best of their abilities . These current and unsatisfactory policies , therefore , hurt the Royal Navy both in terms of financial and military strength . <p> Although his pamphlet offered logical challenges to certain aspects of naval procedure , Oglethorpe only presented a moderate discussion of these specific problems . He remained focused on the issues of impressment and pay , and ignored such matters as living conditions or harsh penalties . Perhaps he only engaged topics that had recently come before Parliament and that he felt it could actually legislate or regulate . Maybe he chose to concentrate on a few matters rather than condemning all practices , overwhelming his readers with sordid details , and losing their interest and sympathy to his cause . Previous authors of protest literature , however , had addressed such issues as extreme corporal punishments and rotten provisions , so the topics were not unknown or unspoken despite the enormous difficulties in trying to alleviate these traditional problems . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his criticism to include these other areas and still maintained his argument about infringing on the rights of Englishmen . <p> Since his discourse on impressment dominated the pamphlet , readers may question his real motives . Was Oglethorpe interested in reform or social control ? Was he actually concerned about the men captured by press gangs , or was he more interested in the disruption caused by press gangs in terms of local law and order ? Their intimidating tactics and cruel activities led to panic and even riot in the streets , but by eliminating this odious practice , daily life could continue without interruption . Press gangs also represented an easy target for critique , one that most agreed needed reform but few knew where or how to begin . Oglethorpe thus appeared to strike a blow for the common sailor but in fact tackled a topic that generated little debate . <p> Oglethorpe 's lack of any solutions worked against his cause as well . Discussing the structure of other countries ' navies proved that he had thoroughly researched his chosen topic , but he failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apologizing for the rush to publication in order to catch the legislature in session seems like a handy excuse to cut corners and avoid controversy rather than strike a final forceful blow . The concluding section of " The Sailors Advocate " weakened his overall argument and left readers questioning how much of a champion for sailors ' rights Oglethorpe really was . <p> Although the pamphlet lacks the eloquence and vigor of his later endeavors , it does represent the start of Oglethorpe 's philanthropic career . Here , he expressed interest in the common man regardless of personal motivation . After all , he did not need to play to his constituency for votes since he represented a pocket borough made up of his own tenants . He showed his knowledge of political diplomacy by publishing anonymously and taking on issues previously exposed and lamented by other reformers ; he also demonstrated his close attention to imperial needs , both economic and military . Taken altogether , while " The Sailors Advocate " did little to alleviate the dreadful situation endured by involuntary sailors , it gave Oglethorpe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Oglethorpe 's two main themes , concern for the poor and the empire , would carry through his subsequent philanthropic projects . His early years in Parliament featured work on numerous committees , many of which initiated various reforms to help the underprivileged in London and throughout England . Several involved relief and assistance for debtors , but it was the death of his acquaintance Robert Castell in a debtor 's prison that prompted him to investigate this situation further . Castell fell under house arrest in June 1728 , but when his extensive bills continued to mount , he was incarcerated in Fleet Prison in London where smallpox raged among the inmates . Castell died within two weeks . Unable to save his friend , Oglethorpe used his previous experience and connections and took action ; two months after the tragedy , he chaired the first of several committees to investigate prison conditions throughout the city. ( n30 ) <p> Oglethorpe 's three reports , published in 1729 and 1730 , revealed not just to members of Parliament but to all sympathetic citizens the horrors that these minor criminals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the less fortunate and improving the empire . Conditions in Fleet Prison required prisoners to share beds and linens regardless of their state of health , and to pay a daily fee for their room and board . Additionally , all prison employees charged various rates for their services , from the clerks who kept the records and the turnkeys who locked the gates to the warden who oversaw the entire operation . Expenses mounted over time , increasing the size of the debt that had landed many victims in jail in the first place . Those prisoners who acted out of turn found themselves shackled in the dungeon , a damp , dark , miserable place underneath the prison. ( n31 ) <p> The situation at Fleet Prison was abysmal , but Marshalsea Prison was horrendous . Men and women packed into crowded , foul-smelling rooms with sickly , dying , and deceased persons , and detainees shared bed or floor space where available . They received no provisions except those supplied by the prisoner 's family and friends or by generous citizens , although such donations rarely reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutrition made infection and starvation real possibilities . Keepers used torture devices including thumbscrews , iron collars , and other implements to maintain their authority over unruly or outspoken inmates. ( n32 ) <p> King 's Bench Prison revealed similar appalling abuses . This time , however , Oglethorpe focused his report on financial misappropriations . Uncomfortable and unsafe conditions existed here as well , but the exorbitant rents and fees further bankrupted an indebted prisoner . Those who could not bribe prison officials received even worse treatment and accommodations . Although concerned citizens sent donations to assist these unfortunate victims , the prisoner rarely saw the items since officers and their favorites absconded with the gifts. ( n33 ) <p> Although Oglethorpe 's reports revealed the terrible circumstances in each prison with a few token examples to illustrate his point , these reports differ from his earlier work in that they offered solutions to the problems . His first testimony called for charges against the current and former wardens of Fleet Prison for " the most Notorious Breaches of his Trust , great Extortions , and the highest Crimes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they " hath Arbitrarily and Unlawfully loaded with Irons , put into Dungeons , and destroyed Prisoners for Debt under his Charge , treating them in the most Barbarous and Cruel Manner , in high Violation and Contempt of the Laws of this Kingdom " resulting in their arrest along with several cohorts. ( n34 ) His statement on Marshalsea Prison indicted the clerk and the keeper , and his deposition about King 's Bench Prison demanded actions to prevent bribery and permit proper distribution of charities. ( n35 ) Oglethorpe 's investigations led to the removal of corrupt administrators and freedom for thousands of mistreated debtors , and he received much attention and praise for his success in exposing and correcting these abuses . <p> From his work with debtor 's prisons , Oglethorpe learned a valuable lesson . While he described the atrocious conditions that debtors endured in prison , he also presented answers . He called for prosecution of dishonest officials and suggested alternative methods of punishment for these minor offences . He drew attention to a problem , but he also offered a resolution , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailors . The success of this latest strategy , not just to reveal an injustice but also to provide a solution , helped him in his most influential act of reform : the founding of Georgia . <p> The idea of developing the land south of Carolina was nothing new ; several propositions had already failed. ( n36 ) In 1730 , however , a group of English gentlemen including Oglethorpe put together a proposition that blended several important themes into one specific endeavor. ( n37 ) First , their new colony would serve as a place where " worthy poor " citizens , or those persons who had fallen on hard times because of circumstances beyond their control , could have a second chance at success . It would also be a safe haven where persecuted Protestants from continental Europe could relocate and practice their faith without fear of discrimination . Besides these philanthropic goals , the province would act as a military barrier against Spanish , French , and Indian attacks . Moreover , it offered countess opportunities to develop luxury goods , especially wine and silk , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more convinced King George II to sign the charter in June 1732 authorizing the creation of Georgia and its governing board , the Trustees . <p> In order to attract interest in the colony , several persons wrote promotional literature that emphasized these same themes of concern for the unfortunate and the empire . In " Some Account of the Designs of the Trustees for establishing the Colony of Georgia in America , " Benjamin Martyn , the Trustees ' secretary , contended that the Trustees would send poor families and persecuted Protestants to Georgia and establish them in a well-regulated town in order to give them employment , create a stronger southern defense , and provide cheap raw materials to the mother country. ( n38 ) In a much longer pamphlet , he discussed the " Reasons for Establishing the Colony of Georgia , " and reassured possible detractors that sending idle citizens abroad would strengthen , not diminish , the empire by lessening the burden on prisons and parishes and giving the unemployed work that would allow them the chance to recover their lost wages and self esteem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> Oglethorpe anonymously provided a pamphlet of his own in 1732 that demonstrates parallels between his earlier quest to help enlisted sailors and his new undertaking to develop an overseas colony . Its very title , " A New and Accurate Account of the Provinces of South-Carolina and Georgia : With many curious and useful Observations on the Trade , Navigation and Plantations of Great-Britain , compared with her most powerful maritime Neighbours in antient sic and modern Times , " clearly showed his continued concern for imperial and naval matters . Similar to other promotional literature , Oglethorpe extolled the virtues of Georgia , including its mild climate , fertile soils , and abundant forests . Despite its many positive qualities , the location had remained vacant of Indians because of their depopulation over the years through war and disease . The land south of Carolina thus presented the perfect opportunity to establish another British settlement in North America. ( n40 ) <p> The settlers who would occupy this new colony , however , were those unfortunates whom Oglethorpe tried to help on previous occasions . He argued that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miserable condition into which they had fallen because of circumstances beyond their control , and he included the recently liberated debtors in this category . By sending the indigent abroad , they would find worthy employment in various forms of agriculture for both personal and national benefit. ( n41 ) <p> Besides alleviating the plight of the poor , the creation of Georgia presented practical advantages to the British Empire . Previously idle workers would contribute to the imperial economy by supplying luxury items , especially silk , at reasonable prices and by increasing trade and making Great Britain more competitive in international markets . Additional southern settlements would also provide protection against possible Spanish and Indian invasions. ( n42 ) Consequently , Georgia offered philanthropic , economic , and military services to the larger sovereignty . <p> While most of the document focuses on broader issues , Oglethorpe did not neglect his earlier concern about mistreated sailors in his arguments for a charitable colony . He argued that since " The Tasks and Course of Life of Sea-faring Men are not to be learned in an Instant ; their Employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Application and Industry , " the cheapest way to train future seamen would be the extension of trade so that they could gain necessary skills through practice in the merchant marine . In fact , Great Britain 's success depended on its Royal Navy since its protective services allowed businesses and colonies to flourish . Without the navy 's regular assistance , the British Empire would lose thousands of tons of shipping and a half-million pounds in revenue . Oglethorpe contended : " Rice and Tobacco are more real and permanent Wealth than their richest Minerals .. And without a sufficient Force to defend it , the Possession of all Wealth is precarious . " The addition of Georgia would not only contribute more overseas commerce , but it would also provide material and military support to the neighboring island colonies . Most importantly , however , Oglethorpe concluded that " our Strength depends on our Shipping , and our Shipping on our wide extended Colonies . confirm us the more Powerfully in the Dominion of the Seas . " ( n43 ) The establishment of the new colony , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the private fleet , thereby increasing the pool of voluntary and experienced mariners as opposed to impressed and unskilled laborers , and by offering additional opportunities to test its defensive capabilities through constant guarding of commercial vessels . Thus , Oglethorpe 's essential points in this pamphlet not only use practical justifications for supporting the Georgia project , but they also include his personal interests of helping the poor , especially sailors , and improving the empire . <p> The promotional literature had its desired effect , and potential settlers rushed to the Trustees ' office to apply and interview for the coveted positions. ( n44 ) Oglethorpe surprised his colleagues by agreeing to accompany the first band of recruits to Georgia , and in February 1733 , he and his followers established Savannah . Although he never held an official position of power there , most immigrants looked to him for guidance and protection , which he supplied to the best of his abilities . He worked constantly organizing townships , fulfilling administrative duties , and helping new colonists get settled . He negotiated with the Spanish for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the South Carolinians for basic necessities . He prepared residents for possible war with Spain and commanded the troops assigned to the region 's defense , and once the conflict officially began in October 1739 , he oversaw all military operations , led several offensives into Spanish Florida , and held off a Spanish invasion on St. Simon 's Island. ( n45 ) <p> Despite all these efforts , Oglethorpe returned to England permanently in 1743 , and while he remained a member of the Trustees , his enthusiasm for the entire project waned as other matters , public and private , distracted him . Perhaps he had had enough of running a colony by himself , with more criticism than support from all levels , including his fellow Trustees . They too had lost interest in the charitable enterprise , and few took notice of what was happening in their wayward colony . Georgia had strayed from the original objectives , and its residents rarely paid attention to appointed administrators stationed in the province much less across the ocean . Even though Georgia ultimately succeeded as a colony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who distanced themselves from their mistake and became involved in other matters . <p> Oglethorpe refused to let this previous failure dampen his enthusiasm for helping the unfortunate and the empire , however . Upon his return to England , he was called into service to put down a rebellion in Scotland , and he continued to champion a wide variety of causes that fell within the bounds of the two themes of his career , including such issues as defending the pacifist principles of the Moravians , advocating a limit to a soldier 's tour of duty , and promoting the fishing industry . He also began to show more concern about his personal well-being as he reached middle age . He married Elizabeth Wright in September 1744 , and he increased and improved his estates for their comfort and enjoyment . He also cultivated friendships with important literary figures of the day including Samuel Johnson , Oliver Goldsmith , and many others who praised his previous work and admitted him into their exclusive social circle. ( n46 ) <p> One of these acquaintances , Granville Sharp , a noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reprint " The Sailors Advocate , " since little had changed in the lives of sailors over the years . Oglethorpe first contacted Sharp in 1776 to commend him for his antislavery stance , and the two corresponded often on this issue and others , and remained close friends until Oglethorpe 's death in 1785. ( n47 ) It was Sharp who undertook the publication of two later editions , presumably with Oglethorpe 's approval or even his assistance . Although he kept a busy schedule throughout his career , Oglethorpe never gave up on that first cause . Perhaps his several voyages across the Atlantic , as well as his reliance on the Royal Navy during the War of Jenkins ' Ear , especially in the failed siege of St. Augustine in 1740 , gave him increased respect for and awareness of the dismal situation of sailors . On trips from England transporting new settlers , Oglethorpe strictly regulated order , cleanliness , and rationing , resulting in little sickness or loss of life. ( n48 ) Having experienced shipboard life firsthand , he could now understand and appreciate more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his interest in their well-being . Moreover , his lack of personal gain from this endeavor shows his genuine regard for this problem . Oglethorpe had lost his seat in Parliament in 1754 , and since he no longer held an elected position , he had no need to gain the support of the people and yet he persisted with this matter throughout his lifetime . <p> " The Sailors Advocate " had already seen multiple printings throughout the eighteenth century as conditions in the navy failed to change or even moderate . The seventh and eighth editions , published in 1777 , maintained Oglethorpe 's exact text but included expanded introductions and appendices in order to attract more attention to the plight of abused mariners . Sharp opened these later versions with a scathing indictment of the administration because it refused to take any action against the evil and illegal procedure of impressment . He began by declaring : " This Thing of Pressing is a good Milch Cow to the Admiralty , " and he went on to explain that despite the Glorious Revolution , the Admiralty continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent fellows for naval service , thus equating itself with unlawful tyranny. ( n49 ) Because of this enduring exploitation , " this little Tract is now republished to keep up in the people of the present age the Knowledge and Spirit of their Predecessors . " ( n50 ) <p> Following the reprint of " The Sailors Advocate , " Sharp added four letters to reiterate his points . The first offered various solutions to the problems outlined in the previous document , thus answering Oglethorpe 's original concluding call " to induce others to communicate their thoughts to the Public , or , if they please , to send them to the Publisher of this Paper . " Entitled " A Letter from one who was bred in the Land-service , concerning a method for the more easy manning of the Navy " and signed by the traditional salutation " Your very humble Servant , " it could possibly be Oglethorpe 's response to his own request now that he had the time , influence , and experience to make such suggestions. ( n51 ) His service in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military administration and would have fulfilled the phrase " one who was bred in the Land-service . " Regardless of its authorship , the letter called for the Admiralty to assist each captain financially when it came to outfitting his ship with sailors so that a sizeable amount of bounty money would attract volunteers and prevent the need for resorting to impressment . The same author requested that sailors ' wives receive power of attorney in order to redeem their husbands ' tickets , allowing the family to access his wages . <p> The remaining letters described certain atrocious aspects of life at sea as a result of impressment . The second depicted the wretched conditions that pressed men endured immediately after their seizure . Soldiers kept the men in such a crowded situation that they could not sit down , and this environment " made them so hot , dirty , and faint , that there were often several of them sick , and some expiring . " Once transported to a larger holding ship , their condition further deteriorated since their numbers increased but neither their rations nor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for service on an outgoing ship , a term that could last days or even weeks . Another letter narrated the stoppage and seizure of several crew members of a merchant ship as it came into port , which " shews the abuse of pressing , and . was no great recommendation of our Country to the Foreigners who were in the vessel , to see men used in this manner like slaves , where liberty is so much talked of . " ( n52 ) <p> The final note documented an incident in which a Royal Navy ship halted a commercial vessel while it was underway , endangering the craft and its staff and leading to an armed scuffle between members of the two companies . Upon establishing order , the invading officers surveyed the crew for victims and seized a Quaker , whom they battered severely because he refused to remove his hat or to fight back because of his religious beliefs . After having their fun , they threatened and assaulted other personnel before going back to their own ship . Although charges were filed and the offending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and returned to his ship to continue his service . The Quaker , on the other hand , suffered from his injuries for three weeks before he died . Taken together , three of the letters narrate various abuses associated with impressment , abuses that would not have occurred if the institution had not been sanctioned by the Royal Navy . <p> While the seventh and eighth editions of " The Sailors Advocate " made legitimate arguments and reiterated Oglethorpe 's earlier assertions , their timing during the American War for Independence failed to encourage much reform . The subsequent wars with France increased the demand for sailors to defeat an age-old enemy once and for all . With the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 , the Royal Navy could finally stand down from the ready position that it had occupied for over a century , and with no want for sailors came no need for impressment . The policy died a quiet death never to be revived again. ( n53 ) <p> As for Oglethorpe , his work in Georgia represented the pinnacle of his career . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed interest in charitable and imperial matters , but he turned more attention to personal issues and activities in later years . Nonetheless , he never lost interest in the two themes that dominated his career , concern for the unfortunate and the British Empire , but he stepped out of the limelight and chose instead to work quietly behind the scenes . Although his achievements abroad far outshine his actions at home , modern scholars should not overlook or forget those early efforts since they formed the foundation of his entire life 's labors . This specific cause involving sailors ' rights helped to set him on the philanthropic path that would lead him to Georgia and therefore should receive more acknowledgment and appreciation . In those early days , " The Sailors Advocate " demonstrated one of his first attempts at reform , and while he may not have made much of a difference in sailors ' lives at the time , he refused to let their terrible situation go unnoticed . Failure to succeed should not overshadow the significance of this endeavor , especially since he continued his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always gain primary recognition as the founder of Georgia , but he deserves remembrance as a friend of British sailors as well , and both projects reflect his lifelong concerns for the poor and the empire .
