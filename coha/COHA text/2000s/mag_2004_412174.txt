ALICIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Off On Men , Love &; Fame " ( Jan. 2004 ) , I was truly amazed at how real Alicia is . It 's nice to see that a singer with so much talent , one who enjoys a great amount of fame , has n't let it go to her head . She 's happy with the simple things .

LEBRON JAMES The article , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Jan. 2004 ) , was great . I give the rookie a pat on his back because he 's so young , and he 's making something out of himself .

Thank you , EBONY , for this great article on LeBron James . Cornelia Nelson Florence , S. C , THE KING NOBODY KNOWS Thanks for the photo spread , " The Martin Luther King Jr .
