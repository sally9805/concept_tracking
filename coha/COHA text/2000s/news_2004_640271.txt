<p> White Europeans created the issue of race in America hundreds of years ago , along with its severe economic , social and class implications , when they dragged blacks here in shackles . And one cruel consequence that still manifests itself today is black-on-black prejudice . <p> When Tyee J. Tilghman attended school with other black kids for the first time , they called the light-skinned 14-year-old ' White Boy . ' As an adult , black strangers would confront him in public places with his white girlfriend , calling him a sellout . <p> When Edris Cooper-Anifowoshe was a student at Louisiana State University exploring a relationship with what she referred to as a ' redbone ' - a light-skinned black man with blue eyes - the couple would get harassed on the bus by black people . He finally left her with a note professing his love but saying they would never be accepted because of the way he looked . <p> Colorism is a new term to describe an old prejudice : the subjective ranking of black individuals according to the perceived color tones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , blacks of lighter tones have gained higher social status and greater economic opportunities than their darker brethren . It is the continuation of the persistent legacy of slavery , when blacks of mixed blood were given greater access to white privilege . And that favoritism can cause resentment in the reverse . <p> But colorism is not only about color . It is about the intersection of color with class , economics and education in America . <p> ' I just do n't think we are at the point where we can separate any of them , because color is intrinsic to the economic system that was set up to support slavery , ' said Cooper-Anifowoshe . She is the director of the Curious Theatre Company 's June 5 regional premiere of Dael Orlandersmith 's ' Yellowman , ' a coming-of-age love story between a dark-skinned black woman and a light-skinned black man . <p> Tilghman , who portrays the man , said when his schoolmates called him ' White Boy , ' it was not because of his coloring . ' It was because of the way I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King 's English , and that was n't accepted . That hurt me because I thought , ' What 's wrong with me being able to speak standard English ? ' When I look back on it , I think people in the black community were trying to hold me back from making myself better . ' <p> Cooper-Anifowoshe has spent much of the past year studying race , and she calls the stratifications that result a distinctly American creation . <p> ' For me , it harkens back to the first Americans who immigrated here and decided to close the country down to people who were different than they were , ' she said . ' They created race to keep privilege within a certain group of people - Northern Europeans . Any other culture was determined to be nonwhite . ' <p> In 1970 , author Ralph Ellison connected the white Europeans ' establishment of racial distinctions in America with the loss of their own identity upon immigration . <p> ' Since the beginning of this nation , white Americans have suffered from a deep inner uncertainty as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What America Would Be Like Without Blacks . ' ' One of the ways a has been to seize upon the presence of black Americans and use them as a marker , a symbol of limits . Many whites could look at the social position of blacks and feel that color formed an easy and reliable gauge for determining to what extent one was or was not American . ' <p> ' Even today , the terms ' white ' and ' black ' are largely American , ' Cooper-Anifowoshe said . ' Europeans have never identified themselves as ' white people . ' They identify themselves as Italians , French , Poles , German . And Africans certainly do not go around calling themselves ' black people . ' <p> ' I think it is very inherent to this culture . And I think it is important for everyone to know and embrace that , because we are the ones who are exporting the idea around the globe that this is important . ' <p> Pop-culture influences <p> The idea that a light-skinned black person is more palatable to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chat-room discussions on the subject cite the predominance of light-skinned black women in music videos . And when children 's toys feature black characters , they are almost always light-skinned . <p> Author Cornel West cites Michael Jackson 's pigmentation transformation as ' evidence of a rather pervasive self-loathing within the black professional class ' after a lifetime of exposure to white culture and values . <p> ' Black people must no longer view themselves through white lenses that devalue their African characteristics , ' West wrote in 1993 's ' Race Matters . ' ' Malcolm X claimed that black people will never value themselves as long as they subscribe to a standard of valuation that devalues them . ' <p> That is why for decades the prevailing standard of white beauty as dictated by ubiquitous media stereotypes has caused women to come to hate their own hair type , skin tone , nose and body shapes . <p> ' But that does n't just hit the African-American community , ' Cooper-Anifowoshe said . ' Jewish-Italian girls get nose jobs , and Mexican girls dye their hair blond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our society , and I still feel like people do n't want to deal with it as an issue , ' Tilghman said . ' It 's one of those things that is not really talked about , but it is very present , and it is something I do n't think is going to go away for a while . ' <p> But on that score , Cooper-Anifowoshe said , ' I do think there is a possibility it may go away , and interestingly enough , I think pop culture may be how it goes away . I see in pop culture today a new standard of beauty evolving in favor of the black woman . Look at all these extreme makeover shows . How many black women do you see on there trying to get light skin ? That 's not happening . Now you have all these ( white ) women tanning to the detriment of their health , and trying to get bigger lips , bigger butts and smaller noses . ' <p> Part of her hope for the future , she said , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore . <p> ' Our language is just so inadequate now , ' she said . ' To you , I am a dark-skinned black woman , but to my husband , I am light-skinned . My blood is made up of Irish , Nigerian , Cherokee , Choctaw , Chickasaw and a bit of Chinese . So for me to even call myself black at all is so inaccurate , and for me to call myself American means nothing , either . <p> ' When you turn on the TV , you ca n't always tell who 's what anymore . Who 's black ? Who 's Arab ? America is going through this confusion now . And the more global we become , the more we will see how this labeling is just our specific American pettiness . ' <p> So how would she describe herself ? <p> ' Oh , just call me a brown , braided , colored country girl , ' she said with a laugh . <p> ' Yellowman ' cometh <p> Curious has gathered a national team to present ' Yellowman , ' which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was recommended to Curious through her work with the San Francisco Mime Troupe ; Tilghman played his role for the Arena Stage in Washington , D.C. ; and co-star Candace Taylor is a veteran of the Colorado Shakespeare Festival . <p> The play delves into family racial prejudices but explores other issues that , like colorism , run much deeper than color , such as alcoholism , body size and definitions of beauty . <p> ' I do not think the totality of this play lies in its color issues . The play takes all these volatile issues and personalizes them in a way that treats their complexities with a great deal of tenderness and respect , ' Cooper-Anifowoshe said . ' For me , this is a love story about people breaking out of their past and bettering themselves . ' <p> The team is eager to perform the work for a Denver audience , even though the population of the city is only 11.1 percent black . <p> ' I do n't know where you go and do theater in America where you have a black audience , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . But I do n't want you to think that because you are not black that race is n't your issue . <p> ' It is .
