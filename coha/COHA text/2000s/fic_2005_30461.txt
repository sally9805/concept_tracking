Holy Skirts Chapter One Berlin 1904 Elsa had never been like the other girls she knew , modest and squeamish about their bodies . Men seemed to sense this . When she was twelve , the doctor , while examining her , had winked and pinched her breasts , and she had been stunned at the sweet stars of pain there , the moist heat between her legs . She had been infatuated with him for weeks , inventing fevers and asking him about his ornithology prints on the examining-room wall . Then there had been the fisherman 's son who met her twice at a certain spot in the woods and , laying her down in the leaves , had let her touch his penis , the little eye with its crumpled pink hood . It amused her the way it stiffened and grew in her hand as if she had commanded it with a spell , and when the semen spilled on her arm , it felt like tears . There was the shy milk boy , whom she took behind the house to a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when she put his hand under her skirt , on her thighs above her stockings , he pushed her up against the tines of a rake , but she did not mind . She had a theory that she simply had more heat in her limbs , more blood than most girls , and sensitive skin ( she was also prone to hives and blushes ) , and so her body 's chemistry gave her these pleasures other girls were not so lucky to feel . At home she had been warned about the sailors who roamed the streets near the marina , that they were dangerous and wily . And so at night she would put on her red chemise and imagine them climbing through her bedroom window , one by one . They would admire her , touch her pale skin , slip a thumb beneath the strap on her shoulder , keeping their voices low so that no one would hear . She fantasized about being kidnapped by a sailor with green eyes and sunburned skin . As he was taking her off to China or India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pygmies , about the monkey 's brains and grasshoppers he had eaten . The ocean would spread ahead of them in its dark infinity , the moon winking , as he slipped his hand inside the secret spot where her bodice met the chemise . She finally lost her virginity one night on a rowboat with a boy who smelled of salt and grunted into her hair . The boat rocked , and water splashed over them . Afterward she put her hand in the cool sea and , opening her fingers , imagined her virginity floating away like a lock of hair in the waves . When she stepped off the hot train , after the five-hour ride from Swinemnde to Berlin , she realized she had no idea where to go . It was a gray day in January , the air cold and still . As Elsa wandered the streets , her duffel bag slung over her shoulder , she kept an eye out for landmarks from her earlier visits  --  that giant pockmarked door that opened onto a courtyard of discarded wheels , the candy shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark cathedral with its low , despairing bells but found herself on a strange street of vegetable carts and stores selling pots and pans . She was nineteen years old , tall and long-limbed . In a hat that fell low on her brow , she walked with a gangly abruptness that made her skirt appear to stop and then start again suddenly , sweeping the pavement in odd bursts of movement . People rushed past her , their faces pressed into mufflers and coat lapels , and on the street smoky plumes rose up from the horses ' nostrils . She had not thought it would be so difficult to find a place to stay the night , having imagined she would stay at the Bristol Hotel , where she had always stayed before with her mother , but now she could n't find it . When her fingers turned numb and her nose was running , she hurried into a caf , the door 's bells clattering after her . Green and red bottles behind the bar gleamed , and the air smelled of licorice . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Down that way , " the woman said , pointing toward the church . " Is Frau Hoffman 's . She might have a room . " Elsa went to the address and knocked on the door of a tall , narrow house with pointed eaves . Elsa had assumed she could survive for a year or more on the money she had brought . She also had her notebook , three books of poetry , an extra dress , her favorite yellow shoes , and that last gift from her mother , which she did n't have a name for yet  --  all that she could fit in the bag when she climbed out the window of her bedroom and ran for the train . She was shocked when Frau Hoffman asked for almost all the money remaining in her purse . " For the first month 's rent . " Her loose cheeks flapped like dog ears around her mouth , but her face turned hard when she spoke of money . " And after this , always on the first Friday . " She showed Elsa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a chipped washstand . The bedspread was gray with city ash . " You 'll share the toilet and bath with the two others on this floor  --  they 're nice girls , seamstresses . " In the parlor , crowded with dark furniture and black-faced china dolls , Frau Hoffman sat in a chair with a high back like a throne . She took Elsa 's money and put it in an envelope that she sealed . " Now , do n't tell me where you go at night . If someone comes looking for you , I do n't want to have to lie . " Elsa 's throat clenched . She had never known a woman as old as Frau Hoffman who did not watch girls , waiting for them to make a mistake . " No one will be looking for me . " She tried not to think of her father 's threats ...
