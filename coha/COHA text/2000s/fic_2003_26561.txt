Ruby Holler Chapter One The Silver Bird Dallas leaned far out of the window , his eyes fixed on a bird flying lazily in the distance . Sun slanted through the clouds above , as if a spotlight were aimed on the bird . A silver bird , Dallas thought . A magical silver bird . The bird turned suddenly , veering south over the small town of Boxton , toward the faded yellow building and the window from which Dallas leaned . Dallas stretched his arm out . Here ! he called . Over here ! The bird swooped toward him and then rose up over the building , high , high into the air , over the alley and the train tracks and the dried-up creek . Dallas watched it rise on the air currents over one brown hill and then another , until it disappeared . He tried to follow it in his mind . He imagined it flying on until it spied a narrow green valley , a scooped-out basin with a creek looping and winding its way through the center . He pictured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hills , to this place where cool breezes drifted through the trees , and where the creek was so clear that every stone on its bottom was visible . Maybe the silver bird had flown home . Get out of that window ! a voice shouted from below . No leaning out of windows ! Dallas leaned a little farther out and called down to Mr. Trepid . Did you see that silver bird ? Get out of that window , or you 're going to join your sister down here pulling weeds , Mr. Trepid threatened . Dallas spotted his sister , Florida , inching her way along the sidewalk , wrenching clumps of weeds and grass and dirt from the ground . Putrid weeds , Florida snarled , heaving a clod of dirt over her shoulder . Dallas watched as the clod landed on Mr. Trepid 's back and as the man scuttled over to Florida and whacked her on the head . Dallas wished the silver bird would return and snare Mr. Trepid and carry him high up over the town and then drop him , splat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
