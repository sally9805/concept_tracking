Most people see buildings as things made of steel and glass , wood and stone . Steven Holl sees them first as things made of space and light . Just as the Moors cultivated the trickle of water everywhere in their desert palaces , Holl , who grew up in the cloudy Pacific Northwest , designs buildings that cherish and supervise every sunbeam . Light gathers in the alcoves of his Bellevue Art Museum in Washington State . It sweeps across the arcs of his Museum of Contemporary Art in Helsinki . It pulses through colored glass in his Chapel of St. Ignatius in Seattle , a building he once described as " seven bottles of light in a stone box . " <P> Holl 's other signatures ? One is a unique husbandry of space . Each building is not so much a discrete object as a complicated succession of vistas . He called his plan for the Helsinki museum " Chiasma , " a Greek word for " intertwining . " That describes how the museum 's curving outer section enfolds a straighter-lined companion structure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement by which his intricate design reaches out to the surrounding streets . Moving among the museum 's 25 galleries , visitors wind between the two portions and upward toward a concluding level of  --  what else ?  --  sunlight . <P> Holl , who teaches and practices in New York City , is famous too for a fine-fibered sense of materials . One of his organizing principles he describes as " the stone and the feather , " that being his notion of how weight and weightlessness are best understood in the presence of each other . You understand them better yourself at the Chapel of St. Ignatius , where thin sheets of zinc roofing meet rough concrete walls along knife-edged junctures . The heft of the concrete accentuates the fine metal , which reciprocates by pointing up the raw mass of the heavier material . <P> All of Holl 's principles and intuitions have culminated in his plan for a major addition to the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City , Mo. , scheduled for completion in 2004 . This time he comes as close as possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wells , " translucent structures strewn across the museum grounds like giant crystal boxes , each of them admitting sunlight to galleries underground . <P> After decades of played-out Modernist formulas and goofy PostModern replies , we have entered a moment of exciting American architecture . Richard Meier has refined the rules of Modernism to high brilliance . Frank Gehry has exploded those same rules to make some of the great buildings of our time . Why should Holl , at 53 , be counted the best of them all ? Because his buildings epitomize an architecture alert to emotional needs and the spiritual properties of space . Because he conforms his designs so adroitly to their surroundings . Because he knows how to speak through understatement . For all those reasons , his work is more than beautiful . It 's illuminating .
