Events as vast and unwieldy as the war in Iraq often hit home hardest when seen through the experience of a single person . In last week 's issue , TIME ran a photograph of a young boy named Ali Ismail Abbas , who had suffered excruciating burns and the loss of both arms after a missile hit his home in a southern suburb of Baghdad . It was not known whether any of Ali 's family members had survived ; the only relative tending to him at the al Kindi hospital was an aunt . The photo of the armless boy evoked distress and concern from readers around the world . <P> What has happened to him since ? Yuri Kozyrev , the photographer who took the picture , and TIME correspondent Alex Perry went to the al Kindi hospital last week to check on Ali , but it was closed . Looting and disorder in Baghdad had forced doctors to move Ali and other critically injured patients . Our journalists found him at a hospital in Saddam City , a neighborhood in eastern Baghdad , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singed lungs , Ali , 12 , indicated that he may have surviving family members . He said his parents are divorced and his father and stepmother are still alive , though no one knows how to reach them . Ali said that under Saddam Hussein it was difficult for his family to earn a living , but there were moments of joy , as when the family went to the park on feast days and played soccer . <P> He recounted how one night , just after midnight , a missile dropped from the sky onto the home where he and his mother , stepfather , brother and six sisters were sleeping . " The house collapsed , " he says . " My mother was dead , my stepfather was dead , my brother , dead . My mother was pregnant . " Ali believes some of his sisters may have escaped . <P> As a result of his burns , Ali is suffering from septicemia , which is spreading toxic bacteria through his body . His condition should be treated in a sterilized location , but Ali lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towel suspended over his chest . His nurse says the boy is quiet when he 's alone and never cries out in pain . " He just wants to go outside Iraq to get treatment , " she says . " And he just wants to see his sisters . " In the calmest of times , it would be difficult to treat a boy in Ali 's condition in Iraq , but the current chaos has made it impossible for aid organizations to get medicine to hospitals . Ali 's doctor says the boy is in danger of dying within weeks . It 's hard to imagine something more emblematic of Iraq 's humanitarian needs than a young boy simply running out of time . <P> James Kelly , Managing Editor
