The recent outbreaks of violence and threats of violence in schools have forced parents and kids to face an uncomfortable truth : sometimes it is necessary to " tattle . " From the time our kids start talking , most of us parents discourage them from reporting on the everyday indignities they suffer at the hands of hair-pulling sisters , obnoxious little brothers or backyard bullies . We want our kids to be strong and learn to handle situations without our intervention . We do n't want our kids to tattle . Except , of course , when they should . <P> Violence-prevention experts agree that parents should begin educating their children starting around age 5 on the difference between " tattling " and " telling . " Tattling is telling on someone in order to get him in trouble . Telling is reporting about someone to get him help . <P> Of course , it 's easier to state the distinction than to get kids to understand or trust it . Young children , especially , often fear that if they tell on another kid , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents need to keep their cool to show children that they can be safely confided in . Once a young child brings information home , a parent must handle it with other grownups  --  taking it out of the child 's hands . The act of telling is hard enough ; parents should n't further burden kids by asking them to fix things too . <P> Parents should continue the conversation about telling through elementary school , when children are most eager to talk and listen to their parents . Good conversation starters are open-ended questions like " What did you think when you saw that happen ? " Role playing can help : " If a friend told you he was going to do something scary , what would you do ? " <P> A study just released by the Kaiser Family Foundation shows a disturbing chasm between parents and kids about just how effective family talks can be . Even though 66% of parents of eight-to-11-year-olds said they had talked to their kids about guns in school , only half of their children remembered having such a conversation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids learn that difficult subjects can be freely and easily discussed at home . <P> With middle or high schoolers , parents need to avoid two danger zones : the " freak out " and the " big talk . " Sixty-one percent of teens in the Kaiser study said they do n't confide in their parents because they do n't want to worry them . Parents need to demonstrate that they can listen to their kids without judging them and answer questions calmly and without lecturing . The car is a good place to talk with teens because it is n't too face to face . Parents should n't wait for their children to take the lead . Adults can use recent events as a jumping-off point but should talk about telling even when it is n't in the news . <P> Once you urge your child to " tell , " the burden is on you to believe him , and if he comes home with news of kids ' talking about harming themselves or others , take it seriously , even if it is buried in an account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who overheard a kid in the locker room saying some stupid things . " Kids also appreciate it when parents confide their own stories . If you dealt with issues such as violence and bullying as a teen , tell your kids about it . If it starts a conversation , your family could have had the " big talk " without anyone 's even realizing it .
