I customarily use the December column to gaze back on my year in adventure , much the way I was constantly craning my neck to look behind me last August during the 24 Hours of Tahoe , a mountain-bike relay race . That way I had a better idea of who was about to pass me. // I had n't initially intended to race . I was at the Northstar ski resort in Lake Tahoe , Calif. , to do some reporting in advance of the Honda 24 Hours of Moab ( SI , Oct. 20 ) . At Northstar , I met Tom McCarty and Todd Morrish , who were competing in Tahoe and were looking for a third member for their bike team , Grateful Tread . Another racer , a very cool guy named Keith Bontrager , loaned me a sweet ride . The next thing I knew , I was off on my first 11-mile loop . // After climbing about 1,600 feet , all the while drowning out birdsong from the valley with the sound of my ragged breathing ( the race started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased to see the course level out . Now I 'd make up time . Or so I thought . I took too much speed into a double jump  --  sorry about that , Keith  --  and flew over the handlebars going about 20 mph. // I flipped and came to rest alongside the trail , having scraped a good portion of skin off my back and my right buttock . Four months later those scars remain as vivid as my memory of lying awake in the team 's tent at 3:30 the following morning , 45 minutes before the start of my fourth , and penultimate , lap . I wanted to be in my own bed . I wanted a little plastic bottle of prescription painkillers . I wanted my mother . From the sleeping bag on my left came the voice of McCarty , whom I 'd known less than a day . // " Having fun ? " he asked . // It was as hard as I laughed at 3:30 a.m. all year . // It was a year that featured fewer assignments on the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work to trade places with my wife , Laura , who took the opportunity to concentrate on her freelance writing career . Aside from some minor glitches  --  the day I lost track of my six-year-old son for a few hours and had to call the police , for instance  --  my tenure as Mr. Mom went swimmingly . ( Shameless Plug Dept. : How Tough Could It Be ? , my book on the travails of this stay-at-home dad , will be published in May . ) Laura did greenlight one prolonged , sweaty outing , granting me permission to do the Appalachian Extreme , a three-day adventure race in Maine and New Hampshire . // My mates and I on Team King Oscar occupied last place at one point , but rallied to finish in the top half ( SI Adventure , June 16 ) . I had no inkling , flying home , that the toughest days of my week lay ahead . // On the calendar the family camping trip had looked like a relaxing idyll . We would motor south from our home in San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There , with our friends and their two children , we would commune with the majestic trees  --  we would slow the pace of our lives . That was the plan . // Then Saturday rolled around , and it became clearer to me why Laura loathes camping . It fell to Mr. Mom to plan menus for 3 ? days , shop for food , pack for kids , pack for self , pack car and then  --  upon arrival at campsite  --  unpack everything . That done , I helped unpack my friend 's truck ( five trips , but who 's counting ? ) while he stood in the campsite chatting up my wife . What else ? Pitch tent , finish pitching second tent that wife and daughter had given up on , cook , serve dinner , scrape and wash dishes and silverware , dry same . // While scrubbing hardened marsh-mallow off my children 's faces that night ( do n't get me started on how overrated s'mores are ) , I concluded that , next to the sustained , grueling servitude of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the park . // After breakfast on the final morning of the trip it was decided that the children would do the dishes . It was a Gong Show . While arguing over which one of them would man the spigot , they created a fair-sized wetland for migrating waterfowl but cleaned no dishes . Banishing them , I took over . // While performing this chore , my thoughts drifted to Team King Oscar 's last hours on the Androscoggin River six nights earlier . The final leg of our race had been a nocturnal , hypothermia-inducing 24-mile paddle . True , it was warm at this campsite , but at least in Maine there was a damn finish line .
