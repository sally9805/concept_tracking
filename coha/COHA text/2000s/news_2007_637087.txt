<p> At least twice in UPS ' century-long history , the delivery giant has pushed for big opportunities in the nation 's neighborhoods . <p> The first was roughly 90 years ago , when founder Jim Casey refocused the Seattle-based messenger company to make deliveries for local department stores . Workers in Model T 's ferried purchases to shoppers ' homes , combining stops in neighborhoods to make deliveries more efficient . <p> Now , the second big push is on . <p> The continued boom in online shopping and the rise of at-home work have shifted the businesses of Sandy Springs-based UPS and rival FedEx . <p> Business-to-business shipments are still the bulk of deliveries UPS and FedEx handle in the U.S. and around the world . But both companies have added services to snag more business in America 's neighborhoods , though their strategies differ . <p> UPS recently unveiled a program that lets customers go online to intercept packages already en route , for a fee of $10 . UPS predicts among the biggest beneficiaries will be online retailers who can yank back products being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And last summer , the company launched a call-ahead service to notify residents when to expect deliveries . <p> Home delivery will only get bigger for deliverers , predicts package services consultant Doug Caldwell of Orem , Utah-based ParcelPool.com . " They are trying to figure out how to deal with it . " <p> Ten years ago , 20 percent of the packages UPS delivered in the U.S. went to homes . Now , 30 percent do . That amounted to close to 1 billion residential packages last year . <p> FedEx declines to disclose specifics on the size of its residential volume . But last year , home deliveries continued to lead package growth for FedEx Ground , a business with significantly higher profit margins than the express side , according to the company 's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission . <p> And while the company sees a slowing economy cutting into overall profit expectations , it said this year 's revenue growth on the ground side will be powered by home deliveries . <p> " It 's the fastest-growing segment in our business , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ground 's senior vice president for terminal operations . <p> Higher costs <p> UPS and FedEx face some of the same basic challenges . One of the biggest : Dispatching truck drivers to navigate mazes of residential streets costs more on average than business-to-business deliveries , industry consultants say . <p> The crucial measure is delivery density : how close delivery stops are and how many packages are dropped off at each stop . A single store or office might receive numerous boxes a day , as would the office or store next door . But in the residential world , FedEx or UPS might have only one or two stops on a street , halting their trucks to drop off perhaps a single parcel at a home . <p> Packages may ship across the country , says Caldwell , the consultant , but " for any carrier the greatest individual expense is the last mile . " <p> Online retailers are under pressure to ship purchases faster and cheaper . <p> Plenty of large online companies have successfully negotiated discounted shipping rates with carriers , says industry consultant Satish Jindel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very attractive " for UPS and FedEx . <p> FedEx has a rate structure for home delivery that tends to be higher than the fees for business packages . <p> UPS adds a surcharge for residential : $1.80 for ground deliveries and $2.20 for air . Other UPS surcharges for remote deliveries are higher for homes than they are for businesses . <p> Neither FedEx nor UPS officials interviewed would comment on how profit margins differ between home and business deliveries . But in a report issued last month , Bear , Stearns &; Co. analyst Edward Wolfe suggested that residential is " slightly less profitable " for UPS . <p> Higher demands <p> There are other distinctions . <p> Packages sent to homes tend to be lighter than other deliveries , which means they generate less revenue on average because carriers ' rates are tied to weight . <p> Residential customers tend to be more demanding than business ones , says FedEx 's Mannion . And they often are n't home to accept packages . <p> That 's a problem because profits can disappear when drivers have to make repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UPS ' , which allows drivers to drop off most residential deliveries on door stoops , near garages or other spots unless customers pay extra to require signatures from the receiver . In the industry , Caldwell said , it 's been called " ding-dong and dump . " <p> But UPS and FedEx diverge in other ways . <p> Most of UPS ' drivers make deliveries to both businesses and homes , usually working Monday through Friday . <p> In 2000 , Memphis-based FedEx created a separate home delivery service as part of Pittsburgh-based FedEx Ground . Drivers are independent contractors , work Tuesday through Saturday to catch some residents at home on weekends , and make deliveries later into the evening than most UPS drivers do . <p> The service had losses of more than $100 million its first three years , according to FedEx regulatory disclosures . But the company says the service has been profitable in recent years . <p> Deliverers are fine-tuning their residential business . <p> FedEx charges extra fees for consumers to get delivery within a two-hour time window or to have a box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And UPS now offers automated phone calls notifying consumers about pending deliveries . That cut the need to make additional delivery attempts by more than 15 percent , said Kurt Kuehn , the company 's senior vice president of worldwide sales and marketing . <p> UPS intends to become a bigger part of the neighborhood , Kuehn said . " This is a business we want , " he said . " There is no question . " <p> SHIFTING BUSINESS <p> Percentage of UPS ' U.S. domestic volume  --  Commercial vs. residential : <p> ... Commercial ...
