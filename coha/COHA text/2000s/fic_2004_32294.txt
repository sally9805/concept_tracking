Mac McCullum scanned the Petra perimeter with high-powered field glasses . Rayford should have reached him by now . Mac 's watch showed 1300 hours-one in the afternoon , Carpathia Time . It had to be more than a hundred degrees Fahrenheit . Sweat ran down his neck from the grayish red hair peeking out from under his cap , soaking his shirt . Mac detected not even a wisp of wind and wondered what his freckled , leathery face would look like in a few days . Without taking his eyes from the lenses , Mac unholstered his phone and punched in the connection to Chang Wong in the computer center . " Where 's Ray ? " " I was about to ask you , " Chang said . " He left here forty-five minutes ago , and no one else has seen him either . " " What do we hear from Buck ? " Mac noticed the hesitation . " Nothing new . " " Since when ? " " Uh , Rayford heard from him late this morning . " " And ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What 're you sayin ' , Chang ? " " Nothing . " " I gathered . What 's wrong ?

" If you wo n't tell me , I 'll call him myself . " " Buck ? " " Well , who else ? " " I 've tried . My sensor shows his phone inoperable . " " Turned off ? " " Unlikely , Mr. McCullum . " " Well , I should guess so . Malfunctioning ? Damaged ? " " I 'm hoping the former , sir . " " Global Positioning System active , at least ? " " No , sir .

He felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was as if his mind raced as his heart ached for the greatest event in the history of the cosmos . The old man 's senior advisers , a half-dozen elders , sat with him deep in the stone compound of Petra . Eleazar Tiberias , a broad globe of a man , offered that the million-plus pilgrims under their charge " are clearly as restless as we . Is there nothing we can tell them ? " " I have an activity in mind , " Chaim said . " But what would you have me say ? " " I am newer to this than you , Rabbi , but- " " Please , " Chaim said , raising a hand . " Reserve such a title for Dr. Ben-Judah . I am merely a student , thrust into this- " " Nonetheless , " Eleazar continued , " I sense the populace is as eager as I to know the exact moment of Messiah 's return . I mean , if it is , as you and Dr. Ben-Judah have for so long taught , seven years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does that mean it will be to the minute ? I recall the signing being at around four in the afternoon , Israel time , seven years ago today . " Chaim smiled . " I have no idea . I do know this : God has His own economy of time . Do I believe Messiah will return today ? Yes . Will it trouble me if He does not appear until tomorrow ? No . My faith will not be shaken . But I expect Him soon . " " And this activity you mentioned ? " " Yes , something to occupy the minds of the people while we wait . I came across a videodisc of a dramatic sermon from before the turn of the century by an African-American preacher , long since in heaven , of course . I propose calling the people together and showing it . " " The Lord may come while it is playing , " an elder said . " So much the better . " " There remain unbelievers among us , " Eleazar said . Chaim shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it also fulfills prophecy . There are those who enjoy the safety of Petra , even many who believe Jesus was the most influential person who ever lived , who have not yet put their faith in Him . They do not recognize Him as the long-awaited Messiah , and they have not acknowledged Him as their Savior . This sermon is also evangelistic . Perhaps many of the undecided will take their stand before Messiah appears . " " Better than waiting until the event itself , " someone said . " Gather the people for a two-o'clock showing , " Chaim said , rising . " And let 's close in prayer . " " Begging your pardon , " Eleazar said , " but do you feel the absence of Dr. Ben-Judah as keenly as I do ? " " More than you know , Eleazar . Let 's pray for him right now , and I will call him in a few minutes . I would love to share his greeting with the people and hear what has been happening in Jerusalem . " Mac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sun , perhaps a mile from his position . Oh no . A red fuel tank and a tire looked very much like parts from Rayford 's all-terrain vehicle . Mac tried to steady his hands as he panned in a wide arc , looking for signs of his friend . It appeared the ATV could have been hit by a heat-seeking missile or smashed to bits by tumbling . Perhaps , he thought , no sign of Rayford nearby was good news . Mac raised Chang again . " Sorry to be a nuisance , " he said , " but what does your sensor say about Ray 's phone ? " " I was afraid you 'd ask . It 's inoperable too , but its GPS is still pulsing . My screen shows it deep in a narrow crevasse a little over forty-five hundred feet below you . " " I 'm heading down there . " " Wait , Mr. McCullum . " " What ? " " I 've got a lens pointed that way , and there 's no room in the opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone ? " " No , but I know it 's there . It can be the only thing there . The opening is too narrow for anything else . " " So have you seen his ATV too ? " " I 'm looking . " " Well , I have . If that phone is due south of me , look about twenty degrees east . " " Hang on I see it . " " But no sign of Ray , Chang . I 'm going to look . " " Sir ? Could you send someone else ? " " Why ? I 'm twiddling my thumbs here . Big Dog One has the troops under control . " " Frankly , I 'd rather you go to Jerusalem . " " You gon na tell me what 's goin ' on ? " " Come see me , Mr. McCullum . I was honoring the confidence of Captain Steele , but I think you-and Dr. Rosenzweig-should know . " Mac arrived at the tech center , deep in the bowels of Petra , a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him while Chang acknowledged him with a look but kept turning back to his numerous screens . Finally Chang pulled away and the three sat , far from the ears of others . Mac noticed , however , that many techies and others frequently stole glances in their direction . " There 's no delicate way to say this , " Chang began . " Captain Steele told Naomi and me this morning that Mr. Williams had told him that Dr. Ben-Judah was killed in the fighting at Jerusalem . " Mac stiffened . Chaim buried his face in his hands . " I hope he did not suffer terribly , " the old man said . " With Captain Steele missing now and- " " What ? Him too ? " Chaim said . " And I am unable to raise Cameron on the phone " " I felt you both should know . I mean , I know this may all be moot by this time tomorrow . " " Perhaps even by four this afternoon , " Chaim said . " The question now is what to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do , " Mac said . " I 've got Abdullah Smith looking for Ray . Chang here thinks I ought to go to Jerusalem . " Chaim looked up in apparent surprise . " I do , " Chang said . " From the looks of what 's left of his vehicle and his phone , odds are all Mr. Smith is going to find are Captain Steele 's remains . I 'm sorry to be so blunt . " " But a flight to Jerusalem now ? " Chaim said . " Just to see whether Cameron- " " It 's what I would want if it was me , " Mac said . " I know he may be dead , and either way , Jesus is comin ' , but with Tsion gone , I 'd just as soon get Buck outa there and back here with us . " " Even for as little as an hour , " Chaim said , more a statement than a question . " Like I say , that 's what I 'd want . " " And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minutes later , Mac was in Gus Zuckermandel 's quarters . He filled in the young man on his plans . " And here 's the hard part , Zeke . I want to leave in ten minutes . " " Can you give me twenty ? " " Fifteen . " " Deal . " " What 've you got , Z ? " Mac said , as the forger yanked open a file drawer , riffled through several folders , and slapped one open on his desk . " Your new identity , " Zeke said , moving to a closet , which he opened with a flourish . There were two dozen black-on-black Global Community Unity Army uniforms , from tinted eye-shield helmets to calf-length boots . " Find one that fits while I 'm working on your documents . Do n't forget the gloves . Nobody 's checking for marks of loyalty anymore anyway , but just to be safe . " " How do you do this , Z ? " Mac said , approaching garments that looked his size . " With lots of help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em , and I got me a little crew that runs out and gathers up their stuff-papers , clothes , and all . " " Weapons ? " " ' Course . " When Mac emerged with the uniform a perfect fit , he found Zeke mixing some sort of a brew . " You look good , Mac , " he said . " Problem is , you got to be black . " " And you can manage that in a few minutes ? " " If you 're game . " " Whatever it takes . " Mac whipped off his helmet , jacket , shirt , and gloves . Zeke used the mix to paint him dark brown from the shoulders to the hairline . " Keep the helmet on , " ' cause I have n't got time to make the hair authentic . " " Check . " " And let 's do your hands , just in case . " Zeke dyed Mac 's skin from mid-forearm to fingertips . " This should dry in two and a half minutes . Then an instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my best to Buck and Tsion . " Mac hesitated . " You betcha . Zeke , you 're a genius . " The younger man snorted . " Just here to serve . " Mac was sprinting to a chopper when he reached Abdullah Smith by phone . " Nothing yet , Mac . I will let you know as soon as I discover anything . " As Mac lifted off , he saw multitudes streaming from all corners of Petra and gathering at the central meeting place . Chaim was alarmed at the mood of the throng . It was the biggest crowd he had ever drawn at Petra , and it was noisy , clearly preoccupied , antsy . He heard nervous laughter , saw lots of embracing . When one or two would look to the skies , hundreds-sometimes thousands-would do likewise . " My beloved brothers and sisters in Messiah , " he began , " as well as the seekers and undecided among us . Please try to quiet yourselves and settle for a moment . Please ! I know we all expect the imminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of no greater privilege than to have Him appear as we speak . But- " He was interrupted by thunderous applause and cheering . Chaim gestured that they should be seated . " I share your enthusiasm ! And while I know that there will be nothing else on your minds until He comes , I thought there might be value in focusing specifically on Him this afternoon . I know there remain among us many who are withholding their decisions about Him until He appears . Consider this my last effort to persuade you not to wait . We do not know what may befall us at that moment , whether God will allow scoffers and mockers and rejecters to change their minds . Pray He will not harden your heart due to your rebellion or unbelief . Surely there has been more than enough evidence than anyone could need to reveal the truth of God 's plan . " While we watch and wait , consider the thoughts of a great preacher from decades past . His name was Dr. Shadrach Meshach Lockridge , and his message is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disc to play , and it was projected off two white walls of smooth stone , each several stories high , where all could see it . The sound system carried it to the ends of the seated masses . Lockridge proved to be animated and thunderous , interrupting his own cadence of shouts and growls with whispers and huge smiles . The disc caught him near the end of his sermon , and he was picking up steam . " The Bible says my king is a seven-way king . He 's the king of the Jews ; that 's a racial king . He 's the king of Israel ; that 's a national king . He 's the king of righteousness . He 's the king of the ages . He 's the king of heaven . He 's the king of glory . He 's the king of kings . Besides being a seven-way king , He 's the Lord of lords . That 's my king . Well , I wonder , do you know Him ? " Hundreds of thousands applauded , and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " David said , ' The heavens declare the glory of God , and the firmament showeth His handiwork . ' My king is a sovereign king . No means of measure can define His limitless love . No far-seeing telescope can bring into visibility the coastline of His shoreless supply . No barrier can hinder Him from pouring out His blessings . " He 's enduringly strong . He 's entirely sincere . He 's eternally steadfast . He 's immortally graceful . He 's infinitely powerful . He 's impartially merciful . Do you know Him ? " Many shouted their agreement . " He 's the greatest phenomenon that has ever crossed the horizon of this world . He 's God 's Son . He 's the sinner 's Savior . He 's the centerpiece of civilization . He stands in the solitude of Himself . He 's honest and He 's unique . He 's unparalleled . He 's unprecedented . " He is the loftiest idea in literature . He 's the highest personality in philosophy . He is the supreme problem in higher criticism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the core , the necessity for spiritual religion . He 's the miracle of the ages . Yes , He is . He 's the superlative of everything good that you choose to call Him . He 's the only one qualified to be our all-sufficiency . I wonder if you know Him today . " As the preacher continued , more and more listeners stood , some raising their hands , others shouting agreement , others nodding . " He supplies strength for the weak . He 's available for the tempted and tried . He sympathizes and He saves . He strengthens and sustains . He guards and He guides . He heals the sick . He cleanses the leper . He forgives the sinner . He discharges debtors . He delivers the captive . He defends the feeble . He blesses the young . He serves the unfortunate . He regards the aged . He rewards the diligent . And he beautifies the meek . I wonder if you know Him . " Well , this is my king . He 's the key to knowledge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorway of deliverance . He 's the pathway of peace . He 's the roadway of righteousness . He 's the highway of holiness . He 's the gateway of glory . Do you know Him ? " Well , His office is manifold . His promise is sure . His life is matchless . His goodness is limitless . His mercy is everlasting . His love never changes . His word is enough . His grace is sufficient . His reign is righteous . His yoke is easy and His burden is light . I wish I could describe Him to you . " That elicited an ocean of laughter and more applause . The same had happened with his original audience , and Lockridge had paused , allowing it to fade before he continued . " He 's indescribable . He 's incomprehensible . He 's invincible . He 's irresistible . Well , you ca n't get Him out of your mind . You ca n't get Him off of your hand . You ca n't outlive Him and you ca n't live without Him . The Pharisees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stop Him . Pilate could n't find any fault in Him . Herod could n't kill Him . Death could n't handle Him , and the grave could n't hold Him . That 's my king ! " Everyone was standing now , hands raised , many applauding , shouting , some dancing . " And Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever and ever and ever ! How long is that ? And ever and ever ! And when you get through with all the forevers , then amen ! Good God Almighty ! Amen ! " By the time Mac found himself within sight of the rocky Judean hills where Jerusalem lay smoking in the early afternoon sun , he had begun to despair of finding Buck . If he was all right , would he not have borrowed a phone to check in ? The latest intelligence from Chang was that Buck had reported Tsion 's death to Rayford from inside the Old City . Though the colossal armies of the world-now amalgamated into Carpathia 's Global Community Unity Army-stretched by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clear from the air that the current major offensive focused on the Old City . Mac looked for a place to land . He had to look like a GC officer on assignment and head on foot to the Old City as if he knew what he was doing . In fact , he did n't have a clue . The Old City was only a third of a mile square . And if he found Buck alive , what was he to do ? Arrest him and muscle him to the chopper ? Finding Buck dead or alive , Mac decided , would be like discovering a patch of dry ground in the Louisiana bayou . Mac 's phone chirped , and he saw it was Chang . " Give me some good news . " " Such as ? " " Such as Buck 's dead phone all of a sudden started showin ' his position . " " No such luck . But I do have something . Carpathia 's on the rampage about the destruction of New Babylon , and he 's taking heat from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everybody who depended on New Babylon is crying over the loss . I 'm picking up televised reports from everywhere of leaders , diplomats , businessmen-you name it-literally weeping , decrying what 's become of New Babylon and their own interests . Some are committing suicide right on camera . " " No way the GC is puttin ' that stuff on the air . " " No , they are n't , but yours truly still has his ways . " " Attaboy , Chang , but how does that help me find Buck ? " " You 're not going to find Buck , Mr. McCullum . " " What ? You know that for sure ? " " I 'm just stating the obvious . " " Ye of little faith . " " Sorry . But I figured as long as you 're there and undercover , you might want to know where Carpathia is . " " I do n't care where he is . I 'm here to find Buck . " " All right then . " " But just for smiles , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullhorn outside Herod 's Gate . Moved there from his bunker near the Sea of Galilee . Unless they were just broadcasting his voice . " " No , it was him all right . He 's moved his entire command post inside the Old City . " " Impossible . I 'm lookin ' down on it right now , and the place is crawling with- " " I thought so too until I heard where . Underground . " " You do n't mean- " " Solomon 's Stables . " " How do I get in there ? " " Follow somebody . Carpathia 's got an entire regiment there , and I got your new name on the list . " " That might not have been prudent , Chang . " " Why ? " " What if I choose not to go , am discovered missing , and someone sees me elsewhere ? " " Well , there is that possibility , yes . Tell ' em you 're on your way . " " What if I 'm not ? I mean , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chang , but my priority is Buck . And nothin ' we know about Carpathia now is going to amount to a hill of beans anyway . What 's gon na happen is gon na happen . Can you get me off that list ? " " Not without looking suspicious . Sorry , Mr. McCullum . I thought I was doing the right- " " Do n't worry about it . None of it will matter tomorrow , will it ? " Mac saw GC activity and other choppers putting down at the Tombs of the Prophets , south of the Mount of Olives , east of the Old City . Caravans of jeeps quickly loaded the disgorged personnel and raced them toward the conflict . As soon as Mac stepped out of his copter at 2:45 P.M. , an officer directing traffic pointed him to an armored personnel carrier . Mac saluted and jogged that way . He joined a dozen other like-uniformed soldiers , who merely nodded at each other , tight-lipped , and rode in stony silence . The cavalcade headed north on Jericho Road and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We headed to Herod 's Gate ? " someone said . " Is it open ? " someone else said . " Damascus Gate , " the driver announced . As they passed Herod 's Gate Mac joined the others in pressing against the windows on the south side of the vehicle . Somehow the resistance continued to hold the gate . " If you 're assigned to the potentate , " the driver said , " follow me to the entrance to the stables . Everybody else head for the staging area at the Church of the Flagellation . When we have enough personnel , we 'll attack the insurgents from behind and blow ' em out Herod 's Gate . " Mac felt himself swelling with pride over what Tsion and Buck had apparently accomplished before the rabbi was killed . If they had been at Herod 's Gate , they were responsible for helping hold that position against overwhelming odds . And neither of them battle trained . Mac assumed Buck would agree that Tsion would not want his body removed from the Old City . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rabbi . Bodies fallen in an active battle had a way of getting trampled beyond recognition . That would n't matter tomorrow either , but Mac knew he and Buck would be on the same page . Mac found himself fighting anguish . No way Buck would let them worry and wonder for this long . Surely he could have found a way to check in if he was alive . When the vehicle stopped and the driver gave the order , Mac and the soldiers got out and moved as directed . Mac dropped several paces behind his group and phoned Chang , speaking quietly . " Anything ? " " Nothing . " " I 'm not going to succeed , am I ? " " What do you want to hear , sir ? " " You know . " " I 'm past pretending , Mr. McCullum . " " I appreciate that . Maybe I should just proceed to my assignment . " " To the compound ? " " Yeah . I know I should have my head examined , but I 'd love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Chang felt Naomi 's strong fingers on either side of his neck . " You 're tense , " she said . " Are n't you ? " he said . " Relax , love . Messiah is coming . " Chang could n't turn from the screens . " I 'd like to lose no one else before that . No matter how much I tell myself they 'll be dead only a short while , it all seems so pointless now . I do n't want anyone hurt , let alone suffering , then dying . Mr. McCullum 's going was my idea . " " But he sure jumped on it , did n't he ? " " I knew he would . I wish I could have gone . " " You know this place ca n't function without your- " " Do n't start , Naomi . " " You know it 's true . " " Regardless . I sent him for my own vicarious thrill . No way he 's going to find Buck , and if he does , Buck will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If he gets found out , he 's history . And for what ? He could be here watching for the return with everyone else . " Naomi pulled a chair next to Chang and sat . " What do you hear from Mr. Smith ? " Chang sighed . " That 's turned out to be a waste of time and manpower too . So far he has n't found a thing . Either Captain Steele was obliterated by a missile or he was buried in the sand . " " Could he have crawled to safety ? " " There 's no safety in that sun , Naomi . " " That 's what I mean . Maybe he found shelter or built himself some shield against the heat . " Chang shrugged . " Best-case scenario , I guess . But would n't he think to leave some sign for us ? " " Maybe he was hurt too badly or simply had no resources . " " He could arrange sticks or rocks , even a piece of clothing . " " If he was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both jump . " Yes , Mr. Smith ? " " I 'm on his trail . He was on the move for a while , at least . " " What did you find ? " " Blood , I 'm afraid . "
