Chapter One The Intervention It was one of those utterances that sparkled - the very daring ! Could you see us ? Canoe shrugged , to be expected . After all , Canoe was our local recovering ; it was she who left those pamphlets in the clubhouse next to the men 's Nineteenth Hole . Still , the very daring ! Intervention . Canoe cracked her knuckles , lit a cigarette . We sat by her swimming pool absentmindedly pulling weeds from around the flagstones . The ice of our iced tea had already melted into water and it was too cold to swim , besides . " It 's obvious , " Canoe said , blowing . " He 's going to kill himself in less than a month . I do n't want that blood on my hands . " Who would ? He was someone we loved . Someone we could not help but love . A colleague of our ex-husbands , a past encounter . We had known Him since before we were we , from our first weeks in this town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The color of that movie actor 's hair , the famous one . Sometimes we caught just the gleam of it through the windshield of his BMW as He drove by . Sporty . Waving . Green metallic , leather interior . Some sort of monogram on the wheel . You 've seen the license plate ? SOLD . A realtor , but never desperate . Yes , He sold our Mimi Klondike 's Tudor on Twelve Oaks Lane with full knowledge of her rotting foundation . But desperate ? No . Just thirsty . " Intervention , " Barbara repeated . Canoe flexed her toes as if she had invented the word . This a late summer day , a fallish day . Ricardo , the pool boy , swept maple leaves from the pool water , in this light a dull , sickly yellow . We watched him ; we could n't take our eyes off . Canoe interrupted . " Actually , I should n't be the one explaining . There 's someone from the group who 's our expert . Pips Phelp , actually . " Pips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in whispers . Who knew who lived in trees ? Besides , He might drive up any minute . He often did . You 'd hear the crunch of His tires on the gravel , see the flash of blond hair behind the windshield . These times you 'd dry your hands on your shirtfront , check your face in the toaster . You would n't want to be caught , what ? Alone ? You let Him in . He 'd ask you to . He would stand at your door , behind your screen , wondering if He could . Of course , you 'd say , though you looked a mess . If you were unlucky , the dishwasher ran . One of the louder cycles . If you were lucky , all was still - the house in magical order , spotless , clean . He surveyed ; this was his job . You never knew , He told you , when He might be needed . You shivered . Him a handsome man . A man with the habit of standing close , His smell : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight teeth were white , though He did n't smile that way . His was a better smile , toothless , brief , as if He understood He had caught you with more than a wet shirtfront . You obliged the suspicion . You were always guilty of something . Still , you showed Him what you had done , were attempting . Recent renovations . Whatnot . A fabric swatch laid on the back of your couch . A roll of discount wallpaper for the powder room , shells of some sort . You 'd been trying , you 'd explain , to fix the place up . But things had gotten behind ; the contractor 's attentions divided , et cetera , et cetera . He nodded , or did not . His was a serious business : assessing value . Worth . Ricardo , the pool boy , served sandwiches . We had spent a few days per Canoe 's instruction , contemplating the responsibility of our action : the absolute commitment , the difficulty , the discipline , the sacrifice . Esther Curran now sat among us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how He had shown her a Cape near Grendale Knoll after Walter 's death , when she had believed she could n't bear it - the house , the reminders - and how she , Esther , was no longer a beautiful woman . Here Esther peeled the crust off her sandwich and looked away . We sat around her in Canoe 's wrought-iron ; it was too cold to lounge . The weather had suddenly turned , and the reason we sat around the pool at all was beyond us , unless it had something to do with Ricardo . We watched him receding toward the pool house then turned back to Esther . This was the point , Esther was saying , though we may have lost it . He had taken her hand . He had stroked it . He had told her of the possibilities . There was n't much to be done - the demolition of the Florida room , a few shingles rehung , refurbishing the kitchen . Think of it , He had told her . We watched Esther with looks on our faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she drove a Dodge and compared prices at the Safeway . Her husband , Walter , had died years ago , but she still referred to him as if he had run downtown for milk and would be back any minute . She allowed her hair to gray , her nails to go ragged . True , she had always been our eccentric - an artist , she kept chameleons in her living room draperies and would often arrive at parties with paint on her hands - but more than once in recent years , we understood , she had been escorted in the early hours of the morning , found wandering in robe and slippers on the old Route 32 , luckily rarely traveled , for she could have been struck down as easily as a stray dog . Now here she was among us . " Intervention , " she said , " is not a word of which I am particularly fond . " Esther cut her crustless sandwich into nine even squares . " Walter and I are of the live-and-let-live philosophy , " she continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one we confront here today , I say , yes . I say , intervene . " She picked up a square and we waited , thinking Esther might have more to add , but she simply smiled and popped it whole into her mouth . " Frankly , " Canoe said , this to Pips Phelp , who had convened the meeting and sat at the edge of us in a deck chair , " I do n't want to hear about Him wrapped around a telephone pole . I would n't be able to live with myself . " Pips Phelp nodded . We knew him from the Club , one of a number of men who zipped by in a cart heading elsewhere , gloved hand guiding the wheel . He seemed to have little to say , too quiet for an interventionist , though Canoe insisted he was skilled in these matters . And we had read in the literature that we needed him : a leader , a discussion initiator . " Understood , " he said . We agreed to meet the next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phelp would play His part . Did we understand fully , Pips had explained , that this would be tantamount to ambush ? There would be little time , he said . He will fight you . He will want to flee . He will deny your accusations . You will have to talk quickly . Under absolutely no circumstance can you allow Him to leave the vehicle . ( We had decided that this would be the place we 'd find Him . ) When it is over , one of you will get behind the wheel and drive Him to the Center . You will check Him in . It has been arranged . Pips Phelp now sat in his Buick , the motor running . We saw him clearly though we pretended not to : This was part of the plan . We pulled in in Viv 's Suburban and got out one at a time , no one saying a word . Canoe gave a short whistle and we circled the Buick , feeling the rush of the boarding-school escapade . What were we doing ? Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a poor substitute for Him , truth be told . He sat there in a gut-hold against the wheel , his fingers strumming . He smelled of gum , or mints , of pretzels , of efforts to stave off tobacco . We knew him as a weak man . We knew him as a man who could be trusted . His wife , Eleanor , carried the look of the perpetually bored ; his children were overachievers . You can only guess at the good-cheer stickers on the bumper of his Buick . He was a hedge trimmer , a leaf raker , a model-boat builder ; he was a man who never thought of selling . Every spring along the borders of the driveway to his house - a ranch just past the K &O; Cemetery - he planted red and pink impatiens . " Pips ! " This from Canoe , acting surprised , our signal to converge . Pips looked up , turned off the engine . " Canoe ! " he said , our signal to open his doors . Canoe had already slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignition . Our hearts beat too loud , drumlike . We were not used to intervening . " What is this ? " Pips said . " What 's everybody doing here ? " His talent was not for acting . He sounded like a commercial you might see on late-night television . " We 're here because we love you , " Canoe said . " We 're here because we care about your life . " We flushed . Who would n't ? We did n't care for Pips 's life . We wanted Him . We wanted His smooth leather shoes , His argyle socks , His blue cashmere double-breasted coat . We wanted His promise of future appreciation . " What are you talking about ? " Pips said , shifting around to look at those of us in the backseat . Some could n't fit and leaned on the windows . " What 's the big idea ? " We laughed ; we could n't help it . " Please , Pips , " Viv said to clue him in . " He 'd never say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look and turned back toward the windshield . He composed himself , a man of infinite patience , then shifted around again . " What 's the meaning of this ? " he said . " The meaning , " said Viv , " is concern . You are a sick person . It 's not your fault . You ca n't help yourself . It 's genetic . You need help . We 're here to help you . " Some of us bit our fingernails . Pips laughed like Bela Lugosi . " Sick ? Me ? What do you mean by these unfounded accusations . I 've never felt better . I think you 're sick . I think you are all suffering from a serious mental health problem . " This was going all wrong . No one sounded like a real person . " What we 're trying to say , " said Judy Sawyer , but she did n't know what . Then came a long and awkward pause . Canoe sighed , audibly . " Come on , ladies , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then she opened the passenger side and got out , signaling for us to do the same . We did , as Pips Phelp waited , pretending , once again , that he had just driven up . Know that we are a close-knit community . We 've lived here for years , which is not to say that our ancestors are buried here ; simply , this is the place we have all ended up . We were married in 1953 . Divorced in 1976 . Our grown daughters pity us ; our grown sons forget us . We have grandchildren we visit from time to time , but their manners agitate , so we return , nervous , thankful to view them at a distance . Most of us excel at racquet sports . It is not in our makeup to intervene . This goes against the grain , is entirely out of our character . We allow for differences , but strive not to show them . Ours are calm waters , smooth sailing . Yes , some among us visit therapists , but , quite frankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our former passion for fondue , or our semester learning decoupage . We 've seen a lot . We 've seen the murder-suicide of the Clifford Jacksons , Tate Kieley jailed for embezzlement , Dorothy Schoenbacher in nothing but a mink coat in August dive from the roof of the Cooke 's Inn . We 've seen Dick Morehead arrested in the ladies ' dressing room at Lord &; Taylor , attempting to squeeze into a petite teddy . We 've seen Francis Stoney gone mad , Brenda Nelson take to cocaine . We 've seen the blackballing of the Stewart Collisters . We 've seen more than our share of liars and cheats , thieves . Drunks ? We could n't count . Still , He 's someone we love . And , in truth , we love few . Early the morning after our practice run , we met again at the Safeway . Canoe brought a thermos of coffee and we stood drinking from our styrofoam cups in the early cold as if at a tailgate . It did seem a game , the weather , football weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere . A strong wind set loose shopping carts in random directions , as if they were being pushed by the ghosts of shoppers past . Coupon offers and flyers of various sorts blew about as well . Canoe suggested coffee cake , but we declined . We were , on the whole , nervous . We enjoyed our weekly stocking up at the Safeway ; we kept lists . But to linger in its parking lot felt just shy of delinquency and a long way from Canoe 's swimming pool and Ricardo 's languid strokes . When we finally spotted Pips Phelp 's Buick turning in , our spirits had undeniably flagged . Pips did n't seem to notice . " Ladies , " he said , slamming the door , getting out . " Top of the morning ! " Was this man always working from some sort of script ? " Why the long faces ? " he said . " They 'll get over it , " Canoe said . She dropped her styrofoam cup to the asphalt and crushed it , twisting her flat as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riveted . You do not need to tell us we were stalling . Canoe got into her Jeep and rolled down the window . " Understand , " she told him , " they 're not used to unpleasantness . " We have seen a lot , it 's true , but know so little . How were we to learn ? Years ago we were led down the primrose lane , then abandoned somewhere near the carp pond . Suffice it to say there is little nourishment here and the carp have grown strange cancers . When we look in their pond we see them beneath our own watery faces . But think of the consequence : His disappearance . We piled in as instructed . We buckled our safety belts . We turned to Pips Phelp , who stood in salute , and waved . Canoe gunned the Jeep . " Hi-ho , Silver , " she said , and we were off , the plan to find Him come hell or high water , to drive to the limits of our town , to cover His turf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his flaccid pink face in the rearview . We were n't nice . We made fun . We said how ordinary was Pips , how completely known . We said how He could flatten Pips Phelp with one fist . " Kaboom ! " Barbara shouted . And she meant it . " Kaboom ! Kaboom ! " She raised her fist and punched the air . " Why the anger ? " Mimi Klondike asked , as if intervention were catching . Barbara shrugged . " Felt like it ? " she said . Esther , we noticed , did n't speak . She was n't often of late among us , and now she might as well not have been . She sat in the back of the Jeep staring out the window , some kind of smock we would n't be caught dead in spread over her legs . She had letters in her pockets to people we had never met ; her hair seemed unwashed . " Esther ? " Mimi Klondike said . " Why the long face ? " Barbara smirked , but Esther simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or this might have been her natural expression . Beyond her , our country - changing maples , stone walls , gravel drives , newly washed automobiles , children , horses , dogs - passed . But we were looking at Esther . " I was thinking how strange , " she finally said . " I was thinking how strange to be alive . " Then she turned away . We drove in silence ; what else was there to do ? Time passed and we thought our thoughts ; we thought of Him . How He held a flashlight to our souls , our basements . How He checked for dry rot , carpenter ants , the carcasses of flying insects .
