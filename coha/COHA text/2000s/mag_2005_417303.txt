Q My sister wants to buy my daughter a pricey doll , but I think it will make her less appreciative of gifts we buy . Should I say something to my sister ? A Why go and upset her just for being generous ? Aunts get a lot of pleasure out of spoiling their nieces and nephews , and this is one of the ways they do it . Look at it this way : Parents supply the necessities , and when they can , relatives supply the frills . If you feel this present is inappropriate for reasons other than the price tag-it 's too delicate for a toddler , for instance-then simply thank your sister for the gift , and whisk that delicate doll out of your child 's slobbery little hands the minute she 's gone ( your daughter will probably be so busy playing with the box it came in , she wo n't notice it 's missing ! ) . Display it on a shelf in your child 's room so Auntie will see that her gift is appreciated , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her doll , let her play with it . Or you could just go ahead and let her run amok with love over it , and your sister can have the fun of giving her niece her first fancy doll . This gift , and even years of other gifts like it , wo n't taint your child 's values . She 'll soak up the principles she sees you live by . If you establish family traditions that emphasize nonmaterialism , like making cards and little gifts for one another , and if you ooh and aah over a macaroni-glued picture frame as much as you do a pricey silk scarf , then your daughter will learn that when it comes to gift giving and receiving , it 's the thought , not the price tag , that counts . I 'm pregnant , she 's not Q I 'm stalling on announcing my pregnancy to my best friend , who 's having a hard time getting pregnant . How do I tell her ? A When I was expecting my first child , a friend of mine was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my news . It seemed cruel , as if I 'd be saying , " I 'm expecting , and you 're not . " But I was just as worried about not telling her . Holding back such big news from a friend makes both of you feel awkward when you do talk about it , and eventually you will . So tell your friend soon , and tell her plainly , but do n't gush . You might say , " I 'm pregnant , and I was eager to tell you because you 're my best friend . " Answer any questions she has , but then ask her how she 's doing . This will allow her to change the subject if she needs to or continue it if she 's up to talking about her own struggles and plans , and yours . There 's a fine line between being sensitive and being patronizing , and people in pain appreciate sensitivity that respects their dignity and assumes their strength . But do n't be surprised or hurt if your friend is less than happy about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out . It 's not your fault that you 're pregnant , and it 's not her fault that she wants to be . And you still have a friendship that has nothing to do with babies . You could break the news over the phone , to give yourself and her a little psychic space . But if you can summon the courage , have this talk in person . There 's nothing like being able to hug , and be hugged , at the end of an emotional discussion . Big for his age Q My 3-year-old looks like he 's 6 , so people expect him to act more mature . How can I make them see that his behavior is age-appropriate ? A So often it 's the misguided grown-ups around a child who need constant reminding that just because a person wears a size 6 , that does n't mean he 's 6 . Madeline , our eldest , has always been big for her age . I remember times when I could n't decide who I was more annoyed with , my screaming toddler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that condescending tone of feigned surprise and mockery they normally reserved for much older kids who misbehave . " You 're too big to act like a baby ! " they 'd say . " Well , no , she is a baby , " I wanted to yell . And then as soon as I was finished mentally defending her , I 'd imagine myself wringing my little monster 's neck for causing a scene in the first place . Eventually , I came up with a few strategies to deal . I would say aloud to whoever was listening , " Oh boy , this is some classic three-year-old behavior , " to remind us all that my " big girl " was still quite little inside . I also made a point of choosing clothes for her that looked like items kids age 3 or 4 should be wearing ( unlike those belly-button tops all the first-graders were sporting ) . Dressing your age has at least a subliminal effect on how people think of you . I also posted on our refrigerator a baby photo of Madeline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that picture still reminds me that growing up takes a long time , and that no matter how big she gets , she 'll always be my baby .
