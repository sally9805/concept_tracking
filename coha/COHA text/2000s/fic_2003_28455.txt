Chapter One " Hell , I ca n't fire Waldo ! He 's been ramrod on the Rolling M since before I was born . " Snorting angrily , Caid Matthews down-shifted the pickup to climb another steep grade . " He 's eighty , dammit , and I 'm not firing him . Dad gave him a good retirement package . And it 's not like he 'll have to live on the streets . He can move to Florida , like he always said he would . Flirt with the blue-haired widows . Maybe marry one . " " Sure that 's what he says , but everybody knows that 's just talk . Waldo 's lived in West Texas all his life , most of it in the Davis Mountains as a hand on the Rolling M. The day he shucks his Levi 's for swimming trunks is the day the sun stands still . " Caid sighed and used a knuckle to rub the bridge of his nose . He 'd been fighting with himself over this for the past week , his brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but his heart knowing it would kill the old man to leave the Rolling M. And it was n't just Waldo . The Rolling M 's finances were in deep horse hockey in a way they 'd never been before . Caid had trimmed everywhere he could find to trim , with part of him knowing it had to be done and the other part madder than hell that he had to do it . Waldo had to go . There was no other way . And five hundred acres had to go , too . That five hundred acres might be only a drop in the Rolling M 's proverbial bucket , but never in the history of the ranch had any acreage been sold . Though he knew there was no alternative , Caid often felt like his soul was being ripped in two . The pickup topped the grade and settled into the long glide toward a wide valley below where he 'd have several miles of flat . Good . Now he could make up time . Hell of a thing . He 'd driven from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked into the hotel so he could be at the bank first thing in the morning . But he 'd no sooner placed his duffel bag beside the bed than he realized he 'd left the papers he needed for the bank on the kitchen table . There was nothing else to do but return to the ranch and get them , then make the long drive back to town . Just went to show the state of mind he was in lately . He 'd never been this forgetful . Why , he 'd even left his hat with his lucky jay feather back in the hotel room . Now on the flats , Caid sent the ancient truck flying down the highway . The sun was low in the west and he had n't passed another vehicle in the last twenty miles - not unusual in this part of Texas . " You ever stop to think that leaving those papers might be a way of telling you something ? " Caid shook his head angrily , wishing he could somehow yank his other , softer side completely out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfered with every decision he knew he had to make . " I 've got to sell and that 's all there is to it . It 's that or lose the whole damn ranch . I 'm doing what I have t - " A deer ! Stepping right into the headlights . With no shoulder to the road , he swerved off the highway completely to avoid the petrified animal . By the grace of God and three good inches , he missed it . Unfortunately , he did n't miss the sixty-year-old ponderosa pine . " Your man is a western man , honey . " " Oh , Gram . Please . I 'm going to West Texas for a vacation , not another man . After Nicholas , I ca n't think of anything I want less . " " The Great Ones do n't care if you want him or not , Marlie . They just told me he 's in Fort Davis . Take him or leave him , it 's yours to decide . " " I 'll leave him , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playmate while I 'm there . Just warn them that I 'm not bringing home any souvenirs . " " Do n't be flip , dear . It 's not becoming . Besides , the heart has a mind of its own . " " Sounds like a country-western song , Gram . And I do n't have a heart anymore . Nicholas threw it out with yesterday 's leftovers . " Recalling the conversation she 'd had with her grandmother before leaving San Antonio , Marlie smiled grimly to herself and signaled to exit the interstate . Forty more miles and she 'd be in the picturesque little town of Fort Davis where she planned to get a grip . Forty extremely dark miles . The state highway had even less traffic than I-10 , and led her through the kind of darkness San Antonio had n't experienced for over a century . A million stars spangled the sky . Gradually , however , the stars along the horizon blotted into a jagged line that Marlie assumed were the Davis Mountains . The road twisted and turned as it wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Marlie 's neck and shoulders ached with tension and exhaustion . Sighing , she thought of the brightly lit motel she 'd passed eighty miles behind her . She 'd almost stopped . Why had n't she ? After all , she did n't have hotel reservations to keep . Her friend , Jill , who had recommended Fort Davis as a great place to relax and hike - a good place to recover , she 'd meant - had said reservations were n't necessary this time of year . Yet Marlie had passed up the motel and was now figuratively kicking herself for it . This was supposed to be a vacation , not an endurance race . It did n't matter if she spent the night in Fort Davis , for Heaven 's sake ! Yet here she was , seven hours out of San Antonio and eighty miles past common sense . Her part Native American grammie would say The Great Ones guided her . But then , Gram did n't like to admit that any of her family were stupid . Stupid over men , stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . To Gram , descended from a noted shaman , everything was a sign . Take the blue feather that now rested in Marlie 's shirt pocket , for instance . After uncharacteristically stalling her with errands and lunch and cleaning the kitchen , Gram had finally allowed Marlie to head out the door to get her vacation underway . She 'd placed a loving arm around Marlie 's shoulders and walked her to the car . " You 'll see , " the older woman said . " Your happiness is in the west , sweetness . Look . Here 's your sign . " Following Gram 's pointing finger , Marlie obligingly looked down . A small blue feather lay on the concrete drive right beside the car door . " Take it with you , dear . Your man has the other one . " But Marlie had hesitated before picking it up . ( Continues ... )
