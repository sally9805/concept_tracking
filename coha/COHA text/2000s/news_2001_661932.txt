EDITOR 'S NOTE - This is the final part of a five-day serial portraying courage in wildfire 's way . By DAVID FOSTER Associated Press Writer <p> CONCOW , Calif . ( AP ) - Beneath swirling smoke , Capt . Darryl Sanford sees light at the end of the hallway - faint and orange , from the fire outside . <p> It means a window . It means escape . <p> He pushes the woman toward it . Beverly Brooks is fading fast , her emphysema aggravated by the smoke and sheer terror of being trapped in a burning house . Sanford is getting lightheaded himself . <p> He herds her into a bedroom and slams the door behind them to buy time . Yes , there 's a window . The sill is high , about four feet up . It has a 4-foot-wide picture window in the center , bracketed by two sliding sections , each about 2 feet across . <p> It will be a heave to get Brooks out . Sixty-seven years old and just 4-feet-11 , she 's a heavyset 145 pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the sliding windows , if first he can get her across the huge bed in the way . <p> He 'll have to try . Every other exit has been sealed by the wildfire rioting outside . Ten minutes ago , Sanford told Brooks he 'd try to save her house . Now , with fire in the kitchen , attic and living room , they 're desperate to save themselves . <p> Brooks is no longer talking . She leans against the bed , gasping . <p> " We 've got to go out that window , " Sanford yells . <p> No sooner does he say it than flames fill the window . <p> Their escape route is gone . <p> " Jesus help me ! " Sanford cries . <p> He steps across the mattress to the window , slides open the left side and peers out . Wind-driven flames are eddying off the roof , circling down toward the ground and shooting back up along the outside wall . <p> Maybe they can make it after all , Sanford thinks . They 'll surely get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beats staying put . <p> He clambers back over the bed and seizes Brooks ' shoulders . But she has gone limp , collapsing against the edge of the bed . He ca n't get her out without her help . Even if he can drag her across the bed and push her out the window , she 'll land in burning grass , unable to save herself . <p> There are no more options . <p> Sanford stands paralyzed . A firefighter does not leave someone behind . Yet if he does n't leave her , two people will die here , not one . <p> " C'm on . We got ta go . We got ta go . " He grabs her shoulders again . She does n't move . <p> He can not abandon her . He must not . <p> Suddenly the room brightens . The heat soars , and pain sears Sanford 's face . This is flashover , when a room 's materials , heated to the ignition point , spontaneously burst into flame . They are about to be cooked . <p> Sanford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bounding step across the bed , he launches himself headfirst toward the window , diving through the screen like a swimmer into surf . <p> He lands on hands and knees in the flaming grass . Immediately , his fingers start burning through his leather gloves . His back and arm are blistering beneath his fire-retardant shirt . He bounces to his feet and runs . Under torching trees , across the burning lawn , he runs . <p> Back at the engine in the driveway , firefighter Will Krings is frantically trying to reconnect a hose . Just a few more seconds , he thinks , and he 'll be able to break a front window and lay down some water to help Sanford and the woman escape - if he can find them . <p> Now a silhouette wavers against the orange at the corner of the house . Sanford is streaking toward him , like an ember spit from the fire . His eyes are wild , his cheeks crimson . He fumbles off his gloves , and Krings can see the fingers are already blistering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to leave her . " <p> Sanford stares blankly . Krings stares back , unable to think of what to say . <p> Sanford breaks the silence . <p> " I 'm burned . I need water . " <p> Krings pours bottled water into Sanford 's cupped hands , then drives them both part way down the hill , where they wait out the fire in a black spot already burned over . <p> Rushed by fire truck , ambulance and helicopter to a hospital 20 miles away in Chico , Sanford is treated for second-degree burns on his back , face , fingers and elbow . Burned red into his back are the letters " C " and " F , " branded there by the " CDF Fire " logo on his T-shirt as he sprinted through the flames . <p> By 7 a.m. , less than four hours after his narrow escape , he 's back at the fire station , lying on his bunk . All he wants to do is sleep , but he ca n't . The fire scorched his corneas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The wildfire , done with Beverly Brooks ' house , races southwest along Nelson Bar Road and toward Oroville Lake . <p> Norm and Lesta Williams flee in their pickup truck and motor home , driving past flaming houses and trees . Their own home survives , surrounded by fire engines . Just 200 feet away , the house that Norm 's parents built in 1910 burns to the ground . <p> By midmorning , the wind has faded and the fire is losing power , burning through grass and brush more sparse than the timber and thicket that stoked its early-morning rage . By Wednesday afternoon , just 24 hours after it started , the fire slows enough to let firefighters rein it in again - this time for good . <p> The triple-digit heat sinks into the 90s on Thursday , then into the 70s on Friday , Sept. 22 . Autumn has arrived , and firefighters turn to mop-up , dousing spot fires and mending bulldozer-flattened fences . <p> Officials tally the numbers of the Concow Incident : 1,845 acres burned , 1,558 personnel assigned , 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life lost . Beverly Brooks is buried in Yankee Hill Cemetery , a mile from home . Her son Barry , hoping to erase the awful memories , pays a wrecking crew to cart away every last bit of rubble . <p> The county files charges against Jim Stewart , the backyard bulldozer operator , claiming that the dozer 's blade or tread struck a rock to spark the fire . Stewart , facing possible liability for $4 million in property losses and firefighting costs , insists he did n't do it . <p> By and large , Stewart 's burned-out neighbors do n't blame him . Many direct their anger at the firefighters instead . <p> Rumors fly that firefighters ' own back fires caused much of the damage , an assertion vehemently denied by fire officials . Some residents complain that more was n't done to protect houses . The firefighters shrug and point to homes they did save , including pine-draped bungalows that by all rights should have burned . <p> The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection investigates Brooks ' death and the fire-shelter deployment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest that Engineer Tony Brownell should have notified supervisors before setting the back fire that blew up and pinned him and his crew beneath fire shelters . <p> Brownell draws a different lesson . Chastened by his close call , the man known for his aggressive firefighting says he 'll be less likely to defend a marginal home next time . <p> " I think I 'd just leave , " Brownell tells investigators . " I do n't know , maybe we were too much at risk . " <p> As for Capt . Darryl Sanford , the agency 's top fire official says it appears Sanford went beyond the call of duty to stay as long as he did while fire engulfed Brooks ' house . <p> " We do n't expect our firefighters to give their lives for this kind of thing , and I do n't think anybody else does , " says Glen Newman , CDF 's deputy director for fire protection . " We have to teach people to give us a defensible space . They ca n't expect us to do the impossible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Real Hero , " Sanford says he does n't feel like one . <p> His burns are healed now , but that fiery night on Stagecoach Lane haunts him . Trusting that God makes things happen for a reason , he tries not to beat himself up over it . He knows there will be a next time . There always is . <p> On Nelson Bar Road , new homes are going up where the old ones burned down . Along Stagecoach Lane , the pasture is green again . Flowers soon will fill the field , and by July the weeds will be 3 feet tall . <p> They will be brittle , brown and ready to burn . <p> EDITOR 'S NOTE - David Foster is AP 's Northwest Regional Writer , based in Seattle . <p> End Adv for Thursday , March 1 <p>
