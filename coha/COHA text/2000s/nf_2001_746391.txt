The labeling of different activities as feminine and masculine is largely a social construction based on stereotyped expectations regarding gender and perceived gender differences . Sports have generally been labeled as masculine , although some sports are considered to be feminine . Suggestions based on theoretical considerations have been made about the features that may underlie the categorization of sports as feminine or masculine . The goal of this study was to examine what men and women perceive to be characteristic of different sports and of the participants of these sports . The purpose was also to examine whether these perceptions could be related to beliefs about gender appropriateness regarding sport participation . The results revealed that sports categorized as gender-neutral , feminine , and masculine , were perceived as different on several features , such as aesthetics and femininity , danger and risk , speed , and masculinity . These perceptions are in accordance with stereotyped expectations of femininity and masculinity and could explain the perceptions of some sports as feminine or masculine . <p> Certain tasks and activities have traditionally been assigned to men and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be masculine or feminine activities . These categorizations are to a large extent social constructions based on our expectations regarding gender , and on our beliefs that gender categories are natural , unambiguous , bipolar , static , and individual . They are also grounded in our perceptions of differences between these gender categories . These assumptions about gender and gender categories are in turn based on socially constructed , historically specific , and cultural representations of the social interactions that occur among gendered individuals through their relations to each other . These concepts and constructs are thereby sometimes subject to change ( e.g. , Acker , 1990 , 1999 ; Lorber , 1994 ) . <p> Sport has traditionally been regarded as primarily a male territory ( e.g. , Birrell , 1983 ; Birrell &; Theberge , 1994 ; Lenskyj , 1990 ; Matteo , 1986 ; Messner , 1988 , 1990a , 1990b ; Pedersen &; Kono , 1990 ; Snyder &; Spreitzer , 1983 ) . it has been suggested that sport is a representation of the sociocultural system in which it occurs and that sports reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rituals , and values of the societies in which they are developed , it is therefore argued that sport has been , and continues to be , a site for the construction , reconstruction , strengthening , and naturalization of perceived gender differences , and , further , that it serves to reaffirm the gender dichotomization and the gender order in which the gender categories are differently valued ( Birrell &; Cole , 1990 ; Guttman , 1978 , 1986 ; Hargreaves , 1986 ; Kane &; Snyder , 1989 ; Messner , 1988 ) . <p> Sports become stereotyped as gender-neutral , feminine , or masculine based on conceptions regarding gender , gender differences , and beliefs about the appropriateness of participation due to gender ( Colley , Nash , O'Donnell , &; Restorick , 1987 ; Csizma , Wittig &; Schurr , 1988 ; Koivula , 1995 ; Matteo , 1986 ; Metheny , 1965 ; Ostrow , Jones , &; Spiker , 1981 ; Salminen , 1990 ) . Metheny ( 1965 ) and Postow ( 1980 ) have tried to determine the features that underlie the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sports labeled as feminine seem to be those sports that are considered as appropriate for women to participate in , that is , sports that allow women participants to remain true to the stereotyped expectations of femininity ( such as being graceful and nonaggressive ) and that provide for beauty and aesthetic pleasure . The component of beauty as an element of the sport seems to be an important aspect of the perceived femininity of a sport . This is probably because it is an important aspect in the general concept of femininity . The female body continues to be identified as an object by masculinist culture . Females are also socialized to use their bodies to please others , value themselves based on their passive ornamental qualities through the masculine eyes of others , and to compare their appearance with that of the dominant feminine ideal . Sports that seek to provide beauty and visual pleasure are thereby not only acceptable for females but well in line with stereotyped expectations of femininity ( Duncan , 1994 ; Metheny , 1965 ; Young , 1995 ) . <p> At least four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve as reasons for a sport to be characterized as masculine . One set of features that is conductive to the perception of a sport as masculine is characterizable by the required behavior of the sport participant according to the rules of the game . This cluster of features , as argued by Metheny ( 1965 ) , include 1 ) attempts to physically overpower the opponent/s by body contact , 2 ) direct use of bodily force to heavy object , 3 ) projection of body into or through space over distances , and 4 ) face-to-face competition in situations in which body contact may happen . These characteristics are perhaps believed to be especially appropriate expressions of masculine attributes such as aggressiveness , effectiveness , and power . But , as Postow ( 1980 ) has argued , although a sport that possesses these features very likely would be labeled as masculine because of the connotation of the features to traditional masculine attributes , there are probably other grounds as well that might lead to the categorization of a sport as masculine . <p> A second cluster of features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing well and excelling in the sport , and with which the sport is played , such as aggressiveness , competitive spirit , discipline , and stamina , and devotion to a team ( Postow , 1980 ) . Of course , many or perhaps all sports could be seen as masculine according this list of qualities . However , a sport in which aggressiveness is not only approved but even regarded as an essential part of the sport and considered as part of an athlete 's sporting skills ( such as ice hockey and football ) , is qualified as especially masculine ( Postow , 1980 ; Weinstein , Smith , &; Wiesenthal , 1995 ; Young &; Smith , 1988 ) . <p> A sport may also be considered to be masculine if it functions in society to reinforce a sense of identity and solidarity with men as separate from women . According to Postow ( 1980 ) , football is one example of a sport that traditionally has served this function in the U.S. society , largely because football has been designated as an activity appropriate for males @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to foster the socialization of males in line with " the particular ideal of masculine gender identity embodied in the masculine attitudinal mode " ( Postow , 1980 , p. 53 ) . Sports that include aggressiveness and competitiveness fit this model . Athleticism is often strongly linked to and interpreted as muscularity , physical strength , and power , and therefore often equated with masculinity ( Dyer , 1982 ) . Postow ( 1980 ) also points out that a sport tends to be regarded as masculine when the definition of athletic excellence for that sport includes capacities such as absolute strength and speed , capacities for which men have a statistical advantage over women . Because of the physiological differences between men and women , the " objective " statistical measures of absolute speed and strength work to " prove the natural " athletic abilities of males ( Messner , 1988 ) . Much of the world of sport is thereby labeled as masculine on the basis of biology . <p> However , the features that have been identified as the constituents of the categorizarelated to the perceived characteristics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectations and perceptions include the features identified by Metheny ( 1965 ) and Postow ( 1980 ) . Furthermore , because sport has a strong masculine connotation , it is possible that men and women have different perceptions of sports . Findings have revealed that men gender-type sports to a greater extent than do women ( Colley , Nash , . O'Donnell , &; Restorick , 1987 ; Koivula , 1995 ; Matteo , 1986 ) . This could indicate that men and women have somewhat different beliefs about the characteristics and requirements of sports and the participants of these sports . It could also indicate that these perceptions are of different significance for men and women when they categorize a sport as either feminine or masculine . Hence , the aim of this study was to examine men and women 's perceptions of characteristics of sports that are categorized as gender-neutral , feminine , and masculine . Methods <p> Participants <p> An initial sample of 30 psychology students participated in a preliminary study in order to provide for questionnaire items ( see Procedure and Variables ) . These students did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a total of 403 students participated . The 403 ( 179 men and 224 women ) participants were students at Stockholm University , the Royal Institute of Technology , Stockholm University College of Physical Education and Sports , and Boson Sport College . The mean age was 25.9 years ( SD = 5.7 ) for the entire sample . The mean age for men was 24.9 ( SD = 4.0 ) , and for women 26.7 ( SD = 6.6 ) . The psychology students participated as part of their course requirements . The other participating students participated without any compensation . <p> Procedure and Variables <p> The initial sample of 30 students were asked to list their characteristics and requirements of one sport with which they had had firsthand experience . They were also asked to list the characteristics of one sport with which they had not had any experience . The respondents provided a total of 117 descriptors . A questionnaire was subsequently constructed with these 117 different descriptors relating to characteristics and requirements of a sport and the participants of that sport . <p> In the subsequent main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short questionnaire regarding their gender , age and physical exercise habits . They then completed the questionnaire regarding perceived characteristics of a sport , in the questionnaire , the respondent was asked to rate to what degree the descriptor is characteristic of the sport or those practicing the sport using a seven-point scale from I ( " Not at all characteristic of the sport/sport participant " ) to 7 ( " Very much characteristic of the sport/sport participant " ) . For each participant , the sport to be rated was randomly selected out of 41 different sports , 19 of which have been rated gender-neutral , 7 of which have been rated feminine , and 15 of which have been rated masculine . The 41 sports were gender-labeled according the categorizations made in a previous study on gender-labeling of sports that was based on a Swedish sample ( see Koivula , 1995 ) . Results <p> After using a Scree-Test , the Criterion of Substantive Importance , and the requirement of at least three variables for each factor , a principal component analysis performed on the sport characteristics questionnaire with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participants , revealed 12 clearly distinct sets of items with a total of 97 items ( 20 of the items did not load sufficiently ( &lt;.30 ) on the 12 factors that emerged ) . <p> The twelve extracted factor-based scales ( see Table I ) were labeled ( I ) Aesthetics and Femininity , which consisted of items such as " graceful " and " feminine " ; ( 2 ) Danger/Risk and Violence , which included items such as " violent " and " risky " ; ( 3 ) Team Spirit , comprised of items such as " cooperation " and " teamwork " ; ( 4 ) Fair Play and Morals , which included items such as " honesty " ; ( 5 ) Speed , which consisted of items such as " fast " and " rapidity " ; ( 6 ) Advanced Skills and Precision , which contained items such as " skillful " and " accuracy " ; ( 7 ) Commercialism , which included items such as " money " and " advertising " ; ( 8 ) Strength and Endurance , comprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endurance " ; ( 9 ) Equipment , which contained items such as " equipment " ; ( 10 ) Masculinity , which included items such as " masculine " and " manly " and negatively loading " gender equity " ; ( 11 ) Excitement and Challenge , which consisted of items such as " exciting " ; and ( 12 ) Cognitive Efficiency , comprised of items such as " intelligence " and " use of strategies " . The internal consistency was calculated for each scale and ranged between proportional to = 0.63 ( scale 5 ) and proportional to = 0.93 ( scale i ) for the 12 extracted scales . <p> The ratings of characteristics were made on 41 different sports , shown in Table 2 . The sports were considered as either gender-neutral , feminine , or masculine , based on the categorizations made in a previous study on gender-labeling of sports ( Koivula , 1995 ) . These categorizations of sports were used in the statistical analyses of the present study . <p> Twelve univariate 2 by 3 ( Gender : female-male by Sportcategory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences between the female and male ratings of the gender-neutral , feminine , and masculine sportcategories for the 12 factor-based scales . To control for Type ! errors when performing multiple tests , the Bonferroni method was used to determine the significance level alpha : proportional to/c = 0.05/36 = 0.0014 . As will be seen below , the degrees of freedom pertaining to the number of persons varies somewhat in the analyses . This is due to the fact that between one ( 1 ) and eight ( 8 ) of the respondents omitted one or several items on one or more factors . Consequently , these were excluded from the particular analysis in question . <p> The two-way ANOVA with ratings on the first variable , Aesthetics and femininity , as the dependent variable , showed a significant effect of sportcategory ( F2,394=195.2 , p&lt;.0001 ) . Post hoc tests ( Scheffe ) detected significant differences among all three categories . The mean ratings were highest for sports labeled feminine and lowest for sports labeled masculine , as can be seen in Table 3 . <p> The corresponding two-way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , revealed a significant effect of sportcategory ( F2,391 = 109.6 , p&lt;.0001 ) . Post hoc tests ( Scheffe ) showed that masculine sports had significantly higher scores than gender-neutral and feminine sports . <p> The two-way ANOVA performed on the third scale , Team Spirit , disclosed a significant effect of sportcategory ( F2,391 = 11.56 , p&lt;.0001 ) . Post hoc tests ( Scheffe ) showed that masculine sports had significantly higher scores than gender-neutral and feminine sports . A corresponding two-way ANOVA with scores on the fourth scale , Fair Play and Morals as the dependent variable , revealed a significant effect of sportcategory ( F2,392= 15.01 , p&lt;.0001 ) . Post hoc tests ( Scheffe ) showed that gender-neutral sports had significantly higher scores than feminine and masculine sports . <p> The two-way ANOVA executed on the fifth scale , Speed , disclosed a significant effect of sportcategory ( F2,393= 11.34 , p&lt;.0001 ) . Post hoc tests ( Scheffe ) revealed that masculine sports had significantly higher scores than gender-neutral sports . <p> A significant effect of sportcategory was also revealed for the sixth scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Post hoc tests ( Scheffe ) detected differences among all three groups . The mean ratings were highest for the sports labeled feminine and were lowest for masculine sports , as can be seen in Table 3 . <p> The ANOVA performed on the seventh scale , Commercialism , revealed no significant effects of gender , sportcategory , or interaction between gender and sportcategory . But , for the eighth scale , Strength and Endurance , the effect of gender approached statistical significance ( F 1,393 = 8.50 , p=.0038 ) , which indicates that women tended to give higher ratings to these qualities than men did , as can be seen in Table 3 . <p> On the ninth scale , Equipment , the two-way ANOVA revealed a significant effect of sportcategory ( F2,393=6.97 , p&lt;.0012 ) . Post hoc tests ( Scheffe ) indicated that neutral sports had received significantly higher scores than did feminine sports . <p> A significant effect of sportcategory was also disclosed by the ANOVA for the tenth scale , Masculinity ( F2,396= 134.26 , p&lt;.0001 ) . Post hoc tests ( Scheffe ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this variable than both gender-neutral and feminine sports did . <p> The two-way ANOVA performed on the eleventh scale , Excitement and Challenge , disclosed that gender and sportcategory in interaction had a significant effect on ratings ( F2,394=7.48 , p&lt;.0007 ) . Men and women differed in their ratings on sports that were categorized as feminine . As can be seen in Table 3 , men rated feminine sports as less exciting and challenging than gender-neutral and masculine sports , whereas women rated feminine sports higher than gender-neutral and masculine sports on this scale . <p> On the twelfth scale , Cognitive Efficiency , the effect of sportcategory only approached significance ( F2,394=4.81 , p=.0086 ) . The effect of gender , as well as the interaction effect , were also not significant . As displayed in Table 3 , men tended to give lower ratings to feminine sports . Discussion <p> The principal component analysis performed on the sport characteristics questionnaire resulted in twelve factor-based scales , shown in Table 1 . it is interesting to observe that attributes such as " aesthetical , " " beauty , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same factor as " feminine " and " womanly , " whereas the characteristics " masculine " and " manly " loaded on a separate factor . Appearance and attractiveness in sport seem to be strongly related to what is perceived as femininity in sport . These notions are obviously seen as elements of the same concept . <p> This finding supports the proposition put forward by Metheny ( 1965 ) regarding perceived femininity of a sport . As can be seen in Table 2 , all sports labeled as feminine , except aerobics , scored high on scale one ( 1 ) Aesthetics and Femininity . But , for what reasons does a sport become rated as a feminine sport when it is not perceived as particularly characterizable by the one feature that has been suggested to be distinctive of feminine sports ? An examination of the sport of aerobics reveals something that is connected to the stereotyped expectations of femininity , namely the perceived purpose of the sport . Aerobics is a fitness sport that is often participated in for motives having to do with appearance ( Frederick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown that motives for participation in a sport that are related to appearance and weight management are stronger for females than for males ( Cash , Novy , &; Grant , 1994 ; Frederick &; Ryan , 1993 ; Clough , Shepherd , &; Maughan , 1989 ; Gill &; Overdorf , 1994 ; Gill et al. , 1996 ; Koivula , 1999 ; Markland &; Hardy , 1993 ; Silberstein , Striegel-Moore , Timko , &; Rodin , 1988 ) . This is closely related to the theoretical considerations of the female body as a sexual object that is valued for its static attractiveness and ornamental values . <p> The features that have instead been suggested to prompt perception of a sport as masculine are snore diverse , consisting of characteristics of rules of the sport , features of the attitudinal mode , the identification of men as a group that is distinct from women , and the requirements that participants possess physical capacities related to speed and strength . A sport can be seen as masculine even though it does not consist of all the separate features of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport has , the more masculine it is probably perceived . As Table 2 demonstrates , the sports which were considered as the most masculine in earlier studies ( Koivula , 1995 ; Matteo , 1986 ) - for example football , ice hockey and rugby - seem to be perceived as characterized by I ) danger , risk , and violence ; 2 ) team spirit ; 3 ) speed ; 4 ) strength and endurance ; and 5 ) masculinity . <p> Boxing , motor sports , and weight lifting , are also sports considered to be highly masculine . These sports differ from those mentioned above in that they are not , for obvious reasons , characterized by team spirit . Weight lifting is notable because although it has a relatively high score on strength and endurance , it only reaches a score that is higher than 5 on only one scale , namely scale ten , Masculinity . This is one of the sports in which the definition of athletic excellence is defined on the basis of a quality for which men have a statistical advantage over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceived lack of both aesthetic pleasure and femininity , justify the assigning of a masculinity label to the sport , men 's advantage over women in physical strength seem to be enough to place the sport in the " masculine " category . However , in weight lifting body size is considered as an important factor and weight lifters compete in different body weight classes . ! f the different classes were based not on body mass but on lean body mass , women could probably compete successfully with men . An interesting question is whether a change from body mass to lean body mass as the basis for division into different classes would change the perceived masculinity of the sport . <p> Motor sports are dominated by male competitors and the spectators are predominantly male . These sports are considered masculine , as shown by earlier findings ( Koivula , 1995 ; Matteo , 1986 ) and in the present study the mean score on the masculinity scale was high . As can be seen in Table 2 , the perceptions of motor sports are dominated by the characteristics challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as by masculinity , speed , and lack of aesthetics and femininity . This suggests that two additional features could be added to the list of proposed features that might serve as a basis for the classifying of a sport as masculine : ! ) the use of a vehicle that has a masculine connotation , such as a car or a motorbike ; and 2 ) perceived high risk and danger . Perhaps the perception of high risk and danger for sports such as mountaineering and surfing , are the reasons for many , and especially gender-typed men , to categorize these sports as masculine ( Koivula , 1995 ; Matteo , 1986 ) . <p> The performed ANOVAs on the 12 factor-based scales revealed that the ratings of ' the three sportcategories differed on the basis of several characteristics . The ANOVAs did not , however , reveal any statistically significant gender differences . Only on scale eight , Strength and Endurance , did the difference between men and women approach significance , indicating a tendency for women to generally give higher ratings for strength and endurance to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gender and sportcategory that was found for scale eleven , Excitement and Challenge , was also interesting . The mean ratings displayed in Table 3 , show that men and women differed especially in their perceptions of sports labeled as feminine . Women perceived feminine sports as more exciting and challenging than masculine sports , and the male respondents showed the opposite pattern . This could explain the finding that women in general are more interested in watching women 's sports , and especially feminine sports , whereas men are more interested in watching men 's sports ( Cooper-Chen , 1994 ; Fasting &; Tangen , 1983 ; Guttman , 1986 ) . <p> The reason for this difference in men 's and women 's perceptions of sports could be a result of several factors , such as greater familiarity with gender-appropriate sports , identification with the participants , and the presentation of oneself as a gendered individual distinct from the other gender . The latter could be related to findings in a study about gender differences in the consumption of television wrestling programs , it was suggested that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ( WWF ) programs served to reinforce their gender identity and to present them as distinctly different from boys ( Lemish , 1998 ) . So , through showing interest in gender-appropriate sports and less interest in gender-inappropriate sports , females and males can present themselves as gendered individuals who belong to separate gender categories . <p> The respondents were in the present study asked to rate their perceptions of the characteristics and requirements of a sport and its participants . It was not investigated whether the respondents were thinking of a female or a male athlete when they did their ratings . The answer to that question might have provided further information about how participants of certain sports are perceived . Furthermore , as has been shown in several studies regarding media coverage of female and male athletes , sports in which women participate are gender-marked to a much higher degree than sports in which men participate ( Duncan , Messner , Williams , &; Jensen , 1994 ; Halbert &; Latimer , 1994 ) . A possible direction for future research on the issue would be to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as soccer , but also to rate gender-marked sports , such as men 's soccer and women 's soccer , to see if the perceived characteristics of a sport varies with the gender of the participant . <p> Because it has been shown that there are differences in the categorizations of sports as feminine and masculine due to gender-typing ( Koivula , 1995 ) , some of the variance in the perceived features of different sports might reflect variations in how strongly the individual has adopted stereotypical beliefs related to gender , it is possible that gender-typed individuals who are more prone to categorize sports on the basis of gender also perceive different characteristics of sports and/or relate the perceived characteristics more strongly to other traditional expectations regarding femininity and masculinity . <p> The sample in the present study consisted of students from different disciplines , including physical education students . The sample was selected to ensure that the respondents had a variety of experiences of different sports , it is possible that an individual 's experience with sports could influence the ratings . The samples in the present study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experience of sports , it is nevertheless an issue well worth investigating in future studies . <p> In conclusion , the findings of the present study have shown that sports categorized as gender-neutral , feminine , and masculine , are generally perceived as different . However , there are variations within the sportcategories that indicate that additional features should be incorporated into the list of features or clusters of features that Metheny ( 1965 ) and Postow ( 1980 ) have suggested to serve as the bases for the gender-typing of sports . Such features include those that relate to the purpose of the sport ( such as shaping the body ) and to the perceived risk of the sport , and the use of vehicles associated with masculine values .
