The Rocky Road to Romance Chapter One Daisy Adams was an enterprising twenty-six-year- old graduate student . She 'd written a cookbook called Bones for Bowser , and somehow , through sheer tenacity , she 'd managed to turn a gimmick into a five-minute slot on WZZZ every Monday morning . She filled her airtime with dog stories and gave detailed directions on how to make homemade dog biscuits , dog soup , and dog stew . She 'd become the darling of the morning DJs on the FM stations , who made her the brunt of their jokes , referring to her as the " Dog Lady of Snore , " hitting on a tender subject for Steve Crow and his unfortunate luck in call letters . A few wisps of bangs straggled over her forehead , tortoiseshell combs held her blond hair swept back from her temples , and big , loose curls tumbled in a luxuriant mass down the back of her head and neck to an inch below her shoulders . Her eyes were big and blue , her nose small , her mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was completely misleading because there was n't an ounce of gamine in her personality . Her ex-boyfriend had compared her to Attila the Hun , but most people thought she was more like the human version of the Little Engine That Could . At ten-fifteen Daisy swung into the newsroom . She waved hello to the anchor in the glass booth and gave the Capitol Hill correspondent a bag of experimental snacks for his beagle . She adjusted the strap on her oversized shoulder bag and dropped into a seat beside the editor . " What happened to Frank ? I heard him giving the traffic report while I was driving in . He said a rude word and that was the last of him . " " Rear-ended a garbage truck and got buried under half a ton of Dumpster droppings . He 's okay except for a broken leg . " Daisy pulled a five-by-seven card from her pocketbook and glanced over a recipe for dog granola . " That 's too bad . Who 's doing traffic ? " " Nobody 's doing traffic . Steve 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Girl Scout cookies , but nobody 'll take it . " Daisy felt her heart jump . Double Frank 's salary ! " I could do it , " she said . " I need the money . " " You need money that bad ? " She bit her lower lip to keep herself under control . This was the chance of a lifetime . She had enormous school expenses , a big rent payment due , a live-in little brother who was eating her out of house and home , and a car that drank a quart of motor oil a week . She was determined to make it on her own . Besides her dog lady job , she worked as a school crossing guard , a cab driver , a waitress on the dinner shift at Roger 's Steak House , and delivered newspapers . She 'd written Bones for Bowser to give herself additional income , but she was n't due a royalty check for three more months . If she took the traffic job , she could drop waitressing . Maybe she could even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissertation for her doctorate , and she could work on it at night . She swiveled in her seat and looked across the room at Steve Crow . She 'd always been a little frightened of him . With his jet-black hair , dark , piercing eyes , and slightly aquiline nose , he was an intimidating figure . His complexion was dark , his shoulders broad , his hips narrow . The scuttlebut at the station said his father was pure-blood Native American ; his mother was Hispanic . Nervously , Daisy waved at him with just the tips of her fingers . He scowled back and immediately averted his eyes to some pressing piece of business on his desk . She sighed . Stubborn , she thought . She 'd nagged him for a month before he gave her the five-minute Bowser spot . She wondered what she 'd have to do to get the traffic job . Nothing ventured nothing gained , she told herself , pushing the hair out of her eyes . She might as well give it a try . " Excuse me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd like to talk to you about the job of traffic reporter . I 'd like to apply for it ... just until Frank 's leg is better . I would n't want to steal his job . Even if I was wonderful , which I 'm sure I 'll be , I still would n't expect you to keep me on . Actually , the timing is perfect because I 'll get a royalty check in three months and then hopefully I wo n't need so many jobs . " Steve looked beyond her , to his secretary eavesdropping through the glass window . He watched Charlene mouth the word " perfect " to him , watched her eyes fill with suppressed laughter . He lifted an eyebrow , and she scuttled away . Perfectly awful , he thought . Putting Daisy Adams in the WZZZ traffic car was like committing broadcasting suicide . The woman was cute , but her specialty was baking dog biscuits , for crying out loud . True , she received more fan mail than everyone else combined , but that was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of earnest and goofy all at the same time . Unfortunately , he had no other option . He 'd gone through six traffic reporters in the past year trying to find a backup . At least she would n't be doing rush hour , he told himself . How bad could she be ? Without waiting for his reply , Daisy added , " And do n't worry about my Bones for Bowser spot . I can do it on the road ! " He managed a small smile . " Terrific . " Ten minutes later they were in the Shulster Building parking garage . " Wow ! " Daisy said , looking at the station 's auxiliary newscar . " It 's got enough antennae to get Mars . This is going to be incredible . I think I 'm going to like this . " She cracked her knuckles , looked up into Steve Crow 's face , and felt a shiver run along her spine . She was n't a shy sort of person , and she was n't usually uncomfortable with men ...   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
