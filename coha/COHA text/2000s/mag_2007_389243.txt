Headnote EXTREME MAKEOVER On an unusually warm morning in Washington , D.C. , last spring , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice stood before a pack of reporters for a briefing , one of Africa 's most notorious dictators at her side . Rice was her usual assured self , answering questions in thoughtful paragraphs . The man with her-Teodoro Obiang , president of the tiny , oil-rich nation of Equatorial Guinea-seemed less comfortable . As the journalists peppered Rice with questions , he clenched his hands against his suit coat and stared at her with a tight , puzzled grin . During his two-decade reign of torture and terror , Obiang has never faced such meddlesome media ; Equatoguinean radio has declared that Obiang has " permanent contact with the Almighty " and therefore can " kill anyone without being called to account . " Rice turned to Obiang . " Thank you very much for your presence here , " she cooed . " You are a good friend , and we welcome you . " It was a moment so unsettling that State Department officials privately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not meant to be so effusive . But for Cassidy and Associates , a prominent D.C. lobbying and communications firm , the secretary 's comments were payoff for years of hard work . Since 2004 , according to Department of Justice reports , Equatorial Guinea has paid Cassidy and Associates at least $120,000 per month to overhaul the country 's image . At times , Cassidy almost functions as a shadow foreign ministry for Equatorial Guinea . One longtime Africa observer says that at a recent D.C. event , he saw Cassidy staffers flanking the Equatoguinean ambassador passing her notes throughout her speech . " She was literally in the hands of her handlers , " he says . Cassidy has also helped set up a social development fund to channel the country 's oil money into welfare projects : Obiang is intent on improving the country , " says Juan Carlos Benitez , who is responsible for Cassidy 's Equatorial Guinea account . Yet on the ground , improvements are hard to come by . Equatorial Guinea has one of the world 's highest incomes per capita , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , little of that money trickles down . Obiang rules the country with an iron fist : According to State Department reports , suspects have been tortured to death and prisoners raped by police . Still , Cassidy has delivered results for Obiang in D.C. " A few years ago , at least U.S. officials would n't talk about the relationship with Equatorial Guinea , or they would admit all the problems and horrible human rights abuses , " says Frank Ruddy , the former U.S. ambassador to Equatorial Guinea . Now , he adds , " you would have thought this is Mother Teresa 's brother running Equatorial Guinea . " Such makeovers are the result of sophisticated campaigns . In the past , dictatorships simply used lobbyists to court the mostly below-the-radar support of American politicians . But in the post-9/11 world of 24/7 media coverage of every human rights crackdown in Kazakhstan or every whisper of Saudi Arabia funding extremists , authoritarians need a different strategy-an intensive , crisis-management approach to PR . Like Angelina Jolie , who transformed her image from wild woman to paragon of charity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avenue to promote their new images . " The Saudis were the first to get this new era of PR , " says Kevin McCauley , editor of O'Dwyer 's Public Relations , the leading trade publication covering the PR industry . Shortly after 9/11 , Saudi Arabia entered into a $14 million-a-year contract with Qorvis , a Washington PR firm . Qorvis launched a TV campaign with ads on political talk shows featuring a procession of Saudi royals appearing alongside U.S. presidents , to highlight Riyadh as a close ally . Other TV spots , which ran in 14 American cities , touted the " shared values " of the United States and Saudi Arabia . The firm also shuttled Saudi officials on whirlwind tours of major media outlets , and broadcast ads promoting the 9/11 Commission finding that there was " no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded Al Qaeda " - while omitting the report 's conclusion that " Saudi Arabia has been a problematic ally in combating Islamic extremism . " The PR blitz helped reduce the number of anti-Saudi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush administration to keep ties to the kingdom close . Other countries saw how this worked , " notes McCauley , and in the wake of the Saudi contract , several authoritarian regimes beefed up their PR efforts . In 2002 , petro state Qatar hired PR and lobbying firm Rahall Consulting Group to promote its commitment to democracy , though Qatar has no real opposition party . Rahall 's owner , Tanya Rahall , is the sister of Rep. Nick Rahall ( D-W . Va. ) , who , after the contract was signed , offered congressional resolutions praising Qatar 's " democratic reform . " Uganda hired public relations giant Hill &; Knowlton to bat down criticism of its atrocious human rights record . Kazakhstan , where President Nursultan Nazarbayev won more than 90 percent of the vote in a widely criticized election , ran a U.S. advertising campaign touting itself as a " developing democratic country . " Even the genocidal Sudanese government tried to get into the action , spending $530,000 on a firm called C/R International , run by a former State Department official , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Sudan was " cooperating in the war on terrorism . " The deal was canceled in the face of public scrutiny . Nation rebranding has become so common it even has inspired its own academic discipline , including a journal called Place Branding , in which professors pen lengthy , footnoted discourses on topics such as " How Can a Place Correct a Negative Image ? " Sometimes , such PR campaigns do more than put lipstick on a dictator . In the case of Libya , the PR firms and advisers pushed for real reform-partly because some top Libyan officials , including the son of Moammar Qaddafi , apparently also supported change . In February 2006 , one of those advisers , Michael Porter , presented his report on Libya 's economic and political decay to an audience of 1,500 Libyan officials and businessmen , who greeted his findings of corruption and a privileged plutocracy with applause . Porter 's researchers later met with Qaddafi himself and urged him to undertake political reforms and open the economy . Though Libya remains a dictatorship that jails some dissidents , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and allowed in Human Rights Watch , which-while remaining overwhelmingly critical of the regime-has praised Tripoli for gradually moving toward greater freedom . PR firms claim that the Libya case is not unique : " Our firm really said to leaders , " This is what you need to do . " The whole idea was to encourage them to reform , " says Adwoa Dunn-Mouton , who represented African governments such as Cameroon while working for the Washington Strategic Consulting Group , Inc . Donald Steinberg , a former ambassador to Angola , says that during his tenure , the regime 's PR firm had more success than he did in persuading the government to make changes . " They could deliver a message we could n't , " he says . Still , Libya may be the exception ; most rebranding is focused on making it easier for rogues to do business with the White House . And it works : Kazakhstan 's Nazarbayev won a meeting with President Bush last September . After employing three PR firms and various policy consultants , Azerbaijan 's strongman , Ilham Aliyev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Bush subsequently announced that Aliyev " understands that democracy is the wave of the future . " If so , he has a long way to go : Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch recalls watching Aliyev 's " democracy " in action in 2003 . " The government clearly stole the election , and then brutally beat hundreds of people who poured out in the streets in protest . The day after the election , I watched from the roof of a hotel in Baku as thousands of riot police beat protesters unconscious . " - Joshua Kurlantzick <p>
