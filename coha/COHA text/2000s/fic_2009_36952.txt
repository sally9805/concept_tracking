" PLEASE LET me just look at it , " Jessica pleaded , tugging on Chad 's arm . <p> Chad pulled away , and moved his body over to the edge of the sofa . " No , " he said adamantly . <p> Jessica was a woman with determination , and was n't about to take " no " for an answer , she wanted him badly , and would do and say anything to get her way , especially tonight . She had n't seen Chad in months , since they had broken up , and was desperate for some much-needed sex . She had lured him over to her apartment under the guise of being a damsel in distress , telling him that there had been an attempted break-in , and that she needed her locks changed . He had insisted that she call a locksmith . She told him that she did , but could n't get anybody to come out on a Sunday . She feigned tears , saying that she was afraid and pleaded with him to change her locks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed . Before he got there , Jessica jimmied the locks with a screwdriver and cut the security chain . She then drank a few glasses of red wine to get in the mood , and waited for Chad to arrive . Now that he was there , her plan was n't going as smoothly as she had hoped . During their relationship , their sex life was explosive and they fucked at least three times a day . Jessica missed Chad 's dick , and wanted to relive old times . " Oh , baby , do n't be like that . All I want to do is have a look and say hello , " she purred , scooting closer to him and resting her hand on his thigh . <p> After Jessica had abruptly ended their relationship , Chad swore that he would never fall back into her arms . She had said at the time that she wanted her freedom , and did n't want to be committed anymore . He was deeply in love with her , and the breakup broke his heart , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to lure him back , and he was confused . " Look , Jessica , you 're the one who said that you did n't want a relationship , so what 's with this attempted seduction ? " <p> She ran her hand up to his crotch area and rested it on top of his full mound . " I was wrong , " she began , gently massaging his package . " I want you back . We were so good together , " she said , increasing her pace . <p> Chad could n't deny their chemistry . She had one hell of a tight pussy , and he missed filling her up with his rod . He did n't want to give in to her so easily , but she was making his dick hard . He had n't been laid in weeks , and was horny as hell . He unzipped his pants and took out the head of his penis . " Is this what you want to see ? " <p> Jessica looked down and swallowed hard . The tip was big , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did n't say a word , but leaned over and licked him . She flicked her tongue back and forth , the way he liked it . <p> Chad began rotating his hips . She was driving him crazy . He wanted to fuck now . He knew that she was manipulating him , but did n't care . All he cared about at the moment was getting laid . He took the shaft of his dick all the way out so that she could deepthroat him . She was an expert at giving head , and he missed her mouth . " Yeah , that 's it , baby , do n't stop , " he moaned with pleasure . <p> She bobbed her head up and down , faster and faster . She could feel the tip of his dick hitting the back of her throat , but she did n't gag . She just continued sucking until she tasted his sweet pre-cum . <p> " Stop , " he breathed . " I want to be inside of you , " he said , laying her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Jessica wiggled out of her panties , kicked one leg over the back of the sofa , and gapped her legs wide open , inviting him in . <p> Chad quickly dropped his pants to the floor and eased in between her thick thighs  --  <p> <p> The phone rang before Naomi could finish reading the spicy love scene . She dog-eared the page and picked up the receiver . " Hello , " she said in a breathy voice . <p> " Were you exercising ? " Kennedy asked , picking up on her friend 's lack of oxygen . <p> " Girl , I was reading Auld Lang Syne , and the phone rang as soon as I got to the juicy part , " she explained , sounding slightly upset . <p> " I see you 're living vicariously through the pages of a book again , " Kennedy teased . Naomi 's husband , Jacob , usually worked late or was MIA on an overnight business trip , which translated to a love life that was also MIA . <p> " Unfortunately since my husband spends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ta get my thrills where I can , " she said with a chuckle , trying to make light of her loveless marriage . " But it 's not like you 're getting any either , " she shot back defensively . <p> Kennedy had n't been on a date in several months , not since she broke up with Lance the cop . They met one night when she was speeding down the Long Island Expressway . He pulled her over and instead of giving her a ticket , he gave her his telephone number and made her promise to call . Checking out his pecs through the blue , city-issued uniform , she thought , why not ? Lance was five feet eight inches of solid muscle and his face was n't bad to look at either . He was chocolate brown with ripe , succulent lips . She was weak for a brother with a delectable , kissable mouth . After her first call a few days later , it did n't take long for her to taste those lips . Their sexual chemistry was sizzling . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ignite a . re within her that would last until the wee hours of the morning . But the flame began to fizzle when she tried to move their relationship beyond the bedroom . Kennedy was an international flight attendant who traveled the world for mere pennies . She had companion passes and invited Lance on trips to Paris , Tahiti , and even to a four-star resort in South Africa , all of which he declined , saying the only place he was interested in traveling was south of her navel . Kennedy wanted more than sex , but as usual she had fucked him too soon , and now all he wanted to do was screw . Realizing that she was never going to get a commitment out of Lance , she ended the relationship as quickly as it began and vowed to reclaim her virginity until the proverbial Mr. Right showed up with the key to her chastity belt . <p> " Have you started reading Auld Lang Syne yet ? " Naomi asked , referring to their current book club selection . <p> Kennedy had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , picked up the novel from the nightstand , and dusted the cover with the sleeve of her robe . The jacket looked interesting enough ; an attractive couple dressed in black tie was locked in an intense embrace . The title was scrolled in gold foil . In smaller script the words " shall old acquaintances never be forgotten " was written across their bodies . " I have n't had a chance yet . I 've been flying so much that when I do have extra time , all I want to do is sleep . " <p> " Speaking of flying , was Mr. Cutie Patootie on your flight tonight ? " <p> Kennedy had completely put the Mystery Man out of her mind . The first time she had seen him was a month ago when he boarded a flight from New York to Johannesburg . He had sat in first class , which was her station . With the pastel pink pages of the Financial Times covering the lower half of his body , she barely caught a glimpse of his face as she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane reached a cruising attitude of thirty thousand feet , she returned to ask whether he wanted veal with rosemary and chive risotto or salmon on a bed of field greens . When he looked up from the newspaper to answer , what greeted her was a pair of sexy , smokey hazel eyes on reddish-brown cinnamon skin and a goatee framing a pair of lips that were even more succulent than her last lover 's . " Salmon , please , " he answered in a deep voice . Her knees almost buckled . She knew it was n't the air pocket they had just passed through but the sexy sound of his baritone voice . Giving no indication of attraction , she remained professional and returned with his meal . The rest of the flight was uneventful as he read one newspaper after the other and she serviced the other passengers . Kennedy had seen him once thereafter but he never even looked twice in her direction . Today 's flight should have been his usual bimonthly trip , but he had n't been on board . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one and only syllable . <p> " Did he ever say anything to you ? " <p> " You mean besides , ' Excuse me , miss , may I have another pillow ? ' " <p> Naomi cracked up laughing . " You know what I mean , " she said , after recovering from her laugh attack . " Did he ask for your number ? " <p> " He probably thinks I 'm a fixture of the plane . Most first-class passengers have that sense of entitlement . " <p> " You 're right , they are an elitist bunch , " Naomi agreed . " But I 'm sure he 's checked out how you rock that uniform , " she countered . <p> " Girl , I 'm not thinking about that man , " Kennedy said , picking up the Boiler Room DVD . The movie was old , but she did n't care . " I 've got to go because I have a date with Mr. Diesel . " <p> " Who 's that ? Did you meet him at work ? Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious to know who this new man was . <p> Kennedy chuckled , and then said , " Diesel as in Vin , the actor . " She absolutely loved looking at the man . <p> " Oh . It 's going to be another Blockbuster night , huh ? " Naomi asked , finally catching on . <p> " Yep , " she replied , sliding the disc into the player . " I 'll talk to you tomorrow , " Kennedy said before hanging up . <p> " Okay , enjoy your movie . " After Naomi hung up , she looked at the clock on the nightstand , wondering where her husband might be . <p> Excerpted from Naughty by Velvet <p> Copyright 2009 by velvet <p> Published in March 2008 by St.Martin
