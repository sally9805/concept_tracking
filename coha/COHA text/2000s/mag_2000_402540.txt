In Mexico 's Maya jungle , the survival of the Jaguar hangs on radio collars , hounds and former hunters <p> The tracks on the old logging road were unmistakable . A jaguar had passed through last night . Marks of a huge feline paw led from the road into la Selva Maya  --  a vast expanse of tropical forest stretching through southeastern Mexico , northeastern Guatemala and Belize . The five dogs were already in a frenzy , sniffing the scent of el tigre , as the jaguar is called . All of us on the team looked at Pancho Zavala , the man who manages the hounds . Some of us called him Don Pancho , out of respect for his extraordinary knowledge of this jungle . <p> Don Pancho would decide . <p> He did n't say a word . He just nodded to Cuauthemoc Chavez , the field biologist in charge . That was it . We were going to chase the jaguar and capture it . <p> The jaguar had used a nearby tree trunk as a scratching post , and his enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressive animal . Don Pancho warned us to prepare for a grueling chase . A male jaguar , he said , usually heads straight across country . The terrain was treacherous , with jagged limestone outcroppings underfoot , spiny vines and trees in dense undergrowth , and creatures like the fer-de-lance , the deadly poisonous pit viper . <p> No matter , we were eager to go . For nearly two weeks we had waited for this moment , getting up every day at 3:30 a.m. to patrol the nearly impassable road , looking for signs of the jaguar . I had joined this research team in early March , the beginning of the year 's capture season . Home base was an abandoned hunting camp in Calakmul Biosphere Reserve . The camp , called Costa Maya , was once a small family farm but is now part of the " core zone " within the reserve , where all human activities are prohibited except scientific studies . <p> Since 1997 , Gerardo Ceballos , an ecologist and professor at Universidad Nacional Auto-noma de Mexico ( UNAM ) , has codirected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Carlos Manterola , director general of Unidos para la Conservacion , who focuses on project coordination , conservation efforts and fundraising , and Tony Rivera , head of EcoSafaris , who manages all the field operations . <p> According to Ceballos , the forest in and around Calakmul probably contains the largest and densest population of jaguars north of Panama . The remote and rarely visited reserve in Campeche in southeastern Mexico covers nearly 1,787,000 acres and protects part of the largest surviving rain forest in the Americas outside the Amazon . The Calakmul Biosphere Reserve is one of the last refuges for endangered wildlife in Mexico , and one of the main reasons it was established in 1989 was to protect the jaguar habitat . <p> The jaguar ( Panthera onca ) is considered among the great cats of the world , the third biggest after the tiger and the lion , but it is the least studied of the large felids . Its spectacular spotted coat ranks it with nature 's most beautiful animals and , thus , among the most vulnerable . The jaguar is vanishing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Not many people have been lucky enough to glimpse , much less study , wild jaguars , making the Calakmul project all the more important . George Schaller and Peter Crawshaw initiated the first study of wild jaguars in Brazil in 1977 , but there have been few others . Radio collars have become the key to learning about these elusive predators . In Calakmul , the goal is to fit the cats in the Costa Maya area with radio collars and then track them , gathering data on their range , habitat needs and behavior . Ceballos and the other researchers want to use the knowledge they gain to manage the jaguar population properly . The jaguar is the " umbrella species " of the reserve , and saving its habitat will help protect all the fauna and flora of the region . <p> The jaguar is the perfect conservation symbol . A mythic animal with great imaginative allure , it has been a major presence in Latin American life . The Aztecs and the Maya revered it . As if to wrap themselves in the jaguar 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore jaguar skins and framed their human faces with the intimidating jaws of gaping jaguar mouths . In the temples of Teotihuacn not far from Mexico City , the jaguar has its own palace , with murals portraying the creature in feathered headdress . <p> Though the jaguar is an icon in Latin America 's identity , little is known about the cat . After two weeks of trying to find this particular male jaguar in Calakmul , I think I understand why . Jaguars are clever and powerful and mysterious . They are solitary and secretive , elusive in ways that suggest great intelligence . They thrive in the dense rain forests and are primarily nocturnal . And here in la Selva Maya , jaguars are the top predator . <p> Until recently , knowledge of the jaguar 's habits was based mainly on anecdotes from naturalists and hunters . Theodore Roosevelt , who tracked jaguars on an expedition to Brazil for the American Museum of Natural History in New York , called the jaguar " the king of South American game , ranking on an equality with the noblest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ techniques to capture the jaguar in Calakmul to help save the species . When Don Pancho gave the nod , everyone quickly readied for the chase . Chavez gathered the equipment , including the radio collar and antenna . Miguel Amn , a biologist studying jaguar prey species , and Javier Ojeda , a veterinarian , hustled the rest of the gear into their backpacks . To me , the most remarkable members of the capture team were the two perreros , or houndsmen . Fit and young , Valentn Daz and Lolo Riveros were local men whose job was to run through the jungle with the dogs . They were the team 's contact with the chase , essentially racing a frightened and fleeing jaguar . The men were also charged with protecting the dogs from getting wounded in a fight with the jaguar . <p> Don Pancho let the dogs go . In full cry , they disappeared in a heartbeat . They locked immediately onto the cat . Daz and Riveros streaked after them into the jungle . <p> The rest of us waited a moment and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest . We did not run or actually pursue the jaguar . We followed the dogs . More precisely , we followed the baying of the dogs . Don Pancho hacked away vines and soall trees with his machete , and we worked our way through the jungle , trying to keep the dogs within earshot . <p> Even that was difficult . They quickly outran us . We lost all contact with both runners and dogs . Don Pancho looked worried . Still , he kept us trudging forward . We never saw the jaguar or the dogs during the " chase , " and now we could n't hear them either . But Don Pancho led us where he imagined the jaguar might go , based on his experience with jaguars and the terrain . <p> For nearly an hour , we hiked along in silence , trying not to get discouraged . Then , faintly , we could hear a distant baying . A smile flickered across Don Pancho 's face . Our pace quickened . The sound of the dogs grew louder , more distinct . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The dogs were in one spot . Their baying , too , had changed , sliding into a high-pitched and frantic whining . <p> " Is the jaguar in a tree ? " I asked Don Pancho in Spanish . <p> " Parece , " he answered simply . " Seems so . " Remarkably , he had guessed right about where this jaguar would run . <p> It was another half hour before we reached the dogs . The sense of excitement as we approached the scene was unimaginable . I experienced a wave of eager anticipation , bordering on a kind of worried rush . I wanted desperately to see the jaguar before , somehow , it disappeared , and I 'd miss this chance of a lifetime . <p> The dogs had surrounded a huge tree . On one of the massive sloping trunks , a male jaguar in full view looked down on us . The five dogs were in a furor of unrestrained canine energy , yowling and leaping and racing around the tree . Sombra , the leader , was so excited that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the cat , only to fall off . The dogs ' wild clamor expressed the exhilaration we all shared . Tired and soaked with sweat , we looked at the jaguar and then at each other , smiling , savoring the joy of the moment . <p> And the concern I felt about seeing this jaguar was not misplaced . What happened next is one of the most vivid images I have of the entire experience . In one 20-foot leap , the jaguar flew from the tree and landed in the midst of the frenzied dogs . One more leap and the jaguar was gone , vanishing into the green brush . <p> Instantly , the dogs chased him into the jungle . And then , as if attached by some invisible force to the dogs , the runners raced to the same spot and quickly disappeared . <p> We were left with the eerie sensation that we had just witnessed the reason the jaguar is at once top predator and spectral creature of the jungle . To survive , the jaguar has mastered the skill of vanishing into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , the jaguar has become known for another kind of disappearing act . The range of jaguars once extended from the Southwestern United States-from Louisiana to California-through Mexico , Central America and the Amazon , to northern Argentina . That range is now broken up , and the jaguar is gone from El Salvador and Uruguay and faces extinction in several other Latin American countries . <p> In the Southwest , the jaguar has been virtually extirpated by predator control killing , but two recent sightings of transient males in 1996 raise hope for the future . Even more promising is the recent discovery of a resident population of jaguars about 130 miles south of the U.S. border in Sonora , Mexico . <p> In northern Mexico , however , the jaguar has disappeared from huge areas of its range . Hunting and habitat destruction have been the major cause of the species ' decline . In fact , Don Pancho once hunted el tigre , and his boss , Tony Rivera , was considered one of the region 's foremost jaguar hunters and guides . Trophy hunters from North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaguar . Now he describes himself as someone who wants only to help the species . Rivera is also a great storyteller with an infectious sense of humor . Describing his role in the project one evening in camp , he told me with a smile , " I 've been converted from a hunter of jaguars to a shepherd of jaguars . " <p> At the turn of the 19th century , about 4,000 jaguars a year were killed by hunters in Spanish-colonized Latin America ; 2,000 jaguar pelts were shipped annually to Europe from Buenos Aires . In the 20 years following World War II , Peru exported almost 13,000 skins . As recently as the late 1960s , the number of jaguar pelts reaching U.S. commercial markets each year reached 15,000 . Environmental scientist Norman Myers estimated that the international trade in spotted cat skins in the early ' 70s was worth $30 million . <p> It 's become a fashion cliche to link cats with beautiful women . As Catwoman in Batman Returns , Michelle Pfeiffer became the fantasy image of wild , feline sensuality . Spotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late ' 60s became a symbol of high fashion , with a top-quality jaguar coat fetching $20,000 . <p> It was largely hunting and exploitation in the commercial markets that led to the official protection for jaguars . In July 1975 the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) listed the jaguar as an Appendix I species , prohibiting commercial trade among signatory countries . In Mexico , the jaguar is officially endangered and hunting is illegal . <p> Unfortunately , when large sums of money are involved in poor countries , illegal hunting continues to be a problem . According to Rivera , it 's no longer a major issue in the Calakmul area , though locals may kill a jaguar if they encounter one in the jungle . There has been so little farming and ranching in the region because of poor soil conditions and water scarcity that the killing of livestock by jaguars has not been the problem it has been in other Latin American countries . But that may change , as recently people have been pouring into the areas around Calakmul . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a living . According to Ceballos , the government has encouraged thousands of people to move to the area , putting enormous pressure on the forests outside the protection of the reserve . There are now 52 communities around Calakmul with some 25,000 people . Ceballos expects the number to double in 25 years . They are cutting down the forest , trying to farm and ranch . <p> Deforestation and fragmentation of habitat have become serious problems throughout Latin America . According to Ceballos , nearly 990,000 new acres of forest are lost every year in Mexico , and 50 percent of the original tropical forest cover is already gone . One study estimates that in Mexico and Central America , jaguars now occupy only about 33 percent of their original range . " We may have won some environmental battles in Mexico , " Ceballos said to me , " but right now , we 're losing the war . " <p> Even the Calakmul study is an example of the special efforts that must be made in many developing countries on behalf of the environment . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ la Conservacion ( United for Conservation ) . The jaguar study requires huge resources , and Unidos raises the money from private sources . The only funding from the government is Ceballos ' university salary . The project is a model for wildlife projects in other parts of Latin America , where conservation and environmental issues in less affluent countries can fall low on a government 's long list of priorities . <p> The major problem of all jaguar studies is the same ; the cat is very difficult to capture and track . Most studies have been based on observations of very few animals over relatively short periods of time . " It 's hard to build a meaningful database , " Ceballos said . The goal of the Calakmul study is to capture jaguars and pumas and follow them for several years . Adding pumas to the study helps researchers better understand how the two species of big cats share the habitat . <p> This year began successfully with collars on eight jaguars-more than in any other study , Manterola told me . The project is also into its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As we chased the jaguar through the jungle a second time , the race was not as long or as arduous . The jaguar climbed another big tree about a third of a mile away and hid behind a dense cover of leaves . Through a small opening in the leaves , I could barely see his golden face and peering eyes . <p> Chavez readied the dosage of Ketamine , and Don Pancho fired a dart filled with the drug into the jaguar 's rump . Once we were able to get the jaguar to the ground , the biologists quickly got to work . The cat measured just over six feet in length including his tail ; his legs were nearly two feet from shoulders to paws , and the circumference of his head was about a foot and a half . He weighed 125 pounds . <p> But what these numbers can not convey is the pure physicality of the jaguar . Apart from its stunningly beautiful markings , the overwhelming first impression of the wild jaguar at close range is its size . This jaguar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy and muscular . While I was with the research team in Calakmul , we also captured three pumas and put radio collars on them . They were also impressive , but the jaguar was twice the weight of a puma in a body proportionately more compact and stocky . <p> With massive jaws , and fangs the size of my little finger , the jaguar was made for overpowering prey with one crushing bite to the throat or skull . I lifted one of his paws , and it was as big as my wide-open hand , revealing the same huge claws , I thought , that slashed up the tree by the road . <p> For all his physical presence , he lay before us as beautiful and peaceful as a dream . His coat had a satiny gloss to it , a tawny gold , paling to a creamy white on his belly , throat and chin . And his magnificent spots were like paw prints laid across his back , rough and irregular black circles called rosettes . They gradually coalesced toward face and legs and belly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Rorschach pattern of bold black splotches on his creamy white fur . <p> Even as we worked , we fell under the spell of this sleeping cat . Drawn by the creature 's irresistible beauty , each of us laid our hands on his fur and stroked it . The fur was short and coarse . The muscles , warm and strong , gave a molded feel to the body . <p> Though the jaguar species of Central America are typically smaller than those of South America , they are much larger than their local prey , mainly collared peccaries , armadillos , coati and deer . <p> With the radio collar in place and screwed on , Chavez checked the signal . This jaguar became frequency number 411.2 on the dial . We gently lifted the jaguar to a safe place under the tree to wake up . Don Pancho and the two houndsmen hid out of sight with the dogs to wait . The rest of us stayed near the sleeping cat . <p> During this year 's capture season , two new jaguars have been caught and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was recaptured and fitted with a new one . There is now a total of ten jaguars that have been captured and collared at Calakmul . Of these , at least four-two males and two females-are known to be resident cats . Four are considered transients , since they disappeared after their capture . The two new ones are being closely watched to determine if they are residents . <p> The jaguars and pumas are tracked several times a week from a Jeep , from three high radio towers built on hills in the forest and from aerial surveys . Ceballos and Chavez are learning much about the jaguars-their home range and territory , breeding seasons , movement patterns and social interactions . The four resident jaguars have home ranges within a 23-square-mile area , and their territories overlap . Ceballos estimates that in Calakmul there is about one jaguar for every 6 to 11.5 square miles . <p> " That estimate coincides with other studies , " Ceballos told me . Extrapolating these figures to the suitable habitat in Calakmul , Ceballos estimates the population in the reserve to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total population of jaguars throughout the entire Maya forest to range from 1,000 to 2,000 animals . But unless these cats are protected more effectively , they could be lost . Reserves will not guarantee their survival if the habitat outside their boundaries deteriorates . According to Ceballos , there is just one other nature reserve in the Maya region-in Guatemala-capable of supporting up to 400 jaguars , which makes the Calakmul reserve extremely valuable . The other seven reserves are smaller and only capable of supporting about 50 jaguars . <p> " We need a system of corridors connecting these reserves , " Ceballos said , " to avoid the loss of small populations . We have a conservation opportunity now , before the jaguar is a conservation emergency . " <p> Though many worry that the jaguar 's future prospects are not good , Carlos Manterola was optimistic about protecting the Calakmul jaguars . " If we manage them right , " he said , " we can at least keep the most viable population of jaguars in Central America alive for the long-term . " <p> Manterola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area involves working with the local people . With the population booming , the forests and jaguar habitats outside the reserve are being lost to farming and cattle ranching . " These people are new to the area , " Manterola insisted . " They have no traditions with the land and do n't know how to live with jaguars . We need to change people 's hostile attitudes toward jaguars and find new solutions that give an equitable balance to both people and wildlife . " <p> As we waited deep in the jungle of Calakmul for the jaguar to wake up from the tranquilizer , I could not help but reflect on the incredible richness of this reserve , home to some 550 species of vertebrates , 92 of them mammals . Ceballos told me there are about 40 species of bats . Of the approximately 300 species of birds , many are rare or endangered . During our morning walks we had caught a glimpse of such spectacular tropical rain forest species as ocellated turkey , two species of tinamou ( strange chickenlike creatures of the jungle ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal flycatcher with an orange crest like nothing I 'd ever seen . One morning I saw a nesting pair of ornate hawk-eagles soaring above the anopy-stunning and crested and rare . <p> I crouched behind a small bush and watched the jaguar slowly regain consciousness . He lifted his head heavily , then rested it again on the dry leaves of the forest floor . His body was stretched out , his front legs extended . I was sorry for the stress we had caused this jaguar . Yet the information he would supply to Ceballos and the others compensated for his capture . <p> After about an hour and a half , Chavez and the others approached the jaguar cautiously to check on his recuperation . We had shared this jaguar 's company for almost three hours . As they stepped near , he suddenly reared up , roared loudly and lunged at them . They jumped back . The jaguar chased them a few feet and stopped . I sat in place , for some reason unafraid . The jaguar glared at me . I looked into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The entire world of Calakmul was contained in his eyes . <p> After several minutes , the jaguar slowly stood up , turned and ambled a bit unsteadily away from us . We watched him walk into the jungle , but this time he did not vanish . With the radio collar attached to his neck , he began his new career , helping to preserve the jaguars and all the other creatures of la Selva Maya . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Mesoamerican cultures venerated the jaguar , as evidenced by the Aztec stone sculpture . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A young female has been chased up a tree by hounds , where she can be safely tranquilized by dart and then weighed , measured and fitted with a radio collar . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Christian Dior designed this outfit in 1969 before the jaguar pelt trade wass prohibited . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : After a successful chase , a hound is muzzled to prevent it from barking while the treed jaguar calms down . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that make it , in proportion to its size , the most powerful of the big cats : well-developed jaw muscles and sharp canines . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A large male , sporting a new radio collar , slowly wakes up after being tranquilized deep in the forest of the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : In the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve , this Jaguar is one of the cats being tracked to study behavior and range . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Charles Bergman <p>
