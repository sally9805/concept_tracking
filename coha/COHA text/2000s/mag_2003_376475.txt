The trouble with books is that they 're too low-tech . Like all wood-pulp devices , they have no built-in search engine . Sure , you can look up stuff in the index . But who has the time ? Certainly not the generation that is growing up with Google . According to a 2001 Pew Research Center study , 71% of online teens rely " mostly on the Internet " for their homework . As the pace of life grows faster , the tendency is to shun any information that is n't delivered fresh and piping hot to our computer screens within seconds . And that means books lose out . <P> At least it did until Jeff Bezos intervened . On Oct. 23 , the Amazon.com CEO ( and TIME 's 1999 Person of the Year ) unveiled a new feature called Search Inside the Book . Amazon had spent the spring and summer digitally scanning 33 million pages  --  that is , every page from more than 120,000 in-print titles  --  and putting them in a vast searchable computer archive . Before on Amazon you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the chagrin of some authors , you can pinpoint a text reference on the very page where it appears and call it up in a jiffy . At a stroke , the world of wood pulp and the world of wired information just merged . <P> Of course , Bezos is not running the archive as some kind of nonprofit virtual library . He 's improving our access to books because he wants to sell us more of them . Only registered Amazon customers may use the service ( registration is free but a credit-card number is required ) . Even the most determined searchers will not be allowed to see more than 20% of any single book . The idea is to turn us all into bibliophiles by showing just how many authors have written about whatever topic we desperately need to know more about . The first few pages are free . Once you 're hooked , you 'll have to charge it at the checkout . <P> Still , the Search Inside the Book archive is a stunning achievement . Those 120,000 titles are about as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store . Even with the best cataloging system and the most helpful staff , tracking down every instance of a subject by browsing the stacks could take years . Like Steve Jobs with his iTunes Music Store , Bezos had to negotiate a maze of copyright issues and publishing-house egos to get his digital archive off the ground . Some writers in the cooking and travel genres fear a whole new kind of literary Napster situation . They say readers will too easily crib a recipe or city description without buying the book . They may have a point . Then again , how hard is it to scribble down a recipe while standing in the cooking aisle at Barnes &; Noble ? <P> To offer us the inside of every book , Amazon has a long way to go : the Library of Congress holds 19 million tomes , and about 3 million are in print . But Bezos is off to a blazing start . To go the distance , he 's appealing to authors ' dreams of immortality . Let us digitize your work of genius , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it forever . Soon Amazon hopes to start its own publishing service , serving up fresh copies of any title the moment you ask for it . The phrase out of print could soon lose its meaning . And the Google generation might get a lot more interested in wood pulp .  --  By Chris Taylor
