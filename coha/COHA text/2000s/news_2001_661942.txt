<p> They are united by language , but do not always understand each other . They came to America ages ago , and yesterday . They are of every race , yet passionately claim to be their own race , or even none . <p> The story of the new and unfolding census so far is the story of Hispanic growth . <p> But the question of who Hispanics really are - what this riotous quilt of 20-plus national origins has in common and does not - can not be answered by any head count , even one as curious as the census . <p> Imelys Samsores , 19 , born of Mexican and Cuban parents , takes a stab at the question while batting away unruly red , green and white balloons - the colors of Mexico 's flag - at a windy multicultural festival outside Miami . <p> " We all have different cultures and traditions but in the end we are all Hispanic , " said the political science student at Florida International University . <p> Rudy Cipiano , 28 , of Dallas , sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholly distinct from those of all other Latinos . <p> " I deal a lot with Puerto Ricans and Cubans , " says the banker , " and we clash . " <p> Imagine telling the story of Elian Gonzalez to this varied group . <p> Maria Elena Salinas , news anchor for the Spanish-language Univision TV network , did just that during the weeks that the Cuban boy was in the home of his Miami relatives and the embrace of Cuban-Americans everywhere . <p> " It was a challenge explaining to West Coast Mexican-Americans why this story was so important , " she said , " when thousands of Mexican children are deported each year . " <p> A sense of family and community : If one thing unites the many Hispanic cultures besides language and the Roman Catholic faith , that may be it . <p> " The family ties are much stronger , " says Marcela Ogle , 40 , who came to Miami from Peru in 1989 . <p> Isabel Valdes , an immigrant from Chile and one of America 's top Hispanic marketing strategists , agrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products with that in mind . <p> Family is a much more common subject in Spanish advertising than in English commercials , where individuality rules , she says . <p> But there are keen differences among Hispanics , too . <p> After Valdes tests advertising themes in California and Florida , she holds her breath until she sees how they play in Texas , where Hispanics dress , entertain themselves and live in distinct ways . <p> " If you survive the San Antonio test , you have a successful campaign , " she said . <p> Marketing peanuts is a challenge by itself . Some Hispanics know peanuts by the native Indian-derived word cacahuete . To other Hispanics , " caca " suggests dirty diapers . <p> America 's Hispanic population has ballooned almost 60 percent in the past decade , surpassing 35 million , according to the census . Hispanics make up 12.5 percent of the population now . <p> The Washington Post reported in its Sunday editions that census officials now think the number of illegal residents in the United States may be 9 million , or maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated . <p> While not attributing all of it to Hispanics , the paper said analysts think the higher number of undocumented immigrants could be partially explained by the fact that the 35.3 million Hispanics counted was considerably higher than the 32.5 million the government had estimated were in the United States . <p> Just as striking as the extent of the growth is its breadth . Latinos are seeking safe neighborhoods in Iowa , poultry plant jobs in northern Alabama and opportunities in other places far from the Spanish-American mainstreams . <p> In these areas , just as much as in the American barrios , some Hispanics are drawn together even if the countries they came from are a thousand miles apart . <p> " We do have our differences but for the most part we can relate together , " says Elizabeth Salinas-Newby , 53 , of Des Moines , Iowa , whose mother was a Mexican migrant . " We do stick together when we need to . " <p> In Reading , Pa. , Javier Ortega-Benitez , 36 , tells people who come into his insurance office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He ends up doing more . <p> " Sometimes I do translations , sometimes I have to call and arrange appointments for doctors , " he said . " We end up doing a little bit of psychotherapy , a little bit of social work . " He was born in Puerto Rico . <p> In Arkansas , where the Hispanic population in the past decade quadrupled , Marilly Mendez , 25 , who left Mexico at age 14 , places much stock in her ethnicity . <p> Mendez , nine months pregnant , said her child will learn Spanish first . " My child is going to know that his parents are Hispanic and we are going to try to teach him to respect our native country as much as this country , " she said in Little Rock . <p> But in Philadelphia , Abigail Castro , 17 , fluently bilingual daughter of Puerto Ricans , favors English TV and expresses little commonality with other Hispanics . <p> " I do n't seek out friends who are from Puerto Rico , " she said . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Hispanics have centuries of experience in the blending of cultures in the place once named Nuestra Senora la Reina de Los Angeles de Porciuncula ( Our Lady the Queen of the Angels of Porciuncula ) . <p> It is Los Angeles now . Hispanics make up an estimated 44 percent of Los Angeles County ; firm census numbers are still to come . <p> " I watch talk shows and soap operas in Spanish , movies in English and news in both , " said Maria C. Nava , 32 , having lunch with white , black and Hispanic co-workers in Monterey Park 10 miles east of downtown Los Angeles . <p> Nava , who came from Mexico 15 years ago , said Hispanics from different countries have much in common . <p> " First of all , there 's the language , " she said . " And a lot of food is named different , but it 's the same . Quesadillas are called everything and even beans have different names in different places . " <p> She munched on a hot pastrami sandwich . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being transformed - again - by newcomers . <p> Asians have shown the most growth in New York City . But Hispanics are enlarging their presence , too , now making up 27 percent of the population . <p> Hector DeJesus , 64 , leaned against a stoop near the corner of 102nd Street and Lexington Avenue and gestured to sounds and activity around him - signs and voices in Spanish , Mexican and Dominican eateries . <p> " Thirty years ago , you would have had none of this here , " said DeJesus , who moved from Puerto Rico at age 10 . " All of a sudden everyone 's coming . " <p> Finding common ground for all people of the Western Hemisphere who are broadly considered Hispanic - descendants of Spain and Portugal , and aboriginals who took their language and some of their ways - is a struggle . <p> " Day by day , one story at a time , one word at a time , " said Salinas . The Univision anchor was born in Los Angeles to Mexican parents . <p> Sometimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English term , she will use English with a Spanish explanation : " surgeon general " is an example . <p> Valdes , the marketer , says well-off Hispanic women in Texas probably have more in common with other well-off Texas women than they do with other Hispanics anywhere . <p> Cuban Americans , from a baseball-crazy island , know who Babe Ruth was . Valdes , from soccer-mad Chile , once thought Babe Ruth the baseball great and Baby Ruth the chocolate bar were the same thing . <p> That variety in experience and background exists within distinct races , too , and many Hispanics say they should have been categorized as a race on the census form . Some refused to check off any race at all . <p> It was all bewildering to Martin Carrasco , 37 , a sales clerk who was born in the United States , raised in Mexico and moved to Dallas three years ago . <p> " I 'm just a human being living in a complicated world , " he said , shrugging . " People complicate things too much .
