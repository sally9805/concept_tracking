In a traveling exhibition that debuted at MOMA , Gursky 's huge , often digitally manipulated photographs reveal his consistent interest in massed details of forms and movement seen from afar .

Photos courtesy Matthew Marks Gallery and Museum of Modern Art , New York . // Andreas Gursky 's Stockholder Meeting , Diptych ( 2001 ) is the product of a complex and labor-intensive process . Two large panels of digitally convened figures represent some of Germany 's largest corporations at an annual meeting that could never be , with a rapt and ghostly audience that fans out in seats ranked along the diptych 's base . Their lines of sight lead upward to a disconcerting central mass of snow-encrusted granite . Assembled groups of corporate leaders seated at long tables are ranged above the audience as though set into the mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final entry in a midcareer retrospective of the Dusseldorf-based photographer , organized by Peter Galassi for the Museum of Modern Art . The show was a welcome sign for the present and future department of photography as the museum resumed its curatorial engagement with the contemporary realm following its twoyear cycle of collection-based shows seeA.i.A. , May ' ' 01 . In Gursky 's digitally composed Valhalla , a few of those assembled confer with one another , while others puzzle at their podiums , waiting for some corporate benediction so the business of their convention might begin . Their names appear before them on plaques . A cheerless row of decorative geraniums extends along the base of one section , and ferns along another . Corporate logos hover like Pentecostal tongues in a cloudless sky above . It was widely known that Gursky had been occupied for months with the logistics of producing this final entry . Ample buzz forecast that some sort of ambitious picture dealing with the convergence of economic power might appear in time for the exhibition . Its inclusion was contingent on Gursky 's ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow , liberate the panels from the laboratory in Germany , and get them mounted , framed and shipped on time.1 Although the eventuality was perhaps never very much in doubt for those with confidence in Gursky 's determination , this diptych became prematurely freighted with the burden of representing the artist at his highest pitch : a genius loose in the halls of corporate titans , capturing and revealing the very face of power . In the polyglot hubbub that was part of the experience of repeated visits to the galleries , viewers stopped to figure out this work . Some seemed uncomfortable with the technology that had helped to create this cut-and-pasted Rushmore , voicing uncertainty about its implications . They drew close to examine the details , and they jockeyed for viewing distance to grasp the whole of the two panels , each roughly 6 by 8% feet . ( Gursky 's works are large , as much as 16 feet in length and 8 or so feet high , but not " billboard " size , a recurrent hyperbolic description . ) Like the other works in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white margins of about 6 inches that impart the commanding presence of an object ; they are laminated to Plexiglas and finished with simple wooden frames . Gursky was born in Leipzig in 1955 and raised in Disseldorf , the son of professional advertising photographers Willy and Rosemarie Gursky and grandson of a portrait photographer , Hans Gursky . In 1977 he entered the Folkwangschule , Essen , the preeminent German school of photography . During a visit to New York in 1978 , Gursky met the photographer Thomas Struth , a student of Bernd and Hilla Becher . The Bechers are well known for their series of sharp-focus , black-and-white photographs involving rigorous pursuit of single categories of architectural subjects . Two years later , Gursky joined the small group of Becher students  --  consisting of Thomas Ruff , Tata Ronkholz , Candida Hofer and Petra Wunderlich-at the Dusseldorf Kunstakademie . The Bechers introduced him to the color work of Stephen Shore and Joel Sternfeld , U.S. photographers at the vanguard of the revival of the view camera . At the academy , he came to enjoy the support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ludwig Museum in Cologne ) , who introduced him to Jeff Wall and Dan Graham . Not following the Becher model , Gursky immediately began to work in color , favoring single iconic images . Since 1987 , Gursky has tended to shoot with a 4-by-5-inch or 5by-7-inch view camera in the interests of clarity of focus and sharpness of detail . While he is known for his large images , one of the earliest works in the exhibition , the 1984 alpine landscape Klausenpass , is a relatively modest 36 by 32 inches or so , framed.2 As Galassi relates the story of its making , Gursky , while traveling , had set aside his view camera for a more portable medium-format camera ( producing a negative of 2 1/4 by 2 3/4 inches ) that would still accommodate his interest in detail . He snapped the view at the request of his companions . Enlarging the image six months later , he discovered a dozen minuscule figures trekking along the slope of the pitched and craggy scene , the scattered figures enlivening the view and adding depth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Klausenpass represents an incidental photographic moment that seems pivotal in Gursky 's development : Olympian in its detached observation of the setting and the stilled activity found in its details , this strangely populated landscape presages the preoccupations of a number of the photographs to come .

Photograph Photograph Klitschko , 1999 , 6 3/4 by 8 1/2 feet . // Konig referred to Gursky 's casually populated landscapes as " Sunday pictures , " for their focus on ordinary people at leisure.4 The holiday frolic of Ratingen Swimming Pool ( 1987 ) offers a similarly compelling but livelier scene with bright bathing figures scattered on adjacent fields of blue ( the pool ) and green ( the park lawns ) . The random distribution of figures in an active ground is also seen in Autobahn , Mettmann ( 1993 ) , a bucolic landscape viewed from afar and interrupted by a row of bars , like Venetian blinds cutting across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the highway , further distance the viewer from cattle grazing in a field below.5 In the clockwork movements of a moment in a soccer game , EM , Arena , Amsterdam 1 ( 2000 ) , players scuttle in any direction but where one of them has fallen . Their activity on the playing field recalls the distribution of figures in Klausenpass , reiterating the compositional value of circumstance as an open door to intuition and chance discovery in Gursky 's search for the persuasive image . In 1990 , Gursky was attracted to a visual phenomenon roughly equivalent in its importance to his experience of the sparsely populated alpine landscape . Preparing for an exhibition in Tokyo , he was struck by a newspaper photograph of the Tokyo stock exchange that led him to his own version of a dense crowd scene . Galassi describes it as another turning point , which led to the identification of potential subjects through their appearance in the media.6 Here Gursky retained the viewpoint ( high above ) and scale ( tiny figures ) of his landscape works but opted for a greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , the image teems with anonymous figures in black suits and white shirts , scattered over the floor 's outsized checkerboard parquet . An occasional blur of motion marks the animated crowd . Hands are raised to signal or grasp papers . A pattern picked out in white emerges from a wealth of elements clustered in and around the central oval lozenge of a counter . There are white shirts , scattered papers , white tabletops . In addition , the detail of the image provides an inventory of notebooks , clipboards , masses of papers , even a pair of binoculars resting on a table in the foreground . A variant of the Gursky crowd scene , Klitschko ( 1999 ) depicts the scene of a prizefight in Germany . The wildly complex image was shot at the Kolnarena immediately following a match involving one of the celebrated boxing brothers , Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko . From Gursky 's viewpoint in the upper reaches of the cavernous hall , three centers of interest create a semblance of cubistic space-boxes within boxes . One is the ring itself , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a suspended scoreboard cube with arena-scale television screens , which is more or less at a level with Gursky 's camera and seen corner-on , so that two of its faces are visible . The image on the right screen shows a detail of the activity taking place in the crowded space of the boxing ring directly below the cube . The screen on the left reproduces events in the broadcast booth . Both are digitally inserted . The announcers in the booth , focused on the monitors , appear to be reviewing the fight . There are people with cameras in the ring itself surrounding the victor , smiling fans , the referee . The defeated boxer speaks to an announcer in the ring 's far corner . Around this central activity are clusters of standing fans , aisles , balconies and battalions of empty chairs , as well as multitudes of lights and cables . Sight lines from all around converge on the ring . Both fighters seem subsumed in the detail of this universe , like minute figures strayed out of Brueghel 's world . Without direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's process , there is no way of knowing what digital process has attended the creation of Klitschko . To the viewer , what remains is the enduring impression of an overwhelmingly dense image rendered with astonishing visual clarity . If the individual elements taken together make up the collective identity of the stock exchange or boxing arena , the more pointillist effect of such concert scenes as May Day IV ( 2000 ) capture the tribal , collective spirit of the rave . There , figures fill the image from frame to frame , all individual identity lost to the intensity of the event . By contrast , Gursky 's hermetic , almost lifeless multilevel hotel atriums astonish , draw in and then repel the viewer with the manipulated clarity of their resolution . In works such as Atlanta ( 1996 ) , Times Square ( 1997 ) and Shanghai ( 2000 ) , the broad , apparently seamless perspective of the atrium is the result of the digital marriage of two separate views , which permits the photograph to contain more information than would otherwise be possible and allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs of the Shanghai balconies are uniformly installed with a grid of framed art works . On a level lower than the camera , a woman in a wheelchair accompanied by a dog looks down at her lap , and another figure on the far side gazes into this brightly illuminated pit like Dante on a tour of the circles of hell . What appears to be a camera tripod occupies a section of a balcony at the level of Gursky 's lens , its presence suggesting a possible role in the creation of the image . Photograph Tote Hosen 2000 , 6 3/4 by 16 5/8 feet . Photograph // Before and since Antonioni 's existential darkroom sleuthing in Blow-Up , photographers have considered the esthetic interest of the breakup of a photographic image into grain and the question of what constitutes desirable detail . Changes of technique , taste and editorial direction have all had their impact on such matters as well . Today , the films used in the chromogenic process ( the making of a color print from a color transparency or negative ) are less subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The relatively large format of the view camera increases image clarity . A rapid shutter speed may mitigate the tendency to blur , though it increases the risk of loss of detail . Advances made available with pigment-based inks , which were developed for durability in outdoor advertising , now promise for large-scale photos the longer life associated with oil paintings . These inks expand the life of a color print from an upper range of 60 years to more than 200 years , enhancing the work 's collectibility . While resolution is only part of Gursky 's interest , technological improvements could translate into greater control and increased scale in a constantly evolving medium.8 Much has been made of art-historical affinities and influences perceived in or imposed on Gursky 's work see A. i.A. , July ' ' 98 . In his catalogue essay , Galassi observes connections to the concerns of Jeff Wall , whom Gursky much admires , as well as those of Donald Judd , Caspar David Friedrich , Barnett Newman and Gerhard Richter , among others . And then he cites Gursky 's 1998 correspondence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallels to such precedents but considers the whole discussion calculated and boring . He concludes , perhaps disingenuously : " As I have already said in interviews , the history of art seems to possess a generally valid formal vocabulary which we use again and again . It would perhaps be interesting for you art historians to find out why an artist who is not versed in your subject such as myself still has access to this formal vocabulary . " 9 The exhibition-elegantly conceived , formally resonant and multiply referential-has a residual effect . After looking at the work of Andreas Gursky , the world around seems similarly and instantly composed , important and briefly alive with visual connections informed by the discovery of patterning and distribution of previously unremarked pictorial elements . It 's a way of seeing things not as they are , but as they appear to be . Photograph Atlanta , 1996 , 6 1/8 by 8 3/8 feet . Photograph Tokyo Stock Exchange , 1990 , 6 1/8 by 7 1/2 feet .

The audience derives from an entirely separate negative . While it 's not clear how many or what sorts of audiences Gursky observed and photographed in his research , in the fall of 2000 in New York he was granted permission to photograph the General Assembly of the United Nations , a Knicks game at Madison Square Garden and an audience at Radio City Music Hall . In the end , the negative employed is from a photograph he took in a concert hall in Dusseldorf . Author 's interview with Peter Galassi , April 2001. 2 .

They 're keepers of the flame for teams alive only in sports history books and their own memories . <p> The Brooklyn Dodgers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating the New York Yankees in seven games . <p> The New York Giants , Washington Senators , Boston Braves , St. Louis Browns -- thousands of diamond enthusiasts still hold allegiance to these bygone teams . They organize fan clubs , celebrate great moments at meetings , and swap items on eBay every day all in the name of honoring the past of America 's pastime . And their own youths . <p> Ron Gabriel grew up two miles from Ebbets Field , home of the Brooklyn Dodgers , at a time when you could hear radio announcer " Red " Barber 's play-by-play " from every open window in Brooklyn , " he recalls . These days Gabriel lives in Chevy Chase , Maryland , but Brooklyn never quite left the boy . On October 4 , 1975 , at 3:44 p.m. , he formed the Brooklyn Dodgers Fan Club . It was 20 years to the minute of the team 's first and only World Series victory . <p> " I realized this intensity needed someone to bring Dodgers fans all together , to kind of act as a clearinghouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Gabriel hosted annual meetings at his home ( serving hot dogs and Schaefer Beer , a longtime Dodgers ' sponsor ) . When the 50th anniversary of the team 's World Series victory rolled around in 2005 , he organized a commemorative dinner and passed out bumper stickers : We Loved the Brooklyn Dodgers -- and we STILL DO ! ! <p> But for Gabriel and thousands of fans of Dem Bums , the world changed when the team moved to Los Angeles beginning with the 1958 season . " I went into a state of shock , and I still am , still cant believe it . " Diehards were devastated and many , like Gabriel , never transferred their allegiance to another team . " Once a Brooklyn fail , always a Brooklyn fan , " he says . <p> There is a common thread that binds fans of defunct teams , a certain poetry in their recollections that are valentines to the boys of summers past . You can hear it in the way they share stories -- always in the present tense . Bobby Thompson hits the " shot heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over-the-shoulder catch . With each retelling , there are new insights , a deeper understanding . The drama of the game continues to unfold . Instant replays , never distant replays . <p> " We 're in the Twilight Zone , " says Bill Kent , founder of the New York Baseball Giants Nostalgia Society . " To us , the old Giants are still alive . We relive their exploits . " <p> Bobby Thompson 's walk-off home run , better known as the ' shot heard ' round the world , ' nabbed the National League pennant for the New York Giants against the Brooklyn Dodgers on October 3 , 1951 . <p> Kent grew up in the Bronx , a trolley and subway ride away from the old Polo Grounds in upper Manhattan . As a youngster , Kent would sometimes sneak into the ballpark by climbing over the fence before crews arrived and stake out empty seats with his friends . Other times , he 'd get picked to turn the turnstiles at the entrance gate , earning spare change and free admission to the game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always more kids than jobs . " <p> Ebbets Field was the beloved home of the Brooklyn Dodgers . Elements of the New York Mets ' new Citi Field stadium take inspiration from Brooklyn 's old , storied ballpark . <p> From 1939-1953 , Walter Lanier " Red " Barber ruled the airwaves as the legendary play-by-play announcer of the Brooklyn Dodgers . <p> The Giants society is a loosely knit group of baseball fans , lawyers , teachers , sports writers , and even " a lady umpire and a lady baseball player " among them , who participate in an online discussion group and get together three times a year for what Kent calls schmoozing . Three or four people showed up at the first meeting held at a Chinese restaurant . Word spread , and Kent had to find larger quarters at an Italian restaurant . These days , meetings attract upwards of 50 and are often held in a church basement . Ten dollars pays for the pizza . There are even a couple of Dodgers fans and a sprinkling of Mets fans . " We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're not nice , they 're out , " he says . <p> The 1950s was a turbulent decade for baseball fans . In 1953 , the St. Louis Browns played their last game at Sportsman 's Park before moving to Baltimore . Brownies pitcher Ned Garver , who won 20 games for the 1951 team that ended with a 52-102 record , once famously said : " Our fans never booed us . They would n't dare . We outnumbered ' era . " At least their legacy is alive and well . The St. Louis Browns Historical Society and Fan Club is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year . <p> In 1954 , the Philadelphia Athletics moved to Kansas City ; in 1957 the Boston Braves moved to Milwaukee . And , of course , there was the twin sting for New Yorkers in 1958 when both the Dodgers and Giants made their way to California . <p> When the Philadelphia Athletics moved to Kansas City starting with the 1955 season , it was n't a surprise . But that did n't make it any easier for fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was clear the A 's were running out of money , " he says . The city could n't support both the A 's and the Philadelphia Phillies . Still , Jordan says when the mayor announced a " Save the A 's " committee , " I was one of few people who took him seriously . " <p> Jordan is chairman of the board of the Philadelphia Athletics Historical Society in Hatboro , Pennsylvania , a robust organization of 800 members spread coast to coast . The society puts out a bimonthly newsletter , runs a museum , and holds functions to which original players are invited . There are a few younger members , but Jordan says that for the most part , its ranks are filled with people who were Shibe Park regulars in the days of Lefty Grove , Jimmie Foxx , Eddie Collins , and Mickey Cochrane . One of Jordan 's favorite ballpark memories was the 24-inning game against the Detroit Tigers on July 21 , 1945 , called due to darkness . " I kept score for 22 innings until 1 ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Philadelphia A 's Society Museum and Library . <p> When the team moved on to Kansas City , Jordan stayed a fan . " In 1955 and 1956 I went to Yankee Stadium when Kansas City was in town , but it was n't the same . They changed the numbers of quite a few players , and eventually I had to face the fact that the Phillies were what we had left . " <p> Middle-aged fans are now golden agers and elder statesmen . " That 's something we at the society think about , " Jordan says . " Until recently , we always had a big breakfast in the fall , selling out with hundreds of fans showing up . " But , he says , as volunteers get older , functions are being scaled back . There are also fewer players alive who wore the uniform . <p> The repercussions are showing up in the sports memorabilia market . Mike Heffner , president of Lelands.com , the oldest and one of the largest sports memorabilia auction houses , says the 1980s and ' 90s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the past few years , we 've noticed a slowdown . People who were following teams in the 1940s and ' 50s are mostly retired , some have passed away , and their collections have been sold . " <p> Some team items are valuable not because of the passion of their fans but because of their scarcity . The Seattle Pilots , for instance , played one year in 1969 before becoming the Milwaukee Brewers . " They did n't have a huge fan base . There are n't a tremendous amount of them out there . But a uniform patch or a team-signed ball is very rare , so it 's tremendously collectible , " Heffner says . The Colt .45s ( 1962-1964 ) , a squad that became the Astros , " were a terrible team , but they had really neat uniforms with a pistol on the front , so they 're highly collectible . " The latest franchise to join the brotherhood of bygone teams is the Montreal Expos , now the Washington Nationals . But do n't look for big returns there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Heffner says . <p> Of course , for fans it 's not about money and not even about memorabilia . Their teams may not be in the box scores , and the ballparks may long be gone , but the boys of summer never grow old . <p> In one of baseball 's most memorable moments , New York Giants " center fielder Willie Mays makes an astonishing over-the-shoulder catch at the Polo Grounds in Game One of the 1954 World Series . <p> New York Giants Logo CIRCA 1951 <p> Bill Kent continues to gather new insights on his favorite team as founder of the New York Baseball Giants Nostalgia Society . <p> The short-lived Colt .45s ( 1962-1964 ) baseball team went on to become the Houston Astros . Their logo , which incorporated a pistol , remains highly collectible among baseball fans . <p> By Iyna Bort Caruso <p> <p> BREAKING BARRIERS When Jackie Robinson inked a contract with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1945 , his signing not only broke the color barrier , but it sparked , an exodus of players from the Negro Baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Don Newcombe , and Larry Doby were part of the early talent drain , and by 1960 , the last remaining organized league , the Negro American League , disbanded .
