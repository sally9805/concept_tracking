It 's bad enough I 'm an old maid- but it need n't be with an unscathed hymen as well ! ( NIJINSKY ENTERS OBVIOUSLY AFTER PRACTICING . HE IS FOLLOWED BY VASSILY HOLDING A TOWEL AND WATERING CAN .

ANNA He 's stopped practicing and Vassily is wiping his armpits . ROMOLA DE PULSKY I must be mad- I want to kiss him there . Yes . And in that cleft under his lower lip where perhaps no one has ever kissed him before . ( SHE BLOWS OUT A PLUME OF SMOKE AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Go ! Very bad ! ROMOLA DE PULSKY What did he say ?

VASSILY TURNS TO LEAVE AND ROMOLA SAYS VERY LOUDLY ) Vassily 's such a little old lady with his little towel and watering can . He probably accompanies Vaslav to the loo and wipes his bottom . ANNA Hush ! ROMOLA DE PULSKY They do n't understand Hungarian . ANNA Well do n't say their names . They understand that ! ROMOLA DE PULSKY ( WALKING BY NIJINSKY WHO STILL DOES N'T GLACE HER WAY ) How rude . He has n't given me a glance . I ca n't stand it . You 'd think he never saw me before .

END OF SCENE 1 p. 8 p. 9 Act 1 , Scene 2 Act 1 , SCENE 2 Nijinsky is sitting on the massage table as the masseur gathers up his things . The masseur has a an interesting " tic . " When the masseur 's back is turned , Nijinsky studies his movements and tries to reproduce them . There is a knock on the door . BARON DE GUNSBOURG Vasla , Vaslav , may I come in ? It is I , Dimitri . VASLAV NIJINSKY What 's the matter ? BARON DE GUNSBOURG I ca n't bear to be alone . VASLAV NIJINSKY It 's only an hour to dinner . BARON DE GUNSBOURG I know , I know . ( The masseur opens the door and the Baron enters . The masseur gives a slight bow and a dance step and leaves . The Baron notices Nijinsky doing the imitation ) BARON DE GUNSBOURG What is it ? What 's wrong ? Vaslav , are you having a fit ? Oh , I see you 're doing one of your studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but why would you want to ? You should do me ? Oh no , that would be too pathetic . But tell me , how do I look ? I tried this sash for a bit of color and dash , as we are going to South America . Ole . Oh , I can just imagine what your dear Sergei would say , " Dimitri , you look like an aging whore . " Odd , I do n't miss him , but I 'm always quoting him . How indelicate . Personally , I think this separation from Sergei will do you wonders , not that I do n't understand your relationship . I had one myself , very romantic , rose petals on the bed , that sort of thing . But , I knew it was doomed . He would always arrive from Kiev with this very small valise . I 'd take one look at that very small valise and think , " He 's already planning to leave . " I felt deserted as soon as he arrived . p. 10 VASLAV NIJINSKY Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GUNSBOURG Yes , of course . Passion is nothing but an inferno . Except for dance , of course . VASLAV NIJINSKY Of course . BARON DE GUNSBOURG Ah , dance . You are so brilliant ! VASLAV NIJINSKY You are so transparent . What is it you want , Dimitri ? BARON DE GUNSBOURG I think it 's time you rethought your relationship with Diagheliff . I know how deathly tired you are of all his intrigue . Sergei runs the Ballets Russes like a Caliph 's court , full of favorites and concubines . VASLAV NIJINSKY Yes . BARON DE GUNSBOURG . . Yes well . . . I have a thought-You and I should start a small company . We could achieve some interesting results , do n't you think ? No . No . No . Do n't answer me now . Think about it . In the meantime , let 's play . I have it in mind to introduce you to someone who is quite rich and quite mad for you . VASLAV NIJINSKY I 'm not interested . Thank you , Baron . BARON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is love . If you 're interested in girls , there 's a beautiful girl on board I think you should meet . She 's taken every opportunity to drape herself in front of you . You must have noticed . p. 11 VASLAV NIJINSKY The blue-eyed girl ? BARON DE GUNSBOURG Yes , yes . That 's her . VASLAV NIJINSKY Is she a dancer ? BARON DE GUNSBOURG In the corps de Ballet , I believe . VASLAV NIJINSKY But the Corps de Ballet is in second class and this girl has a cabin near mine . BARON DE GUNSBOURG Oh , she 's very rich . Her mother is a great classical actress , the premier actress of Hungary , actually . Some say she is as great as Bernhardt . ( EMILIA IS CARRIED OUT ON A LITTER WITH A FAN . SHE GRACIOUSLY NODS AND WAVES TO THE AUDIENCE ) BARON DE GUNSBOURG ( Whispering . ) She was the seventh child of a button manufacturer . ( EMILIA IS OFFENDED AND HITS ONE OF HER CARRIERS ON THE HEAD , URGING THEM TO EXIT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DE GUNSBOURG No , her mother . But she became a great actress and married de Pulsky , an aristocrat , which in turn made her very wealthy , which in turn made Romola , that is the blue-eyed girl , a beneficiary of the money . What I am trying to say is , she has money and she paid for her own cabin and you should meet her . p. 12 VASLAV NIJINSKY Does she dance well ? BARON DE GUNSBOURG I ca n't say . I 've never seen her dance . She 's only just joined the company for this tour . VASLAV NIJINSKY I could never be interested in any girl who was n't a beautiful dancer . BARON DE GUNSBOURG Oh for heaven 's sakes- why limit yourself to prima ballerinas ? : You should meet this girl . She 's quite pretty and has eyes like sapphires . Perhaps she is a good dancer . Who knows ? I will introduce you . VASLAV NIJINSKY No need . BARON DE GUNSBOURG But why ? VASLAV NIJINSKY We 've already met . BARON DE GUNSBOURG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sooo. . . you hate her . VASLAV NIJINSKY Oh no . BARON DE GUNSBOURG But you never greet her and she never greets you . . . VASLAV NIJINSKY I make a display of not noticing her BARON DE GUNSBOURG For God 's sakes why ? She 's from a very good family . p. 13 VASLAV NIJINSKY I enjoy provoking her to flirt . It 's always a pleasure to watch someone do what they do best . I 'm perfectly happy with that , Baron . I want to observe love like a beautiful painting of a landscape . It 's enchanting and I don ' have to inhabit it ! BARON DE GUNSBOURG Pity . VASLAV NIJINSKY You seem awfully determined that we should meet . And why is that , Dimitri ? Do you want me to fall in love and run away with her ? Away from Sergei Pavlovitch ? Straight into your . . new company ? BARON DE GUNSBOURG No , I would never presume . . . VASLAV NIJINSKY I am the Ballets Russes . I would never desert her . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NIJINSKY What do you mean ? Why do you say that ? BARON DE GUNSBOURG Sergei does n't really appreciate your choreography the way he should . I adored Sacre and Jeux- although I admit not many others did . And he was n't very fond of L'Apres Midi . VASLAV NIJINSKY Why ? What have you heard ? BARON DE GUNSBOURG Actually I heard that he refuses to give Faune in Paris . He said : " It 's not a ballet . I 'd sooner dismiss the company before I give it again ! " . . I warn you , next he 'll be talking about bringing Fokine back to choreograph . But then again- perhaps it 's all gossip . You know what a shallow muckracker I am. p. 14 VASLAV NIJINSKY So shallow , but so clever ; Well ! I leave you to your motives and ask you to take me on deck and show me how to smoke a pipe like a proper Englishman . BARON DE GUNSBOURG A pipe ? What makes you think I know . . . ? Oh . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with that lovely gentleman . He 's quite impressive and he knows everything about Hindu ruins . He 's been hunting with a minor maharajah . He 's wild about animals , so sensitive . He told me he would give his soul if , just once , he could watch an elephant drink . He 's offered to take me on safari through the jungles of the Amazon - but I ca n't possibly go . Suppose the relationship is brief ? Safari clothes are so costly and it would be perfect waste of money to have them made if the relationship were brief . I mean , where else could I use them ? Certainly not with my wife . END OF SCENE 2 p. 15 Act 1 , Scene 3 Act 1 , Scene 3 Romola and Anna are sitting on deck chairs . Romola is daydreaming with a book in her lap and Anna is carefully putting on lotion . The Man With The Pipe walks by . He greets both ladies but he is eyeing Anna . THE MAN WITH THE PIPE Good day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , too , Monsieur . ( Their eyes linger . ) THE MAN WITH THE PIPE This equatorial sun is terribly hot , do n't you think ? ANNA Have we crossed the equator , then ? THE MAN WITH THE PIPE No . Tonight . Is this your first time ? ANNA First time . . . ? THE MAN WITH THE PIPE Crossing . ANNA Oh , yes , and yours ? THE MAN WITH THE PIPE My third . ANNA Oh . THE MAN WITH THE PIPE Yes , they 'll give you little silk flags of all the nations that touch the equator . ( THE BARON AND NIJINSKY ARE PROMENADING ON THE DECK . THEY WALK BY AND THE BARON GIVES THE MAN WITH THE PIPE A FLIRTATOUS LOOK . THE MAN WITH THE PIPE- TURNS HIS BACK COLDLY AND OBVIOUSLY ) . . Yes . . . well , ladies , enjoy your morning . ( He continues to walk. ) p. 16 ROMOLA DE PULSKY Was that him ? ANNA Who ? ROMOLA DE PULSKY Please . I saw that look pass between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too familiar . ANNA Yes , I 'll go tell him at once . ( She gets up . ) ROMOLA DE PULSKY I ca n't believe you 're going to follow him ? ANNA I have no time to lose . ROMOLA DE PULSKY But what do you know about him ? ANNA He 's shown interest in me . He 's English and he smokes a pipe . I 'll tell you more about him when I get back . Ta ! ROMOLA DE PULSKY Go ! Leave me alone then , you hussy ! ( Anna exits in the direction of the man . Romola takes up a book . Two women walk by in deep discussion . ) WOMAN 2 Pickles and vodka ? WOMAN 1 But he has an estate . WOMAN 2 I suppose you ca n't resist . WOMAN 1 I do n't know . The village is backward , the peasants are drunk , and the roads are impassable . ( The women sit . Romola is restless . The Baron and Nijinsky enter and Romola ostentatiously raises her book to read . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the pipe. ) p. 17 BARON DE GUNSBOURG Yes , yes that is him ! I swear it is him down to the annoying way he holds his pipe . He is pretentious , is n't he ? I do n't know why the English are so determined to be thought eccentric . I mean , did he think it was attractive ? All those bizarre stories about mysterious fires and prominent social figures beaten to death with polo mallets ? I refuse to take him seriously . VASLAV NIJINSKY He seemed to like you well enough . BARON DE GUNSBOURG Please ! And when he said , " Dimitri , if you ever want to commit suicide , do it in my arms . . . " Oh , look , there 's that lovely girl . Shall we say hello ? ( He does n't wait for a response and heads over to Romola who feigns distraction . Nijinsky goes to the ship 's rail . He is followed by two of the prostitutes . ) BARON DE GUNSBOURG What are you reading , my dear ? ROMOLA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiles . ) ROMOLA DE PULSKY Anna Karenina . ( The Baron takes it and shows it to Nijinsky . ) BARON DE GUNSBOURG Look , she is reading a Russian novel , Anna Karenina , by Tolstoy . p. 18 VASLAV NIJINSKY ( Takes it rather brusquely and looks at it and gives it back . ) ( To Baron ) In French ! ( To Romola ) You love Tolstoy ? ROMOLA DE PULSKY Monsieur said something about Tolstoy ? ( Nijinsky and Romola exchange smiles . ) BARON DE GUNSBOURG He asked what you thought of the book . ROMOLA DE PULSKY Actually , I 'm very annoyed with Tolstoy  --  He made Anna Karenina into such a ninny . VASLAV NIJINSKY ( To Baron ) She does n't like Tolstoy . ( To Romola ) Tolstoy , my hero ! BARON DE GUNSBOURG I 'm sure you misunderstood . . . Nijinsky walks away and is joined by one of the dancers . They look out to sea . ( To Romola ) He speaks so little French . . . Now where did he go ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dimitri . He obviously is more interested in the ocean . BARON DE GUNSBOURG Oh , you know how he is. . . the artist . p. 19 ROMOLA DE PULSKY No , Baron , really do n't bother . BARON DE GUNSBOURG Why ? Are you afraid of him ? He may be Le Dieu de la Dance on-stage , but off stage he 's a charming young man . ROMOLA DE PULSKY I 'm not afraid of him . BARON DE GUNSBOURG Good . Then let me present him to you . ROMOLA DE PULSKY I do n't care to , Baron . Thank you . BARON DE GUNSBOURG Do n't be silly . You admire him . ROMOLA DE PULSKY Do I ? BARON DE GUNSBOURG Please ! He 's captivating . We all admire him . He wo n't harm you . I promise and we are great pals . ROMOLA DE PULSKY No . I 'm just sick of it . I 've been presented to him over and over again and he never remembers me . BARON DE GUNSBOURG Vaslav Fomitch . ( Nijinsky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nijinsky , permettez-moi de vous presenter Mlle. De Pulsky . Her mother is the greatest classical actress in Hungary . ( Romola extends her hand and Nijinsky takes it. ) p. 20 BARON DE GUNSBOURG Mlle. De Pulsky is a very talented dancer in our Corps de Ballet . VASLAV NIJINSKY Yes . ROMOLA DE PULSKY Yes . . . Yes . . . Well . Monsieur Nijinsky , I must thank you . VASLAV NIJINSKY Thank me ? ROMOLA DE PULSKY Oh , yes , for Printemps , for Sacre . VASLAV NIJINSKY You are welcome . ROMOLA DE PULSKY You 've made dance the highest art . No matter what they say - never lose your nerve ! Do you understand me ? ( The Baron begins to translate but Nijinsky stops him . ) All great art begins as blasphemy ! VASLAV NIJINSKY Very interesting girl . She has many opinions . BARON DE GUNSBOURG Very astute and so well read . . . quite comfortable income . ROMOLA DE PULSKY ( Looking straight at Nijinsky ) So , gentlemen , do I meet with your approval this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BARON DE GUNSBOURG Sorry . These language difficulties , you know . . . p. 21 VASLAV NIJINSKY I want to see her arch . BARON DE GUNSBOURG I can hardly ask her that ! VASLAV NIJINSKY ( To Romola ) Please , mademoiselle - your foot . BARON DE GUNSBOURG He wants to examine your arch . ROMOLA DE PULSKY Well . . . . All right ( Romola extends her foot for Nijinsky to take off her shoe . He does and examines her foot for flexibility . It is rather painful ) BARON DE GUNSBOURG You know , I must tell you . We 've decided to have a costume ball this evening to celebrate crossing the equator . I hope you 'll come . Perhaps I shall be an odalisque and , Romola Carlovna , I have a brilliant idea for you . You are so slim . You almost look like a boy , and if you hide your hair , I will loan you a pair of my green silk pajamas . ROMOLA DE PULSKY and what will you wear , Monsieur Nijinsky ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND BOW AND EXITS ) BARON DE GUNSBOURG I hate artists ! ( Laughs uneasily . ) Yes , well , He 's a bit rough around the edges . I shall have to mention that to him . Well then - when you write her - regards to your mother . Brrrrr- she 's a real tiger , is n't she ? ( Anna returns . ) Good day , Anna . ( He exits. ) p. 22 ROMOLA DE PULSKY Anna , guess what ? Le Petit came over and flirted with me and I looked into his eyes . They 're slanted , just like my pet Siamese . His eyes are n't green as I thought on-stage . They 're a soft , soft brown , like velvet . ( Eyes appear in the sky like stars . As the lights darken , some are cat 's eyes , others are human . Some stare , some blink . We see Nijinsky asleep in his cabin . ) END OF SCENE 3 p. 23 Act 1 , Scene 4 Act 1 , Scene 4 The giant eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make out Nijinsky 's figure lying on the bed and another figure in formal attire sitting at the foot of the bed . The figure reaches over and pours some water from a flask at Nijinsky 's bedside . Nijinsky stirs . He is still dressed in his practice clothes and reaches blindly for the water . SERGEI DIAGHELIFF Is this what you 're looking for ? ( Nijinsky is horrified and does n't move . ) SERGEI DIAGHELIFF One really should n't nap in the afternoon . It 's such a heavy sleep and one becomes so disoriented , do n't you think ? ( He hands the glass to Nijinsky who drinks from it . ) But my dear , you know you wanted to see me . I 'm never out of your thoughts and I hate to admit it , but you 're scarcely out of mine . Here . Drink . Drink . VASLAV NIJINSKY You have a new boy anyway . Go away . ( Nijinsky gulps down some water and lights some lights . ) SERGEI DIAGHELIFF I 'm still here . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mon cher , careful , you are beginning to remind me of your crazy brother , Stassik . Pour soul . ( He looks around the cabin . ) Those eyes are making me nervous . You 're not becoming paranoid , are you ? ( Diagheliff snaps his fingers and the eyes disappear. ) p. 24 VASLAV NIJINSKY I know what an eye is . An eye is a theater . SERGEI DIAGHELIFF Shush , Vatsa , shush . VASLAV NIJINSKY I am sick at heart , Sergei . I am tired of intrigue and intrigue . I want to be an unnecessary man . I want to be a monk and build a simple house . I want to go to Siberia and preach to the peasants and work the land . I want to be a tree and its roots . I want to live simply , in isolation . SERGEI DIAGHELIFF You must stop reading that old lunatic , Tolstoy . All this " Philosophy . " You are getting so boring , Vatza . I want you to take some time off , but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must do something astonishing for Paris next year . Tolstoy ! You would go back to the Stone Age at a time when we ca n't afford to be less modern . No ! Futurism , cubism - the soul splintered from the universe - these are the last words . I will not let the position of artistic leadership slip away from me . VASLAV NIJINSKY It 's too late . You 've already become the ultimate lackey a servile follower , you , the visionary , are now terrified of causing the least scandal . SERGEI DIAGHELIFF You only say this because I thought your ballet Jeux was a complete failure . Even your Sacre du Printemps is not a real ballet . . . And L'Apres Midi - an eleven-minute ballet that needs a hundred hours of rehearsal . My God . All our friends of the Ballets Russes agree with me . It would be a mistake to encourage you further as a choreographer. p. 25 VASLAV NIJINSKY Jeux was not entirely successful . But , Sacre was important . SERGEI DIAGHELIFF The public , the paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not understood . SERGEI DIAGHELIFF Vatza , Vatza . A painting or a piece of a music might be misunderstood at first or unappreciated for a long time , maybe a hundred years , but a ballet ? A ballet must be received by the public today or else it is doomed to obscurity . Come , come you know how much I have done for you . I have given you three ballets to choreograph . Jeux and Sacre are not the kind of ballets that can sustain the success of the Ballets Russes . You must understand that I have a great obligation . VASLAV NIJINSKY But not to me . SERGEI DIAGHELIFF Of course to you , darling . In fact I want you to look at some new ballets Fokine is choreographing and give me your opinion . VASLAV NIJINSKY Fokine ? BARON DE GUNSBOURG Yes . That is , if you have time . I must remember to tell that idiot , De Gunsbourg , to keep the little Hungarian flirt away from you . That imbecile . Does he really think he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plotting to have his own company again , but I am hardly worried . That man could n't run a flea circus . p. 26 VASLAV NIJINSKY I do n't think as little of women as you do , Sergei . SERGEI DIAGHELIFF My poor little saint . How you suffer . VASLAV NIJINSKY There is a difference between what I do for others and what I do for myself . ( Two dancers dressed as prostitutes dance out laughing raucously and approach first Nijinsky and then turn to fawn over Daigheliff , who treats them with bored indifference . ) SERGEI DIAGHELIFF Really ? VASLAV NIJINSKY Those long solitary I took in Paris ? I was looking for whores . I wanted beautiful , healthy girls . I fucked whores every day . Once I made love to a woman who had her period . I was covered with it . Then I went to you because I knew it would disgust you . I lied to you . I became you , a fake , a fraud . You dye your hair black so no one will know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I see that disgusting black cream you leave on the pillowcases and the lock of hair you dye white just to be noticed - it has turned yellow . Yellow . You have two false front teeth and when you take them out , you look like a wicked old woman . And that monocle you wear is only for effect . Your eyes are perfect . Deceit is your art . Deceit and sex . SERGEI DIAGHELIFF You did n't seem to mind the sex , as I recall . Actually , as I was telling Prince Lvov when he passed you on to me , I was quite gratified by all the nice tricks . He taught you . He was a very athletic young man , was n't he ? p. 27 VASLAV NIJINSKY He understood love . He wrote love poems . He was beautiful . He thought you would be useful to me . SERGEI DIAGHELIFF Yes . His was a great love . He passed you around like a used penny . And I - who corrupted you , who used you - as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de la danse . Vatza , you are a great artist , a gentle soul . Who else can appreciate you as I do ? VASLAV NIJINSKY You appreciate me like a painting in a museum . Museums are graveyards ! They are tidy . They are dead . Beauty for me is n't tidy . It 's not pretty . Beauty is feeling in a face . Beauty is a hunchback . I like ugly people . I am an ugly man with feeling . I dance hunchbacks and straight-backs . I am the artist who loves all shapes and all kinds of beauty . SERGEI DIAGHELIFF Then you must love me , too . VASLAV NIJINSKY I have found a girl . She has chestnut hair , her nose is long and straight . It has character . Her eyes are alive . I want to fuck her . SERGEI DIAGHELIFF What are you doing , Vatza ? I am worried to death about you . VASLAV NIJINSKY Of course . You , who thought I was boring and stupid . Who was ashamed I would speak and humiliate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . But I loved the Ballets Russes . I gave my whole heart to the Ballets Russes . I worked like an ox . I lived like a martyr . I killed myself for the dance , but I am tired . Tired . So tired of you showing that Nijinsky is your pupil in everything . I was tired of looking for love when there was nothing . You all thought I wanted praise , but I hate compliments . I only love love . You love fame , you love boys , you love a beautiful body , and you love objets d'art . You are wicked . You are crazy . I carry you with me like a stone , like a cross I ca n't put down . Leave me alone so I can breathe . I am going to the New World . I will have a new life and will do what God asks me. p. 28 SERGEI DIAGHELIFF Good , good . Take a year off . Take some time .

We hear music . A crowd gathers . A tango is begun . Suddenly , we see a figure spotlighted center stage . The figure is dressed in classic tango clothes , only the right half is dressed as a man , the left half is dressed as a woman . We begin with the male half turned toward the audience so that , at first , we believe it is only a man dancing . There is a dramatic turn and then the female side is turned toward the audience . The man/woman does a solo tango in which he first seduce some of the dancers as a man and then the other as a woman . Then the three pair off with the other passengers . They all tango . This dance should last about 2 minutes . As the tango is ending , Nijinsky enters . He is not in costume but in evening clothes looking very elegant . The lights come up and we see a circle of grotesquely costumed party goers . Diagheliff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dressed as a bird of paradise and another as a gargoyle . Nijinsky is very interested in the steps of the tango . The tango ends and a bolero begins . Couples pair off . The Diagheliff head approaches Nijinsky . The head is removed and we see the Baron underneath . BARON DE GUNSBOURG Good evening . Good evening . How handsome you look , but you 're not in costume . Or are you ? Let me guess , you 're disguised as a gentleman . Just joking . Just joking . As you can see , I 've come as a monster our dear Sergei . Speaking of which , I hope you are still thinking over my proposal . You could work independently . We could build a new theater . Did n't you say you wanted a round theater like the Greeks ? p. 30 VASLAV NIJINSKY Like an eye . BARON DE GUNSBOURG Yes . Yes . An eye . An eye . Exactly , the cyclopean eye , all seeing .

( The Baron disappears into the crowd and grabs a partner . Romola enters alone . She is wearing an elegant evening dress and her hair is carefully done . She and Nijinsky nod to each other , but stand silently a little ways apart watching the crowd . Finally , Nijinsky moves closer . ) VASLAV NIJINSKY Good evening , mademoiselle .

He was the only person in the entire company who did n't come to our wedding . VASLAV NIJINSKY Forget about it . It 's nothing . We have an opening tomorrow . An opening is fate . It 's everything . We win the audience . Or not . There are no second chances . What was I thinking ? I should have seen you dance sooner ! ROMOLA DE PULSKY You 're speaking in Russian , Vaslav . VASLAV NIJINSKY The dance needs precision , refinement . The slightest deviation , the smallest undue tension in the rhythm of the movement , any small mistake can destroy the whole composition . The dance becomes a caricature . ROMOLA DE PULSKY Vaslav , I ca n't understand you . p. 69 VASLAV NIJINSKY I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the barre and does some stretches and plies , loosening up .

SERGEI DIAGHELIFF What did you expect ? An artist to share your heart and soul ? My poor Vaslav . Tsk , tsk , tsk . EMILIA MARKUS She 's quite good and quite beautiful .

Think of the Lido , Sergei , where you find all your beautiful little Italian boys stretched out on the beach , powdered with sand as if they are delectable blini covered with sugar . You will forgive me. p. 70 SERGEI DIAGHELIFF Never ! You 'll make babies , not ballets ! VASLAV NIJINSKY ( To Romola . ) Plie and pique arabsesque . Hold . Epaulement ! Epaulement !

Children natural always . Walk . Madame , concentrate ! ROMOLA DE PULSKY ( To Emilia . ) Am I doing badly ? EMILIA MARKUS ( Staring at Diagheliff . ) Who would n't with all this faggotry ! p. 71 SERGEI DIAGHELIFF ( To EMILIA ) Does he really know what it means to cross me ? And to cross me like this ? For a cow ? I could almost cry for his ignorance . ( He turns his back . ) VASLAV NIJINSKY Stop . You work too hard . ROMOLA DE PULSKY You told me to work hard ! VASLAV NIJINSKY Dance not work . You are too tight . You move like cripple . ROMOLA DE PULSKY I 'm about to die from nerves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand because you 're a machine , not a human being ! VASLAV NIJINSKY Dance never tight . ( He does a few steps to demonstrate . He speaks in Russian out of frustration . ) Dance is simple . Like one breath and then another . Every step , every action is separate , but it must seem inevitable . ROMOLA DE PULSKY Please speak French , Vaslav . VASLAV NIJINSKY Ach ! ( He walks away . ) ROMOLA DE PULSKY Mother , what have I done ? EMILIA MARKUS Romuschka , I 'm afraid for you . p. 72 ROMOLA DE PULSKY Do n't say that . Why do you say that ? EMILIA MARKUS Look at him . ROMOLA DE PULSKY He 's an artist that 's all and he 's Russian ! EMILIA MARKUS Romola , his grandmother went mad and starved herself to death - ROMOLA DE PULSKY So ? Papa killed himself and I 'm not insane . EMILIA MARKUS He has a brother who sits drooling in a lunatic asylum . ROMOLA DE PULSKY Stassik fell two stories and damaged his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be his nursemaid the rest of your life . Is this what you aspire to ? ROMOLA DE PULSKY Why ca n't you just be happy for me and not state your cruel intentions as if they were prophecies ? Everything will be splendid mother . I 'd die for him ! EMILIA MARKUS One does n't have to die for love , for love to be real . ROMOLA DE PULSKY Papa did . . . EMILIA MARKUS Enough ! Enough ! Your father did n't die for love . He died for greed . He embezzled money . It was a great scandal . p. 73 ROMOLA DE PULSKY You lie . You 're lying . EMILIA MARKUS And you can stop blaming me for your father 's death . It was n't I who placed a gun in his hand and made him blow his brains out . It was his so-called friends in Budapest who gave him the revolver and suggested that he end his life honorably . ROMOLA DE PULSKY Why are you saying this ? EMILIA MARKUS To save you . . Please . Leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an abortion . ( Emilia exits . ROMOLA goes to Nijinsky ) ROMOLA DE PULSKY What shall I do ? VASLAV NIJINSKY ( Not looking at her . ) Dance . Dance . You may weep , but you must work . Even for the very back row of the Corps de Ballet . Dance . An artist must have one goal , one goal only - to perfect himself , to attain new heights in his art . Always , always . ( He turns , hoping to be embraced by Diagheliff , who stands back . ) What have I done ? What have I done ? She is not a dancer . I 've thrown my life away ! SERGEI DIAGHELIFF Good ! Suffer ! Die ! I look at you and glass explodes in my heart . You want to puncture my heart and kill me ? I ca n't endure this . I wo n't work with you . I ca n't work with you . I do n't need you .

I 've just discovered the world 's greatest work of fiction - our contract with the theater ! Nothing is true . Nothing ! They promised us twenty musicians and we have five who speak God only knows what language . Yes , there are bathrooms , but none of them work and three dancers have diarrhea . I 'm beginning to detest producing . It 's debasing . Where is Romola and how are you , my dear ? ANNA ( A little testy . ) I 'm fine , Baron . Romola should be here any minute . ( the captain walks by rapidly with a suitcase that is far too heavy for him . The man with the pipe comes by arm in arm with an older , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confer together nearby . Both Dimitri and Anna stare at them . The man with a pipe and the woman then stroll by . Neither gives Anna or Dimitri a glance . ) ANNA I hate the English . BARON DE GUNSBOURG Yes . Despicable .

BARON DE GUNSBOURG Gracious , you sound like a condemned prisoners . . . ANNA I 've left your bags . Do you need me for anything else ? ROMOLA DE PULSKY No . Thank you Anna . . . . we might as well go in now . BARON DE GUNSBOURG Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put out the cigarette but Anna takes it . ) ANNA Here , I 'll take it .

Vassily advises Nijinsky who then enters from the bedroom . ) BARON DE GUNSBOURG Vaslav , so good to see you . What a lovely suite . Oh , and a view from the harbor . My , my , does n't that street down there remind you of that little section of Paris with all the strange shops . You know the one - where you can buy a new cranial saw or a wax model of a human nose complete with hair . ( Nijinsky is n't responding . ) You did know I was coming ? p. 77 VASLAV NIJINSKY ( To Romola ) Why the Baron ? ROMOLA DE PULSKY Yes , well . . . there are some private things to say , but obviously , we must understand everything between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BARON DE GUNSBOURG Yes , you see , she said that this is rather embarrassing , but . . . VASLAV NIJINSKY Please , Dimitri . Do n't insult me . I can look at her face and understand . BARON DE GUNSBOURG He says to continue . ROMOLA DE PULSKY I 'm nervous . VASLAV NIJINSKY Tell her , she must talk without stopping . I am very nervous . BARON DE GUNSBOURG Vaslav asks that you speak freely . ROMOLA DE PULSKY I can guess what he said . It 's not so easy to speak as he supposes . ( She faces Nijinsky directly . ) First , what did you think of my dancing ? Will I ever dance like Pavolova , like Karsavina ? VASLAV NIJINSKY No , never . BARON DE GUNSBOURG Why not ? She 's very lithe and graceful . VASLAV NIJINSKY You begin too late . p. 78 ROMOLA DE PULSKY I understand . VASLAV NIJINSKY But , I compose special little dances for you dance beautifully . ROMOLA DE PULSKY Do n't bother . I will never dance in public again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell her an artist can never . . . ROMOLA DE PULSKY An artist what ? I 'm not an artist . God , I 'm so sick of hearing this ! BARON DE GUNSBOURG You have to go slower . He 'll never understand you and he all but forbids me to translate ! This is a disaster . VASLAV NIJINSKY How can I love you if you are not an artist ? An artist can traverse a whole world - by pacing from one wall of a room to the other . You see only four walls . A prison . I ca n't live like that ! I asked you to learn to dance , because for me , dancing is the highest art . I wanted to teach you , but you became frightened . You did n't trust me . At that moment , I felt death . I had put myself in the hands of someone who could never comprehend me . BARON DE GUNSBOURG Vaslav wants you to dance . VASLAV NIJINSKY Baron , STOP ! ROMOLA DE PULSKY Then it 's settled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annulment ! p. 79 BARON DE GUNSBOURG This is impossible . I can not be put in this situation ! Vaslav , be reasonable . I must translate . These are very delicate matters . How will you understand each other ? ( Nijinsky turns his back . ) BARON DE GUNSBOURG Romola Carlovna , what am I to do ? Please I beg you - both of you - come to some agreement . Surely something can be done . ( Romola is silent . ) BARON DE GUNSBOURG And now what ? What shall I do ? What shall I tell Diagheliff ? Oh yes , Sergei- or had you forgotten ? I just wired him that you are married . He 'll be in shock . He 's most likely writhing on the floor in paroxysms of rage as we speak . Now he must be told something else ? What ? VASLAV NIJINSKY Why do n't we tell him about our intimate little dance company , Baron ? BARON DE GUNSBOURG No , no no . . . That 's impossible . He must not know me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am haunted by stupidity . I scarcely have the character for my own relationships , let alone an entire company of them . I do n't know how Sergei does it . ( He looks from one to the other . He shrugs . ) I suppose I shall have to ask him . . . if he is still speaking to me ! ( He exits. ) p. 80 ROMOLA DE PULSKY Did you understand what I said ? We have n't slept together . The Catholic Church will grant us an annulment . VASLAV NIJINSKY Yes . I know this " annulment . " I will do what God tells me . ( He closes his eyes . ) ROMOLA DE PULSKY Do what your heart tells you . ( He moves toward Romola and cups her cheek with his hand . ) VASLAV NIJINSKY Only God knows our heart . ROMOLA DE PULSKY How can you think that , Vaslav ? People do n't love each other because of the love of God or the fear of God . We love someone because the world does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! What sense ! ( He laughs softly . ) Roma , Romuschka , you are a dangerous girl for me . You have the willfulness of a rich girl . You live entitled , oblivious but you suffer . You love me and I am drawn to you with iron straps . Who knows what it is . You are innocent and wicked and brave . And you 're beautiful . You are more beautiful than you are supposed to be . So beautiful that you should be stupid , but you 're not stupid . I love you . ( He kisses her . She kisses him . He holds her fiercely ) p. 81 ROMOLA DE PULSKY What is it , Vaslav ? VASLAV NIJINSKY You need words . I do n't have them . I am a lullabyer . Rockabye , bye , bye , bye . Rockabye , bye , bye Rockabye bye bye , Rockabye bye bye , .

I used to give my wife roses that cost five francs a piece . I brought her roses every day- twenty , thirty at a time . I loved giving her white roses . Red roses frightened me .
