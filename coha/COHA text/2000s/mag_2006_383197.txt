We often think about the road not taken : an old lover , a friend , a childhood memory . Author Martha McPhee ponders the question , Is it wise to return to your past ? // Not so long ago an old boyfriend called to ask if he could see me . We 'd broken up 12 years before and had not been in touch since . Now he was divorcing , a messy situation that involved two children . He was a handsome man , resembling Jude Law . For two years in our early 20s we 'd been together . We 'd traveled Southeast Asia , lived in Sri Lanka , trekked through Nepal , but I 'd never been able to love him properly because I was in love with someone else . I was curious , though , so I invited him to visit . I put on mascara and a pretty sweater , fluffed up pillows , vacuumed even . I was happily married , had a daughter and a newborn son , but still I wanted to go back as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was eager , nervous , as if I really would be able to travel through time . He spent the afternoon at my apartment in New York City , met my children , looked at pictures on the walls of my husband ( who had excused himself for the day ) , our wedding , our trips , our life . He looked at my furnishings , my books , asked about my career , my marriage . He studied me . The old boyfriend stepped inside my world , peered down the road not taken , and then said before leaving , " Now I know . I could never have married you . " Though I laugh about this story and indulgently turn over the reasons he may have had for his parting comment , I realize this visit was ultimately not about me . Rather , it was about him and his desire to shatter the myth his memory and imagination had created of me . After seeing him , I pondered the notion of returning to the past . Is it a good idea ? Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what I gained from seeing him again . At the time , I was working on a novel , a love story loosely based on the romance-with an Italian-that had eclipsed my ability to love the Jude Law look-alike . I wondered whether my fictional lovers should meet later , years after the end of their affair . What would happen if they did ? What would they be hoping for , trying to redress ? Then I made the question more personal : Would I want to see him again , the man I met one summer when I was 18 on a Greek island ? We were together for six years and loved each other so impossibly , it took us five years to break up . Who would this man be today ? I have tried on a few occasions to return to the past . On a trip to Maine I drove by the house my grandmother had once lived in , a Victorian home on a lonely road , atop a hill . I idled in front of it , sitting in my car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . I had spent my summers here as a child-an enchanted house filled with stories , my grandmother spinning them as she raked pine spills and I played with dolls beneath the evergreens , sea air all around . The house was as beautiful as ever , now painted a pale yellow . But I did not ask the new owners if I could go inside . Instead , I drove on . With my husband and baby daughter , I went back to Italy after vowing I never would , but once there I found myself going only to places I had not been to before . I noted with not a little regret that now I was referred to as signora . I was a signorina no more . Returning there starkly revealed how much time had passed , forcing me to take its measure . To Gladys , a childhood friend , I went back , but only because she came to me . We were in love and inseparable . I met her the year my parents separated . I was 5 . I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother to Head Start , where she taught , and there I met Gladys . She came from a family of 16 . Her mother had severe diabetes , and her home was in more chaos than mine . Through each other we escaped until fifth grade , when our friendship came apart . Twenty years later she called me and without identifying herself said , " The New York Lotto pot is huge . Buy me a ticket and I 'll pay you back . If I win , I 'll split it with you . " I knew exactly who she was , and I thrilled inside . I had her on the phone . I was talking to my past . I was not a 30-year-old writer , struggling to survive . She was not a 30-year-old plumber on the outskirts of Trenton ( doing quite well , by the by ) . Desperately , I wanted to see her . " I 'll buy two , " I said . " If I win , I 'll split mine with you . " We lost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We recounted many stories , remembered old times , and then life carried us away from each other again . The older we get , it seems , the more people and places are going to be left behind on the banks of our pasts , left there because a love went bad , because of a move , a fight , a betrayal , an injustice , a death . A few weeks ago I wrote to a friend with whom I 'd lost touch for reasons I can not recall . I 'd read a short story of hers , and it reminded me of when we were aspiring fiction writers , the hurdles and hoops we would laugh about having to hazard . I wanted to tell her that I admired the story , that I missed her . I never heard back from her . I do not regret having written the letter , but I do feel this experience confirms that it is rare to be able to dart into the past to retrieve it , to fix it . The past is littered with loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our memories , and fossils , though sometimes delicate , are tempting to hold and admire . After September 11 my Italian called to see if I was all right . His voice was the same , strong with a lilt to each perfectly enunciated word . I told him I was fine . Then his voice was sucked away , back through the lines , across the Atlantic to Italy . Soon after that horrific date , I read in the newspaper that many old lovers called each other to be certain that the other had not been killed , wanting to be reassured that the fossil was still intact , to know that resurrection , even if unlikely , could still be a hope . Memory is a dreamscape , and a dreamscape has no expiration date . It is an eternal present . The dream is all that is behind us , and thus we ca n't help wanting to go back . The mistake , it seems , is to dwell there . Change in linear time is the one constant truth about the world . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look-alike and with Gladys I could not be 10 again , going back to my Italian could also squash the memory , kill it even , and then indeed I would feel regret-regret about its loss . Regret of any kind is insidious . It steals from the present . If I leave my Italian floating on the island of my youth , we can always be young and in love and flooded with its possibility . Preserving memory does not steal from the present . Rather , the past , left alone , accumulates to create all that is now . Martha McPhee 's new novel , L'America , is available this month .
