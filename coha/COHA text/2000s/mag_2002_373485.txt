We expect our sitting Presidents to weigh in on trade policy or a plan to fix Medicare . But in a seven-page article in next month 's Runner 's World , cover boy George W. Bush offers the particulars of his fitness routine : 3-mile runs six days a week , plus strengthening and stretching exercises . He says the workouts provide much-needed stress relief and urges Americans to follow his example . The magazine even critiques Bush 's running form ( nice knee lift but chin too high ) . The article continues a storied sporting tradition of athletic counsel from the Oval Office .  --  By Rebecca Winters
