THE CASE AGAINST WAL-MART // H. Lee Scott Jr . looks every inch the chief executive of America ? s biggest and most powerful corporation as he strides through the lobby of the Omni Los Angeles Hotel on his way to make the most important speech of his career . Wearing an expensive , well-tailored suit on his stocky frame , his hair carefully coiffed , and his corporate game face on , Scott shows no sign of his natural fear of public speaking . To the contrary , the fifty-four-year-old executive appears eager for the chance to justify his company , Wal-Mart Stores , to the 500 business and community leaders who await him in the Omni ? s ballroom . // The Omni-a luxury high-rise located in a solidly pro-union , politically liberal city-is an unlikely venue for the chief executive of an Arkansas-based corporation that is famously frugal , deeply conservative , and Southern-fried to the core . Wal-Mart already has 180 stores in California , but its ambitious expansion plans call for it to quadruple this total while moving from the outskirts into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big cities . In many Golden State locales , Wal-Mart was being denied the zoning and other clearances it needed , and so Scott has flown out on this February day in 2005 to make the case for himself and his company in person at a luncheon sponsored by Town Hall Los Angeles , a nonpartisan group that immodestly but not inaccurately bills itself as a forum " for the most important thinkers and leaders on Earth . " ( 1 ) // Scott takes the stage to polite applause and opens with an aw-shucks flourish reminiscent of the late Sam Walton , the disarmingly folksy " Mr. Sam , " who founded Wal-Mart in the remote Ozarks hill town of Bentonville in 1962 . " I know that Town Hall Los Angeles has a national reputation for hosting conversations on the issues that matter-talks that feature prominent figures from the worlds of government , business , the nonprofit sector , and the arts , " Scott says . " It ? s a little humbling for a shopkeeper from Arkansas to follow such folks to Town Hall ? s distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faux humility to offer a ringing defense of the embattled company where he has worked for twenty-six years . By selling vast quantities of goods at its trademark " Every Day Low Prices , " Wal-Mart has single-handedly raised America ? s standard of living , saving consumers about $100 billion a year , he contends . " These savings are a lifeline for millions of middle- and lower-income families who live from payday to payday , " he says . " In effect , it gives them a raise every time they shop with us . " As Scott tells it , Wal-Mart also provides good jobs for hundreds of thousands of equally deserving employees , offers even part-time workers generous health insurance and other benefits , and contributes hefty tax payments to thousands of towns and cities from sea to shining sea . " I believe that if you look at the facts with an open mind , " he says , " you ? ll agree that Wal-Mart is good for America . " ( 3 ) // Scott accuses greedy labor unions , inefficient supermarket chains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to suit their own purposes , undermining not only the company but also the nation . In so many words , the CEO contends that Wal-Mart is America and that to oppose the company ? s advance into California and other growth markets is to oppose progress itself . " When someone builds a better mousetrap , it ? s not the American way to deny average folks the chance to use it to improve their lives , " he says . " The horse and buggy industry wasn ? t permitted to crush the car . The candle lobby wasn ? t allowed to stop electric lights . " To deny Americans " the higher living standards that Wal-Mart ? s business efficiency can bring is to make a mockery of American ideals under the guise of pursuing them . " ( 4 ) // Hold it right there . When America ? s largest corporation conflates its self-interest with life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness , alarm bells should go off in every city hall , statehouse , and union hall in the land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its presumption that selling vast quantities of cut-rate merchandise entitles it to behave as if it represents the best interests of the American people . Scott likes to call Wal-Mart an " agent " of the consumer , but this seems far too mild a description of a company of such size , power , and righteous zeal . Its critics would argue that intimidator , enforcer , coercer , tyrant are more apt . In the name of the shopper , Wal-Mart systematically bullies its workers , its suppliers , and the residents of towns and cities disinclined to submit to the expansion imperative of a company currently opening new stores at the rate of 1.45 a day . // Who among us does not crave a bargain ? But we Americans-including the financially strapped folks Wal-Mart claims as its own-are not defined by how much money we save down at the Supercenter . We are a nation of workers first and shoppers second ; as the saying goes , " You got to work to eat . " We also are a nation of citizens entitled to vote as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial self-interest as defined by Wal-Mart. // Today , Wal-Mart is besieged by critics on all sides , but perhaps the greatest threat it faces is from within-from unhappy , demoralized employees who are quitting at the rate of hundreds of thousands a year and who have dozens of class-action lawsuits pending against the company . On the very day that Scott was extolling Wal-Mart ? s virtues at the Omni , a ragtag group of his low-level employees gathered 850 miles to the east to bite the hand that barely feeds them . Joined by dozens of supporters , they stationed themselves across the street from a Wal-Mart Supercenter in Loveland , Colorado-a fast-growing exurb of Denver-to loudly cheer on a drive to unionize the store ? s tire-and-lube shop . Joshua Noble , the twenty-one-year-old leader of the rebellion against his virulently anti-union employer , is an epileptic who had to move back in with his parents because he could not afford to live on his Wal-Mart paycheck . " Always the low price means always paying your workers less , " Noble declares. ( 5 ) // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average for retail workers in the United States ; although the exact amount is debatable , the highest figure , Wal-Mart ? s own , is a mere $9.68 an hour . And starting wages are several dollars an hour less . Scott-who received $12,593,493 in salary , bonus , stock awards , and other compensation in 2004-defends Wal-Mart ? s pay scale by rounding off the hourly average to $10 and noting that it is almost twice the federal minimum wage of $5.15 . Even so , the typical employee working full-time at Wal-Mart makes just $17,600 a year , well below the $19,157 poverty line for a family of four . // Because Wal-Mart is so big , it has dragged down wages throughout the country . Economists at the University of California at Berkeley found that Wal-Mart ? s expansion during the 1990s cut the income of America ? s retail employees by 1.3 percent-or by $4.7 billion in 2000 alone.6 What is more , the depressing effect of Wal-Mart ? s expansion on payrolls extends well beyond retailing . According to a 2005 analysis by economists at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person fell by 5 percent across the board following Wal-Mart ? s entry into a county . The evidence " strongly suggest(s) that Wal-Mart stores lead to wage declines , shifts to lower-paying jobs ( or less skilled workers ) , or increased use of part-time workers , " the authors concluded , adding that the company ? s impact on local labor markets was particularly pronounced in the South , where its stores are most numerous and where they have been open the longest. ( 7 ) // And the health insurance that Scott touted in his speech ? Only 44 percent of Wal-Mart ? s 1.3 million U.S. workers have signed up for even the least-expensive medical benefits that the company offers. ( 8 ) Many simply can not afford even the minimum $1,000 deductible and the $35 monthly premium for individual and $141 for family coverage . The result ? To make ends meet , many employees see no alternative to going on the dole . An astounding 46 percent of the children of Wal-Mart workers are uninsured or on Medicaid. ( 9 ) " For being such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan , " complains Noble , who pays nearly $200 a month for his health insurance plus another $100 for the prescription medicine that prevents his epileptic seizures. ( 10 ) // Unhappy Wal-Mart workers complain as much about being overworked as underpaid . The company deliberately understaffs its stores to hold down payroll costs on one hand , and yet is absolutely allergic to paying hourly workers overtime on the other , putting its store managers in the position of finding ways to reconcile the irreconcilable or suffer the career consequences . The obvious , though generally illegal , solution is to force employees to work extra hours without pay , either by eliminating meal and rest breaks or by having them punch out and keep working " off the clock . " To a certain unquantifiable extent , Wal-Mart ? s labor cost advantage is the product of playing fast and loose with its own stated policies at its employees ? expense . // In 2000 , Wal-Mart did its own audit of one week ? s time-clock records for 128 stores employing 25,000 hourly workers in total . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 60,767 instances of rest breaks not taken , 15,705 instances of meal breaks forgone , and 1,371 instances of minor-age employees working excessive hours or at inappropriate times ( during school hours , for example ) . Despite this , the company took no corrective action whatsoever , and instead disavowed its own audit after it was leaked to the New York Times in 2004 , claiming that it had no way of knowing whether workers hadn ? t simply forgotten to sign out as they came and went . " Our view , " said a spokesman , " is that the audit really means nothing . " ( 11 ) Others do not agree-federal and state authorities have repeatedly cited and fined Wal-Mart for labor-law violations , including hiring outside contractors who employ illegal aliens . // Wal-Mart insists on describing itself as " pro-associate , not anti-union , " but it is ruthless in trying to suppress any and all attempts by unions to organize its stores . One of the company ? s standard-issue manuals for store-level supervisors is the Managers ? Toolbox to Remaining Union-Free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such telltale signs of incipient unionism as " frequent meetings at associates ? homes " or " associates who are never seen together . . . talking or associating with each other . " By some accounts , Wal-Mart headquarters conducts covert surveillance of employee telephone calls and e-mails . Whenever it does detect pro-union sentiment at a store , the home office dispatches a " labor relations team " by private jet to cajole and intimidate dissident workers into toeing its strict anti-union line . // In a rare instance of defiance , workers in a store in Jonqui ? re , Qu ? bec-North America ? s staunchest bastion of trade unionism-voted in the fall of 2004 to join the union that Wal-Mart considers its archenemy , the United Food and Commercial Workers . In apparent retaliation , Wal-Mart , to the outrage of the people of Qu ? bec , shut down the store , which still had sixteen years to run on its twenty-year lease , and put 190 workers on the street in an area with one of Canada ? s highest unemployment rates . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are turning to the courts . In 2005 , the company faced more than forty class-action suits in thirty states alleging that it forces employees to work extra hours without pay , including a case in Texas brought on behalf of 200,000 workers who claim that Wal-Mart owes them $150 million for forcing them to work through their fifteen-minute breaks over a four-year period . In Massachusetts , lawyers representing 55,000 workers claim to have documented 7,000 different instances of managers deleting large blocks of time from payroll records . Wal-Mart settled one such case in Colorado in 2001 by distributing $50 million in unpaid wages to 69,000 employees . A year later , an Oregon jury delivered a guilty verdict against the company in the first of these so-called wage-and-hour cases to go to trial . // Scores of other lawsuits allege that Wal-Mart routinely violated laws against discrimination in denying women , black , and Hispanic workers raises and promotions . A sex-discrimination case certified in mid-2004 by a federal judge in California is the largest civil rights class-action suit in history by several orders of magnitude . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every woman who has worked at Wal-Mart since late 1998-1.6 million workers all told . // In its attempts to prevent the case from broadening beyond the six original plaintiffs , Wal-Mart claimed that each store was " different " from the others and that at worst there were only a few " bad apples " among its store managers . Its own records tell a different story : Since 1997 , female employees were paid 5 percent to 15 percent less than men working the same jobs in every part of the country , despite having higher performance ratings and more seniority on average . Women comprise two-thirds of all hourly workers but received only one-third of all promotions to management positions . At Wal-Mart , a mere 33 percent of managers are women , compared with 56 percent at the company ? s top twenty competitors , according to a study commissioned by the plaintiffs . The depositions of hundreds of female employees filed in support of the case are liberally spiced with tales of good ol ? boys behaving badly : the home-office exec who routinely told mixed-gender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if they could trust them " with their wife and their wallet " ; the Midwestern district manager who liked to hold business meetings at Hooters ; the " Spirit Committee " of a Wisconsin store that brought in a stripper to perform at a staff session in celebration of the manager ? s birthday . // Wal-Mart workers are quitting in far greater numbers than they are filing lawsuits or signing union representation cards . Turnover among hourly employees is nearly 50 percent a year , about double the rate of Costco , which long ago supplanted its much larger rival as America ? s big-box employer of choice . //
