Raw no more , Eddie Murphy gets cooking again , making movies fit for his family // Eddie Murphy makes $20 million a film , but that 's not nearly enough to get him to cozy up to a live crocodile-not even with Steve Irwin , TV 's intrepid Crocodile Hunter , by his side . " What 's Steve Irwin going to do ? " Murphy asked Dr. Dolittle 2 director Steve Carr , launching into a dead-on imitation of the chipper Aussie . " ' Look at his powerful jaws ! He 's a beauty ! His massive jaws are literally ripping Eddie Murphy to shreds ! " ' Maybe he was worried the croc had n't gotten the word : These days Murphy is back on top of the Hollywood food chain . The bad-boy king of comedy in the ' ' 80s but more of a bad joke by the early ' ' 90s , Murphy , 40 , has revived his career by crafting a new image-and a new life-as a family man . Wed for eight years to former model Nicole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murphy has scored hit after hit with kid-friendly fare such as 1996 's The Nutty Professor , 1998 's Dr. Dolittle and last year 's Nutty Professor II : The Klumps , which together grossed about $400 million at the U.S. box office . The newly released Dolittle 2 took in $27 million its first weekend , but Murphy has already claimed a starring role in the summer 's biggest hit : the $216 million-and-counting animated Shrek , in which he supplies the voice of the ogre 's wisecracking donkey sidekick . Photograph // If Murphy has gone from Raw ( the title of his raunchy 1987 stand-up concert film ) to pasteurized , friends applaud the transformation . " He 's just so much more happy , " says producer Brian Grazer , a longtime friend . " Nicole was a very big part , but he just came to the place where he said , " I do n't need all these people  --  his notoriously vast ' ' 80s entourage- " ' depending on me , nor do I want to depend on them . " ' As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success but also " wants to make movies his kids Bria , 11 , Myles , 8 , Shayne , 6 , and Zola Ivy , 11 can watch , " says Nutty producer James Brubaker . Even the 1997 incident in which Los Angeles cops pulled Murphy over after he picked up a transvestite prostitute in his SUV ( Murphy insisted he was playing Good Samaritan and giving the prostitute a lift ) did n't significantly dent Murphy 's new image . " With Eddie , " says Dolittle producer John Davis , " the longer he is in show business , the more normal he gets . " The past few months have been both the sweetest and saddest of times for Murphy . In April Nicole threw him a surprise 40th-birthday bash at L.A. 's Cicada restaurant , where 200 friends enjoyed a set by Stevie Wonder . Then shortly after Nicole announced she is expecting early next year , Murphy 's stepfather , Vernon Lynch , who helped raise Eddie and his brother Charlie since Eddie was a youngster , died of lung cancer at ae 68 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days earlier , when he had taken a day off from the L.A. set of the comedy Showtime with Robert De Niro to visit him in New Jersey . " They had a great relationship , " says Joe Piscopo , Murphy 's pal since they starred together in the ' ' 80s on Saturday Night Live . " Vernon was a calm , loving individual , and in many ways Eddie has that calm with his kids . " Indeed , Bubble Hill , the 22-room mansion in Englewood , N.J. , that has been Murphy 's home since 1986 , has been transformed from party central to tranquil refuge . Piscopo enjoyed a typically low-key visit recently : " We sit on the front porch , talking . We joked , What happened to us ? We 're dork dads now . " ' Not entirely unhip , though : Murphy , who boxes for exercise and often attends bouts in Las Vegas , smokes friends in the video game Knockout Kings . " He 's good , " marvels his Dolittle 2 costar , 18-year-old rapper actor Lil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 , Brooklyn native Murphy ( at summer camp in 1969 ) " blew all of us away , " says costar Joe Piscopo . Photograph Murphy 's late stepfather , Vernon Lynch ( with Eddie , wife Lillian and son Vernon Jr . in 1983 ) , " encouraged Eddie to come up with ideas for movies , " says pal Brian Grazer . Photograph " You can talk to her , " Murphy said of Nicole ( at their 1993 wedding ) . " And on top of that , she 's fine . " // Murphy has also managed to mellow out on movie sets , where he once had a reputation for angry outbursts , even grabbing director John I andis by the neck during the filming of 1988 's Coming to America . But the only Dolittle 2 costars to raise Murphy 's hackles were the nonhuman ones . An admitted fraidy-cat , he relied on technical tricks to film most of his scenes with live critters ( including the one with the croc ) from a distance . Murphy seemed particularly at ease with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knockknock jokes . " Watch who you are with , and make sure you have close people around you that you can trust , " he told Cosby Show veteran Raven-Symone , 15 , who plays his older daughter . " It 's very cutthroat in Hollywood . " Murphy , of course , learned his lessons the hard way . Reared in Brooklyn and Long Island by his mother , Lillian , a telephone operator , and stepfather , Vernon , a factory foreman ( his biological father , Charles , split with I illian when Eddie was 3 and died when Eddie was 8 ) , Murphy started doing stand-up in local clubs at 15 . In 1980 , at age 19 , he became the youngest comedian ever hired by Saturday Night Live . Roles in blockbusters such as 1982 's 48 HRS and 1984 's Beverly Hills Cop catapulted Murphy into Hollywood 's highest-paid elite , and the cocky star 's ego inflated to dangerous proportions . Notorious for his womanizing ( he has financially supported two children born to two exlovers ) , he dressed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his waning years : " Anytime you see me in a leather suit with the leather gloves equals a period when I was not grounded , " Murphy said in the early ' ' 90s . Murphy 's troubles multiplied in the late ' ' 80s , when he angered gay activists with slurs and AIDS jokes in his stand-up act ( he apologized after gay leaders protested his planned appearance on David Letterman 's show in 1996 ) and was sued by actress Michael Michele , now of ER , for allegedly firing her from 1989 's Harlem Nights after she rejected his advances . ( The suit was resolved out of court . ) Even meeting Sacramento-born model Nicole in 1988and Bria 's birth in 1989-did n't slow Murphy down . " I was holding on to my youth , " he later told PEOPLE . But Nicole and fatherhood eventually won him over , and the couple wed in ' ' 93 . " I do n't think he misses his wild days at all , " says actor-director pal Keenen Ivory Wayans . Murphy 's next task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sequels and duds . He hit pay dirt with 1996 's Nutty Professor , which grossed $270 million worldwide . The prostitute incident - which Murphy termed " an act of kindness that got turned into a f  --  ing horror show " - did n't stop his maturing into what Grazer calls " a family brand . " Much in demand these days , Murphy is about to wrap the cop spoof Showtime and begin shooting a movie version of the ' ' 60s TV series I Spy . Friends say his heart today is in his tamer roles . " Nothing makes you a bigger star , " says Dolittle producer Davis , " than when you are a star in your kids ' eyes .
