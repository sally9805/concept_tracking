Irving Berlin ! 1957 It was Joseph Brodsky , the one person who had never caused any trouble , who did not want his daughter to marry David Bloom . " I will not have my grandchildren brought up on filthy money , " Joseph told his wife the evening after Miriam had called from New York with the news . Married ! Miriam had screamed so happily into the phone . Instantly Joseph remembered her , a girl in a yellow bathing suit on the dock by Sebago Lake , her hands on her hips . When had her bones grown into a woman 's body ? He imagined her limbs elongating before his eyes as if he were watching the time-lapse film of a flower blooming , a crystal forming : his daughter growing up and away from him . Joseph had been readying for sleep before the phone call . Now , sitting on the edge of his bed , he paused a moment before removing his shoes . Then he set upright the milk carton he had taken to putting by the bed so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many times during the night . Joseph was beginning to feel the effects of age  --  the real effects , ones that seemed to rise up from that strange place deep within him where his faith was stored  --  and to refuse the marriage troubled him . He wanted to be sure his daughters were taken care of . But David Bloom ? Of all the men on earth . He did n't know the boy well , it was true , but history is history . End of story . " What are you talking about , Joe ? " Esther sat at her vanity slathering her face with cold cream . " Mob ties . " Joseph nodded his head to emphasize the gravity of this statement . He thought of his own brother , the day he left Brooklyn for that gang of thugs and how his mother gave all of Solomon 's belongings  --  his comic books , shirts , his telescope with the broken lens  --  to Henrietta Szold . For the Hadassah , his mother had said . And that woman had sent the package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  without so much as a note . " How do you know for sure ? " Esther asked Joseph . " I know because I know , " he told her . Only once had Joseph discussed Solomon , and that had been when he 'd come home late from a terribly hard day on the long selling road . Frustrated by how little such a long day had yielded , Joseph walked in the door , drank three glasses of peach schnapps , told Esther the story , wept , and then tried unsuccessfully to undo his wife 's bra in the kitchen . " And how 's that ? " Esther watched in the mirror as her husband dipped his feet into his leather slippers . " For Christ 's sake , Joe . Miriam ca n't be running around that city  --  single and loose in Manhattan  --  forever . " If only from the state of her daughter 's bitten nails , Joseph knew that Esther was right . He could see that Miriam had anxieties . She 'd been neurotic since she was a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child 's bathtub filled with chemicals . Esther had found her in a ball , coiled as tightly as a pin curl . I 'm getting clean , Miriam had said when questioned as to what on earth she had been doing . But what did that mean ? My little girl , Joseph had thought when he was confronted with the image of that pink , raw body . And then the image much later , of the girl in New York , a brand-new nose hidden beneath seeping bandages . Her eyes were two bruises on the moon of that blanched , frightened face . This had been the only time Joseph had questioned his wife 's intentions . Miriam might have anxiety , but some of the Brodskys ' friends ' kids had been true problems . Ethel Cohen 's daughter was institutionalized . Drugs , they 'd said . Imagine . And Arthur Friedman 's boy was a no-good drunk . No matter how Art tried , that boy was always showing up at his doorstep at all hours , inebriated . Joseph knew he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given them a moment 's real worry . " I just know , Es . " Joseph spoke softly , rubbing his head . " Please believe me . " His scalp shone brightly , shiny as linoleum , through his thinning hair . Esther turned away from the mirror to look directly at her husband , one arm hooked over the back of the chair . Her face was a mask of white , but for her eyes , black as ebony buttons , and her pink mouth , drawn up like a change purse . Even like this , like a snowman she looks , thought Joseph , she was a treasure to him . " Whatever you say , " Esther said . " Evidently he 's not a gangster anymore . Now the man hangs around with Irving Berlin . Broadway , Joe . " Esther paused , uncharacteristically hesitant about what she was about to say . She held her head high as she looked in the mirror . " Do you want your daughter to be one of those girls in that terrible city who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a lesbian in her old age ? And that , mind you , is only if she ages well . " " Now come on , Esther , " Joseph said . The previous day Esther had read him something about the problem of single girls in the city , from " Dear Maggie , " the syndicated etiquette column that his wife and her friends phoned one another over daily . Especially since the war , Esther had read , pointing her chin toward Joseph , as if it had all been his fault . She 's your daughter too , Joseph had told her . Now Joseph turned away from his wife and to the window , the boughs of the evergreen at the side of the yard sagging with last night 's snow . Beyond his yard and down the hill was Casco Bay , where last week Joseph had seen a seal at low tide . Looking up the habits of the harbor seal at the Portland library hours after the sighting , he had had to laugh at himself . How on earth did I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencil to the side of his head as he read about molting seasons . Broadway , thought Joseph . Irving Berlin . Esther went down to New York City all the time now to see Miriam and catch a matinee , and Joseph knew this thrilled her . But Joseph , who 'd had to be begged by his wife to move so far north , rarely liked to go back to New York . He liked the peace of his new little town , where he walked to the Penny Wise for milk , removing his hat for the neighbors he passed in the street . He liked his walks through the woods , stomping over moss and earth , the pleasant smell of pine , the call of the lighthouse that blinked in the distance through the fog . The one time Esther had gone with Seymour and Sarah Bloom , she had come home chattering about the house seats and how the Blooms knew the very best places to eat on Broadway . When they came in from the street , a table by a window was waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She made it clear to Joseph that though she did n't want to live anywhere else but Portland , dinner and a show in that beautiful , beckoning city was a perfect evening . " Not just off zhe Mob , " Joseph said . " Off a people like you and me . " He slapped his chest . " Good people . " But Irving Berlin ! Joseph got up from the bed , and Esther noticed he did so a bit wearily . He looked up to see his wife rub her own throbbing hands  --  she 'd had to get her wedding ring loosened last month just so it could slide over the knuckles of her once-slender fingers  --  and clutch the bedpost to stand up . Joseph knew he was no longer the handsome and strong man Esther had once walked arm in arm with by the Charles in the late autumn afternoon , scarlet and mustard-colored leaves swish-swishing in the breeze . And he knew his wife had not planned on a man with a mother who spent most of her time on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech would always betray them . And yet , here she was , still with him . And Esther ? She was no longer the slim girl he 'd waited for on the stairwell in that boardinghouse in Cambridge , only to walk with her out into the street . Joseph had tried to make her feel that he would always be waiting for her . Slim . That had been before the kids and before the gallbladder had come out ; before she could n't stop with the cream cheese and jelly , with the damn Hershey 's . Joseph could see her now , the young girl who left Portland , Maine , for Boston to work at Filene 's Basement . The shoes ! And the folding folding folding . She complained she would go mad from it and the way the women pushed their way through her just-folded clothes , snapping them open to check for irregularities . " Irvink Berlin . " Joseph leaned down to his wife . " It 's true . " He kissed her on the forehead , lingering for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his nostrils and into his sinuses . When he took his mouth from her face , his mouth was a ring of white and Esther 's forehead was marked with the impression of his lips . " Nowhere could you have that happy feeling when you are n't stealing that extra bow , " sang Esther , slightly off-key as always . My Irving Berlin is different , thought Joseph . " From the mountains to the prairies to the ocean , " he sang to himself . " My home sweet home . " He had been born a million miles away . But this country had been good to him , and though his mother would raise her fist from her new apartment on Riverside Drive and spit on him to hear it , it was true . " And such a nice family , " Esther said of the Blooms . " Very intellectual . " She wiped the cold cream from her face . " They are nice , " Joseph said again . " Vestern European . " He shook his head as he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern Europeans , and how they all longed to be from music , and art , from the land where they drank tea out of the most delicate of china cups . He was walking toward the bathroom . That side of Europe , they had the culture , it 's true , he thought , one really ca n't deny it . And Miriam is in love . But the past . The past . At the threshold of their bedroom , he turned . " It 's a good match ? " he asked his wife . " It 's a good match , Joe , " Esther said , nodding her head slowly . Joseph blocked the idea of his daughter 's future father-in-law at the " right " end of a gun . Perhaps all the rumors of Seymour 's involvement with Solomon had not been true , he reasoned . Perhaps Seymour , thanks to his exceptionally good fortune and his high profile on Broadway , was only a victim of bad publicity . Walking down the hallway to the bathroom , Joseph whistled " God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wedding , he thought . What would I say if I were to meet him ? Tell him : our lives are parallel fairy tales . Or perhaps I should prepare a rhyming greeting . Joseph had begun to devise a limerick to make Irving Berlin smile when , upon reaching the bathroom , the image of his brother overwhelmed him . Bangbangbangbang went his heart . Only it was n't love now , as when he saw Esther laughing for the very first time . Who cared she 'd laughed at him as his hat spun away into traffic ? This was an age-old grief , and for a moment Joseph thought the pain of it would split him in half . His brother . It was unbearable how he missed Solomon . Solomon , who 'd left South Fifth Street and come back with more money than God . Joseph remembered the kids pitching pennies on the cracked sidewalk and a horse-drawn ice wagon knocking by as Solomon walked the block in a purple suit that shone when the smallest crease caught the light . Even from here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East River , tethering his neighborhood to the world . Sol came in throwing cash from his enormous wads of bills clasped in silver clips , and their mother screamed and ran from it . Joseph laughed now to remember his mother trying not to step in the horse manure on the street as she ran from Solomon 's money . Selma Brodsky had told Joseph that her elder son 's dirty money would scald them both , that their skin would burn as if from acid and would shrink back from their bands of muscle , and what , then , would people see ? Joseph had wondered then about his mother 's insides , saddened , ruled by fear . His insides ? Hope . As a boy , Joseph had followed his older brother down the street , crowded with horses and carts and boys playing stickball , on the way to Mr. Berkowitz 's candy store : Wait for me ! he 'd called out to him . Solly ! he 'd screamed . And then , just as soon as it had come , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold , clean marble of the counter . Joseph splashed cold water on his face and looked into the mirror , shaking the image of his mother screeching like a dying animal as she tried to dodge Solomon 's money . Destroyed , she 'd say in Yiddish . Mekhule . That was when Joseph had decided he would work hard for money so clean his mother could wrap a baby  --  his someday  --  in the bills he would earn for her . And he had . " Joe ? " Esther screamed from the bedroom . " Are you coming to bed ? " " In a moment , " Joseph said , staring into the glass .
