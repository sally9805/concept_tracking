THE ENVIRONMENT <P> The G.O.P. will propose an energy bill that includes drilling in Alaska 's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , long opposed by enviros . Also likely is revival of a proposal to increase logging in some areas to reduce the threat of wildfires ; opponents call it a giveaway to the timber industry . Incoming Environment Committee chairman James Inhofe of Oklahoma is pro-industry . It 's a dark time for the greens . <P> THE ECONOMY <P> Republicans want to make permanent last year 's $1.35 trillion tax cuts , which are scheduled to expire in 2010 . In the Senate , some members will push to cut capital-gains taxes , eliminate the estate tax and completely overhaul the tax code . In the House , Republicans want a package that would allow small investors to write off as much as $9,000 in stock-market losses instead of the current $3,000 . Who cares about the budget deficit ? <P> THE WAR <P> The President already has authorization from Congress for the possible use of force against Iraq , and now he also has a U.N @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will only lift his support if he decides military action is needed . Democrats and Republicans pretty much agree that Bush has a blank check . The only difference the elections made is that there will be a whole lot less whining from Congress about not being consulted on any military action . <P> HEALTH CARE <P> Republican leader Trent Lott will press for the G.O.P. version of a Medicare prescription-drug benefit that would work through private insurers . The drug industry likes it because it is less likely to lead to price controls . Democrats oppose the measure and prefer a government-administered benefit . Drug industry  --  backed groups like the United Seniors Association spent millions this fall on advertising that benefited G.O.P. candidates . A Republican-sponsored , less expansive version of a patient 's bill of rights also has the edge . <P> HOMELAND SECURITY <P> A bill to consolidate other agencies into one overarching antiterrorism department is Bush 's first priority , and will now move quickly through Congress . Senate Democrats had been holding out for giving employees the same civil-service protection that other government workers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another Bush priority : approval of government-backed terrorism insurance for business . <P> THE COURTS <P> Republicans will move quickly to confirm 18 judicial nominees who have already passed committee and to get the judiciary panel to act on three who have had hearings but no votes . Likely to be back : Priscilla Owen and Charles Pickering , two appellate-court nominees rejected by the Democratic-controlled committee .
