<p> WASHINGTON - One month into an election campaign that is already setting marks for duration , cost and polarizing intensity , President Bush and Sen. John Kerry appear locked in a grueling and volatile struggle . <p> Bush 's re-election hopes have been rocked by bloody uprisings in Iraq , a record spike in casualties , and disclosures about the administration 's lax response to terrorism before the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks . <p> Kerry has endured a perilous time as well . During the period when Americans were forming their initial impressions of the Democratic challenger , his Republican foes used their commanding financial advantage to buy TV ads that paint him as a tax-hiking flip-flopper . <p> To some extent , these two political trials have served to cancel each other out , leaving the country as profoundly divided as it was at the end of the 2000 election , with Bush still favored , but by no means assured , in his race for re- <p> election . <p> ' Parity has turned into intense polarization. a There truly have become two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican pollster Ed Goeas in a strategic analysis of the latest bipartisan ' Battleground Poll . ' <p> ' One side clearly identifies with President Bush as a strong , moral , decisive leader , ' wrote Goeas , whose firm performs work for the Bush campaign . ' The other side sees Bush as an ineffectual leader who has ignored the war on terrorism to pursue a vendetta against Saddam Hussein in Iraq . ' <p> Said Goeas : ' This presidential election truly appears to be starting exactly where it left off in November of 2000 - with all the intensity of the final days of a campaign . ' <p> ' Every issue that comes out , you see an instant polarization , ' says William Schneider , a political analyst for the American Enterprise Institute , a conservative think tank in Washington . <p> The tightness of the race is focusing attention on the potential effects of a third candidate - independent Ralph Nader . <p> By threatening to take votes of liberals and anti-war activists who might otherwise support a Democrat , Nader may force Kerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avowed plans to target the votes of centrists , independents and swing voters . <p> ' The peace movement in this country is going to have an interesting choice , ' says Nader . He calls for a withdrawal of U.S. forces , and says that Kerry , by endorsing a continuing American presence in Iraq , is trying to ' out-Bush Bush . ' <p> Bush has fewer problems with his own Republican base , although conservative leaders have displayed some restlessness in recent weeks about Iraq , excessive federal spending in GOP-controlled Washington , and the $ 500 billion U.S. budget deficit . <p> The intense polarization has led campaign strategists on both sides to write off two-thirds of the 50 states , including Colorado , California , New York and Texas , as conquered territory . Voters in the 17 or 18 other ' battleground states , ' which went for one candidate or the other by a narrow margin in 2000 , are being inundated with television advertising . <p> The battleground states include major prizes such as Ohio and Pennsylvania but also states with less Electoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevada and New Hampshire . <p> Bush won Colorado with just 51 percent of the vote in 2000 , with Al Gore getting 42 percent and Nader 5 percent . But the number of registered Democrats lags behind both independents and Republican voters in the state , and neither presidential campaign has made a significant investment . <p> ' Colorado is on the watch list , ' says Democratic pollster Celinda Lake , who works with Goeas on the Battleground Poll . <p> Lingering just outside the battleground circle , Colorado is something of a bellwether . If Bush and Kerry launch heavy campaign advertising in Colorado , it will be a clear sign that the president is in trouble , in the state and across the country . <p> The most recent polls hold good news , as well as disturbing portents , for the president . In the latest national survey conducted by The Washington Post and ABC News , Bush led Kerry by 47 percent to 42 percent after trailing by a nearly identical margin in early March . Nader had 7 percent . The poll was conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three percentage points . <p> ' Perceptions of Kerry are forming , and most participants had some opinion of him , frequently reflecting the messages delivered in the Bush and Kerry television commercials , ' says a report on focus group research from Democracy Corps , an organization led by Democratic consultants James Carville and Stanley Greenberg . <p> ' A dominant attitude was that Kerry changes his position on issues and tells people what they want to hear ; he will also raise their taxes , ' the consultants acknowledge . ' And while people recognize his military service , for now negative perceptions driven by the media dominate the positive ones . ' <p> But it took a fortune - $ 50 million in spending , including more than $ 40 million on campaign advertising - for Bush to blacken Kerry 's name and dent the Democrat 's momentum . <p> Political analysts question whether the ads will have a lasting impact , running as they did when the news was dominated by uprisings in Iraq and the White House tussle with the commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania 's Annenberg Public Policy Center concludes that there have been ' no statistically significant differences in results ' between respondents in the battleground states and those who live elsewhere . <p> And all that money has done little to improve what voters think about Bush . His approval rating soared to 92 percent after the Sept. 11 attacks , and spiked again last spring to 77 percent with the quick capture of Baghdad . But an anemic job market , the increased number of Americans killed or wounded in Iraq and the vocal emergence of Democratic critics in the presidential primary process have led to a steady decline . <p> In modern presidential politics , Goeas notes , every incumbent president with a job approval rating of 50 percent or higher at this point in the campaign has won re-election . Bush 's approval rating is now 50 percent . <p> The president got good economic news in March , and a few months of solid job growth will boost his approval rating and his chances for re-election . Yet the recent turn of events in Iraq threatens support for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing as a leader in the battle to keep the U.S. safe from terrorism . <p> In the Post-ABC poll , two of three Americans , when weighing the goals versus the costs of the war , believe we are taking ' unacceptable ' casualties in Iraq ; almost as many - three out of five - say the U.S. is ' bogged down . ' <p> In the ongoing Annenberg survey , which also has a margin of error of 3 percentage points , 57 percent of those surveyed in the first two weeks of April said the war in Iraq had increased the risk of terrorism against the United States . <p> ' Iraq is dividing Americans more and more , ' says Schneider . <p> One of Bush 's biggest political strengths is that he is viewed as a forceful , decisive leader . His steady performance in the weeks after Sept. 11 , 2001 , brought him a reservoir of trust and regard from his fellow Americans that enabled him to fend off questions from the 9/11 commission about how he and his aides dealt with warnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their president . Presidential elections are generally referendums on an incumbent . A continued deterioration of the situation in Iraq , a terrorist strike on the mainland or the continued failure to find Osama bin Laden could persuade the electorate to opt for a change in the White House . <p> ' What we are seeing is , unfortunately , a gradual spread of the view among Iraqis that they are dealing with an assertive , ham- <p> handed occupation that 's foreign and humiliating them . And therefore I expect the violence to rise up , ' says Zbigniew Brzezinski , who served as national security adviser to President Carter . <p> With more than 100 Americans killed , April is already the bloodiest month of the invasion and occupation of Iraq . <p> ' The risks are far higher than the president portrayed , and a great many mistakes have shaped the situation , ' says Anthony Cordesman , an expert on Middle East security issues for the Center for Strategic and International Studies , a think tank in Washington . ' Most of the problems we face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a realistic assessment of what needed to be done in Iraq once Saddam fell . ' <p> At a moment when the country is looking to the Oval Office for resolve , Kerry 's ever-nuanced positions on Iraq put him in a poor position to capitalize on the administration 's foreign-policy blunders , as may a growing division in opinion about the war among his natural constituencies . <p> Kerry must be mindful , as Nader surely is , that 44 percent of Democrats , 50 percent of liberals and 40 percent of independents think the U.S. should bring its troops home ' as soon as possible ' rather than waiting ' until a stable government is established there , ' according to the Annenberg survey . <p> In so polarized an atmosphere , Democrats hungry to dump Bush seem willing , so far , to give Kerry a pass . The senator raised a record $ 50 million in the first quarter of the year , including $ 38 million in March . Having absorbed Bush 's $ 40 million punch , Kerry can now soak the airwaves with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twists of the campaign remind Goeas of the classic Magic 8-Ball toy , which occasionally would respond with the message : " Answer unclear , ask again later .
