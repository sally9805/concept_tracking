Introduction In November 1987 , a deputy sheriff was dispatched to an apartment building in Dutchess County , upstate New York . There a resident of the building led him to a large plastic garbage bag that contained a seemingly unconscious Tawana Brawley . Brawley 's body was smeared with feces , her clothes were torn , the crotch burned away from her jeans , and she was not wearing a bra or underwear . An ambulance was dispatched , and Brawley was taken to the hospital . When her clothes were removed , the markings were stark and unambiguous : the words " nigger , " " bitch , " and " KKK " were scrawled on Brawley 's torso in black charcoal . // The sheriff 's office , sensing that they were in over their heads , called the FBI to report a likely civil rights violation . Doctors examined Brawley for injuries and evidence of rape . They found neither . Brawley could not-or refused to-speak to hospital staff and detectives about what had happened . Eventually , communicating by nodding and shaking her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several men . Then came the bombshell . When asked if she could identify the attackers , the silent Brawley scrawled two words on a piece of paper : " white cop . " // When Brawley was released from the hospital , her family thought a warm bed and an interview with a New York City television station might help her to rest and recover . Against the advice of the hospital social worker , her mother and aunt publicized the horrifying story . They did so , they said , out of fear that the incident would be covered up by a racist law enforcement establishment . // The last thing they needed to worry about was too little publicity . The family enlisted ( or was conscripted by ) lawyers Alton Maddox and C. Vernon Mason and the Reverend Al Sharpton . Thereafter , " Brawley 's story " ( she never told her own story publicly , which gave her representatives plenty of , let 's say , interpretive license ) was the featured topic of discussion on innumerable news and current events programs , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its down-market competitor , The Morton Downey Jr . Show . Sharpton-not Brawley-named names , accusing a local police officer , who later committed suicide , and assistant district attorney Steven Pagones , who later successfully sued Sharpton for defamation . Sharpton-not Brawley-spun a conspiracy theory worthy of its own X File , implicating the Irish Republican Army , the Cosa Nostra , New York governor Mario Cuomo , and a mysterious man with a missing finger . ( Could Dr. Richard Kimble 's one-armed man have been out of the loop ? ) // Something was badly awry . Even without Sharpton 's embellishments , Brawley 's story-to the extent that she told one-did n't jibe . Witnesses saw her climb into the garbage bag herself after looking around furtively . All of the materials necessary to stage the assault were found in her old apartment . She was seen at a party shortly before she was discovered by police . When examined at the hospital , she showed no signs of exposure despite subfreezing temperatures , suggesting that she had n't been outside for long . Brawley never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had to explain them : on the advice of her lawyers , she refused to cooperate with police and prosecutors , so she never gave a detailed account of events . She was spirited away to undisclosed locations while her handlers gave incendiary interviews to the press and spun race-baiting conspiracy theories . Sharpton , in a heartwarming display of sensitivity , said that asking Brawley to meet with New York 's Jewish attorney general would be like asking a Holocaust survivor " to sit down with Mr. Hitler . " // A grand jury found no evidence of wrongdoing and concluded that the whole affair was probably a hoax . To this day we can not know whether Brawley was assaulted by someone-named or unnamed , known to her or unknown-whether she was cajoled or pressured into playing a role in an elaborately orchestrated hoax , or whether she just made the whole thing up . Owing in large part to the exploitation of the case by her lawyers and handlers , any truth is so intermeshed with a tissue of lies that there 's no separating the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still available for charlatans and demagogues to cite as evidence of an elaborate white racist conspiracy . For such people and those who believe them , the Tawana Brawley incident is a reason to resist law enforcement , to distrust the criminal justice system , and to secede from mainstream society into black separatist cults such as Louis Farrakhan 's Nation of Islam . ( Farrakhan has vowed vengeance on Brawley 's attackers : " You raped my daughter , and I will kill you and dismember your body and feed it to the fowl of the air , " he frothed . ) But for most people , whatever else it was , the Tawana Brawley debacle was a prime example of the damage done-to lives , to reputations , to careers , and most of all to the truth-by playing the race card . // Almost all Americans agree that racism is wrong . Many believe that it remains a serious problem that affects many people on a regular basis . But a lot of people also worry that the charge of racism can be abused . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assault seemed to have been a staged hoax . Michael Jackson-a musician who enjoyed the most lucrative career in the history of recorded music-teamed up with Brawley 's former handler , Al Sharpton , to accuse his recording label , Sony Music , of a " racist conspiracy " to undermine his popularity after sales of his disappointing latest album are , well , disappointing . The multimillionaire-who , through untold plastic surgeries , has achieved the Aryan phenotype of Snow White-declared fearlessly , " When you fight for me , you 're fighting for all black people , dead and alive . " ( That rumbling you hear is the sound of thousands of former slaves , sharecroppers , and victims of Jim Crow turning in their graves . ) Prince , a musician whose contract was not quite as good as Michael Jackson 's but still extraordinarily generous , complained that he was a " slave " to his record label ( years later Prince made a deal with Jackson 's old label , Sony , apparently unafraid of the racist conspiracy ) . Clarence Thomas , when charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court of the United States , compared his critics to a lynch mob . And of course there 's O. J. Simpson . We all know what happened with O. J. Simpson ( do n't we ? ) . // The Race Card will examine the prevalence of dubious and questionable accusations of racism and other types of bias . I will argue that the social and legal meaning of " racism " is in a state of crisis : the term now has no single clear and agreed-upon meaning . As a result , it is available to describe an increasingly wide range of disparate policies , attitudes , decisions , and social phenomena . This leads to disagreement and confusion . Self-serving individuals , rabble-rousers , and political hacks use accusations of racism , sexism , homophobia , and other types of " bias " tactically , in order to advance their own ends . And people of goodwill may make sincere claims that strike others as obviously wrongheaded. // In a sense , the Tawana Brawley incident was a classic example of playing the race card : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to gain something they did n't deserve-notoriety , attention , money , public support for their controversial racial politics . But in another sense the incident was atypical . Playing the race card typically involves jumping to a conclusion not compelled by the facts ; Michael Jackson 's album sales were disappointing-that 's a fact-but it 's far from obvious that they were disappointing because Jackson was the victim of racism . By contrast , it appears that Brawley or her handlers actually fabricated the injuries , as well as disingenuously claiming that racism was to blame for them . The Brawley incident did n't involve jumping to a conclusion that the facts did n't support ; it involved making up facts that would support the desired conclusion . // Still , this unusual case demonstrates something about playing the race card more generally : false or exaggerated claims of bias piggyback on real instances of victimization . They " work " because there are enough similar verified cases for the lies and exaggerations to seem plausible . Brawley 's story was plausible to many people because they knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police , and they sometimes abuse black people . When asked many years later whether he would apologize for his role in the incident , Reverend Sharpton defended his conduct : " Apologize for what ? For believing a young lady ? " People who believed Brawley did so because they gave her , rather than the police , the benefit of the doubt . They began with the presumption that black people often suffer from racism and police often lie . People who began with the opposite presumption-that blacks rarely suffer from racism and police are usually truthful-never believed her . In the Brawley case , the latter presumption yielded the correct conclusion . But that does n't make it a superior presumption in general . It would have yielded the wrong conclusion in many other cases , such as when New York police did indeed sexually abuse a black man-Abner Louima-and lied about it in an unsuccessful cover-up attempt . // The cases of Brawley and Louima involved objective facts that people could observe and verify . But many claims of racism do n't involve such hard facts ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't observe directly . Consider the following high-stakes struggle , where many people think the winner played the race card . // * * * // The year 1991 marked the end of an era in American civil rights . Thurgood Marshall-the first black Supreme Court justice , the lead attorney for the NAACP in the historic racial desegregation case Brown v. Board of Education-announced his intention to retire from the bench . Immediately the speculation and maneuvering concerning Marshall 's replacement began . It was widely expected that another African American would be-indeed , would have to be-appointed . Liberals and civil rights groups began a predictable campaign directed at the Republican president-George H. W. Bush-who would nominate Marshall 's successor . It was crucial , they insisted , that the nation 's highest court include a person of color . The Bush administration would demonstrate the racial insensitivity-indeed bigotry-that its enemies had long suspected if it appointed a white person to fill this vacancy . Partisan politics and ideological litmus tests surely should be put aside in this instance . Marshall 's vacancy should be filled by a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minorities in this country . // If it had its druthers , the Bush administration would certainly appoint a conservative . And the most prominent conservative judges were white . But Republicans could n't afford to ignore the race issue . Part of the GOP 's long-term strategy involved improving its dismal level of support among minorities . But the party could n't shake its reputation as racially insensitive or downright racist . Its long-lived " Southern strategy " relied on race-baiting to deliver white votes to GOP candidates . Bush had been elected , in part , on the strength of a notorious ad campaign that many felt exploited racial bigotry . The ad pilloried Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis for supporting a program that allowed prison inmates to take " furloughs " from incarceration . The ad informed the public that a convicted murderer , Willie Horton , beat a man and raped his fianc ? e after failing to return from furlough . The ad prominently featured Horton 's menacing black face , complete with shaggy Black Panther Afro and beard . Bush 's campaign manager , Lee Atwater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , Willie Horton will be a household name . " Atwater did not exaggerate . By the end of the campaign , one might have thought Horton was Dukakis 's running mate . The ad may have helped Bush win the election , but it did n't help Bush or the Republicans improve their standing with African Americans . // Bush faced a dilemma . If he nominated a white conservative to the Supreme Court , it would reinforce the perception that he and the Republicans were insensitive to racial injustice , hostile to civil rights , even closet racists . But the black judges with the stature and experience for the position were civil rights liberals . // Beltway conservatives must have bristled at this bind . The liberals were using a blatant racial quota-something conservatives vehemently opposed on principle-to push the president to a more liberal nominee . Many of the " New Right " became conservatives in reaction to this kind of identity politics . They had seen their neighborhood schools forcibly integrated through racial busing imposed by liberal judges . They felt that their cherished family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chic and caved in to the pressures of black nationalist mau-mauing and feminist hectoring . " Disadvantaged minorities " displaced their sons in the entering classes of Ivy League universities ; militant feminists demanded integration , disrupting the comfortable esprit de corps of campus men 's clubs . The traditional liberal arts curriculum had been watered down with overtly political ethnic and feminist authors , a concession to a misguided and trendy pluralism . The grande dame of classical education-Western Civilization-had been raped by radicals and begat such bastardizations as " World Civilizations " and " Cultures , Ideas , and Values . " In the newly hyper-liberal colleges , they had been forced to sit through what they felt were self-righteous screeds about " white male oppression , " and they were browbeaten by pious professors and students alike , each competing to be more sensitive and tolerant than thou . // And were the people who got into college through race and gender quotas grateful to be there ? Hardly . Instead , they harangued and harassed , complained and cajoled for ethnic studies , feminist studies , special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workshops . They held marches , sit-ins , and rallies for every conceivable left-wing cause . // And it was n't enough for them to have their special self-segregated programs ( the rationale of integration was conveniently forgotten once they had bullied their way in ) . They also wanted to piss on everyone else 's fun . The only silver lining in all this cloudy " social progress " was that the introduction of large numbers of women made it easier to get lucky . But the feminists were quick to put a stop to that : they pressed for sex harassment codes , turned dorm counselors into antisex police , and proposed fraternization rules so strict that you had to get a signed and notarized consent form before you could so much as ask a coed out on a date . They bullied the **25;401;TOOLONG in many cases-to kill off the Greek system just because a party or two got a little bit out of hand . // When graduation finally came , these same malcontents followed the conservatives right into government and private industry , making the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gender " sensitivity training " at work . There were new rules everywhere to make sure no one 's delicate sensibilities were ever " offended . " And now they were doing it again , playing the race card to force the president of the United States to choose a left-wing affirmative action nominee for the Supreme Court . // But conservatives had an ace up their sleeves . A black conservative with just enough experience to be a plausible candidate but not so much as to have left a long paper trail of controversial published opinions . One can imagine the number of champagne corks that popped the night someone-maybe a young , up-and-coming member of the Federalist Society-made his career in conservative politics with the suggestion " Clarence Thomas . " Imagine the strategy meeting of some unknown conservative think tank . The jowly old guard grumbling ; the fresh-faced Young Turks scowling . Marshall 's getting up in years ; what to do if he retires while our team is in the White House ? How do we deal with the race issue ? Then someone says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics jujitsu : use the enemy 's strength against him . We have to pick a black nominee ? Fine . We 'll give you a black nominee so conservative he makes Edmund Burke look like Che Guevara . So what that he 's just barely been appointed to the federal bench ? Are the quota-crazy affirmative action liberals going to say that a black candidate is unqualified ? // ( Continues ... ) //
