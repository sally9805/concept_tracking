1 Harry cut through the morning rush-hour crowd like a shark fin through water . I was following from twenty meters back on the opposite side of the street , sweating with everyone else in the unseasonable October Tokyo heat , and I could n't help admiring how well the kid had learned what I 'd taught him . He was like liquid the way he slipped through a space just before it closed , or drifted to the left to avoid an emerging bottleneck . The changes in Harry 's cadence were accomplished so smoothly that no one would recognize he had altered his pace to narrow the gap on our target , who was now moving almost conspicuously quickly down Dogenzaka toward Shibuya Station . The target 's name was Yasuhiro Kawamura . He was a career bureaucrat connected with the Liberal Democratic Party , or LDP , the political coalition that has been running Japan almost without a break since the war . His current position was vice minister of land and infrastructure at the Kokudokotsusho , the successor to the old Construction Ministry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously offend someone because serious offense is the only reason I ever get a call from a client . I heard Harry 's voice in my ear : " He 's going into the Higashimura fruit store . I 'll set up ahead . " We were each sporting a Danish-made , **25;412;TOOLONG receiver small enough to nestle in the ear canal , where you 'd need a flashlight to find it . A voice transmitter about the same size goes under the jacket lapel . The transmissions are burst UHF , which makes them very hard to pick up if you do n't know exactly what you 're looking for , and they 're scrambled in case you do . The equipment freed us from having to maintain constant visual contact , and allowed us to keep moving for a while if the target stopped or changed direction . So even though I was too far back to see it , I knew where Kawamura had exited , and I could continue walking for some time before having to stop to keep my position behind him . Solo surveillance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . About twenty meters from the Higashimura , I turned off into a drugstore , one of the dozens of open-faade structures that line Dogenzaka , catering to the Japanese obsession with health nostrums and germ fighting . Shibuya is home to many different buzoku , or tribes , and members of several were represented here this morning , united by a common need for one of the popular bottled energy tonics in which the drugstores specialize , tonics claiming to be bolstered with ginseng and other exotic ingredients but delivering instead with a more prosaic jolt of ordinary caffeine . Waiting in front of the register were several gray-suited sarariman- " salary man , " corporate rank and file-their faces set , cheap briefcases dangling from tired hands , fortifying themselves for another interchangeable day in the maw of the corporate machine . Behind them , two empty-faced teenage girls , their hair reduced to steel-wool brittleness by the dyes they used to turn it orange , noses pierced with oversized rings , their costumes meant to proclaim rejection of the traditional route chosen by the sarariman in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen instead . And a gray-haired retiree , his skin sagging but his face oddly bright , probably in Shibuya to avail himself of one of the area 's well-known sexual services , which he would pay for out of a pension account that he kept hidden from his wife , not realizing that she knew what he was up to and simply did n't care . I wanted to give Kawamura about three minutes to get his fruit before I came out , so I examined a selection of bandages that gave me a view of the street . The way he had ducked into the store looked like a move calculated to flush surveillance , and I did n't like it . If we had n't been hooked up the way we were , Harry would have had to stop abruptly to maintain his position behind the target . He might have had to do something ridiculous , like tie his shoe or stop to read a street sign , and Kawamura , probably peering out of the entranceway of the store , could have made him . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he would stop about twenty meters ahead , give me his location , and fall in behind when I told him the parade was moving again . The fruit store was a good spot to turn off , all right-too good for someone who knew the route to have chosen it by accident . But Harry and I were n't going to be flushed out by amateur moves out of some government antiterrorist primer . I 've had that training , so I know how useful it is . I left the drugstore and continued down Dogenzaka , more slowly than before because I had to give Kawamura time to come out of the store . Shorthand thoughts shot through my mind : Are there enough people between us to obscure his vision if he turns when he comes out ? What shops am I passing if I need to duck off suddenly ? Is anyone looking up the street at the people heading toward the station , maybe helping Kawamura spot surveillance ? If I had already drawn any countersurveillance attention , they might notice me now , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now I was taking my time , and people on their way to work do n't change their pace that way . But Harry had been the one walking point , the more conspicuous position , and I had n't done anything to arouse attention before stopping in the drugstore . I heard Harry again : " I 'm at one-oh-nine . " Meaning he had turned into the landmark 109 Department Store , famous for its collection of 109 restaurants and trendy boutiques . " No good , " I told him . " The first floor is lingerie . You going to blend in with fifty teenage girls in blue sailor school uniforms picking out padded bras ? " " I was planning to wait outside , " he replied , and I could imagine him blushing . The front of 109 is a popular meeting place , typically crowded with a polyglot collection of pedestrians . " Sorry , I thought you were going for the lingerie , " I said , suppressing the urge to smile . " Just hang back and wait for my signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fruit store was only ten meters ahead , and still no sign of Kawamura . I was going to have to slow down . I was on the opposite side of the street , outside Kawamura 's probable range of concern , so I could take a chance on just stopping , maybe to fiddle with a cell phone . Still , if he looked , he would spot me standing there , even though , with my father 's Japanese features , I do n't have a problem blending into the crowds . Harry , a pet name for Haruyoshi , being born of two Japanese parents , has never had to worry about sticking out . When I returned to Tokyo in the early eighties , my brown hair , a legacy from my mother , worked for me the way a fluorescent vest does for a hunter , and I had to dye it black to develop the anonymity that protects me now . But in the last few years the country has gone mad for chappatsu , or tea-color dyed hair , and I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like to tell Harry he 's going to have to go chappatsu if he wants to fit in , but Harry 's too much of an otaku , a geek , to give much thought to issues like personal appearance . I guess he does n't have that much to work with , anyway : an awkward smile that always looks like it 's offered in anticipation of a blow , a tendency to blink rapidly when he 's excited , a face that 's never lost its baby fat , its pudginess accentuated by a shock of thick black hair that on bad days seems almost to float above it . But the same qualities that keep him off magazine covers confer the unobtrusiveness that makes for effective surveillance . I had reached the point where I was sure I was going to have to stop when Kawamura popped out of the fruit store and reentered the flow . I hung back as much as possible to increase the space between us , watching his head bobbing as he moved down the street . He was tall for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark suit like ninety percent of the other people in this crowd-including Harry and me , naturally , so I could n't drop back too far . Just as I 'd redeveloped the right distance , he stopped and turned to light a cigarette . I continued moving slowly behind and to the right of the group of people that separated us , knowing he would n't be able to make me moving with the crowd . I kept my attention focused on the backs of the suits in front of me , just a bored morning commuter . After a moment he turned and started moving again . I allowed myself the trace of a satisfied smile . Japanese do n't stop to light cigarettes ; if they did , they 'd lose weeks over the course of their adult lives . Nor was there any reason , such as a strong headwind threatening to blow out a match , for him to turn and face the crowd behind him . Kawamura 's obvious attempt at countersurveillance simply confirmed his guilt . Guilt of what I do n't know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few questions . Is the target a man ? I do n't work against women or children . Have you retained anyone else to solve this problem ? I do n't want my operation getting tripped up by someone 's idea of a B-team , and if you retain me , it 's an exclusive . Is the target a principal ? I solve problems directly , like the soldier I once was , not by sending messages through uninvolved third parties like a terrorist . The concerns behind the last question are why I like to see independent evidence of guilt : It confirms that the target is indeed the principal and not a clueless innocent . Twice in eighteen years the absence of that evidence has stayed my hand . Once I was sent against the brother of a newspaper editor who was publishing stories on corruption in a certain politician 's home district . The other time it was against the father of a bank reformer who showed excessive zeal in investigating the size and nature of his institution 's bad debts . I would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reformer , had I been retained to do so , but apparently the clients in question had reason to pursue a more circuitous route that involved misleading me . They are no longer clients , of course . Not at all . I 'm not a mercenary , although I was nothing more than that once upon a time . And although I do in a sense live a life of service , I am no longer samurai , either . The essence of samurai is not just service , but loyalty to his master , to a cause greater than himself . There was a time when I burned with loyalty , a time when , suffused with the samurai ethic I had absorbed from escapist novels and comics as a boy in Japan , I was prepared to die in the service of my adopted liege lord , the United States . But loves as uncritical and unrequited as that one can never last , and usually come to a dramatic end , as mine did . I am a realist now . As I came to the 109 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my lapel or anything stupid like that ; the transmitters are sensitive enough so that you do n't need to make any subtle movements that are like billboards for a trained countersurveillance team . Not that one was out there , but you always assume the worst . Harry would know I was passing his position and would fall in after a moment . Actually , the popularity of cell phones with earpieces makes this kind of work easier than it once was . It used to be that someone walking alone and talking under his breath was either demented or an intelligence or security agent . Today you see this sort of behavior all the time among Japan 's keitai , or cell phone , generation . The light at the bottom of Dogenzaka was red , and the crowd congealed as we approached the five-street intersection in front of the train station . Garish neon signs and massive video monitors flashed frantically on the buildings around us . A diesel-powered truck ground its gears as it slogged through the intersection , laborious as a barge in a muddy river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drowned out the bells commuters on bicycles were ringing to warn pedestrians out of the way . A street hawker angled a pushcart through the crowds , sweat running down the sides of his face , the smell of steamed fish and rice following in his zigzagging wake . An ageless homeless man , probably a former sarariman who had lost his job and his moorings when the bubble burst in the late eighties , slept propped against the base of a streetlight , inured by alcohol or despair to the tempest around him . The Dogenzaka intersection is like this night and day , and at rush hour , when the light turns green , over three hundred people step off the curb at the same instant , with another twenty-five thousand waiting in the crush . From here on , it was going to be shoulder to shoulder , chest to back . I would keep close to Kawamura now , no more than five meters , which would put about two hundred people between us . I knew he had a commuter pass and would n't need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased our tickets in advance so we would be able to follow him right through the wickets . Not that the attendant would notice one way or the other . At rush hour , they 're practically numbed by the hordes ; you could flash anything , a baseball card , probably , and in you 'd go . The light changed , and the crowds swept into one another like a battle scene from some medieval epic . An invisible radar I 'm convinced is possessed only by Tokyoites prevented a mass of collisions in the middle of the street . I watched Kawamura as he cut diagonally across to the station , and maneuvered in behind him as he passed . There were five people between us as we surged past the attendant 's booth . I had to stay close now . It would be chaos when the train pulled in : five thousand people pouring out , five thousand people stacked fifteen deep waiting to get on , everyone jockeying for position . Foreigners who think of Japan as a polite society have never ridden the Yamanote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs and onto the platform , and the sounds and smells of the station seemed to arouse an extra sense of urgency in the crowd . We were swimming upstream against the people who had just gotten off the train , and as we reached the platform the doors were already closing on handbags and the odd protruding elbow . By the time we had passed the kiosk midway down the platform , the last car had passed us and a moment later it was gone . The next train would arrive in two minutes . Kawamura shuffled down the middle of the platform . I stayed behind him but hung back from the tracks , avoiding his wake . He was looking up and down the platform , but even if he had spotted Harry or me earlier , seeing us waiting for the train was n't going to unnerve him . Half the people waiting had just walked down Dogenzaka . I felt the rumble of the next train as Harry walked past me like a fighter jet buzzing a carrier control tower , the slightest nod of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had told him I only needed his help until Kawamura was on the train , which is where he had always gone during our previous surveillance . Harry had done his usual good work in helping me get close to the target , and , per our script , he was now exiting the scene . I would contact him later , when I was done with the solo aspects of the job . Harry thinks I 'm a private investigator and that all I do is follow these people around collecting information . To avoid the suspicious appearance of a too-high mortality rate for the subjects we track , I often have him follow people in whom I have no interest , who of course then provide some measure of cover by continuing to live their happy and oblivious lives . Also , where possible , I avoid sharing the subject 's name with Harry to minimize the chances that he 'll come across too many coincidental obituaries . Still , some of our subjects do have a habit of dying at the end of surveillance , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't asked , which is good . I like Harry as an asset and would n't want him to become a liability . I moved up close behind Kawamura , just another commuter trying to get a good position for boarding the train . This was the most delicate part of the operation . If I flubbed it , he would make me and it would be difficult to get sufficiently close to him for a second try . My right hand dipped into my pants pocket and touched a **25;439;TOOLONG magnet , about the size and weight of a quarter . On one side the magnet was covered with blue worsted cloth , like that of the suit Kawamura was wearing . Had it been necessary , I could have stripped away the blue to expose a layer of gray , which was the other color Kawamura favored . On the opposite side of the magnet was an adhesive backing . I withdrew the magnet from my pocket and protected it from view by cupping it in my hands . I would have to wait for the right moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be enough . Maybe as we were boarding the train . I peeled off the wax paper covering the adhesive and crumbled it into my left pants pocket . The train emerged at the end of the platform and hurtled toward us . Kawamura pulled a cell phone out of his breast pocket . Started to input a number . Okay , do it now . I brushed past him , placing the magnet on his suit jacket just below the left shoulder blade , and moved several paces down the platform . Kawamura spoke into the phone for only a few seconds , too softly for me to hear over the screeching brakes of the train slowing to a halt in front of us , and then slipped the phone back in his left breast pocket . I wondered whom he had called . It did n't matter . Two stations ahead , three at the most , and it would be done . The train stopped and its doors opened , releasing a gush of human effluent . When the outflow slowed to a trickle , the lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured inside , as though someone had hit the reverse switch on a giant vacuum . People kept jamming themselves in despite the warnings that " The doors are closing , " and the mass of commuters grew more swollen until we were all held firmly in place , with no need to grip the overhead handles because there was nowhere to fall . The doors shut , the car lurched forward , and we moved off . I exhaled slowly and rotated my head from side to side , hearing the bones crack in my neck , feeling the last remnants of nervousness drain away as we reached the final moments . It has always been this way for me . When I was a teenager , I lived for a while near a town that had a network of gorges cutting through it , and at some of them you could jump from the cliffs into deep swimming holes . You could see the older kids doing it all the time-it did n't look so far up . The first time I climbed to the top and looked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , and I froze . But the other kids were watching . And right then , I knew that no matter how afraid I was , no matter what might happen , I was going to jump , and some instinctive part of me shut down my awareness of everything except the simple , muscular action of running forward . I had no other perceptions , no awareness of any future beyond the taking of those brisk steps . I remember thinking that it did n't even matter if I died . Kawamura was standing in front of the door at one end of the car , about a meter from where I was positioned , his right hand holding one of the overhead bars . I needed to stay close now . The word I had gotten was that this had to look natural : my specialty , and the reason my services are always in demand . Harry had obtained Kawamura 's medical records from Jikei University Hospital , which showed that he had a condition called complete heart block and owed his continuing existence to a pacemaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back was to the doors-a slight breach of Tokyo 's minimal train etiquette , but I did n't want anyone who might speak English to see the kinds of prompts that were going to appear on the screen of the PDA computer I was carrying . I had downloaded a cardiac interrogation program into it , the kind a doctor uses to adjust a patient 's pacemaker . And I had rigged it so that the PDA fed infrared commands to the control magnet . The only difference between my setup and a cardiologist 's was that mine was miniaturized and wireless . That , and I had n't taken the Hippocratic oath . The PDA was already turned on and in sleep mode , so it powered up instantly . I glanced down at the screen . It was flashing " pacing parameters . " I hit the Enter key and the screen changed , giving me an option of " threshold testing " and " sensing testing . " I selected the former and was offered a range of parameters : rate , pulse width , amplitude . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate limit of forty beats per minute , then returned to the previous screen and selected pulse width . The screen indicated that the pacemaker was set to deliver current at durations of .48 milliseconds . I decreased the pulse width as far as it would go , then changed to amplitude . The unit was preset at 8.5 volts , and I started dropping it a half volt at a time . When I had taken it down two full volts , the screen flashed , " You have now decreased unit amplitude by two volts . Are you sure you want to continue to decrease unit amplitude ? " I entered , " Yes " and went on , repeating the sequence every time I took it down two volts . When the train pulled into Yoyogi Station , Kawamura stepped off . Was he getting off here ? That would be a problem : the unit 's infrared had limited range , and it would be a challenge to operate it and follow him closely at the same time . Damn , just a few more seconds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was only allowing the people behind him to leave the train , and stopped outside the doors . When the Yoyogi passengers had exited he got back on , followed closely by several people who had been waiting on the platform . The doors closed , and we moved off again . At two volts , the screen warned me that I was nearing minimum output values and it would be dangerous to further decrease output . I overrode the warning and took the unit down another half volt , glancing up at Kawamura as I did so . He had n't changed his position . When I reached a single volt and tried to go farther , the screen flashed , " Your command will set the unit at minimum output values . Are you certain that you wish to enter this command ? " I entered " Yes . " It prompted me one more time anyway : " You have programmed the unit to minimum output values . Please confirm . " Again I entered , " Yes . " There was a one-second delay , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unacceptable output values . I closed the cover , but left the PDA on . It would reset automatically . There was always the chance that the sequence had n't worked the first time around , and I wanted to be able to try again if I had to . There was n't any need . As the train pulled into Shinjuku Station and jerked to a stop , Kawamura stumbled against the woman next to him . The doors opened and the other passengers flowed out , but Kawamura remained , gripping one of the upright bars next to the door with his right hand and clutching his package of fruit with his left , commuters shoving past him . I watched him rotate counterclockwise until his back hit the wall next to the door . His mouth was open ; he looked slightly surprised . Then slowly , almost gently , he slid to the floor . I saw one of the passengers who had gotten on at Yoyogi stoop down to assist him . The man , a mid-forties Westerner , tall and thin enough to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wireless glasses , shook Kawamura 's shoulders , but Kawamura was past noticing the stranger 's efforts at succor . " Daijoubu desu ka ? " I asked , my left hand moving to support Kawamura 's back , feeling for the magnet . Is he all right ? I used Japanese because it was likely that the Westerner would n't understand it and our interaction would be kept to a minimum . " Wakaranai , " the stranger muttered . I do n't know . He patted Kawamura 's increasingly bluish cheeks and shook him again-a bit roughly , I thought . So he did speak some Japanese . It did n't matter . I pinched the edge of the magnet and pulled it free . Kawamura was done . I stepped past them onto the platform and the in-flow immediately began surging onto the train behind me . Glancing through the window nearest the door as I walked past , I was stunned to see the stranger going through Kawamura 's pockets . My first thought was that Kawamura was being robbed . I moved closer to the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers obscured my view . I had an urge to get back on , but that would have been stupid . Anyway , it was too late . The doors were already sliding shut . I saw them close and catch on something , maybe a handbag or a foot . They opened slightly and closed again . It was an apple , falling to the tracks as the train pulled away .
