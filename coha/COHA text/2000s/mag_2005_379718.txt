This is partly a story about a company called Apple Computer . It 's also partly a story about a fancy new iPod that plays videos as well as music and that could dramatically change the way people entertain themselves . But it 's mostly a story about new things and where they come from , about which there are a few popular misconceptions . <P> Stop and look at Apple for a second , since it 's an odd company . It has been around long enough and has a high enough profile that it 's easy to forget that . While most high-tech firms focus on one or two sectors , Apple does all of them at once . Apple makes its own hardware ( iBooks and iMacs ) , it makes the operating system that runs on that hardware ( Mac OS X ) , and it makes programs that run on that operating system ( iTunes , iMovie , Safari Web browser , etc . ) . It also makes the consumer-electronics devices that connect to all those things ( the rapidly multiplying iPod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnishes content to those devices ( iTunes Music Store ) . If you smooshed together Microsoft , Dell and Sony into one company , you would have something like the diversity of the Apple technological biosphere . <P> Why would anybody run a business like that ? If you follow conventional wisdom , Apple is doing it all wrong . Try to do everything at once , and you wo n't do anything well . Worse , the way Apple operates is not how you 're supposed to foster innovation , or not in the U.S. , anyway . Under the traditional , capitalist , Adam Smithian model , new and better things arise as a result of freedom and open competition , but Apple is essentially operating its own closed miniature techno-economy . What is this , Soviet Russia ? Why not license Mac OS X to Dell , see what hardware it comes up with and let the market decide whose ride is flyest ? Is Steve Jobs afraid of a little healthy wrasslin ' in the great American bazaar ? <P> And yet ... this is the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past 30 years : the Apple II , the Macintosh and the iPod . In the past six weeks alone , Apple has shipped three impressive new products : an ultra-tiny iPod called the nano , the video iPod and a nifty feature called Front Row that lets you run your computer from across the room , lying on a sofa , clicker in hand , without crouching over a keyboard . That is cool stuff . So , where does it all come from ? <P> Ask Apple CEO Steve Jobs about it , and he 'll tell you an instructive little story . Call it the Parable of the Concept Car . " Here 's what you find at a lot of companies , " he says , kicking back in a conference room at Apple 's gleaming white Silicon Valley headquarters , which looks something like a cross between an Ivy League university and an iPod . " You know how you see a show car , and it 's really cool , and then four years later you see the production car , and it sucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! They had it in the palm of their hands ! They grabbed defeat from the jaws of victory ! <P> " What happened was , the designers came up with this really great idea . Then they take it to the engineers , and the engineers go , ' Nah , we ca n't do that . That 's impossible . ' And so it gets a lot worse . Then they take it to the manufacturing people , and they go , ' We ca n't build that ! ' And it gets a lot worse . "
