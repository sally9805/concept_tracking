<p> In his four years as chairman of Augusta National , Hootie Johnson has revamped the qualifications for the Masters , eliminated the lifetime exemption for past champions and orchestrated massive redesigns of the golf course . <p> Each decision was accompanied by only a few words of explanation . <p> But when the head of a women 's group wrote to Johnson in June demanding that the club invite a female member , the 71-year-old chairman fired off a scathing , three-page statement to the media defending Augusta 's traditions and rights as a private club . <p> He has kept silent as Martha Burk of the National Council of Women 's Organizations has campaigned against sex discrimination at Augusta National . The Associated Press sat down with Johnson on Nov. 4 in his second-floor office , whose walls bear a photo of Johnson and former chairman Clifford Roberts and an original portrait of Bobby Jones painted by President Eisenhower : <p> HJ : There 's been so much speculation about when we are going to have a woman member at Augusta . And I thought we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no timetable on a woman member . And our club has enjoyed a camaraderie and a closeness that 's served us well for so long that it makes it difficult for us to consider change . As I 've said before , a woman may be a member of this club one day , but that is out in the future . And in the meantime , we will hold dear to our tradition and our constitutional right to choose and associate . <p> Q : Would you ever consider canceling the Masters ? <p> A : No . <p> Q : Under any circumstances ? <p> A : No . There will always be a Masters . <p> Q : Even if you felt this debate had reached a point that it was starting to tarnish the image of the Masters or the club ? <p> A : I do n't see that happening . The majority of Americans are with us on this issue . I want you to know that . <p> Q : How do you know that ? <p> A : I just know it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He points to a letter on the coffee table , with a Lancaster , Pa. , newspaper clipping of a poll . Of 624 people , 90 percent said Augusta should not have to admit a female . ) And I also know it because we 're right . You know , some of the media tries to portray us - or this woman portrays us - as being discriminatory , and being bigots . And we 're not . We 're a private club . And private organizations are good . The Boy Scouts . The Girl Scouts . Junior League . Sororities . Fraternities . Are these immoral ? But they 're trying to portray us as being discriminatory and being bigots . We will prevail because we 're right . <p> Q : One could make the argument that Augusta National is different than the Boys Scouts because it hosts a very public golf tournament , the crown jewel of golf , which generates a lot of money for the club . <p> A : No , the membership does not benefit from the tournament . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it away . <p> Q : Would Augusta National be what it is today without the Masters ? <p> A : I think they go hand-in-hand . The two complement each other . <p> Q : It seems like the relationship with Augusta and the Masters make it a very public staging . One of the questions raised is should a public tournament be held to ... <p> A : We should be penalized for presenting something that 's good for the game of golf ? Something that 150 million people watch around the world ? Something that 's a harbinger of spring ? Something that is respected worldwide , probably is one of the top , if not the top , sporting events ? ( Voice rising ) And we 're going to be penalized for presenting that ? <p> Q : How would you be penalized ? <p> A : By suggesting we 're going to lose our private-club status . <p> Q : You mention in your letter that Augusta was " strongly urged to radically change our membership . " What did you mean by radical ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A : Yes . It would be a big change . <p> Q : And yet you allow women to play the course regularly . <p> A : Sure . <p> Q : What 's the problem with having one as a member ? <p> A : Well , ( pause ) we just do n't choose to do that ( long pause ) at this time . <p> Q : Is there any chance we 'll see a female member by April ? <p> A : No . <p> Q : Can you say how close you were to having a woman member until this debate seemingly brought everything to a halt ? <p> A : I would say that this issue being raised has had nothing to do with whether we have a woman member or do n't have a woman member . <p> Q : Why send Dr. Burk a three-sentence letter , which is consistent with your discussions on club matters , but then issue three pages of a very terse and somewhat defiant statement to the media ? <p> A : She threatened us and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the public know how we felt about it . <p> Q : Do you have any regrets ? <p> A : I seldom have any regrets . I do n't look back much . I regret that she threatened us . And I regret that she threatened our sponsors . <p> Q : You also wrote that you wanted to avoid " backroom discussions . " In light of the way this has transpired , would backroom discussions have been better than having this splashed across headlines ? <p> A : If someone comes up to you and threatens you , or says that " I think I 'd like to move in with you , " what do you say ? " Let 's sit down and talk about it " ? <p> Q : Do you think the public 's perception of the Masters has changed because of this ? <p> A : No . I do n't think we 've been damaged , for the reasons I said . This woman said we 're discriminating and that we 're bigots . Most of the media has picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think one of the thoughts is that the Masters has become public property . <p> A : But we 're not . That 's one week . Fifty-one weeks of the year , we are a private club . And we do something good for one week , for the sporting world , and we 're going to be penalized ? <p> Q : You did say in April you had no exclusionary policies . But you also have n't had a woman here since 1933 . How does that square with the other ? <p> A : It squares that we have n't felt a need to invite one , or that we wanted to . <p> Q : That almost makes it sound like a woman has nothing to offer to the club . <p> A : You 're really trying to bait me now . Do you think girls have anything to offer the Boy Scouts ? Do men have anything to offer to the Junior League ? No . We 're a private club . We have a right to choose and associate with whom we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to have one as a member ? <p> A : I said we did n't choose to have one . <p> Q : You allow women to play thousands of rounds here . What would be the difference of having one as a member ? <p> A : Well , at the opening , I said that we enjoy our camaraderie that I guess men enjoy . And Bobby Jones ' kindred spirit . Do you understand those terms , as far as men being together ? <p> Q : Do you look at this more as a social club than a golf club ? <p> A : It 's a golf club . <p> Q : Do you think men and women can mix on a golf course ? <p> A : Sure . <p> Q : Can the camaraderie not exist ? <p> A : We have parties , four parties a year , and those are times that we have this camaraderie and this closeness . There are no guests . They are member parties . The members are together . <p> Q : You said you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . She threatened us . But I have n't felt threatened . <p> Q : What about Shoal Creek ? Why did you not have a black member until 1990 ? <p> A : Shoal Creek has got nothing to do with this . Nothing . <p> Q : Did you not have your first black member until ' 90 ? <p> A : Yes , but that has n't got anything to do ... Racial discrimination and gender are two different things . Do you know of any constitutional lawyer that 's ever said they were the same ? Do you know any civil rights activists that said it was the same ? Do you ? It 's not relevant . Nobody accepts them as being the same . <p> Q : How do you feel about comments from members who have ... <p> A : I 'm not going to talk about members . We 'll handle that internally . We do n't discuss member matters . <p> Q : Do you feel the club has put some of them in an awkward position ? <p> A : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your television sponsors that this might be a problem ? <p> A : No . We just decided to let them off the hook . <p> Q : How far are you prepared to go without a sponsor ? <p> A : We could go indefinitely . But I do n't think we 'll have to . They 'll be back . We 'll have our sponsors back . Some sponsors . <p> Q : What makes you say that ? <p> A : I just believe that we 're right on this issue , and that they 'll be comfortable in sponsoring the Masters Tournament . There will be sponsors that will be comfortable . <p> Q : Do you think they would have been uncomfortable now ? <p> A : Yes . Obviously , that 's why I let them go . <p> Q : Safe to assume you think this attention will go away ? <p> A : I think so . <p> Q : Any idea when ? <p> A : Smiles and shakes his head ( no ) . <p> Q : Did you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ) . <p> Q : Ever consider no television ? <p> A : No . We 'd like to bring the Masters to the 150 million people out there . Why would we want to think about not having television ? <p> Q : How many letters have you received ? <p> A : ( He points to four files on his desk , all bulging with letters . ) I do n't know . What would you say that is , 400 or 500 ? <p> Q : Any negative ? <p> A : A few . <p> Q : Do you read them all ? <p> A : I read them all . They ( club employees ) fax them or send them to me . <p> Q : Do you respond ? <p> A : Every one . <p> Q : Pro or con ? <p> A : No , we do n't respond to the cons . <p> Q : Has anything Martha Burk said made any sense to you as a businessman or civic leader ? <p> A : I really have n't paid much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : What has annoyed you the most ? <p> A : I have n't been annoyed . That 's not true . You 'll have to let me off on that . Well , this whole issue annoys me . One of the things that disappointed me most is the press has not been fair in so many ways . I know some of you people know us . But when she throws out " bigotry " and " discriminatory " ... if we 're discriminating , then all those other single-gender organizations are discriminating . And they 're not . It 's a terrible thing if they 're accused of that also . <p> Q : Do you expect to see pickets outside the gates in April ? <p> A : I predicted that some time back . <p> Q : How will you deal with that ? What would you think about protests or pickets ? <p> A : Well , our patrons are ladies and gentlemen , and they 'll ignore any protesters that may be there . <p> Q : Do you care what anyone thinks about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be perceived as a good organization . And the fact we present the Masters Tournament speaks very well . We do something good . And Bob Jones , he represented integrity and honesty and fairness and doing the right thing . We try to hope that it 's symbolic of our club and the Masters Tournament . <p> Q : Are you concerned about presentation of this tournament when the focus will be on this issue come April ? Makes you wonder if anyone will realize Tiger is going for three in a row ? <p> A : A lot of that depends on you folks , whether you want to focus on an issue that really is not relevant after a while . It 's not relevant . But we wo n't be focusing on it . <p> Q : Your record as a business leader and civic leader , how much you 've done to promote civil rights . Do you fear people will forget that ? When people think Hootie Johnson , do you think they 'll see him as a chairman who said no to women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have any worry about that . We 're doing the right thing now . I 'm comfortable with the way I 've lived my life for the most part . That does n't mean I have n't made mistakes . <p> Q : How do you suppose Clifford Roberts would have tackled this ? <p> A : I 'd like to think that he and Bobby Jones would have approved with what we are doing . <p> Q : Does Augusta speak with one voice ? <p> A : That 's a membership matter . I do n't care to answer that . <p> Q. Maybe my questions are because I 'm on the outside of the club in the midst of a debate , and you are on the inside and not affected in the least by this . You sit down with a chairman who does n't look any different than when he was talking about course changes in March . You do n't feel this is a problem , this attack on the club ? <p> A : I think we 'll prevail - that we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we 'll prevail . <p> Q : What 's unfortunate about it ? <p> A : That we have this hassle . That ... let 's just let it go at that . <p> Q : Do you think many would be surprised to see a chairman whose name has been used and abused over the last four months , who does n't look like he 's lost a lot of sleep over it ? <p> A : Well , I probably have lost some sleep . Really , the most offensive thing is somebody calling me an " old coot . " <p> Q : Do you not like the " old " or the " coot ? " <p> A : Both . ( Laughing . ) <p> Q : Do you think this has tarnished the Masters ? <p> A : No.
