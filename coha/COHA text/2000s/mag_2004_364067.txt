There 's a joke in the accounting trade that the difference between a wobbly grocery cart and a corporate auditor is that the cart has a mind of its own . Very funny , unless you had invested in MCI ( formerly WorldCom ) , which recently announced that the pretax income it reported for 2000 and 2001 was just a tad off  --  $74.4 billion less than it had said , after writedowns and adjustments . Outside auditors have signed off on bogus earnings reports and balance sheets at companies from Rite Aid to Xerox . In some cases , auditors dealt with corporate brass intent on concealing thievery ; WorldCom 's ex-CFO , Scott Sullivan , recently pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges , for instance . In other cases , auditors simply lacked spine : again and again , they failed to police the books aggressively for fear of losing the client , along with consulting gigs that brought in higher profits than standard audit work . <P> The tables have turned . Strengthened and emboldened by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act , which overhauled accounting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloves and snapped on rubber ones . With their federally issued mandate to look for trouble , accountants no longer have to take a company 's word that its audit policies are legit . The accountants have the power to challenge corporate ledgers with impunity  --  and they 're raking in money doing so . " Auditors and audit committees are now in the catbird seat , " says Harvard Business School professor Jay Lorsch . Companies no longer feel free to dump their auditors , for fear of sparking a public spat ; no one wants to spook jittery investors , provoke shareholder lawsuits or another regulatory crackdown . " There 's more respect for the auditor , " says Julie Lindy , editor of Bowman 's Accounting Report . " Companies no longer think the audit process is about creating the illusion that they 're jumping through hoops . " <P> The change in the relationship is largely because of Sarbanes-Oxley , known in the trade as Sox or Sarbox . The 2002 law stiffens accountants ' spines in part because it places them under a new federal watchdog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency , the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board , also has an industry moniker  --  Peek-a-Boo  --  and recently issued a stricter set of rules detailing how auditors should evaluate internal controls . Companies must test these controls regularly , and such tests must be conducted by a firm different from the company 's outside auditor , to avoid conflicts of interest . The agency 's chairman , former New York Federal Reserve Bank chief William McDonough , is close to finalizing joint supervision rules with the European Union  --  welcome news to U.S. investors after the collapse of Parmalat , the Italian firm that had concealed $18 billion in debt .
