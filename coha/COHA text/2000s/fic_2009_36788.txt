Northern California , sixteen years later <p> Savanah Gentry stared at the stage , her eyes narrowed as she studied the magician who strutted back and forth . This time , he was billed as Santoro the Magnificent . He wore his long black hair pulled away from his face and his attire was a little different , but she knew he was the same man she had seen on a number of other occasions under a variety of names . Clad in a pair of tight black trousers , a white muscle shirt that clung to his upper body like a second skin , and a pair of knee-high black leather boots , he was the most handsome man Savanah had ever seen . She had seen him at least a dozen times in the last sixteen years , thanks to her father 's fascination with magicians . <p> She had to admit that she was also intrigued by the art of magic and by those who practiced it , even though she knew none of it was real , and that the amazing effects performed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience , misdirection , deception , or sleight of hand . She knew David Copperfield had n't really made the Statue of Liberty disappear , but she had been amazed by the video just the same . <p> Of course , magic was a two-way street , with the magician attempting to perform a trick that was so incredibly clever it would completely baffle the audience , while the audience let itself be entertained by an effect they knew was accomplished through deception . <p> William Gentry 's passion for magic , illusion , and the Supernatural bordered on obsession , surpassing even his daughter 's interest . He seemed especially obsessed with the man now calling himself Santoro the Magnificent , and had , in fact , compiled a notebook that spanned the magician 's career over the last sixteen years . Of course , finding the magician through the years had been hit and miss , since he continually changed his name . And now Renaldo or Zander or Antoine or whoever he was , was in Kelton again , albeit under yet a different name . <p> Savanah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . Sitting in the front row , she could n't decide if the " Magnificent " in Santoro 's title referred to his remarkable abilities as a magician , his arrestingly handsome face , or his incredible physique . Most likely all three . <p> She had to admit that , aside from his astonishing good looks and his hard , lean body , he was far and away the best prestidigitator she had ever seen , and she had seen many . Santoro the Magnificent did n't do anything as ordinary as sawing a woman in half or making an elephant disappear , although Savanah was pretty sure he could manage both feats with ease . No , he stood on a bare , well-lit stage and performed the impossible . She had seen him step into an open box on the left side of the stage and , seconds later , step out of a similar box on the right side . He had caught a bullet , fired by the local chief of police , in his bare hand . He had levitated a full-grown horse into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor , and while hanging suspended in midair , had invited everyone in the audience who was so inclined to come up and see for themselves that there were no invisible wires holding him up . Savanah had accepted that invitation and left the stage more convinced than ever that he was the real deal , a true magician . A recent article in a neighboring newspaper suggested that Santoro the Magnificent had sold his soul to the devil in order to obtain his remarkable powers . She could n't help wondering if that also accounted for his devilish good looks . <p> One of the highlights of the magician 's act occurred when he stood in the spotlight at the front of the stage and vanished from sight , only to reappear moments later in the rear balcony of the theater . She had seen similar gags performed before , but always there had been a trick involved-some sort of sleight of hand or a stunt double , because it was virtually impossible for a man to teleport himself from one place to another in a matter of seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Choo suede boots-boots that she had scrimped and saved for-to know Santoro 's secret . If it was a trick-and what else could it be ? - it was the best one she had ever seen . She remembered standing on the very stage he was on now , close enough to touch him , when she was nine years old . Remembered watching him open an ordinary-looking door , step through the opening , and disappear . To this day , she was convinced he had dropped into a cleverly hidden trapdoor . After all , people did n't just vanish into thin air . <p> Santoro 's most astonishing feat occurred when he transformed into a wolf in full view of the audience . Smoke and mirrors , some said , but Savanah was sure it was more than that . Mere illusion , others said , and she might have agreed if she had n't seen him perform , up close and personal , on several occasions . There were rumors that he was a Werewolf , but she had dismissed the idea , since she had seen him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Savanah recalled seeing him perform on her fourteenth birthday . He had been billing himself as The Marvelous Marvello at the time . Once again , he had called her out of the audience . Was it mere chance that he had picked her , or did he remember her as she remembered him ? He had bid her watch closely as two men tied his hands and feet with thick rope and then bound him with golden chains . Once again , he had disappeared before her eyes , leaving the ropes and chains behind . <p> The last time she had seen him , he had been calling himself the Great Zander , but she had known it was him the minute he 'd walked onto the stage . Hardly daring to blink , she had watched his every move closely , hoping to catch him using sleight of hand or a device of some kind as he performed one amazing trick after another , convinced once again that he was either the greatest magician since Harry Houdini , or a wizard gifted with Supernatural powers . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santoro had again called her out of the audience . He had taken her hand in his and kissed her palm , sending little frissons of electricity shooting up her arm . He had felt it , too , she was sure of it , though he had given no sign of it . Even-voiced , he had asked her if she was afraid of heights and then explained that he was going to levitate her . She had expected him to put her into some kind of trance or hook her up to an invisible wire while he distracted the audience ; instead , he had looked into her eyes and then , to her utter astonishment , he had lifted his hand and she had risen vertically into the air . She had hung there for what seemed like an eternity , with his gaze locked on hers , before he slowly lowered his hand until her feet again touched the floor . Before she 'd left the stage , his gaze had caught and held hers . In that brief moment , she had found herself wondering again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her amazement , she realized that he had n't changed at all . He looked exactly the way he had when she had first seen him sixteen years ago . Why had n't she ever noticed that before ? <p> Now , as he finished his act , she applauded as wildly as the rest of the audience . Perhaps he really was a wizard . Perhaps he was a magician in league with the devil , but whatever he was , he was the most amazing showman she had ever seen . <p> In his dressing room , Rane Cordova removed the trappings of Santoro the Magnificent and slipped into a pair of well-worn jeans and a bulky black sweater . The crowd had been with him tonight , eager to suspend belief and be entertained . Another two weeks , and he 'd move on to another theater in another town . It was an easy life , and one that suited him perfectly . In the winter , he did an eight o'clock show during the week , shows at six and nine on Saturday nights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer , he cut the six o'clock shows . Matinees were out of the question at any time of the year . <p> He ran a comb through his hair , thinking , as he did so , of the woman he had called on stage that evening . He wondered if it was coincidence that she had been in the audience again , not only in this city , but in others . He had seen the recognition in her eyes when she 'd stepped onto the stage , knew she remembered him from times past . The hell of it was , he remembered her , too . She had been a cute kid sixteen years ago . <p> She was n't a kid any longer , but a beautiful young woman with hair the color of moonlight . Long and thick , it fell in waves down her back and over her shoulders . Her eyes were a soft shade of blue , reminding him of the noonday sky he had n't seen in over ninety years . Her skin was smooth and clear , what used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He swore under his breath . Her lips were full and pink , the kind of mouth that made a man think about cool sheets , long nights , and hot skin . <p> Rane frowned as he turned out the lights . There was something about her that was vaguely familiar . He shook his head . She reminded him of someone he had met long ago . <p> Grabbing his keys , he left the theater by the back door , quickly blending into the shadows . He sensed the woman waiting for him in the alley , but he passed her by without her ever being the wiser . <p> In the old days , he had looked forward to talking with his fans . He had answered their questions , signed autographs , and posed for pictures that , when developed , would show only a white haze where his likeness should have been . Oddly enough , in this age of digital cameras and cell phones , his image appeared on the screen , but once the camera or cell phone was turned off , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that peculiarity to his advantage by letting it be known that he was superstitious about having his picture taken . At the beginning of each show , he asked that no photographs be taken , adding that any pictures captured without his permission would vanish from cell phones and cameras . People had been skeptical at first , but when they discovered it was true , the fact that he apparently made his photographs disappear only added to his mystique . <p> He could n't explain his inability to be photographed any more than he could explain why he cast no reflection in a mirror . It was just a fact of life , one he had learned to accept long ago , as he had learned to accept so many things that were part of his bizarre lifestyle , not the least of which was his eternal thirst for blood . He had tried to ignore the craving , tried to satisfy it with the blood of beasts , or with blood stolen from hospitals and blood banks , but to no avail . The blood of beasts could sustain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no satisfaction . Sooner or later , the need for fresh blood drawn from human prey became overwhelming . <p> It had always been so easy for his brother , Rafe . Rane remembered their first hunt , remembered the woman their father had chosen , the way she had felt in his arms , the enticing beat of her heart , the intoxicating scent of her blood . He had wanted to drink and drink until there was nothing left . <p> " We 're not going to kill her , " their father had said , and Rafe had dutifully obeyed . Rane had complied , as well . What other choice had he had with his father standing there , watching ? <p> But later , when Rafe and his parents were occupied elsewhere , Rane had left the house . He had found a young woman plying her trade on a dark street where nice people did n't go , and he had taken her . Oh , he had given her pleasure first-she had deserved that much-but in the end , he had taken what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her memories , her life . <p> Taken it all , and reveled in the taking . <p> And in so doing , had damned himself for all eternity . <p> Savanah huddled deeper into her jacket , wondering if Santoro the Magnificent had somehow managed to slip past her in the dark . Of course , being a master magician , she supposed he could have just turned into a bird and flown away . She had lost track of the number of times she had seen his act . Each time , his tricks had been more amazing , more spectacular , than the last . Each time , her curiosity about his prowess had grown . He was no ordinary magician . Of that she was certain . But if his tricks were n't tricks , what were they , and how on Earth did he do them ? She did n't believe for a minute that he had sold his soul to Satan , and yet ... it made for interesting speculation . She had read countless stories of men and women who had made deals with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for power or wealth . But they were just fables . At least , she had always thought so , until now . <p> She waited another half an hour before giving up . He would n't elude her tomorrow night . One way or another , she was determined to talk to him . Not only was she eager to satisfy her own curiosity about the man , but she was slated to write an article about him for the local paper . In addition to that , she hoped to include him in a book she was thinking of writing about famous magicians , past and present , magicians like Houdini , David Copperfield , and Criss Angel . <p> Turning up the collar of her coat , she returned to the parking lot for her car and drove home . <p> When she entered the living room , she found her father sitting in his favorite easy chair watching a high-stakes poker game on the satellite screen . <p> " Hi , sweetie , " he said . " How was the show ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she hung it in the hall closet , then kissed her dad on the cheek before dropping down on the sofa and kicking off her shoes . <p> " Did you get to interview him ? " William Gentry asked . <p> " No , I did n't see him . " She hated to admit defeat , especially since her father was the one who had given her the assignment . If necessary , she would just write the article without the interview . <p> Her father chuckled softly . " Seems like he 's a hard one to catch . Are you going to try again ? " <p> " Sure , if you want me to , but honestly , Dad , I do n't know why you 're so determined about this . The man is a great magician , but it 's not like he 's a rock star or anything . I mean , how many people even know who he is ? " <p> " If it 's too hard for you , just let it go . " <p> Savanah 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So , you 'll try again ? " <p> " Of course , and I 'll get him . You just wait and see . " <p> " I do n't doubt it for a minute . It 'll make a good story . " <p> " I hope so . " <p> For the last five years , her father had been the editor-in-chief of the local newspaper . Before that , he had been an investigative reporter , one of the best in the country . He had blown the whistle on high-level government officials and small-town gangsters alike . He had brought down drug lords and pimps and put an end to a group of scumbags who had been selling crystal meth to high school kids . Once , he had spent several months in jail because he had refused to give up a snitch . He had been honest and fearless , never turning away from a story , no matter how gritty it might be , never backing down when the going got tough . <p> Although he was now the editor-in-chief and no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story , and she knew it was something big because he refused to talk to her about it . <p> Savanah wanted to be just like him ; however , being just a rookie , she had n't yet been assigned to any big stories . Of course , in a small town like Kelton , there were n't too many big stories to begin with , but once she had gained some experience , she hoped to move to New York , Chicago , or Los Angeles . <p> Savanah smiled at her father . Though he was still a relatively young man , his hair was tinged with gray . Lines of pain were deeply etched around his mouth and eyes . He rarely smiled . Savanah could n't blame him . Eighteen years ago , her mother had passed away from a mysterious illness . Savanah had been seven at the time . She remembered very little about her mother except that she 'd had an infectious laugh , made the world 's best chocolate chip cookies , and loved to dance . <p> Seventeen months ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit-and-run accident that had cost him the use of both legs and left him confined to a wheelchair . He had spent several months in the hospital . The driver had never been found . For a time , Savanah had feared that her father would never recover , and then , one night , on the spur of the moment , she had bundled him into the car and headed for the next town to see a new magician . To her surprise , it had been the man now billing himself as Santoro the Magnificent . Miraculously , her father had regained his old zest for living . He had gone back to work , and bought a special van to get around in . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
