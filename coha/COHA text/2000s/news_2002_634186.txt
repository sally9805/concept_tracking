<p> In the hallway of his Marina Del Rey high-rise , Elton Brand looks like a giant . But he 's struggling mightily . In his left hand , he is carrying 10 hangers ' worth of dry cleaning . A dozen more are in his right . A FedEx envelope is clenched between his teeth . He also is holding two travel bags , a pair of shoes and house keys while trying to unlock his front door . A light sweat beads on his forehead . He bobbles the keys and nearly spits out the FedEx . There goes a travel bag . Those hands , the ones that overlap Shaq 's , are about to fail him . But then he gathers himself , just like he does before he takes it up strong . His long , slender fingers carefully guide the key into the lock , and he pops open the door . Almost in one motion , he swoops to the back bedroom and unloads his burden on the bed . A minute later , he 's stretched out on his black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a backboard , watching Cribs " on MTV . Just like that , peace reigns . <p> His rest , though , is short-lived . Corey Maggette pops up from two floors down to borrow Brand 's vacuum cleaner . But that 's just a front ; Maggette 's really got his eye on Brand 's 500-plus DVDs on the bookcase . <p> I 'm just gon na grab a couple , " Maggette says . <p> But Brand insists that he first bring back the ones he already has borrowed . <p> " You got like seven or eight already , " Brand says , getting up to position his body between Maggette and the bookcase . That 's how they end up missing . " <p> Each time Maggette reaches for a movie , Brand brushes his hand away . <p> " Come on , just let me borrow Robocop 2 , " ' he pleads . <p> Brand laughs and says , " Your card has been denied . " <p> The phone rings , and Brand goes into the back room to answer it . Maggette snatches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and takes off . Kids . <p> But Brand is used to it . The Clippers , the second-youngest team in the NBA , have gone to him for everything from DVDs to big shots all season . All of 23 on March 11  --  eight months older than Maggette and Lamar Odom , 13 months older than Quentin Richardson  --  Brand is the reliable hand of this talented but inexperienced bunch . He emerged as a leader four games into his first season with the team when Odom was suspended for violating the NBA 's drug policy . He became the go-to guy soon after . And now , with a roster resembling a hospital ward and a schedule from hell , Brand has put the Clippers on his broad shoulders and kept them in contention for their first playoff berth in five seasons . <p> Not bad for a player who was traded for a high schooler and slotted to be no more than a third option with his new team . But proving people wrong is nothing new . <p> " Been that way forever , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Critics downgraded his two seasons of double-doubles with the Bulls , insisting they were cheap stats on a bad team . If the Bulls disagreed , they certainly did n't think the No. 1 overall pick in 1999 was their franchise player , either . But Brand 's performance this season has been impossible to discount . And if the 6-8 power forward can will his hobbled Clippers into the postseason in the brutal Western Conference , even his staunchest critics finally will be silenced . So who cares if he loses a couple of DVDs along the way ? <p> *** <p> Lay your eyes on him , and you 're not blown away . His body is a collection of leftover parts that do n't quite fit together . Size-16 feet are connected to his mammoth body by rather spindly legs . A magazine once tried to run a life-sized picture of his hands , but they would n't fit on the pages . And who knows how he ended up with a 7-footer 's wingspan ( 89 inches ) . His broad shoulders make him look shorter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispers that the Wooden Award winner was really 6-6 . A reverse layup in practice looks like an experiment , and his game is neither fluid nor pretty . <p> But rare is the player whose motor runs harder . Brand refuses to be dominated by taller players and controls the boards by sheer will , often fighting for the ball well after the whistle . At any given time , there 's a minor flesh wound on his upper body . And under the boards , he can show a mean streak you did n't know he had . <p> Scout Brand , and this is what you get : Nothing flashy , just automatic . He 's averaging a team-high 18.4 points on 52 percent shooting . Make him miss , and chances are he 'll get it back . He 's leading the league in offensive rebounds ( 4.7 ) for the second time in his three-year career and is fourth in overall rebounds ( 11.8 ) . <p> " His game is so old-school , " says Maggette , who , along with fellow new-schooler Richardson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open the perimeter . <p> Most important , where the Clippers could n't close out tight games last season , now they can . <p> " Elton is responsible for that , " coach Alvin Gentry says . <p> On Jan. 23 against the Los Angeles Lakers , he blocked a three-point try by Rick Fox with 25.3 seconds left that would have tied the score in a 95-90 victory . In New York , he blocked two shots with less than a minute left , sealing a 112-110 victory against the Knicks . Late in a four-point road victory against the San Antonio Spurs , he followed two jump hooks over Tim Duncan with a tip-in to close the deal . <p> " We have a lot more confidence with him on the floor , " point guard Jeff McInnis says . <p> It 's easy to brand him as a typical Duke guy : serious , businesslike , politically correct . Yeah , he is those things , but he can work both sides of the street . He can do the PlayStation thing with the boys or talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money in stocks and big-cap funds and has financial interest in Our Own Clothing , which finances Sean John and Kevin Garnett 's OBF line . <p> His previous ties with the Clippers have served him well . He and Odom were teammates on an AAU squad that went 64-1 when they were high school sophomores . Brand knew Richardson from DePaul while he was in Chi-Town , and he and Maggette were Duke teammates for a season . Before the season , his teammates voted him tri-captain . During Odom 's eight-game suspension , Brand made sure he stayed in the loop by sending him two-way messages and popping over to play video games . <p> Hang around Brand for 15 minutes , and you run the risk of becoming the butt of one of his jokes . His teammates rank him just behind Keyon Dooling as the Clippers ' ace funnyman . An hour after practice , Brand leaves the Clippers ' training facility . There are two cars left in the lot : a plain black 2001 Suburban and a rusted-out , late- ' 70s Oldsmobile with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door handle on the Olds . <p> " This is me right here , dog , " he says . <p> After a few seconds , he busts out laughing , half at you for falling for it , half at his own humor . <p> His wardrobe is a smart mix of corporate sensibility and hip-hop cool . He 's not on the flash level of teammates Richardson and Darius Miles , but he can relate . His first season in Chicago , he splurged on a couple of top-of-the-line Mercedes-Benzes and platinum jewelry . <p> " I never had money before , so I went crazy , " Brand says . <p> He thought it was all about 20-inch rims and being seen , but he quickly learned it 's hard to be fly on a 16-game losing streak . The glitz was n't him , so he sold the cars and the jewelry . <p> " For a profit , " he says . <p> *** <p> Brand pulls his plain Suburban into a parking space in front of Aunt Kissy 's Back Porch in Marina Del @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had in Sacramento . He tugs at his 4X sweat pants and sits down . His knees pop up higher than the table . He then digs in to three large chicken breasts , red beans and rice , stuffing and lemonade . The conversation turns to the Bulls , and Brand winces . <p> " It feels like it was so long ago , " he says . <p> He stopped watching SportsCenter " because the anchors ripped the Bulls so relentlessly . He averaged 20.1 points and 10 rebounds his first season and shared Rookie of the Year honors with Steve Francis , but the Bulls won only 17 games  --  20 fewer than he had won his last season at Duke  --  and he was embarrassed . <p> " We would walk into a gym , and teams would n't even play their stars , " he says . " It was awful . " <p> At the All-Star break last season , the Bulls were riding a 16-game losing streak and had a 6-42 record with no solution on the horizon . <p> " I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Brand , who started telling teammates he wanted out . <p> They thought it was the losing talking . It was n't . Another 20/10 season was n't silencing the doubters . So when his agent called two weeks before the draft to tell him he would be traded to the Clippers for the No. 2 pick , he was ecstatic . <p> " Coming here was another chance to prove myself , " he says . " It was the perfect situation for me . " <p> *** <p> It 's early February , and Brand is in the Peekskill High gym , 30 minutes north of Manhattan . Two thousand people are packed into a gym that seats half that many to witness the retiring of Brand 's jersey . They had laughed at the 6-3 freshman when he went out for basketball  --  until he dunked the first day of practice . A year later , they were state champs . They had doubted him when he signed on with a Duke recruiting class that included Shane Battier and Chris Burgess . Two seasons later , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We hope you continue to inspire all of us to live better lives , " says the keynote speaker , New York Gov . George Pataki , a Peekskill alum who has known Brand since Brand was 4 . <p> Just a few days earlier , Brand had been left off the Western Conference All-Star team despite being second in the league in double-doubles . He was wounded by the snub , then went out and proved his point with 10 rebounds after he was named to replace Shaq four days before the game . <p> That 's how the season has gone . Every time the Clippers get knocked down , Brand picks them back up . When a seven-game road trip right before the break threatened to sink the Clippers ' playoff chances , Brand went 23/10 in a victory against the Dallas Mavericks , 19/14 in a victory against the Spurs , then 17/14 against the Knicks , helping the Clippers to a 3-4 trip . Odom missed all of February with a sprained wrist and ankle , and injuries have sidelined Maggette and Michael Olowokandi . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back-to-back 20/20s , to keep the Clippers within sight of the eighth and final playoff spot in the West . <p> *** <p> It 's just after midnight at trendy Dublin 's on Sunset Boulevard , and Brand and his agent , David Falk , stand off to the side of a crowded dance floor . Both have their hands in their pockets  --  Falk as stiff as a board , Brand as loose as change . Brand 's got a slow head bob going . He 's informed that the lowly Denver Nuggets just beat the Lakers by 16 points . His head stops bobbing , and he starts with the questions . What did Shaq do ? How did the Nuggets score their points ? Do you think the Lakers could lose two in a row ? The Clippers will play the Lakers in 18 hours , and he looks worried . The next 10 minutes , he does n't say a word . <p> " I got ta get outta here , " he finally says . " Big game tomorrow . " <p> As he stands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring the Suburban around , two tricked-out Mercedes-Benzes catch his eye . <p> " I had those exact two Benzes right there , " he says . " Rims and everything . " <p> He pauses , trying to hide a half-smile , then shakes his head slowly . <p> " What a jerk . " <p> For Brand , some losses are easier to take than others . <p> Reprinted with permission from ESPN The Magazine .
