OWNERS REPORT Headnote You just got ta love It . And owners do . // Every decade or so , along comes a gotta-have-it car . The original Mustang , when it first arrived in March 1964 , was a gotta-have-it car . Today it 's Chrysler 's PT Cruiser . As with Ford 's early Mustang , Chrysler 's plan is to keep the PT Cruiser 's sticker low and make money on the options . As production still lags behind demand , there 's a steady frenzy for Cruisers that allows Chrysler to build and sell fully loaded cars . Still , the majority come with an automatic instead of the standard five-speed . Many also have the Quick Order Package , which carries the Limited Edition badge and includes such amenities as leather-and-suede bucket seats with a power height adjuster on the driver 's side , fold-flat front passenger 's seat , power sunroof , remote keyless entry , central locking , alarm , side-impact airbags , overhead console with compass , cruise control , and several lesser items to the tune of about 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatic , are ABS with four-wheel discs and traction control , and a luggage rack . In our survey , the average price paid was $19,890 . Obviously , not all Cruisers came fully loaded , because we heard plenty of gripes about dealers tacking on $2000 to $3000 over invoice . One respondent reported paying a $9000 premium . And , the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reportedly paid $10,000 over book for two early Cruisers that they used for crash testing . Photograph Photograph Photograph // Some government agencies classify the PT Cruiser as a truck , others label it a car . Chrysler calls it a sport wagon , and at the moment there 's only one body style and one level of trim available . The Cruiser is loosely based on the Neon platform , yet it 's 5.6 in. shorter than a Neon , 7 in. taller and boasts an interior volume of nearly 120 cu . ft . That 's roughly six times as much space as there is in the trunk of a new Cadillac DeVille . The Cruiser 's versatile body style comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat , tumble or roll out , and a rigid plastic rear shelf that can be set up as a table , divider , privacy screen , seat-extending shelf or simply laid flat on the floor . All doors open wide and tall , and the seating stance is higher than in most sedans . Standard equipment , even in the base Cruiser , ineludes air conditioning , power windows , power steering , tilt wheel , center console with storage , AM/FM/cassette sound system with CD changer controls , rear wiper , cloth front buckets and a split , folding , removable rear bench , 12-volt power outlet , front and rear stabilizer bars and 15-in. wheels . There are two optional Touring groups available , both with 16-in. alloy wheels and tighter suspension tuning . Only one engine is offered in the Cruiser : the Neon 's DOHC 16-valve 150-hp 2.4-liter Four . Over a third of our survey respondents felt that , for a vehicle weighing 3200 pounds , this engine lacks adequate power , especially with the automatic transmission and air conditioning . And full-throttle acceleration causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turbocharger or making a V6 available . Rumor has it that Chrysler is considering both . Otherwise , drivers complained of poor vision out the right rear . The Cruiser was praised for its level of comfort , but some owners could n't figure out why the driver 's seat has an inboard armrest and the passenger 's does n't . We also heard a few grumbles about the location of the power-window switches . The two switches for the front windows are in the upper center stack , while those for the rear windows are at the back of the console , near the floor . But , acclaim and compliments outweighed criticisms by a huge margin . Many owners told us how much they enjoy their Cruisers and what a wonderful job DaimlerChrysler has done in bringing such a truly different and notable concept car to market . Rarely do we process an Owners Report that 's so enthusiastic about a new automobile . For More On Automobiles Check the Automotive channel on the PM.Zone Web site at **25;2074;TOOLONG EDITORS REPORT More Than Another Cute Face In an effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really is , we put about 5000 miles in behind the wheel of one . Having done that , we can tell you in no uncertain terms that this thing is versatile . It seems you can do about a million different things with the seats to vary the ratio of passengers to cargo . With the seats out or folded down , we managed to fit a new big-screen TV in there , still in the box . With all the seats in place , there is room for five adults , although the guy in the middle of the rear seat wo n't be too happy . Unfortunately , the PT Cruiser is bog slow off the line . And that does get annoying at times , like when you 're trying to hustle through traffic . You have to anticipate your moves way in advance , especially when you 're hauling a Cruiser full of people . Once up to highway speed , the car has adequate power . Passing on two-lanes is tricky and takes lots of advance planning . A fix is said to be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine with about 50 more horsepower . We 'll see . Meanwhile , PT Cruisers are still in short supply and there 's a line for them at your Chrysler dealer . As such , the car still causes a commotion wherever it goes . There are times when simply pulling into a parking lot nearly causes a riot . So obviously , despite its practicality , the PT Cruiser is not for the shy and retiring .
