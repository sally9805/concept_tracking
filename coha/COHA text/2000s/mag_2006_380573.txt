Was I wrong to support the war in Iraq ? Several conservatives and neoconservatives have begun to renounce the decision to topple Saddam Hussein three years ago . William F. Buckley Jr. , as close to a conservative icon as America has , recently wrote that " one ca n't doubt that the American objective in Iraq has failed . " George F. Will has been a moderate skeptic throughout . Neoconservative scholar Francis Fukuyama has just produced a book renouncing his previous support . The specter of Iraq teetering closer to civil war and disintegration has forced a reckoning . <P> In retrospect , neoconservatives ( and I fully include myself ) made three huge errors . The first was to overestimate the competence of government , especially in very tricky areas like WMD intelligence . The shock of 9/11 provoked an overestimation of the risks we faced . And our fear forced errors into a deeply fallible system . When doubts were raised , they were far too swiftly dismissed . The result was the WMD intelligence debacle , something that did far more damage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed . <P> Fukuyama 's sharpest insight here is how the miraculously peaceful end of the cold war lulled many of us into overconfidence about the inevitability of democratic change , and its ease . We got cocky . We should have known better . The second error was narcissism . America 's power blinded many of us to the resentments that hegemony always provokes . Those resentments are often as deep among our global friends as among our enemies  --  and make alliances as hard as they are important . That is not to say we should never act unilaterally . Sometimes the right thing to do will spawn backlash , and we should do it anyway . But that makes it all the more imperative that when we do go out on a limb , we get things right . In those instances , we need to make our margin of error as small as humanly possible . Too many in the Bush Administration , alas , did the opposite . They sent far too few troops , were reckless in postinvasion planning and turned a deaf ear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their abdication of the moral high ground , by allowing the abuse and torture of military detainees , is repellent . Their incompetence and misjudgments might be forgiven . Their arrogance and obstinacy remain inexcusable . <P> The final error was not taking culture seriously enough . There is a large discrepancy between neoconservatism 's skepticism of government 's ability to change culture at home and its naivet when it comes to complex , tribal , sectarian cultures abroad .
