She 's All That Regarding the increase in violence by women ( " Bad Girls , " December 1999 ) , it is my sense that women are not becoming more violent , it is that they are getting away with less . This trend will continue as our culture moves closer to sexual equality and the same lens is used for looking at the behavior of both men and women . Our current bifurcated approach to behavior reflects a tendency to look at the male through the lens of free will , and the female through the lens of determinism . When women are scrutinized through the free-will lens , the picture that emerges may not be very pleasin . Francis E. Kent via e-mail In his article " Bad Girls " ( December 1999 ) , Barry Yeoman explored the rising rates of female violence and the possible causes of that violence . However , I found his discussion on violence at home rather disturbing . Although Yeoman qualifies his statement that " women can be just as ferocious as men " in the home by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , I still felt like he trivialized the sex difference in violence toward loved ones . Numerous studies have shown that while the rates of domestic violence perpetrated by men and women may be equal , women primarily use violence as self-defense against men who are abusing them . It is interesting and important to study why . women have become more violent in recent years . But in making that argument it is also important not to overlook the fact that violence in personal relationships is still very influenced by gender . Brenan L. Smith Grinnell , Iowa They Think , Therefore They Are Thank heavens you had some riposte in your December issue to Clive Wynne ( " Do Animals Think ? " ) . I had thought we had long since passed the primitive stage of drawing clear-cut lines between humans and other species . Surely it is accepted by now that we are simply another species that forms part of the animal kingdom ? Yes , it 's interesting to do investigations into what kind of consciousness different animals have , especially those that plainly show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has spent time in close association with a range of animals knows , without experiments , that every species has a kind of consciousness that is unique and special to them . So let 's not get it wrong with animals simply because we have n't yet got a clear idea of what animal consciousness is ! Mandi Smallborne Gauteng , South Africa Not Only the Strong Survive I am forced to disagree vehemently with the far-fetched conclusions on " teasing " attributed to Dacher Keltner , Ph.D . ( " The Art ( and Science ) of the Tease , " December 1999 ) , who somehow distorts teasing into " an indispensable social tool , vital to all healthy relationships . " One can only conclude that Dr. Keltner must have been an athletic , attractive , outgoing , thoroughly social child , because those are the only sort who escape vicious abuse . As for " when the powerful pick on the weaker , the power differential obscures all the play in teasing , " perhaps Dr. Keltner should consider that no " play " is intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abusing the weak . I believe it was the great historian Will Durant who said , " History may be defined as the rape of the weak by the strong . " Allowing for metaphorical use of the word " rape , " this phenomenon is observable in anv junior high school . David M. Shea Four Lakes , Washington Credit Is Due In " Celebrity Meltdown " from your December issue , you indicate that Tipper Gore " ... has fought to raise awareness for sufferers by coordinating the first-ever White House Conference on Mental Illness . " This is not the first time someone quite close to the White House has been very involved with mental health issues . In 1977 Rosalynn Carter helped establish the President 's Commission on Mental Health . As a 57-year-old recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder , I found Ms. Carter 's book , Helping Someone With Mental Illness , to be very informative and helpful . I hope your magazine will find some opportunity to credit this fine lady for her efforts on behalf of people suffering from mental illness . Larry Kohn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September/October 1999 issue , Editor-in-Chief Robert Epstein interviewed both Tipper Gore and Rosalynn Carter about their valiant efforts in the field of mental health . What About Drugs ? I enjoyed the December 1999 issue of PT . But I was startled that the invention of Prozac ( and its cousins ) was not highlighted as one of the pioneering breakthroughs of our century . The " rise of brain science and pharmacology " was alluded to in the cover story 's lead paragraph , but unless I missed it , was never given its proper due in the bullet-pointed breakthroughs of our time . Was it ever considered , or simply overlooked ? I can kind of understand why the mass media reviews of the century/millennium have overlooked pharmacology , but frankly I was surprised that PT would . I was looking forward to it getting its due . Prozac and Lithium have revolutionized my life . Photograph // Also , I thought PT would have highlighted it because it has clearly changed the way the business of psychology is being done-with talk therapy increasingly partnering with pharmacology , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in a fascinating era . Let 's talk about it ! Dwight Okita Chicago , Illinois Get Off Our Backs We are writing to express surprise and disappointment in your response to Dan R. in the December column ( " Ask Dr. E " ) . He writes asking your opinion of the statement " Homosexuality is no longer to be considered an illness but rather a normal human condition . " You give the standard explanation , but then add , " But since the Bible strictly forbids it , many people are bound to view it as deviant or evil . " We were surprised that you presented such a one-sided opinion of what the Bible states . There are many very learned biblical scholars who in fact do not believe the Bible clearly forbids homosexuality . Your statement has such an authoritative ring to it , that we believe it adds weight to the position you put forth . it made us wonder if in fact that was your position . In a " scientific " journal , we think one should be very careful about presenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to refer to the Bible ( which we do n't believe was necessary to answer the question ) , a response that presented both interpretations would have been much more fair and accurate . As psychology professionals who are concerned about the violence and hatred so rampant in our society against homosexuals , we feel it is very important to take every opportunity to present valid information that fosters acceptance and tolerance . Karen A. Stewart , M.A. David Stewart , Ph.D . via e-mail I am writing in response to your question and answer colurnn in the December issue . I am appalled by your ( literally ) antediluvian attitudes toward sexual diversity . Do you often refer to the Bible in your professional diagnostic opinions ? If so , do you then advocate stoning adulterers ? Homosexuality was removed from the DSM , except for the category of ego-dystonic homosexuality , after many courageous gay and lesbian psychologists risked your homophobia by coming out of the closet . They demonstrated , through their research and their own lives , that homosexual people are mentally healthy , fully functioning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental disorders than any other group of people . The only thing that makes homosexuality a " difficult lifestyle " is people , and psychologists , like you . Dossie Easton Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist via e-mail Dr Robert Epstein responds : You may have overlooked my assertion that homosexuality appears to be a " normal human condition " hardly the homophohic view . My statement about the Bible is an observation , not an endorsement . The Bible@position on homosexuality is unequivocally negative . Ifyou doubt that , read Romans 1:26-27 and Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 . As a society , we often choose to set aside the Bible @ rules , especially in matters of semiality . This may happen with homosexuality , but until it does , the lifestyle will remain a difficult one . Give Peace a Chance Your editorial , " Season of Peace , " ( December 1999 ) reminded me of why PSYCHOLOGY ToDAY has not attracted me in a while . The approach to this extremely important subject does not rise above poppsychology . The answers given to why there are wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex , psychological insecurity , bad luck . Actually , contrary to the editorial , humanity has already developed a care for warfare , and it does not reside in any of the above . It is suggested by the fact that no liberal democracies have waged war on each other for the past 180 years . Furthermore , when liberal democracies go to war with other kinds of societies , it is usually with extreme reluctance , as we saw in the lead-up to World War II or in last year 's dealing with the vicious aggression of Serbia . Why this astonishing pacifism of liberal democracies ? R-J . Rummel , who first drew attention to this back in 1983 , suggests it has to do with the pervasive freedoms of these societies ; freedom of the individual to express dissenting opinions and to form or join associations such as political parties and interest groups . Rummel found in a statistical study of all interstate wars since 1816 that the more freedom there is in a society , the less violence there is internally and the less conflict externally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even less given to violence internally or externally than those merely with political freedoms , he discovered ( i.e. , the more " capitalistic " they are , the more peaceful ) . Another way of maling the point is to observe that unlike authoritarian or totalitarian states , which pretend that there is uniformity in their societies and which do not have open and affirmative ways of dealing with dissent , liberal democracies have the politicization of conflict built into their essential structures , so that diverse interests are constantly being brought into the open , dissent is emphasized and constructively dealt with , and accommodations are reached before conflict of interests becomes overt violence . " Peace Studies " is mostly pursued by left-wingers and those favoring state-run social interventions . Perhaps , then , it is not surprising that despite Rummel 's publication of these extremely significant findings back in the early ' ' 80s , there have not only been next to no follow-up studies or even attempts at " refutation , " but also that his publications on this are not even cited in peace research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to leave the herd , however , I recommend R.J. Rummel , " The Freedom Factor , " ( Reason , July 1983 ) . Dr. Evan M. Zuesse via e-mail More Sex , Less Illness In her article " Beyond Orgasmatron " ( December 1999 ) , Barbara Keesling suggests that enhanced sexual experience might promote physical health . There is evidence of that being the case . During the past several years researchers investigated the hypothesis that the act of sexual intercourse is associated with increased risk of heart attack . They found that persons so engaged are at twice the risk of heart attack , but that the risk of heart attack at any moment is so small that the increased risk was not significant . They did , however , discover that sexual activity may be an inoculation against heart disease . Of the 1,200 people in the study ( each of whom had had a heart attack ) , more than half had not had sex in the year previous to the heart attack . This is much higher than the approximately 20% of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the previous year . What is curious to me is that the medical research establishment has not investigated this relationship to any degree . Is it our strangely puritanical and prurient attitude toward sex ? Albert O.
