Michael Milken may have lost his bid for a presidential pardon , but some familiar wheeler-dealers that he either funded or fought in his heyday as Wall Street 's junk-bond king have resurfaced , let back in the game by a receding stock market . And they aim to play . The names include Carl Icahn , Henry Silverman , Ted Forstmann , Irwin Jacobs and Henry Kravis  --  an ' 80s reprise that almost makes you want to cue the Ramones and slam dance . <P> We 're not on the verge of a greedfest like the reckless ' 80s , a period that youngsters may be surprised to learn was far more rapacious than anything served up during the Internet bubble . But change is in the air , and the wolves have their noses up . Last week Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan cut interest rates for the second time in less than a month . The rate cuts make it cheaper to borrow , a must in almost all buyouts that are n't stock swaps . <P> Just as important , the stock market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more affordable . For the same reason , companies that use only stock for acquisitions have had that currency devalued . This leaves the raiders to rule , and they 're suddenly finding they have renewed access to a crucial financing source  --  junk bonds . That well went dry as investors funneled their money into stocks in recent years . Junk-bond mutual funds suffered net outflows of $10 billion last year . But since Jan. 1 , junk funds have had net inflows of $3 billion , according to AMG Data , bringing them to an aggregate total of $87 billion . <P> Odyssey Investment Partners and First Reserve Corp. , a pair of buyout firms , were among the earliest to tap this replenished reservoir to finance a takeover . Last week they agreed to buy Dresser Equipment from oil-services giant Halliburton for $1.6 billion . More of that ca n't be far behind . <P> Already , unsolicited bids  --  the preferred ' 80s raider weapon  --  are on the rise . The value of these bids more than doubled last year , to $5 billion , reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a household name with its $25 billion takeover of RJR Nabisco in 1989 , is in the process of raising $6 billion , its largest pool ever for deals . <P> Of course , a few key ' 80s players never went away . Bottom fisher Sanford Weill , for one , amassed an impressive array of financial companies on the cheap while others were getting tech-obsessed . He is now the head of Citigroup , one of the world 's largest banks . Icahn , the ' 80s raider who shook Texaco and took TWA , has asserted influence in small doses throughout the ' 90s by buying large amounts of distressed corporate debt , as has former Milken colleague Leon Black at Apollo Advisors . <P> Icahn , though , has clearly stepped up his pace , pushing Nabisco Holdings into the arms of Philip Morris and briefly rattling mighty GM 's cage with a large stock purchase last year . Now he 's thrusting himself into the middle of American Airlines ' plans to buy TWA  --  long after he sold his controlling interest in the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
