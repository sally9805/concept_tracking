The video library at the new IGFA Fishing Hall of Fame and Museum allows visitors to relive angling historylike Tommy Gifford 's early exploits . By Peter Wright // IN 1986 WE WERE fishing one of the last giant tuna tournaments to be held in the Bahamas . Although the tuna were not biting well , we wound up winning on Raptor with Ralph Mongeau 's 615-pound bluefin . One evening , we watched movies from the International Game Fishing Association 's film library-films donated by anglers , many of them copied onto videotape . The first film was shot in the early 1950s and had wonderful action shots , including footage taken from a small airplane that showed huge schools of tuna crossing the shallow flats south of Cat Cay and peeling off to strike baits behind what the narrator called state-ofthe-art " fishing cruisers . " It was a film about legendary fishing guide Tommy Gifford , however , that really got us excited . I met Gifford several times when I was a teenager . I was most impressed by what a crusty old so-and-so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wish I had seen the movie before I met him . One way or another , I would have pestered him into letting me hang around , or maybe even ride along with him for a while . Marlin were already being caught in the Pacific by pioneering Australians , New Zealanders and Hawaiians . The Avalon Tuna Club was already a going concern , with many striped marlin catches ; and Zane Grey was making expeditions to the islands of the South Pacific that have not been matched even with today 's motherships . Ernest Hemingway advised Gifford of commercial marlin fishing techniques used in Cuba ( later immortalized in The Old Man and the Sea ) , and Mike Lerner ( owner of the Lerner stores and a founder-and major financial backer-of the fledgling IGFA ) chartered Gifford in 1934 to try for a blue marlin off Bimini . Gifford and Lerner decided to give these big cousins of sailfish a try . The movie footage is superb even by today 's standards . Greyhounding marlin with a recognizable but unspoiled Bimini in the background drew applause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a life jacket as he prepared to wire a good-sized blue marlin that Lerner had alongside the boat , cries of surprise and sarcastic comments came from the audience . Then Gifford " billed " the marlin like a sailfish . Derision turned into cheers of approval . They echoed through the warm Bahamas night as Gifford proceeded to bill a series of marlin ranging up to almost 500 pounds ! There were no gaffs-just a short , nuggety young man who never let go once he had hold of the bill . " What a stud ! I do n't believe it and I 'm seeing it ! " was the gist of the shouted reactions as Gifford was shaken like a rao doll but never once relinquished his grip . It is still one of the most awesome fishing movies I have ever seen . State-of-the-art I had been impressed by the IGFA Hall of Fame and Museum when I attended its opening , but I only recently had a chance to check out the library , with its video viewing and reading rooms . - Mike , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and look at the old books when the IGFA was in Pompano . Is the library in the new Museum open to the public ? " I asked IGFA President Mike Leech at a chance meeting . " You mean you have n't been in yet ? " was his astonished reply . Two days later I drove down and was floored by what I found . Leech introduced me to head librarian Gail Morchower , who showed me through the state-of-the-art facility that will see a lot more of me in the near future . First we entered a rare-book room containing first editions ( all of Zane Grey 's works , for starters ) and original albums and logs donated by pioneering anglers . The humidity- and temperature-controlled room is a fishing history researcher 's nirvana . The books can be viewed and read but not removed from the library . There are two video viewing rooms with comfortable seating . The more than 1,500 videos include copies of the two early movies mentioned above . As fast as they come in , you would have trouble keeping up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library of older periodicals , as well as over 12,000 books . You can find books , videos and magazines from a computer list of titles , authors and subject . It took Morchower only about 30 seconds to tell me the year of the video I had seen in Bimini 13 years earlier . I watched it again and it was still as impressive . The IGFA itself can be defined by the goals it has set for the new library/museum complex : Tell the story and celebrate the history of the sport ; pay tribute to its pioneers and heroes ; boost fishing as an activity ; establish angling ethics and promote fishery conservation . This last mission-keeping stocks plentifulis ultimately the most important , and the IGFA attempts to lead the way by encouraging both catch- and-release and tag-and-release and by lobbying for the protection of fishing grounds from commercial exploitation .
