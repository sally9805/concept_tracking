<p> Roy Chapman could not understand it . In the days before the Kentucky Derby , the owner of Smarty Jones watched on television and read in the newspapers as one racing handicapper after another predicted that his undefeated colt had little chance of winning America 's greatest horse race . <p> " I do n't think this horse has ever got the respect he 's due , I really do n't , " Chapman said . " I 'm not going to mention names . I watched one handicapper , I 'm not sure he even mentioned Smarty 's name , to tell you the truth . Another handicapper said he 's a good horse but he 's not really going to beat anybody . " <p> None of six featured handicappers in The Daily Racing Form  --  horse racing 's Bible  --  had Smarty Jones among their top four picks . The New York Times was only slightly less guilty , selecting Smarty Jones to run third behind Lion Heart and Read the Footnotes . <p> If there was a common denominator in the lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pedigree . Casual racing fans may decide which horse they like simply based on whether he has been winning or losing , but handicappers and devoted fans look further . They turn to the horse 's family tree , checking out the dam and sire  --  the mother and father  --  and the grandparents and the great-grandparents , and even the great-great grandparents , too , as they look for evidence that a horse has " classic " bloodlines that will allow him to run long as well as fast , that will propel him to finish first at the daunting mile and a quarter distance of the Derby . <p> One of the Daily Racing Form handicappers , Dave Litfin , had settled on Smarty Jones as his Derby winner after watching the colt 's impressive victory in the Arkansas Derby . But when the moment of truth arrived to make his selections , he predicted that the classically bred Tapit would run off with the roses and he left Smarty Jones off his list . <p> " He was a Pennsylvania-bred who had not run in a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No trainer or jockey had won the Derby on their first try in 25 years , which was something John Servis and Stewart Elliott were trying to do . " And , Litfin said , he figured " some horse would jump up with his illustrious pedigree and run him down . " <p> In the end , no classically bred colt did challenge Smarty Jones and for the sixth time in eight years a horse thought to be suspect because of breeding ended up in the winner 's circle at Churchill Downs . In addition , for the third time in as many years , the winning horse was not born in Kentucky , which prides itself on being the place where champion horses are born and made . That fact has unnerved breeders in Kentucky and turned one of the industry 's not very scientific truths on its head . No one is certain anymore what " breed the best to the best and hope for the best " means . <p> " The fact that Smarty Jones is not a Kentucky-bred is important because it shows again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once were , " said Jim Squires , who bred the 2001 Derby winner , Monarchos , on his Two Bucks Farm in Versailles , Ky . <p> While the Commonwealth of Kentucky has been the breeding ground for 97 of the 130 Derby winners , the more recent results have shown that Derby winners can be born far from the state 's limestone-enriched bluegrass . Incentive-based breeding programs in states like New York  --  where 2003 winner Funny Cide was bred  --  and Pennsylvania have aided this shift . <p> Elusive Quality , the sire of Smarty Jones , actually has his home in Kentucky . Still , Smarty Jones is considered a Pennsylvania-bred because he was born on Chapman 's Someday Farm in Chester County . He was registered with the state 's breeding program , which offers a 20 percent bonus to breeders on the purse money the horse subsequently earns by finishing first , second or third in races at Pennsylvania tracks . <p> Kentucky , however , does not have such a program . As a result , more breeders are shipping mares into the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New York and other states to drop their foals . The number of New York mares has increased from 2,029 in 1994 to 3,296 in 2003 . <p> But wherever the horse happens to be born , it is the bloodlines that ring loudest . Among the most recent Derby winners with classic breeding were the 2000 victor , Fusaichi Pegasus , and 2002 's War Emblem . Fusaichi Pegasus was the son of the late Mr. Prospector , one of the most successful sires of the modern era and a horse whose runners have earned more than $81 million in purses . Fusaichi Pegasus was so highly regarded that he fetched $4 million at a sale for yearlings and was later bought by Irish breeders as a stallion for a reported $60 million . <p> War Emblem was a grandson of Mr. Prospector , and the late Prince Ahmed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia purchased 90 percent of him in the weeks before the Derby for $900,000 . He was subsequently sold to Japanese breeders for $17 million . <p> Mr. Prospector is Smarty Jones 's great-grandfather on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as far as it goes , but not enough to make Smarty Jones 's breeding resonate among horse racing 's inner circle . <p> Here 's why : Smarty Jones 's sire , Elusive Quality , set a world record for a mile race on the grass , and a track record for a seven-furlong race on the dirt at Gulfstream Park in Florida . Neither are long , classical distances . Elusive Quality is also a young sire , whose track record is still developing . He has already produced 14 stakes winners , but the average winning distance for his offspring is 6.2 furlongs , or a little over three-quarters of a mile , according to Bloodstock Research Information Services . <p> And while the mother of Smarty Jones , I 'll Get Along , won 12 times in 39 starts , she is also the daughter of a sprint champion named Smile , whose offsprings ' winning average distance is 6.4 furlongs . <p> For handicappers and others , that would suggest that Smarty Jones would certainly have the capability to run fast but also might run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer . So far , that has not proven true . <p> And there is another knock against Smarty Jones : his size . " He is not big and the industry loves big , " said Squires , who added that every year horses like Smarty Jones are overlooked " because the distance is n't there , or the pedigrees are weak or they are small . " <p> For the betting public , however , Smarty Jones jumped off the page and he went to the starting gate at the Derby as the 4-1 favorite . While the experts wrestled with the mysteries of pedigree , the casual fan perhaps recognized that the colt was undefeated and were taken with the small-time-to-big-time story of his owners , jockey and trainer . <p> Some might have simply liked his catchy name . And some might have realized that the rain on Derby Day would only help a front-running horse like Smarty Jones , because horses positioned in the rear would get mud kicked in their face . In fact , the Racing Form handicappers who guessed wrong on the Derby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weather would be . Had they known it would rain hard , they might not have ignored Smarty Jones . <p> In any case , with the Preakness eight days away , it is unlikely the experts will overlook Smarty Jones again . He already has accomplished what no horse since the 1977 Triple Crown winner , Seattle Slew , had : come into the Derby without a loss and leave the same way . <p> But there are also bound to be some nonbelievers . There is a racetrack adage for beaten handicappers  --  " Why go to the funeral when you skipped the wedding ? "  --  that warns against jumping on the bandwagon when trying to divine something as unpredictable as a horse race . <p> " I 'll probably pick him to win the Preakness , " said Litfin of Smarty Jones . " But if he wins , I might take a shot at beating him in the Belmont . " <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com The New York-bred Funny Cide 's victory in last year 's Derby also contradicted conventional wisdom . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
