Music 's Joyful Noise If you 're walking around Jackson Square around 8 p.m. , you may notice the open doors of The Saint Louis Cathedral with voices in song pouring forth . Nearly every night between December 1 and 23 , you 'll find a free concert here . You 're welcome to wander in ( casual clothes are fine ) and sit awhile . I happened upon a gospel concert and enjoyed the juxtaposition of loud , lively music in the serene , aged church . Out in the square on Sunday evening , December 22 , get a song sheet and a candle , and join Caroling in Jackson Square , a 56-year-old tradition that is free and open to the public . Eats and Treats New Orleans always celebrates life with great food . But during this season , it 's a citywide feast with reveillon menus . This ritual comes from kitchens of the 1800s , when families made Christmas Eve and New Year 's Eve special around their tables . Now , almost 30 restaurants offer-in addition to their regular menus-a prix fixe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person . Out of the many places serving these dinners , we especially like Arnaud 's , Upperline , and Palace Cafe , whose sweet ending fills a mini gingerbread cottage with pumpkin mousse . Almost every afternoon at 3 , you can watch one of the Big Easy 's chefs prepare a favorite recipe at Le Petit Theatre du Vieux Carre on the corner of Jackson Square . Demonstrations are free . ( Arrive early ; latecomers are n't admitted. ) &gt; If you 're traveling with little ones and want a fancy experience , take them to a Nutcracker-style tea at The Ritz-Canton on Saturdays , November 30 through December 21 , between 11:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m .

The lobby stretches an entire city block , and during the holidays it becomes a nostalgic wonderland of wispy clouds , glittering ornaments , lights , Christmas trees , gingerbread houses , and more . For a calmer and more retrospective look at the city 's holiday decorations , tour several homes from centuries past in the French Quarter . Both the Gallier House Museum and the Hermann  --  Grima House point out the surprising fact that long ago Christmas Eve and Day were minor , quiet family holidays with small gifts . It was New Year 's Eve and Day that were celebrated with big presents and lots of visitors . Gentlemen brought ladies paper cornucopias filled with candy and nuts , which the women then left strewn on the parlor table so subsequent visitors could note their previous callers . At the Beauregard-Keyes House , stories of its earlier inhabitants fascinate more than the decor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived here for 18 months , and novelist Frances Parkinson Keyes spent winters writing here for 25 years . This is another good stop for shopping . The gift store carries many of her books , which are hard to find .
