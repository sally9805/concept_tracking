The Reverend thought it through . The Reverend made up his mind . The results Well , surely no one anticipated this <p> THE GOBLIN WAS VERY FOND of oatmeal cookies , but he absolutely doted on shortbread . Therefore , in keeping with the oft-taught moral lesson that we only value what we do not easily obtain , the Reverend James Eldred never served his guest shortbread except on occasions of signal importance or festivity . At times it struck him as peculiar that the goblin did not-could not know that in the waking world of nigh twenty-one centuries since the Passion of Our Lord shortbread was no great treat , but altogether common . However , this was an idle reflection , useless , as impractical as using the fitful light of a firefly 's tail for a reading lamp . He was a very practical man , the Reverend James Eldred . A waxing moon hung low in the sky , swelling slowly to the full with creamy golden light . It rode the garden wall , bruising its belly against the fieldstones . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one hand resting on the frame , the other holding a bone china plate bearing a dozen wedges of shortbread . The night air was sweet with pine , chill with the first frosts of autumn . Soon it would be Halloween , as grownups reckoned time . Upstairs in her bed , the Reverend Eldred 's daughter Molly lay tumbled unwilling into sleep . Her last drowsy words to her father had been a long complaint about how dreadfully time stretched out between this night and the last one in October and how she had determined that on that haunt-harrowed eve he must bring her showers of diamonds and tribute of pearls by the handful , for she meant to appear before him as a princess . The Reverend Eldred sighed , the rising warmth of his breath etching a fingernail paring of fog along the bottom curve of his rimless glasses . Whether she stole the guise of princess or ragpicker 's child to extort candy from the neighbors , Molly herself was a handful . Dutifully he recited a prayer of grace , thanking the Lord for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housekeeper to help him bear up under the demands of single fatherhood . Matters had been different in the days when there was a Mrs. Eldred . The running of all things touching the house and garden and daily life for those within had seemingly been the work of elves , so invisible were the hustling domestic cogs that drove them . The Reverend Eldred found himself free to set his mind on higher things than the plumber 's bill or the baby 's first steps or how to cook the Sunday chicken . While his wife still lived , he had been one of the few men in this chromed and caustic modern day and age to speak of his helpmate and mean it . In fact it had been his charming trait of clinging to bygone usages and mores that had attracted the late Mrs. Eldred to her spouse in the first place . The gentler manners of other times floated in the air about him , settled over his shoulders with the comfortable languor of a blue worsted shawl . He was a man made for harmless pedantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been this same antique allure - compounded of oiled woodwork , pipe tobacco , old books and velvet-covered chairs - that had attracted the goblin to him as well . A log tumbled forward on the hearth , striking gouts of sparks against the andirons . The old case clock on the mantelpiece told the hour in ten tinny chimes . Light from the hall glowed in a harlequinade of jeweled colors through the lozenges of stained glass set into the panel above the doorway , red and green and blue and gold . The squat brown teapot on the table exhaled a fragrant ghost of bergamot over the eggshell-white cloth with its fringe of crocheted lacework . The Reverend Eldred turned from the window to set the plate of shortbread down among the tea things , then settled himself into one of the twin wingback chairs before the fire . " I hope he wo n't keep me waiting long , " he said aloud . " The tea will get cold . " It was a magical spell of great power , and it worked like - well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The goblin stood on the windowsill , cap in hand . Long , green , knob-jointed fingers worked the tweed brim into a clothy mush , claws the color of aged ivory fraying the thick fabric . A nose as warty and as bulbous as a gourd overhung wide , drooping lips that all but obscured the minimal excuse for a chin . The creature sprang from the sill , landing on broad , splaytoed feet and bandy legs of wonderful elasticity . The sum of him - from grimy , untrimmed toenails like weathered fence planks to pointed , tuft-tipped ears- was short enough to have walked into the heart of the Reverend Eldred 's fireplace without disturbing a single particle of soot from the bricks above . The Reverend Eldred gave his guest an amiable smile of welcome . " Good evening , " he said . " Lovely weather , is n't it ? " " Good enough for them as cares for weather , " the goblin replied . He shuffled across the carpet and clambered into the empty chair , feet straight out before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for deciphering the history of dirt . " Never had much use for it myself . Too tricksy . " He stuffed his cap down the back of his trousers ragged brown beltless things , his only other article of dress - and linked his hands together over a stomach like a basketball . " Have a piece of shortbread , " said the Reverend Eldred . The goblin 's joy was almost pitiful to see . Dull green eyes lit up as if illuminated from within , shining with the same dumb , half-doubtful elation of those who disbelieve they merit any happiness . His claws scraped complaint from the glazed surface of the serving plate , but to his credit he only took one piece of shortbread at a time . One by one he placed them well within the chasm of his mouth , closing lips and eyes in ecstasy over each fresh ingestion . He never seemed to chew them , but rather let them melt into oblivion . For the Reverend Eldred it was all too reminiscent of the proper manner for receiving the consecrated Host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Shortbread had no place in his notions of Communion . When the goblin had eaten the last of the shortbread he eyed the empty platter wistfully , but said nothing . In all the time since he had first begun his visits , he had never once requested either food or drink , though he had never once turned down any food or drink the Reverend Eldred might happen to offer either . If the goblin found shortbread more to his taste than lemon squares , he communicated this fact purely by the act of clearing the plate of the former and only nibbling fastidiously at one of the latter , for manners " sake . It was on the basis of essay and observation alone that the clergyman came to learn his visitor 's preferences . " That were good , " the goblin said , smacking his lips . He washed down the last few crumbs with a healthy slurp of tea , two sugars . " Yes , that were passing good . " " There 's more , " said the Reverend Eldred . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I 'll make us a fresh pot of tea as well . " The goblin 's face blossomed with delight at the promise of more shortbread . " Why , that 'd be fine , sir , fine as silk , " t would be . " He let cup and saucer clink back down onto the tabletop and worked his sloping shoulders more deeply into the soft upholstery of the wingback chair . " Nothing like a bit o " edifying conversation of an autumn evening , I always say . " And having said that , he said no more , but waited politely for his host to propose some topic of mutual interest for discussion . " I want you to steal my daughter , " said the Reverend Eldred . If the goblin had been drinking tea at that moment , the damage to rugs and clothes and even distant draperies would have been unspeakable . A tealess splutter was followed by a rising roar of astonishment that made the windows rattle in their casements , thus : " Whaaaaat ? " " Sshhhhh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly from his chair to the door of his study . He stood there , head cocked , listening while the old case clock on the mantel laboriously shook out tick on tick on tick . Satisfied with the relative silence , the Reverend Eldred relaxed and grinned . " It 's all right , " he said . " You did n't wake her . Thank heaven for the thick walls in these old houses . " He returned to his chair . The goblin twiddled his thumbs and looked embarrassed by his recent outburst . " S'ry , " he muttered . Then in a slightly louder voice : " You were having a joke with me there , eh ? A good one it was . " His smile had the hideous beauty of a bulldog pup . " I 've never been as serious about anything in my life , " the Reverend Eldred said , and the goblin 's smile crumpled away . Before the poor baffled creature could gather breath to speak again , his host continued : " I promise you , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an idle fancy . I 'm not the kind of man who drops rocks from a bridge to see how high the water will splash . I 've thought this through . My daughter 's name is Molly . She is four years old . She 's asleep upstairs in the bedroom at the east end of the hall , in a white bed under a yellow flowered quilt , with a stuffed panda bear in her arms . It would be a kindness if you 'd take the panda too , for her sake . " " Oh sir , you ca n't be serious ! " the goblin cried . " Why , doin " such is - is - well , it 's clear unthinkable , that 's what . " " Very well , I wo n't insist : You do n't have to take the panda , " said the Reverend Eldred . " Bother the panda ! " said the goblin with some vehemence . " It 's your girl I mean . Steal her ? What for ? " " For my sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For hers . For her ultimate benefit and salvation . " The goblin 's brows tangled themselves into a Gordian knot , a scowl to leave a gargoyle 's grimace looking like little more than an ingenue 's simper . " Sir , " he said , " how long 's it been since I 've first had the pleasure of your compny ? " The Reverend Eldred steepled his fingers and thought hard on the matter before replying : " A trifle short of two years . It was at this same time of the year , more or less , that we met . " He forbore from mentioning the circumstances ; they had been painful for them both . " So , just so . And we 've conducted ourselves passin " charitable on both sides since , eh ? All kindness and good fellowship between us , to my way o " reckoning . " The man of God allowed that this was an accurate assessment of the situation . " Please , do n't pussyfoot around your point , old friend , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your spirit , say so straight out . " " Particularly troubling , is it ? " The goblin met the reverend 's Jovian calm with enough fluster and squawk for a dozen fox-plagued henhouses . " Man , where 's the stuffing in your skull ? This is your daughter you 're asking me to steal , your flesh , blood , bone and bile ! It 's not as if you 're inviting me to help myself to more shortbread . " A sly twinkle showed itself in the goblin 's slit-pupiled eye . " There is more shortbread ? " He was not above looking after his own minor interests , even in the midst of this to-do . " My friend , take her and take with her as many sweets as you fancy , " the Reverend Eldred assured him . " The lordship of my pantry shall be yours , we can call it fair pay for fair labor . But take her . " The goblin crossed his bulb-elbowed arms across his chest and frowned still more deeply , to the point where his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his face . " Not until you tell me why . " The Reverend Eldred sighed and fetched the newspaper . " What shall I read you first ? " he asked . " Tales of other lands ? They 've turned their skies to fire there , their fields to ashes . Children wander in the waste with empty bellies swollen and eyes no longer seeking any hope but death . Would you care to view the photographs ? We are very good about cataloguing such things . Or would you rather that I read you a romance ? Here 's one about a mother of three little ones who lost her first mate but found new happiness with another man . A charming story of love renewed , if it ended there . Unfortunately this fellow did n't seem to care for a woman whose attention could not be wholly his , and so , to hold his heart , she stilled her children 's while they slept . Oh , and here 's a tale of gallantry ! A man who sees to keeping ladies safely withindoors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's taught a hard lesson to six contrary females who would believe they could come and go as they liked , at all hours . " He folded over the page and exclaimed , " Aha ! A moral lesson for your edification , my friend , with illustrations : A photograph of a dog whose mistress hired bodyguards to watch over her beloved pet . They claim the diamonds on the creature 's collar are worth nearly fifty thousand dollars of her husband 's money . The photo and the story sprawl across the better part of this page . Yet here 's a half-buried squib about a homeless woman sleeping on a subway grate , set alight by persons unknown like a scarecrow after harvest . No one 's come forward to say who might have used a human soul for kindling . The police offer a telephone number for information , but no reward . A shame about the old woman , but an example for us all : If she 'd only applied herself with the proper diligence , by this day 's standards , she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goblin sat still as the stones his bones were made of , hearing the Reverend Eldred read on , telling out the tally of the world 's catastrophes , the scattered obscenities of a society where poison might freely flow out over land and water so long as money flowed as freely , into certain hands ; where families shattered , quarreling over dead men 's gold ; where children saw their parents sink away from them , into the grasp of pretty white powders , and tried to escape the pit themselves by building a ladder out of other children 's lives ; where people died for crying mercy of a god they called by a different name than that approved of by their neighbors . Sorrow by sorrow , horror by horror , he brought the goblin to see things his way . The poor , unhappy creature sat sobbing into its hands , milky tears bleaching the color from any scrap of fabric that they touched . " Oh sir ! " the goblin cried . " I 've gone beyond my station sure enough , questioning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Say no more , for " pon my honor , I 'll whisk the child as far as far can be from this worrisome world as you please . " He pushed himself from the wing chair and leaped to the windowsill . Jamming his cap down hard over his pebble-skinned skull he decreed , " She 'll be gone by dawning ! " And with that , he was gone as well . The Reverend Eldred took a deep breath , then rose from his chair , a man content . He gathered up the tea things onto a burnished toleware tray and conveyed them to the kitchen where he scrupulously washed and put away every piece , down to the tiniest teaspoon . This small domestic task accomplished , for fear of his housekeeper 's wrath , he returned to the study and granted himself the blessing of a pipe of brandied shag . It was as he sat knocking out the dottle of a second pipeful that he became of aware of small feet upon the stairway and the sound of a hand lightly scratching little claws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , " he said , and almost said my dear as well before sharp understanding bridled his tongue : Molly would knock , not scratch , if she chose to announce herself at all . The changeling child stood in the doorway , a white flannel nightgown grazing its knees . Its face was Molly 's face gone hard and sharp and browner by many shades , and the human girl 's blue eyes were muddled to a smudgy gray . It moved forward at a clipped and measured pace , heels knocking hollow against bare floor and carpet alike , until it came to stand before the Reverend Eldred 's chair , hands clasped behind its back , a cheated landlord 's charity in its eyes . The Reverend Eldred met the creature 's gaze somewhat charity , but soon regained his self-command . " So she 's gone ? " the man of God asked the changeling child , for he knew the ways in which these matters worked . No vanishment could be absolute : A substitute was necessity become tradition . " Some time since , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered . Its voice was harsh and raspy , dry as the chalky powder that falls when a child rubs oyster shells together by the sea . The housekeeper would dose this Molly-thing with bottles of patent cough mixture in vain . " What are my duties ? " It tilted its head at him owl-fashion . " For starters , knock at doors when you want to be let in . Do n't scratch . We are n't beasts under this roof . " " We are n't beasts , " the changeling child repeated , and the three words blew away to nothingness because they had no true meaning to hold them to the world . " Er , yes . " The Reverend Eldred 's fingers clenched more closely " round the carven face on his pipe bowl , the mask of some unnamed woodland grotesque from the German forests . He felt the ball of one fingertip press hard enough against the monster 's eye to leave its imprint on his flesh . " Yes , " he said again , more boldly now . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest tomorrow . " He stood up and started for the stairs . He did n't bother offering the changeling a hand because he knew it needed none . It owned the deep knowledge of rocks and grain and water , all the things of earth that needed no guide to help them in the way they ought to go . The changeling took a step to one side , barring his way , and met his eyes with a gaze solemn as a gravestone . It brought its hands out in front of it and grasped him by the wrist . Its grip was warm and slightly dusty , and the touch of it made his mind 's eye recall the weathered planks of old , half-tumbled barns . " Said to give you this , " the changeling rumbled . Blackened seed pearls on a string poured from its clumsy fingers , one badly cut blue stone dangling in their midst . It glimmered murky dim , the rheum-smeared eye of heaven . " Free pass , free passage . " " But I 'm not going anywhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his palm . " Except to bed . " He tried to give it back again . " Free opening of the way , " the changeling insisted , and it would not accept return of the unwanted gift , but sped away to its room before the Reverend Eldred could so much as try his hand at fatherly bullying with this proxy child . He followed after , absently brushing the golden stains of sawdust from the brown and olive pattern of the carpet up the stairs . The Reverend Eldred found his cold bed and had no need to ambush sleep . He slept long and he slept sound as any corpse he 'd ever buried . When he fell into the cool embrace of sheets and feather comforter it was without a single pang of conscience over what he 'd done . Why should he ? He 'd struck an honest , selfless bargain . In point of fact , the only thought that troubled him at all before dreamless slumber took him was the fleeting regret that he had not put out a second platter of shortbread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived . " I 'll see to that tomorrow , " he murmured to his pillow , and soon began to snore . THE NEXT DAY 'S morn was bright as wishes . Southering birds cut wedges of perfect blue from the sky . The Reverend Eldred at his breakfast table watched approvingly as the changeling Molly shoveled oatmeal into its briskly working mouth , its smile clicking on and off as needful when the housekeeper asked it a question or offered it an endearment . " And have you decided yet what you 'll be for Halloween , Molly dear ? " the good woman asked at last , fat , chapped hands gathering up the breakfast dishes . " I shall be the stump of a tree in the moonlight , " said the Molly-thing gravely . " An old hollow stump where a squirrel sleeps , a squirrel with quick and clever claws that scratch on polished wood , I shall be a goblin with a squirming sack on his back , a goblin who hurries through the darkness where water drips from stone and tender toadstools glow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She looked up suddenly , straight into the Reverend Eldred 's eyes . " I shall be a tear in the sack so very small that when he sets the burden down the goblin does not notice what leaks away into the dark and runs and runs on little naked feet , trying to find a way home . " " A clown ? " the housekeeper asked , smiling as she stacked the spoons . " How nice . I 'll be sure to bring you my granddaughter 's red shoes , if you 'd like them . " " Yes , please , " said the changeling , smiling . One tendril of her tawny hair trailed a path like spilled honey down the softness of her cheek . When the housekeeper was gone , the Reverend Eldred called the changeling child to come and stand before him by the breakfast table . " What was all that ? " he demanded . " What sort of talk of moons and stumps , sacks and squirrels ? " " You forgot the shortbread , " said the changeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who cares about you ? " " I see , I see . It 's punishment , all your lies about where my Molly 's gone ; a way to torment me in your maker 's name because I did n't keep the full measure of the bargain . And if my good housekeeper seemed to hear none of your nonsense , we must ascribe that mercy to her age or her angels . " The changeling 's laughter rattled the gilded plaster frames of old embroideries weighing down the dining room walls . " Angels do n't shut ears and eyes to miracles or magic . If that woman could n't hear what I had to say , it 's solely because her wings have rotted away like old gauze curtains . All her life 's left earthbound , the next true sound she 'll hear is the thump of clod on casket lid , but there are others in this waking world of yours who can see me for what I am . They 'll know what you 've done , once I tell them . You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll be brought to task for disposing of your daughter . " " Discovered ? " The Reverend Eldred 's eyes darted left and right , seeking his foretold betrayer in the room 's four quarters . " Disposing of - ? Oh ! Surely none would call it that . I 've given her a wondrous life to lead , dancing in the faerie ring , riding on dragon-back under warm , starlit skies . How could anyone fault me for that ? " " As men give kittens to the gods of river , lake and sea ? " the changeling countered . " Do their small paws now bat at bubbles blown from mermaids " lips , or chase eel tails , or do they drowse beneath the fronds of seaweed forests , purring in the bony laps of lost sailors ? " " Nonsense ! " the Reverend Eldred thundered . " No such thing at all ! My daughter 's safe , I tell you , and as for my own reputation , that 's secure as well . You 're here , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll talk , " the changeling contended . " I 'll talk , and oh , such things I 'll say as to make my tales of treetop rambles and lightfoot pawprints scattered over snow no more than wisps of poetry . I 'll tell them whole histories of your triflings with me , tell them to all who 'll listen , and I 'll choose my words so that they learn things of you that will come as a surprise to your ears as well . " " Lies ! " cried the man of God . " Not from my lips , " the changeling countered . " Not so any common man would notice . Not when clothed in my cleverness . " She tilted her head pertly and her eye flashed spite . " All over a lack of shortbread ? " The Reverend Eldred laid his hands upon his chest as if awaiting the leisure of his coffiner . " Well , well , I 've never dealt so tit-for-tat with my own folk , but I suppose it 's something I can learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your kin . Fine , then ; so be it . Tell my friend the goblin that a double portion of the best shortbread shall be his tonight at moonrise . And some oatmeal cookies , if he 's got a fancy for them besides . " " I 'm no one 's messenger , " the Molly-thing replied . " What 's there in this for me ? A snug nest piled deep with oak leaves ? A dream of unearthed chestnuts cast up in a shower of snow ? A lithesome branch that bends and springs to partner me in my midwinter frolics ? Free passage for you I 've brought , and still you bother me with errands ? Do it yourself , you sorry little man . " The Reverend Eldred surged out of his seat and clamped one hand around the changeling 's wrist . " I 'll do it and you 'll come with me , " he declared . " A worse compact than this I never struck . Who ever taught my friend to find his changelings in squirrel-haunted wood ! Fractious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine child you 'd make for me , I 'm sure ! I 'll have a better daughter for my hire , or learn the reason why . Back you shall go , and immediately . " " By daylight ? " The changeling laughed aloud . " You must be mad . " " Why not ? It was by daylight we first met , the goblin and L " " By daylight but by graveside . There 's all the world of difference in that place . " The Reverend Eldred snorted . " I do n't see why or how . " " You would n't , " said the Molly-thing . " You 're thick as a filbert shell . Daylight 's the banishment of such as he , excepting only in the sorrow  --  shadowed places . " " Bah ! " said the godsman , who when he came down to making such sounds was done with argument . To ward off the late October cold he snatched his great black overcoat from the curlicued mahogany rack by the front door , thrusting arms through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stitched . The creature he bundled into Molly 's red boiled wool jacket , then hustled it out the door before the housekeeper could emerge from the kitchen to question their going . He leaped the groundsel stone in the instant before the heavy household door swung shut at his back and slammed him into glaring impossibility . The street that hurled itself against his astounded sight was hot with summer sunlight . All the sidewalks blazed . Trees proudly cast their full crowns of leafy green into the face of heaven . The stench of burnt gasoline and broiling rubber tires rose up from the roadway outside the manse to strike the Reverend Eldred like a well-aimed blow between the eyes . He stood there sweating , dazed , one hand attached to the changeling 's wrist , the other stupidly clutching shut the neck of his coat against a crisp October wind that was not there . Dandelions laughed up at his folly from cracks in the shattered sidewalk . " What 's this ? " he cried , wiping dampness from his brow , glove leather dragging over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small attention , often no more than a wary glance . " What have you done ? " He fell to one knee before the changeling child and grabbed its shoulders tightly through heavy sleeves . " What 's this unlawful magic ? " Idlers whose only business was to mind the doings of the street grinned and snickered . The changeling showed him teeth more readily made for nibbling open the hard hulls of walnuts than for a good child 's affectionate expression . " I 've done nothing , but much has been done to me , none of it to my liking . You 've come with questions to the wrong place , if you want answers to match them . You might as well be talking to a block of wood . 11 " Ah , God . " The Reverend Eldred clapped one thin-gloved hand to his forehead . His words were neither supplication nor summoning , and thus could hold no power . " Ah , Lord , why has this come to me ? " " Nothing 's come : You sought it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your dragons slain . " The Molly-thing broke from the Reverend Eldred 's hand and capered in the street , in full view of all . Old women smiled to see the happy child and wishful young women devoured her with infant-hungry eyes . The godsman recovered himself and seized the girl again . " No nonsense , if you please , " he snapped . " You 'll take me where I need to go directly . " " Yes , Father . " The changeling drooped its head and let a teardrop trickle over the curve of its cheek . A sob loud enough to shiver the spire from the churchtop racked the little body . The eyes of every passerby whipped around to pierce the Reverend Eldred with black-capped censure . " It 's not - " he began , glancing anxiously from one silent rebuke to the next . " She is n't - We were only - " A second sob from the changeling 's throat and a wail that sounded like a small animal in pain overruled anything he might have said , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperation he leaped up , scooped the keening child into his arms , and dashed back up the flagstone path to the manse doorway . Snow bogged his footsteps before he 'd covered half the negligible distance . Drifts of icy white crept up past his ankles to snare him by the knees . His eyes squinted against the lash of snowflakes on the wind until he could find neither path nor door nor manse nor anything but the howling of tormented air whirling all around him . His world was white and gray except where trees in their black-barked ranks stood bare as - ratgnawed bones . The changeling in his arms , he stumbled toward their beckoning branches . The Molly-thing laughed to feel the twigs caress its hair . It reached out frost-reddened hands to grab at the passing tree limbs . " Stop that , " the Reverend Eldred gasped , jerking the creature 's hands away . " Here . Your hands are cold . Wear these . " He forced his good leather gloves over the changeling 's meddling paws , then picked it up again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in that wildwood came as almost no surprise to the man of God . He 'd read the stories , rejoiced in tales so often told that now the scent of woodsmoke from the tumbledown stone chimney was quite overwhelmed by the smell of musty books , their spines of tooled leather , their pages stiff with age . He staggered through the snow and thrust the plank door open without the courtesy of honest knock or even squirrel scratch on the boards . " What do you want ? " the old woman snarled , looking up from her blaring television set , a neat little handgun oiled to readiness in her claw . There were paper plates strewing the floor , cellophane wrappers and white pasteboard backings from old cupcakes , chicken bones in red-striped tubs streaked with cold grease . " Get out or I 'm calling the cops ! " The changeling offered up its most winning smile and said , " Put up thy weapon , goodwife ; we mean thee no harm . " " Eh ? " The old woman stared at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She flashed a suspicious look at the Reverend Eldred , who was brushing huge quantities of snow from his shoulders . " Who the hell sent for you ? Kid needs a shrink . Get out . " " I 'm sorry if we 've disturbed you , madam , " the godsman said , filling his words with as much courtliness as he could summon up in the circumstances . " My profuse apologies . You see , we lost our way in the wood , and it 's snowing heavily , and - " " What 's that to me ? Fuck off , " the old woman sniped , wattled face like a snapping turtle 's . " You look after your business , I 'll mind mine . " The Reverend Eldred 's expression grew stem at such treatment accompanied by such unseemly language . " Then call the police , if you like . At least they 'll see us safely home . " The old woman merely chuckled . " Call the cops ? Screw it . I was only joking . Less I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line 's dead . Get out and take your brat with you or I 'll shoot you where you stand and tell anyone who asks that you busted in here and tried to rob me . " Her voice turned quavery and small as she lifted up her eyes to an invisible interrogator : " Oh my goodness , yes , Officer , I was so frightened . That awful , awful man , breaking into a poor old woman 's home that way Why , I just do n't know what came over me . " " No one would believe you , " the Reverend Eldred said haughtily . " Not with this - my child here to testify . Besides , I am a man of God . I 'm known . " " Then you 'll be known for being something else before I 'm done with you , " the old woman replied , entirely at ease with the situation . " The dead ca n't say too much in their own defense . And as for your brat , she 'll be long gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frozen if they find her at all . Oh what a pity , dearie , dearie me . " " You 're an evil woman , " the Reverend Eldred said , glaring at the old woman as though the red fury in his eyes could kindle her aflame with witch-devouring fire . " Then leave me to be evil in peace ! " the beldame shrieked , flying from her chair to shove him back . The handgun dropped to the rag rug on the floor and bounced . The Molly-thing leaped to snatch it up and took a large bite from the barrel , purest licorice spiced with dust and grit and the salt of its mistress 's clammy hand . " Curses ! " the old woman cried , seeing her sham weaponry revealed for what it truly was . " Father said I always let my temper get the better of me . I hope he bums in Hell . " The Reverend Eldred pursed his lips in disapproval , and without thinking cast a wary look at the changeling , as if that creature might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such unfilial talk . " Your father did right to correct your faults of character , " he said . " To try to do so , at any rate . I expect there 's just so much a parent can do . " " How would you know if he even tried ? " the changeling demanded around a mouthful of licorice . " Just so much a parent can do , if one chooses to do anything at all . " Black rivulets slithered from the corners of its mouth , giving it the look of a ventriloquist 's dummy . The Reverend Eldred nabbed the creature 's wrist once more . " We 're going , " he told it . " Snow or no snow , we 're getting out of this ghastly place . " He opened the bottom two buttons of his overcoat and dug into his trouser pocket with his free hand . " My blessed free passage is all you harp on . Very well , so let it be , you 've won . Free passage out of here 's all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this trinket to obtain it and we 're quits . And not an instant before I 'd like it . " Sooty seed pearls shone in the glare of the still-braying television set . A single blue stone caught and captured the cold light of tiny people chattering like caged squirrels over little things . " Oh ! " The old woman lifted up her hands toward the glittering stone , the gleaming pearls . The light they snared and held pulsed through the thin flesh of her fingers , showing the fragile bones . She tried to seize it but the Reverend Eldred jerked it away and she collapsed wailing in the tumbled trash beside her tattered chair . " What do you want with this thing ? " he asked of her . " It 's grimy and old , worth little if not nothing . Besides , it 's mine . " " And mine , once , " the old woman wept . " Mine . Free pass , free passage , free opening of the way . Ah , the beating of their great emerald  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver-tailed sirens from the distant reefs , the high , wild , gladsome pipes of Faerie that partnered us in our moonlight dances ! Times are , when I turn down my bed at night and set my shoes aside , I think that I still feel the tender grass underfoot and the cool sweetness of the dew between my toes . " She yanked off shoe and stocking to display a foot whose skin had hardened into horn , toenails tough and thick as any goblin 's . The Reverend Eldred let go of the changeling 's wrist and knelt beside the grief-bent old woman . " Whose child were you ? " he breathed , cupping her heel in the palm of his hand . The seed pearl strand snaked up to ring her ankle and the light that throbbed from that flimsy shackle banished scaly skin and wrinkles , liver spots and the slowly hardening shell the years had laid down . The ancient toenails shrank from yellowing planks to small , pink bits like the frost-captured petals of a rose , the ungainly foot itself melted back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His eyes flickered up to meet his daughter 's face , revealed for the merest wink of time behind that age-harrowed mask of bleak days and barren years . " Ah , God ! " the Reverend Eldred cried , and this time there was a heart that broke behind the words , love that bled and wept . He hugged the withered body of his child , willing back her infant softness , her vanished youth , the ripeness of years that he bad shut away the moment he bequeathed her to the goblin 's keeping . " Let me go . " Crabbed hands pushed weakly against his chest . An old woman with one bare foot as aged as the rest of her fought free of his embrace . " Molly , do n't you know me ? " the Reverend Eldred implored , striving to caress her cheek , to brush his fingers through the iron gray tangle of her hair . " Know you ? " she said . " No . Why should I ? You 're nothing to me but a trespasser . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I wish I could . I like to be alone ; it 's safe . If I did n't believe it before , it 's people like you who teach me the same lesson all over again . Everything out there 's spoiled , rotted through , ready to fall to pieces . Everywhere you look you find death , disaster , heartbreak , loss . Doctors kill us , teachers show us our stupidity , leaders march us over cliffs to the sound of bugles , lovers might as well be talking to a mirror , mothers ought to squat over open graves when they give birth just to save time . Best keep yourself to yourself and wait life out , if you want to come through it unscathed . I 'm the only one who 's sane enough to know how things work in this world . " She pulled herself backward , away from him , so that her head was haloed by the television screen . " And my name 's not Molly . " " How can you say that ? " the Reverend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw your true face , I know you : You 're my child . " " You 're crazy ! " the old woman shouted , gesturing wildly with one arthritis-knotted hand . " Just as crazy as your kid . Go on , get out of here , there 's nothing in this house you need ! " " But what about this ? " He held out the seed-pearl strand , the dangling blue stone . She could n't help but see it . " You said it was yours once . Take it ! Take it and come back to what you were ! " She shook her head vigorously . " Oh no , " she said . " You wo n't fool me twice . That 's just a gewgaw , plain and simple , a bauble , a trinket , a trifle . Take it and stick it where the sun do n't shine ! " The Reverend Eldred might have pressed his point , but just then the old woman summoned up a burst of startling strength from some unsuspected reservoir and sprang to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , collar and seat , and dragged him to the door . The changeling scampered ahead to hold it open , giggling in a manner some might call mad if they were unfamiliar with the workings of a squirrel 's mind . Balmy air wafted over the Reverend Eldred 's face as he found himself flying out of the lowly hut and headfirst into the gracious green of a springtime meadow . He landed on his nose amid the daisies . The sun cradled him in warmth , the new grass gave up a sweet savor where his weight crushed it . He pushed himself groggily to hands and knees and looked around , dazed . The winter woods were gone , all was pasture , sweet rolling hills misted over with flowers . Here and there he glimpsed a solitary willow and the aimless wandering of a brook . The grass stirred with a thousand insects and the private commerce of fieldmice . " You did n't lose it , did you ? " the changeling asked , leaning its full weight on the Reverend Eldred 's still-bowed back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ah , no , there it is . " It stooped to pluck at the seed pearl string , still wrapped tightly around his hand . The Reverend Eldred stood up , brushing bits of grass from his coat . " We must go back , " he said , searching the meadow for the vanished cottage . " I ca n't just leave her there like that , alone . " " Why not ? Out of practice ? " The changeling danced in an ecstasy of springtime over the meadow , then with a giggle took to its heels , racing up the hillside . " Stop ! Come back ! " The godsman 's commands were empty air , and the changeling was out of sight behind the hill before he realized how useless it was to expect obedience of a being that knew neither dread nor duty . " No wonder the world 's gone the way it has , " he muttered as he set out smartly after the wanton thing . " Overrun with such creatures , I should n't be at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other mortal folk had come to strike similar bargains with goblinkind for the removal and replacement of their trueborn children , that was a path whose shadows soon turned him back . It was easier to hunt the changeling child , and so that was what he did . He climbed the hill 's crest in time to see the Molly-thing leaping the brook at its foot . He reached the brook in time to spy the changeling dash happily across a fresh expanse of green . Boiled wool jacket went flying free , a flash of red against a sky too blue for earthbound eyes to bear . Shoes were kicked away , and stockings promptly followed after only an awkward hop or two to roll them down and toss them aside . Dress and smallclothes spattered the landscape , puddles of gleefully abandoned cloth , until the changeling was a tiny , pink-skinned figure in the middle distance , naked except for the godsman 's too-big leather gloves . They flapped at the ends of the creature 's arms like the wings of captive moths , but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . A pale golden sawdust haze trailed after it , a sunlit , skyborne ribbon-road for sylphs , pixies , sprites , and feys to ride . Ride it they must and did : it did n't take them long to rise to such a lure . The airy folk were dancing down the golden pathway in the changeling 's wake by the time the Reverend Eldred caught up close enough to hear the Molly-thing 's ungovernable laughter . Minuscule silver-green fingers plucked at his hair . His nostrils filled with the flowery scent of the fey , his cheeks were gently battered by the beating of their gossamer wings . Grimly he closed his mouth as he ran on , lest he inhale wonders . At the top of a second hill , his heel slipped on a patch of shade . sheltered dew and he went skidding down the slope , feet flailing air . The fairies swarmed up , wings humming in a frenzy of alarm , only to settle down in a blanket of jeweled beauty over his black greatcoat when he came to rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shield his eyes from their myriad sloe-eyed stares , and the blue stone snared on its rope of pearls twirled from his fingers in the sunlight . The faerie host fell back in awe at the sight , making the music of their alien tongue , and offered him neither help nor hindrance when he again got to his feet . " Where did she go ? " he asked them as he stood scanning the horizon 's compass in a slow circle of despair . The Molly-thing was gone , lost to view . It seemed impossible - the world before him was wide open - and yet she 'd somehow contrived to run fast and far enough so that he could no longer see her , not even as a pinprick in the distance . The tender grass of springtime would not yield up so much as a bent stalk to give him some clue as to which way she 'd run . " Where is she ? Help me ! Take me to her , I beg you . " And in the moment of that plea he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but his own child . He held out his two hands cupped together , as if he hoped to feed the folk of air and light an offering of nectar . Pearls gleamed serenely between his trembling fingers . " Grant me , bright ones , free pass , free passage , free opening of the way ! " The faerie host hovered in the air just above his hands for the time it would take him to rattle through his old good-nights with Molly , then all of them ascended in a cloud of winged splendor and were lost against the burning circle of the sun . The Reverend Eldred , ridiculous in his somber coat and ardent entreaties , was left to stand alone . He stood there thus for some time , helpless in the midst of the bright spring meadow 's beauty . No matter in which direction he gazed , there was no sign to make it seem more worthy of his footsteps than any other . So much equivalence baffled him into immobility ; only his lips moved to whisper , " Molly ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeze to answer . " Ah , God ! " His cry of loss split heaven open to the bone . Had he looked up instead of crumpling earthward he might have seen angels staring down at him in startlement . He gripped the strand of grimy pearls between white-knuckled hands clasped so tightly in prayer that they shook like dying leaves . His head was bowed , his whole body hunched forward , his eyes squeezed shut to the point where doubt remained as to whether he 'd ever find the strength to open them again and see the world he 'd made himself . He rocked there on his knees , moaning Molly 's name and calling on his God from out of that ache beyond a broken heart which is a broken soul . " There now , friend . " A coarse hand closed itself around both of his as easily as a man might lay hold of a walnut . " If you wanted her back so bad , you 'd but to say . " The godsman lifted up his eyes and saw the goblin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he always was , save for the fact that now he no longer came cap-in-hand , but instead held a familiar pair of gloves . He took a step backward , letting go the Reverend Eldred 's hands , until he 'd edged himself up against the clean , cold stone that marked a woman 's grave . " Where is she ? " the Reverend Eldred entreated him , kneeling among autumn-withered ivy shoots , hands still welded in prayer . " Give her back to me ! " " No back about it , " the goblin said . " Seein " as how I never took her away . " " You .. never - ? " " She sleeps where I found her , all tucked in nice an " proper in her own bed , as is only fittin ' . " The goblin nodded , satisfied with this state of things , for the goblins are a race notorious for their love of due process and propriety . " As you might 've seen for yourself if you 'd taken the bother to go look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone , " the Reverend Eldred whispered . " As soon as the changeling came to me that night , I simply assumed that it had been left with me in exchange for something . For her . For Molly . " " ' Twere n't no changeling . " The goblin tipped him a wink . " ' T were only me . " " You ? " The godsman stared . " Sure as stone . I thought the better of our pact , but what use was that ? I knew there 'd be no bringin " you around by argufyin ' . You 'd fight to hold me to the bargain . " The Reverend Eldred shook his head slowly . " I only wanted to shelter her from a hard world . " The ivy stems between his knees writhed into the face of the old woman in the woods . Her scowl was terrible to see , and she parted twisted brown lips as if to repeat her cynic 's litany . The godsman jerked his gaze away sharply , wanting neither to hear nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the best , " he offered weakly . " Did you , now ? " The goblin 's soft-spoken question was the delicate touch of a tongue against an aching tooth . The godsman winced to hear it . " No , " he admitted dully , and with that small truth he felt confession cleanse his soul . " Not her best , but my own . " He climbed slowly to his feet , one hand leaning upon the rough , unpolished top of the gravestone . " I 've done wrong , but I 'll make amends . " " Then go home , " said the goblin , " and see that you do . " With which he took the Reverend Eldred 's gloves in one hand and lashed them sharply across the godsman 's eyes . The pain blazed red , then black with fleeting blindness . The Reverend Eldred cried out at the searing touch . He staggered back , groping with one hand for the support of another gravestone , only to have his fingers close on air , then on panic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He opened his eyes to the same familiar study he 'd quitted hours or days or ages ago . Something glinted on the windowsill . He rose from his seat and saw the china plate licked clean of shortbread crumbs . " Father ? " His daughter 's voice turned him where he stood , the plate trembling in his hand . Tall and womanly , she filled his sight with the same tranquil beauty he 'd last seen on another face now lost beneath earth and ivy and a chiseled stone . " I heard you shout , " she said , hovering in the doorway like a dream , holding her soft yellow robe closed at the collar . " I thought you might wake the children , but we were lucky . Are you all right ? " " Molly ? " The godsman took one uncertain step toward the woman . His sight blurred with tears and time , yet still he scanned her face for evidence of how the world 's harshness might have marked her . The corners of her eyes and mouth were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few sorrows , but they were warm as a welcoming hearthfire . She crossed the room to meet him more than halfway , resting her hands on his shoulders and giving him a kiss . " You must have nodded off in your chair , " she said . " Worn out , poor love ; those children of mine can be a handful , I know . I 'll take that to the kitchen for you . " She relieved him of the empty plate and was gone . " Children ... Her children - ! " The Reverend Eldred staggered to the open window . " Lost , " he breathed into the night . " So much I 've lost , thrown away - " It- not got yet , " said a voice from the frost-killed flowerbed beneath the sill . The goblin sprang into view , jigging dead geranium stems out from between his toes . " Sorry , " he said , gruff as an unearthed badger . " Brought you back to her instead of her back to you . But see ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried . " " I did that ? " The Reverend Eldred gazed longingly after his grown daughter . " I was able to save her from the world ? " " She did n't want saving from it . " The goblin patted the godsman 's hand . " They never do . " " Then what - ? " " Only to be taught the way to see it . What 's the world but frights and wonders ? " the goblin asked . " Music and bones , sunlight and swords , hunger and butterflies . Who 'll give " em the wisdom to choose aright if all they 're taught is fear of everything ? " " But so much evil - ! " the godsman protested . " The world 's no less wondrous for all that . Not every serpent 's got a sting , and yet .. some do . You taught her how to tell . That was the saving of her ; aware 's not afraid . Stones bruise or break you , yet it 's stones that make good , solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eldred slumped against the window , drunk with riddles . " Right , home , just as you say . My mistake , your coming here , but no harm , no harm , quickly cured , soon mended , wo n't take a minute . " Fine leather gloves flapped like batwings in the moonlight . The Reverend Eldred blinked and found himself staring not out a window but dead on at a door . Dazed , he had no idea at all of how he 'd come there , nor where he 'd been , nor what he ought to do next . In the end , he decided he would not have come to a door he did not intend to open . The room was snug and smelled of white soap , with only the steadfast glow of a shepherdess nightlight to ward back the darkness . " Daddy ? " Molly mewled drowsily from her bed and rutched around under the covers . " Is it morning ? " She was asleep again before he could answer . He closed the door and went downstairs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all waiting patiently . He sat there in the velvet-covered wingback chair , staring into the dwindling flames for a time outside of time . He thought that there was something he ought to remember , a journey forgotten or not yet begun . Pipe smoke crept up the invisible trellis of the air . The old case clock on the mantelpiece was still , though in the silence where its heavy ticks and tocks once fell , the godsman now heard only the measured flap of dragons " wings , the chin of faerie flight , a squirrel 's mad , mindless chatter , the cold blare of an old woman 's television set , and beyond them all , the laughter of a child . When his pipe went out , he rose and went back up the stairs to the closed bedroom door . He did not return to his study alone . An autumn dawn was just streaking the sky with pink and purple and gold when the goblin poked his snout over the windowsill and stole into the godsman 's study . Flat feet slapped across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who slept in the big wingback chair , his daughter in his arms . The rise and fall of their sleeping breaths barely stirred the priceless string of pearls with its diamond pendant that interlaced their fingers . Very carefully , very dexterously for one whose hands looked to have all the grace of shovel blades , the goblin plucked the luminous strand free without disturbing either sleeper . He held it up to the first dazzle of day and chuckled softly to himself before cramming it into his trousers " back pocket and scrambling out the window . He paused for only a breath upon the sill , and a last backward glance at the dreamers . " Not shortbread - " He set his cap at a more rakish angle on his blocky head . " - but it 'll do . " A morning free of sorrow 's shadows took him , and he was gone from the godsman 's house forever .
