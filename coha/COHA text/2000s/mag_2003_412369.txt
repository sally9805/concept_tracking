This New York-based artist conjures narratives that raise more questions than they answer . <p> The paintings of Stone Roberts beg comparison with those of the Dutch and Flemish painters of the 15th through 17th centuries . His smaller canvases in particular  --  the still lifes and figurative works  --  bear the lapidary imprint of these masters , which invites the presumption , at least , that some verifiable reality is on view . Confronted with Roberts ' Danae or Spring , Hillsdale , for example , one might recall that Jan van Eyck 's Arnolfini Marriage Portrait took verisimilitude to notarial extremes in serving as a sort of wedding certificate for Giovanni Arnolfini and Jeanne de Chenany in 1434 . The Flanders Panel , contemporary novelist Arturo Perez-Reverte 's tale in which a Flemish painter hides clues to a murder in his portrait of a game of chess , may also come to mind . The two paintings  --  one actual , one fictional  --  are realistic in at least one respect : Their iconography bears a close relationship to the subject matter depicted . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For this artist , realism is a language for conjuring images of subtle imagination , works that speak to the deepest levels of experience . <p> Take Danae and Spring , Hillsdale : Each began as a study for a larger painting , with a woman resting on a couch as the central premise . This kind of compositional " filament " typically emerges from a formal idea , says Roberts , rather than from a preoccupation with subject matter . With Danae , he did not set out to make a painting based on the myth of Acrisius ' daughter ravaged by Zeus in a shower of gold ; he knew only that he wanted to paint a recumbent figure wrapped in two colors of sheet . Spring , Hillsdale also commenced with his wife and primary model , Betsey , posing on the selfsame couch . In both instances , a series of sketches convinced him not to place the figure in a larger composition after all , but to render it as a finished painting , adding background details as the fancy struck him . The result presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fidelity to the way things look , yet neither one is the portrait of anything even remotely " real . " Instead , each raises narrative possibilities that involve the viewer in a highly subjective guessing game , as do all of Roberts ' paintings . <p> Born and raised at the juncture of the Great Smoky and the Blue Ridge mountains , in Asheville , North Carolina , Roberts made his way to New York City via Yale University in New Haven , Connecticut , then the Tyler School of Art at Temple University in Philadelphia . As an undergraduate , he studied drawing with realist painter William Bailey and more seriously committed himself to painting during a year 's graduate fellowship in Rome , when he studied with Ronald Markman . Painstaking in his pursuit of technical mastery , Roberts was 33 years old when he completed his first large-scale painting , Janet ( not shown ) , a figurative work that , among others , references Vermeer in its composition and treatment of light . Two years in the making , it was acquired in 1985 by The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over the next decade , Roberts produced a remarkable body of work  --  a series of exquisitely rendered still lifes punctuated by more ambitious and time-consuming figurative paintings . Collectively , they invoke the artifacts , mores , and manners of a vanishing breed of Americans . A transplanted Southern gentleman , Roberts found his subjects in the same upper-middle-class Protestant culture mined by A.R . Gurney in Children and The Dining Room . And much of the appeal of Roberts ' paintings , as with Gurney 's plays , lies in their perfect anthropological pitch . One " reads " these paintings for their fabulous orchestration of details and for the implications raised by their specificity . <p> Here , painted anachronistically  --  as if Ingres or David were somehow alive and well in Westport , Connecticut-are contemporary scenes replete with Princess phones , Hermes scarves , Limoges pillboxes , and the like . <p> With works such as Venus and Adonis , The Visit , and Paul and Caro , Roberts evinces a stem commitment to the art of preparation . He began each with sketches to work out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then did elaborate perspective drawings and oil-grisaille studies , and finally , a complete graphite study , or cartoon , of each composition , which he laid out in grid form and transferred to his canvas . The artist speaks eloquently about the need for a clear conception from the drawing stage , for a solid , formal structure within which to paint and experiment with the elements of color , form , and intensity of light . <p> When it comes to the actual painting , however , Roberts grows reticent , proffering words such as " ineffable " and " abstract " to say that , for him , the process is not easily verbalized . Partly , this is because his approach is nonformulaic ; he follows no set method . Rather , he improvises from painting to painting , passage to passage . When asked , for instance , if he uses glazes to achieve his remarkably lambent colors , he notes that all translucent paints are glazes  --  technically speaking  --  but that he has no established phase for their application . He does say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with the ideas , especially since the execution is so time-consuming , and he is eager to avoid the pitfalls of the banal , the Pop , the sentimental , and the overly ironic . He adds that part of the challenge of painting lies in making his initial ideas work , so he begins by simply taking a stab at it  --  a first pass  --  knowing that he will return to the canvas again and again . With an eye for texture and intensity and balance of light , he then works from the precipitating idea , playing with it and arranging the painting 's internal harmonies as the artwork begins to manifest itself . The more he paints , the better he is at predicting what the finished work will look like . <p> In the past , Roberts has tacked between still lifes and figures , largely for spiritual replenishment . For the last year and a half , however , he has devoted himself entirely to an ambitious series of large-scale figurative works that he plans to exhibit within a few years at Salander-O'Reilly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fowler credits Larry Salander , Roberts ' dealer , with encouraging this shift , noting , " Stone 's direction has changed and changed and changed as he has gone along , particularly in his use of light and color . " <p> A single work , the 96 " - x- 72 " September  --  West 74th Street , took Roberts eight months to complete , illustrating the degree of risk that he has assumed in the new series . At this size , too , the handling of paint becomes looser and more interpretive , as can be seen particularly in the treatment of the bananas and goblet , and this means trading a degree of formal resolution for sheer impact . The power of these paintings is undeniable , and the artist 's signature ambiguities remain . For Brooke and John Fowler , who recently acquired September  --  West 74th Street , the painting raises two quick questions : Why is the male figure looking to the side ? and  --  in reference to the stamen-snipping female  --  Whom is she castrating ? <p> Acknowledging a range of developments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now than before to dispense with the cartoon ; often he paints over a rudimentary drawing informed by sketch work . And he has moved beyond the need for the kind of mythic and literary allusions that characterized many of his earlier paintings . Nowadays his references are not external , as they necessarily were while he was making his mark as a painter , but instead are directed to his own body of work . His efforts center on the painting process itself and his own capacities and the potential of the work . After mastering the requisite techniques and developing his voice , Roberts is reaching for something that he hopes will ride out the vagaries of fashion . For the time being , at least , the full dimensions of that something remain veiled from public scrutiny . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : September  --  West 74th Street , 2000-2001 , oil on linen , 96 x 72 .
