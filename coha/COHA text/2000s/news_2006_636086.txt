<p> MAMARONECK , N.Y .  --  He was here only in body . His psyche , his soul , his ability to play golf better than any man who ever lived  --  let 's just say Eldrick Woods came to the U.S. Open , but Tiger stayed home . I 've been there when he seemingly has crossed into the superhuman , when he won seven of 11 majors , buried racism at Augusta National , won by a staggering 15 shots at Pebble Beach and awed the gods at St. Andrews . <p> And I was there Friday afternoon at Winged Foot when his tired eyes looked like 50-pound free weights , when he removed his " TW " cap and revealed a receding hairline and new creases on his forehead , when his confident strut was reduced to a resigned , limp slumber . Oh , how we all would have shed a tear this weekend had Woods won the Open for his father , Earl , who passed away in early May . But grief , damned grief , has a dastardly way of neutralizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional lives . <p> " I was not ready to play golf , " said Tiger , stating the obvious . <p> Rather than hoist a trophy for Pops on Father 's Day , Woods will be somewhere else . In a development we might not see again , he shot double 76s , tumbled to 12 over par and missed his first cut in 38 major championships as a pro . Even when factoring in his heavy burden , it was shocking to see the great El Tigre shrinking into a two-day hacker who hit only seven of 28 possible fairways and needed a troubling 63 putts to get through his rounds . This was in striking contrast to the second-round leader , former University of Illinois star Steve Stricker , who can tell his grandkids he hit 19 of 28 fairways in the same U.S. Open when Woods spent so much time in the woods  --  not to mention the bunkers , the galleries , downtown Mamaroneck and in rough denser than some tropical rainforests . <p> Bravely , before he left on his jet , Tiger reflected on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from competitive golf and the disappointment shock ? of playing poorly . " What transpired off the golf course gives you a different type of perspective , but I do n't care if you have what transpired in my life or not , " he said . " Poor execution is never going to feel real good . " <p> Preparation just was n't there <p> It 's obvious he was n't ready to resume the grind , physically or mentally . Usually the master of meticulous preparation , Woods was baffled , for instance , that the greens were n't playing faster . Rival Phil Mickelson , who remains in contention for his third straight major title , spent so much time at Winged Foot recently that he realized rainy spring weather had reduced speed on the greens . Woods was too busy burying his dad and answering a nation 's condolences to prepare with the necessary depth . <p> " You 're in the mind-set of a U.S. Open , and usually U.S. Open greens are really quick , " he said . " The greens were just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Hearing this , you almost wish he would n't have come . It is n't our business to tell Tiger Woods when he wants to return from a jolting life experience , but if the golfing world ever wanted to issue a mulligan for an eyesore major , it was after watching him finish with the same score as amateur Billy Horschel , aging jokester Peter Jacobsen and two virtual unknowns whose names were made for golf , Nathan Green and Taylor Wood . At least Michael Campbell , the defending Open champ , could give him some well-known company in 12-over land . The other day , Woods said he believed he was ready for the Open and referred to his father 's general philosophy on when to return after a break . <p> " Dad was always adamant about whenever you 're ready to play , play . If you 're not ready , do n't play , " Woods said . " If you 're not mentally ready to play , you 're not going to be there . So he was always adamant for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . ... I played 20 times a year on Tour , and he said , Why are you playing so much ? ' Because of the things I had to deal with and the amount of time that I prepare for events , he 's always told me to take more time off . " <p> Maybe he should have taken his advice this time . Missing the cut was n't what anyone had in mind , including the people at Nike , who agreed with Tiger 's wish last winter to produce a Father 's Day commercial honoring dads everywhere . The ads will run this weekend , and it will seem a little awkward when we see grainy film of Earl and his toddler phenom . But we 'll still smile , too . Woods did n't have much to say about missing the cut , probably because it 's such a foreign concept . He had put together a record streak of 142 successful cuts before finishing out of the money last year at the Byron Nelson Classic . <p> " It 's not something you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd gone a while without missing one . Unfortunately , I missed this one . ... It 's not rust , no . Unfortunately , I just did n't put it together at the right time . I just could n't execute properly . " <p> Rust , inactivity , exhaustion ... whatever you call it , Woods was a weary imposter . That he did n't fear the worst-case scenario  --  playing poorly in a major in his first event in two months  --  impressed his fellow competitors . " I mean , come on , " Campbell said . " He 's actually very emotional right now . It 's one of those things where he 's human , and it 's going to be tough for him to come back . Toughest conditions in the world at a major , first time coming back after nine weeks off , his father passing away  --  I mean , God , you 've got to give him credit for actually turning up . That 's one thing that I really admire about Tiger , that he wanted to come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plenty of drama remains <p> The Open still has compelling stories . Can Mickelson put himself within a British Open victory of holding all four major titles at once , or a Lefty Slam ? Can Colin Montgomerie finally shed the title of Best Player Never to Win a Major ? Will Stricker strike a blow for Cheeseheads everywhere and win his first major ? Was that actually David Duval , ranked 402nd in the world , blowing off the cobwebs of his former No. 1 days with a brief uprising Friday ? And , of course , you have the star of the show , Winged Foot , playing as murderous as advertised . <p> The question now for Woods is when he 'll regain his legendary fire . Remember , he is 30 and married , all grown up . He is immersed in his charitable arm , the Tiger Woods Foundation . He does n't obsess over winning and losing as he once did , an equilibrium that will gain even more balance with his father 's passing . What 's next ? <p> " Practice , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Probably the Western , " he said , with loud cheering audible from Lemont , Ill . <p> And his immediate goal ? <p> " Hopefully , I can win the British . " <p> It would n't have the same impact as winning on Father 's Day . But surely , the Earl of Woods would appreciate it as much . <p> Jay Mariotti is a regular on " Around the Horn " at 4 p.m. on ESPN .
