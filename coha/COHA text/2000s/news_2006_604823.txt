<p> If the 2005 U.S. Open proved anything about American tennis , it 's that the men are not a solo act . <p> After Andy Roddick 's mojo-deflating first-round exit , members of his de facto backup band , Robby Ginepri and James Blake , made stirring runs . Both lost in five sets to Andre Agassi on his way to the final , but Blake came within two points of beating the 35-year-old star to set up a semifinal showdown with Ginepri . One of them would have been the first man from the USA not named Pete Sampras , Agassi or Roddick to reach a Grand Slam tournament final in six years . <p> Add to that mix the improving but inconsistent Taylor Dent , whose net-smothering game scored him big wins against top-10 players , and suddenly the future does n't look like a one-man show . <p> " I hope they continue , " Roddick says of his compatriots . " Now it 's just a matter for those guys to be able to do it week in and week out . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising . " <p> Says U.S. Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe , " For the first time , I can say they are knocking on the door to reaching their potential . " <p> The Australian Open , which begins Monday ( Sunday night ET ) in Melbourne , offers the first glimpse of whether this troika can keep the momentum going and open the door . <p> Ginepri , Blake and Dent are coming off their best seasons . All finished with career-high year-end rankings , led by Ginepri 's No.17 and book-ended by Dent 's No.29 . Blake closed the year at No.24 . The question is can they take it a notch higher and help bring U.S. tennis out of the doldrums of mediocrity ? <p> Although there is more road ahead than behind , these pros arrive in Melbourne facing another reality : the onset of middle age , at least in tennis terms . Ginepri is 23 , Dent is 24 and Blake , the elder of the group , turned 26 last month . It would be unfair to call 2006 a make-or-break season because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not much . <p> Two-plus years ago , this Brat Pack of young Americans seemed poised to join Roddick among the game 's elite . Barely into their 20s , Ginepri , Dent and Mardy Fish all finished 2003 ranked among the top 35 , and Blake reached No.28 the year before . ( Fish was injured for most of 2005 and is recovering from wrist surgery . ) <p> Injuries , immaturity and perhaps too much success too early punctured holes in the early bubble of promise . Ginepri started to go through the motions and lost his motivation . The 6-2 Dent often broke down physically in long matches or during two-week events , a victim of his own lack of training . Blake suffered through a string of horrific personal incidents , breaking his neck in a training fall , coming down with a face-paralyzing illness and losing his father . <p> " This is prime time for these guys , " says former No.1 Jim Courier , a member of the golden generation of U.S. men that included Sampras , Michael Chang and Agassi . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> No one is watching more closely than McEnroe , who will choose from among them the No.2 singles player behind Roddick for when the USA faces Romania in February in a first-round Davis Cup matchup . <p> " They 've all set themselves up for a career year , " McEnroe says , but each will have to maintain focus and keep improving the weaker areas . <p> Dent needs to keep fit so his chronically injured body does n't break down ; Blake must cut down on errors and back up his sometimes suspect first serve ; Ginepri will have to stay mentally strong and keep the rallies long while sneaking into the net from time to time to knock off volleys . <p> " Robby has a legitimate shot to sneak into the top 10 , " says Brad Gilbert , who coached Roddick and Agassi and does commentary for ESPN . <p> All of which is to say Melbourne , site of the year 's first major , is the ideal stage to build upon their promising 2005 campaigns . Their slates are clean , their stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has there been no emotional letdown but that their hard offseason work has paid off . <p> But the searing and unpredictable Australian summer can throw a wrench into it all . <p> " Australia is the land of opportunity , but it 's also the land of doubt , " says Todd Martin , who coaches Fish and was the last American besides Sampras , Agassi and Roddick to reach a Grand Slam final , in the 1999 U.S. Open . <p> " If they get off to a good start , they will probably continue in that fashion . But if they do n't , they will have to convince themselves pretty quickly that ' I am as good as I was last year , ' that it was n't a fluke . " <p> Blake roars back <p> James Blake plummeted to No.210 in spring 2005 after missing most of 2004 , forcing him to play in some low-level ATP Challenger tournaments before he began to find his mojo . Always one of the fastest players on tour and possessing an explosive forehand , Blake finally began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by going for too much too early . <p> He reached the final in Washington , D.C. , and won in New Haven , Conn. , before upsetting No.2 Rafael Nadal of Spain in the U.S. Open and falling to Andre Agassi in his first-career Grand Slam quarterfinal . <p> " Knowing that I was that close to a semi or final , it makes me realize that the goal going into these Slams is n't just getting to the second week , " says Blake , whose comeback from illness , injury and his father 's death from cancer made him the feel-good story of the U.S. Open even before he lost an epic quarterfinal match 7-6 in the fifth set to Agassi . " Maybe I can get in there and win one . " Dent gets fitter <p> Taylor Dent showed flashes of brilliance last season , defeating top-notch players such as Lleyton Hewitt , Marat Safin and David Nalbandian . <p> But the affable Californian  --  whose Australian father , Phil , was a top-10 player in the 1970s  --  did n't win any titles and faltered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no further than the round of 16 in Wimbledon . <p> Still , he finished a career-best No.29 . More important , Dent has rededicated himself to squeezing out every bit of talent . In the fall he left his native Huntington Beach and bought a 5,200-square-foot home near the famed Bollettieri/IMG Academy in Sarasota , Fla. , in order to find better competition and to train with fitness guru Jason Riley . <p> Dent says Riley has been " kicking my butt . " With increased weight training , Dent says he has reduced his body fat from a paunchy 18% to below 10% . " It 's the best shape of my life , without a doubt , " he says . Ginepri regains his hunger <p> Robby Ginepri does n't possess Andy Roddick 's 150-mph serve or James Blake 's flashy forehand . But under the tutelage of ex-pro Francisco Montana , the laid-back Georgian realizes he can win with his speed , rock-solid groundstrokes and improving serve . <p> That discovery was fueled in July , when Ginepri lost in the first round of Wimbledon and fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge wake-up call , " he says . <p> Ginepri played like a man possessed in the second half of 2005 , reaching his first Grand Slam tournament semifinal in New York , winning his second ATP title in Indianapolis by beating junior rival Roddick for the first time as a pro and making a second Masters Series semifinal in Madrid in the fall , proving his U.S. Open was no accident . <p> " It was like two entirely different seasons , " Ginepri says . " I feel like I 'm playing top-five tennis right now . " <p> PHOTO , B/W , Tony Ashby , AFP/Getty PHOTO , B/W , Daniel Ochoa de Olza , AP
