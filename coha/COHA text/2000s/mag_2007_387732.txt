Headnote With two Oscars to her credit and a hit TV show on her hands , Sally Field is too busy to be sidelined by a troubling diagnosis . We caught up with the energetic star on the eve of her Big 6-0. // Depending on your age , your favorite Sally Field role might date back to 1965 and " Gldget , " the teenage surfer whose antics always landed her in hot water . A gldget , fans learned , was a girl who was n't very tall but was n't a midget . Get it ? Then came the role of Sister Bertrille , the flying nun whose ability to take flight resulted from her weight , a scant 90 pounds , and her wacky headgear that looked like a paper airplane built by committee . The plots were a stretch , but Sally 's likability factor kicked In-viewers liked her , they really liked her-and both sitcoms were hits . Some 40 years and 28 motion pictures later , her star has n't dimmed . She 's successfully made the transition from cute-as-a-button ingnue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the process . Besides her Oscar-winning roles in Norma Roe and Places in the Heart , she 's starred in such audience favorites as Smokey and the Bandit , Mrs. Doubtfire and Forrest Gump . Most recently she 's returned to television as Nora Walker in ABC 's Sunday night drama Brothers &; Sisters and has a recurring role as Maggie Wyczenski in NBC 's ER . As if these activities are n't enough to keep her busy , she 's signed on as an advocate for women 's health , a cause she took up with gusto after learning that she has osteoporosis . It turned out that the petite stature that qualified her for early TV fame also made her a likely candidate for chronic bone loss . The Post caught up with Sally on the eve of her 60th birthday , a milestone she describes as " significant . " Now a grandmother , she 's as fit as in her Gidget days ; her weight still qualifies her for liftoff in the Sister Bertrille tradition , and her likability score remains off the charts . Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this a shock or had you been having problems ? Sally Field : I 'm lucky to have a really good doctor . If I do n't make an appointment for an annual physical exam , he calls me and asks , " Where are you ? " For about a year he had been watching my bone density , in addition to looking at my blood pressure , cholesterol and all the other things you should be watching as you get older . He knew there was a strong possibility that I might have a problem with bone loss because I 'm a prime candidate . I 'm over 50 , small , Caucasian , and it 's in my family . For a while , my bone density was borderline , then it went to osteopenia , which is a precondition , and then in 2005 it took a fast dive and was full-fledged osteoporosis . Post : People respond to bad news in different ways . Some are fired up , others are reduced to tears . How did you react ? Sally Field : I remember driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons . I tried to make light of it . I said , " Oh , my bones ! I have n't a leg to stand on ! " But in reality I knew it was a sign . A little flag went up and I realized , OK , I 've entered a new stage of life where taking care of my health has to be a real commitment , not something I take for granted anymore . I decided to fight back by getting information . I wanted to know more about osteoporosis . I wanted to know how it could impact me . I wanted to learn how best to take care of myself . What I found out was that one out of two women over the age of 50 will experience an osteoporosls-related fracture at some time in their lives . The good news is that bone is a living thing and the body constantly loses old bone and builds new bone . Osteoporosls occurs when your body loses more bone than it 's capable of building . With treatment , I 'm now back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've remained tiny and fit throughout your career . Did it actually take the osteoporosis diagnosis to make you health conscious ? Sally Field : I 've always been health conscious because I did n't want to gain weight . People say I 'm tiny , but I never felt tiny . I fought the weight issue my whole life . When I was starting out in the business at age 17 or 18 , I knew nothing about nutrition and fitness . Women did n't exercise back then ; it just was n't something that was part of our day . I did n't understand that walking , running , and pumping iron can help maintain weight . I thought you lost weight by eating nothing but cucumbers ! Later , by doing a lot of reading . I learned that 's not a good thing . It 's all about eating right and exercising . Post : How would you describe your diet today ? Sally Field : My diet is insanely healthy . I 've probably moved too far to the other extreme . People tell me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monica and I love working in the garden . I 'm growing greens and vegetables in my back yard . I take my lunch to work . I eat mostly salads ... I make these great big salads . I 'm possessed ! I also include things like soy milk in my diet that I never used to eat . Post : Your current schedule obviously requires a lot of energy . What prompted you to take on the demanding role of Nora in Brothers &; Sisters ? Sally Field : The author , Jon Robin Baitz , is a spectacular writer . I 've been a longtime fan of his plays , and I think it 's interesting that we now have contemporary American playwrights moving to television . Before Brothers &; Sisters came along , my interests were headed toward the theater . But Brothers &; Sisters is all about a dysfunctional family whose members deeply love each other and are bonded together . My whole life is about family . Yes , work is important , but at the heart of everything is family . Post : There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those who came before them . In other words , past generations have cleared the way for the current generation to succeed . On whose shoulders do you stand ? Sally Field : Probably on my mother 's shoulders . As far as actresses go , the generation that I grew up watching was one generation removed from my own . I 've always been a huge fan of movies from the ' ' 30s and ' ' 40s . I watched Rosalind Russell , Irene Dunne , Katharine Hepburn and Bette Davis . I admired them greatly and studied their ability to move from drama and into comedy . Post : You made similar transitions from comedy to drama and back to comedy again . Was that done by chance or design ? Sally Field : I do n't think you can design those things , especially not in my business . The only thing you can do iIs keep getting better . You keep your head up , do things for the right reasons , and always strive to improve . Post : Do you feel any need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've learned ? Have you ever wanted to mentor young talent or write a book about your experiences ? Sally Field : I 've been on the board at Robert Redford 's Sundance Institute for 10 years or so . I work with actors and young directors at the Sundance theater labs all the time in the summer . I guess that 's mentoring , in a way . I have n't taken people under my wing exactly , but I try to hand off whatever information that I have . As far as a book goes , no , not right now ; maybe later in my life . To say I might write a book is like casually announcing , " Well , maybe I 'll climb Mount Everest . " It 's a really difficult task ! I know how hard It is because my oldest son is a novelist ; in fact , all three of my sons are writers , so I do n't take it lightly . Maybe someday ... but not right now . Post ; You 've succeeded in every aspect of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there something out there that you would really like to accomplish ? Sally Field : Right now I 'm excited to be doing Brothers &; Sisters . Beyond that , I really do n't know . I do n't look at life like that . I sort of wait for roads to present themselves . It 's hard to fathom a road before it becomes apparent . I 'm in a good place ; I feel fine , but at the same time , I 'm conscious that life does n't stand still . I 'm trying to move with it , adapt and keep on keeping on . Life is never perfect . It goes up and down , and you have to ride it like a roller coaster . Sidebar Sally launched the osteoporosis awareness campaign last April with the introduction of the www.bonehealth.com website . The numbers have been building since then , with almost 60,000 visitors going to the site for information in its first six months . One of the tips that Sally shares is the importance of building bone mass through the use of free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awareness campaign , Sally Field urges women to take several steps to improve their bone health . Get adequate calcium and vitamin D Studies suggest women over age 50 need 1,200 mg of calcium and 400-600 IU of vitamin D. Because a body best handles about 500 mg of calcium at a time , consume calcium-rich foods or supplements in smaller doses throughout the day , preferably with a meal . Exercise to build strength , flexibility , balance Two types of exercise are important : weight-bearing exercise such as walking , stair climbing , and dancing ; and resistance exercise such as using free weights or weight machines . Exercise also can reduce the risk of falling by improving balance , flexibility , and strength . Follow your doctor 's orders Regular checkups ensure careful monitoring of osteoporosis and bone mineral density . If medication is prescribed , fill the prescription promptly and take it as directed . Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol Smoking interferes with the way the body uses calcium to help bones . Excessive alcohol can reduce bone mass and increase the risk of fracture . Limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Brothers &; Sisters earned rave reviews when the series debated last September . Sally , surrounded here by the show 's ensemble cast , plays the mother of five adult children , including Calista Flockhart . In her personal life Sally has three adult sons-Peter . Eli , and Sam-and three grandchildren . A self-proclaimed " hermit , " Sally lives with her mother in a house high in the hills near the Santa Monica and Malibu areas of California .
