She 's dead ! " <p> Cecil Williams made this announcement from the entrance to the dining room at Ravenscar , the great Elizabethan house in Yorkshire . Then closing the door behind him , he walked across to the table in a few quick strides . It was 1996 , and this news was momentous . <p> Against her own volition , Elizabeth Turner jumped up . " When ? " she asked in a voice full of sudden tension , her eyes riveted on his face . <p> " This morning , very early . Just before dawn , to be exact . " <p> There was a silence . <p> Elizabeth took tight control of a rush of emotion ; even though this news had been long expected , deep down she had not believed she would ever hear those words . She took a moment to absorb them , then said , " There 's nothing much to say , is there , Cecil ? Nothing at all , actually , and anyway , what would be the point ? I 'm not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sister 's death . " <p> " Nor am I. I understand your feelings perfectly , Elizabeth . " He put an arm around her shoulder , kissed her cheek , and drawing back , looked deeply into her luminous gray-black eyes . At once he noticed they were glistening with tears and knew , without a shadow of a doubt , that the tears were not for the deceased woman . They were , in fact , tears of genuine relief . <p> " It 's over , Elizabeth , " he said , very softly . " Finally . Your torment is at an end , and you 're safe , secure . No one can tell you what to do , not ever again . You 're your own woman , and in control of your own destiny . " <p> The tense expression on her pale face instantly lifted , and she exclaimed , " Yes , I am free . Free at last ! Oh , Cecil , how wonderful that thought is ! Yet , do you know , I can hardly grasp it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was immediately gone , as if she was not quite convinced of her new status . <p> He smiled at her . " I believe it 's going to take a few days to sink in . " <p> She looked at him intently , her eyes narrowing slightly . He knew her well , truly understood her , and he was correct , it would take a few days for her to truly believe that everything had changed . She took a moment to steady herself before saying , " I 'm being rude , Cecil . Let me get you some breakfast , you must be famished . Lucas has brought in enough food to feed an army , so what do you fancy ? " <p> " I am hungry , I must admit . But I 'll help myself . Go and sit down , drink your coffee and relax . You have every reason to do so today of all days . " <p> Elizabeth did as he suggested , glad to sit down in the comfortable chair . She was shaking inside and her legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavoring to relax , she experienced instead an unexpected sense of dread . The future loomed up in front of her ; it was an unknown future . Overwhelming . A wave of nausea swept over her at the prospect of leaving her old life behind , grasping her destiny with both hands . All those years of sleepless nights , early risings , often before dawn . Constantly worrying , always fearful , numb with anxiety , forever apprehensive . About her sister . Never knowingnever knowing what tricks Mary would pull , what accusations the woman would level at her . She had been living on the edge , on the edge of danger , living on her nerves for as long as she could remember . Mary had tormented her since childhood . <p> A moment later , Cecil returned with a plate of food and sat down next to her . After eating a few mouthfuls of scrambled eggs , he remarked , " You must have been up when it was still dark outside . I was surprised when I found your door open and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I could n't sleep , so I finally got up . This past week has been , horrendous , and I 'm afraid my feelings did get the better of me . It was the endless waiting and waiting , I suppose . Cancer is unpredictable like that . " <p> He glanced at her , his steady gray eyes searching her face . He had worried about her for years , and he would always worry about her , he was well aware of that . His devotion to her was absolute , and his one thought at the moment was to protect her at all cost . But he made no comment , merely went on calmly eating his breakfast . He was a steady , careful man , and his plans were in place . <p> After finishing her cup of coffee , Elizabeth ran a hand over her mouth and confided , " I never worried about her being ill , you know . I did n't . What was the point ? And , after all , we knew she was dying , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deluded about being pregnant . But last weekwell , I could n't help remembering things from the past . The good things . And the bad . From our girlhood mostlythe time when our father disowned us both . Well , we were close then , if only for a short while . And the rest of the time I spent with her  --  " Elizabeth broke off , shook her head . " The rest of the time was extremely difficult . She was impossible . I was the enemy in her eyes . She was so very possessive of our father . My mother had usurped hers , and I had usurped her , my father , of course , being the great prize , that great bull of a man , to be cozied up to and adored . Unconditionally . She was competitive , and as everyone knows , she always believed I was plotting against her . " Elizabeth let out a long sigh . " No matter what , I was in the wrong with Mary from the day I was born . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . You 're starting a new life this is a new beginning for you , " he said reassuringly . <p> " And I aim to live my new life well , " she answered , mustering a positive tone , and stood up , crossed to the sideboard , poured herself another cup of coffee . A few seconds later , between sips , she asked , " Who knows about Mary 's death ? Everyone , I suppose ? " <p> " Not quite , not yet . " Cecil looked across at the grandfather clock standing in a corner of the dining room . " It 's not yet eight , and it is Sunday , so I 've kept my phone calls to a minimum . For the moment . Nicholas Throckman was the first one to phone , to tell me Mary was dead , and then immediately afterwards I heard from Charles Broakes , who announced the same thing . " <p> Staring at him with a frown , Elizabeth exclaimed , " Your famous mobile ! That 's how everyone got in touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " I asked Nicholas and Charles to call me on the mobile . Why should the whole household be awakened at six in the morning ? " He shook his head . " Like you , I hardly slept last night . I knew she could n't last much longer . " <p> " I assume Nicholas is on his way here . With the black box . " <p> " He is . Actually , he 's had possession of the box since Friday . Mary 's people sent it to him that afternoon , so that he could bring it to you immediately . They thought she was about to die that day , but it was a false alarm . This morning , within half an hour of hearing the news , he set off . He 's driving up here right now , and he asked me to tell you he looks forward to joining us for Sunday lunch . " <p> She smiled for the first time in days . " I 'm glad to hear it . " <p> " Sidney Payne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , but I told him not to , explained we would be in London later in the week and I would be in touch then . He told me three people had called him already , so the news of Mary 's death is spreading fast . " Cecil grimaced . " Everyone loves to gossip , to speculate , so important news spreads like wildfire . " <p> Leaning forward , Elizabeth asked with sudden eagerness , " Who are we inviting to our first meeting ? " <p> " Your great-uncle Howard must be there , your cousins Francis Knowles and Henry Carray , Sidney Payne should come , plus some of the board members who have long been waiting for this day . " <p> She nodded . " I know who they are , and I ca n't wait to see them . But what about those in the company who are against me ? " <p> " What can they do ? " Cecil asked , shaking his head . " Nothing ! They can not challenge you , Elizabeth . You are the rightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " They can torpedo me , work against me , trip me up , do me in , call it what you will . " She shrugged . " They 're Mary 's cronies , and they 'll never like me . They never have . " <p> " Who cares ? Liking you is of no import ! They have to respect you . That 's vital , the only thing that matters . And I 'm going to make damned sure they will . " <p> Mary Turner , her sister , was dead . No , not Mary Turner , but Mary Turner Alvarez , wife of Philip Alvarez , the greatest tycoon in Madrid , a man who had used her money , weakened her resources , then abandoned her to die alone . But that was what men did , was n't it ? Used women , then discarded them . Her father had taken all the prizes for doing just that . Do n't think ill of him now , Elizabeth warned herself . It was his last will and testament that had held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heir . And now Deravenels was hers . <p> Toward the end , Mary had had no alternative but to follow Harry Turner 's wishes . Nonetheless , earlier there had been desperate attempts on her sister 's part to cheat her out of her rightful inheritance . <p> Mary had first named her unborn son , that nonexistent child she fantasized about , the one she thought she carried in her swollen belly , as heir apparent . It was not new life reclining there but an inoperable cancer . <p> After this had come her most brilliant brainstorm , as Mary had called it . Her Spanish husband must inherit . After all , was n't he the most famous businessman in Spain , a seasoned entrepreneur ; and who better than him to run the ancient company ? <p> When this idea was promptly scuttled by those who could scuttle it , Mary had seized on their cousin Marie Stewart , she of Scottish-French descent and upbringing , a woman who was ninety percent French , barely English at all . At the time , Cecil had wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight-hundred-year-old trading company based in London , one that was a male bastion of self-centered chauvinism . Nothing , they had agreed , marveling at Mary Turner 's gall . <p> Marie Stewart had long claimed she was the rightful heir , pointing out that her right to inherit came through her English grandmother , Margaret Turner , elder sister of Harry . But it was Harry who represented the direct male line from his father ; therefore , his offspring , whether male or female , took precedence over his sister Margaret 's line . It all had to do with the rule of primogeniture and the eldest son and his descendants being the true inheritors . <p> Once again , this idea of Mary Turner 's had been swiftly killed . The board of Deravenels wanted nothing to do with Marie Stewart , whom they viewed as the enemy for a variety of reasons . And that would always be their stance . <p> And so at the very end her sister , Mary , had finally acknowledged her , although not actually by name . Something seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had sent a suitcase with one of her assistants . It contained Turner family jewels and a lot of keys , for bank vaults , safes , and various Turner homes . <p> Her wise Cecil had pointed out , " This is her way of acknowledging you , Elizabeth . She is going to fulfill your father 's last will and testament in the end . You 'll see . Her actions are more important than any words she might utter . " <p> But why could n't her sister have said her name ? Why could n't she have said " my sister , my heir Elizabeth Turner " ? Why had she merely muttered something about Harry Turner 's rightful heir ? <p> Because she hated you , Elizabeth now thought , and she could n't bear the idea that you were about to take her place . <p> Let it go , let it go , a small voice said inside her head , and she endeavored to push these thoughts away . What did it matter now ? Mary Turner Alvarez was dead . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to become managing director of Deravenels . It was all hers now . The company , the houses , the jewels , the power , and the wealth . And she wanted it . Who would n't ? Also , it was hers by right . She was a Deravenel and a Turner through and through . She was Harry 's girl , and she looked exactly like him . Mary had n't resembled Harry at all . She had looked like her Spanish mother , but she had also been much smaller than Catherine , somewhat squat and not half as pretty . <p> Moving across the floor of her bedroom , Elizabeth opened the cupboard door , pulled out the suitcase Mary had sent , and carried it to the bed . She found the key in her desk drawer , opened the case , and rummaged around , looking at some of the brown leather pouches , which had engraved silver nameplates stitched on the front . One said " Waverley Court , Kent , " another " Ravenscar , Yorkshire , " a third , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of keys . Then there were pouches pertaining to bank vaults at Coutts , the Westminster Bank , and Lloyd 's , and keys for those vaults . <p> Cecil had told her that these bank vaults contained Deravenel and Turner jewels , other valuables , such as silver objects and tea services , canteens of silver , gold objects , and ancient documents . He had pointed out that she , as the new owner , would have to visit each bank vault when they returned to London , to check on everything . <p> Placing the pouches to one side , Elizabeth smoothed her long fingers over several red leather boxes from Cartier , then opened them all . One contained a superb diamond necklace , the next a pair of extraordinary emerald-cut emerald earrings , and the last a huge sapphire-and diamond pin . It struck her that this jewelry was not only fabulous but obviously from the 1930s , and she could n't help wondering which member of the family had bought such gems . And for whom . She also wondered if she would ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would certainly wear the South Sea pearls she had examined with Cecil the other day . <p> Taking the pearls out of their black-velvet case , she held them up to the light . How lustrous they weretruly lovely . Yes , these she would wear . <p> After returning everything to the suitcase , she locked it and put it back in the cupboard to be dealt with later . There were more pressing things to do in the next few weeks . The bank vaults would have to wait , and so would the two houses , Waverley Court and the house in Chelsea where Mary had lived for some years , and where she had died today . Later this week her sister would be buried in the family cemetery here , at Ravenscar , where all the Deravenels and Turners were buried . There was the funeral to be planned , people to be invited . <p> Elizabeth sat down at her desk , opened her diary , and turned the pages , came to the page for today : Sunday , November 17th , 1996 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister , Mary Turner Alvarez , died at dawn this morning . She was forty-two years old . <p> As she sat back in the chair , staring at the wall , Elizabeth 's mind raced . Going to Deravenels and taking over the running of the company terrified her . But she had no choice . What would she do first ? How would she and Cecil implement her plans ? And his , which were complex ? She had no idea how she would manage . She had worked at Deravenels off and on since she was eighteen , and had grown to love the company until Mary had kicked her out last year . She was about to go back and run it , and she was only twenty-five years old , and basically inexperienced . But she had to do it ; she would just have to manage . Most important , she must succeed . <p> Elizabeth knew one thing  --  she had to prove to those who worked there that she was not like her sister , who had been befuddled , incompetent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Mary 's lousy performance had simply underscored their inherent belief that women were not meant to be executives within that age-old trading company , that place of male supremacy . <p> I have to do it . I do n't have a choice . I must be strong , tough , smart , and if necessary , devious . I have to win . I want to win . And I want Deravenels . I want it all . It was left to me . I must make it great again . <p> Closing her eyes , Elizabeth put her arms on the desk and rested her head on them , her mind still racing , plans evolving in her fertile brain . <p> Excerpted from Being Elizabeth by Barbara Taylor Bradford <p> Copyright 2008 by Beaji Enterprises . <p> Published in 2008 by St. Martin
