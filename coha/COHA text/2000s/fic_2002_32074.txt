For the past eight years , always starting on August twelfth , Ruth Young lost her voice . The first time it happened was when she moved into Art 's flat in San Francisco . For several days , Ruth could only hiss like an untended teakettle . She figured it was a virus , or perhaps allergies to a particular mold in the building . When she lost her voice again , it was on their first anniversary of living together , and Art joked that her laryngitis must be psychosomatic . Ruth wondered whether it was . When she was a child , she lost her voice after breaking her arm . Why was that ? On their second anniversary , she and Art were stargazing in the Grand Tetons . According to a park pamphlet , " During the peak of the Perseids , around August 12th , hundreds of shooting ' or falling ' stars streak the sky every hour . They are actually fragments of meteors penetrating the earth 's atmosphere , burning up in their descent . " Against the velvet blackness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did not actually believe that her laryngitis was star-crossed , or that the meteor shower had anything to do with her inability to speak . Her mother , though , had often told Ruth throughout her childhood that shooting stars were really " melting ghost bodies " and it was bad luck to see them . If you did , that meant a ghost was trying to talk to you . To her mother , just about anything was a sign of ghosts : broken bowls , barking dogs , phone calls with only silence or heavy breathing at the other end . The following August , rather than just wait for muteness to strike , Ruth explained toher clients and friends that she was taking a planned weeklong retreat into verbal silence . " It 's a yearly ritual , " she said , " to sharpen my consciousness about words and their necessity . " One of her book clients , a New Age psychotherapist , saw voluntary silence as a " wonderful process , " and decided he would engage in the same so they could include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or stillness as therapy . From then on , Ruth 's malady was elevated to an annual sanctioned event . She stopped talking two days before her voice faded of its own accord . She politely declined Art 's offer that they both try speaking in sign language . She made her voiceless state a decision , a matter of will , and not a disease or a mystery . In fact , she came to enjoy her respite from talk , for a whole week she did not need to console clients , remind Art about social schedules , warn his daughters to be careful , or feel guilty for not calling her mother . This was the ninth year . Ruth , Art , and the girls had driven the two hundred miles to Lake Tahoe for the Days of No Talk , as they called them . Ruth had envisioned the four of them holding hands and walking down to the Truckee River to watch the nightly meteor showers in quiet awe . But the mosquitoes were working overtime , and Dory whimpered that she saw a bat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabies when the forest is full of ax murderers ? " After they fled back to the cabin , the girls said they were bored . " There 's no cable television ? " they complained . So Art drove them to Tahoe City and rented videos , mainly horror flicks . He and the girls slept through most of them , and though Ruth hated the movies , she could not stop watching . She dreamed of deranged babysitters and oozing aliens . On Sunday , when they returned home to San Francisco , cranky and sweaty , they discovered they had no hot water . The tank had leaked , and the heating element apparently had fried to death . They were forced to make do with kettle-warmed baths ; Art did n't want to be gouged by emergency plumbing rates . Without a voice , Ruth could n't argue , and she was glad . To argue would mean she was offering to foot the bill , something she had done so often over their years of living together that it had become expected of her . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then irked that Ark said nothing further about the matter . At bedtime he nuzzled her neck and bumped gently into her backside . When she tensed , he said , " Suit yourself , " and rolled over , and this left her feeling rebuffed . She wanted to explain what was wrongbut she realized she did not know . There was nothing specific beyond her bad mood . Soon Art 's sonorous breathing rumbled , out of sync with her frustration , and she lay wide-eyed in the dark . It was now nearly midnight , and in another few hours , Ruth would be able to talk . She stood in the Cubbyhole , a former pantry that served as her home office . She stepped onto a footstool and pushed open a tiny window . There it was , a sliver of a million-dollar view : the red towers of the Golden Gate Bridge that bifurcated the waters , marking bay from ocean . The air was moist and antiseptically cold against her face . She scanned the sky , but it was too light and misty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foghorns started to blare . And after another minute , Ruth saw the billows , like an ethereal down comforter covering the ocean and edging toward the bridge . Her mother used to tell her that the fog was really the steam from fighting dragons , one water , the other fire . " Water and fire , come together make steam , " LuLing would say in the strangely British-accented English she had acquired in Hong Kong . " You know this . Just like teapot . You touch , burn your finger off . " The fog was sweeping over the ramparts of the bridge , devouring the headlamps of cars . Nine out of ten drivers were drunk at this hourRuth had read that somewhere . Or maybe she had written that for a client . She stepped down , but left the window open . The foghorns continued to wail . They sounded like tubas in a Shostakovich opera , comedically tragic . But was tragedy ever funny ? Or was it only the audience who laughed knowingly as the victims walked into trapdoors and trick mirrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just then she felt a tug of worry , something she was not supposed to forget . Did it have to do with money , a client , or a promise she had made to the girls ? She set to straightening her desk , aligning her research books , sorting faxes and drafts , color-coding them according to client and book . Tomorrow she had to return to routine and deadlines , and a clean desk gave her the sense of a fresh start , an uncluttered mind . Everything had its place . If an item was of questionable priority or value , she dumped it in the bottom right-hand drawer of her desk . But now the drawer was full with unanswered letters , abandoned drafts , sheets of jotted-down ideas that might be usable in the future . She pulled out a clipped stack of paper from the bottom of the drawer , guessing she could toss out whatever had lain there the longest by neglect . They were pages written in Chinese , her mother 's writing . LuLing had given them to her five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about my family , " she had said , with the kind of awkward nonchalance that meant the pages were important . " My story , begin little-gift time . I write for myself , but maybe you read , then you see how I grow up , come to this country . " Ruth had heard bits of her mother 's life over the years , but she was touched by her shyness in asking Ruth to read what she had obviously labored over . The pages contained precise vertical rows , without cross-outs , leaving Ruth to surmise that her mother had copied over her earlier attempts . Ruth had tried to decipher the pages . Her mother had once drilled Chinese calligraphy into her reluctant brain , and she still recognized some of the characters : " thing , " I " " truth . " But unraveling the rest required her to match LuLing 's squiggly radicals to uniform ones in a Chinese-English dictionary . " These are the things I know are true , " the first sentence read . That had taken Ruth an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence a day . And in keeping with her plan , she translated another sentence the next evening : " My name is LuLing Liu Young . " That was easy , a mere five minutes . Then came the names of LuLing 's husbands , one of whom was Ruth 's father . Husbands ? Ruth was startled to read that there had been another . And what did her mother mean by " our secrets gone with them ? " Ruth wanted to know right away , but she could not ask her mother . She knew from experience what happened whenever she asked her mother to render Chinese characters into English . First LuLing scolded her for not studying Chinese hard enough when she was little . And then , to untangle each character , her mother took side routes to her past , going into excruciating detail over the infinite meanings of Chinese words : " Secret not just mean can not say . Can be hurt-you kinda secret , or curse-you kind , maybe do you damage forever , never can change after that .... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without saying what the secret itself was , followed by more rambling about how the person had died horribly , why this had happened , how it could have been avoided , if only such-and-such had not occurred a thousand years before . If Ruth showed impatience in listening to any of this , LuLing became outraged , before sputtering an oath that none of this mattered because soon she too would die anyway , by accident , because of bad-luck wishes , or on purpose . And then the silent treatment began , a punishment that lasted for days or weeks , until Ruth broke down first and said she was sorry . So Ruth did not ask her mother . She decided instead to set aside several days when she could concentrate on the translation . She told her mother this , and LuLing warned , " Do n't wait too long . " After that , whenever her mother asked whether she had finished her story , Ruth answered , " I was just about to , but something came up with a client . " Other crises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls , or the house , as did vacation . " Too busy for mother , " LuLing complained . " Never too busy go see movie , go away , go see friend . " The past year , her mother had stopped asking , and Ruth wondered , Did she give up ? Could n't be . She must have forgotten . By then the pages had settled to the bottom of the desk drawer . Now that they had resurfaced , Ruth felt pangs of guilt . Perhaps she should hire someone fluent in Chinese . Art might know of someonea linguistics student , a retired professor old enough to be versed in the traditional characters and not just the simplified ones . As soon as she had time , she would ask . She placed the pages at the top of the heap , then closed the drawing , feeling less guilty already . When she woke in the morning , Art was up , doing his yoga stretches in the next room . " Hello , " she said to herself . " Is anyone there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disuse . As she brushed her teeth in the bathroom , she could hear Dory screeching : " I want to watch that . Put it back ! It 's my TV too . " Fia hooted : " That show 's for babies , and that 's what you are , wnnh-wnnh-wnnh . " Since Art 's divorce , the girls had been dividing their time between their mom and stepdad 's home in Sausalito and Art 's Edwardian flat on Vallejo Street . Every other week , the four of themArt , Ruth , Sofia , and Doryfound themselves crammed into five miniature rooms , one of them barely big enough to squeeze in a bunkbed . There was only one bathroom , which Ruth hated for its antiquated inconvenience . The clawfooted iron tub was as soothing as a sarcophagus , and the pedestal sink with its separate spigots dispensed water that was either scalding hot or icy cold . As Ruth reached for the dental floss , she knocked over other items on the windowsill : potions for wrinkles , remedies for pimples , nose-hair clippers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vintage were always in question . While she was picking up the mess , desperate pounding rattled the door . " You 'll have to wait , " she called in a husky voice . The pounding continued . She looked at the bathroom schedule for August , which was posted on both sides of the door . There it said , clear as could be , whose turn it was at each quarter-hour . She had assigned herself to be last , and because everyone else ran late , she suffered the cumulative consequences . Below the schedule , the girls had added rules and amendments , and a list of violations and fines for infractions concerning the use of the sink , toilet , and shower , as well as a proclamation on what constituted the right to privacy versus a TRUE EMERGENCY ( underlined three times ) . The pounding came again . " Ru-uuth ! I said it 's the phone ! " Dory opened the door a crack and shoved in a cordless handset . Who was calling at seven-twenty in the morning ? Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis whenever Ruth had not called in several days . " Ruthie , is your voice back ? Can you talk ? " It was Wendy , her best friend . They spoke nearly every day . She heard Wendy blow her nose . Was she actually crying ? " What happened ? " Ruth whispered . Do n't tell me , do n't tell me , she mouthed in rhythm to her racing heart . Wendy was about to tell her she had cancer , Ruth was sure of it . Last night 's uneasy feeling started to trickle through her veins . " I 'm still in shock , " Wendy went on . " I 'm about to ... Hold on . I just got another call . " It must not be cancer , Ruth thought . Maybe she was mugged , or thieves had broken into the house , and now the police were calling to take a report . Whatever it was , it must have been serious , otherwise Wendy would not be crying . What should she say to her ? Ruth crooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her closecropped hair . She noticed that some of the mirror 's silver had flaked off . Or were those white roots in her hair ? She would soon turn forty-six . When had the baby fat in her face started to recede ? To think she used to resent having the face and skin of a perpetual teenager . Now she had creases pulling down the corners of her mouth . They made her look displeased , like her mother . Ruth brightened her mouth with lipstick . Of course , she was n't like her mother in other respects , thank God . Her mother was permanently unhappy with everything and everybody . LuLing had immersed her in a climate of unsolvable despair throughout Ruth 's childhood . That was why Ruth hated it whenever she and Art argued . She tried hard not to get angry . But sometimes she reached a breaking point and erupted , only to wonder later how she had lost control . Wendy came back on the line . " You still there ? Sorry . We 're casting victims for that earthquake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . Wendy ran her own agency that hunted extras as San Francisco local colorcops with handlebar mustaches , six-foot-six drag queens , socialites who were unknowing caricatures of themselves . " On top of everything , I feel like shit , " Wendy said , and stopped to sneeze and blow her nose . So she was n't crying , Ruth realized , before the phone clicked twice . " Damn , " Wendy said . " Hang on . Let me get rid of this call . " Ruth disliked being put on hold . What was so dire that Wendy had to tell her first thing in the morning ? Had Wendy 's husband had an affair ? Joe ? Not good old Joe . What , then ? Art ducked his head through the doorway and tapped his watch . Seven twenty-five , he mouthed . Ruth was about to tell him it was Wendy with an emergency , but he was already striding down the narrow hallway . " Dory ! Fia ! Let 's hustle ! Ruth is taking you to the ice rink in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls squealed , and Ruth felt like a horse at the starting gate . " I 'll be there in a sec ! " she called out . " And girls , if you did n't eat breakfast , I want you to drink milk , a full glass , so you wo n't fall over dead from hypoglycemic shock . " " Do n't say dead . ' " Dory griped . " I hate it when you say that . " " My God . What 's going on there ? " Wendy was back on the line . " The usual start of the week , " Ruth said . " Chaos is the penance for leisure . " " Yeah , who said that ? " " I did . So anyway , you were saying ? ... " " Promise me first you wo n't tell anyone , " Wendy sneezed again . " Of course . " " Not even Art , and especially not Miss Giddy . " " Gideon ? Gee , I do n't know if I can promise about him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " my mother called in a state of euphoria . " As Wendy went on , Ruth dashed to the bedroom to finish getting dressed . When she was not in a hurry , she enjoyed listening to her friend 's ramblings . Wendy was a divining rod for strange disturbances in the earth 's atmosphere . She was witness to bizarre sights : three homeless albinos living in Golden Gate Park , a BMW suddenly swallowed up by an ancient septic tank in Woodside , a loose buffalo strolling down Taraval Street . She was the maven of parties that led people to make scenes , start affairs , and commit other self-renewing scandals . Ruth believed Wendy made her life more sparkly , but today was not a good time for sparkles . " Ruth ! " Art said in a warning tone . " The girls are going to be late . " " I 'm really sorry , Wendy . I have to take the girls to ice-skating school " Wendy interrupted . " Mommy married her personal trainer ! That 's what she called to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you believe it ? " " Oh ... Wow . " Ruth was stunned . She pictured Mrs. Scott with a groom in a bow tie and gym shorts , the two of them reciting vows on a treadmill . Was Wendy upset ? She wanted to say the right thing . What , though ? About five years before , her own mother had had a boyfriend of sorts , but he had been eighty . Ruth had hoped T.C. would marry LuLing and keep her occupied . Instead T.C. had died of a heart attack . " Listen , Wendy , I know this is important , so can I call you back after I drop off the girls ? " Once she had hung up , Ruth reminded herself of the tasks she needed to do today . Ten things , and she tapped first her thumb . One , take the girls to skating school . Two , pick up Art 's suits at the dry cleaner 's . Three , buy groceries for dinner . Four , pick up the girls from the rink and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street . Five and Six , phone calls to that arrogant client , Ted , then Agapi Aguos , whom she actually liked . Seven , finish the outline for a chapter of Agapi Agnos 's book . Eight , call her agent , Gideon , whom Wendy disliked . And Ninewhat the hell was Nine ? She knew what Ten was , the last task of the day . She had to call Miriam , Art 's ex-wife , to ask if she would let them have the girls the weekend of the Full Moon Festival dinner , the annual reunion of the Youngs , which she was hosting this year . So what was Nine ? She always organized her day by the number of digits on her hands . Each day was either a five or a ten . She was n't rigid about it : add-ons were accommodated on the toes of her feet , room for ten unexpected tasks . Nine , Nine ... She could make calling Wendy number One and bump everything back . But she knew that call should be a toe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nine was usually something important , a significant number , what her mother termed the number of fullness , a number that also stood for Do not forget , or risk losing all . Did Nine have something to do with her mother ? There was always something to worry about with her mother . That was not anything she had to remember in particular . It was a state of mind . LuLing was the one who had taught her to count fingers as a memory device . With this method , LuLing never forgot a thing , especially lies , betrayals , and all the bad deeds Ruth had done since she was born . Ruth could still picture her mother counting in the Chinese style , pointing first to her baby finger and bending each finger down toward her palm , a motion that Ruth took to mean that all other possibilities and escape routes were closed . Ruth kept her own fingers open and splayed , American style . What was Nine ? She put on a pair of sturdy sandals . Art appeared at the doorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plumber about the hot-water tank . " The plumber was not going to be number Nine , Ruth told herself , absolutely not . " Sorry , honey , but could you call ? I 've got a pretty full day . " " I have meetings , and three appeals coming up . " Art worked as a linguistics consultant , this year on cases involving deaf prisoners who had been arrested and tried without access to interpreters . It 's your house , Ruth was tempted to say . But she forced herself to sound reasonable , unassailable , like Art . " Ca n't you call from your office in between meetings ? " " Then I have to phone you and figure out when you 'll be here for the plumber . " " I do n't know exactly when I 'll be home . And you know those guys . They say they 're coming at one , they show up at five . Just because I work at home does n't mean I do n't have a real job . I 've got a really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " And she started to list her tasks . Art slumped his shoulders and sighed . " Why do you have to make everything so difficult ? I just thought if it were possible , if you had timeAw , forget it . " He turned away . " Okay , okay , I 'll take care of it . But if you get out of your meetings early , can you come home ? " " Sure thing . " Art gave her a kiss on the forehead . " Hey , thanks . I would n't have asked if I were n't completely swamped . " He kissed her again . " Love you . " ( Continues ... )
