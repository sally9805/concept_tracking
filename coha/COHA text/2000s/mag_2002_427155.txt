The icy air smells of pine , the powdery ground glistens , and the skiing is the year 's best-but back at the lodge , body-and-soul-warming comforts are calling . So head home and refuel with hot chocolate , some fresh fruit , and fireside sweets until the mittens and socks are dry .

Little has changed since our last winter weekend getaway-whether two or 20 years have passed-and , truth be told , we 'd be disappointed if it had . Be it ever so humble , the mountain lodge invites us to linger after a long , cold day of fun and sport in a retreat filled with the core comforts : a bright fire , warm food and drink , and a soft place to revive winter-wearied bodies . Caps , mittens , and kneesocks are hung to dry , and spare blankets and quilts are retrieved from closets and put to work deflecting drafts . As a dusty deck of cards is brushed off , a friendly game forms around the table . Nearby , fellow skiers stretch out in front of the fire , thawing frozen toes as they watch the flames and listen to the firewood crackle and pop . The urge to hibernate settles in early , and by nine , lights go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all your buying needs his shopping guide provides our readers with further details and an index of manufacturers , antiques dealers , and stores where merchandise featured in Country Living can be obtained .
