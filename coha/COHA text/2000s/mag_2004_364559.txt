In the boardroom at DC Comics , a life-size statue of Clark Kent sits in a chair reading the Daily Planet . Lately the talk is probably making him a little nervous . Superman is still the company 's flagship icon , but Batman outsells him , and the original superhero has n't starred in a movie for 17 years . But help may be on the way . DC is installing new creative talent on all three main monthly Superman comics , starting with the June issues . " Periodically there 's just a moment that happens when a new generation of talent steps in , and you get some fresh points of view , " says Paul Levitz , president and publisher of DC , which , like this magazine , is owned by Time Warner . In other words , the Man of Steel is getting a makeover . Now , how do you improve a guy who has super-everything ? <P> For America 's multimillion-dollar Superman industry , it 's a serious problem . This is a guy who 's from outer space  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not forget  --  but he 's also from another time . He debuted in the 1930s , when Americans liked their heroes like they liked their steaks : tough , thick and all-American . Nowadays we prefer our heroes dark and flawed and tragic . Look at the Punisher ( wife and kids dead ) , or Hellboy ( born a demon ) , or Spider-Man ( secretly a nerd ) . Look at Batman : his parents were killed in front of him , and he dresses like a Cure fan . Now look at the big blue Boy Scout , with his cleft chin and his spit curl . He 's just not cool . <P> Jim Lee , who 's taking over the art on Superman , is fresh from a run on best-selling Batman , so he 's in touch with his dark side . But he admits it 's a challenge . " Batman is a more modern-era type character , " Lee says . " He 's fueled by vengeance ; he 's the boogeyman . Superman is the altruistic alien hero that protects us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this day and age . " In their first issue , Lee and writer Brian Azzarello have <P> Superman in a church pouring out his heart to a priest . While Superman 's back was turned , a million people vanished from earth , including Lois Lane , and he 's powerless to do anything about it . He 's a brooding , angry , heavily shadowed Superman , riddled with self-doubt . " For the first time , I was really afraid , " he says . " Lost , without my rhythm . " You get through the entire issue before you realize not a single punch has been thrown . <P> When writer Chuck Austen got handed Action Comics , another Superman monthly , he knew punches would be thrown , what with the title and all . But Superman is on the receiving end for a change . " As someone who loved the dark side for a long time , I had little or no interest in Superman for years , " Austen says . " He was perfect  --  his powers left him with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  make him a bit less powerful , a lot more vulnerable physically . " Austen 's Superman can take a joke as well as a punch . He rags on his sparring partners for their lame trash talk : " What 's next ? ' Mindless cretin ! ' Or ' Had enough ? ' Or my personal favorite  --  ' No one can stand before the might of  --  ( your name here ) . " The tone is light and fresh and surprisingly funny . " Much of it is the fun of playing against his type , " says Austen . " But much more of it is , without question , to upgrade him a bit . He 's the greatest superhero ever created ! He needs to be cool ! "
