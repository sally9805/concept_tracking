Section : Outlook 2002 ; Cover Story ; Special Report ; Introduction 2001 was a year no one will forget  --  a year of horror and pain . But the rebuilding is already well underway <p> You 'd expect a priest at Ground Zero to weep at the unspeakable horrors of September 11 and wonder how a nation can cope with such sorrow . Instead , the Rev. Kevin Madigan is eager to move forward . He ca n't wait to stop wrangling with contractors who will repair St. Joseph 's Chapel , damaged when it was taken over by disaster relief specialists , and repaint the ash-stained walls of St. Peter 's Church ( " My New York suspicions are that you ca n't trust anybody , " he confesses with a wink ) . He wants to see new buildings that will bring life back to the financial district . And he 's tired of talking about what happened . Asked his plans for the new year , he says , " I want to get out of here for a week , hopefully to Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the World Trade Center . " <p> Father Madigan is the epitome of America 's restless , optimistic spirit . Instead of fixating on the past , the nation is moving ahead , slowly but surely . " One of the reasons we 've been able to be forward looking is we have n't seen ourselves as victims , " offers Holocaust scholar James Young . <p> The rebirth of a shocked nation is evident at ground zero . A little more than three months after that awful day in September , workers used blowtorches and cables to topple the last standing wall of the World Trade Center . The 16 acres where the twin towers once stood now throb with bulldozers , cranes , and workers who toil 24 hours a day , hauling off tons of rubble and searching painstakingly for bodies . Huge klieg lights shine over the hallowed ground in the dark of the night , casting an eerie blue glow . Mourners and onlookers watch with hushed fascination . But local politicians have a practical concern . The cleanup is going so fast they fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handout  --  it does n't look that bad . <p> People from all walks of life are starting to rebuild . As painful as it is , they are learning to live without a husband , a wife , a parent , a child . They are seeking new ways to ward off terror and keep the country safe . They are striving to revive the battered economy . And half a world away , they are committed to resurrecting the devastated land of Afghanistan . <p> This special issue of U.S. News looks at the questions that loom ahead and showcases some of the rebuilders who are healing the wounds of September 11 . These stories serve to remind us that , even in times of great uncertainty , life must go on . On the Road Again <p> Movement , always movement . Few things say more about America 's spirit than its constant restlessness . Americans are ever on the go , ever casting their gaze to the far horizon . The pull of the vast landscape , the promise of that big new job keep millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a terrifying moment , this year . The kamikaze planes on that balmy September morning stopped us in our tracks . But just for a spell . And as shock yielded to anger , and then resolve , one could , literally , hear the pace of the nation pick up . There were more of us in the streets . The empty public places  --  stores and sports arenas  --  soon brimmed and buzzed . <p> A nation so wounded , however , does not soon forget . Or forgive . And so the fight is being carried now to the far hills of foreign lands and then , next year , beyond . But a sure measure that the home front is already serious about healing is the movement . Although 8 million Americans say the terrorist attacks made them cancel plans to travel during the holidays , 39 million strong will hit the road . In Livingston , Mont. , a parting kiss before boarding the big Greyhound . And , then , time to go  --  to go on about the business of living . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the nation . The paralysis had yielded to a more vigorous step . The grief , palpably still there , was n't quite so raw . But there they were suddenly  --  the trees , the trappings . And so a nation wounded found its way toward joy , again . In Philadelphia , a tone-true Santa made music for the holidays . In Toledo , Ohio , Muslims hugged at the end of Ramadan . Kids in Flint , Mich. , rehearsed for the Christmas show at St. Nicholas Orthodox Church . Calamity 's calendar <p> The September attacks could hardly have been more jarring , but the mad tumble of events in the aftermath almost defied comprehension . America 's first war of the new millennium included an old-fashioned horseback cavalry charge and seemed to end , in the year 's waning days , with a treacherous scramble through ancient caves . In a cafe in Miles City , Mont. , a customer keeps up with the news . Heart and soul <p> In New York , or on the other side of the country , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of a nation rallied . In the Rockaways , home to many of the firefighters killed in the World Trade Center , flags flew from cars and front porches . A photo shop owner in Montana wove local students ' portraits into a flag to show community support for the firefighters and cops , and for the victims and their families . Freedom 's fight <p> It will be a war like no other , President Bush warns us . The battle will be waged at home and abroad , and the nation must be prepared for the long haul . But in a sense , the president 's campaign against terror is no different from many of the nation 's past wars . The struggle is premised on principle , a contest with evil , an embrace of liberty . And a true grasp of the meaning of freedom . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p>
