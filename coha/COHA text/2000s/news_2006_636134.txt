<p> The Cubs ' season has been a succession of failed key moments , ninth-inning collapses , injuries and lost opportunities . <p> But one more notch on the handle of futility was etched Sunday night when the New York Mets slugged two grand slams in one inning off Cubs pitching . That was a first in the 130-year saga of the franchise . <p> No wonder manager Dusty Baker threw up his hands in disbelief over the disaster that was the Mets ' 11-run sixth inning and their eventual 13-7 victory at Wrigley Field . <p> " A total nightmare , " Baker said . " And we gave them too many outs . A team like that with the way they can score runs , you ca n't give them outs . " <p> The inning that began with the Cubs and lefty Sean Marshall leading 5-2 ended after 16 Mets batted their way into history , with two errors by second baseman Todd Walker adding to the carnage . <p> The grand slams  --  by Cliff Floyd off Marshall and Carlos Beltran off Roberto Novoa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - The 11 runs were the most ever scored by the Mets in an inning , exceeding the 10 they scored in the eighth inning June 30 , 2000 , against the Atlanta Braves . <p> - The 11 runs were the most allowed in an inning by Cubs pitching since the third inning of a Sept. 6 , 2002 , game in St. Louis when the Cardinals also scored 11 . <p> - The last time a team had two grand slams in one inning in the majors occurred April 23 , 1999 , when Fernando Tatis hit both for the Cardinals in the third inning in Los Angeles against the Dodgers . <p> - It was the fifth time in Cubs history the team has allowed two grand slams in a game , but never before in one inning . <p> The 40,157 fans , who had cheered the first five innings when Marshall ( 5-8 ) dominated on the mound and helped the offense with his first career home run , changed to a jeering throng . Some in the bleachers tossed debris onto the field after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sixth inning , a two-run drive off Novoa . <p> Grounds-crew members swept up the debris as Novoa exited having retired only one batter and giving up six runs . Left-hander Will Ohman finally ended the inning after walking two . <p> The damage might not have been of mammoth proportions but for a pair of errors by Walker , who bobbled a ground ball off Beltran 's bat with one out . Walker later dropped a throw from third baseman Aramis Ramirez on what could have been an inning-ending double play ball by Ramon Castro , which would have stopped the damage at four runs . Instead , nine more Mets batted . <p> " When a teammate struggles , it hurts all of us to see , " catcher Michael Barrett said of Walker , who blamed himself for the sixth-inning debacle . " We do everything we can to pick each other up . The Mets have a good team , and they hurt us . " <p> Until the sixth , Marshall was in control , striking out four and walking none , with only solo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . <p> " Sean did a great job and was throwing the ball well , " Baker said . " The grand slam Floyd hit on a 1-2 pitch ... he comes into the came hitting .170 against lefties , and then he hits two home runs off Sean . " <p> Buried in the avalanche of Mets runs was a night of 15 hits by the Cubs , including homers from Marshall and pinch hitter Phil Nevin , whose two-run shot in the seventh was the sixth pinch-hit homer of his career . Juan Pierre went 4-for-5 with two stolen bases , Barrett was 3-for-5 with two doubles and Marshall also had a single . <p> " It was a frustrating game and frustrating loss , " Barrett said . " A quality start for Marshall two runs on four hits before the sixth , then it just got away from us . That 's the first time I 've ever seen two grand slams in one inning . That 's eight runs right there . <p> " I 've said all year , and again , you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CUBS recap <p> New York AB R H BI BB SO Avg . <p> Valentin 2b 6 1 1 0 0 0 .284 <p> Woodward ss 5 2 2 1 0 0 .236 <p> Beltran cf 4 2 1 4 0 0 .276 <p> Bradford p 0 0 0 0 0 0  --  <p> Heilman p 0 0 0 0 0 0  --  <p> d-JuFranco ph 1 0 0 0 0 1 .275 <p> HBell p 0 0 0 0 0 0 .000 <p> DSanchez p 0 0 0 0 0 0 .000 <p> CDelgado 1b 4 2 2 0 1 0 .252 <p> Wright 3b 5 2 3 2 0 1 .319 <p> CFloyd lf 4 2 2 5 1 0 .256 <p> Nady rf 3 1 1 0 2 1 .260 <p> RCastro c 5 0 1 0 0 1 .252 <p> OHernandez p 0 0 0 0 0 0 .167 <p> Oliver p 1 0 0 0 0 1 .182 <p> a-Marrero ph 1 0 0 0 0 1 .218 <p> Feliciano p 0 0 0 0 0 0 .000 <p> b-Chavez ph-cf 3 1 1 1 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> CUBS AB R H BI BB SO Avg . <p> Pierre cf 5 2 4 0 0 0 .278 <p> TWalker 2b 5 0 0 0 0 1 .285 <p> Barrett c 5 2 3 2 0 1 .329 <p> ARamirez 3b 5 0 2 1 0 1 .263 <p> JJones rf 5 0 1 1 0 0 .300 <p> Mabry 1b 3 0 1 0 2 1 .217 <p> Murton lf 4 0 0 0 1 2 .277 <p> Cedeno ss 4 1 1 0 1 2 .255 <p> Marshall p 3 1 2 1 0 1 .167 <p> Novoa p 0 0 0 0 0 0 .250 <p> Ohman p 0 0 0 0 0 0 1.000 <p> c-Nevin ph 1 1 1 2 0 0 .247 <p> Rusch p 0 0 0 0 0 0 .250 <p> e-Pagan ph 1 0 0 0 0 1 .261 <p> Totals 41 7 15 7 4 10 <p> New York 000 11(11) 000  --  13 14 0 <p> CUBS 230 00 0 200  --  7 15 2 <p> a-struck out for Oliver in the 5th. b-singled for Feliciano in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heilman in the 8th. e-struck out for Rusch in the 9th . <p> E  --  TWalker 2 ( 6 ) .
