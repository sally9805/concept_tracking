The Timbisha Shoshone called it Tomesha , " The Flaming Land , " and to most hikers , Death Valley still conjures images of sun-baked salt flats , crusty prospectors , and skeletons lying face down under a white-hot orb . But this national park harbors a refreshing secret : The blazing sands are surrounded by four rarely traveled ranges-the Cottonwoods , Grapevines , Panamints , and Funerals . High in these steep , gorge-cut mountains , you can find shady slot canyons , breezy passes , and crystal-clear vistas . Most of this extreme landscape is nameless , trail-less , and waterless . But what it lacks in convenience it more than makes up for in scenery and challenge . What follows are the best treks we uncovered in a month of scouting , plus GPS-enabled maps to make the route finding easier .

Stock up in Las Vegas ( 2 hours ) on food , fuel , water , sunscreen , and USGS topos . Weather In Death Valley , you work with the seasons , because you ca n't work against them . Summer temps hit 115F , and winter windstorms rage hard enough to pit windshields . As Ed Abbey put it , " Here , they separate the desert rats from the mice . " Spring and fall are prime time for mountain travel . Cautions Deal with the lack of water by building hikes around water caches-or just carrying a lot of it ( 6 liters a day ) . Beware of flash floods during thunderstorms . Use caution when scrambling ; the rock is rotten . Watch the ground ; sidewinders abound in the washes .

They 're often found near dry lakebeds and along the Amargosa River Valley . The points are actually the tips of atlatl darts , hybrid spear-arrows propelled from a throwing stick . The nomadic culture that made them also left behind woven baskets , sandals , and petroglyphs , but little in the way of ruins . Their descendants , the Timbisha " Red Rock Face Paint " Shoshone , were hunter-gatherers who employed a no-nonsense survival strategy : They headed to the mountains every summer . Now the Timbisha may become players in Death Valley tourism .

Cursed with gross skin deformities , long-fingered hands , and a hunched stride , these creatures supposedly hide in mine shafts to protect their lightsensitive skin . Modern mythmakers link the mutations to radioactive fallout from the nearby Nevada Nuclear Test Site . Older stories , like prospector Bourke Lee 's 1932 report of his interview with a Paiute elder , describe encounters with flying saucer people inhabiting caverns in the high Panamints . One Tough Minnow A few of Lake Manly 's hardier descendants survive to this day , led by more than 20 populations of pupfish . Due to their long isolation in miniscule mineral springs , these chubby minnows diverged into 10 distinct subspecies , some bland , others colorful . They inhabit the most stressful " freshwater " environments on Earth ; water temperatures range from 320F to 1130F and fluctuate as much as 450F in a day . Salt content varies from negligible to more than twice that of seawater . And on hot days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per million . Singing Dunes For centuries , explorers and naturalists have described strange humming and booming sounds emanating from sand dunes disturbed by foot traffic or sandslides . Marco Polo described them on a journey through the Gobi Desert , and Charles Darwin noted them in Chile . If you hear noises in Death Valley ( best chance : Eureka Dunes ) , credit a natural phenomenon Western science discovered in 1832 , and the Chinese knew as early as 880 A.D. It goes something like this : Low frequency sounds occur when dry , closely packed sand grains slide over each other . The stationary sand underneath acts like a guitar backboard , amplifying the volume . Sand must be very dry to sing , with grains that are more rounded and polished than average . Singing dunes are found in China , the Sahara , the Middle East , South Africa , Chile , BaJa California , Hawaii , Nevada , and Death Valley .

Moonlight Canyon contains a difficult mile-long narrows with multiple pour-over rappels . From the base of the final pour-over , it 's 7 miles to Scotty 's Castle Road .

The dunes are a highlight of the remote Eureka Valley in the park 's northwest corner . Only 3 miles long , they 're a biological universe unto themselves , as you 'll discover on this otherworldly loop . The environment here is so isolated , it 's spawned five beetle and three plant species found nowhere else on Earth .

You 'll see an obvious gully arrowing straight up to the east ridge , but take the craggier gulch to its left . This steep climb leads to the east ridge of Pyramid , over three false summits , and along a loose talus ridgeline to the final peak . TELESCOPE PEAK Cool off up high The panorama from 11,049-foot Telescope Peak takes in the Lower 48 's highest ( Mt . Whitney ) and lowest ( Badwater ) points . Reach the park 's highest point with a 7-mile , 3,000-foot climb from Mahogany Flat Campground on Wildrose Canyon Road , following forested ridgelines to the summit . Depending on your vehicle , you may have to park at the Charcoal Kilns , adding 2 miles to the 14-mile round-trip . You can camp anywhere from Arcane Meadows ( mile 2.3 ) on . Water is occasionally available near the saddle between Bennett and Telescope Peaks , via a 1-mile spur trail leading west to Eagle Spring . Telescope Peak is strenuous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Death Valley 's few developed trails . The ridgeline sits high in the jetstream , so take warm clothes and windproof layers , if afternoon thunderheads build , descend quickly . BIGHORNGORGE Hike with wild sheep You might spot this canyon 's sheepish namesake during a 16-mile out-and-back up this rocky cleft of the Cottonwood Mountains .
