It 's truly spring when those last white drifts go technicolor <p> Microbiologist Brian Duval hates this part , so let 's just deal with the snickering up front . Yes , he studies yellow snow . <p> He also studies red , green , and orange snow and would love to examine other colors if he were lucky enough to discover them . His palette comes from springtime blooms of algae that live only in deep , persistent snowfields . <p> And yes , even a professional sometimes gets fooled . <p> " I was outside a penguin rookery in Antarctica , and I thought I was collecting this greenish-yellow algae , " recalls the microbiologist now at the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection in Worcester . " I was saying , ' Yeah , yeah , this looks like the stuff . ' " When he checked his treasures under a microscope , however , he diagnosed the obvious nonalgal origin . " It gets embarrassing , " he admits . <p> Despite the yellow-snow raillery , Duval and his colleagues stay with their studies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Somehow the 350 species of snow algae thrive in the near-freezing , nutrient-poor , acidic , sun-blasted slush of melting snowfields around the world . The algae support a food web in the snow-a world of tiny , wormy , crawly beings as odd as Spielberg-movie creatures . <p> Algal life cycles combine the drama of salmon runs and the nightmare of icebound explorers . Snow-algae chemistry captivates biologists musing about life on other planets or prospecting for novelties on our own . These flashy algae are on their way to becoming glamour species in what Duval and like-minded specialists see as the dawning of a great era of snow ecology . <p> Plus , snow algae can be gorgeous . In high Western snowfields , they blush red in footstep-size patches and meters-long streaks that hikers call watermelon snow . In northern New England , they give salmon-orange sunset streaks to the last mounds of snow at the season 's end . <p> Fie on snickering . Such wonders deserve awe . <p> " They 're amazing , " Duval sums up . He does n't say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's heard too often . <p> Snow algae are n't ice algae . Many of the ice species tolerate salt water and survive in solid ice packs at the poles . " They 're completely different species , " Duval says , sounding a little surprised that anyone would want to lump the groups together . <p> To find snow algae , look for serious snow , long lasting and several feet deep . William H. Thomas of Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla , Calif. , goes to the high spots in Yosemite National Park and other snowfields at least 10,000 feet up in the Sierra Nevadas , the Cascades , and the Rocky Mountains . There , Thomas ' particular passion , watermelon snow , tinted mostly by Chlamydomonas nivalis , ripens around July in the same places year after year . " The red snow gets all the publicity , " remarks Ronald W. Hoham of Colgate University in Hamilton , N.Y . " I find the green and orange more interesting . " <p> The nonred species thrive where snow lingers longest in upstate New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountain , New Hampshire 's White Mountains , Vermont 's Green Mountains , and Maine 's Mount Katahdin all harbor colonies of snow algae , Hoham and Duval report in a paper to be published in Rhodora . <p> These species never develop the extensive red pigments that protect watermelon snow algae from brilliant sunlight . The green snow algae , mostly in the genus Chloromonas , typically stick to high-elevation , shady forests of fir and spruce . These algae generally bloom several inches below the snow surface . <p> Orange species tolerate a bit more light , and Duval and Hoham spotted their salmon-colored alga in the open snow of several New England ski resorts . They have n't found the species in wilderness areas yet , and they speculate that it spreads in part by hitchhiking on skis . <p> As Duval and Hoham pored over their map of Northeastern algae sightings , they decided that Chloromonas algae were more likely to bloom where 80 inches of snow falls in a winter than in spots with less-extreme weather . This insight sent Duval algae prospecting in West Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Englanders have never noticed the colorful local snow algae high in their woodlands , Hoham is understanding , if a bit narrowly focused . " Nobody wants to go hiking when it 's miserable outside , " he says . " They miss everything . " <p> Snow algae are hardly an exclusively North American phenomenon- or a new one . Greek philosopher Aristotle reported red snow more than 2,000 years ago . <p> An 1818 British expedition exploring off the northwest coast of Greenland spotted crimson streaks on snowy cliffs and brought home red meltwater for analysis . " Our credulity is put to an extreme test upon this occasion , but we can not learn that there is any reason to doubt the fact as stated , " remarked the London Times . <p> Experts of that time decided that an iron deposit from a meteorite must have stained the explorers ' snow . Only a year later , however , biologist F. Bauer described living cells in colored snow . The snow dwellers turned out to be bona fide single-celled , chloroplast-carrying members of the green algae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The greatest sense of the worldwide scope of snow algae came from a Hungarian botanist , ErzsEbet Kol , who started publishing scientific articles on the subject in the mid 1920s . For the next 50 years , she described snow algae sent to her from Antarctica , New Guinea , and other far-flung snow fields and accumulated during her own wide-ranging travels . She collected specimens from Transylvania to Alaska and even managed to get into isolationist Albania to describe its algae in 1958 . <p> With all these records , Duval wondered a few years ago why Africa remained the only continent where no one had reported snow algae . In 1998 , he and Edilma Duval set off on an algae-prospecting jaunt on Mount Neltner in Morocco . <p> They brought an ice chest of Moroccan snow back to a laboratory in Spain . The next year , they and Hoham , their taxonomic collaborator , published the first report of snow algae in Africa . <p> Scientifically surveying for algae looks a bit like poking around in the snow . " People will come up to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Brian Duval says . <p> The colors blossoming on snowbank surfaces in springtime are just the tip of the life cycle for snow algae . The red of watermelon snow comes from pigments in algal cysts , resting cells protected by sturdy coats . Hoham has received healthy cyst samples shipped at - 70C , a temperature that destroyed active algal cells . Using radioactive carbon , Thomas and Duval have shown that cysts photosynthesize , but otherwise they just wait for the next season 's action . <p> As snow vanishes in summer , the cysts settle onto the ground . " The red ones look like a crust of dried blood , " Duval says . <p> Summer passes . Snow falls again . The cysts essentially just lie there as snow piles up on top of them week after week . <p> When the snow starts melting in the high-altitude spring , the cysts burst , releasing single cells , each with two whiplike tails . They swim upward , bucking the current of draining meltwater . <p> " It 's a race against time , " explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ algal cells have to gain the upper reaches of their water world to reproduce . The cells , only 10 to 15 micrometers across , fight their way through several feet of snow in meltwater that has n't reached even 1C . Because their snowy world is disappearing , the swimmers ca n't afford to dally . <p> Although the pH of most springtime snow hovers around 5 , during the first flush of melting , it can sink to 3.5 , about the same acidity as peat bogs , Hoham reports . The bogs ' well-known ability to preserve corpses stems from the death of most microbes in such an environment , yet snow algae swim through similar punishment . <p> When some of the swimmers near the surface , they mate and form the protective cysts . Others do n't mate when they reach the top , but they still form cysts . Hoham is trying to sort out why some algae he studies seem not to have sex at all , but others even in the same population reproduce sexually . <p> This month at the Eastern Snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are scheduled to present results from their ongoing study of factors influencing algal mating . The researchers have established , for instance , that in the lab , New York Chloromonas mates most readily in a mild , blue glow , which resembles sunlight filtering through an evergreen forest and a layer of snow . These algae responded better to 20 hours of light followed by 4 hours of darkness than to New York 's 14-hour days . Hoham wonders if he 'll find the same strain at higher latitudes , such as Quebec , where spring days last much of the night . <p> He and his students will also describe a reproductive pattern that Hoham had never seen before in this group of green algae . When mobile cells of what seems to be a new species of Chloromonas start to mate , most have oblong shapes . Some 8 hours later , the oblong cells have blimped out , so the combining cells are spherical . <p> After mating , the snow algae drift back to the ground with the dwindling snow . In this spartan world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into growing their protective coats and assuming a holding mode before their habitat melts away . In this way , they stay safe until the next spring rush . <p> Where an uninitiated person might see just a big pile of slush , snow biologists recognize a teeming , speck-eat-dot world . As primary producers , the algae capture energy from the sun . Bacterial colonies develop around the algae . Rotifers and other higher-level predators then move in . <p> More complex beasts , such as Mesenchytraeus ice worms , also come to graze . " You 'll know them if you see them , " chuckles Hoham . The dark squiggles , an inch-plus long , even have segments like earthworms . <p> Collembola , or snow fleas , hop about this nearly invisible zoo . Tardigrades , or water bears , also are on the prowl but more at a lumber than a hop . These flyspeck-size hunters have a blob of a body with a tiny head mounted low in front . Proportionally big claws adorn their eight stubby legs , which have no joints . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of them going one way and part another , " Hoham says . <p> With all these beings , fungi find plenty of material to decompose . They weave their strands through the snowfields . <p> A white expanse of snow is far from barren , Hoham says . " Basically , you 've got everything in it you would find in a freshwater ecosystem , " he explains . <p> But unlike idyllic rivers and streams , the snow ecosystem does n't offer people a fresh-caught meal . Duval says that after he explains that he has n't lost something in the snow , hikers often say , " I hear that watermelon snow can kill you . " <p> Duval 's never even tasted it . While he does n't expect the algae to prove toxic , he fears the abundant bacteria . " I would advise people not to eat watermelon snow , " he says . " You do n't want to get diarrhea in an alpine environment . " <p> He does acknowledge the skimpiness of experimental evidence on this last topic . His extensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reno , Nev. , who fed six people concentrated snow algae . Only one person developed diarrhea , the doctors reported in 1997 in Wilderness and Environmental Medicine . <p> While Thomas does n't recommend taking chances with bacteria either , he has tried a quick taste of colored snow . " It 's nondescript , a little tangy , like watermelon , " he says . <p> What has n't killed snow algae has made them stronger , or at least , more interesting to biochemists and physiologists . <p> A series of papers in the late 1970s and 1980s by British scientists reported chemical tricks for withstanding extreme cold . They described what Hoham calls " most peculiar " fatty acids in the creatures ' cell membranes . The compounds ' carbon chains have an unusually high ratio of double bonds to single bonds . These ratios make the fatty acids more fluid at low temperatures , just as margarines with polyunsaturated oils stay squishier in the fridge than lard with its heavy load of saturated fat . Membrane flexibility should help algal cells continue to function at low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on snowfields , the algae display other chemical oddities . A red snow alga , for example , develops 12 carotenoid pigments . Harvey Marchant of the Australian Antarctic Division in Tasmania published electron micrographs of algae from the Snowy Mountains of Australia in 1982 . The pictures and chemical analysis revealed carotenoids spread around the outer zone of the cell as if shielding the chlorophyll from sun overload . <p> The carotenoids protect against ultraviolet light , Thomas and Duval argued in 1995 . Red algae in natural sunlight have 75 percent as much photosynthetic capacity as do those protected from the portion of the sun 's ultraviolet spectrum known as UV-B . Green snow algae , which lack these protective carotenoids , suffer much more from full sunlight . Those without artificial UV protection show only 15 percent of the photosynthetic power of protected cells . In nature , the green species shield themselves with a layer of snow . <p> Duval , Thomas , and Kalidas Shetty of the University of Massachusetts in Amherst have just published the first evidence for another potential algal strategy for protection against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiation called UV-A , the classic watermelon snow alga of California pumped up the amount of its phenolic components by 5 to 12 percent . " These are the compounds that are in red wine , " Duval explains . They 've attracted interest as antioxidants , cellular police that capture potentially damaging singlet oxygen and free radicals . Likewise , UV-C juiced up the phenolic content , the research team reported in the Journal of Applied Phycology late last year . <p> Geneticist James Leebens-Mack , also at Colgate , has been examining snow algae . This month , he and Tomas Bonome are presenting their comparisons of genetic material from several species . The pattern of similarities , some strong and some weak , that they have described suggests that the snowy lifestyle evolved in algae at least twice , says Hoham . <p> He and three coeditors are putting finishing touches on a book with an unusually multidisciplinary approach to the topic . Cambridge University Press plans to publish Snow Ecology in August . With a sort of remembering-Woodstock glow , Hoham describes his first discipline-mixing experience at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their scheduled times by at least 3 hours each night as snow chemists encountered microbiologists who 'd never known what paleoecologists thought of snow physics . <p> " We did n't want to stop because we 'd never heard each others ' stories , " Hoham reminisces . <p> Duval laments , " The whole topic of snow ecology has been overlooked . " Modern genetics could change that , he notes . He expects its tools to energize the field , untangling the chemistry and giving rise to new ways to use the discoveries . <p> Maybe then , at last , he 'll get through whole meetings where no one smirks about yellow snow . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : No , it 's not a murder scene .
