George W. Bush is flying at 30,000 ft. and talking a mile a minute . Fresh from delivering a speech about health care for the uninsured , the Republican presidential candidate is moving briskly from topic to topic , from the wretchedness of entrenched poverty to the nation 's lost faith in the individual to the ' 60s paternalism that he thinks caused it all  --  the attitude , he says , that " we ca n't trust poor parents to make a decision for their children . " His hands reach out as he speaks . His eyes are animated , especially when the subject is education or the need to treat immigrants with respect . " This sounds like rote , " he told TIME after unspooling a riff on how to improve schooling for the underclass . " It 's not ! It 's what I believe ! It 's not somebody writing a speech for me . It 's my passion ! " <P> If it sounds as if George Bush is protesting too much , that 's because he 's got a credibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a party that has made headlines by shutting down the government and refusing to add a few quarters to the minimum wage . The Texas Governor also has his own recent past to overcome , including a bruising primary fight that featured him cozying up to the religious right and running a singularly uncompassionate campaign against his opponent , John McCain . Which explains why Bush has spent the month since McCain withdrew trying to resuscitate his " compassionate conservative " message by issuing a series of conspicuously centrist  --  some might even say liberal  --  policy proposals . And also why his aides insist , on what seems to be an hourly basis , that whatever Bush is announcing that day proves yet again that " he 's a different kind of Republican . " <P> The symbolism Bush employs can be just as orchestrated . The Governor rarely turns up in front of a camera these days without surrounding himself with African-American schoolchildren , Hispanic social workers , Catholic clergymen  --  or , as was the case last Thursday in Austin , Texas , gay Republicans . So it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that after dropping by an adult learning center in a gritty west Cleveland , Ohio , neighborhood and testing out his fearless , if primitive Spanish , Bush went around the corner to the West Side Ecumenical Ministry to announce a plan to help the working poor buy health insurance , make a down payment on a new home and build up personal savings . The price tag : a very un-Republican $42 billion over five years . " Our economy must also honor and reward the hard work of factory and field , of waiting tables and driving cabs , " Bush told the largely Hispanic audience . " Not just enterprise , but sheer effort ; not just technology , but toil . "
