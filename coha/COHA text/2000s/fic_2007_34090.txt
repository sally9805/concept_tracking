The MacLeans are an ancient family , long of grace and fair of face . ' T is a pity they know their own worth , fer it makes ' em difficult to bargain with . Shrewd they are ; ' t is rare they come out on the bottom side of any bargain . Yer own pa says he 'd rather be bit by a sheep than dicker with a MacLean . Old Woman Nora of Loch Lomond to her three wee granddaughters one cold night Gretna Green , Scotland April 9 , 1807 Fiona MacLean forced herself to smile . " Father MacCanney , we 've come to be married . " The heavyset priest looked uncertainly from Fiona to the groom and then back . " B-but  --  he 's not  --  I canna  --  " " Yes you can , Father , " Fiona said in her calmest voice , her hands fiercely fisted in the strings of her reticule . Come hell or high water , she was about to end the longest , most drawn-out , and most foolish feud in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned future , and perhaps even a bit of her heart . The thought made her stomach sink lower . But this marriage was necessary if she wished to keep her brothers safe from their own foolish tempers . It 's the only way . I can not waver . " Fiona , lass , " Father MacCanney said in an exasperated voice , " he 's not fit to be a groom ! " " All the more reason for me tomarry the fool . " At the priest 's blink of surprise , she quickly added , " ' T is a known fact that a good woman can turn even the most contrary , rotten , stubborn ne'er-do-well into a responsible man . " The priest glanced uneasily at her prospective groom . " Aye , but  --  " " Have no fear for me , Father . I know he 's no prize , but he 's the one I want . " " Fiona , I know the lad might benefit from the match . ' T is just  --  " " I know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philanderer who 's been with every woman from the North Sea to the fleshpots of London . " The priest flushed at the mention of fleshpots . " Yes , yes . So everyone knows , but  --  " " He is also a complete wastrel who has made no effort to embrace a useful life . I know he 's not the best choice of groom , but  --  " " He 's not even conscious ! " the priest burst out . " He canna even say his own name ! " Fiona glanced down to where her man , Hamish , had dropped her groom on the cold flagstone at her feet . Muddy rivulets dripped onto the church floor from Kincaid 's clothing . " I was afraid that was your problem . " Even unconscious , Jack was a royal pain . Some things never changed . " Lassie , ye canna drag an unconscious man to the altar . " " Why not ? " " Because  --  because ' t is just not done , that 's why ! " The priest eyed Hamish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her as he 'd done since she was a child . A large sword hung at his side , three primed pistols were stuck into his wide leather belt , his bushy red beard bristled , and his fierce gaze pinned them all in place . " How did the lad come to be unconscious and muddy ? " Father MacCanney asked pointedly . Fiona hated to lie . She really did . But the less the priest knew , the safer he 'd be from retribution from her brothers . Torn in pain at the loss of their youngest brother , they raged through Castle MacLean , fists lifted to the sky , fury pouring from them . The curse of the MacLeans had flowed then . Rain and thunder had flooded from the skies for days , threatening those who lived in the village below Castle MacLean . The river had already been swollen from early spring rains , and the danger of flooding was imminent . Fiona could not let that happen . And she knew how to stop the feud . First , she 'd had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his dalliance with some woman in nearby Stirling ; it was simple to find the wastrel then . She could only hope that the rest of her plan would follow so easily . Somehow , she greatly doubted she 'd be so blessed . She shrugged and said with as much cheerful indifference as she could muster , " We found him . " " Unconscious ? " " Yes . " " Where ? " " In the road . His horse must have bolted . " The priest did not look convinced . " How did the lad get so wet ? " He eyed her with deep suspicion . " There 's not been any rain in this part of Scotland in over three weeks . " Fiona had to distract him . " Hamish , can you awaken the lout ? Father MacCanney will not marry us unless he 's conscious . " Hamish grunted , then bent over , grabbed the unconscious Jack Kincaid by the hair , and lifted his head . Fiona 's gaze fell on his face , and her heart leapt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastered flat from the rain , Jack Kincaid was painfully handsome . Fine , firmly cut features with a strong jaw and masculine nose , deep auburn hair , and , had they been open , the blue , blue eyes of an angel . But angel he was not . In the distance , a faint rumble of thunder caused the priest to look toward the open windows . Outside , bright sunshine warmed the stone walls , nary a cloud in the blue sky . Fiona 's gaze remained on Kincaid . It took all of her moral strength not to kick him  --  just a little  --  while he was so conveniently at her feet . Since that dark day fifteen years ago when she 'd discovered Jack Kincaid 's true nature , she 'd kept her emotions and thoughts about him locked away . She 'd thought they 'd died , but apparently some anger and resentment remained . Still grasping Jack 's hair , Hamish shook his head , then looked at Fiona . " The jackass is not awakening . " " I can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hamish dropped his burden , ignoring the thud that made the priest wince . Relief filled Father MacCanney 's face . " Ye ca n't marry him , then . " " Yes , I can , " Fiona said firmly . " He will awaken soon . " The priest sighed . " Ye are the most stubborn lass I ever met . " " Only when I must be . You can not deny that ' twill be good for the lout to be in the care of a strong woman . " " No , " Father MacCanney said in a constricted voice . " I canna deny that . " " I 'll put up with neither drinking nor carousing . He will also be made to attend church regularly . Whether he knows it or not , Jack 's wild days are over . " Something like pity flickered over the priest 's face . " You canna make a person change , lassie . They have to want to change . " " Then I shall make him want to change . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do you wish to embark on this madness , lassie ? " " ' T is the only way to stop the feud . Callum 's death must be the last , " she said in a hard voice . The priest 's eyes had filled with tears . " I mourn your brother , too , lass . " " You can not mourn Callum more than I. And as if his death is not enough to bear , my older brothers are calling out for vengeance . If someone does not stop this nonsense now  --  " Her voice broke . Callum , beautiful Callum . Her youngest brother , with his quicksilver grin and equally fast flashes of temper , was now lying six feet under , a stone marker the only reminder of his life . And all because of an idiotic feud that began hundreds of years ago . The MacLeans and the Kincaids had been fighting for so long that no one remembered the true cause of their hatred . Now , because of Callum 's stupid refusal to let a silly insult from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Callum had pushed the argument , pushed the fight . And paid the price with his life . One blow , the edge of the stone hearth ... and that was it . Callum was dead , and the banked fires of the age-old feud had erupted into flames . The priest pressed her hand . " I 've heard that the Kincaids feel Callum 's death was not their fault . That perhaps someone else  --  " " Please , Father . Do not . " The priest looked at her face . She knew what he was seeing : the circles under her eyes , the paleness of her skin , the tremor of her lips as she fought desperately to keep her tears at bay . " Father , " she said softly , " my brothers blame Eric Kincaid for Callum 's death . Nothing I say can cool their thirst for vengeance . But if I marry Jack , he and his kin will be a part of our family . My brothers will be forced to let go of their plans . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not lose another brother . " Anger surged through her , raw and furious . Outside , the ominous rumble of thunder darkened the otherwise clear day . Hamish nodded , as if agreeing with an unspoken thought . Father MacCanney , meanwhile , paled . The priest was silent a long moment , and Fiona could see he was on the verge of agreeing . He just needed a little push . " Besides , Father , if I make this sacrifice and marry to end the feud , it might break the curse . " Father MacCanney swallowed noisily and pulled his hand from her grasp . " Hsst , lass ! I 'll have none of that curse talk in this holy place . " That was because he believed it . According to the old tales , a white witch , disgusted with Fiona 's great-grandfather 's temper and self-serving ways , had declared that from then on , every member of the MacLean family would be given tenuous control over something as tempestuous as they were  --  the weather . Whenever a MacLean lost his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afire and made the ground tremble . Hail tore away the leaves of every tree and greenery within sight . Floods roared through the valley , ruining harvests , washing away homes and , sometimes , people . When the people of the village saw clouds gathering at Castle MacLean on the hill , they huddled in their houses in fear . Fiona closed her eyes . They were her people . Hers . Just as Callum had been her brother . She could not fail in this . If she did not defuse the situation , her brothers ' fury would unthinkingly destroy everything . The only way to break the curse was for every member of a generation to perform a " deed of great good . " So far , no generation had succeeded . Perhaps this would count as Fiona 's deed . Fiona looked at the priest from beneath her lashes . " The curse has been proven time and again , Father . " The priest shook his head . " I feel fer yer family , lass . But this mad idea  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My last hope . " Father , I have no choice . Kincaid has to marry me . " Father MacCanney 's eyes widened . " Blessed saints above , ye ca n't mean  --  ye have n't  --  ye did n't  --  " " Aye . I am with child . " The priest whipped out a handkerchief and mopped his brow . " Dear me ! Dear me ! That changes everything , it does . I 'll not have a bastard born in my parish . " Fiona threw her arms about the priest 's neck . " Oh , thank you , Father ! I knew I could count on you . " He returned the hug , sighing . " Ye 'd just find another if I didna assist ye , anyway . " " I would n't wish anyone else to marry me , Father . " Of course , she 'd never thought to marry this way at all . She 'd thought that someday , she 'd meet a bonny man who would fall deeply in love with her , and they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by flowers and her family . None of that would happen now . Sadness for what she 'd never have pressed on her heart , but she resolutely pushed the feeling aside . " Father MacCanney , this is the right thing . It will be a new beginning for us all . " The priest sighed again , then turned to Hamish . " At least bring the lad to his feet . No man should marry from the dirt on the floor . " " Thank you , Father , " Fiona said again . " You wo n't be sorry . " " ' T is not me who might be sorry for this day 's work , lassie . " Fiona hoped he was wrong . Hamish prodded the fallen man with his huge boot . " Perhaps I should dunk his head in some water . " He turned to gaze at the cistern . Father MacCanney gasped . " That is holy water ! " " I dinna think God would mind . Besides , ' t is his wedding day and  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips . " Perhaps a wee dram would stir the man . " Hamish stiffened . " Hamish , " Fiona reproved . " We must all sacrifice . " " Ye ask a lot , " Hamish growled . He reached into his coat and pulled out a flask . Reluctantly , he opened it , tilted back Kincaid 's head , and poured a bit into the man 's mouth . Kincaid sputtered , but he did n't push the flask away . Still half-conscious , he reached up and grabbed at it , then poured it into his mouth . " Damn ye ! " Hamish yanked away the flask . " Ye drank half me whiskey ! " The Scotsman grabbed Kincaid 's jacket collar and hauled him up , looking ready to punch him . " Thank you , Hamish , " Fiona said swiftly , moving to stand beside Kincaid . Kincaid blinked , then looked around woozily . " This is ... church ? I 've never before dreamed I was in a church . " Fiona slipped an arm through his , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his masculine scent of sandalwood and musk enveloping her . She immediately had a memory of another time , long ago , of hot hands and hot desires , the desperate ache of wanting  - -  Outside , thunder rumbled again over the sun-drenched garden . Father MacCanney seemed to have trouble swallowing . Hamish sent Fiona a hard look . She blushed , then cleared her throat . " Kincaid , you are indeed in a church . You are here to marry me . " " Marry ? " He looked down at her , and she was struck by the vividness of his gaze , the brilliant blue of Loch Lomond . She felt herself drawn into that gaze , pulled in , sinking as if into a pool of heated water . A faint smile curved his lips . " Fiona MacLean . " The words tickled her ear , smoky and seductive . To her utter dismay , a low heat simmered at his nearness , building with a rapidity that made her gasp . The thunder rumbled louder , and a stir of heated wind sent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands into fists , forcing her heart to resume a steady beat . She could not let herself lose control . She 'd known the dangers of this errand . Jack Kincaid had this effect on every woman . Every woman . None is special , she reminded herself . Her passions cooled at the thought . " Kincaid , stand alert , " she said in a brisk tone . " We 've important things to do this day . " His gaze flickered over her face , lingering on her eyes , her lips . He lowered his face until his whiskey-scented breath warmed her ear and cheek . " Tell me , love , if I marry you in this dream , will I win my way back into your bed ? " Her breath caught , and she whispered back , " Yes , you will be welcome into my bed . This is a real marriage , though we do not care for each other . " " Speak for yourself . " She raised her eyes to his , her heart strangely still . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean I do care for you . I lust at the thought of touching you , of  --  " " That is not caring . " Why had she thought he 'd meant anything else ? If her time with Jack had taught her anything , it was that he was not capable of caring . Not really . " We can discuss all of this later . Right now , we must marry . " His gaze drifted over her face again , resting on her lips . A slow , seductive smile curved his mouth . " I will marry you , Fiona MacLean , and bed you well , as is meant to be . That is indeed the stuff of dreams . " She whispered furiously , " Jack , this is serious . If we marry , we can end the feud . " " Feud ? " She blinked . " The one between our families . " " Oh . That feud . I 'd worry about that myself , if I were n't already dead and dreaming . " He slung his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your worst , Father , " he said grandly . " It 's just a dream . " Father MacCanney met Fiona 's gaze . " Are ye sure , lass ? " he asked again . Outside , the wind was dying a bit , though the heavy taste of rain and the unmistakable scent of lilac filled the air . Fiona took a deep breath . In a few moments , she would be married . Married to a man who would shortly be sober and furious at the events she 'd forced upon him . Married to the man who had long ago betrayed her . A man who would betray her again , if she were foolish enough to give him a chance . She straightened her shoulders . There would be no more chances . " Yes , Father , " she said in a steady voice . " I am ready . "
