There was once a Boy who worked for a Magician . Every day he polished the Magician 's magic wands and the gold stars and moons on his great blue robe . He weeded the garden where the magic herbs grew , and crushed their seeds into powder for the Magician 's spells . He worked very hard indeed . But he was n't happy . More than anything in the world , the Boy wanted to learn magic  --  but the Magician would not teach him . The Boy fed the six white rabbits that lived in a hutch in the garden , but he was always startled when he saw the Magician pull one of them out of somebody 's hat . He washed the dishes in the kitchen , and watched enviously when the Magician picked up an empty jug and poured milk out of it . How did he do these things ? " Master , " he begged , " teach me ! Teach me magic ! " But the Magician always said , " Not yet , Boy . Not till the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magician went out to perform , the Boy went with him , to help him on stage , and to catch any rabbits he might pull out of hats . The Boy loved those days , because then he had one really special job too . When the Magician performed , he always took with him a little puppet theatre in which he showed the play " Saint George and the Dragon "  --  and the Boy was allowed to operatethe puppets . The Boy stood on a box behind the tiny stage , hidden by a curtain , and he pulled the puppets ' strings while the Magician told the story of the play . It was an odd little play . One of the people in it was Father Christmas , but all he had to do was introduce the other characters to the audience . These were the wicked Dragon , who loved fighting ; the Turkish Knight , who fought the Dragon but could never beat him ; and the Doctor , who was there in case anyone was wounded . And of course there was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the way he made Saint George kill the Dragon , at the end . The wounded Dragon staggered round in a circle , puffed out three clouds of white smoke , jumped up in the air and fell down dead . ( The white smoke was really chalk dust , puffed by the Boy from a little pipe . ) The watching children always cheered at this , so the Boy was pleased . It was n't magic , but it was the next best thing . One Christmas , the Magician and the Boy went to perform at a family party given by a Mr. and Mrs. Pennywinkle , in a grand stone house as big as a castle . " Mr. Pennywinkle is a very important person ! " said the Magician , frowning at the Boy . " Everything must be perfect ! " The Magician was a very tall man , with a beaky nose , black eyebrows like doormats , and a bristly mustache . He was alarming when he frowned . The Boy said , " Yes , Master ! Of course ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shampooed the rabbits , and he repainted the trees on the back wall of the puppet theatre stage . And off they went to the party . Continues ...
