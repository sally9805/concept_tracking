// OUR LIVES ARE PLANETARY NOW , SMALL WORLDS AND GREAT ONES , whirling together and whirling apart , great bodies putting at the smaller ones until their orbits nearly converge and the smaller worlds pay a dear price . That 's what we have now-Kepler 's republic , where Madison 's rules bend to Newton 's laws-and that 's where our stories are formed and shaped to be told to us . It 's on one of those smaller worlds that Marcus Stephens died , on December 4 , 1997 . He was thirteen years old and he loved Jesus and the drums and his grandparents . He lived all his life in New Albany , Mississippi , a calcined old railroad town tucked into the Buncombe Hills . William Faulkner-who wrote that in the South , the past is n't even past-was born in New Albany . At the local library , bright and cheerful of an autumn 's morning , the nice young volunteer lady says that she does n't know where Brookwood Avenue is , and the past is suddenly there , pale but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall . " I think that 's down in the colored part of town , " the nice young volunteer lady explains . " We do n't go down there much . " Marcus Stephens lived most of his short life on Brookwood Avenue . He was born with a misconstructed heart ; the wrong arteries and veins ran into and out of the wrong auricles and ventricles . " Transposition of the major vessels " is what they call it . His heart gradually wore itself out . Marcus weakened as his heart did . He lived his entire life on medication and borrowed time . His family struggled . They scraped together gas money so that Marcus could make it to as many of his doctor 's appointments as they could afford for him to make . They worked as hard as they could . They lived within their means . One day , when Marcus was eight years old , a social worker told his grandparents about a federal program that might make their lives easier . At the very least , it would pay for the gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check from the United States government every month in the amount of $446 . The check helped his grandparents defray the expenses involved in caring for the seriously ill child . These expenses included gasoline , food , and the price of a cheap hotel room near the hospital where Marcus lay dying . It was through these checks-which came as part of the Supplemental Security Income programthat the little world of Marcus Stephens felt the inexorable pull of a larger world , a world of important people and big ideas . This world exerted itself on the world of Marcus Stephensbungling through its path , warping its slim and irregular orbitand never felt the slightest tug in return . One day , important people had some big ideas . One day , the checks stopped . Later , after the checks had stopped , Marcus was up in the hospital in Memphis again . He could hardly breathe . His heart was breaking down . He was waiting for a transplant . He wanted his grandfather . Two hours away in New Albany , his grandfather pawned his gun for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its orbit and was gone . So was Marcus Stephens , buried out in Cottonplant . Elder Henry Finley put Marcus in the new cemetery out by the United House of Prayer , the place where Marcus used to love to bang on the drums and sing " Long As I Got King Jesus " with the enthusiastically sanctified ladies of the congregation . Marcus was the fifth person buried in the graveyard . Sometimes , at dusk , Elder Finley looks out over the tiny cemetery and off toward the dimming hills . It 's a small place , Cottonplant is , unincorporated , not even a real place on a map , smaller even than New Albany . The biggest thing around is the feed mill . You ca n't even see the lights of a city from there . THIS IS HOW THE LARGER WORLD WORKS , ACCORDING TO THE LATE economist Robert Lekachman : " Segregate any group as the objects of public charity . Tempt conservative politicians and media allies to stigmatize them as cheats . Make sure that a constant flow of anecdotes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars support lazy or immoral leeches upon the body politic . " It 's a lush place , this larger world , and , God , what creatures live there ! A place of shadow puppets and urban legends , of welfare queens and the cunning poor , getting over on the rest of us . Twenty years ago , an old man emerged from the deep forest , and what tales he told . A woman buying vodka with food stamps . Another woman who missed her federally financed medical checkup because she 'd flown to Hawaii on vacation . Were they real , ducking like shadows through the overripe greenery of perception ? Did it matter whether they were real , as long as we came to believe them ? " He is the first modern president , " a scholar once said of Ronald Reagan , " whose contempt for the facts is treated as a charming idiosyncrasy . " Perhaps . However , as the Scripture warns , the poor-or , more accurately , the impoverished-will be with us always , but who they are and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden and then an obligation , and then a burden and an obligation again . A Square Deal follows a Gilded Age , a Depression follows the Roaring Twenties , and a New Deal follows that . Clintonism follows Reaganism . And the story of Marcus Stephens , a real person who died , follows the story of the welfare queen , whom nobody ever was quite able to find . It 's too easy to blame the old man , who , after all , was little more than a skilled tracker along old trails . He pointed the way , though , and all of our leaders followed . Perception grew thicker , strangling reality . And , in that lingering spirit , the lush and larger world came spinning across the path of the little world of Marcus Stephens . In its momentum , it grew more heedless , more relentless , more truthless . IN 1990 , MARCUS WAS SIX , AND HE 'D BEEN LIVING WITH HIS GRANDPARENTS in their brick house on Brookwood Avenue almost his entire life . Myrtle and Sammie Riddle took Marcus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and because his father was nowhere around . Sammie drove a truck , long hauls all over the South and short hops around Mississippi and Arkansas . He picked up extra cash playing guitar at some small clubs on the unincorporated outskirts of New Albany . Myrtle worked sewing uniforms at the Landau Company just outside town . They 'd met thirty years earlier , when Sammie 'd given Myrtle and her mother a ride home from the grocery store . " There she was , " Sammie recalls . " A good-looking sixteen-year-old woman outside the market store . We been together ever since . " Ten days after he was born , Marcus had come under the care of Dr. Nancy Chase , a peppery Memphis pediatric cardiologist with a penchant for plain talk and bagpipe music . Chase had little patience with people who tried to play cutely with various government benefits . Once , a woman came to her with two forms . One was an application for disability benefits on behalf of her son . The other was a permission slip that would allow the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full bellows right there in the waiting room . Chase diagnosed the problems with Marcus Stephens 's heart . She also noticed that the newborn baby had already had his first stroke . In December 1984 , Marcus had his first cardiac surgery . " He was disabled , " says Chase . " Of that , there is no doubt . " It was too much for Sulatha Stephens , and she left Marcus with her parents . He took immediately to Sammie , and he grew Lip merry if , paradoxically , both weak and hyperactive . " Marcus was the kind of boy who , if he walked in here right now , you 'd be hooked in five minutes , " says Sammie Riddle . The two of them drove all over New Albany in Sammie 's pickup truck , Marcus propped up behind the wheel on his grandfather 's lap . Still , Sammie and Myrtle often found themselves unable to cope with the many ramifications of their grandson 's condition . They did n't know the names of some of the medicines that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual medical bills were paid by Medicaid-Nancy Chase found herself in constant battle with the Mississippi Medicaid office , which was notoriously slow to reimburse physicians-bUt the other expenses drained them . They once went two years between appointments because they did n't have the money to get to Memphis to see Dr. Chase , who became frustrated , not least because Marcus had charmed her , too . " This was a person with a wonderful joie de vivre , " Chase says . " He was a tough little kid that way-very affable , but seriously ill . He could drink a glass of water and go into heart failure . " By 1990 , Sammie and Myrtle Riddle were scraping by . They woke tip at night to give Marcus his medicines , and they got to as many of his doctor 's appointments as they could afford to . That same year , far from Brookwood Avenue , out beyond the Buncombe Hills , nine very important people walked out from behind a purple curtain in Washington , D. C. , and the world of Marcus Stephens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DUST DANCE IN THE NOONDAY SUNLIGHT , AND THE LOBBY IS alive with a half dozen different languages . Women chase their children around the tattered leather armchairs that seem to be collapsing into themselves the way old men disappear into their clothes . The Community Legal Services , Inc. , in Philadelphia is a stubborn relic , its purposes as battered and worn as the stairs that lead up to its offices . " The invisible America , " says Jonathan Stein , the general counsel of the CLS , gesturing toward the crowded lobby . In 1990 , Stein and the CLS won a victory in the Supreme Court on behalf of a disabled boy named Brian Zebley . It involved the Supplemental Security Income program of the Social Security Administration . SSI had been developed in the I 970s as part of the effort to federalize the nation 's welfare system . The program involved cash payments , and it was developed to meet the ancillary expenses incurred by families with disabled children . " It was often meant to replace the income of a parent , usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a disabled child , " Stein explains . However , the eligibility criteria for SSI were severely restrictive . Benefits were paid only to families whose children were diagnosed with one of fifty-seven specific physical or mental problems . Brian Zebley had a staggering array of birth defects that included congenital brain damage and musculoskeletal impairment . He 'd been awarded SSI benefits when he was two years old on the grounds of mental retardation , but his benefits had been cut off two years later because he " no longer met or equaled the requirements " of the SSI program . In 1983 , the Zebley family initiated a court action contesting the loss of Brian 's benefits , which indirectly meant that their case challenged the SSI criteria . In 1990 , the Supreme Court decided in Brian Zebley 's favor . Benefits would now he awarded to any child who failed to exhibit " age appropriate " behavior as determined by two doctors , a teacher or supervisor , and an SSI examiner . Moreover , the court ordered a review of all the children who 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time the Supreme Court was considering the case of Brian Zebley , the SSI criteria for mental disorders Were revised to include conditions such as autism and Down 's syndrome , as well as several behavioral problems . A child 's functional ability became as important as the child 's medical condition . In addition , Congress insisted that the Social Security Administration work harder to publicize the SSI program . Many doctors did n't even know that the program existed . As a result of all this , between 1989 and 1994 the number of SSI recipients went from three hundred thousand to nine hundred thousand , and the cost of the program went from $1.2 billion to $4.5 billion . Right in the middle of that SSI boom , on June 30 , 1992 , Myrtle Riddle filled out the fourteen-page form from the Social Security Administration on behalf of her grandson . CHILD SUPPORT STOPPED MANY MONTHS AGO , Myrtle scrawled at the top of page 12 . MOTHER CAN TELL YOU WHEN . There was little question that Marcus qualified under the program 's new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably would 've qualified under the old standards as well . Dr. Chase unhesitatingly endorsed the Riddles ' application . The family began receiving $446 a month to help them care for their grandson . As far as the Riddles were concerned , the money might as well be coming from the moon . THE RIDDLES SPENT MUCH OF THIS MONEY ON NURSES , FILLING IN THE gaps where Medicaid fell short . The nurses ran in shifts at night , because Marcus was hooked up to an IV machine that kept his medicine flowing , and someone had to be near him in case the machine 's batteries ran down . The SSI checks helped ease the burden of caring for Marcus . The extra money enabled them to buy gas to make sure that Marcus got to his appointments , which allowed Dr. Chase to monitor his condition more closely . They could afford the small motels that line tower Union Avenue in Memphis , near the Le Bonheur Children 's Medical Center . The money allowed them to stop occasionally , on the way home from Memphis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Sammie hurt his back and had to retire . Photograph Marcus Stephens-and his-grandfather SammieRiddle 1991. // By the time he was eight , for the first time in his life , and by the relative standards of someone whose heart was wired wrong , Marcus Stephens was thriving . He was a handful at school , but his teachers adored him , not least because he would bring them in his own way out to Elder Finley 's church in the woods . Marcus loved church . It was where he first learned to pound the piano , and it was where he first learned to play the drums , which became his particular passion . He was fascinated by the ladies of the church , especially Big Martha , who , overcome by the spirit , transported and sanctified and carried off temporarily to glory , would enliven every Sunday by giving out a great shout in Jesus ' name . Then , on Monday , Marcus would go to school , and he 'd imitate Big Martha 's raucous testimony for the benefit of his teachers , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the other kids , you 'd be on them in a second , " recalls Patsy Livingston , his special-education teacher . " Him , you 'd have to catch yourself for a second because you 'd be thinking , God , that 's funny . " Still , his stomach hurt him all the time , and he was always tired . He 'd watch other children running through his neighborhood , and he would ask his grandparents what was wrong with him . " Sometimes , " says Myrtle Riddle , " he had the mind of a much younger child . " About a year later , however , the larger world came by again , full of journalists on the dodge and politicians on the make , chasing one another down the old , familiar trails-huge and blundering , mindlessly inertial-and the smaller world of Marcus Stephens was pulled toward it , buffeted by sourceless forces , until after Marcus Stephens was dead . WHAT THE HELL , THOUGHT JONATHAN STEIN IN ONE MAD MOMENT , MAYBE Nixon was innocent , too . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in American print journalism . With a colleague , Woodward was preparing a story for the February 4 , 1994 , edition of The Washington Post that would examine the rise in SSI spending since the Zebley decision . It had been four years since Stein had won the ruling in the Supreme Court . Since then , his office had become a sort of national advocacy center for SSI recipients . As such , Stein had watched as the precipitous rise in SSI recipients ( and the concomitant rise in spending ) began to draw the attention of ambitious politicians . The prevailing political zeitgeist , which held that the public treasury was regularly looted by legions of crafty poor people , mandated that any program that grew as swiftly as SSI had must be " riddled " - as a program is always " riddled " - with " waste , fraud , and abuse . " Always all three together , Stein thought . A mantra . Never waste alone . Never simply fraud and abuse . Stein had watched the backlash build . IF THE BACKLASH BEGAN ANYWHERE , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state legislator named Pat Flanagin noticed that one of the poorer clients to whom he sold insurance seemed to have a great deal of money in the bank . " First , " Flanagin later told Forbes Media Critic , " I thought she was a prostitute or selling drugs . " Later , Flanagin said , he discovered that her money was coming from the SSI program . To Flanagin , anyway , the woman 's children did n't seem disabled in any way . He suspected that the program had somehow gone haywire , but he could n't get any of his colleagues in the state legislature interested . Instead , Flanagin passed along his suspicions to Jerry Dean , a reporter at the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette . Flanagin maintained that a great number of healthy children were receiving SSI benefits and that some mothers were coaching their children to act up in school so that they 'd somehow qualify as disturbed . The reporter added a helpful tag to the story . He called the payments " crazy checks . " As the primary documentary source for its claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done that year at Arkansas State University in which , of Ill educators and guidance counselors in northeast Arkansas , only 9 percent believed the program was being administered correctly . In reality , this " study " was simply a classroom exercise , an extensive homework assignment given by a professor named John Slate , who watched , amazed , as his students ' work took on a life and purpose of its own . Over the next two years , as the SSI program came under assault , Slate 's study would be cited by news organizations from ABC News to The Boston Globe to The Wall Street Journal . " We had no hard data , just perceptions , and those from a small portion of a small state , " says State , who works today at the University of Texas at El Paso . " Once the politicians got a hold of it , they used it in ways for which it was never intended , and not one of them called me . It 's made me more distrustful than ever of politicians . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who wished to put an academic gloss on an ideological crusade . The SSI program fairly flew onto the national radar screen . The stories from the Arkansas paper were picked up on the wires . Flanagin began speaking on radio talk shows in several states . Elsewhere , a Louisiana congressman named James McCrery heard from one constituent that the constituent 's wife , a schoolteacher , " suspected " that people were working the system . McCrery began to agitate on the issue among his congressional colleagues . However , the actual evidence for systemic fraud in the SSI was a conspicuously fragile amalgam of supposition and anecdote , held together by the increasingly strong presumption that any large social entitlement program must be rife with abuse . And in Washington and elsewhere , this presumption was rapidly hardening into such a deeply held faith that even a Democratic president ultimately would feel secure in telling the nation that the era of big government was over . And then , in Pennsylvania , there appeared a woman who claimed to have the goods . " I 'M SORRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I WANT TO BE A PART OF THIS story , " the woman says . " I 'm really not interested in talking about this . " But once , she had been . Once , she could n't get enough people to listen to her . Nora Cooke Porter was a pediatrician and a lawyer . She worked in the Pennsylvania Bureau of Disability Determination in Harrisburg and was appalled by the meteoric growth in the number of SSI recipients that she had to monitor . She told people that kids were getting checks for fighting in class . According to sources familiar with her work , she was loud and persistent in her claims that families were cheating the SSI system , that waste , fraud , and abuse were widespread . She thought most of the kids were gang kids . People were buying Mercedes-Benzes with their SSI checks . She established her own standards for eligibility , which she fought for , often against the other people in the office . She could spot the fakers . She wrangled constantly with her superiors , so much so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . She left shortly thereafter , under an agreement by which neither she nor her former colleagues would talk about her departure . Before she left , however , Porter contacted Bob Woodward , outlining her concerns , which was how Jonathan Stein came to be on the telephone with him . Stein suspected that Woodward was ready to cast Nora Cooke Porter as an embattled whistleblower and suggested that Woodward might want to check with her superiors in Harrisburg to make sure that he was n't hanging his story on the office crank . " He berated me , " Stein recalls . " How come you 're telling me this so late ? My reply was that I 'd just learned that they were going to use her and that I thought he should know . He just brushed me off , told me it was too late . " Woodward declined to comment on this phone conversation . " How long have you been in the business ? " he asked me when contacted for this article . " Can you remember everything about a story you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of investigative zeal and policy wonkery coauthored by Woodward and Benjamin Weiser-ran at the top of the paper 's front page on February 4 , 1994 . Nora Cooke Porter 's photo ran with it . She was its lead-an honest bureaucrat foiled by clever poor people and cowardly supervisors . She is depicted in the first two paragraphs as sitting at her desk in Harrisburg , flipping in " frustration " through " some of the thousands " of SSI applications she 'd had to handle . The story 's second paragraph reads : " The files show , she says , that children who curse teachers , fight with classmates , perform poorly in school , or display chatacteristics of routine rebellion are often diagnosed with behavioral disorders and therefore qualify for the SSI program 's cash benefits . " The story never explains what that curious " she says " is doing in the middle of the sentence . Moreover , despite the vivid characterization of Porter in the lead , she is scarcely quoted , nor is there any indication that many of her colleagues considered her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single specific example of fraud cited from those thousands of files through which she was flipping in frustration . Subsequent to the story in the Post , Porter said in other interviews that the SSI program was riddled with fraud , that her efforts to root it out had been stymied from above , and that " there were things big and fearful driving the program . " Again , she declined to cite examples of any of this . When contacted for this story , Porter would n't comment on these points , and neither would Woodward , although several years ago , he did tell James Ledbetter in The Village Voice that he had examples to back up Porter 's claims but that he had held them back due to " privacy problems . " Ledbetter asked Woodward why he did n't just use the files pseudonymously . ( Woodward , after all , has managed to keep the biggest secret in the history of American journalism for almost thirty years . ) Woodward told Ledbetter that he did n't want to get " bogged down in details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privacy concerns , " Woodward explained when contacted for this story . " I 'd have to go back over my notes , but I can tell you that the story was very carefully reported . " Indeed , after Porter leaves center stage , the rest of the Post 's story is a judicious account of the growth in SSI spending since the Zebley decision . But the story lent to Porter the credibility of an embattled whistle-blower , and the backlash against the SSI program accelerated . On the day it appeared , two Wisconsin Democrats-Senator Herb Kohl and Representative Gerald Kleczka-cited it in a " Dear Colleague " letter that demanded an examination of the SSI program . At a town meeting , Newt Gingrich denounced the phenomenon of " crazy checks . " In May , The Boston Globe wrote a story about the program that cited both Porter and the Arkansas State study , a perfect parlay of dubious sources . On October 13 , with the congressional elections approaching fast , ABC 's PrimeTime Live aired an examination of the SSI program . Whereas Stein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's appalling . The segment was called " Crazy Checks . " It featured correspondent Chris Wallace tramping around Arkansas , grilling indigent families about benefits they barely understood . " Act crazy and you can get a check of more than $400 a month from the government , " said Wallace . The Arkansas State study was cited , its data once again dramatized well beyond any claim its authors had ever made for it . ( Neither Wallace nor PrimeTime Live anchor Diane Sawyer nor any ABC News spokesperson replied to phone messages or to registered letters asking for comment on this story . ) Photograph In his story , Bob Woodward ( left ) gave Nora Cooke Porter the aura of an embattled whistle-blower . Chris Wallace 's report , " Crazy Checks , " was lurid , calling SSI a " governmetn giveaway. " // And up arose Nora Cooke Porter again , to claim-without offering any support-that fewer than 30 percent of the children receiving SSI benefits really deserved them , which meant that more than six hundred thousand children were cheating , a wildly improbable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , he told his audience , " If Porter 's estimates are anywhere near accurate , then SSI ... has become a massive , taxpayer-funded scam . " Jonathan Stein looked deeply into this " if " -a weaselly word beginning a duplicitous sentence that was already on its way to becoming a dishonest paragraph . He saw the future in that single word . He saw it almost as an active player , hazy and indistinct , an accessory before the fact . MARCUS WAS ELEVEN NOW , AND HE WAS HEADING INTO MIDDLE SCHOOL Patsy Livingston and Judy Brown , another teacher , loved him , even though he was absent a lot . He often left halfway through the school day , going home to sleep through most of the afternoon and evening on his grandparents ' couch . They told the other students that Marcus was very sick but that the doctors were doing all they could . A couple of times , they put on little fundraisers to help his family . They called them Dollars-for-Marcus Days , One night , when Marcus was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him while Sammie drove home . By the time Sammie got back to New Albany , Marcus 's condition had grown worse . It looked as though he might not last the night , and he was calling for his grandfather . Sammie had absolutely no money . The SSI money had gone to hotels and food . There was no gas in the car . He began to tear the house apart , looking for any money he might 've forgotten , but also because he felt like tearing something apart , and the house was handy . Just then , Judy Brown called . The teachers had taken tip a collection that day , and they 'd raised $235 , and did Sammie want her to bring it over ? No , ma'am , Sammie said . I 'll pick it tip . And so he did , and he used it to drive to Memphis to be with his grandson , who did not die that night . BY MARCH 1995 , THREE MAJOR STUDIES HAD CONCLUDED THAT THE primary problems with the SSI program consisted of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both of which had their roots in the expansion of the program after the Zebley decision . The most thorough of these studies-a report by the General Accounting Office-concluded that by 1994 , two out of every three applicants for the SSI program were being denied . ( In fact , eight hundred thousand children had been turned away from the program since 1990 . ) There was little evidence of widespread fraud , the report read . Another studythis one for the House Ways and Means Committee and prompted by a hearing at which the principal evidence was a tape of the PrimeTime Live piece and a sheaf of critical newspaper clippings-concluded that most of the anecdotes involving fraudulent claims were of claims that , upon investigation , had been denied anyway . In short , these studies concluded that the theoretical basis for the assault on the SSI program was wrong and that the rhetorical basis for the assault was fictional . But legends persist . Responding to the GAO report , Congressman McCrery , who 'd bought the legend whole and right from the start , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a copy of the report . " The GAO report says you ca n't fix it , " hollered McCrery , which it certainly did not . Over the next year , more studies debunked the notion of general fraud in the program , the notion of parents " coaching " their children , and the myth of the " crazy checks . " The inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services , the Disability Policy Panel of the Congress , and an investigation by the Social Security Administration all advocated fine-tuning the SSI program but discovered little evidence of fraud and abuse and no evidence at all of successful parental " coaching . " Reporters-from leftist Alexander Cockburn in The Nation to Christopher Georges in the conservative Forbes MediaCriticwere sharply critical of the journalism that had helped spur the attack on the SSI program . ( According to Georges , one of ABC 's primary on-camera sources , a physician , offered to sell him information concerning SSI fraud . Georges declined . ) Even The Washington Post came to editorialize that the SSI critics " had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautioned Bill Clinton not to cut the program too severely . But the damage had been done . The uproar over the SSI program still clearly echoed throughout the larger world . As part of the welfare-reform legislation that President Clinton signed on August 22 , 1996 , every child who had been enrolled in the SSI program under the expanded definition of disability since the Zebley decision had to be reevaluated-280,000 of them in less than a year . Also , the Social Security Administration proposed a more restrictive set of eligibility standards for the SSI program . The era of big government was over , and Dick Morris was again whispering sweet triangulations into Clinton 's ear . The president was reelected , and three weeks later , on November 27 , 1996 , 260,000 children and their families were notified that they might lose their SSI benefits . On April 14 , 1997 , a bipartisan group of moderate senators sent Clinton a letter . The letter cited a colloquy on the floor of the Senate two years earlier , during the heart of the firestorm over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kent Conrad of North Dakota , and then-majority leader Robert Dole . In part , the letter read : Photograph Marcus Stephens 1989. // " Congress did not call for or intend for a radical overhaul of the program .... It was the intent of the Congress to remove from the SSI program children who are not truly disabled . Just as importantly , it was the intent of the Congress that children with truly disabling conditions-including those with one marked and one moderate condition-retain SSI coverage .... It is our fear that the level of disability the SSA is proposing to adopt will place children with disabilities at risk . " Clinton rejected the overture in favor of the new standards that had been developed by the SSA . The resultant flood of paperwork swamped the understaffed bureaucracies that had to cope with it . State agencies often simply cut children willy-nilly . In Mississippi alone , 76 percent of the children were cut off , according to the Social Security Administration . On March 8 , 1997 , a letter was dispatched to Sammie and Myrtle Riddle . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WAS RUNNING OUT OF OPTIONS . MARCUS 'S HEART WAS failing rapidly . She 'd met with the Riddles at the beginning of March , and she told them that the only hope left was to find Marcus a new heart . The Riddles were frightened and confused , and Nancy Chase had seen this in other elderly caretakers . There was an almost religious reluctance to put a part of one person into the body of another . To Chase 's relief , the Riddles agreed to let her look for a new heart to give their grandson . Take mine , Sammie Riddle told Dr. Chase . Give mine to him . " They explained that that would be too complicated , " Sammie remembers . Chase put Marcus into the heart-transplant program . On April 15 , 1997 , she informed the Social Security Administration that Marcus Stephens was waiting for a heart transplant . A claims examiner in the Mississippi Social Security office named Brenda Smithers put a notation in Marcus 's file . " Dr. Chase has mentioned that they need to think about a heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A TRANSPLANT BROUGHT THE RIDDLES BACK TO Memphis even more often . " They tested Marcus a lot , " says Sammie Riddle . " Once , he had some problems that set him back , and you could see that , maybe , they were thinking , " Why waste a heart on this one ? " Then he came back , and they put him right back there at the top of the list . " On May 27 , 1997 , the Riddles got another letter from the Social Security Administration . " Earlier , " the letter began , " we told you we were reviewing MARCUS T. STEPHENS 's case to see if he is disabled under the new definition of disability for children . After reviewing all the information carefully , we have decided that he no longer qualifies for Supplemental Security Income ( SSI ) . " At the time the letter was mailed , Marcus was almost totally bedridden. in addition , in its files , the Social Security office had Dr. Chase 's notification that Marcus was waiting for a heart transplant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month before . Clearly , the review was no review at all . " Under the new definition of disability for children , " read the first sentence of the fourth paragraph of the letter , " he is no longer disabled as of 05/22/1997 . " THE RIDDLES WERE TIRED AND CONFUSED , AND THERE WAS A SENTENCE in the letter that frightened them . It concerned their right of appeal : " If you lose the appeal , " it said , " you might have to pay back some or all of this money . " " We took the letter at face value , " Sammie explains . " We thought that if we appealed it and we lost , we 'd be liable for a whole lot of money . If the letter 'd been a little clearer , we 'd have known what to do . " The Riddles did not appeal . The checks stopped . Marcus stopped going to school at all . In August , he had surgery to repair the weakened left ventricle of his heart . It was a temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going out of their own pockets now . One night , stuck in New Albany , Sammie Riddle took his gun downtown and pawned it for gas money . " We 'd spend my wife 's whole paycheck just on him , for his bills , " Sammie says . On another occasion , Sammie called Elder Finley out at the church . Marcus had had another small stroke , and there was no way for Sammie and Myrtle to get to Memphis . " We called him over here to pray for Marcus , " Sammie recalls , " but he brought twenty dollars with him , too . " ON NOVEMBER 4 , 1997 , THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION REVIEWED the case of Marcus Stephens for the last time . This time , officials did n't tell anyone they were doing it . Again , they turned him down . Somehow , in their review of all the relevant documents , they again missed the note Brenda Smithers had put into the file in April , the one that said that Marcus Stephens-who now officially was not disabled-was waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcus began badgering his grandmother . " He wanted me to put up the Christmas tree , " she recalls . " I told him it was too early , but he kept at it . Him and his little sister , though , they went and got it out of storage . The lights and stuff was still on it . They put it out on the porch and lit it up . " Within two weeks , Marcus Stephens went to Memphis for the last time . Sammie and Myrtle took to living in Memphis full-time , in the little motels on lower Union Avenue . At night , Marcus would fall asleep on Sammie 's chest . One day , his gas needle rubbing empty , Sammie drove back to New Albany to fetch his guitar so that he could play the theme song from The Beverly Hillbillies for Marcus , who invited all the nurses in to sing along . At noon on December 4 , 1997 , they came to take Marcus to surgery for a procedure to repair a leak in the line that brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather . " Do n't let them put me to sleep , " he said . " I wo n't be able to wake up . " They wheeled Marcus down the hall and into surgery , and his voice still echoed in Sammie 's head . The continued on page 1641 continued from page 1521 afternoon lengthened . Nobody came out . Finally , at about five , the doctors told them that Marcus had come through the procedure but that he would have to stay in the intensive-care unit for a while . Sammie did n't believe them , especially when the social workers began to filter into the waiting room , two at a time . Softly , like shadows , they surrounded Myrtle and Sammie Riddle , and they told them their grandson was gone . " I let them put him to sleep for the operation , " Sammie says . " It 's the only time I let him down . " " IT 'S LIKE THE REPORTING THAT CARL BERNSTEIN and I did on Watergate , Bob Woodward explained when I asked him about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SSI program and who died . I guess you could say that it led to the independentcounsel law , but I do n't think you can say we 're responsible for it . " It sounds like you 're making a stretch here that I do n't want to be part of . " And he said goodbye , and hung up . " I do n't think I want to comment on anything in this story , " said Nora Cooke Porter after I mentioned the death of Marcus Stephens . And she said goodbye , and hung up . Where were they all when Marcus Stephens died ? None of them killed him , certainly-his heart did that . In fact , if they 'd known him , and if they 'd known the details of his short life , they all certainly would 've agreed that he was exactly the kind of child for whom the SSI program was rightly designed . But they did n't know him and did n't want to . He was an abstraction , less substantive than all those children soaking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found , less real than the welfare queen and her vodka , who may not have existed at all . In the larger world , where airy anecdote is hard currency , it was Marcus Stephens who was the phantom . For the record , on that late afternoon in early winter , on the day that Marcus Stephens died , Bob Woodward was still at The Washington Post and Chris Wallace was still at ABC . Jim McCrery was still in Congress and Bill Clinton was still president of the United States . Professor John Slate had moved on from Arkansas State and he was still waiting for reporters to call him about what his students had really found in their homework assignments concerning the SSI program in northeast Arkansas . Jonathan Stein was in his office in Philadelphia , trying to hold together the pieces of his greatest triumph . The Supplemental Security Income program still exists within the Social Security Administration . As a result of the 1996 welfare-reform act , 150,000 children were removed from it . There was almost no news coverage until stories began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program . In the fall of 1997 , Congress got involved-Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota was particularly tough on the issue-and the SSA reevaluated these cases , reversing its decision in about a third , or 50,000 , of them . Once , programs like SSI were considered a part of some national obligation . Once again , though , the poor became a burden . In the 1990s and throughout the 1990s and continuing today , applicants faced a tacit presumption-and occasionally an outright accusation-that they were attempting to work the system . The act of applying for a government benefit became prima facie evidence of trickery and fraud . The whole program stank of the urban legend of crazy checks . Acceptance rates of SSI applications have declined since the early nineties , and they remain low . According to the latest figures from the Social Security Administration , from August 1996 through the end of last July , there were nearly 900,000 new applications for the SSI program . Of these , 50,000 were denied . ALMOST A YEAR AFTER MARCUS DIED , HIS grandparents had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Elder Henry Finley was there , proud of his new brick church out by the feed mill . Patsy Livingston and Judy Brown were still teaching at the New Albany Middle School . Myrtle Riddle was still making uniforms out at the Landau plant . The larger world had spun on , heedless and reckless . What was left was the little world of Marcus Stephens and a tiny cemetery from which you can not see even the lights of a city . They were all talking about the funeral that Elder Finley had preached for Marcus . " It was him , " Judy Brown recalled . " There was music and shouting and celebrating . That was Marcus , all right . " Myrtle broke down once , talking about the Christmas tree , and her husband took her gently from the room . Eventually , the Riddles got a lawyer , a legal-services attorney who largely stayed away from the few reporters who were interested in the story for fear that she 'd lose her own job if she was publicly identified with the case . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared to the public to be overly enthusiastic about their jobs . Even so , she forced the Social Security Administration to examine Marcus 's file , and there was the note from Dr. Chase and all the rest of the documentation that had made the last days of Marcus Stephens so brutally absurd , and the Riddles eventually got all the SSI money they would 've received had he not been cut off while he was dying . They used some of it for his headstone , and to pay back some of what they owed their friends . " I 'm not worried about me or Marcus , " said Sammie Riddle as night enveloped Brookwood Avenue . " Because he always told me he 'd look out for me with God . Marcus 'd set me a clean place in heaven for myself . " <p>
