A native of Arlington , Virginia , Benjamin Rosenbaum now lives in Basel , Switzerland with his wife Esther and their baby daughter Aviva . He says he survived several years of working on multimedia and Internet startups in the US before heading overseas , where he is now employed as a programmer in the banking industry . This savvy story-his first freelance sale-shows that he learned a trick or three during his days on the electronic frontier . <p> SHEILA SPLIT OPEN AND THE air was filled with gumballs . Yellow gumballs . This was awful for Stan , just awful . He had loved Sheila for along time , fought for her heart , believed in their love until finally she had come around . They were about to kiss for the first time and then this : yellow gumballs . Stan went to a group to try to accept that Sheila was gone . It was a group for people whose unrequited love had ended in some kind of surrealist moment . There is a group for everything in California . After several months of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to open a shop and sell the thousands of yellow gumballs . He did this because he believed in capitalism , he loved capitalism . He loved the dynamic surge and crash of Amazon 's stock price , he loved the great concrete malls spreading across America like blood staining through a handkerchief , he loved how everything could be tracked and mirrored in numbers . When he closed the store each night he would count the gumballs sold , and he would determine his gross revenue , his operating expenses , his operating margin ; he would adjust his balance sheet and learn his debt to equity ratio ; and after this exercise each night , Stan felt he understood himself and was at peace , and he could go home to his apartment and drink tea and sleep , without shooting himself or thinking about Sheila . On the night before the IPO of gumballs.com , Sheila came to Stan in a dream . She was standing in a kiddie pool ; Stan and his brothers and sisters were running around splashing and screaming ; she had managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's family , shot in the late 70 's . She looked terribly sad . " Sheila , where are you ? " Stan said . " Why did you leave me , why did you become gumballs ? " " The Ant King has me , " Sheila said . " You must rescue me . " Stan woke up , he shaved , he put on his Armani suit and drove his Lexus to his appointment with his venture capitalists and investment bankers . But the dream would not leave him . " Ant King ? " he asked himself . " What 's this about a goddamn Ant King ? " On the highway , near the swamp , he pulled his Lexus over to the shoulder . The American highway is a self-contained system , Stan thought . Its rest stops have video games , bathrooms , restaurants , and gas stations . There 's no reason ever to leave the interstate highway system , its deadness and perfection and freedom . When you do reach your exit , you always have a slight sense of loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his shiny black shoes and argyle socks , cuffed his Armani suit pants above the knees , and waded through the squidgy mud and tall reeds of the swamp . He saw a heron rise , flutter , and soar into the midmorning sky . Ant King , Ant King , he thought . Miles underground , the Ant King was watching an old episode of Charlie 's Angels on cable . " Which one do you identify with ? " he asked Sheila . " The blonde one , or the pretty brunette one , or the perky , smart brunette one ? " " Stan may come rescue me , you know , " Sheila said . " I like how you never see Charlie . And how Boswell - is that his name , Boswell ? - how he 's kind of a foil and audience for the girls . There 's all this unrealized desire - Boswell desires the girls , but he 's got no chance , and I think they desire Charlie , but Charlie 's invisible . " Sheila picked at a seam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He might come rescue me . " The Ant King blinked and tried to smile reassuringly . " Sure . No , yeah , definitely . I think the two of you are just going through a phase , maybe . You know , it took him a while to deal with , ah , what he 's going through . " Sheila glared at him . " You are so full of shit ! " she said . The Ant King threw his bag of Doritos at her . " Fine ! I was just trying to be nice ! " he shouted . " I 'm full of shit ? I 'm full of shit ? What about your dorky boyfriend ? " He grabbed the remote and changed the channel , showing Stan , sitting in his Lexus with the door open , toweling off his muddy feet . " He 's a lost cause , baby . You want me to respect a guy like that ? " " I hate it here , " said Sheila . The Ant King smoothed his antennae and took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing the Doritos . Maybe I overreacted . Okay ? " " I hate you , too , " said Sheila . " Fine , " said the Ant King , savagely snatching up the remote control and turning back to Charlie 's Angels . " Be that way . " " Gumballs are more than candy , is n't that right , Stan ? " said Monique , smiling broadly . Stan nodded . His feet were still wet , inside his argyle socks . " Yes , gumballs have a lot of , ah , a lot greater significance than just candy . " Monique paused and looked at Stan brightly , waiting for him to go on . Across the table , the three Credit Suisse First Boston underwriters , Emilio Toad , Harry Hornpecker , and Moby Pfister , sat stone-faced and unreacting in their gray double-breasted suits . Stan tried to remember the gumballs.com business plan . " They have hard shells , " he said . " People , ah , they want challenge ... the hardness , the gumminess .... " Monique broke in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Monique , always dressed to the nines and tens ; Monique was a Valley legend for her instincts , her suavity , her rapacious , exemplary greed . Stan had sold Monique on the idea of gumballs.com , and she had invested - found him the right contacts , the right team - and here they were at the Big Day , the Exit Strategy . " Stan ! " she cried joyously , fixing him with a penetrating stare . " Do n't be shy ! Tell them about how gumballs are sex ! Tell them about our top-gun semiotics professors , tell them about gumballs as a cultural trope ! You see , " she said , swooping onto Hornpecker , Pfister , &; Toad , " you ca n't think of this as a candy thing , a food &; bev thing , a consumer cyclic thing , no way , Jose ! Think Pokemon . Think World Wide Wrestling . Think Star Wars ! " " Could we get back to the numbers , " said Emilio Toad in a voice that sounded like a cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Harry Hornpecker and Moby Pfister twitched in relief . Later , after the deals were signed and the faxes were faxed , Monique and Stan took a taxi to a cigarillo bar to celebrate . " What , like , is up with you today ? " said Monique , crouched somewhat uncomfortably in the taxicab , her knees almost touching her chin , but exuding her usual sense of style and unflappability . " Um ... just IPO jitters ? " said Stan hopefully . " Cut the crap , " said Monique . " I had a dream about Sheila , " Stan blurted out . " Oh goddess , " said Monique . " Not this again . " " It seemed so real , " Stan said . " She said I had to rescue her from the Ant King . " " Well , you 're not my only weirdo CEO , " Monique said , giving him a manly , sidearm hug , " but I think you 're the weirdest . " The next morning , nursing a cognac hangover and a throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a two-story building in downtown Palo Alto . It looked a lot like where he worked . There on the signboard were the other companies in his building : Leng Hong Trading , Trusty &; Spark , patent attorneys ; the Bagel Binge , marketing department ; MicroChip Times , editorial . But no gumballs.com , Inc . " I thought you might be here , sir , " said Pringles , his secretary , appearing at his elbow . " Huh ? Pringles ! " said Stan . The day before , Pringles had been dressed in a black T-shirt reading " Your Television Is Already Dead " and twelve earrings , but now she was in a smart ochre business suit , carried a mahogany-colored briefcase , and wore pearls . " We 've moved , sir , " she said , leading the way to the limousine . On the highway to Santa Clara , something occurred to Stan . " Pringles ? " he said . " Yes , sir ? " " You did n't use to call me sir - you used to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've gone public now . SEC regulations . " " You 're kidding , " said Stan . Pringles stared out the window . THE GUMBALLS.COMBUILDING was thirty stories of mirrored glass windows with its own exit off Highway 101 . A forty-foot cutout of the corporate animated character , Mr. Gumball , towered over Stan , exuding yellow hysteria . Pringles escorted Stan to his office suite on the thirtieth , after giving him a building pass . " Wow , " said Stan , looking at Pringles across his enormous glass desktop . " Nice work , Pringles . " " Thank you , sir . " " So what 's my schedule for today ? " " Nothing lined up , sir . " " Nothing ? " " No , sir . " " Oh . Could I look at the numbers ? " " I 'll order them from Accounting , sir . " " Ca n't I just ask Bill ? " " Sir , Bill is the CFO of a public company now . He does n't have time to look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a staff meeting with the department heads or whatever ? " " Vic is doing that , sir . " " Vic ? Who 's Vic ? " " Vic is our Executive Vice President for Operations , sir . " " He is ? " " Yes , sir . " Stan looked at his desk . There were gold pens , a golden tape dispenser , a framed picture of Sheila , and a glass jar full of yellow gumballs . They were the last of the Sheila gumballs . " Pringles ? " Stan said . " Yes , sir ? " " I do n't have a computer . " " That 's right , sir . " There was a pause . " Anything else , sir ? " " Um , yeah . Pringles , what do you suggest I do today ? " Pringles turned and walked across the expanse of marble floor to a teak closet with a brass doorknob . She opened it and returned with a leather golfing bag , which she leaned against the glass desk . " Pringles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You need to learn , sir , " said Pringles , and left . Stan took a gumball from the glass jar and looked at it . He thought about biting into it , chewing it , blowing a bubble . Or at least sucking on it . I really should try one of these sometime , he thought . He looked at Sheila 's picture . He put the gumball in the pocket of his Armani suit jacket . Then he went to look for Vampire . " Hi , " said Stan , looking around a comer of a cubicle on the seventeenth floor . " I 'm Stan . " " Yeah , whatever , " said the occupant of the cubicle , not looking away from her monitor . " No , really , I 'm Stan , I 'm the CEO here . " " Yeah , I believe you , so ? What do you want , a medal ? " " Well , uh , " Stan said . " So what are you up to ? " " I 'm storyboarding the Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadline , and I 'm paid shit , Mr. CEO . " " Oh , okay , " said Stan . " I wo n't bug you then . " " Great , " said the cartoon storyboardist . " Hey , by the way , you do n't know where the sysadmins and stuff are though , do you ? " Stan asked . " I thought you were n't going to bug me , then . " After many such adventures , Stan found himself in the third subbasement of the gumballs.com building , close to despair . It was eight P.M. , and his building pass expired at nine . Suddenly , faintly , from far off , Stan heard the sound of horrible , ghostly shrieking and rhythmic pounding . Thank God , Stan thought , heading toward the sound . And indeed , as he got closer he could tell he was listening to one of Vampire 's thrash goth trance doom CDs . Stan had feared that , like Pringles , Vampire might suddenly be wearing a suit , but as he emerged into Vampire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee-length jet-black hair , a black trenchcoat , fingerless studded leather gloves , and giant surgical-steel ear , nose , lip , and tongue piercings , as always . Perhaps he was surrounded by an even larger array of keyboards , monitors , and machines than yesterday , but it was hard to tell . " Vampire ! " Stan shouted over the music . " Am I glad to see you ! " " Hey , man , " said Vampire , lifting a hand in salutation but not looking away from his monitor . " So , hey , what are you up to ? " said Stan , looking for somewhere to sit down . He started to take a broken monitor off of a folding metal chair . " DO N'T TOUCH THAT ! " Vampire shouted . " Oops , oops , sorry , " said Stan , backing off . " No problem , " said Vampire . " So , ah , you were saying ? " Stan said hopefully . " Lotta new machines coming in , " said Vampire . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servers ? " " Absolutely nothing , " said Stan . " Okay , " said Vampire , and nodded . Stan waited a little while , looking around . Finally he spoke again . " Ah , Vampire , ever heard of a , the , this is going to sound silly but , the Ant King ? " " Nope , " said Vampire . " I knew an Ant-Agonist once , on the Inferno BBS . " " Oh , " said Stan . " But , um , how would you go about finding out about the Ant King ? " " What search engines have you tried ? " asked Vampire . " Well , none , " said Stan . " Well , try Google , they 're good . " " Okay , " said Stan . " Um , Vampire ? " " Yeah ? " " I do n't have a computer anymore . " Vampire turned and looked at Stan . " You poor bastard ! " he said , and pointed . " Use that one . " The Ant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr Pepper littered around him . Sheila got up gingerly , took off her sneakers , and held them in one hand as she crept for the door , clutching a Dorito in the other . It was a lucky moment . Sheila passed several of the Ant King 's henchmen ( who were all bald and stout and wore identical purple fedoras ) asleep at their desks , and threaded her way through the dark rooms of the Ant King 's lair to the tunnels at the edge of it . She stopped at the mouth of the biggest tunnel . Far off , she could hear running water . Something moved in the darkness beyond , a great hulking shape . Sheila moved cautiously forward . With a horrible dry clicking and rustling , the gigantic Black Roach of Death scuttled forward . With trembling hands , Sheila fed it the Dorito , as she had seen the Ant King do , and reached up to pat its enormous antennae . Then she slid past it into the passageway . She walked forward , into the darkness . Ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bubble . The bubble popped , echoing loudly in the tunnel . Sheila froze . But there was no movement from behind . Carefully she spat the wad of gum into her hand and pressed it into the wall . Then she moved forward . Thirty steps . I can do this , she thought . Forty . Suddenly Sheila was terribly hungry . I 'll eat when I get out , she thought grimly . But that did n't seem quite right . She searched her pockets and found another Dorito . She lifted it to her lips and stopped . No . No , not that . Something was troubling her . She let the Dorito fall to the ground . I did n't prepare properly for this , she thought . This is n't the way you escape . You need a plan , you need resources . Anyway , there 's no rush . She began creeping back down the tunnel . It 's not so bad here anyway , she thought . I 'm all right for now . I 'll escape later . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Black Roach of Death idly as she passed . Damn Stan anyway , she thought as she crept back through the dark rooms . Am I supposed to do this all by myself ? That guy ! Big talker , but no action . On the TV , some CNN talking head was upset about market valuations . " Ten billion for gumballs ? This is the perfect example of market froth ! I mean there 's no business model , there are no barriers to entry ; only in today 's .... " Sheila switched to MTV and sank into the couch next to the Ant King . " Hi , " said the Ant King drowsily . " Hi , " said Sheila . " Hey , I missed you , " said the Ant King . " Stick it in your ear , " said Sheila . " Listen , your ambivalence about me is really getting old , Sheila , " said the Ant King . " Ambivalence about you ? Dream on , " said Sheila . She took a yellow gumball from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth , and bit down . A crunch , a rush of sweetness , the feeling of her teeth sinking into the gumball 's tough flesh . Sheila smiled and blew a bubble . It popped . She was n't hungry anymore . " I hate your guts , " she said . " Yeah , whatever , " said the Ant King , rolling over and pulling a pillow over his head . " Grow up , Sheila . " THE SEARCH ON Google.com had returned several bands and music CDs , an episode of the King of the Hill cartoon , the " Lair of the Ant King " slide at the local waterpark , and several video games in which the Ant King was one of the villains to beat . Stan listened to the CDs in his car , watched the cartoon in a conference room with a video projector , and installed the video games on a receptionist 's computer on the fifth floor and played them at night , hiding from the security guards . He popped down to visit Vampire a lot , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on level five , " he said , " and I just ca n't get past the Roach . " " And you 've still got the magic sword ? " said Vampire , not looking up . " No , I lost that to the Troll . " " You do n't even have to go to the Troll , " said Vampire , who never played video games but read the video game newsgroups religiously . " You can cross the Dread Bridge instead . " " I always die on the Dread Bridge when it breaks in two . " " You 're not running fast enough , " said Vampire . " You 've got to run as fast as you can , and jump at the last moment . " " It 's tough , " said Stan . Vampire shrugged . " How are things with you ? " Stan asked . " The patch for mod-ssl 1.2.4.2 is totally incompatible with the recommended build sequence for Apache on Solaris . Solaris is such crap . " " Oh , " said Stan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Vampire said . " What ? " said Stan . " That , " said Vampire , pointing . On top of a rack of dusty computers Stan saw a four-foot-long sword in a gilded leather sheath . Its ivory handle depicted a spiral of crawling ants . Stan pulled the sword a little out of its sheath , and an eerie blue light filled the room . " Cool , huh ? " said Vampire . " I got it on eBay . " Holding his magic sword , Stan left the elevator on the thirtieth floor and cautiously approached his office . He had n't been there in a week ; he felt like he should check in . Pringles met him at the door . " This is n't your office anymore , sir , " she said . " It 's not ? " Stan said . He tried to hold the sword at an inconspicuous angle . Pringles ignored it . " No , sir . We moved Vic in there . " " Oh , really ? Say , when do I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure , sir . He 's quite busy these days , with our acquisition of Suriname . " " We 're acquiring Suriname ? Is n't that a country ? " " Yes , sir . Follow me , please . " " Um , Pringles , " said Stan , hurrying to catch up . " Am I , ah , still CEO ? " Pringles opened the door of his new office . It was a lot smaller . " I 'll check with HR , sir , " she said , and left . That afternoon , as Stan sat at his new , smaller desk , Monique stopped by . " Hey hey , " she said , " so here 's where they 've got you , huh ? " " Monique , what 's going on ? Have I been , um , usurped ? " It seemed like the wrong word . " Oh , I would n't worry about it , tiger , " she said , sinking into a leather visitor 's chair , and crossing her legs . " Gumballs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you should be proud . " " But Monique - I do n't do anything anymore . " " Oh , stop whining , " Monique said . She rolled her eyes . " God , you make such a big deal out of everything . Cool sword . " " Thanks , " said Stan glumly . " Look , you 're a startup-stage guy , not an operations-stage guy . Just enjoy the ride . " " I guess , " said Stan . " There you go . Listen , you clearly need cheering up . I 'm babysitting my sister 's kid on the weekend , we 're going to the water park . You wan na come ? " " Sure , " said Stan . " Why not ? " Monique came by Stan 's apartment Saturday morning , and Stan came outside , dressed in a blue Oxford and chinos and carrying a bathing suit and towel , and his magic sword . Monique was wearing a silver blouse , a blue miniskirt , a silk scarf and sunglasses . Her sister 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black lipstick and kohl , and was wearing combat boots and a wedding dress adorned with black spiders . " Stan , this is Corpse , my sister 's kid , " Monique said . " Hi , " said Stan . Corpse snarled , like a wolf . " Great , everybody ready ? " said Monique . In the car , Stan said , " So , Corpse , what 's your favorite subject in school ? " " Shop , " said Corpse . " Aha , " said Stan . " And what do you want to do when you grow up ? " " Bring about the violent overthrow of the current political order , " said Corpse . " Really ? How come ? " asked Stan . Corpse 's eyes rolled back into their sockets , exposing the white . " Takes after me , do n't you , Corpse ? " said Monique happily . Corpse said nothing . " But Monique , " said Stan . " You 're a venture capitalist . You are the current political order . " Monique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope you do n't mind me asking this , but ah , are you a boy or a girl ? " " You teleological totalitarian ! " Corpse shouted . " Your kind will be first up against the wall when the revolution comes ! " " Now , Corpse , be nice , " said Monique . But she was grinning . STAN STOOD in line for the water slide , in his bathing suit , behind Corpse , who was still wearing the wedding dress . He had left his sword in the locker room . He felt naked without it . Corpse sat in the mouth of the water slide tunnel , waiting for the " Go " light to turn green . Stan looked over at the slide to his left . It was a boat ride ; in a puffy inflatable boat , four stout , bald men in business suits and purple fedoras sat waiting for the green light . Behind them was a Mexican family in bathing suits , waiting with their boat . That 's funny , Stan thought . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a glass jar filled with perhaps three hundred yellow gumballs . The fights turned green ; Corpse vanished into the slide and the men in the boat slid into their tunnel . Despite the sign reading ONE AT A TIME , WAIT FOR THE GREEN LIGHT , Stan jumped in after Corpse . Halfway through the twists , turns , splashing chaos of the tunnel , Stan collided with Corpse . " Hey ! " Corpse yelled , and was sucked away again . Stan was dumped out into a great basin . He went under and came up spluttering , chlorine stinging his nose . Standing unsteadily , he looked over at the end of the boat ride . There was no sign of the men with the fedoras : the water there flowed peacefully . " Hey ! " said Corpse , splashing him . " You 're not supposed to go two at once ! " " I thought you wanted to overthrow the current political order , " said Stan , still watching the boat ride . " Oh , right , so let 's start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why not ? " said Stan . The Mexican family , in their boat , emerged from the boat ride . There was no question : the other boat had vanished while in the tunnel . Monique was standing next to the basin in her polka-dot bikini , yelling into her pink waterproof cell phone . " No , you idiot , I do n't want you profitable ! Because we ca n't find backers for a profitable company , that 's why ! Well find something to spend it on ! " She clicked off the cell phone and shook her head . " Some people are so stuck in the Old Economy . " " Can I borrow that ? " Stan asked . " Okay , " Monique said , handing him the phone . " Do n't lose it . " " Meet me at the boat ride in five minutes , " Stan said , and dialing Vampire , hurried off to get his sword . The light turned green , and the boat containing Monique , Corpse , and Stan , holding his magic sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ? " shouted Stan into the pink cell phone over the roar of rushing water . The boat surged through the great pipe , spun into a whirlpool , then rushed on . " Yeah , " said Vampire , over the cell phone . " It was n't easy , but I 'm in . Actually , after I cracked the session key it was n't that bad , they 've got a continuous telnet session going over a Pac Bell router , so ..... " The boat lurched and heaved to the right and a cascade of water flew over them . Stan shouted , " So , did you , you know , open the secret door or whatever ? " " Oh , right , " said Vampire , and typed a command to the water park 's main computer , setting the " Lair of the Ant King " ride into " real " mode . The rubber boat rushed into a curve . In front of them , a section of wall swung away and the boat flew out of the pipe , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This ride is cool ! " said Corpse , as they fell . When the boat hit the great subterranean river below , it bucked , and Monique and Corpse grabbed onto the handles set into its sides . Stan thought about whether to drop the pink cell phone or the magic sword , and while he thought about it , he flew out of the boat and disappeared into the icy rapids . " Stan ! " Monique yelled . " Bummer , " said Corpse . The surging river slowed as it widened , they glided past massive black cliffs , and at last the rubber boat coasted up to a dock , where several stout men in purple fedoras helped Monique and Corpse onto dry land . The Ant King bowed , and his antennae bobbed . " Well , this is an unexpected pleasure , " he said . " Cool lair , " said Corpse . " Why , thank you , " said the Ant King . " You both look soaked . We have robes and changing rooms right over here . Care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monique . " Got hot chocolate ? " said Corpse . " Why , yes , we do , " said the Ant King . " Okay , there 's a little yellow bird here , " Stan said . " You still got the rod ? " said Vampire over the pink cell phone . Stan looked down at the crook of his arm , where he was uncomfortably carrying a rod , an axe , a loaf of bread , and a key . He was still in his bathing suit , dripping wet , and exhausted from wandering the tunnels for hours . The blue glow of his magic sword dimly illuminated the room , including a small yellow bird , which watched him suspiciously . " Put the rod down , " said Vampire . Stan let it slide out from the crook of his arm and clatter to the ground . " Now catch the bird , " Vampire said . With the pink cell phone wedged between his ear and his shoulder , and his collection of found objects in the crook of his sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him dubiously , and hopped away . " I ca n't seem to get ahold of it , " Stan said . " All right , forget the bird . It 's only extra points anyway . " " Extra points ! " shouted Stan . " I 'm not trying to get extra points , I 'm trying to get Sheila ! " " Okay , okay , keep your hat on , " said Vampire . " Get the rod again and go north . " While Stan wandered a maze of twisty little passages , leaving found objects and pieces of bread according to Vampire 's instructions , in order to differentiate the rooms from one another and thus navigate the maze , and Corpse and Monique changed into fuzzy purple terrycloth bathrobes , and Sheila watched the Comedy Channel and felt inexplicably restless , the Ant King logged onto a network and sent a message , which appeared in the corner of Vampire 's screen . Think you 're pretty smart , huh ? it said . " Okay , " said Stan , " uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Hold on , " said Vampire . " Message . " He did some tracking to find out where the message came from , but no luck : he found a circular trail of impossible addresses . I know I 'm pretty smart , he typed back at it . Not as smart as you think , the Ant King typed back at him . You think I would leave sendmail running on an open port on my real proxy server ? As if I did n't know about the security hole in that baby . " Okay , I think I see the way out here , " said Stan . " This is the room with the two pieces of bread - have I gone east from here ? " " Hold on a sec , " muttered Vampire . " I do n't think I have , " said Stan . Okay , I 'm stumped , typed Vampire . If that 's not your real proxy server , what is it ? It 's my Palm Pilot , the Ant King typed back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're hogging a lot of memory on it , so I 'd appreciate it if you logged off , Vampy . Hey , hold on , Vampire typed . Is this Ant-Agonist ? Used to be . Not anymore , typed the Ant King . " Hey , I 'm out ! " Stan said . " It 's opening up into a large cavern . Wow , this is great , Vampire ! " No shit ! typed Vampire . How have you been , man ? I 've been great , but I ca n't say the same for you , typed the Ant King . You are rusty as hell . What are you doing selling gumballs for a living anyway ? " Oh , shit , " said Stan . " Oh , shit ! " " What ? " said Vampire curtly , typing furiously in the chat window . " Vampire , it 's the bridge . It 's the Dread Bridge ! I always die at the Dread Bridge . " " I told you , man , " Vampire said , absently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've just got ta run fast enough . " CELL PHONE IN one hand , sword in the other , Stan began to run . His bare feet slapped against the planks of the Dread Bridge ; the bridge swung crazily over the chasm , and he fought for balance . As he neared the middle he threw the sword ahead of him , and it clattered onto the ground beyond the bridge . He stuffed the cell phone into the waistband of his bathing suit , and ran on . Suddenly he heard a snap behind him , and he jumped . The bridge broke beneath his weight , and swung away . Stan flew through the air , but not nearly far enough ; he fell , and barely managed to grab the planks of the bridge beneath him . He hung on as the ropes strained ; he thought they were going to break , and he screamed in terror . But the ropes held . Stan swung over the dark canyon , clutching the planks . " Hey , are you okay ? " Vampire said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think so . " " Great , " Vampire said . " Listen , I know this is kind of a bad time , but there 's something we need to talk about . " " Huh ? " said Stan . " What ? " " Well , this is kind of awkward for me , but , you know , I have n't really been feeling fulfilled professionally here lately .... " " What ? " said Stan . " So , well , I 've decided to accept another offer of employment , basically . " " You 're kidding , " said Stan . " From whom ? " " From the Ant King , actually . I 'm pretty excited about it , it 's a whole different level of responsibility , and - " " The Ant King ? ! " yelled Stan . " The Ant King ? ! " " Yeah , actually it turns out I know him from way back and - " " But Vampire ! " yelled Stan . " Listen , are n't we in this together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let 's not make this hard on ourselves , okay ? This is just the career move I think is right for me right now .... " " Vampire , we can give you more responsibility ! " Stan could feel the cool air of the endless chasm blowing against his feet . " More stock ! Whatever you want ! " " That 's great of you to offer , Stan , really , " said Vampire . " But , you know , it 's getting really corporate here , and that 's just not my scene . I think I 'll be happier in a more entrepreneurial climate . " " But Vampire ! " Stan shouted , and just then the ropes above him groaned and one snapped , and the planks he was holding onto twisted and spun . Stan was slammed against the wall , and the pink cell phone popped out of his waistband and fell into the darkness . He waited , but he never heard it reach the ground . Crap , he thought , and began to climb the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the Ant King . " Exactly ! Wile E. Coyote is the only figure of any integrity in twentieth-century literature . " " Totally , " said Corpse . " Come on , " said Monique . " What about Bugs Bunny ? " " An amateur ! " said the Ant King . " A dilettante ! No purity of intention ! " " Pinky and the Brain ? " " Losers ! Try to take over the world , indeed ! " Sheila cleared her throat . " Um , does anyone want some more pretzels ? " she asked . " Are you the one we 're here to rescue ? " Corpse asked . Sheila blanched . " Yeah , she 's the one , " said the Ant King . " So listen - Star Trek or Star Wars ? " " Oh , please , " said Corpse . " Babylon 5 ! " " Excellent choice ! " said the Ant King . " I like Star Wars . Particularly Darth Vader , " said Monique . " I 'll just go for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But then he baits on the Dark Side in the end ! " the Ant King said . " See ? No integrity ! " Cold and angry , clutching his magic sword in both hands , Stan stood before the gigantic Black Roach of Death . " Come on , big boy , " he yelled . " Make my day ! Meet my sword , Roach Motel ! You 're gon na check in , but you 're not gon na check - " With a lazy swipe of its great claws , the Roach batted the magic sword out of Stan 's hands . It flew away and clattered into the darkness . Then the Roach grabbed Stan around the throat and lifted him high into the air . " Eek ! " Stan screamed in terror . " He 's a friend of mine , " yelled Sheila , sprinting out of the darkness . " Sheila ! " choked Stan . " Here , c'm on boy , put him down , here 's a Dorito , " Sheila said . Reluctantly the Roach dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petted , and crawled back into the tunnel . " Thanks , " croaked Stan , as Sheila helped him up . Hand in hand , Sheila and Stan made their way through the tunnels leading away from the Ant King 's lair . " Do n't look back , " Stan kept saying . " Okay ? Do n't look back . " " Okay already , " Sheila said . Suddenly Sheila stopped . " What ? " said Stan , careful not to look back at her . " I 'm , um , I 'm hungry , " said Sheila . " Me too , " said Stan . " Let 's go . " " But listen , we could just sneak back and grab a bite to eat , right ? I mean , I ran out here because I heard you were finally coming , but I would 've packed a sandwich if I 'd - " " Sheila , are you nuts ? " said Stan . " What 's that supposed to mean ? " said Sheila . Stan felt in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one had something in it - a gumball . Dry . He pulled it out and squinted at it in the dimness . He remembered putting a gumball into the pocket of his suit jacket , but .... " Okay , so I 'm going back , " Sheila said . " Quick , chew this , " Stan said , handing the gumball back to her without looking back . She chewed the gumball , and they walked onward through the tunnel . " I never thought I 'd say this , " said the Ant King , stirring his espresso nervously . " Sheila will be angry , but - well , how can I put this - " " Spit it out already , " Monique said . " Yeah , " Corpse said . " Corpse , I just - I feel like you really get me , you know ? " " Yeah , " Corpse said softly . " I feel the same way . " Monique whistled . " Would you ... " the Ant King blushed . " Would you like to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depths ? " " Wow , that would be totally awesome ! " Corpse said . " Oh god , your mother 's going to kill me , " Monique said . " Oh come on , Aunt Monique , do n't turn into a hypocrite on me ! You always told me to follow my heart ! You always say it 's better to get into trouble than be bored ! " " I did n't say you ca n't do it , " said Monique . " I just said your mother 's going to kill me . " " So does that mean I can ? " asked Corpse . " How about if we do this on a trial basis at first , " Monique said . " Okay ? And you - " she pointed a menacing finger at the Ant King . " No addictive gumball crap , okay ? " His antennae stiffened in surprise . " Yeah , Aunt Monique knows more than you think . You watch your step , buddy . " She turned to Corpse . " You have one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your mom . Then you come back up and we talk it over . " " Oh gosh , thank you , Aunt Monique ! " " You have my word , " said the Ant King . " Corpse will enjoy life here thoroughly . And it will be very educational . " " I bet , " said Monique . " Hey , can we violently overthrow the current political order ? " Corpse asked . " Sure , " said the Ant King . " That sounds like fun . " EPILOGUE Stan sat across the desk from Lucy the HR person , who smiled at him brightly . " So what are your skills ? " she asked . " I founded this company , " he said . " We try to be forward-looking here , " she said . " Less progressive organizations are focused on past accomplishments , but our philosophy is to focus on current skills . What languages can you program in ? " " None , " said Stan . " I can use Microsoft Word , though " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm pretty good at financial analysis , " Stan said . " We are actually overstaffed in Accounting , " Lucy said . " I could work in Marketing , " Stan said . Lucy smiled indulgently . " Everyone thinks they know how to do Marketing . What about Customer Service ? " " I think I 'll pass , " said Stan . " Okay , " Lucy said brightly . " Well , I 'll let you know as soon as something else opens up . Gumballs.com cares about you as an employee . We want you to know that , and we want you to enjoy your indefinite unpaid leave . Can you do that for me , Stan ? " " I 'll try , " said Stan , and he left . Stan finally met Vic at the company Christmas party in San Francisco . As he expected , Vic was tall , blond , and athletic , with a tennis smile . " Stan ! " Vic said brightly . " Good to finally meet you . And this must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking hands . " Hi , Vic , " said Stan . " Listen , I .... " " Great dress , " Vic said to Sheila . " Thanks ! " Sheila said . " So what 's running the show like ? " Stan said , " I wanted to .... " " It 's actually quieted down a bunch , " Vic said . " I 'm starting to have time for a little golf and skiing . " Stan said , " I was wondering if we could .... " " Wow ! " said Sheila . " Where do you ski ? " " Tahoe , " said Vic . " Of course , " laughed Sheila . Stan said , " Maybe if we could take a few minutes .... " " So is your wife here ? " Sheila asked . Vic laughed . " No , I 'm afraid I 'm single . " " Wow , are you gay ? " Sheila asked . " About 80-20 straight , " Vic said . " Hey , me too ! " Sheila said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here at .... " " But really , I just have n't found anyone I 've clicked with since moving to the Bay Area , " Vic said . " I know what you mean ! " Sheila said . Stan said , " Because I have some ideas about how I could .... " " So where were you before the Bay Area ? " Sheila asked . Later Sheila came up to Stan at the punch bowl . " Stan , you know , things have n't been going so great for us lately . " " Uh huh , " Stan said . " I want you to know , I really appreciate you rescuing me .... " " Hey , no problem , " Stan said . " But since then , it just seems like we are n't going anywhere , you know ? " " Sheila , I love you , " said Stan . " I 'd give my life for you . I 've never found anything in my life that means anything to me , except you . " " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And maybe I 'm being a bitch , but you know , that 's kind of hard to live up to . You know ? And I 'm just not there yet . " She put her arms around him . He stiffened . She let go and sighed . " I just think .... " " Are you going to run off with Vic ? " Stan said . " Just give it to me straight . " Sheila sighed . " Yeah , " she said . " Yeah , I guess I am . I 'm sorry . " " Me too , " Stan said . Stan left the party and walked to the Bay Bridge . He looked down into the black water . He thought about jumping , but he did n't really feel like dying . He just did n't feel like being him anymore . He decided to become a bum and walked to South of Market , where he traded his suit , shoes , and wallet for an army jacket , a woolen cap , torn jeans , sneakers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle of Night Train in a paper bag . But he was n't a good bum . He was too polite to panhandle , he did n't like the taste of Night Train , and at campfires he felt alienated from the other bums - he did n't know any of the songs they liked , and they did n't want to talk about Internet stocks . He was hungry , cold , lonely , tired , and sober when Monique found him . " You look like shit , " she said . " Go away , Monique , " he said . " I 'm a bum now . " " Oh , yeah ? " said Monique . " And how 's that working out ? " " Lousy , " Stan admitted . Monique got out of her BMW and squatted down next to where Stan lay . The other bums moved away , rolling their eyes and shaking their heads in disgust . " I 've lost everything I love , " Stan said . " Are n't you the guy who loved the dramatic surge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malls spreading across America like blood staining a handkerchief ? How everything can be tracked and mirrored in numbers - numbers , the lifeblood of capitalism ? " " Well , yeah , " Stan said . " Get in the car , " Monique said . " You 're hired . " Stan got in the car .
