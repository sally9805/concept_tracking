<p> A decade after laying down their arms , the Contras and the Sandinistas are squaring off in an election that could return Daniel Ortega to power . But no matter who wins , few expect an end to Nicaragua 's economic misery . <p> On the northern edge of Managua squats the destitute barrio of Acahualinca , a jumble of dirt paths lined by decrepit one-room shacks without running water or indoor plumbing . Here , a few miles from the heart of Nicaragua 's capital , there is no commerce other than petty drug dealing . The economic center of the neighborhood is the municipal garbage dump , a massive field of waste that sprawls across 100 acres . On this afternoon in early June , a line of diesel trucks belch and dump their loads . Dozens of small fires fill the air with an acrid chemical smoke as scavengers , many of them children , sift through the waste for copper , aluminum , and other recyclables . Overhead a flock of buzzards circles in formation , The dump serves as home to hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood-and-metal shelters along the edges of the dump . The newly arrived make do with plastic or cloth lean-tos erected among the trash heaps . <p> Eddie Perez , a children 's advocate with a nonprofit group called Dos Generaciones , is picking his way through the mounds of garbage . " The government 's economic policy has only cut more and more services and jobs for the poor , " he says . " They hate us , really . The government policy is to try and make all of us , all this , invisible . " Perez nods to one of the younger scavengers . " A decade ago we thought we were going to get rid of child labor in the dump , " he adds . " But it did n't work out . Now we realize it was only a dream . " <p> Indeed , things were supposed to work out differently for all of Nicaragua . After decades of autocratic rule by the U.S.-backed Somoza family , a 1979 uprising put the revolutionary Sandinistas and their leader , Daniel Ortega , in power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sandinistas , branding them as a proCuban threat to the hemisphere . In 1990 , when war-weary Nicaraguans voted Ortega out of office and elected a pro-American administration , the United States promised massive economic aid and a new era of prosperity . <p> But 11 years later , Nicaragua is anything but a showcase for free-market democracy . After toppling the Sandinistas , the United States essentially abandoned Nicaragua , failing to deliver significant aid for reconstruction after the prolonged Contra war . The Washington-backed governments that succeeded the Sandinistas have meanwhile bled the country dry through widespread corruption . The nation remains one of the poorest in an impoverished region , its 5 million residents beset by hunger , crime , and unemployment . <p> As the economy has deteriorated , Nicaragua has remained mired in its political past . More than two decades after the Sandinistas toppled Somoza , the two sides remain the dominant political forces in Nicaragua . In presidential elections scheduled for November , the old guard is represented by Enrique Bolanos , a 73-year-old entrepreneur who was once jailed by the Sandinistas for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the man who imprisoned him , Daniel Ortega . <p> For much of the campaign , Ortega has actually been ahead in the polls , and many observers expect him to regain the presidency . But few in Nicaragua expect either candidate to ease the country 's economic misery . Bolanos is an ally of the current president , Arnoldo Aleman , who is accused of using his office to enrich himself and his business cronies at the nation 's expense . And the Frente Sandinista de Liberacion Nacional ( FSLN ) , led by Ortega , has largely abandoned its principles of social justice , recasting the party in the traditional Nicaraguan mold of political patronage and outright corruption . Over the past few years , Ortega has steamrollered internal opposition , expelled his own allies by the dozens , and forged a power-sharing pact with his right-wing rivals that effectively excludes smaller parties from the political system . The backroom deal also made Ortega a congressman for life  --  a position that conveniently provided him with immunity from prosecution just as he was facing charges of sexually molesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarmed the Bush administration , which dispatched diplomat Lino Gutierrez to Managua in June to rail against the front-runner . " Marxism is in the trash bin of history , " Gutierrez declared in a high-profile speech intended to discredit the Sandinistas . " No country can indulge in the luxury of going back to the past . " But given the current political landscape , the effort to cast Ortega as a Soviet-style menace strikes many Nicaraguans as laughable . " If the CIA had any brains , " says one political analyst in Managua , " they 'd have figured out by now that the Sandinistas not only do n't represent a Marxist threat , but that long ago the party was taken over by opportunistic yuppies . " <p> Beneath the cynicism , few in Nicaragua see any way out of the current plight . Many prominent Sandinistas have left the party , saying a victory by Ortega holds no promise of meaningful change . " We are in a dead-end tunnel with no light , " says Joaquin Cuadra , the former commander of the Sandinista army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are going head-on into an economic , social , and political crack-up . " <p> On the Patio of a stylish restaurant in Managua , across from the pyramid-like Hotel Intercontinental , Manuel Ignacio Lacayo sips a lemonade as his bodyguards stand watch off to the side . He may be the second- or third-richest man in Nicaragua  --  wealthy enough that all of his holdings were once confiscated by the Sandinistas . After Ortega was defeated , the government returned car dealerships , factories , and the local Coca-Cola bottling franchise . " I am very comfortable , obviously , " he says in flawless English . " But you would have to be pretty cold-blooded to enjoy life here amidst so much poverty . " <p> Since the Sandinista defeat of 1990 , Nicaragua has become , in the parlance of international lending institutions , " normalized . " The revolutionary murals and the Che Guevara statues have given way to a thin crust of globalized commercial culture . The streets of Managua are much cleaner now , the old ruins of the devastating 1972 earthquake finally bulldozed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cafe , and even two small shopping malls ( revered by the wealthy " Nicas ricas " as veritable temples ) line the newly paved roads . McDonald 's and Domino 's Pizza have eaten up some of the old taqueria stands , and a few casinos offer neon enticements . <p> But outside the five-star hotels , teenage hookers share sidewalk space with even younger Nicaraguans addicted to sniffing glue . With only 1 in 4 Nicaraguans claiming formal employment , young and old crowd the intersections , selling everything from towels , combs , and chewing gum to windshield wipers , cell-phone holders , and coconuts . Disabled war veterans  --  ex-Sandinistas and Contras alike-beg from their wheelchairs . Outside the palatial new headquarters of the Foreign Ministry , still under construction , barefoot kids stand on the scorching asphalt streets hawking little bags of drinking water , for a profit of less than a penny each . <p> Lacayo , known to all by his initials , MIL , shocked the nation in 1998 when he denounced President Aleman  --  and the business elite who support the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His defection was met with immediate reprisals : tax audits , red tape on his imports , and a cutoff of government contracts . MIL is now divesting himself of all his Nicaraguan holdings to make himself less vulnerable as he gets more deeply involved in opposition politics . His passion has been stirred by what he sees as unprecedented levels of neglect by Alemain . " That Nicaraguan business is inefficient and corrupt and that it does n't know how to make a profit except from government graft is really old news , " Lacayo says . " But never before has so little been dedicated to social spending and the poor . Even Somoza spent more on social services , and of course , so did the Sandinistas . " <p> Statistics back up his grim portrait . Three-fourths of the population survives on less than $2 a day . Those few with stable employment earn an average of $150 a month . A third of the population is illiterate , and 600,000 people are stalked by malnutrition . " Nicaragua 's traditional poverty is now turning into raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a political think tank in Managua . <p> Along the roadsides of the city , President Aleman and his Constitutional Liberal Party ( PLC ) have erected self-congratulatory billboards reading " Deeds-Not Words . " But the only deed for which Aleman has gained notoriety is his remarkable personal enrichment . The son of a Somocista judge , Aleman spent months in jail under Sandinista rule . In 1990 he was elected mayor of Managua , and in 1996 he defeated Ortega in the Sandinista 's first bid to regain the presidency . Since then , Aleman has become the embodiment of what Latin American politicos call " The Washington Consensus "  --  the conservative , democratic , free-market model vigorously promoted by the United States . He has dutifully slashed the country 's budget to meet harsh " structural adjustments " imposed by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , squeezing Nicaragua to pay the interest on its $6 billion in foreign debt . He has created a " business friendly " atmosphere for the opening of low-wage and nonunion Taiwanese- and American-owned maquiladora assembly plants . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Violeta Chamorro . <p> All this was anticipated by Aleman 's rightwing platform . What has not been explained is how he has come to own so much prime real estate during his years in public service . Or why he needs not one , but two heliports . Or how a new highway that is of little use just happens to cross three of his properties . <p> Estimating the extent of Aleman 's graft has become something of a national pastime . " What Aleman has stolen is at least in the tens of millions , " says one conservative business executive . Lacayo puts the figure at $60 million . " President Aleman is rumored to have said he wanted to skim a million dollars a month , " Lacayo says . " I find that figure quite plausible . " And a dissident congressman from Aleman 's own party says that Aleman 's wealth tops $250 million . " Even Somoza showed more respect for the citizenry , " Sergio Garcia Quintero told reporters , sounding a common refrain in Managua . " His criminal ethic had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constitution from holding consecutive terms , the Liberals are represented this year by Bolanos , one of his former vice presidents . A physical cross between Harry Truman and Junior Soprano , Bolanos inspires little confidence that he represents a change from Aleman 's policies . In his stump speech Bolanos promises an " austere government , " but as vice president he was noticeably silent on the financial scandals blossoming all around him . Nor does Bolanos offer much hope of bridging the yawning social and political chasms that divide Nicaragua . " I am a Contra , " he declared in a recent campaign speech . " I will be the first democratically elected Contra . And I will govern in their interests . " <p> Beyond such anti-Sandinista declarations , the PLC has little ground-level reality as a political party . On a recent Saturday morning , Bolanos supporters organized a campaign " caravan " through the dilapidated eastern neighborhoods of Managua . At the staging point , party officials in pressed chinos , polo shirts , and Ray-Bans busily organized the motorcade . Street gangs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marshaled pickup trucks and wave party flags . As the motorcade wound through the dank industrial barrios , sidewalk onlookers jeered and laughed . <p> The caravan arrived at the nearly deserted Calendaria Park , where another rent-a-crowd of impoverished Nicaraguans was packed into a school bus . Party officials brought a single Winnie the Pooh pinata to lure local families out from their dirt-floored shacks . When Bolanos showed up , the crowd was brought in to cheer him . Standing on the back of a sound truck , the candidate shouted a series of verbal jabs . His message was simple : Me  --  or the Sandinistas . " Knowing they have already lost , the Frente Sandinista does n't want elections ! Only we can guarantee peace in Nicaragua ! Vote for us to keep the peace ! Vote for us for jobs ! For housing ! For health care ! " Bolanos offered no details . After five minutes , he was whisked away in an armored SUV . His poll ratings remained stuck at about 30 percent . <p> The Corruption of the ruling party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandinistas , who stirred the poor into successful insurrection against the abuses and inequalities of the Somoza dictatorship . Once in power , the party seized large estates and distributed land to sharecroppers , raised wages , and enforced labor laws . The romance of the revolution packed a strong allure for a generation of social activists around the globe , attracting thousands of foreign " sandalista " volunteers who braved deprivation and armed Contra attacks as they harvested coffee or fanned out through the countryside , bringing medicine and education to the poor . The youthfulness of the Sandinista leadership , their embrace of popular culture , and their relative ideological flexibility as quasi-socialists burnished their image as a new breed of rock-'n ' - roll revolutionaries . Ortega himself had , perhaps , his greatest moment as a statesman on the night of his electoral defeat in 1990 . After delivering an emotional concession speech and rightfully claiming credit for bringing democracy to Nicaragua , he turned the government over to his political rivals  --  many of them armed enemies openly financed by a hostile foreign power . <p> Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resemble those they once vilified . In the brief interim between their election defeat and the inauguration of their successors , the Sandinistas scurried to grab a chunk of the state they had controlled . In what became known as La Pinata , the FSLN gobbled up 200 cattle and coffee farms , factories , and media outlets and privatized them behind an intricate array of offshore firms , many of them based in Panama . Many of the commandantes , most notably Daniel 's brother and former military chief Humberto Ortega , became powerful businessmen . The party elite were soon managing hotels , factories , even banks . " The Sandinistas have kidnapped our principles and betrayed our purest dreams , " says a middle-aged psychologist who fought in the anti-Somoza insurrection . <p> At the same time , the Soviet Union collapsed and Cuba plunged into economic free fall , leaving the Frente an ideological orphan . " The Sandinistas are the only party here with a real grassroots machinery , " says Carlos Fernando Chamorro , a former party member who edited Barricada , the now-defunct Sandinista @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is politically confused and for whom ideology is n't very important . Maybe they are free-marketeers , or maybe not . But more than anything , they are Danielistas . " <p> Ortega has done his part to promote his personal image . The old red-and-black billboards spouting Sandinista slogans have been replaced by bright yellow ones reading simply " Daniel ! " Ortega long ago hung up his stiffly ironed olive-drab military uniform ; he now prefers to campaign in blue jeans and blousy white short-sleeved shirts . At age 55 , he 's still trim and energetic , but suffers from heart ailments that send him to Havana for periodic treatment . While still praising Cuba , he often peppers his public speeches with references to Jesus . As president in the 1980s , responding to the Contra attacks , Ortega crisscrossed the countryside delivering rifles to the citizenry ; nowadays , his campaign rallies are likely to climax with Ortega standing on the back of a truck throwing out baseballs or rolls of toilet paper to onlookers desperate for such hard-to-find commodities . " Anyone who has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other type of property should feel secure , " he reassured wealthy voters at one campaign stop in June . " Because never again will there be confiscations in Nicaragua . " <p> Ortega lives in a Managua residence sealed off by eight-foot walls , razor wire , and manned guard turrets . His public life is equally closed . Ortega has crushed repeated attempts to democratize the FSLN , expelling internal critics and launching smear campaigns against outsiders . Many of the Frente 's most acclaimed members have walked out in protest , including Ortega 's former vice president Sergio Ramirez , former cabinet ministers Ernesto and Fernando Cardenal , the poet Gioconda Belli , and legendary guerrilla commander Dora Maria Tellez , who led the first insurgent troops into Managua . By the mid-1990s , the Sandinistas found themselves stripped of their dazzling intellectual firepower . <p> " Daniel today reminds me of Michael Corleone at the end of The Godfather Part II , " says a former bodyguard for a top Sandinista leader . " He has wiped out all his enemies and is all-powerful , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own party weakened , Ortega decided to cut a deal with his right-wing opponents . During the 1996 elections , with two dozen parties fielding candidates , neither the Sandinistas nor the Liberals was able to command a simple majority . So the two sides began a series of secret negotiations that concluded last year in constitutional reforms known simply as El Pacto . The deal  --  which is reportedly opposed by up to 70 percent of Nicaraguans  --  gave the two parties a virtual monopoly on the political system . Smaller parties were required to submit unattainable numbers of signatures to qualify for elections , essentially forcing them off the ballot , and candidates can now win the presidency with as little as 35 percent of the vote , eliminating the need to form alliances with minority parties . " Aleman and Daniel found common interest in dividing up the political system , " says Chamorro , the former Sandinista editor . <p> The deal did more than divvy up the government  --  it also granted former presidents Aleman and Ortega immunity from prosecution by making them lifelong congressmen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed from each other , " says Maria Lopez Vigil , a political analyst in Managua and editor of the respected journal El Envio . " They both needed a way to eliminate minority parties . And they both needed impunity . " <p> The pact was sealed last year just as Aleman faced calls for indictment on charges of corruption  --  and as Ortega was confronted by equally serious allegations . The Sandinista candidate 's need for immunity can be summed up in one word : Zoilamerica . The adopted stepdaughter of Ortega , 33-year-old Zoilamerica Narvaez Murillo is a direct descendant of the legendary guerrilla leader Augusto Sandino . A committed Sandinista activist , Narvaez rocked the nation in March 1998 when she accused Ortega of 20 years of sexual abuse , including rape , starting when she was 11 . The FSLN responded with a propaganda campaign smearing her as a CIA agent , mentally ill , and a lesbian . Narvaez , who was once married to one of Ortega 's closest advisers , countered by filing felony charges against her stepfather . <p> Since Ortega enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the complaint on to the national congress . There the PLC joined its Sandinista rivals in simply ignoring the charges until the pact was cemented and the leaders of both sides were immunized . Now Narvaez has taken her case to the Interamerican Court of Human Rights , the legal arm of the Organization of American States , suing the Nicaraguan government for denying her access to justice . <p> Ortega refused repeated requests for an interview , but Narvaez agreed to break her self-imposed silence in a conversation at her modest home in Managua . Tall , soft-spoken , and highly articulate , she unleashed a torrent of anguish as her two young children played nearby . " I 'm on a tightrope , because in this election year anything can happen , " she says . " If I speak out , the Liberals can try and use me in some partisan maneuver against Daniel Ortega . But if I am silent , then the Frente will say that I am exonerating him , something I have no intention of doing . " <p> " The greatest error that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleansing themselves of anything and everything that has stained our ideals , " she continues . " I was afraid to start over , but I did . The Sandinistas have to do the same thing . The biggest tragedy is that Daniel has now subjected the entire political strategy of the Frente Sandinista to his personal needs and fears . It has brought him closer than ever to the Somocistas . " <p> And if Ortega is elected president ? " Nothing changes , " she says . " I will pursue the case until the truth is recognized . " <p> Ortega has denied the allegations , and even Narvaez 's most ardent supporters acknowledge that given the power-sharing pact between the Sandinistas and Liberals , her charges are likely to have little effect on the elections . " Ask me about Zoilamerica and I will tell you clearly : I absolutely believe her , " says Dora Maria Tellez , the former Sandinista commander . " But this is a society where incest is common , and no one wants to come to terms with it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The pact did not succeed in eliminating every opposition party . The Conservative Party survived , and is determined to run its own slate in the upcoming elections . That would likely split the anti-Sandinista vote , opening the path to a possible Ortega victory . But few expect his election to make any difference , given the extent of the current economic devastation . " The Sandinistas will have little margin of maneuver if they win , " says former Sandinista General Joaquin Cuadra . " The Sandinistas might be able to manage the crisis , but they ca n't resolve it . " <p> Cuadra and other former Sandinistas , along with dissidents from the right , have been struggling for the past two years to build a " third way " alternative to Ortega and Aleman . " Neither right nor left , but rather democratic and modern , " says Cuadra . The idea had attracted an impressive list of supporters  --  including Manuel Ignacio Lacayo , the wealthy and outspoken businessman known as MIL  --  but the power-sharing pact scuttled efforts to legalize a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse during the campaign . In June , protesters staged hunger strikes in the lobby of the Supreme Electoral Council to denounce its attempts to disqualify third-party candidates . Coffee farmers , shaken by falling prices , threatened to blockade major roads . Bus owners , pressed by soaring gasoline prices , raised fares by almost 50 percent . That , in turn , brought thousands of students into the streets to demand lower fares . Riot police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets . Then bus owners went out on their own strike , forcing many maquiladora employees to get to work aboard ox-drawn carts . <p> " The number of people who have fallen into extreme poverty here is a ticking time bomb , " says Lacayo . " In the days ahead , there is either going to be a whole lot more apathy  --  or a whole lot more anarchy . " <p> Enrique Bolanos ( below ) promises to be " the first democratically elected Contra " if he defeats Daniel Ortega ( bottom ) . <p> Hundreds of people live as scavengers at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Nicaraguans have become addicted to sniffing glue . <p> Businessman Manuel Ignacio Lacayo says the corruption of President Amoldo Aleman has plunged Nicaragua deeper into poverty . <p> It has also created an opening for the Sandinistas , who can still mobilize fervent rallies . <p> Zoilamerica Narvaez Murillo has accused her stepfather , Daniel Ortega , of sexual abuse , including rape . <p> By Marc Cooper <p> Photographs by Pedro Linger Gasiglia <p>
