An innovative approach to video photography allows fireball hunters to scan the sky 24 hours a day . // BY JIM GAMBLE // In the black of the night it just catches the corner of your eye . A rapidly brightening , fast-moving ball of light trailing across the sky . You look skyward with a resounding " whoa ! " as you witness the flight of a spectacular meteoric firework called a " fireball . " Then the inevitable thoughts race through your mind . . . What was that ? Did anybody else see it ? Is there somebody keeping track of these things ? In at least some instances , the answer is yes . The network It 's known as the Sandia Fireball Network , and its purpose is to acquire multiple-camera recordings of bright fireball events . My association with the fireball network began in August 2000 , when , as a television weather forecaster in El Paso , Texas , I pleaded with my audience for eyewitness accounts of an incredible fireball I had observed the night before . I received a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico State University in Las Graces , about 40 miles north of El Paso . Liefeld operates an all-sky camera there and provided me with a video of my fireball . Eureka ! " I want one of these cameras , " I told him . He put me in touch with Dick Spalding , and my El Paso station was up and running by January 2001 . Photograph A-15-MAGNITUDE FIREBALL over southern Colorado was captured ( left ) by a mirror camera located at Sandia National Laboratories near Albuquerque , New Mexico . Despite an intense search of the projected landing area , no meteoric debris has been discovered yet . SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORIES THE SAME METEOR was imaged by another camera right , also at Sandia , with a direct-vision fish-eye lens . Note that the fish-eye lens reverses the image . This is a minor drawback , much outweighed by the benefits of an unobstructed view . SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORIES // The network , which now consists of about twenty relatively low-cost all-sky videocameras , spans five regions in western North America . Initial support for the fireball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New Mexico , as an adjunct to a program funded by the United States Department of Energy . In the adjunct program , satellite-mounted visible-light flash detectors monitor the globe for atmospheric nuclear detonations . These space-based sensors routinely record between thirty and fifty bright fireballs per year . But the high altitudes of these satellites preclude obtaining information precise enough to determine the velocity and trajectory of atmospheric fireballs . One aim of the fireball network is to collect " ground truth " on events to establish where in the solar system larger impactors seen by the satellites may have originated . Photograph A BRILLIANT FIREBALL visible from the southwest of El Paso , Texas , on January 11 , 2003 , was captured on videotape . This event measured - 13.9 in visual magnitude , the brightest event yet seen by the El Paso station of the all-sky Sandia Fireball Network . JIM GAMBLE // How it all began The idea for inexpensive fireball monitoring has its seeds in chance recordings of bright fireballs by security videocameras during the late 1990s . In these cases , the cameras , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fireball 's flight reflected in the windshields and bodies of parked automobiles . Although the irregular shape of these surfaces resulted in distorted images , it was readily apparent to Dick Spalding and George Alder , both of Sandia Labs , that much could be achieved with a simple videocamera and good reflector geometry . By chance , in January 1998 , an unusual outbreak of fireballs occurred over Colorado . Trying to cash in on that activity , Spalding and Alder hastily contrived a simple design employing a hemispherical safety mirror . They assembled and tested a garage-built prototype and began the Sandia Fireball Network . Out of the starting gate The initial all-sky camera design consisted of an 18-inch-diameter convex , acrylic , hemispherical safety mirror , with a black-and-white videocamera mounted above it facing downward . The camera was housed in a short length of 3-inch-diameter PVC pipe , capped at the top to keep rain out , but open at the bottom and supported by four aluminum legs . An early concern was whether the cameras ' optical parts would tolerate the Sun 's reflected image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a problem , making it feasible to do 24-hour unattended operation and not simply nighttime monitoring of the sky . The setup proved to be robust , with both cameras and mirrors able to operate for years with little degradation . Another problem soon cropped up , however . Birds used the camera housing as an outhouse perch , so a cluster of long nails or screws was attached to the top of the housing cap pointing skyward . And this solution works - usually . To support full-time operation , systems are equipped with three videocassette recorders , each programmed to record a specific 8-hour segment of the day . An operator changes all three tapes every 24 hours , and recorded tapes are archived . By April 1998 , the first production camera systems were ready and not a moment too soon . A new center of fireball activity seemed to be developing above the Pacific Northwest . Spalding contacted Jeremy Tatum of the University of Victoria , British Columbia , Canada , whose name had been mentioned in one of the fireball reports , and asked whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Canada for all-sky cameras . By June , three new systems had been deployed , one each at Courtenay , Nanaimo , and Victoria . Today , the network spans the western and southwestern United States as well as southwestern Canada . Of bytes and brains One of the difficulties encountered with the initially deployed systems was finding fireball occurrences on miles of videotape . Camera operators relied on eyewitness reports to know where to locate the fireballs on their tapes . Playing back and searching recorded videotapes was a tedious and mind-numbing task . A few years ago , however , a chance to improve the search process arose . Photograph THIS COMPOSITE IMAGE of the Leonid meteor shower was created at Sandia National Laboratories on the night of November 18/19 , 2003 . More than sixty meteors were recorded that night through the new fish-eye lens installed just prior to the shower . SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORIES THE ALL-SKY FIREBALL NETWORK runs 24 hours a day . This daylight meteor was captured by a direct-viewing camera at Sandia National Laboratories . This event occurred on May 5 , 2002 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NATIONAL LABORATORIES THE JANUARY 11 , 2003 , FIREBALL , which reached magnitude - 13.9 , was captured by a direct-vision camera from Sandia National Laboratories . This fireball , which would have been visible in daylight , was imaged by several fireball network cameras . SANDIA NATIONAL LABORATORIES // Joe Chavez , a Sandia Labs engineer associated with the satellite fireball observations , elected to complement the electrical engineering degree he received from Stanford with a master 's degree in computer science . One step in completing the graduation requirements was to devise a project that applied computer science . Chavez proposed continually digitizing videos from all-sky cameras and examining them for fireball occurrences using a combination of custom-designed hardware and software . The faculty at New Mexico Institute of Technology accepted his proposal , and he then proceeded to design and program the system he dubbed Meteor Sentinel . Chavez 's system was completed in 2001 . Housed in an unassuming aluminum box , Meteor Sentinel has proved effective in recording fireball activity . In addition to automatic event capture , Sentinel includes other features that greatly facilitate both detection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of areas containing nuisance false-alarm activity ; automatic calculation of the center of fireballs encompassing multiple pixels ( called the centroid ) ; for radiometry , the summing of all fireball-related pixel values above a specified threshold for each scan ; and precision time-tagging of video frames ( when an accurate time reference is available ) . Photograph ALL ORIGINAL MIRROR SYSTEMS , such as the one shown here , are being replaced by new , direct-vision fish-eye cameras . Here , a mirror camera is watched over by its nemesis - a bird . The long screws sticking up from the top cap are only partially effective in controlling a bird 's desire to roost ( among other things ) on top of the camera . JIM GAMBLE THE NEW FISH-EYE LENS is attached to the camera and mounted in its Poly Vinyl Chloride ( PVC ) housing . The camera 's power adapter and video cable are inside the PVC tube totally protected from the weather . JIM GAMBLE AN ACRYLIC DOME ( in this case , 10 inches in diameter ) sits on a base that houses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the dome and the base , which are joined by twelve bolts and nuts . JIM GAMBLE // A bright idea For the videocamera systems in place at Sandia Labs , recordings on a separate , custom-built , all-sky radiometer ( brightness meter ) are available . These serve as a check for the accuracy of video-derived fireball magnitudes . Results show magnitude estimates made by researchers from the videotapes are in agreement with the radiometer . Calibration of the camera 's light sensitivity is done by " shuttering " the camera off , then quickly on again during a Full Moon ( which has a known visual magnitude of - 12.7 ) using a piece of cardboard . Meteor Sentinel automatically locks onto the Moon , inputs the raw data into an Excel spreadsheet formula ( also devised by Joe Chavez ) , and graphs the visual magnitude of a meteor event without an actual radiometer . Where 'd it go ? Meteor Sentinel 's ability to calculate a fireball image centroid permits the tracking of the fireball 's location in azimuth and elevation . Whatever the number of pixels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sentinel 's digitizer chip to a 480x640 pixel format . If the entire 480 vertical pixels are used to display the 180 of sky from horizon to horizon , each of those pixels represents 0.375 . This would be about the limit for resolving the fireball 's position if a phenomenon called blooming did not occur . Most fireballs saturate not only the pixel on which their image resides but many adjacent pixels as well ( their image blooms ) , with some light also spilling over into surrounding , non-saturated pixels . Thus , dozens of pixels often have elevated values and are involved in the centroid calculation . The result is that the location of the centroid generally can be determined to about a tenth of a pixel . In principle , this increases the accuracy of the precision of both the azimuth and elevation of a fireball to about 0.04 . This accuracy can be realized , particularly with cameras equipped with newly designed fish-eye lenses . In these systems , just a few precisely measured reference stars suffice to " calibrate " the entire field of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around a while , but we are just beginning to realize the potential of these bug-eyed cameras for meteor detection . For one , they look directly at the sky , horizon to horizon , with no support struts or camera housing to obstruct recording a meteor 's flight . These lenses are protected by an acrylic dome , which is much less susceptible to the " folly of fowl . " When used with cameras employing newer , more sensitive CCD chips , stars brighter than 0 magnitude show up even without " stacking " images . By stacking video frames , whereby numerous frames are combined to make a single image , even fainter stars can be used for calibration of the camera 's field of view . A big benefit of the fish-eye lens is there is virtually no elevation-angle distortion in the image . The lenses also are cheaper now than when the fireball network began . The Rainbow L163VDC4P lens , currently in use at many stations , costs about $150 . Dim and dimmer Spending resources to detect and calculate dim , unspectacular events overhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it also means we can see brighter events occurring farther from the camera . Fireballs recorded at Sandia are now routinely seen by El Paso and Las Cruces cameras 250 miles ( 400 kilometers ) to the south . Plotting dimmer events also serves as calculation and procedural practice . Renowned meteor researchers around the world monitor Sandia fireball network data regularly . And if the past is any indication of the future , the Sandia Fireball Network could well become the preeminent meteor detection , imaging , and research network in the world .

The tube is extended to allow all cabling to be run directly into the house . JIM GAMBLE // " HELLO , IS THIS WHERE I REPORT A BRIGHT STREAK IN THE SKY ? " When the operator of a fireball network camera receives a report of a bright fireball , the first line of investigation is to determine whether it truly was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location can help a fireball network member determine if it was a space rock , space program debris ( a re-entering rocket , etc. ) , an aircraft , or even kids shooting fireworks . More careful analysis provides data such as altitudes and azimuths , length of flight in video frames , and an estimate of magnitude . Event video is then digitized and transferred to computer and forwarded to scientists at Sandia Labs for evaluation and verification . With the new Meteor Sentinel automated software , fireball data can be calculated immediately and to a high degree of accuracy . In addition to elevation , azimuth , and magnitude calculations , a digital movie file and a composite image ( all the movie frames of the flight combined into one image ) are available immediately to the operator . Plotting an event seen by two or more stations can quickly reveal beginning and ending altitudes , speed , angle of descent , and geographical location . All these data greatly aid researchers in locating the landing site in the event that fragments of meteoric origin make their way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meteorologist and a meteor watcher in El Paso , Texas . // <p>
