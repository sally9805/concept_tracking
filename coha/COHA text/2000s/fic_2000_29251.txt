The late morning blazed with blue skies and the colors of fall , but none of it was for me . Sunlight and beauty were for other people now , my life stark and without song . I stared out the window at a neighbor raking leaves and felt helpless , broken and gone . Benton 's words resurrected every awful image I had repressed . I saw beams of light picking out heat-shattered bones in soggy trash and water . Shock rocked me again when confusing shapes turned into a scorched head with no features and clumps of sooty silver hair . I was sitting at my kitchen table sipping hot tea that Senator Frank Lord had brewed for me . I was exhausted and lightheaded from storms of nausea that had sent me fleeing to the bathroom twice . I was humiliated , because beyond all things I feared losing control , and I just had . " I need to rake the leaves again , " I inanely said to my old friend . " December sixth and it 's like October . Look out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you noticed ? Supposedly that means a hard winter , but it does n't even look like we 're going to have winter . I ca n't remember if you have acorns in Washington . " " We do , " he said . " If you can find a tree or two . " " Are they big ? The acorns , I mean . " " I 'll be sure to look , Kay . " I covered my face with my hands and sobbed . He got up from the table and came around to my chair . Senator Lord and I had grown up in Miami and had gone to school in the same archdiocese , although I had attended St. Brendan 's High School only one year and longafter he was there . Yet that somewhat removed crossing of paths was a sign of what would come . When he was the district attorney , I was working for the Dade County Medical Examiner 's Office and often testified in his cases . When he was elected a United States senator and then appointed the chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examiner of Virginia and he began calling on me to lend my voice in his fight against crime . I was stunned when he called me yesterday to say he was coming to see me and had something important to deliver . I barely slept all night . I was devastated when he walked into my kitchen and slipped the simple white envelope out of a pocket of his suit . As I sat with him now , it made perfect sense that Benton would have trusted him this much . He knew Senator Lord cared deeply for me and would never let me down . How typical of Benton to have a plan that would be executed perfectly , even though he was n't around to see it through . How typical of him to predict my behavior after his death and for every word of it to be true . " Kay , " Senator Lord said , standing over me as I wept in my chair , " I know how hard this must be and wish I could make it all go away . I think one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benton I would do this . I never wanted to believe this day would come , but it has and I 'm here for you . " He fell silent , then added , " No one 's ever asked me to do anything like this before , and I 've been asked a lot of things . " " He was n't like other people , " I quietly replied as I willed myself to calm down . " You know that , Frank . Thank God you do . " Senator Lord was a striking man who bore himself with the dignity of his office . He had thick gray hair and intense blue eyes , was tall and lean and dressed , as was typical , in a conservative dark suit accented by a bold , bright tie , cuff links , pocket watch and stickpin . I got up from my chair and took a deep , shaky breath . I snatched several tissues from a box and wiped my face and nose . " You were very kind to come here , " I said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he replied with a sad smile . " You 've done it all by being here . I ca n't imagine the trouble you 've gone to . Your schedule and all . " " I must admit I flew in from Florida , and by the way , I checked on Lucy and she 's doing great things down there , " he said . Lucy , my niece , was an agent for the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms , or ATF . Recently , she had been reassigned to the Miami field office , and I had n't seen her for months . " Does she know about the letter ? " I asked Senator Lord . " No , " he answered , looking out the window at a perfect day . " I think that 's your call to make . And she 's feeling rather neglected by you , I might add . " " By me ? " I said , surprised . " She 's the one who ca n't be reached . At least I 'm not undercover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She ca n't even talk to me unless she 's at headquarters or on a pay phone . " " You 're not easy to find , either . You 've been elsewhere in your spirit since Benton died . Missing in action , and I do n't even think you realize it , " he said . " I know . I 've tried to reach out to you , too , have n't I ? " Tears flooded my eyes again . " And if I get hold of you , what do you tell me ? Everything 's fine . Just busy . Not to mention , you have n't come to see me once . Now and then in the old days , you even brought me some of your special soups . You have n't been taking care of those who love you . You have n't been taking care of yourself . " He had covertly glanced up at the clock several times now . I got up from my chair . " Are you heading back to Florida ? " I asked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " I 'm on Face the Nation again . More of the same . I 'm so disgusted by it all , Kay . " " I wish I could do something to help you , " I said to him . " It 's dirty out there , Kay . If certain people knew I was here alone in your house with you , they 'd start some vicious rumor about me . I 'm sure of it . " " I wish you had n't come here , then . " " Nothing would have stopped me . And I should n't be railing on about Washington . You have enough to deal with . " " I 'll vouch for your sterling character anytime , " I said . " It would n't do any good , if it came to that . " I walked him through the impeccable house I had designed , past fine furniture and art and the antique medical instruments I collected , and over bright rugs and hardwood floors . Everything was precisely to my taste but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was here . I paid no more attention to my home than I did to myself these days . I had become a heartless custodian of my life , and it was evident everywhere I looked . Senator Lord noticed my briefcase open on the great room couch , and case files , mail and memos spilled over the glass coffee table , and legal pads on the floor . Cushions were askew , an ashtray dirty because I 'd started smoking again . He did n't lecture me . " Kay , do you understand I 've got to have limited contact with you after this ? " Senator Lord said . " Because of what I just alluded to . " " God , look at this place , " I blurted out in disgust . " I just ca n't seem to keep up anymore . " " There 've been rumors , " he cautiously went on . " I wo n't go into them . There have been veiled threats . " Anger heated his voice . " Just because we 're friends . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heartbroken laugh . " Benton and I were always squabbling about my house , my shit . My perfectly appointed , perfectly arranged shit . " My voice rose as grief and fury flared up higher than before . " If he rearranged or put something in the wrong drawer ... That 's what happens when you hit middle age and have lived alone and had everything your own goddamn way . " " Kay , are you listening to me ? I do n't want you to feel I do n't care if I do n't call you very much , if I do n't invite you up for lunch or to get your advice about some bill I 'm trying to pass . " " Right now I ca n't even remember when Tony and I got divorced , " I bitterly said . " What ? Nineteen eighty-three ? He left . So what ? I did n't need him or anyone else who followed . I could make my world the way I wanted it , and I did . My career , my possessions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the foyer and swept my hand over my beautiful stone house and all that was in it . " So what ? So fucking what ? " I looked Senator Lord in the eye . " Benton could dump garbage in the middle of this fucking house ! He could tear the goddamn place down ! I just wish none of it had ever mattered , Frank . " I wiped away furious tears . " I wish I could do it over and never criticize him once about anything . I just want him here . Oh , God , I want him here . Every morning I wake up not remembering , and then it hits again and I can barely get out of bed . " Tears ran down my face . It seemed every nerve in my body had gone haywire . " You made Benton very happy , " Senator Lord said gently and with feeling . " You meant everything to him . He told me how good you were to him , how much you understood the hardships of his life , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those atrocious cases for the FBI . Deep down , I know you know that . " I took a deep breath and leaned against the door . " And I know he would want you to be happy now , to have a better life . If you do n't , then the end result of loving Benton Wesley will prove damaging and wrong , something that ruined your life . Ultimately , a mistake . Does that make sense ? " " Yes , " I said . " Of course . I know exactly what he would want right now . I know what I want . I do n't want it like this . This is almost more than I can bear . At times I 've thought I would snap , just fall apart and end up on a ward somewhere . Or maybe in my own damn morgue . " " Well , you wo n't . " He took my hand in both of his . " If there 's anything I know about you , it 's that you will prevail against all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your journey happens to be the hardest , but there 's a better road ahead . I promise , Kay . " I hugged him hard . " Thank you , " I whispered . " Thank you for doing this , for not leaving it in some file somewhere , not remembering , not bothering . " " Now , you 'll call me if you need me ? " he pretty much ordered , as I opened the front door . " But you 'll keep in mind what I said and promise you wo n't feel ignored . " " I understand . " " I 'm always there if you need me . Do n't forget that . My office always knows where I am . " I watched the black Lincoln drive off , then went into my great room and built a fire , although it was n't cold enough to need one . I was desperate for something warm and alive to fill the emptiness left by Senator Lord 's leaving . I read Benton 's letter again and again and heard his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , veins prominent in strong forearms , his firm , elegant hands holding the silver Mont Blanc fountain pen I had given him for no special reason other than that it was precise and pure like him . Tears would not stop , and I held up the page with his engraved initials so his writing would not smear . His penmanship and the way he expressed himself had always been deliberate and spare , and I found his words a comfort and a torment as I obsessively studied them , dissecting , excavating for one more hint of meaning or tone . At intervals , I almost believed he was cryptically telling me his death was n't real , was part of an intrigue , a plan , something orchestrated by the FBI , the CIA , God only knew . Then the truth returned , bringing its hollow chill to my heart . Benton had been tortured and murdered . DNA , dental charts , personal effects had verified that the unrecognizable remains were his . I tried to imagine how I would honor his request tonight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of Lucy 's flying to Richmond , Virginia , for dinner . I picked up the phone and tried to reach her anyway , because that was what Benton had asked me to do . She called me back on her portable phone about fifteen minutes later . " The office said you 're looking for me . What 's going on ? " she said cheerfully . " It 's hard to explain , " I began . " I wish I did n't always have to go through your field office to get to you . " " Me , too . " " And I know I ca n't say much ... " I started to get upset again . " What 's wrong ? " She cut in . " Benton wrote a letter ... " " We 'll talk another time . " She interrupted again , and I understood , or at least I assumed I did . Cell phones were not secure . " Turn in right there , " Lucy said to someone . " I 'm sorry , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pit stop at Los Bobos to get a shot of colada . " " A what ? " " High-test caffeine and sugar in a shot glass . " " Well , it 's something he wanted me to read now , on this day . He wanted you ... Never mind . It all seems so silly . " I fought to sound as if I were held together just fine . " Got ta go , " Lucy said to me . " Maybe you can call later ? " " Will do , " she said in her same irritating tone . " Who are you with ? " I prolonged the conversation because I needed her voice , and I did n't want to hang up with the echo of her sudden coolness in my ear . " My psycho partner , " she said . " Tell her hi . " " She says hi , " Lucy said to her partner , Jo , who was Drug Enforcement Agency , or DEA . They worked together on a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of very vicious home invasions . Jo and Lucy 's relationship was a partnership in another way , too , but they were very discreet . I was n't sure AFT or DEA even knew . " Later , " Lucy said to me , and the line went dead .
