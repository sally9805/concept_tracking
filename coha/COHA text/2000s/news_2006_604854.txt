<p> Emma Johnson is 13 . <p> Every Tuesday night you can find her with her sister , Lydia , 8 , in the same spot : plopped down on the living room couch at their home in Vero Beach , Fla. , glued to American Idol . <p> " I have been watching American Idol since the first season , and I have loved it ever since , " she says . <p> That staying power is what has amazed the television industry about American Idol . Most shows are fortunate to make it to a fifth season , and some are lucky to see even a fifth episode . <p> But Idol is not only a ratings powerhouse , it 's stronger than ever : <p> *The Tuesday night premiere Jan. 15 was the highest-rated entertainment show in Fox 's history , with 35.5 million viewers , according to Nielsen Media Research . <p> *The show is averaging nearly 34 million viewers on Tuesdays and 31 million on Wednesdays this season , an increase of more than 3million viewers over last season . <p> *Last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about music , by more than 10 million viewers . <p> The big question now : Will the Fox talent show beat the Olympics , which are running on NBC every day until Feb. 26 and typically dominate the ratings ? They go head-to-head for the first time tonight ( 8 ET/PT ) . <p> " I think American Idol stands the best chance of anyone to topple the Olympics , " says Brad Adgate of Horizon Media , who notes that his daughter , Abigail , 13 , is hooked on Idol . <p> Typically , the Winter Games ' strength is with older women , whereas Idol is popular with everybody  --  men , women , young and old  --  and with a particular emphasis on young women . <p> And from a practical standpoint , Idol will go head-to-head with the Olympics five times over two weeks but only for an hour or two , making it easy to skip the sports in favor of the singing . <p> Still , Adgate says , " I think NBC will win the February sweeps , " a ratings period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it depends on a lot of ingredients that you ca n't even guess with sports : the events , how well Americans are doing and other things . " <p> Idol 's ability to increase its viewership while maintaining the same formula over the years " defies conventional wisdom , " he says . <p> Conventional network programming theory would say to run it year-round , cashing in on the success . But Fox airs only one Idol contest a year . <p> " It 's supply and demand , " Adgate says , " and they limit the supply of the show . When it starts again , there 's a huge demand . " <p> Demand that big means viewers of all ages are watching . It 's consistently a top 10 show among all age groups , and it 's also a top 10 show among the advertiser-coveted 18-49 group . <p> But most notably this season , teen girls are really into Idol worship . Of the 166 six-network programs so far this season , Idol draws 135% more teens than any other show and 134% more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 , of Rexburg , Idaho , knows exactly what she 'll be watching this week . " It 's sort of easy to answer that because I do n't watch the Olympics usually , so American Idol , of course . " <p> Says Sami Morley , 15 , of St. Louis : " I kept watching it after the first season because I love Kelly Clarkson . And then I also love to watch the top 12 battle it out . I like to watch all of their performances , and I like to see how all of the judges react , especially Simon . " <p> There are ways to find out whether your daughter is an Idol addict , although you probably already know . <p> Posted on the message board at idolonfox.com is the list " You Know You 're Addicted to American Idol When ... " There are 35 different endings , clearly written by , or geared toward , kids . <p> For example : " You begin to doze off in history class and only snap back to attention when the teacher uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or " You claim your favorite movie is the 1997 cheesy TV horror movie Touched by Evil , starring Paula Abdul as a woman attacked by a serial rapist . " <p> Or maybe you know you 're an addict when you hear a song and immediately think how perfect it would be for an Idol to sing it . <p> " To me , the best part of the show is all the singers , " says Kelly Richardson , 16 , of Fort Wayne , Ind . " I like to watch them as they try out and see if I can pick the one that 's going to make it all the way . " <p> That 's one way the show connects with viewers , especially women , executive producer Ken Warwick says . <p> " It 's something that does seem to affect females more than guys . Guys will look at it and go , ' What an idiot . Look at him . Go get a life . ' But the girls become involved in the kind of hopes and dreams of the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are terrible . " <p> The show and those stories make it water-cooler cool . <p> " When they go to school the next day , it 's become the show to watch , and if they have n't seen it , they 've got a problem , " Warwick says . <p> Something for everyone <p> To create buzz , there has to be something to buzz about . Matthew Robinson , author of How to Get on Reality TV ( Random House ) , says Idol casting directors look for three things in contestants to ensure the show 's popularity . " It 's called the holy trinity of American Idol casting : good voice , a good look and a good story . <p> " This season , it seems to be in reverse order : a good story , a good look and a good voice . The back story is so important . There are a million amazing voices in this country . An amazing voice is n't going to get you on the show . " <p> The emotional drama is what hooks viewers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing cowboy Garrett Johnson , who had never left home and was easily brought to tears , Robinson says . " Not a very good voice , not a very good look , but a great story . They 've figured out exactly what works and they 've got it down to a science . " <p> Gayle Arnum of Forest Hills , N.Y. , and her daughter , Drew , 7 , watch together . " Last season Drew was in love with Constantine ( Maroulis ) , as were many girls of all ages , and actually cried when he got voted off , " Arnum says . <p> " There are n't many shows appropriate for a young girl that are n't cartoons or repeats of old shows on Nick . Once the voting starts , we will definitely participate in that process , as we did last year . It 's fun for the whole family . " <p> Or for anyone , it seems . " At the beginning of the season , it 's the best comedy on television . Near the end , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 , a record company executive in Woodland Hills , Calif . <p> " As a 30-year-old banker , it is a guilty pleasure , " says Michael Manginello of New Milford , N.J. " I started watching the show back when it debuted in 2002 . I was working in the promotions department for ( radio station ) Z100 in New York City , and everyone was talking about it . I actually built a shrine to Justin Guarini there . It swept through the office like the common cold . " <p> What does he love most ? " The ' real ' factor , " he says . <p> The audition segments that kick the show off , featuring odd characters as well as talented singers , are a big draw . " I was channel surfing , could n't find anything to watch and a particularly horrific audition caught my eye , " says Tracy LeGrand , 39 , of Tulsa . <p> Suddenly , she was hooked . <p> " It 's a spectacle . It 's human . It 's fascinating , " LeGrand says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Flashes of brilliance <p> Let 's not forget that it is a talent show . That 's why Greg Palmer , 50 , a university professor and father of three , tunes in . <p> " There are a whole lot of people getting recording contracts and making money who do n't have the talent to back up the fame . When the occasional flash of brilliance comes along  --  Kimberley Locke , LaToya London  --  I want to get behind that talent , " Palmer says . <p> And there is still plenty of talent in the pool . <p> " This show is in 36 countries now , " Warwick says , " and , generally speaking , you find after about the third or fourth series that the talent pool starts to buckle down a little bit . Some countries , like Germany for instance , have said , ' Well , OK , let 's give it a year 's rest , ' and they deliberately cut you off the air for a year and then revisit it two years later , and it 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried that the talent would n't be so great . <p> " I could n't have been proven more wrong . The talent this year is fabulous . And there are kids who are being tossed out of Hollywood who would have been in the top five any other year . So you 'll just have to leave it up to America to decide who it 's going to be .
