How intelligent devices are changing life for a congressman , a medical student , a policeman , and a lawyer . Nancy Abell , a high-priced litigator who defends corporations against big-dollar class-action suits , carries the usual armaments of battle into a courtroom . If she 's involved in a minor skirmish-an evidentiary hearing , say-Abell heads into court clutching a brown leather briefcase bulging with briefs . When engaged in the drawn-out cross fire of a trial , she hauls out the heavy artillery , what she describes as her " briefcase on wheels . " But it 's in her . purse that Abell carries the sleek black electronic device she thinks of as her secret weapon . Consider a day earlier this year , when a judge in a Los Angeles courtroom changed the field of engagement on Abell , announcing that he was reassigning her case to a colleague . The stakes were enormous : Abell 's client was a sizable multinational that stood to lose millions if she lost . California law permits one preemptory challenge without cause , but Abell-who chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a firm with roughly 800 lawyers-knew little about the new judge . Should she accept the reassignment , as her rival litigator had done without hesitation ( which itself was enough to stir suspicion ) , or object ? The presiding judge obliged when she asked to consult with her client but gave her only a few minutes to decide , because the new judge was waiting in his courtroom . In the old days-which is to say , until about a year ago-Abell would have rushed to call her office , frantically searching for anyone who might know something about the new judge . Instead , she walked to a marble bench in the corridor , reached into her purse , and removed a gizmo called a BlackBerry . The device , roughly the size of a deck of cards , lets Abell send and receive electronic messages from almost anywhere she might be . She tapped out a message that she batch-sent to every L.A.-based litigator in her firm : " I 've been assigned to Judge X. Please provide any input . " She then walked over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courthouse ) , where she phoned her client . " As I 'm phoning , I 'm starting to get responses from people in my firm , " Abell recalls . An associate had sent her the judge 's biography , cut-and-pasted from the court 's Website . She heard from lawyers back at the office as well as several who were on the road but carrying a Black Berry . In all , Abell heard from about a dozen people . " In the past , I would n't have had the time to confer with all these people , nor would I have known how to find them , " she says . " Yet I was able to quickly share with my client the personal experience of many of my colleagues . " Based on the feedback , Abell advised her client to accept the new judge . " In a day-to-day way , my BlackBerry makes a difference in how I go about my job , " she says . Abell is emblematic of a far broader trend : people in non-technical professions employing electronic gadgetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transforming the way they work . On that fateful election night in November 2000 , when Al Gore famously decided to return to his campaign headquarters rather than deliver a concession speech , what changed his mind was the message sent to him by a top advisor-via his BlackBerry-stating that Florida was suddenly too close to call . In August , the Washington , D.C. , Metropolitan Police Department began outfitting police cruisers with cameras that catch drivers going at least ten miles an hour above posted speed limits . The machines snap photographs of the offending cars , including license-plate close-ups , which are included on the traffic ticket the city sends to the vehicle 's registered owner . Last year , the D.C. police wrote just over 10,000 speeding tickets . But according to Lt. Patrick Burke , the officer coordinating the District 's traffic program , the device ( which he 's indined to call " the future of speed enforcement " ) will help his department issue roughly 500,000 speeding tickets over the next 12 months . // " Since we 've gone live , I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology , " Burke says . Their main concern ? " They want to see how we do with the media in terms of acceptance , " he says . Members of Congress have been slow to adopt intelligent devices , but most who do find them invaluable . In the immediate aftermath of the assaults on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center , Rep. Fred Upton , R-Mich. , found that his BlackBerry was his only way to communicate . Says Upton spokesman Mike Waldron , " When the Capitol was evacuated because of the plane that flew into the Pentagon , Fred and I were at a press conference in the Senate . No cell phones were working in Washington , and we could n't get into the building to get a land line . The only way to coordinate with the rest of the staff was with our BlackBerries . " Use of smart devices continues to increase , despite the hard times afflicting so many technology companies . To show how the devices are altering the workplace , we 've spotlighted four individuals on the tech-toting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wears the " geek " label almost as proudly as he wears the moniker " free-market conservative " ; Kendra Bergstrom , a medical student at the Stanford Medical Center , in the heart of Silicon Valley ; Lt. Patrick Burke , who spends part of each day searching out new high-tech toys aimed at cracking down on speeders , underage drinkers , and other miscreants ; and Nancy Abell , whose law firm was recently honored by CIO magazine for its cutting-edge use of technology . Rep. Dick Armey House Majority Leader Washington , D.C. , is not a city that takes easily to change . Cell phones are ubiquitous , of course , but in the Capitol one still sees congressional pages delivering handwritten notes to members on the floors of the House and Senate . It was only in the early 1990s that the local police force replaced its rotary phones with touch-tone devices . Senators still rely solely on the voice vote , eschewing the newfangled ways of their more plebian colleagues in the House of Representatives , where votes are recorded electronically . Rep. Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far deep down on the dark side of the digital divide . " The strangest part , he says , is that a great many are proud of their lack of technical savvy . That certainly does not describe Armey . " The Congressman is into his toys , " a young staff assistant named Kendall says of Armey as he escorts a journalist to the boss 's office , right off the Capitol Rotunda . Earlier that week , a knot of the Majority Leader 's staffers had been gathered around a television to watch a press briefing . " Someone else was talking at the time , but we could see Mr. Armey off in the background staring down at something in his hands . We all started laughing because we knew exactly what he was doing , " Kendall says . Armey was staring down at a BlackBerry , reading his E-mail . " I try and be careful about that " for the sake of good manners , Armey says . But sometimes he just ca n't help himself . Armey is large man with a jowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey-baked Texas accent . He appears well-tanned after the long summer recess and is in fine spirits , playful and droll . He sits at a round wooden table to the right of his desk with nothing but the essentials laid out before him : an ashtray , matches , a pack of Carltons , and the sleek black device he jokingly refers to as his " Raspberry , " which he 's been using since the start of the year . " I pull out my Raspberry and I 've got a high-tech , computerized , wireless , satellite communication device . Now I 'm like , Beam me up , Scotty , " ' Armey says . Armey 's true passion is music over the Internet . He 's forever digitally splicing together famous voices with favorite songs and sending them out as E-mail attachments , to the amusement of friends and congressional colleagues-most of whom he believes must impose on staff to open the file before they can listen to it . At times his fiddling with MP3s represents more than idle fun . Life as Majority Leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues by preventing a bill from reaching the House floor . On one such occasion , when a fellow Republican was " riled-up mad at me , " he says , he sent his colleague an M file . The song , " Faster Horses " by Tom T. Hall , " seemed to fit my colleague 's physical characteristics , " Armey explains , and its tone " helped to demonstrate that we-or I-can take ourselves too seriously . " Apparently , Armey chose well : " Instead of snarling at me the next day , he was chuckling about the song I had sent him . " Photograph Rep.

" Anything new he just marveled over . He had to have it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I got ta have it . " Necessity is another motivation . " Piddling around with these technologies on my own helps me understand what I 'm talking about , " he says . His comfort around new technologies proved useful in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center . " During the first couple of hours after we evacuated the Capitol , cell phones were almost useless . I kept in touch with my staff on my BlackBerry , " Armey says . He stayed abreast of the latest news by logging on to an online wire service and , at a time when an outside line was hard to come by , was also able to send E-mails to his family to put them at ease . " The Congressman was able to let them know he was safe and in the care of the Capitol police , " says Armey staffer Richard Diamond . Kendra Bergstrom Medcial Student It 's 5 a.m. at the Stanford Medical Center , and 26-year-old Kendra Bergstrom , a third-year med student , is preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager , wide-eyed approach to her job , Bergstrom wears a white smock over her blue surgical scrubs . Stuffed into the smock 's right pocket is a stethoscope . A holstered Palm Vx Organizer is clipped to the left pocket , which also carries a slim cell phone . In a breast pocket Bergstrom carries a tin of breath mints and that most low-tech of instruments , a pen . Clipped to the waistband of her scrubs is a hospital pager , but she seems unimpressed with this high-tech relic that , from her youthful perspective , " has been around since the beginning of time . " The pager may be old hat , but PDAs are only starting to gain acceptance in the repertoire of devices at the disposal of hospital personnel . Bergstrom was among the skeptics when Stanford issued Palms to 240 medical students last fall , as part of a pilot program initiated at the suggestion of one of Bergstrom 's colleagues , Shannon Moffett . Now Bergstrom is a believer . The device proved useful when she was studying for the medical boards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise idle moments , such as when standing in line at the grocery store . But her PDA is proving more valuable still now that she 's responsible for tracking the progress of hospital patients . At a little after 5 a.m. , Bergstrom knocks gently on the door of a 40-year-old Asian woman who recently had a section of her liver removed . The patient squints in the glare of an overhead fluorescent light as Bergstrom checks her vital signs , then logs the numbers into her handheld , barely taxing the device , which can store virtual textbooks of information . This patient , for instance , ingests a complex stew of medicines , 15 in all . Every drug has its side effects ; each has the potential to react violently to another . A nifty program on her PDA , provided by a firm called ePocrates , warns Bergstrom when one pharmaceutical might have an adverse effect if mixed with another . " There are vast amounts of information about pharmaceuticals that people need to absorb , and it 's information that 's constantly changing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the PDA pilot program . " People 's understanding of disease is changing all the time , and drug protocols change with it . On top of that , we 're adding several hundred drugs a year . They all have side effects , as well as different adverse reactions and cross-reactions with other drugs . " In the past , you 'd see med students and residents walking around the hospital weighed down by pocket-size reference books that did n't necessarily have the best or most current information . " The amazing thing about the Palm is that it allows you to retrieve information at the point of care , " Gardner says . Bergstrom also uses her Palm to store lab tests . Software on the device allows her to plot trends based on a patient 's daily vitals . Moreover , computers stationed around the hospital give med students and other professionals free access to a Website called Skolar ( developed on Stanford 's campus ) , which aggregates all kinds of medical databases . " This is n't like going to the Web and searching a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is peer-reviewed , constantly updated information that links a physician to full-text journal articles and up-to-date treatment recommendations . It 's absolutely the best available information . " Although technology is woven more deeply than ever into the daily routine at Stanford Medical Center , the digital revolution has n't exactly triumphed here . Bergstrom figures that only half the residents and interns carry a PDA-and even they do n't necessarily take full advantage . When rounds begin at 5:45 on this overcast September morning , the most important instrument anyone carries turns out to be a pen . The med students , including Bergstrom , do n't click on their Palms when reciting a patient 's vital signs , relying instead on the scrawls handwritten on an individual 's chart . Dr. Yale Popowich , who 's running the morning rounds , uses a pen and folded-up piece of paper to jot down information while leaning against any available surface . One of the surgical interns pushes a device new to the hospital , nicknamed " R-2 . " It 's a laptop PC that sits atop a cart-but its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grousing . Notes on care are entered into the device , though the doctor tapping in the information confesses that for now the nurses rely not on R-2 but on the notes written in patients ' charts . Lt. Patrick Burke Police Officer Lt. Patrick Burke has a odd sense of humor . On Friday and Saturday nights , he frequently assembles teams of cops to crack down on a long list of scofflaws , from underage drinkers to drivers going in excess of 30 miles above the speed limit . On a Friday night in early September , he targeted those frequenting one of several large dance clubs near the Capitol , on the city 's southwest side . When asked if he would be willing to show off some of the department 's more-modern gadgetry , he welcomed the chance but advised a reporter to put off showing up until at least midnight . " That 's when the action starts , " Burke says . " That 's when we 'll start locking people up and having some fun . " Burke is an earnest-looking 35-yearold with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his most animated when talking about the future of police work in an increasingly tech-hungry world . He carries a Nextel cellular bolstered on one hip and a 9-mm semiautomatic on the other . His office , on the fourth floor of police headquarters , is jammed with stacks of shiny new toys packaged in cardboard boxes . In one corner are laser speed guns , which are slowly replacing the radar guns that have been a staple of police forces for years . The lasers are far easier to use than radar guns , Burke says , and more reliable . Stacked next to his desk are cartons of " sniffer " flashlights that can detect the scent of alcohol . " These are like an extension of your nose , " he says . " You use them instead of sticking your big fat ugly face into a car . They give us an extra tool to see if we should ask someone to step out of a car and submit to a field sobriety check . " Photograph Lt.

" So if I 'm chasing a car that 's driving recklessly , I can get that on tape , " he says . " Or if I stop someone for impaired driving , I can show them falling down during a sobriety test . " Not incidentally , the video cameras also protect citizens . In fact , Burke says , the Justice Department has ordered select departments to install video cameras in all their patrol cars because of documented cases of racial profiling and the mistreatment of minority suspects . Burke is jazzed by another new toy , the latest tool in the battle against underage drinking : the Intelli-Check IDC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me how easy it is to get a fake ID-a really great fake ID  --  over the Internet , " he says . " For between $50 and $200 , a kid can get a license that looks real to the naked eye and would fool any bouncer . " But it wo n't fool the IDC 1400/1 , a fax-sized black machine with a swipe reader . Most states now issue driver 's licenses that include a credit card-like bar code on the back that can be linked to a DMV database . " If an ID is a fake , the machine will let you know , " Burke says . " Already we 've made hundreds and hundreds of arrests using this machine . As far as we 're concerned , this is just the start . " Nancy Abell Lawyer Life as a litigator means a life on the run , which explains why Nancy Abell can sometimes sound like an amateur efficiency expert . An airplane lands , and she 's stuck in a row near the back . Pulling out a stack of papers or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it 's easy to use her BlackBerry . She can go through as many as 40 E-mails by the time it 's her turn to queue up . " It used to be that I 'd take a break from a deposition at lunch , dial my voice mail , and learn I had 27 messages , " Abell says . " Now our clients use E-mail more , because they know we have BlackBerries . If a witness is reading over a document during a deposition , or something like that , I can be scanning my E-mail . " That 's given rise to a new protocol among her clients and colleagues : If a matter is pressing , they know to type " 911 " in the subject line . " Clients expect great service , and that means as much connectivity as possible , " Abell says . Abell appreciates the value of other technological advances that help her stay on top of her job . For instance , she uses a software program called the JFS Litigator 's Notebook , which helps her keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typically part of the massive class-action suits in which she specializes . In the old days , looking for a memo meant sending a file clerk to sift through endless boxes of documents . Technology allows all those documents to be scanned and stored . " No matter where I am-in a hotel room , at a client 's office , at home , in my office-I can instantly retrieve any piece of paper in the case , " Abell says . Yet while she depends on her Litigator 's Notebook , it 's the BlackBerry that 's the object of her affection-and not just because that 's often the only way her husband knows how to track her down ( " Where R U ? " he 'll write ) . A few months back , the BlackBerry played a supporting role in a settlement conference . Running an idea by a client mid-negotiation typically means slipping a note across the table , but " on this occasion I had a client who also had a wireless device , so while we were sitting at the negotiating table , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of X , let 's suggest such-and-such . ' And the client responded with , Yeah , let 's go with that . ' So there was no break in the flow of the negotiations , " Abell says . Wireless devices such as the BlackBerry do stir up all sorts of etiquette issues . Is it rude to check your E-mail in the middle of a deposition , or-with the BlackBerry on your lap and hidden by the defense table-to surreptitiously type out a message during a judicial hearing , as Abell did recently ? " The thing about the BlackBerry is , it lets you do two things at once , " she says . " Wherever I 'm going , I 'm glancing at it . I 've been glancing at it while doing this interview . In fact , I 've already responded to several messages while we were talking . " Footnote For additional information see www.fortune.cnet.com // <p>
