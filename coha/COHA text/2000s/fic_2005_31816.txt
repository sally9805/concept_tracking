Chapter One Imprimus , they nuked the spaceport . The one-kiloton kinetic energy weapon was a chunk of iron the size of a small aircar . He watched it burn on the viewscreens of the captured Saint special operations ship as it entered the upper atmosphere of the planet Marduk and tracked in perfectly . It exploded in a flash of light and plasma , and the mushroom cloud reached up into the atmosphere , spreading a cloud of dust over the nearer Krath villages . The spaceport was deserted at the moment it turned into plasma . Everything movable , which had turned out to be everything but the buildings and fixed installations , had been stripped from it . The Class One manufacturing facility , capable of making clothes and tools and small weapons , had been secreted at Voitan , along with most of the untrustworthy humans , including all of the surviving Saint Greenpeace commandos who had been captured with the ship . They could work in the Voitan mines , help rebuild the city , or , if they liked nature so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Marduk , teeming with carnivores who would be more than happy to ingest them . Prince Roger Ramius Sergei Alexander Chiang MacClintock watched the explosion with a stony face , then turned to the small group gathered in the ship 's control room , and nodded . " Okay , let 's go . " The prince was a shade under two meters tall , slim but muscular , with some of the compact strength usually associated with professional zero-G ball players . His long blond hair , pulled back in a ponytail , was almost white from sun bleaching , and his handsome , almost beautiful , classic European face was heavily tanned . It was also lined and hard , seeming far older than his twenty-two standard years . He had neither laughed nor smiled in two weeks , and as his long , mobile hand scratched at the neck of the two-meter black and red lizard standing pony-high by his side , Prince Roger 's jade-green eyes were harder than his face . There were many reasons for the lines , for the early aging , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger , behind his back , or simply The Prince-had not been so lined and hard nine months before . When he , his chief of staff and valet , and a company of Marine bodyguards had been hustled out of Imperial City , thrust into a battered old assault ship , and sent packing on a totally nonessential political mission , he had taken its as just another sign of his mother 's disapproval of her youngest son . He 'd shown none of the diplomatic and bureaucratic expertise of his older brother , Prince John , the Heir Primus , nor of the military ability of his older sister the admiral , Princess Alexandra , Heir Secondary . Unlike them , Roger spent his time playing zero-G ball , hunting big game , and generally being the playboy , and he 'd assumed that Mother had simply decided it was time for him to steady down and begin doing the Heir Tertiary 's job . What he had n't known at the time , had n't known until months later , was that he was being hustled out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten wind , somehow , that the internal enemies of House MacClintock were preparing to move . He knew that now . What he still did n't know was whether she 'd wanted him out of the way to protect him ... or to keep the child whose loyalty she distrusted out of both the battle and temptation 's way . What he did know was that the cabal behind the crisis his mother had foreseen had planned long and carefully for it . The sabotage of Charles DeGlopper , his transport , had been but the first step , although neither he nor any of the people responsible for keeping him alive had realized it at the time . What Roger had realized was that the entire crew of the DeGlopper had sacrificed their lives in hopeless battle against the Saint sublight cruisers they had discovered in the Marduk System when the crippled ship finally managed to limp into it . They 'd taken those ships on , rather than even considering surrender , solely to cover Roger 's own escape in DeGlopper 's assault shuttles , and they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect him regarded him with the same contempt as everyone else at Court , nor had DeGlopper 's crew had any reason to regard him differently . Yet they 'd died to protect him . They 'd given up their lives in exchange for his , and they would not be the last to do it . As the men and women of Bravo Company , Bronze Battalion , The Empress ' Own , had marched and fought their way across the planet they 'd reached against such overwhelming odds , the young prince had seen far too many of them die . And as they died , the young fop learned , in the hardest possible school , to defend not simply himself , but the soldiers around him . Soldiers who had become more than guards , more than family , more than brothers and sisters . In the eight brutal months it had taken to cross the planet , making alliances , fighting battles , and at last , capturing the spaceport and the ship aboard which he stood at this very moment , that young fop had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A diplomat trained in a school where diplomacy and a bead pistol worked hand-in-hand . A leader who could command from the rear , or fight in the line , and keep his head when all about him was chaos . But that transformation had not come cheaply . It had cost the lives of over ninety percent of Bravo Company . It had cost the life of Kostas Matsugae , his valet and the only person who had ever seemed to give a single good goddamn for Roger MacClintock . Not Prince Roger . Not the Heir Tertiary to the Throne of Man . Just Roger MacClintock . And it had cost the life of Bravo Company 's commanding officer , Captain Armand Pahner . Pahner had treated his nominal commander first as a useless appendage to be protected , then as a decent junior officer , and , finally , as a warrior scion of House MacClintock . As a young man worthy to be Emperor , and to command Bronze Battalion . Pahner had become more than a friend . He 'd become the father Roger had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And in the end , Pahner had saved the mission and Roger 's life by giving his own . Roger MacClintock could n't remember the names of all his dead . At first , they 'd been faceless nonentities . Too many had been killed taking and holding Voitan , dying under the spears of the Kranolta , before he even learned their names . Too many had been killed by the atul , the low-slung hunting lizards of Marduk . Too many had been killed by the flar-ke , the wild dinosauroids related to the elephant-like flar-ta packbeasts . By vampire moths and their poisonous larva , the killerpillars . By the nomadic Boman , by sea monsters out of darkest nightmares , and by the swords and spears of the cannibalistic " civilized " Krath . But if he could n't remember all of them , he remembered many . The young plasma gunner , Nassina Bosum , killed by her own malfunctioning rifle in one of the first attacks . Corpora Ima Hooker and Dokkum , the happy mountaineer from Sherpa , killed by flar-ke almost within sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 'd ever cared for him in those cold , old days before this nightmare , killed by an accursed damncroc while fetching water for his prince . Gronningen , the massive cannoneer , killed taking the bridge of this very ship . So many dead , and so far yet to go . The Saint ship for which they 'd fought so hard showed how brutal the struggle to capture it had been . No one had suspected that the innocent tramp freighter was a covert , special operations ship , crewed by elite Saint commandos . The risk in capturing it had seemed minor , but since losing Roger would have made their entire epic march and all of their sacrifices in vain , he 'd been left behind with their half-trained Mardukan allies when the surviving members of Bravo Company went up to take possession of the " freighter . " The three-meter-tall , horned , four-armed , mucus-skinned natives of The Basik 's Own had come from every conceivable preindustrial level of technology . D'Nal Cord , his asi-technically , his " slave , " since Roger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though anyone who made the mistake of treating the old shaman as a menial would never live long enough to recognize the enormity of his mistake-and Cord 's nephew Denat had come from the X'Intai , the first , literally Stone Age tribe they had encountered . The Vasin , riders of the fierce , carnivorous civan , were former feudal lords whose city-state had been utterly destroyed by the rampaging Boman barbarians and who had provided The Basik 's Own 's cavalry . The core of its infantry had come from the city of Diaspra-worshipers of the God of Waters , builders and laborers who had been trained into a disciplined force first of pikemen , and then of riflemen . The Basik 's Own had followed Roger through the battles that destroyed the " invincible " Boman , then across demon-haunted waters to totally unknown lands . Under the banner of a basik , rampant , long teeth bared in a vicious grin , they 'd battled the Krath cannibals and taken the spaceport . And in the end , when the Marines were unable to overcome the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been hurled into the fray again . Rearmed with modern weaponry-hypervelocity bead and plasma cannon normally used as crew-served weapons or as weapons for powered armor-the big Mardukans had been thrown into the ship in a second wave and immediately charged into the battle . The Vasin cavalry had rushed from position to position , ambushing the bewildered commandos , who could not believe that " scummies " using cannon as personal weapons were really roaming all over their ship , opening shuttle bay doors to vacuum and generally causing as much havoc as they could . And while the ... individualistic Vasin had been doing that , the Diaspran infantry had taken one hard point after another , all of them heavily defended positions , by laying down plasma fire as if it were the rank-upon-rank musketry which was their specialty . And they 'd paid a heavy price for their victory . In the end , the ship had been taken , but only at the cost of far too many more dead and horribly injured . And the ship itself had been largely gutted by the savage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were n't designed to survive the effect of five Mardukans abreast , packed bulkhead-to-bulkhead in a passage and volley-firing blast after blast of plasma . What was left of the ship was a job for a professional space dock , but that was out of question . Jackson Adoula , Prince of Kellerman , and Roger 's despised father , the Earl of New Madrid , had made that impossible when they murdered his brother and sister and all of his brother 's children , massacred the Empress ' Own , and somehow gained total control of the Empress herself . Never in her wildest dreams would Alexandra MacClintock have closely associated herself with Jackson Adoula , whom she despised and distrusted . And far less would she ever have married New Madrid , whose treasonous tendencies she 'd proven to her own satisfaction before Roger was ever born . Indeed , New Madrid 's treason was the reason she 'd never married him ... and a large part of the explanation for her distrust of Roger himself . Yet according to the official news services , Adoula had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time she had announced she did intend to wed New Madrid . Which seemed only reasonable , the newsies pointed out , since they were the men responsible for somehow thwarting the coup attempt which had so nearly succeeded . The coup which , according to those same official news services , had been instigated by none other than Prince Roger ... at the very instant that he 'd been fighting for his life against ax- wielding Boman barbarians on sunny Marduk . Something , to say the least , was rotten in Imperial City . And whatever it was , it meant that instead of simply taking the spaceport and sending home a message " Mommy , come pick me up , " the battered warriors at Roger 's back now had the unenviable task of retaking the entire Empire from the traitors who were somehow controlling the Empress . The survivors of Bravo Company-all twelve of them - and the remaining two hundred and ninety members of The Basik 's Own , pitted against one hundred and twenty star systems , with a population right at three-quarters of a trillion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make their task a bit more daunting , they had a time problem . Alexandra was " pregnant " -a new scion had been popped into the uterine replicator , a full brother of Roger 's , from his mother 's and father 's genetic material-and under Imperial law , now that Roger had been officially attainted for treason , that fetus became the new Heir Primus as soon as he was born . Roger 's advisers concurred that his mother 's life would last about as long as spit on a hot griddle when that uterine replicator was opened . Which explained the still dwindling mushroom cloud . When the Saints came looking for their missing ship , or an Imperial carrier finally showed up to wonder why Old Earth had n't heard from Marduk in so long , it would appear a pirate vessel had pillaged the facility and then vanished into the depths of space . What it would not look like was the first step in a counter coup intended to regain the Throne for House MacClintock . He took one last look at the viewscreens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the ship 's wardroom . Although the wardroom itself had escaped damage during the fighting , the route there was somewhat hazardous . The approaches to the bridge had taken tremendous damage-indeed , the decks and bulkheads of the short security corridor outside the command deckhead been sublimed into gas by plasma fire from both sides . A narrow , flexing , carbon-fiber catwalk had been built as a temporary walkway , and they crossed it carefully , one at a time . The passageway beyond was n't much better . Many of the holes in the deck had been repaired , but others were simply outlined in bright yellow paint , and in many places , the bulkheads reminded Roger forcibly of Old Earth Swiss cheese . He and his staffers picked their way around the unrepaired holes in the deck and finally reached the wardroom 's dilating hatch , and Roger seated himself at the head of the table . He leaned back , apparently entirely at ease , as the lizard curled into a ball by his side . His calm demeanor fooled no one . Continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
