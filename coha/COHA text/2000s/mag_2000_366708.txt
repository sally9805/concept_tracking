When an eccentric old Mongolian walked into the backyard of a laid-back American poet in 1987 , neither imagined , surely , that they would one day be lurching through modern China in search of a teacher 's grave . But Tsing Tsai proved to be no ordinary monk , poet and kung-fu master ; and George Crane turned out to be a sympathetic Sancho Panza and inner Mongolian at heart . Written with the quick , vivid immediacy of an ancient Eastern poem , Bones beautifully recounts the recent heartbreaking history of Mongolia  --  and shows how spirit can get the better of even the deepest sorrow . <P>  --  By Pico Iyer
