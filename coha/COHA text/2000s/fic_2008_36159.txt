St. Luke 's , a beautiful stone church on the outskirts of Crozet , Virginia , appeared even more stunning than usual given the fresh snow on the rooftops , the windowsills of the parish office , and the pastor 's living quarters across the now-white quad . Plumes of smoke rose from the great hall , which formed one side of the quad , and smoke spiraled from the parish office . The church was built in 1803 , and it was clear that those early Lutherans needed many fireplaces . Over the centuries the buildings had been wired , vented , and plumbed . The modern conveniences served to enhance comfort . The structures had to last for centuries and no doubt would endure more improvements over ensuing centuries . <br> As Harry Haristeen walked across the large quad to the great hall , her two cats and corgi behind her , she wondered if people today could build as securely as our forefathers did . Seemed like things were built to fall apart . Grateful that she lived in an old farmhouse built about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to the work party long enough to make a snowball and throw it up in the air . <br> Tucker , the corgi , jumped up to catch it . As she did , the snowball chilled her teeth , so she dropped it . <br> " Dumb ! " Pewter , the portly gray cat , laughed . <br> " I knew it would do that , but if she throws a ball , I have to catch it . That 's my job , " Tucker defended herself . <br> Harry decided to sprint the last two hundred yards to warm up . <br> The tiger cat , Mrs. Murphy , shot past her . The shoveled walkway was covered with inches of fresh snow but easily negotiable . <br> Pewter , hating to be outdone , could n't get around Harry so she leapt onto the snow , where she promptly sank . <br> Tucker , trotting on the path , called out , " Dumb . " <br> A snow triangle like a coolie hat on her head did not cool down Pewter 's temper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path . Running right up to Tucker 's butt , she reached out and gave the dog a terrific swat . <br> Tucker growled , stooped to whirl around . <br> Harry commanded over her shoulder , " That 's enough , you two . " <br> " You 're lucky she saved your fat rear end . " Pewter flattened her ears to look extra mean . <br> " Ooh la . " The dog now ignored the cat , which was far more upsetting than a knock-down/drag-out to Pewter , who felt the world revolved around her . <br> Upon entering the great hall , Harry inhaled the fragrance of oak burning in the two fireplaces , one at either end . The aroma of a well-tended fire added to winter 's allure . Harry loved all the seasons . Winter 's purity appealed to her . She loved being able to see the spine of the land , loved popping into a friend 's house for a hot chocolate or serving the same . Born and raised here , she was buoyed up by close friendships . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't imagine that emotion . Tied to the land , the people and animals that inhabited it , Harry knew she was a lucky soul . <br> " Look at those hardworking women , " she called out as she removed her coat , hat , gloves , and scarf . <br> Alicia Palmer and BoomBoom Craycroft , both great beauties , moved a long table near the eastern fireplace . The large room cost so much to heat that the thermostat stayed at fifty-two . The fireplaces helped considerably . Sitting near one kept one 's fingers from stiffening , and they 'd need their fingers today . <br> Alicia , a former movie star , now in her fifties , was in charge of decorations for the Christmas party , which was little more than a week away . Each season St. Luke 's hosted a large party that brought parishioners and neighbors together in a relaxed setting . Reverend Herb Jones , the pastor , constantly came up with ways to strengthen the community . <br> Susan Tucker , Harry 's best friend from cradle days , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> Racquel Deeds and Jean Keelo , two former sorority sisters from Miami University in Ohio , laid out gorgeous dried magnolia grand flora blossoms along with the large , shiny dark-green leaves . <br> BoomBoom brought bay leaves and gold-beaded strands . <br> Harry carried dried red roses along with strands of cranberries . <br> Once the women settled down at the table to make wreaths , the cats and dog volunteered to help . <br> Mrs. Murphy , on the table , played with the gold beads . " Are n't these the same kind of beads that men throw to women at Mardi Gras if the women expose their glories ? " <br> " Sure wo n't be flashing anything in this weather . " Tucker , on the floor , laughed . <br> Pewter batted around a lovely red rosebud . " I will never understand why humans pitch a fit and fall in it if someone shows their breasts or if a man shows his equipment . I mean , everybody has them . " <br> " Genesis . Remember when the angel comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam and Eve realize they are naked ? " Mrs. Murphy read over Harry 's shoulder , not that Harry knew the cat could fathom it . <br> " Ha . Adam was taking money under the table from the garment industry . " Pewter swept her tail over the table , knocking rosebuds on the floor . <br> " If you do n't behave , missy , you 're going on the floor , " Harry chided Pewter . <br> " If you give me treats , I 'll be an angel . " <br> " Liar , liar , your pants are on fire , " Mrs. Murphy sassed . <br> That fast , Pewter charged the tiger cat , the gold beads entangled between them . The two boxed . Harry stood up , separating the cats to save the beads . <br> Off the table , the two chased each other around the room . <br> " Anyone bring Valium for cats ? " asked BoomBoom . <br> " Remind me next time to stock up , " Harry replied . <br> Racquel and Jean had married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Bryson Deeds took a slot in the cardiology department at the University of Virginia hospital . He 'd gone on to become one of the leading cardiologists in the country . Bill Keelo , his best friend , specialized in tax law . He , too , flourished . Both men earned very good money , and their wives reflected being well-tended . Of the two , Racquel was obsessed with her looks and appearing young . <br> While both wives were very attractive , any woman paled next to Alicia or BoomBoom . The funny thing was , neither of these great beauties fussed over themselves all that much , which only made them more alluring . <br> Harry , good-looking but not drop-dead gorgeous , lived in jeans . Since she farmed , this was as it should be , but every now and then Alicia , BoomBoom , and Susan would gang up on her and drag her to stores to find dresses . It took three of them to make her do it . <br> Although Racquel and Jean had not grown up with everyone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right in . <br> " You know , this really is lovely . " Susan held up a wreath of magnolia leaves , white magnolia blossoms , red rosebuds , and gold beads wrapped diagonally around the wreath . <br> " This looks pretty good , too . A little more plain , perhaps . " Harry held up the bay leaf wreath with cranberries wrapped around it , set off with large pale-green bows and speckled with tiny gold stars . <br> " The odor . That 's what makes the bay leaf wreaths so special . " Jean adored the fragrance . <br> " What are we going to do with the grapevines ? " Susan was twisting some , now pliable from being soaked in water , into lovely wreaths . <br> " Well , I thought we could put one big bow on the bottom and tie in the wooden carved figures from that plastic carton . " Alicia pointed to the carton . <br> Susan asked , " Want me to do that now ? " <br> Alicia answered , " No , let 's make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should be able to handle the two huge wreaths for in here . " <br> " How huge ? " Harry wondered . <br> " Three feet in diameter , " Alicia replied . <br> " That is huge . " Harry was surprised . <br> " It will take two of us to make each one , then hang them over each fireplace , but they will look spectacular . " Alicia felt confident about that . <br> One of the outside doors opened . Rushing in were the three Lutheran cats , Cazenovia , Elocution , and Lucy Fur , followed by Herb Jones , wearing no coat . <br> " Rev , you 'll catch your death . " Harry called him Rev. <br> " Oh , I just ran over from the office . " He glanced at the few finished wreaths and the pile of materials on the table as the cats , now five in number , roared through the great hall . " These are so pretty . " <br> " Thought about adding walnuts , but I do n't think they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Alicia 's come up with other ideas . She 's the boss . " <br> " I 'm grateful to you girls for doing this . " Herb smiled at them . " Do you all need anything ? Food ? Drink ? " <br> " Brought it , " Jean replied . " Dip into either of those coolers . You 'll be happy . " <br> Rarely able to resist food , Herb flipped up both lids . " Are those your famous turkey and cranberry sandwiches ? " <br> " The same , " Jean replied . <br> Herb picked out one , as well as a Coca-Cola . " I 'm going to eat and run . Actually , I 'll eat in the office . Oh , Racquel , how 's Aunt Phillipa doing ? " <br> " Thank God for the Brothers of Love Hospice . Her mind remains clear , but I doubt she 'll make it to spring . Emphysema takes you down . " Racquel looked up at him . <br> Jean added , " The brothers have been wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's inspirational to learn each monk 's history . Everyone is there to atone for some wrongdoing . " <br> Racquel said , " Atoning twice . Some have been in jail . " <br> " Do you really think a leopard can change his spots ? " Harry , ever the questioner , said . <br> Herb replied in a deep voice , " Some can and some ca n't . I doubt it 's easy , and as I recall most of them were first corrupted by greed or lust . " <br> " Women and song pushed them on the path , " Susan good-naturedly suggested . <br> Herb turned to leave , noticing the cats carrying on like sin . " Jean , a turkey sandwich , if you have an extra , might settle these hellions down . " <br> " Brought plenty . Would you like another ? " <br> " No , this is fine . " He left to dash back across the quad . <br> Alicia rose to throw more logs onto the fire , the fireplace being quite large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to think people can change . " <br> " I would , too , but it seems to me that some corruptions are more easily overcome than others . " Harry selected a deep-red rosebud . <br> " Sex . That 's harder to fix than greed . Or should I say lust ? " Racquel said . <br> " Really ? I think money trumps everything in our culture , " Susan replied . <br> " I do n't think so . " Racquel offered her argument in the best sense of the word . " Lust is irrational . The desire for money is rational . " <br> " But are n't the seven deadly sins all irrational ? I mean , when it gets to that level of an obsession . " BoomBoom , like most people among friends , did n't mind taking a bit of grammatical license . <br> Important as good grammar can be , it can also be stultifying in free-flowing conversation . <br> " Okay . How do you know when it 's reached the level of obsession ? " Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe it 's different for each person , " Jean offered . <br> BoomBoom , whose husband died young , had entered into a string of affairs with men , one of whom was Fair Haristeen , D.V.M. , Harry 's husband . They were separated at the time , and Harry subsequently divorced him . He worked on himself , kept after her for years once he recognized his error , and finally won her back . Nothing happens in a vacuum . Harry had to realize that she contributed to his wandering by focusing on whatever tasks presented themselves to her . She could have focused on him a little more . She was learning . <br> " Would n't a sign be if you knew you should slow down but you speeded up ? " The corgi added canine conversation to this topic . <br> Just then , led by Mrs. Murphy , the cats leapt onto the table , running from end to end . Grapevines hit the floor ; rosebuds skidded off the table . BoomBoom quickly secured the magnolia blossoms , as they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry . I should never have brought these monsters , " Harry apologized . <br> " Oh , the Rev 's cats would have done the honors . " BoomBoom , an animal lover , laughed . <br> What was a little cleanup compared to watching animals love life ? <br> " We would not . We 're Christian cats , " Lucy Fur protested , prudently jumping off the table . <br> " Ha . " Pewter jumped off , too . " Lucy Fur , you 're the most Christian at dinnertime . " <br> " You should talk , lard-ass . " Cazenovia , the long-haired calico , now chased Pewter . <br> " May I ? " Harry got up and opened the cooler . <br> " Under the circumstances , I think it imperative . " Jean smiled . <br> Once the torn-up sandwich was on the floor , paper towels underneath , the cats settled down . Tucker received half a sandwich , too . Water was put out for them . <br> The great hall boasted a kitchen good enough for a fancy restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big Viking stove , and other items to delight a chef . <br> Back at the table , Harry plopped down . <br> " Those sandwiches smell good . " Susan 's remark encouraged the ladies to take a food break . <br> " You mentioned that Aunt Phillipa 's mind is clear . How is she taking this ? " Alicia asked Racquel . <br> " With fortitude . She 's eighty-six . She 's ready to go . Fighting to breathe robs any delight one might harbor . But she amazes me . So do the brothers . I did n't think I 'd much like them hovering about , but they 've been good . Well , Christopher Hewitt is n't too good . Brother Morris , " she mentioned the prior , " says he has to do some hospice work . Mostly Christopher runs the Christmas tree farm . He knows how to make money . Bryson is there more than I am , so Aunt Phillipa receives lots of attention . He has two elderly patients there , as well . " <br> BoomBoom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as did Harry , Fair , and Susan , said , " I have n't seen Christopher since he joined the brotherhood . Not that we were bosom buddies before . " <br> " Heard he became a brother after he got out of jail in Arizona . Money led him down the garden path . I am going over to the Christmas tree farm later , and maybe he 'll be there . " Harry was looking forward to picking out a tree . <br> Susan spoke to Alicia , Racquel , and Jean , who did not go to Crozet High School . " Christopher was a year behind Harry and me . He was handsome . And he was always elected treasurer of whatever group he was in . " <br> " Good training . " BoomBoom laughed . <br> " That comes back to my question , " said Harry . " Can a leopard change his spots ? I do n't know all of the details , but Christopher was a stockbroker , became involved in insider trading , losing millions of clients ' money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed my spots . " BoomBoom laughed again , at herself this time . <br> " Oh , you were never that bad . " Susan liked her school chum , although she sided with Harry during the affair , which was natural . <br> " Bad enough . " Harry laughed , too . " But is n't it funny how things turn out ? All three of us have grown closer . " <br> BoomBoom became serious . " The truth is I did n't know what love was until I met Alicia . I was running on empty and running from man to man . " <br> " You sweet thing , " Alicia said . <br> Continues ...
