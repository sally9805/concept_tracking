Quitman , texas ( pop . 2,000 ) , is not listed in tourism brochures as the hip music capital of the Lone Star State . But it 's doing its part . The tiny town is the home base of Shea Seger , the 21-year-old singer-songwriter behind one of this year 's smartest debuts , The May Street Project ( RCA ) . " Growing up , I hated the smallness of the town , " says Seger , who was born in Fort Worth but moved to Quitman when she was four years old . " Now I respect it for its simplicity . " Seger has also lived in a number of other places , including Virginia Beach , Va . ( where she embraced rap ) , and London , ( where she launched her singing career in earnest at age 19 ) . Her music reflects her itinerant upbringing : her album has some elements of hip-hop ( it was mixed by Commissioner Gordon , who also worked on Lauryn Hill 's hip-hop masterpiece The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill ) , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of country twang . " I 'm a soul singer , " says Seger . " But I like to rock too . " <P> Seger is part of a new sisterhood of soul . In recent months , a wave of promising R.-and-B. divas has hit the radio and video airwaves , including big-voiced newcomer Alicia Keys ( Songs in A Minor ) , neo-soul singer Res ( How I Do ) and soul-rock crooner Nikka Costa ( Like a Feather , the single from her recently released album Everybody Got Their Something , is one of the year 's catchiest songs ) . All these young soul crooners make music that 's tinged with rap rhythms : the hip-hop gives their work an edge , while the soul makes it all go down easy . Seger 's work stands out because she takes a slightly different route  --  leading her style of hip-hop-tinged pop-soul down the back roads of East Texas . <P> The May Street Project  --  named after a street in Quitman  --  is a surprisingly smooth listen for an album that boasts such seemingly disparate influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality to them ; images and melodies twirl around in tiny zephyrs of sound . Twisted ( Never Again ) sounds like echoes from a carnival , with spinning ferris-wheel-like choruses and offbeat funhouse instrumentation . On the bluesy I Ca n't Lie , Seger lets herself go , howling some of the final lines with a gleeful abandon that evokes a carefree Janis Joplin . <P> One of the album 's best tracks is Always , a duet between Seger and Canadian troubadour Ron Sexsmith . Seger has a bright , brittle voice , like a leaf that 's turned some colorful shade of autumn . Her vocals contrast nicely with Sexsmith 's plaintive tenor . Always has some elements a listener might associate with folk or country  --  including gentle acoustic-guitar work  --  but the track , tastefully sweetened with synthesizers , never settles into any one genre . " I know what I want to see , " sings Seger on the song . " And I know where I want to be . " Seger may have a peripatetic past , but she 's right at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farley
