/Jan 2000 I like my children slick as seals , bathed in oils , combed-back hair , done up in flannelette pyjamas and terry-towel robes . Oh , the smell of them . Their shininess . They 've slithered out of a hot tub , remnants of bubbles still stuck to bottoms . They 've used copious amounts of hair products and a large number of towels . Mary Martin sings " Peter Pan " on the tape machine and all the lights are off . As they warm under the red glow of the bathroom heat lamp , the dimness starts to work its special sleepy magic , transporting them to a place of golden galleons and that dark and sinister man , Hook . On wintery evenings , my three boys , squeaky clean from this ritual , thunder down the stairs and slap the wall switch that niftily starts up the gas fire . With a surfeit of comforters and a snack , we snuggle in front of the hearth , creating our very own counterpane land . The wind can howl all it wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is our moment of peace . It is bedtime . One boy is cradled between my legs , the other two are on either side and we commence Storytime . I capitalize this to convey its huge importance in our home . Bedtime is decompression time , and in a two-career household there 's hardly enough of that . And so this process becomes largely predictable . That 's the point : the comfort of sameness . It can not be compromised . On rushed evenings , when straight-to-bed would be the efficient end to the day , even a suggestion of such a shortcut brings wails of " I want sto-o-o-r-r-y ! " The protestation is heartfelt . It is time to get close . What is this connection at the end of the day ? Gordon Wells ( no relation ) , a professor at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education of the University of Toronto , mentions something that strikes me . Storytime is a place , he says , where adults and children , young and old , " meet intellectually as well as physically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meeting ground for some imaginary event . " I like that  --  the notion that parent and child become co-conspirators in the pursuit of the imaginary , and that physical intimacy enhances the journey . Wells adds that reading the same books , or telling the same stories , over and over again , gives the child an ability to anticipate and predict , and that " raises the emotional temperature a bit . " So true . I remember from my own youth , my father walking into my bedroom , the crisp smell of our Winnipeg winter arriving with him , his oxblood shoes snapping across the hardwood . He would not be carrying a book , for he was an improvisational narrator , shelling the nut of a much-loved story and retelling it , more or less , in short form . My father would work himself into a chilling rendition of either The Hound of the Baskervilles or Poe 's The Tell-Tale Heart . Hearing these stories the first time was spine-tingling . Having them retold , the anticipation of it , the thump , thump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mother was more conventional , choosing wholly comforting readings . She often reached for A.A. Milne 's Now We Are Six and told of Bad King John who desperately wanted Father Christmas to bring him a " big , red india-rubber ball , " signing his wishful request " very humbly , Jack . " Very humbly , Jack . I can still hear my mother reciting that line . I can almost capture the strange , powdery scent of the hot-water bottle , the sensation of being wrapped in an envelope of flannel . The memories sharpen as I read to my own boys . Our library is varied , if predictable . Munsch , The Screech Owl Series , anything by Roald Dahl . The fail-safe choice that is sure to please all three , even the ten-year-old , is Shel Silverstein 's Where the Sidewalk Ends . " Captain Hook must remember Not to scratch his toes . " Storytime starts at 7:30 p.m. , with each boy slotted into bed at half-hour intervals . So the first half hour 's reading must appeal to little Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight . Will is carried to bed at 8 . There is a procedure that must be followed here . He burrows under the blanket post-story , a game that involves my pretending he 's not there , uttering great noises of discomfort over the lumpiness of the comforters , then " discovering " him amid his shrieks of enjoyment . To be carried upside down to bed after this sport is the piece de resistance . In bed , Will roots under his own comforter for his Thing  --  and Thing is the proper name for it  --  which is a shredded border from a long-ago cotton blanket . Thing lies like a snake waiting for its master , who no longer runs his fingers up and down it like a pianist in warm-up , but must have it there nevertheless . Psychology texts tell us that 60 percent of children in Western cultures adopt soft items  --  a piece of cloth , a toy  --  as objects of comfort . A year ago , Jake would check each night on his doll , Rosie , who was tucked away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived there because Jake did n't want anyone to know that he cared for Rosie still . He does not check on her anymore . Now , each night after story , he takes his shocking pink highlighter and crosses another day off the Elvis Presley calendar . Jake 's bedtime is 8:30 , so 30 minutes of the storytelling is adjusted to his level . He likes riddles and rhymes and detective stories . Before he heads upstairs , my middle son gives his long flaxen hair , a strong , therapeutic brush . In winter he likes to wear his socks over his pyjama bottoms , pulled to his knees if possible  --  giving him the jaunty look of a Victorian-era golfer . He also likes to organize his clothes for the following school day . If that entails wearing his Montreal Canadiens jersey , he 'll set out a tricolour hair scrunchie set  --  red , white and blue  --  to match . The last boy in is Chris , still the biggest snuggler of the three . He chooses a chapter book , and we read for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between , he will speak of the day gone by , of the math challenge he could not meet , of the schoolyard bully who threatened him and called him " kid , " as in , " Hey , kid , you 'd better not touch that ball . " Bedtime becomes therapy time , when all the concerns and fears of the day , and anxieties about tomorrow , come tumbling out . To bed and then a kiss goodnight . A friend of mine recalls that her mother , in saying goodnight to six children , youngest first , had a way about her that made them believe she was gathering up all the day 's problems and carrying them off in a blanket . In our home , as perhaps in yours , to go to bed is not precisely to stay in bed . There must first be the rooting out of a spider that has appeared . Quiet minutes pass , perhaps a half hour . Then there might be the sound of Chris , our nightmare boy , shooting down the stairs , imagining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a bedroom all his own , painted to his specifications : a ragged midnight-blue ceiling , silver stars . But he has yet to move in and remains in the shared room with his brothers . And so I take Chris by the hand and lead him back to his bed . I kiss him on the forehead and call him Smoochie , which he seems to like . For years he has asked to be checked on in five minutes . I have only just noticed , in writing this story , that he is making this request less often . If I 've got the energy , I 'll sit on the bottom bunk and whisper a tale of my own  --  the day we tossed my younger sister out the dining-room window into the vast prairie snowbank is a particular favourite . The glimmer from the hallway light casts a glow on the faces of my sleeping boys . I can almost hear parents everywhere clicking off bedroom lights , softly rustling out of children 's rooms . The day is done . I ca n't deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconvenience . But in this quiet moment , I cherish the long goodnight and know that when it 's gone , I will miss it forever . <p>
