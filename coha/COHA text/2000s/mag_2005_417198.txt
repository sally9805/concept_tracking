Soothe minor cuts , scrapes , burns and bruises - safely and naturally . Photograph // An estimated 80 percent of minor injuries occur at home . While some cuts , burns and blisters require immediate medical attention ( see " Red Flags , " on Page 145 ) , others can be effectively treated with simple first aid . When stocking a first-aid kit to deal with these inevitable accidents , do n't overlook the many natural products that can speed healing and reduce the risk of infection . These include items you may already have on hand , such as vitamin C , aloe and honey . WHEN THE SKIN IS BROKEN To treat minor wounds , it 's helpful to understand how the body responds to injuries . The skin , which is the body 's largest organ , has two layers - the epidermis and the dermis . The epidermis is the thin layer ( about five cells deep ) that 's in direct contact with the environment ; it is also host to millions of bacteria and other microorganisms . Ordinarily , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you suffer a minor wound that breaks the skin . Beneath the epidermis is the dermis . When a wound tears the dermis , microorganisms from the epidermis invade and threaten infection , and the immune system works to close the breach and kill the germs . Blood vessels around the wound dilate , and extra blood rushes into the area , rinsing the wound and cleaning it . The extra blood also carries a small army of white blood cells that attack infectioncausing microorganisms . This process causes inflammation - swelling , redness and pain around the wound . Cells injured by the wound die , but before they expire , they release a protein that triggers blood clotting , which eventually forms a scab that closes the wound . After about 24 hours , other white blood cells release proteins that stimulate the repair of injured bloodvessels and the creation of new skin cells and collagen . Sometimes the process is less than perfect , and collagen forms where you should have skin , resulting in a scar . Wounds also can get infected - in this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made up of dead bacteria and white blood cells , may ooze from your scab . However , if all goes well , minor wounds should heal completely , and the simple remedies below can help speed that process . HEAL WITH VITAMIN C No matter what kind of wound you have , taking vitamin C can help , whether you get it from fruit juice or from supplements . Low blood levels of vitamin C slow healing , while high levels speed formation of new skin cells and collagen , according to Dr. Melvyn Werbach , author of Nutritional Influences on Illness . Studies conducted on vitamin C date back to the 1930s , and recent research has confirmed these effects . In a 1996 study , British researchers gave bedsore sufferers standard care plus either a placebo or vitamin C ( 500 milligrams twice daily ) . After one month , the average sore areas shrank by 43 percent in the placebo group and 84 percent in the vitamin group . New York City-based nutritionist Shari lieberman , co-author of The Real Vitamin and Mineral Book , suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per day if you have a large wound or burn . However , large doses of vitamin C can cause diarrhea . If this occurs , reduce your dose . Other research suggests that vitamin E and zinc also promote wound healing and reduce the risk of scarring . As wounds heal , Lieberman recommends a daily dose of 400 to 800 International Units ( IU ) of vitamin E and 30 to 50 milligrams of zinc . Photograph // REDUCE YOUR STRESS LEVEL Emotional stress impairs immune function . So it comes as no surprise that stress also interferes with wound healing . Ohio State University researchers studied 26 women , half of whom were stressed by caring for spouses with Alzheimer 's disease . The researchers inflicted identical minor puncture wounds on all the women , then treated them with an antiseptic ( hydrogen peroxide ) and tracked the wounds as they healed . Healing took significantly longer among the Alzheimer 's caregivers ( 49 days versus 39 ) . However , effective stress management accelerates wound healing . Researchers at Southeastern Louisiana University worked with 24 people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgery , half received standard care , while half were given audio tapes containing a relaxation program . A day later , the relaxation group showed less anxiety , lower blood levels of the stress hormone cortisol and less inflammation from the surgical incision . Any relaxation program can help , including meditation , yoga , tai chi , visualization exercises or listening to music . ( For more on reducing stress , see " Running from Bears , " Page 126 . ) HERBAL HEALING A number of herbs can be safe and effective for aiding your skin in healing . Chamomile ( Matricaria recutita ) makes a tasty , calming tea . The oils in this herb are also anti-inflammatory , antibacterial and promote skin regeneration . That 's why Germany 's Commission E , the government panel that judges the safety and efficacy of herbal medicines , recommends the herb for wound healing . Make a strong tea using 1 heaping teaspoon of flowers per cup of boiling water . Steep until cool . Apply using a compress . Comfrey ( Symphytum officinale ) contains allantoin , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author of The Green Pharmacy , suggests applying fresh , washed and bruised leaves directly to wounds as a poultice , or applying comfrey as a paste of powdered leaves . ( You could also try skin-care products that contain comfrey , available at health food stores . ) Photograph The gel inside this aloe plant 's leaves can help heal minor cuts and burns . You can buy skin-care products with aloe , or just keep one of the plants around the house . // In recent years , comfrey 's reputation has suffered because it contains compounds that can cause liver damage when ingested . You should n't ingest this herb , but there 's no danger in using it externally for wound healing . Calendula ( Calendula officinalis ) has been used for centuries to help heal wounds , and Commission E also recommends calendula for wound healing . Brew a tea using 1 to 2 teaspoons of dried flowers per cup of boiling water . Steep until cool . Apply using a compress , or mix 1 to 2 teaspoons of tincture in a cup of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been used to heal wounds in India for centuries . It 's no wonder : The Asiatic herb 's acid stimulates collagen synthesis . Gotu kola salves are available at some health food stores and herb shops , or you can apply a compress containing tincture , liquid extract or tea . For tea , use 2 teaspoons of dried leaves per cup of boiling water . Steep until cool . FIRST AID BASICS Follow the steps below to handle common household injuries : Care for Cuts * The bleeding from cuts usually stops by itself . If not , apply direct pressure until it does . * Immediately wash cuts carefully with soap and water . * Apply antiseptic . Doctors often suggest iodine , antibacterial ointments and hydrogen peroxide , all available at pharmacies . Aloe , tea tree oil and honey , however , are equally effective natural alternatives . The gel inside Aloe vera 's fleshy leaves is best known as a treatment for minor burns , but it also helps treat cuts . In fact , aloe became medically prominent more than 2,000 years ago when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for battle wounds . Modern researchers have identified several reasons why aloe gel spurs wound healing : It has antibacterial , antifungal and antiviral compounds that help prevent wound infections . It also has immune-stimulating and anti-inflammatory compounds , and it stimulates collagen synthesis and skin regeneration . Aloe contains vitamins C and E , plus the mineral zinc . " Most household cuts and burns occur in the kitchen , " San Francisco-based family doctor Anne Simons says . " Keep a potted aloe plant in yours , and you 'll have fresh gel handy whenever you need it . Just snip off a leaf , slit it open , scoop out the gel and apply it . " Photograph // When British explorer Capt . James Cook first arrived in Australia in 1777 , he found the indigenous people treating wounds with crushed tea tree leaves ( Melaleuca alternifolid ) . The oil in tea tree leaves is a powerful antiseptic . " I use tea tree oil on wounds , " Duke says . " It 's as good as any nonherbal antiseptic . " Ancient Egyptian medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were onto something - honey has potent antibacterial action . British researchers cultured all the bacteria that commonly cause surgical wound infections and then placed two drops of honey in each petri dish . Honey treatment substantially inhibited most bacterial growth . Another option , according to Dr. Richard Knutson , an orthopedic surgeon in Greenville , Miss. , is to use a paste made from granulated sugar and water . Sugar also helps prevent infection and speeds healing . Photograph // Beat the Pain of Burns * Cool it . As quickly as possible , run cold water over minor burns , or use an ice pack . Place a few ice cubes in a plastic bag wrapped in a cloth ( or use a commercial cold pack ) . Apply for 20 minutes , then wait 10 minutes before applying again . Flushing with cool water is especially important for chemical burns caused by drain , oven and toilet cleaners . Flush the area with cool water continuously for 15 to 30 minutes . If the chemical container is available , read and follow the first-aid instructions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspirin , acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) or ibuprofen ( Motrin , Advil ) . A natural alternative is white willow bark ( Salix spp. ) , which contains pain-relieving compounds similar to aspirin . Commission E endorses white willow bark for treatment of pain . For a decoction , soak 1 teaspoon of powdered bark per cup of cold water for eight hours . Strain . Drink up to 3 cups a day with honey and/or lemon . If you 're sensitive to aspirin , do not use willow - the herb may upset your stomach . Photograph // * Apply aloe . Aloe first came to modern medical attention in the 1930s , with a medical journal report that the herb helped heal burns inflicted by radiation treatments . In 1995 , Thai researchers treated 27 people with second-degree burns with either aloe gel or petroleum jelly under gauze dressings . The average time to healing in the petroleum jelly group was more than 18 days . In the aloe group , it was about 11 days . * Spread on honey . Indian researchers treated burn victims using either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey group 's burns healed twice as quickly ( nine days versus 18 days ) . * Herbalists and aromatherapists Kathi Keville and Mindy Green , co-authors of Aromatherapy : A Complete Guide to the Healing Art , suggest placing a few drops of lavender oil on burns or mixing three drops each of lavender oil , tea tree oil , chamomile oil and calendula oil , and applying the mixture to the burn . * Do n't break blisters . When burns cause blisters , it 's tempting to pop them , but doing so risks infection . If blisters break on their own , wash the area thoroughly with soap and water , then cover with gauze soaked with honey , aloe , lavender oil or tea tree oil . Wash the broken blister and change the bandage and dressing once a day . Banish Your Bruises Bruises are red , blue or purple marks on the skin . Around the eyes , they 're called black eyes . Bruises occur when a fall or blow leaves the skin intact but damages the capillaries beneath it . People bruise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragile . * Apply an ice pack as quickly as possible . Ice reduces pain and swelling . Do not take aspirin or use willow bark - they are anticoagulants and prolong bleeding . * Take bromelain . This enzyme is abundant in pineapple and has antiinflammatory action . Bromelain is available at health food stores and supplement shops ( chewable varieties of bromelain supplements taste delicious ) , or you can eat more pineapple . IF INFECTION DEVELOPS As wounds begin to heal , pain , tenderness , redness and swelling should subside . If they persist or get worse , the wound is infected . Minor infections can be treated safely at home by washing with soap and water , soaking the affected area in warm water and applying aloe , honey , lavender and tea tree oil . But if symptoms continue - especially if pus begins oozing - see a doctor . Sidebar Red Flags Consult a physician promptly for : * Cuts that wo n't stop bleeding , or those with jagged edges that wo n't come together . You may need stitches . * Wounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove . The wound should be professionally cleaned . * Any burn over an area larger than your hand ( except sunburn ) . * Burns that produce extensive blistering , or any blister more than 1 inch across . * Any human or animal bites that break your skin . Animal bites carry considerable risk of infection .
