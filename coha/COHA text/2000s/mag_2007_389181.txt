Sidebar TAKING A STRATEGIC CHECK-UP THIS MAY BE a good time for you to sit back and put your organization 's strategy implementation efforts through a complete physical examination to identify areas of strength , along with those where performance is inconsistent , not being addressed , or at risk . Think about the seven killers of strategy implementation and ask yourself : Do we initiate the projects that we need ? * We launch the initiatives that enable us to implement our strategy effectively and efficiently . * Our resource-intensive initiatives are commissioned because of the needs of the business rather than being rooted in ego , power , or the negotiating skill of the initiator. * Projects officially are launched as opposed to " just happening . " * The approval process does not discourage people from proposing worthwhile initiatives . Do we have the right quantity and mix of projects in our portfolio ? * We know our project capacity ( i.e. , how many person-hours per month we can dedicate to special projects without compromising ongoing operations ) . * Strategic initiatives and lower-impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have the discipline and attention span to stick with needed initiatives ( rather than abandoning them in favor of sexy new projects and campaigns to " get back to the basics " of daily operations ) . * The executive team regularly takes stock of our project portfolio , using criteria derived from the strategy to ensure that we are working on the correct things . Does our organization structure support optimum Initiative execution ? * We have a central clearinghouse ( " initiative central " ) for project monitoring , control , and reporting . * We have assigned an appropriate owner of the process through which projects are generated , defined , prioritized , scheduled , staffed , deployed , monitored , and closed out . * Someone is responsible for " connecting the dots " among related projects ( e.g. , ensuring that the marketing initiative is in concert with the order fulfillment initiative ) . * A person or group is responsible for identifying and surfacing cross-project conflicts ( e.g. , two projects making impossible demands on a single resource , one project optimizing in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person or group is responsible for providing the executive team with a holistic picture of overall project portfolio performance ( the " helicopter view " of the entire initiative waterfront ) . Do we have an Initiative-friendly culture ? * If a project achieves its objectives on time and within budget , there are positive consequences for the sponsor , project manager , and team members . If a project fails to achieve its intent or exceeds its planned resources , there are negative consequences . Sidebar * Individuals at all levels see strategic Initiatives as the engines for propelling us forward rather than distractions from the real business of making products and serving customers . * People get frequent , pinpointed , balanced feedback on their initiative performance . Projects adequately are factored into our performance appraisal system and our informal day-to-day feedback . * Being assigned as a project manager or team member generally is perceived as a vote of confidence . Do we establish appropriate project roles ? * Executives play the appropriate initiative sponsor role . * Projects are staffed with the " best and brightest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has minimal impact . * Project managers and team members understand fully the roles that they should and should not be playing . * When asked about an initiative , members of the target population ( those intended to be affected by project results ) usually know that it is underway ; understand its purpose ; can define what it means to them ; and think it will have a positive impact . Do we have a robust , practical Initiative management methodology ? * We have developed or adopted a process through which projects are defined , planned , implemented , and closed out . * Our initiative management process is robust enough to address the needs of complex projects , but simple enough to be understood and used by project contributors at all levels . * We have an organization-wide common approach and language for project management . * Projects begin with a game plan , as opposed to careening headlong into action . We do not confuse activity with productivity . * Initiatives are not frequently thrown off course by external or internal events and circumstances that should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our projects . For example , each time we develop a product or install an information technology system , we draw on the valuable lessons from previous initiatives of this type . Do we monitor and report on initiative performance effectively and efficiently ? * I and my colleagues on the executive team know how many projects are underway and how much of our human and financial resources they are consuming . * The executive team is sufficiently close to initiative progress . Project status information readily is available . * We know , early on , if projects are failing to achieve their objectives or are coming in late and over budget . * Project status reporting focuses on giving executives the facts that they need to make midcourse corrections rather than on complaining , anatomy protection , and blame-fixing . Once you have completed your self-diagnosis , pass the questions to others in your organization-senior executives as well as those with project management responsibility . Their responses will indicate whether your strategy will remain just that , or make a real difference to your organization 's future .
