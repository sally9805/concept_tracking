PROLOGUE 1863 It was Belinda 's favorite time of year , the three or four weeks of early spring when winter was transformed into something else , some halfway season that smelled of percolating earth and trickling streams . The grass was still brown and sickly-looking from the long winter , but when she bent her head to inhale the wet scent of the ground , she could see a fur of pale green growth below that promised a stronger green , could feel the hesitant sun that whispered its promise in the cool air . She was on her way to her family grave plot on Asphodel Path , in one of the newest sections of Mount Auburn Cemetery . They were expanding the cemetery and she was aware of the movements of the workers as they carted soil to build more new roads . On the weekend there had been visitors thronging the little avenues-it was the custom now to come for a stroll among the headstones , seeking respite from the busy city , from news of sons and brothers and sweethearts killed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the workers laughing together as she 'd arrived the first day , they seemed to be trying to respect her privacy now . She had come nearly every day since he had died . And she had found that she had begun to look forward to her trips to Mount Auburn , the only time of day when she was really alone . She liked wandering along the little lanes and reading the stones . There was one that she found herself walking by nearly every time she went , a simple white marble likeness of an angel with the words , " My wife and child . " The ground had not thawed sufficiently for burial and it would be months before Charles 's monumentwould be ready , but she had been trying to tend to the plot with a dull little pair of sewing scissors , eventually giving up and using her fingers to pull up the dead weeds and grass by their barren roots . Belinda smoothed the necklace that she wore at her throat , made of hair carefully braided into a chain . Charles had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auburn , and it had n't grayed much at all , even during his long illness . It had grown out in those last months-he had had a strange superstition about cutting it-and by working the locks of hair around a mold to make twenty intricately netted balls and then stringing them together , she had been able to make a necklace that reached the third button of her dress . After preparing the locks of hair with soda water according to the instructions in Godey 's Lady 's Book , she had sat alone in the parlor night after night with the strange little hairwork table that the gardener had made for her . When she was finished , she had taken the necklace to her father 's jeweler , who had put on the clasp . The pursuit had pleased her ; it had been something to do during those strange evenings when if she did n't miss him exactly , she missed the bulk of him across the dinner table or in the parlor , where he had always sat with the paper , drinking port while she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head to clear away the image of his sickbed , the stained rags littering the floor , the housemaid scurrying around nervously , crossing herself as his time neared . It was funny how she had become attuned to his condition in those last few days , and she had known he was going to die before the doctor knew . His color , and the way the room smelled , had told her that she would soon be a widow . " I 'm sorry , ma'am , I have to bring a load of earth by and I would n't want to be disturbing you , ma'am . " She started and turned to find one of the laborers behind her , standing with a cart . Irish . She stepped back . " That 's all right . Go ahead . It wo n't bother me , " she said , looking into a pair of blue eyes , a boyish face . He was n't very old . Not much older than she was . Twenty-three , she said to herself . I am only twenty-three and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault , what had happened . She had married a man as old as her father because she had wanted an easy life . She had been just a girl , prone to daydreaming . She had liked to sketch . That was how she had known he had an interest in her . They had met in Newport , at the Ocean House , where her father liked to go for the sea air . She had been sketching in the music room of the hotel one evening and he had wandered in . Her father knew him through business and they had spoken the evening before . When he came in , holding a newspaper and looking uncomfortable , she had had the idea to sketch him in his discomfort and had asked his permission . He had smiled as though it surprised him and agreed , and it was n't until later that she had looked at the sketch and seen something in his face that made her stomach knot . That night she had played cards with him and chatted flirtatiously . She felt somehow that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own actions she was ashamed . The next day she had agreed to stroll along the cliffs with him . When they were back in Boston , her father had asked her to come into the library and he had told her about the proposal . " He is aware that the age difference is a problem , " he told her , stammering a little . " It is up to you . I admit that I always thought of you marrying for love , someone who could match your high spirits . I wish that your mother were still alive to talk to you about the demands of marriage , about the difficulties in living with another person . But he is a good man and I do n't have to tell you that we have been hard hit in the markets . It wo n't be many months before we have to sell this house . It 's up to you to decide how you want to live . " She had told him she would think about it , but she had known , even as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was her own fault . God would punish her . She knew this now . God would punish her for her thoughts and . . . for her actions . She had not been a good Christian wife to him . She sat down on the grass , feeling the dampness soaking through the wool of her dress . The cold shocked her skin . But the dress was dark and the stain would not show . She smiled a little at this . No , she had not been a good Christian wife to him at all . Still . . . if she was truthful with herself , she had never felt so free . ONE The first thing Becca Dearborne noticed was Brad 's angelfish . It had flipped onto its side , its eyes staring into the bubbling water , its catlike whiskers trailing . The other fish-a few more angels , a swarm of tiny , flashing tetras , a grumpy catfish-swam around nervously , as though they knew something was wrong . She extracted a little green net from the jumble of supplies next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thermometers , a pair of rubber gloves , then scooped out the dead fish and took it through to the bathroom , where she flushed it down the toilet and rinsed out the net . " It must have died in the night , " she said softly to Jaybee . " Otherwise , he 'd never have left it there . " She put a finger to the glass and felt something in her stomach , a pang , of sadness perhaps , for the fish . " Yeah . He 'd probably have taken it to the hospital . " Jaybee , who had been Brad 's friend since ninth grade and his roommate since their freshman year of college , liked to make fun of Brad 's obsession with the aquarium . He spent a fortune buying special plants and various concoctions that were supposed to kill bad bacteria or add good bacteria , or change the pH of the water . And he spent hours testing the water and taking notes on how various changes affected the health of the fish . Becca , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood . She could stare into the depths of the aquarium for minutes on end , mesmerized by the movements of the fish in the water , lazy one moment , quick the next . " I 'm taking a shower , " she said . Jaybee reached for her arm and pulled her toward him , kissing her long and hard . Dizzy , she pulled away and escaped into the bathroom . Under the hot spray of water she arched her neck , soaping her hair and body and feeling the tightly knotted muscles along her shoulders give way . It felt so good that she turned the tap toward hot until she could feel her nerves scream and stood under the scalding spray for a few seconds before twisting the handle to off . Drip , drop , came the final water from the tap . Becca wrapped herself in a bath towel , and wiped a little window in the steam on the mirror . Her face seemed blurry to her , her eyes too big , the whites cloudy , the color of weak tea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she looked the same and she turned away from the mirror , going out into the living room where Jaybee was standing in the middle of the area rug-a castoff from his older brother 's apartment-looking perplexed . " What 's the matter ? " she whispered , coming up behind him and pressing her body against his . Jaybee-his long back , his grin , his soft , auburny hair , his right index finger , bent from a childhood accident with a car door-made her feel somehow at a loss . She felt displaced , almost sick when she was with him , a completely new experience . The three other sexual relationships she 'd had in her twenty years-with her boarding school boyfriend and two casual college flings-had seemed a sort of kindly , benign prostitution . By sleeping with those boys , for they were boys , she had secured companionship , affection , dates for important events , and presents on her birthday . It had seemed , in each case , a worthwhile exchange . But this was something else . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone outside for some air , he told her when he came back to bed-and she had experienced the most profound panic she had ever experienced . She had felt that she would do anything to feel his back against her arms again as she did now . " I do n't know , " Jaybee said , looking around the room . " The apartment looks different . Weird . " Becca looked around too . Due to Jaybee 's influence , the apartment was usually messy . There were books piled on every surface , dirty dishes in the sink , bikes and helmets tumbled on the floor behind the black couch . But he was right : there was something different about the room . All of the kitchen cabinets were open , as were the doors of the entertainment center in the living room . There was a jumbled pile of tools and videotapes and odds and ends on the floor beneath the television stand . The room smelled of vomit . Becca felt cold all of a sudden . " He was really drunk , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yeah . " Jaybee tried to smile . " That 's right . He was pretty trashed , was n't he ? " " I 'm going to get dressed . " She walked past Brad 's closed door and into Jaybee 's room , where she hurriedly put on her clothes , toweling her hair for a second and then going back out into the living room . Jaybee was standing in front of Brad 's door . " You going to check on him ? " She was making a conscious effort to stay calm , though she knew something was wrong . Later , she would wonder if it was Jaybee 's pale , terrified face or something less tangible that had made her so afraid . Jaybee did n't say anything . He just put a hand on Brad 's doorknob and turned it , hesitating a few minutes before pushing the door open . " Brad ? " Over his shoulder , she saw the gravestone photographs that Brad had all over his walls . The black-and-white images seemed to crowd the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her own head as she followed Jaybee in and saw Brad , lying there on the bed . " Jesus ! " Jaybee whispered . " Jesus ! "
