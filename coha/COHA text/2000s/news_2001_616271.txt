<p> Pam Boas remembers the phone call she received on the night her race-driving son won his first major USAC race . He had driven aggressively , but he was n't boasting about the victory or his driving exploits . <p> Instead , he was concerned about other things . <p> " He was hurt that he had gotten booed , " Boas said . " He had never been booed before , even when he was running go-karts . " <p> Boas said her son is a kind-hearted person , who takes criticism hard and goes out of his way to please the people around him . When he gets in trouble , it 's mostly because he puts winning above everything else and says what 's on his mind without weighing the consequences . <p> Of course , there are a lot of people who believe otherwise , especially after last week 's race at Daytona International Speedway . <p> That 's because Pam Boas ' son is Tony Stewart . <p> In just 2 1/2 seasons on the Winston Cup circuit , Tony Stewart has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all of motorsports . <p> In only 85 career Winston Cup starts , he has 11 victories , 30 top-5 and 53 top-10 finishes . He won a record three races as a rookie in 1999 , then led the circuit with six victories in 2000 . In his 2 1/2 years in the Indy Racing League , he won the 1997 season championship , three races and seven poles , including one in the Indy 500 . <p> But he also leads the league in flare-ups , confrontations and probations . <p> On Wednesday , NASCAR fined Stewart and extended a probation until the end of the season for going face to face with officials after the race . <p> Stewart already was on probation for ramming Jeff Gordon 's car into the wall after a race at Bristol . <p> Stewart 's family and friends say it 's sad that most of the public never gets to know the real Tony Stewart . They talk endlessly about his love for children and animals , and every one has a story of Stewart 's generosity . <p> And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her son has an outburst such as the one after the Pepsi 400 at Daytona last Saturday , he does n't deserve the skewering he gets . <p> " He 's just being outspoken , but I 'm not sure that 's always so wrong , " Boas said . " He does n't mean to be hateful ; he just says things like he feels them . A.J. Foyt always got in trouble for that , and he still does . " <p> Stewart admits he overreacted Saturday , but he does n't believe he 's any different than the average person . <p> " If you did n't get mad every once in a while , that would n't be too good , " he said . " You 've got a right to be upset when a decision you disagree with cost you a chance to win a race and a million dollars and a big gain in the points race . <p> " If you 're not upset by that , then you 're too good a loser . It shows you do n't care , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? ' " <p> That emphasis on winning seems to have come from his genes and upbringing . <p> Boas , who divorced Stewart 's father , Nelson , after their kids were grown , said that when Tony and his sister Natalie were toddlers , she often played games with them . When the kids were really young , she did things to help them win , to give them a taste of victory . But soon the gloves were off , and it was every Stewart for himself . <p> One of the family 's favorite video games was Donkey Kong , where the first contestant continues playing until making a mistake . In the Stewart family , everyone played for keeps . <p> " Tony would get me to sit down and play , and he 'd go first , and an hour later I 'd be sitting there waiting my turn , " Boas said . " Well one night I put the kids to bed early and I sat there on the floor all by myself and practiced for four hours so the next time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to sit there and wait and wait . " <p> The fire came from Nelson , who said teaching his son political correctness was n't his style . <p> " I 've always told Tony to stand up for what he thought was right , " Nelson said . " If you give an answer , give an honest one . If you 're not going to give an honest answer , do n't give them a line of bull . Either tell the truth or do n't say anything . That 's the way we always went to the races in the early stages of his racing , and that 's what he 's doing now . " <p> Tony says he has no desire to try to change his personality . But he knows it 's becoming increasingly hard in today 's Winston Cup world for drivers to let their true selves show and to say what they really think . <p> " When you try to ( be yourself ) , it usually goes against you , " he said . " I 've spent a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drivers , and they 're different people in the bus lot than they are in the garage area . They 're really interesting people and they have neat personalities . It 's a shame people do n't get to see who these people really are away from the garage area . " <p> The family does n't want to see Tony change , either , despite his periodic controversies , such as when he rammed Gordon and threw a shoe plate at Kenny Irwin at Martinsville the year before . <p> Boas said her son never will be another Jeff Gordon , the driver Stewart would rather beat more than any other . <p> " Jeff was programmed from the start about how to be tactful and to say the right things at the right time , but that 's not Tony , " she said . " We taught him to be honest and to be a good sport , and when other people are n't , that 's when his frustration shows . <p> " Sometimes he 'll say things in a moment of frustration , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he 's so very open and so out front that it 's hard for him to hold some of those things back and think about them before he says them . " <p> Irish Saunders , an official with Hoosier Tire Company who worked with both Stewart and Gordon early in their careers , said Gordon has managed to stay out of trouble because his step-father , John Bickford , guided his career on and off the track . <p> " John Bickford was a lot of Jeff Gordon 's success , " he said . " John always made sure that Jeff always was politically right in what he said , that he walked the walk and talked the talk . John kept him in the best equipment and groomed him , and that 's why he 's where he is today . <p> " It was n't that way with Tony . " <p> Tony Stewart said drivers , crew members and others came up to him when he arrived at Chicagoland Speedway on Thursday to pat him on the back and voice support . <p> " Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep my head up , " he said . <p> It meant a lot to Stewart . It had been a rough week . <p> Stewart said his frustrations last weekend were compounded by the fact that the series was racing at Daytona for the first time since Dale Earnhardt died . And with the current body rules and a change in the suspension rules , his Pontiac was hard to handle . <p> " It was hard enough just to go back where it all happened , " he said . " Then during practice I just could n't drive my car . I knew going into the race that I was probably going to get wrecked . " <p> So Stewart and his teammate , Bobby Labonte , rode in the back of the pack until the very end when they made a bid for the victory . That 's when Stewart drove below the yellow line to avoid Johnny Benson 's Pontiac and drew NASCAR 's infamous black flag . <p> " If I had held my line there would have been a 20-car wreck , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " But I would not do that . That 's not me . " <p> He said he thought NASCAR should have reconsidered its decision to black-flag him , which cost him 20 positions in the finishing order , and he would n't have considered that a special favor . <p> " I 've never asked for anything I do n't deserve , " he said . " I want to earn everything I get , but I do n't want anything taken away from me , either . " <p> After the race , a fuming Stewart knocked a tape recorder from the hand of reporter Mike Mulhern and shouted at Winston Cup director Gary Nelson . For those outbursts he was fined $10,000 , placed on probation and told to apologize to Mulhern and Nelson . <p> Times like Saturday night are when Pam Boas winces at the sight of her son erupting like a Roman candle . <p> " Sometimes as a mother I 'm saying , ' Tony , please , ca n't you rephrase that and say it in a little different manner that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Boas and most of Stewart 's friends said his fierce competitive nature make it hard for him to be happy unless he 's winning . <p> " His whole goal when he gets on that track is to win and nothing less than that , " she said . " A real race driver would n't want it any other way . " <p> Saunders , who has known Stewart for more than 20 years , said he was n't too surprised by Stewart 's outburst after he was black-flagged . <p> " I know what a fierce competitor he is , and in my eyes , he did nothing wrong ( in the race ) , " Saunders said . " I know how frustrated he gets . " <p> Nelson Stewart said his son never had a problem controlling his temper until he reached the Winston Cup level . <p> " There 's a lot of pressure from all directions there , and 90 percent of it is uncalled for , " he said . " It was n't like that when he ran open-wheel cars , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> But even when his son has an outburst , he quickly regrets it , Nelson said . <p> " Once he calms down he wishes he had n't said or done a lot of things , just like all of us , " he said . " In the heat of the moment you say and do things you do n't mean a lot of times . But he 's such a high-profile person everybody jumps on him . " <p> Tony Stewart apologized to those involved and promised to work on his behavior . <p> " The thing I really regret about Saturday night is Mulhern 's deal , " Stewart said . " Mike is usually one of the ones that understands the emotions of the moment and gives me a few minutes , but it was a night race , and everybody has early deadlines . We talked about it ( Thursday ) , and we both have a better understanding of where the other is coming from . " <p> Dick Sullivan , a senior vice president at Home Depot , said Stewart does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a mistake . <p> " Tony beats himself up pretty good , " Sullivan said , adding that it is important to Home Depot for Stewart to keep his cool . <p> " We 're excited about his spirit and his passion on the track , but we do have concerns about what he does off the track , " he said . <p> But overall , Sullivan and Home Depot are extremely happy with their driver . " He told us when we first talked that all he wanted to do was have fun , " Sullivan said . " I knew from the beginning it would be a great relationship . " <p> Stewart said the pressure he feels is mostly the result of stories written by a handful of reporters . <p> " Home Depot has never put any pressure on me , and ( team owner ) Joe Gibbs has never put any pressure on me from that standpoint , " he said . " For a lot of drivers , the pressure is sponsor-driven , but in my case it 's more from the media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly , but that 10th person knows it 's going to be a big story if they can catch you at a bad time . " <p> And he said that while a shouting match in other sports gets little attention , it 's no longer that way in NASCAR . <p> " If you get two drivers in an argument at a Winston Cup race , it turns the world upside down , " he said . <p> Some people say that Tony Stewart is becoming increasingly unhappy in Winston Cup and might one day go back to running open-wheel cars on dirt tracks and in the Indy Racing League . But that is n't likely to happen , according to Stewart and the people who know him best . <p> " It 's been a great career , " Tony said . " I 've raced for 23 years in 42 states . I 've raced for an NFL Super Bowl-winning coach . I 've driven a Silver Crown car for A.J. Foyt . I 've done a lot of things I would n't have been able to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family have worked too hard to leave Winston Cup competition . <p> " When I was 12 years old , my parents mortgaged the house so we could have enough money to go racing , " he said . " We all sacrificed . I 've worked all my life and given up a lot of things in life to do what I do . <p> " I did n't go to parties in high school . I did n't go out drinking with my buddies when I turned 21 . I was focused on racing . I 've always been focused on my racing . and whether you like me or dislike me , at least respect what I 'm doing . " <p> And , his friends say , Stewart eventually will find ways to avoid bad publicity . They say that is something no sponsor or car owner can do for him . <p> " Tony 's a big boy , and he has to do it on his own , " Saunders said .
