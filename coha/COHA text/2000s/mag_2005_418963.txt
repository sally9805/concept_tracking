The groom drove a pickup truck ; the bride machine-tooled his ring . ( Ah , love ! ) Sandra Bullock and her biker beau , Jesse James , floored guests at their barbecue bash when they said " I do " - their way // The bride wore white . And there were flowers everywhere . But the fact that they were flowing out of old barnwood troughs-and that the bride wore cowboy boots under her silk tulle Angel Sanchez dress-was a clue that the wedding of Sandra Bullock and Jesse James was not going to be a traditional affair . For starters-until a half an hour before the evening ceremony at a ranch in Solvang , Calif. , on July 16-almost none of the guests were sure they 'd been invited to a wedding . They RSVP 'd instead to a barbeque " in honor of Sandy B. given with love by Jesse J. , " as the invite read , to celebrate Bullock 's 41st birthday on July 26 . In the requested " evening cocktail attire " on Bullock 's side were old pals from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( where her mother was born ) and a handful of celeb buddies including Hugh Grant , Keanu Reeves , William Shatner and Regina King . On the side of the groom-who owns West Coast Choppers custom bike shop in Long Beach , Calif. - were family members and a few Hell 's Angels buddies in suits and tattoos . How did everyone find out their hosts were cooking up more than ribs ? From a ? ? - minute video they watched over cocktails featuring the couple talking cute about each other and ending with James-a lover of pit bulls and pet sharks and the guns he occasionally uses to shoot at cars on his show Monster Garage-sharing their joyous news . As he put it , " We 've been engaged since October , suckers ! " And so as the sun set and lanterns sparkled from the branches of a huge old tree overhead , 270 delighted suckers plopped down on horse blankets and hay bales in a grove on a private estate 38 miles from Santa Barbara and watched as Sandy and Jesse wed . " She was gorgeous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Bullock 's sister Gesine Bullock-Prado . " It was nice for it all to finally happen . " The key word in that sentence : Finally . Never one to nurse childhood fantasies about cascading flowers and a puffy white gown , Bullock until recently found the very idea of marriage off-putting . As she told PEOPLE in March , " When people talk about marriage , inevitably it 's about the dress , the cake , the shoes , the honeymoon , the people who are going to be there ... It just was n't for me . " Her sense of caution , and privacy , was evident even after her unlikely romance with tough-guy James , 36-whom she met in 2003 while taking her nephew on a tour of the Long Beach set of Garage , his hit vehicle-makeover show on the Discovery Channel-became serious . Several months ago , she began wearing the vintage engagement ring-a 1910 Tiffany and Co. piece from jeweler Neil Lane 's private collection-that James gave her on her left index finger . And the invitations she sent out about two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the M-word . As she said about the whole " Hallmark thing " in March , " People were trying to put me on their schedule . I 've got my own schedule . " One she kept closely guarded until men in kilts playing bagpipes lured guests from a tent to the wooded grove around 8 p.m . The invitations they had received asked them to board shuttle buses in Santa Barbara to an unspecified location at about 5 p.m . Though most had heard rumors a wedding might take place , only a few there knew for sure . Among them : Bullock 's father , John , 70 , a vocal coach from Arlington , and Gesine , 35 , who runs a bakery out of Montpelier , Vt. , and made the fourtier wedding cake topped with a bride and groom on a bicycle . Almost everyone else spent the first two hours sitting at burlap- and lace-covered tables under the tent or poolside by a Colonial-style manor , nibbling on hors d'oeuvres and scratching their heads . Says one guest : " To the last minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is she not getting married ? Is she getting married ? Is she not getting married ? ' " Not that the suspense was the evening 's only excitement . As guests were boarding buses in Santa Barbara , James was already making his grand entrance at the ranch ; he drove up in a red double-cab truck , tires squealing and engine revving . On the narrow roadway outside the ranch , he hit a speed bump that sent his truck flying briefly into the air . And moments later , inside the property , he turned a sharp corner so hard that he skidded out in the dirt road . But by around 8 p.m. he was back on track , waiting for his bride at the end of a path strewn with rose petals . First came Bullock 's mixedbreed dogs , Kernie and Bob , dressed up in collars woven with natural grasses . " They were just so excited to be there , like everybody else was , " says a guest . Then came Gesine , Bullock 's maid of honor . Without any formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just " all glommed together " near James . As Bullock walked down the aisle on the arm of her father , the recorded sounds of an aria from Bellini 's Norma , sung by her mother , Helga , a Germanborn opera singer who died of cancer in 2000 , filled the air . " Nobody said it was her , so you kind of had to know , " says a guest . " It was really touching , like her mom was there . " Moments later the aria ended and Bullock joined James beneath an old tree hung with a cameo that had belonged to her mother . The grove was so silent , says her sister , " we could hear the birds . " The quiet did n't last long . At first there was the sound of guests crying , both from the emotion of her mother 's aria and from the sight of Sandy as a bride . Says one guest : " She never thought she was going to get married . She 's waited a long time . " Next came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and James exchanged personal remarks . " They were kind of humorous , " says the guest . " He wanted her to promise that he could bring home dogs that he found . And she wanted him to promise not to bring home any dogs until she okayed it . " As the audience cracked up , Bullock looked at her groom and , says a guest , " looked absolutely gorgeous . The exchange of vows was very much their own . It was very beautiful and very sweet . " Says pal and florist Cecelia Heffernan : " She was totally relaxed and just so excited to marry him . There was no second-guessing about anything . Those two just wanted to be together . " During the 20-minute ceremony , the bride and groom exchanged bands . Hers was custom-made from platinum by Neil Lane according to James 's design , with intricate beadwork to match her engagement ring ; his was hand-tooled out of stainless steel by Bullock herself . After they officially became husband and wife , everyone applauded . Then , says Gesine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First the newlyweds danced to a remix of the Motown classic " Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me . " ( Bullock 's song to James , says a source ; his to her is Ray Charles 's " Hallelujah , I Love Her So . " ) Inside a large tent , lights covered with amber shading , chandeliers hanging from the top , and sheer fabric draped from the poles gave the feel of an old saloon-one filled with the bluegrass punk-rock sounds of the Los Angeles-based band the Cousin Lovers . In keeping with the western hoedown theme , guests made their way around hay bales to a buffet that included fried chicken , shrimp gumbo and mac and cheese . " The whole tent was very fun , very lively . People could actually sit on the hay bales and watch people dance , " says Heffernan . And dance they did . After dinner , revelers grooved to dance music from deejay Tony Okungbowa , who is best-known for spinning on The Ellen DeGeneres Show . " It was a lot of fun , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eclectic crowd . It really brought together his world and hers . " From now on , those worlds will be joined : the bubble baths and chocolate peanut butter ice cream she loves , the choppers and drag races he loves , the Starbucks runs and strolls with the dogs that suit them both . As the last guests reboarded shuttles near dawn , Bullock and James were looking forward to their future : for starters , a trip to Las Vegas ( see box ) and after that , a shared life they manage despite their differences . " They just let each other be themselves . One 's not trying to conform to the other 's lifestyle , " says Regina King , Bullock 's pal and costar in Miss Congeniality 2 : Armed and Fabulous . The wedding , she adds , reflected the couple : " Nice and relaxed-they just kind of made this perfect union .

" Sanchez was less happy when Bullock told him she wanted to wear it with custom satin cowboy boots . But she won him over . " They were so beautiful , " says Warren , " it worked . " Sidebar THE RINGS Months ago Bullock began wearing her vintage engagement ring-a 1910 Tiffany and Co. piece from jeweler Neil Lane 's private collection-on her index finger . The setting of the two square diamonds symbolizes " two people in union , " says Lane , who also made Bullock 's wedding band . " We 've been engaged since October , suckers !

They laughed and , after she cleaned up with a napkin , got back to business . Says an observer : " They could n't keep their hands off each other .

" A distant relative of the infamous outlaw , James , 36 , hails from Long Beach , Calif. , the son of a used-furniture-dealer father and a florist mother . He spent time in a juvenile-detention facility due , he has said , to his " fondness for other people 's stuff " - and learned right from wrong " the hard way . " Despite the gruff and extravagantly tattooed exterior , James-who has two young children with ex-wife Karla James and one with ex-wife Janine Lindemulder-is , like his new bride , somewhat publicity shy and prefers drag races to red carpets .
