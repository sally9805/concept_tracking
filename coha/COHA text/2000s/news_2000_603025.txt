<p> DELRAY BEACH , Fla.  --  When she was young , Louise Suggs fought on the front lines to legitimize the idea of women as athletes . Now at 77 she is content living in a three-story condominium on the banks of the Intracoastal Waterway . Her home is in a gated community , where the security is constant and the serenity interrupted only by the rumbling of huge pleasure boats and the high-pitched whine of jet skis . <p> Suggs has been here 25 years , quietly moving into the twilight of her life . But this year , Suggs and seven other living founders of the LPGA jump back into the spotlight as the tour celebrates its 50th anniversary . <p> They survived through times of little money , arduous travel and little staff support . <p> " I 'm just glad I lived long enough to see this anniversary , " Suggs says . " We were a pretty gutsy bunch . We were so dumb that we did n't know we could n't succeed . I think we survived in spite of ourselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization but played with Bobby Jones , won an argument with Ben Hogan and ended her pro career over a $ 25 disagreement . In between she won 55 tournaments from 1948-62 . This year the LPGA 's rookie of the year receives the Louise Suggs Trophy , and Suggs has given the organization $ 500,000 to promote junior golf . <p> Celebrating all year <p> The LPGA kicked off its year-long celebration Monday with a Night of Champions Dinner at The Breakers in Palm Beach , Fla . The tour begins its season today with The Office Depot tournament at Ibis Golf &; Country Club in West Palm Beach . <p> There will be other celebrations throughout the year , but this one is special . It began at Suggs ' home with a party Sunday night and continued with the black-tie dinner hosted by Grammy Award-winning country singer Vince Gill . <p> LPGA stars past and present were there to honor the founders who were " dumb " enough to think they could be pioneers . <p> " We ought to thank our lucky stars that we had Louise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Beth Daniel , a Hall of Fame player . " We know what women 's professional golf would have been without Louise and the others . I think we would have had a tour , but I do n't we would have gotten started until the mid-1970s . And we certainly would n't be as secure as we are today . " <p> Not that there was great security among the founders . They all shared a common goal but not all shared a friendship . <p> The 13 founders were strong-willed , competitive women . Suggs was quiet but determined . Babe Zaharias , an Olympian before she took up golf , was loud and determined to be the tour 's star . <p> " Babe and I got along , " Suggs says , " but we were not the best of friends . " <p> Suggs never said much about her conflict with Zaharias for fear it would be seen as sour grapes . " Does anyone ever like everyone they meet ? " <p> While Zaharias had three Olympic medals to quantify her athletic ability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , John , was a left-handed pitcher for the Atlanta Crackers of the old Southern Association . Her mother , Marguerite , was the daughter of the Crackers ' team owner . <p> John Suggs pitched for the Crackers from 1919-23 , and he went to spring training with the New York Yankees but failed to gain a spot on a roster that included Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig . <p> His years with the Crackers did lead him into golf in a backward way . " In his day if a pitcher hit a home run in the Southern Association , he got a set of golf clubs , " Suggs explains . " My father hit one home run , he got the clubs and that 's how he got into golf . " <p> After baseball , Suggs managed a golf course in Lithia Springs , Ga. , and spent his extra time teaching Louise to play the game . At 14 , she won the Georgia State Amateur ; she won the British Amateur at 24 . <p> ' Mr. Jones ' and ' Mr. Hogan ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hogan and never let herself be overwhelmed or intimidated . <p> " Mr. Jones was a fine gentleman , " Suggs says of the man who won golf 's Grand Slam and then founded Augusta ( Ga . ) National and The Masters . " No matter how long he had known you , he 'd always reintroduce himself by saying , ' Hello , I 'm Bobby Jones . ' " <p> Suggs recalls Jones ' shot-making ability as equal to any player 's . " I asked him how to hit a ball around a tree , " she recalls . " He took four golf balls , hit the first over the tree and second under the tree . Then he faded the third around the tree and finished by drawing the fourth around the tree . " <p> Her first experience as Hogan 's teammate was n't as pleasant . It was in 1945 in a two-day Victory Tournament in Chicago . In the first round she beat Hogan by a stroke for nine holes . The next day Hogan did n't even speak to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think you 're a gentleman . I 'm up here helping you win the tournament , and you wo n't even speak to me , ' " Suggs recalls . <p> Hogan later accepted her and wrote glowing remarks about her game . But , Suggs says , " He won the money , and I won the money clip . " <p> As an amateur , Suggs made a living by working for Gulf Oil in Atlanta . She did promotions and had all the free time she needed to play golf . But she grew tired of competing for money clips and no money and joined the 13 players who founded the LPGA . <p> " Certainly , she was one of the top five players , " says Betsy Rawls , who joined the LPGA in 1951 . " Babe was a better athlete , but Louise was a better golfer . " <p> Suggs won the ' 49 Women 's Open by 14 strokes , then won nine times in ' 53 and five in ' 54 . <p> " I do n't think Louise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 71 . " She contributed to our organization as a player and a president . " <p> Suggs won each of the LPGA 's major championships during her best years . But by 1962 , she turned away from the tour and became more of a teaching pro than touring pro . Rawls said she left after being fined for not showing up at a tournament . <p> " Any of us would have paid the $ 25 , " says Rawls , who was the LPGA 's president . " But Louise is a woman of principle . She thought she should n't have been fined . She did n't play much after that , and I think she would have won a lot of tournaments if she had . " <p> In 1990 , Charlie Mechem , a retired broadcast executive , became the tour 's commissioner and made a point of welcoming Suggs back into the association . <p> " I 'd never met Charlie Mechem when he called me , " Suggs says . " He says , ' I want to pick your brain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first commissioner who really talked to me and wanted to know what I thought . " <p> In the last decade , Suggs seems to have recognized that she is admired for the success she enjoyed and loved by many of her former students . <p> " When you go through life , you do n't know how difficult things are at the time , " Suggs says . " I would n't trade my experiences for anything , but I do n't know that I 'd want to go through them again .
