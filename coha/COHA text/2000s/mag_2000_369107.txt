The setting : any airport , U.S.A. The victims : you and your laptop . Action ! You put your computer on the X-ray conveyor belt and get in line for the metal detector . The guy in front of you gets stopped and has to empty his pockets . Turns out he 's a walking scrap heap , and it takes him five minutes to get through . Meanwhile , your defenseless laptop is waiting helplessly on the other side . By the time you 're finally through , it 's gone  --  swiped by Scrap Heap 's accomplice on the other side . <P> Pretty clever , huh ? It 's a classic con , and it just goes to show that your precious hardware is at its most vulnerable when you 're on the road . When I travel , I usually take one of TIME 's computers with me , so if it gets dropped or ripped off , hey , no big deal ( just kidding , boss ! ) . When I have my own laptop with me , however , safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assuming nobody tries to steal it ( you can always hand your laptop to an attendant while you walk through first ) , and assuming you 're not checking it ( never , ever check your laptop ) , one thing you do n't have to worry about is the X-ray machine . It 's safe . The FAA swears by it on a stack of PowerBooks . Metal detectors are also safe , by the way , although if you try to take your laptop through , you will probably be pulled aside and subjected to the Wand of Shame . <P> Theft is a more serious problem . According to the Computer Security Institute , which works with the FBI to compile statistics on computer-related crimes , laptop theft has almost doubled since 1998 , and hotels and airports are major danger spots . If you plan on leaving your computer alone in a hotel room , you will want to invest in a laptop lock . Most laptops come with a security slot in the back  --  it 's that tiny hole with a padlock symbol next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with  --  and the lock snaps right into it . Loop the other end around a fixed object , and you 're golden . Laptop locks are all pretty much the same , but Kryptonite makes the one with the thickest cable , the 8-mm Mega Key Cable Lock ( $49 ) . A company called Kensington also makes a cable lock for Palms , but it 's a little cumbersome for anybody but severe kleptophobes . <P> For when you 're in an airport , several companies make fancy motion-sensor alarms that beep distressingly if someone tries to walk off with your machine ( for example , while you 're in a phone booth ) . The winner here is the Defcon 3 ( $129 ) , a laptop case from Targus that has a motion alarm built in . As a Targus representative puts it , the Defcon 3 is " a sexy unit " ; no less studly a geek than Harry Connick Jr . carries one . <P> No matter how sexy your unit , make sure before you leave home that your homeowner 's or renter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . If yours does n't , there are several firms that specialize in insurance policies specifically for computers . Safeware
