Steven Soderbergh wants you to see movies the way he sees movies . When he and his cinematographer finish a film , they lift it out of its chemical bath and take it to a projection booth for its first and most perfect screening . The color and contrast are true and bright from edge to edge , free of dust and precisely in focus . " Nobody , including us , ever sees it that good again , " says Soderbergh , the Oscar-winning director of Traffic and Erin Brockovich . " Even after that first screening , it 's got dirt on it and scratches . " It 's one of the sad facts of life for anyone who loves movies : film wears out and runs at the mercy of projectors with weak lamps and worn gears . <P> It does n't have to be this way . The latest digital-projection systems , which run from digital-data files rather than reels of film , can deliver images as sharp and rich as the best film print , without ever degrading . After viewing a demonstration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Soderbergh says , " I thought , ' Why do n't we have this everywhere ? ' It 's like seeing a pristine camera negative print every time . " The quality of digital projection  --  which works for movies shot on film and later converted , as well as for digital or computer-generated movies  --  is no secret . Soderbergh released Ocean 's Eleven digitally wherever projectors were available . George Lucas is promoting digital projection as the best way to view his latest Star Wars movie , Episode II : Attack of the Clones . Even the Academy Awards ceremony used digital projectors this year for its film clips . <P> But today fewer than 30 of the 35,000 movie screens in the U.S.  --  and 25 of the 75,000 screens abroad  --  run digital projectors . And so far , all those projectors house TI 's DLP chip , which consists of an array of tiny mirrors that flip on and off , refracting light through a prism and onto the screen . Kodak is developing a competing product set to launch next year . Its chip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mirrors and , in a recent demonstration , appeared to match DLP 's in quality . " The holdup right now is not the technology  --  it 's the economics , " says Elizabeth Daley , dean of the film school at the University of Southern California . The major movie studios and theater owners are tangled in a web of competing interests that is delaying adoption of digital technology  --  and preventing the industry from achieving hundreds of millions of dollars in annual savings . <P> Installing a new digital-projection system , which includes a server for storing the files and a PC for running the screening software , costs about $120,000 a screen , although the price could fall significantly as volume picks up . Even so , that sort of expense makes little sense to the operator of the local sixplex , which usually owns the projection equipment . Nick Mulone , who owns four theaters in the Pittsburgh , Pa. , area , praises digital-picture quality but does n't expect it to draw crowds or justify higher ticket prices .
