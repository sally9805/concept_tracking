Grizzled old jocks sitting around the training room comparing war stories and showing off battle scars are as familiar in organized sports as jockstraps and body odor . Today , however , with female sports participation at an all-time high ( 2.5 million high school girls and 145,000 college women will compete this year ) , the athletes telling war stories are more likely to have smooth faces and wear sports bras . The injuries have also changed . One in particular has sports doctors worried . <P> It 's a knee injury  --  damage to the anterior cruciate ligament , or ACL . As increasing numbers of young women lace up their cleats and head out onto the field , more are showing up in infirmaries and operating rooms with a partly torn or completely ruptured ACL . This is a lot more serious than an ankle sprain or a jammed finger . The ACL is the knee 's most important stabilizer and if severely injured can require surgical repair and cause permanent , perhaps career-ending damage . <P> Several studies have shown that women are considerably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimates , they suffer this injury two to eight times as frequently as men . For years , doctors thought this had something to do with weakness in the joints and ligaments . The evidence , however , does n't support the notion . What research has shown is that there are inherent anatomical differences between male and female athletes  --  differences in pelvic width and alignment of the leg bones  --  that make women more likely to injure their ACL . Unfortunately , these anatomical features ca n't be modified . <P> But if you are a female athlete , you do n't have to take knee problems as a given . There are several things you can do to reduce your risk of ACL injury . One is strength training . The muscles around the knee  --  in particular the quadriceps ( front leg muscles ) and hamstrings ( back leg muscles )  --  play a critical role in keeping the knee stable during athletic performance . Strength in the hamstrings has been shown to protect the ACL from excessive strain ; women , however , tend to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Research has also shown that women jump and land differently than men do . This is critical because a high percentage of ACL injuries occur during these moves . Women are less flexible in the hip and knee joints and tend to land in a position of extension rather than the preferable flexed position . Special jump training involving wall jumps and single-leg hops strengthens leg muscles and can create more favorable body mechanics . <P> Finally , women can protect their knees by improving their balance . This can be done by building up the muscles surrounding the knees . These muscles serve as shock absorbers , reducing the force that eventually gets transferred to the ACL and protecting against excessive rotation at the knee joint . Working on balance boards for as little as 20 minutes a day over a period of six weeks can improve coordination of the hamstrings and the gastrocnemius muscles in the calves , protecting the ACL during athletic twists and turns . Training properly and developing physical conditioning will not only help level the playing field for female athletes but also keep them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondent for NBC 's Today show .
