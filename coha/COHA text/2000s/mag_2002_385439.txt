Originally baked as a tribute to the end of winter 's sparse fare and later associated with the celebrations that followed periods of religious fasting , Easter 's light , yeast-risen loaves are abundantly laden with luxurious ingredients , such as cheese , almonds , candied citrus peel , and precious spices like cinnamon and saffron . The approach to holiday bread baking is one that sanctions us to lavish the loaves with extra care . Easter breads are customarily decorated with colored eggs , drizzled with icing , studded with bits of candied and dried fruit , divided into ropes of dough and elaborately braided into rounds , or stuffed with rich fillings . While the ancient meanings surrounding the ingredients and design of these celebratory breads are based on Easter and springtime traditions , the magnificent loaves that result , with their fine crumb and sweet flavor , are treats that can be savored throughout the year .
