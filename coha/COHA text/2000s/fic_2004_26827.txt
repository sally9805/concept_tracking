Skeleton Man Chapter One Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn , retired , had been explaining how the complicated happening below the Salt Woman Shrine illustrated his Navajo belief in universal connections . The cause leads to inevitable effect . The entire cosmos being an infinitely complicated machine all working together . His companions , taking their mid-morning coffee break at the Navajo Inn , did n't interrupt him . But they did n't seem impressed . " I 'll admit the half-century gap between the day all those people were killed here and Billy Tuve trying to pawn that diamond for twenty dollars is a problem , " Leaphorn said . " But when you really think about it , trace it all back , you see how one thing kept leading to another . The chain 's there . " Captain Pinto , who now occupied Joe Leaphorn 's preretirement office in the Navajo Tribal Police Headquarters , put down his cup . He signaled a refill to the waitress who was listening to this conversation , and waited a polite moment for Leaphorn to explain this if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded , sort of agreeing with himself . " Come on , Joe , " Pinto said . " I know how that theory works and I buy it . Hard , hot wind blowing gets the birds tired of flying . One too many birds lands on a limb . Limb breaks off , falls into a stream , diverts water flow , undercuts the stream bank , causes a landslide , blocks the stream , floods the valley , changes the flora and that changes the fauna , and the folks who were living off of hunting the deer have to migrate . When you think back you could blame it all on that wind . " Pinto stopped , got polite , attentive silence from his fellow coffee drinkers , and decided to add a footnote . " However , you have to do a lot of complicated thinking to work in that Joanna Craig woman . Coming all the way out from New York just because a brain-damaged Hopi tries to pawn a valuable diamond for twenty bucks . " Captain Largo , who had driven down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk-driving problem , entered the discussion . " Trouble is , Joe , the time gap is just too big to make you a good case . You say it started when the young man with the camera on the United Airlines plane was sort of like the last bird on Pinto 's fictional tree limb , so to speak . He mentioned to the stewardess he 'd like to get some shots down into the Grand Canyon when they were flying over it . Is n't that the theory ? The stewardess mentions that to the pilot , and so he does a little turn out of the cloud they 're flying through , and cuts right through the TWA airplane . That was June 30 , 1956 . All right . I 'll buy that much of it . Passenger asks a favor , pilot grants it . Boom . Everybody dead . End of incident . Then this spring , about five decades later , this Hopi fella , Billy Tuve , shows up in a Gallup pawnshop and tries to pawn a twenty-thousand-dollar diamond for twenty bucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a whole different business . I say it 's not just another chapter , it 's like a whole new book . Hell , Tuve had n't even been born yet when that collision happened . Right ? And neither had the Craig woman . " " Right , " said Pinto . " You have a huge gap in that cause-and-effect chain , Joe . And we 're just guessing the kid with the camera asked the pilot to turn . Nobody knows why the pilot did that . " Leaphorn sighed . " You 're thinking about the gap you see in one single connecting chain . I 'm thinking of a bunch of different chains which all seem to get drawn together . " Largo looked skeptical , shook his head , grinned at Leaphorn . " If you had one of your famous maps here , could you chart that out for us ? " " It would look like a spiderweb , " Pinto said . Leaphorn ignored that . " Take Joanna Craig 's role in this . The fact she was n't born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her daddy . From what Craig said , that caused her mama to become a bitter woman and that caused Craig to be bitter , too . Jim Chee told me she was n't really after those damned diamonds when she came to the canyon . She just wanted to find them so she could get revenge . " That produced no comment . " You see how that works , " Leaphorn said . " And that 's what drew that Bradford Chandler fellow into the case . The skip tracer . He may have been purely after money , but his job was blocking Craig from getting what she was after . That 's what sent him down into the canyon . And Cowboy Dashee was down there doing family duty . For Chee , the pull was friendship . And  --  " Leaphorn stopped , sentence unfinished . Pinto chuckled . " Go on , Joe , " he said . " How about Bernie Manuelito ? What pulled little Bernie into it ? " " It was fun for Bernie , " Leaphorn said . " Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I ca n't get over our little Bernie . I mean , how she managed to get herself out of that mess without getting killed . And another thing that 's hard to figure is how you managed to butt in . You 're supposed to be retired . " " Pinto gets the blame for that , " Leaphorn said . " Telling me old Shorty McGinnis had died . See ? That 's another of the chain I was talking about . " " I was just doing you a favor , Joe , " Pinto said . " I knew you were getting bored with retirement . Just wanted to give you an excuse to try your hand at detecting again . " " Saved your budget some travel money , too , " Leaphorn said , grinning . He was remembering that day , remembering how totally out-it-all he 'd felt , how happy he 'd been driving north in search of the McGinnis diamond  --  which he 'd never thought had actually existed . Now he was thinking about how a disaster buried under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions it had stirred . Greed , obviously , and hatred , plus family duty , a debt owed to a friend . And perhaps , in Bernie Manuelito 's case , even love .
