" Eh , Tree-ear ! Have you hungered well today ? " Crane-man called out as Tree-ear drew near the bridge . The well-fed of the village greeted each other politely by saying , " Have you eaten well today ? " Tree-ear and his friend turned the greeting inside out for their own little joke . Tree-ear squeezed the bulging pouch that he wore at his waist . He had meant to hold back the good news , but the excitement spilled out of him . " Crane-man ! A good thing that you greeted me so just now , for later today we will have to use the proper words ! " He held the bag high . Tree-ear was delighted when Crane-man 's eyes widened in surprise . He knew that Crane-man would guess at once -- only one thing could give a bag that kind of smooth fullness . Not carrot-tops or chicken bones , which protruded in odd lumps . No , the bag was filled with rice . Crane-man raised his walking crutch in a salute . " Come , my young friend ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth hearing , no doubt ! " Tree-ear had been trotting along the road on his early-morning perusal of the village rubbish heaps . Ahead of him a man carried a heavy load on a jiggeh , an open-framed backpack made of branches . On the jiggeh was a large woven-straw container , the kind commonly used to carry rice . Tree-ear knew that the rice must be from last year 's crop ; in the fields surrounding the village this season 's rice had only just begun to grow . It would be many months before the rice was harvested and the poor allowed to glean the fallen grain from the bare fields . Only then would they taste the pure flavor of rice and feel its solid goodness in theirbellies . Just looking at the straw box made water rush into Tree-ear 's mouth . The man had paused in the road and hoisted the wooden jiggeh higher on his back , shifting the cumbersome weight . As Tree-ear stared , rice began to trickle out of a hole in the straw box . The trickle thickened and became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . For a few short moments Tree-ear 's thoughts wrestled with one another . Tell him -- quickly ! Before he loses too much rice ! No ! Do n't say anything -- you will be able to pick up the fallen rice after he rounds the bend . . . . Tree-ear made his decision . He waited until the man had reached the bend in the road , then ran to catch him . " Honorable sir , " Tree-ear said , panting and bowing . " As I walked behind you , I noticed that you are marking your path with rice ! " The farmer turned and saw the trail of rice . A well-built man with a broad suntanned face , he pushed his straw hat back , scratched his head , and laughed ruefully . " Impatience , " said the farmer . " I should have had this container woven with a double wall . But it would have taken more time . Now I pay for not waiting a bit longer . " He struggled out of the jiggeh 's straps and inspected the container . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no avail , so he threw his arms up in mock despair . Tree-ear grinned . He liked the farmer 's easygoing nature . " Fetch me a few leaves , boy , " said the farmer . Tree-ear complied , and the man stuffed them into the container as a temporary patch . The farmer squatted to don the jiggeh . As he started walking , he called over his shoulder . " Good deserves good , urchin . The rice on the ground is yours if you can be troubled to gather it . " " Many thanks , kind sir ! " Tree-ear bowed , very pleased with himself . He had made a lucky guess , and his waist pouch would soon be filled with rice . Tree-ear had learned from Crane-man 's example . Foraging in the woods and rubbish heaps , gathering fallen grain-heads in the autumn -- these were honorable ways to garner a meal , requiring time and work . But stealing and begging , Crane-man said , made a man no better than a dog . " Work gives a man dignity , stealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crane-man 's advice was not always easy for Tree-ear . Today , for example . Was it stealing , to wait as Tree-ear had for more rice to fall before alerting the man that his rice bag was leaking ? Did a good deed balance a bad one ? Tree-ear often pondered these kinds of questions , alone or in discussion with Crane-man . " Such questions serve in two ways , " Crane-man had explained . " They keep a man 's mind sharp -- and his thoughts off his empty stomach . " Now , as always , he seemed to know Tree-ear 's thoughts without hearing them spoken . " Tell me about this farmer , " he said . " What kind of man was he ? " Tree-ear considered the question for several moments , stirring his memory . At last , he answered , " One who lacks patience -- he said it himself . He had not wanted to wait for a sturdier container to be built . And he could not be bothered to pick up the fallen rice . " Tree-ear paused . " But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were here now , and heard you tell of waiting a little longer before speaking , what do you think he would say or do ? " " He would laugh , " Tree-ear said , surprising himself with the speed of his response . Then , more slowly , " I think . . . he would not have minded . " Crane-man nodded , satisfied . And Tree-ear thought of something his friend often said : Scholars read the great words of the world . But you and I must learn to read the world itself . Tree-ear was so called after the mushroom that grew in wrinkled half-circles on dead or fallen tree trunks , emerging from the rotten wood without benefit of parent seed . A good name for an orphan , Crane-man said . If ever Tree-ear had had another name , he no longer remembered it , nor the family that might have named him so . Tree-ear shared the space under the bridge with Crane-man -- or rather , Crane-man shared it with him . After all , Crane-man had been there first , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisted calf and foot he had been born with made sure of that . Tree-ear knew the story of his friend 's name . " When they saw my leg at birth , it was thought I would not survive , " Crane-man had said . " Then , as I went through life on one leg , it was said that I was like a crane . But besides standing on one leg , cranes are also a symbol of long life . " True enough , Crane-man added . He had outlived all his family and , unable to work , had been forced to sell his possessions one by one , including , at last , the roof over his head . Thus it was that he had come to live under the bridge . Once , a year or so earlier , Tree-ear had asked him how long he had lived there . Crane-man shook his head ; he no longer remembered . But then he brightened and hobbled over to one side of the bridge , beckoning Tree-ear to join him . " I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " but I know how long you have . " And he pointed upward , to the underside of the bridge . " I wonder that I have not shown you this before . " On one of the slats was a series of deep scratches , as if made with a pointed stone . Tree-ear examined them , then shook his head at Crane-man . " So ? " " One mark for each spring since you came here , " Crane-man explained . " I kept count of your years , for I thought the time would come when you would like to know how old you are . " Tree-ear looked again , this time with keen interest . There was a mark for each finger of both hands -- ten marks in all . Crane-man answered before Tree-ear asked . " No , you have more than ten years , " he said . " When you first came and I began making those marks , you were in perhaps your second year -- already on two legs and able to talk . " From the Trade Paperback edition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
