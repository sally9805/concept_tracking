<p> On the eve of the 1997 season , rookie general manager Brian Sabean sweated through the final days of spring training the way a Broadway impresario frets before the opening of a $100 million extravaganza . Sabean 's first act was a showstopper : He traded Matt Williams , one of the most popular Giants ever , for a bunch of names that meant little to fans in San Francisco . <p> Kent , Vizcaino and Tavarez ? He might as well have acquired Huey , Dewey and Louie . <p> Sabean was savaged for the move . Amid a tornado of criticism from Giants ' fans and the press , he said , " I can see Matt has proven his credibility as a player . I 'm trying to prove mine as a general manager . " <p> It took one summer , which ended with the Giants winning the National League West . Now , as Sabean embarks on his 10th season at the tiller , his credibility lies in the Giants ' .558 winning percentage since he assumed the job from his mentor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Braves ( .605 ) have been better during that stretch . It lies in the three division titles , four playoff appearances , eight consecutive winning seasons and a near World Series championship in 2002 . <p> It also lies in an enviable track record of player acquisition that only recently was stained by a few notable failures , including A.J. Pierzynski for Joe Nathan and $26 million for Edgardo Alfonzo . <p> And yet , in the **32;6515;TOOLONG world of sports , Sabean finds his reputation on the line again after a 2005 season in which Barry Bonds missed all but three weeks and the Giants finished 75-87 , which breathed life into Sabean 's small , but vocal cadre of detractors . <p> Their principal arguments : The Giants ' success over the last decade has more to do with Bonds than Sabean , that this general manager is too enamored with geezers , and he is too quick to dismiss the new-age statistical approach to player evaluation described in Michael Lewis ' " Moneyball " and embraced by executives such as Oakland 's Billy Beane and Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove himself the way he did in 1997 , his legacy will be shaped not only by the Giants ' ability to return to the postseason in the coming years and finally win the Big One , but also by the kind of team he fashions once Bonds ' great talent and huge salary obligation vanish . <p> Sabean has one great advantage in his quest : job security . Only four of his contemporaries  --  John Schuerholz of Atlanta , Walt Jocketty of St. Louis , Terry Ryan of Minnesota and Kevin Towers of San Diego  --  have spent at least a decade in their current chairs . Like those four , Sabean can act without looking over his shoulder . <p> He does not take his longevity for granted . <p> " If you look at what 's going on in sports , especially at the front-office level or on the field with coaches and managers , 10 is a number that does n't come easily and also is very treasured , " Sabean said . " There are a lot of expectations now for all of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than stability . "  --   --   --  <p> Managing general partner Peter Magowan is so enamored with Sabean he will not reveal the length of the GM 's contract because he does not want other owners to know when Sabean might come available . <p> " Brian has nine years of track record now , and he deserves full responsibility for that long period of work , " Magowan said . " Eight of those years were very good and one was poor . I feel the poor record he had last year was a combination of some mistakes that were made in the way we evaluated our personnel , but a lot of it was not Brian 's fault . It 's not Brian 's fault Armando Benitez got hurt and not Brian 's fault that Bonds got hurt . <p> " I suppose I could get disenchanted with Brian with poor results , " Magowan said . " In this game , people have to stand on their record . He knows that . That 's the way it is in baseball . But I expect Brian always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative , he works hard and he 's got a good team of people around him . " <p> Indeed , Sabean leans on a seasoned kitchen cabinet of scouts and advisors that includes Dick Tidrow , Joe DiCarlo , Pat Dobson , Ted Uhlaender and , until he left to become GM of the Dodgers , Ned Colletti . At the same time , Sabean involves Magowan in the early stages of trades and signings , creating a trust that not only contributes to Sabean 's job security but also makes it easier to persuade Magowan to release a few more shekels for a player Sabean really wants come the midseason trade deadline . <p> The notable exception was Sabean 's November 2003 deal that sent Nathan and two pedigreed pitching prospects to Minnesota for Pierzynski , which Sabean and his advisors completed quickly without Magowan 's counsel . Magowan said he objected to the trade but too late to stop it . <p> " Brian goes about his position in a very methodical and thoughtful way , " Colletti said from his Dodger Stadium office . " He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so respectful of baseball operations . It 's about as good a match as you can have between baseball ownership and operations , and it works . There is respect both ways . " <p> Sabean 's " due diligence , " as he likes to call it , involves lots of scouting , phone calls , medical reviews and , according to insiders , much Socratic discussion . <p> Colletti recalled the decision that shaped Sabean 's tenure , the Matt Williams trade , was hatched after a long night of the two men walking and talking in Montreal following a 1996 game against the Expos . Sabean , then an assistant , knew he was going to be promoted to GM and knew the Giants could not thrive with Williams and Bonds consuming 40 percent of the payroll . <p> By the time they returned to the team hotel , Colletti said , the sun was rising and Sabean knew he had to move Williams . In return , Sabean got a future MVP ( Kent ) , a starting shortstop ( Vizcaino ) and a serviceable reliever ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plus another $750,000 from the Angels in the deal that netted J.T. Snow . He used all that money to sign center fielder Darryl Hamilton . <p> When the Giants won the West that year , after Sabean made another huge deal in July for White Sox pitchers Wilson Alvarez , Roberto Hernandez and Danny Darwin , his reputation as a wheeler-dealer was cemented . His abilities as a trader and talent evaluator engender almost universal respect from his peers . <p> " I think he 's a very bright guy and he 's shrewd , " said former Mets GM Steve Phillips , now an ESPN analyst , who consummated a 2001 deal with Sabean that sent Shawn Estes to New York for Tsuyoshi Shinjo and Desi Relaford . " He works to make deals , he knows what they look like when he sees them and he looks to make a fair deal , not a one-sided deal . <p> " He keeps things very close to the vest . He does n't share what he 's doing , where he 's going . Yet , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't play games with you . He 's very blunt and very frank about what he likes . " <p> In fact , Phillips said , Sabean can be " brash at times . You can get him in a bad mood , find him at a time when he 's worked up . " <p> Phillips recalls sitting in an adjacent booth during the 2000 Division Series between the Mets and Giants . He heard Sabean screaming and pounding the table when a play did not go the Giants ' way . Conversely , when Snow hit a three-run homer in the ninth to tie Game 2 , Phillips said he heard Sabean happily go " berserk . " <p> Although Sabean is hardly a recluse , he never has courted the press . If he ever stopped being a GM , he would go into bullfighting before he would follow Phillips to an ESPN studio . <p> Washington Nationals GM Jim Bowden , not a Sabean friend or confidant , said , " Brian is one of the best general managers in baseball . He has also been one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seek the attention of the national media . He 's well respected throughout the industry . " <p> Dennis Gilbert , once Bonds ' agent and now a special assistant to White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf , said Sabean has done " a hell of a job . He is consistently near the top of his division , and I ca n't remember one year he had the highest payroll in his division . I think that really says it all . That 's really how you judge a general manager . "  --   --   --  <p> The Giants ' payroll always has an elephantine number next to the name " Barry Bonds , " and Sabean 's challenge has been building consistent winners without barrels of cash to spend on complementary players . Over his nine years he has concluded the best way was to concentrate on now and worry about later , later . <p> " The formula is pretty simple , " Sabean said . " When you have a Barry Bonds on your team , and I 've talked to a lot of people in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put yourself in a position , within the limits that you live with , to go for it every year . The tried-and-true way is to build with as much experience as you can get . <p> " Would I love to have a younger team ? Without question . Do I love younger players ? Certainly . Their time might come sooner or later with Barry 's departure . But to have Barry on the ballclub , and with that window of opportunity , long-range planning is pretty difficult to do . " <p> Acquisitions such as Moises Alou , Omar Vizquel and Steve Finley embody that philosophy . So did Rich Aurilia 's three-year apprenticeship under a long line of older shortstops ( Vizcaino , Rey Sanchez and Shawon Dunston ) . <p> Although it is hard to argue with the results , Sabean 's reliance on such players has drawn fire from a new breed of fans , and even some baseball folk , who believe the key to team-building in the Internet age lies not in the tired eyes of scouts but in the " sabermetric " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steven Rubio , a 52-year-old college English professor from Berkeley , has written on the subject for the Baseball Prospectus and said Sabean " clearly has a blind spot about on-base percentage , which , to a sabermetrician , is more important than life itself . " <p> The king of OBP is Bonds . Rubio and like-minded fans believe the left fielder , more than Sabean , deserves credit for the Giants ' gaudy winning percentages . <p> " I do n't know that Sabean ( deserves ) credit for Bonds the way he gets credit for Kent , " he said , " since I think without Bonds the last number of years look a lot different . Last year , with Bonds out , seemed to me the sign of what a Sabean team looks like , and it was n't pretty . " <p> That argument ignores the fact that nearly one-fourth of the Giants ' 2005 payroll was in Los Angeles last summer trying to get that rickety knee back in baseball shape . Also , history is rife with examples of teams featuring great players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team stank . <p> Sabean suggested that his July 31 acquisition of Randy Winn last year catalyzed the Giants long before Bonds ' return in September , just as the 2002 team that won the pennant caught fire only after he traded for Kenny Lofton to spark a lineup that had Bonds for a full year . <p> The three seasons since have disappointed many Giants fans , whose expectations have risen so high they consider the 100-win 2003 season a failure because the team lost in the first round of the playoffs . <p> That was the Giants ' first season post-Kent . Now , Sabean views the circumstances of the second baseman 's departure as his greatest regret . That spring , Kent broke his wrist in a motorcycle accident that he did not divulge to management , creating anger all around . <p> Sabean asks himself if the hard feelings encouraged Kent to snub the Giants ' contract offer before the 2003 season and sign with Houston . That prompted Sabean to sign Alfonzo to be the new run producer , a four-year , $26 million contract that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years as the third baseman underperformed . <p> " You just wonder if the acrimony that built up ( with Kent ) could have been softened or dissipated , if we communicated and understood each other , whether that would have made a difference , " Sabean said .  --   --   --  <p> After the Giants ' hasty exit from the 2003 postseason , Sabean encountered the largest groundswell of criticism during his tenure as he failed to move on a number of attractive free agents , particularly Vladimir Guerrero . Never mind that Guerrero did not express a desire to come to San Francisco , or that ownership would not expand the payroll enough to let Sabean make a run at any big name . <p> In a Chronicle article in January 2004 , Sabean bemoaned a " lunatic fringe " that he felt had incited unwarranted criticism of the front office . The pro-Vladimir crowd took offense , although Sabean later said he was referring to a few columnists and talk-show hosts , not the paying customers . <p> Although Sabean has gotten better reviews for more recent moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Finley and the Matt Morris signing , one segment of the fandom insists Sabean ca n't be judged a success without a World Series championship . <p> Sabean said he would be disappointed if he left San Francisco without a title , but when asked if he would consider his tenure a failure if the Giants do n't win one , Sabean said , " Probably not , because the more you are around the game the more you realize how difficult it is to win and finish things off . A lot of it is about the journey . We played the last inning you could possibly play in a baseball season , which is Game 7 of the World Series , and you take pride in that . <p> " You 're not alone if you look at the Buffalo Bills of the world , how many straight years they won yet never won the Super Bowl . I do n't think that organization , at that time , starting with ( head coach ) Marv Levy and the players who were there , think of themselves as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabean said , " We 've all had a big part making San Francisco a baseball town . I 'm smart enough to realize the stadium was part of that , and our timing against the local football teams not doing well has helped that . But from ' 97 on we 've really given people reason to have hope and reasons to be involved with the team . "  --   --   --  <p> The most recent stretch of Sabean 's tenure has been rough for reasons beyond the standings . Although he is loath to discuss it , confidants say family issues as well as his father 's death in 2004 weighed heavily on the GM . <p> Sabean , who confesses to being a workaholic , rarely takes a vacation . And colleagues say the few times he did leave town with his family he stayed in constant cell-phone contact . He conceded his obsession with the job " has affected the people around me . " <p> Friends and colleagues see a change , however , a realization from Sabean that his life does not begin and end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building the 2006 team and reorganizing the front office to account for Colletti 's departure , Sabean took not one , but two international honeymoon trips with his wife , Amanda , whom he married in November . He also has four sons , aged 12 to 17 , and is spending more time watching them play baseball and football , to the delight of friends who believe Sabean needed more life in his life . <p> " I turn 50 in July , " Sabean said . " I 'm still very challenged by the opportunities we 've been given to continue on after a 75-win season . More so , I know I have the same commitment as I did when I first started . The challenge is to find the balance needed to have more longevity . We all know this is a year-round job . Much like a doctor , seemingly you 're always on call . <p> " The challenge for me now  --  in Ned 's absence  --  is to lean on other people and feel confident that when I 'm not around , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be handled properly , and you do n't miss a beat . " <p> A big question for Giants fans is whether the team will miss a beat when Bonds finally packs his gear and vacates his special corner of the clubhouse . There is no guarantee that Sabean will be the architect of that rebuilding project , but he said he welcomes the challenge . <p> Colletti believes that opportunity will give Sabean a chance to be " creative and rejuvenated . " <p> Sabean also will have considerable leeway to do it his way . Within the brick walls at Third and King streets , he sits in an office 10 steps from the owner . Their tight relationship affords Sabean the ability to take chances . Had he been cowed by the backlash against the Nathan trade  --  which , remember , Magowan opposed  --  Sabean never could have dealt a player equally liked by the fans ( Jesse Foppert ) to Seattle for Winn . <p> Moreover , Sabean has weathered his few serious controversies and still enjoys widespread support from the populace , particularly the older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ franchise had sunk . <p> Even Rubio , the English professor who considers himself a Sabean detractor , conceded that when he argues his position at the ballpark , ticket-holders in his section tell him to buzz off . <p> " The average fans think he 's doing a great job , " Rubio said , " and with that record , why should n't they ? " <p> Sabean 's moves through the years <p> Oct. 1 , 1996 : Promoted from assistant general manager to general manager by Giants owner Peter Magowan , who fears Sabean will be hired away by another team . Current GM Bob Quinn is retained as a consultant . . <p> Nov. 13 , 1996 : Sends fan favorite Matt Williams to Cleveland for Jeff Kent , Jose Vizcaino and Julian Tavarez , his signature trade .
