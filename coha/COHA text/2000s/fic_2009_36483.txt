Daddy Beer Presents Daddy Time Football <p> Have you ever wondered why your daddy likes beer so much ? Have you wondered , before you fall asleep at night , why he sometimes acts kind of " funny " after he 's been drinking beer ? Maybe you 've even wondered where beer comes from , because you 're pretty sure it is n't from a cow . Well , Gracie Perkel wondered those same things . <p> " Mommy , " Gracie asked one afternoon , " what 's that stuff Daddy drinks ? " " You mean coffee , sweetie ? " <p> " Not coffee . Ick ! That other stuff that 's yellow and looks like pee-pee . " <p> " Gracie ! " <p> " You say pee-pee . " <p> " Well , when I 'm talking about potty time I might . But I do n't say it about somebody 's beverage . " <p> Gracie giggled . Her mother , who was busy loading clothes in the washer , suggested without looking up , " I believe , dear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " squealed Gracie . " That 's right . Beer . That stuff that 's always on TV . " She deepened her voice . " ' Better tasting ! ' ' Less filling ! ' ' Better tasting ! ' ' Less filling ! ' " She giggled again . " Is it kinda like Pepsi for silly old men ? " <p> Mrs. Perkel smiled , but it was such a weak , wimpy smile a kitten could have knocked it halfway to Milwaukee . She paused in her work to stare out of the laundry room window . The clouds themselves looked like a big pile of dirty laundry . That was not unusual because , you see , the Perkel family lived in Seattle . <p> Do you know about drizzle , that thin , soft rain that could be mistaken for a mean case of witch measles ? Seattle is the world headquarters of drizzle , and in autumn it leaves a damp gray rash on everything , as though the city were a baby that had been left too long in a wet diaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a biting wind , as there was this day , Seattle people sometimes feel like they 're trapped in a bad Chinese restaurant ; one of those drafty , cheaply lit places where the waiters are gruff , the noodles soggy , the walls a little too green , and although there 's a mysterious poem inside every fortune cookie , tea is invariably spilt on your best sweater . Mrs. Perkel must have been feeling that way , for she sighed at the limp pork dumplings ( or were they wadded Pampers ? ) in the sky and said to Gracie , " If you want to know about beer you should go ask your father . " <p> Never mind that she was wearing fluffy fuzzy bunny slippers , Gracie still tiptoed into the den . Her daddy was watching football on their new flat plasma screen , and if the University of Washington was losing again , he 'd be in a grumpy mood . Uh-oh . She overheard a naughty word . UW was losing . Gracie was relieved , however , when she noticed that Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , to mooch a few beers from her dad . <p> Uncle Moe did n't take sports very seriously . He called himself a philosopher , if you know what that is . He 'd graduated from about a dozen colleges , seldom ever seemed to work , and had traveled just about every place a person could go without getting his head chopped off . Mrs. Perkel said he was a " nut job , " but Gracie liked him . It did n't bother her that he had a face like a sinkful of last night 's dinner dishes or that his mustache resembled a dead sparrow . <p> Timidly , Gracie tapped Mr. Perkel on the elbow . Her voice was shy and squeaky when she asked , " Daddy , can I please taste your beer ? " <p> " No way , " her father snorted over his shoulder . His eyes never left the screen . " Beer 's for grown-ups . " <p> Gracie turned toward Uncle Moe , who grinned and beckoned her over , as she had suspected he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , behind her daddy 's back , little Gracie Perkel took her first sip of beer . " Ick ! " She made a face . " It 's bitter . " <p> " The better to quench your thirst , my dear . " <p> " What makes it bitter , Uncle Moe ? " <p> " Well , it 's made from hops . " <p> Gracie made another face . " You mean them jumpy bugs that . . . ? <p> " No , pumpkin , beer is n't extracted from grasshoppers . Nor hop toads , either . A hop is some funky vegetable that even vegans wo n't eat . Farmers dry the flowers of this plant and call them ' hops . ' I should mention that only the female hop plants are used in making beer , which may be why men are so attracted to it . It 's a mating instinct . " <p> " Moe ! " <p> The uncle ignored Gracie 's father . " In any event , " he went on , " when brewers combine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mixture to ferment  --  to rot  --  it magically produces an elixir so gassy with blue-collar cheer , so regal with glints of gold , so titillating with potential mischief , so triumphantly refreshing , that it seizes the soul and thrusts it toward that ethereal plateau where , to paraphrase Baudelaire , all human whimsies float and merge . " <p> " Do n't be talking that crap to her . She 's five years old . " <p> " Almost six , " chimed Gracie . <p> " In Italy and France , a child Gracie 's age could walk into an establishment , order a beer , and be served . " <p> " Yeah , well those people are crazy . " <p> " Perhaps so  --  but there 's far fewer alcohol problems in their countries than in safe and sane America . " <p> Mr. Perkel muttered something vague before focusing his frown on UW 's latest boo-boo . Uncle Moe removed another beer from the cooler , holding it up for Gracie to admire . " Beer was invented by the ancient Egyptians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the mummies ? " <p> " Exactly , although I do n't believe there 's any connection . At least I hope not . The point is , the Egyptians could have invented lemonade  --  but they chose to invent beer instead . " <p> While Gracie thought this over , Uncle Moe pulled the metal tab on the top of his beer can . There was a snap , followed by a spritzy hiss and a small discharge of foam . Uncle Moe took a long drink , wiped foam from his tragic mustache , and said , " Speaking of inventions , did you know that the tin can was invented in
