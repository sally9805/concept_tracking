. From eagles and exclusives to beautiful boats and unbelievable adventures , we touch a lot of bases ( and emotions ) this month . SEEN ANY AMERICAN BALD EAGLES LATELY , DIVING FOR DINNER IN THE WILDS OF BRITISH COLUMBIA ? Been fishing around the Outer Banks of North Carolina ? Driving a PWC from Miami to Bimini ? Or cruising around Portsmouth , R.I. , on one of the prettiest new boats you 'll see this year ( or in many a year , for that matter ) ? Well , these are the things our editors have been covering the past few weeks , the stories and features and adventures that bring Motor Boating to life each month . First things first . We sent our Contributing Editor Chris Caswell up to some of the most beautiful country in the world , Princess Louisa Inlet and Chatterbox Falls , as part of a story about life on the brand-new Maritimo 52 ( our worldwide exclusive ) , an Aussie-built yacht that will be introduced to the U.S. at the fall boat shows . Since Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats in many parts of the world , but he had n't been in this part of B.C. before , and he 'd never seen an eagle before . I was going to say that I 'm a bit jaded about eagles , since I just came back from the Grand Banks 50th Anniversary cruise way up in Alaska , farther north than Chris ' trip , where we saw lots of eagles . But that 's nonsense . If an eagle in the wilderness does n't send shivers up your spine , you 're beyond help ; it is a glory of nature , whether it 's your first eagle or your 100th . Then take a look at our exclusive cover story on the new Grady-White 305 Express , which Roy Attaway took around Ocracoke and Bath in North Carolina . Roy knows his way around that part of the world , since he 's been fishing there since he was a child . He also knows his way around a Grady . He used to own one and I know that I ca n't count the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Elsewhere around the country , Louisa Rudeen Beckett covers the first ( as far as we know ) rally of PWCs from Miami to Bimini . That 's what I call an adventure . Do n't try this on your own . Our rally had two Formula yachts along as chase boats . And Dennis Caprio tested the beautiful new Legacy 32 in Portsmouth ( only because I had a previous commitment ; I love this boat ) . Dennis loved it , too , as you can read in his story . You can see why when you look at Onne van der Wal 's pictures . Onne is one of the best marine photographers in the world , but he outdid himself this time . The point of all this is that our staff goes places and does things . We bring you more than boat tests ; we try to evoke the passion and the emotions that are the best of the boating experience . Yes , it 's a dirty job , but we love it . And we try to share that enthusiasm with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control for your boat ? Catalytic converters ? In his preview of what 's coming in inboard engines , TIM BANSE , our engine expert , looks at these and other new developments - plus the joystick wars between Volvo Penta 's IPS drive and Mercury 's Zeus . When he was n't cruising around Alaska , Managing Editor JOHN WOOLDRIDGE produced our fall boat show preview and our Used Boat column about the popular Formula 40 - the boat that Formula President Scott Porter and I took to Cuba a few years ago . Back from a cruising vacation in the Bahamas on his Bertram 28 , Senior Editor JOHN CLEMANS got back to his How To franchise , the best in the business , with a vengeance , showing us how to install an additional cleat or put up a new Bimini . This month DAN FALES , our electronics columnist , takes a look at the new navigation programs that allow computers to get info from your GPS , radar , fishfinder or even weather services and video cameras .
