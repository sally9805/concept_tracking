The night the police came to arrest my husband for murder , I was upstairs , killing myself on the treadmill . If I kept up this pace , I 'd finish my three miles in twenty-two and a half minutes , a personal best . So when I heard the doorbell ring , I ignored it , and then ignored it again . But whoever was chiming would n't go away and the noise was going to wake up the whole house . Annoyed , I hit the stop button , threw a Juicy Couture sweatshirt on over my pink running bra and matching shorts , kicked off my all-terrain cross-trainers , which were giving me blisters anyway , and headed downstairs . No personal best tonight . The Chinese cloisonn clock in the front hall foyer registered ll:50 P.M. , not a typical time for guests to arrive at our gated community in Pacific Palisades . I tried peering through the peephole in the door , but the artistically cut crystal sphere had been designed for beauty , not usefulness . I could vaguely make out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tentatively called out " Hello ? " they waved their identification cards , not knowing that from my side , those IDs could have been Picasso graphics . I made a mental note to check out more practical security systems . Cops at my door ? My first emotion was curiosity , not panic , since those I loved and worried about full-time were tucked in upstairs . Grant had turned in early to get some rest before ascience test tomorrow , Ashley had communed with two girlfriends until just after ten then gone straight to her own bedroom , and little Jimmy had heard monsters rumbling in his closet but managed to get to sleep after I read him three picture books and pretended to fall asleep first . Even my husband , Dan , had spent forty-five minutes reading medical journals and then set his alarm for dawn so he 'd be up for early-morning surgery . I twisted the ring on my right hand so that the big ruby and two small diamonds pointed into my palm , then opened the door , glancing first at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then to the other cop , slightly older and shorter , dour and doughy-faced . " We need Dr. Dan Fields , ma'am , " the older cop said , his voice as rough-edged as his body . " What for ? " " I 'd like to explain that directly to the doctor . " I was sweaty and tired and not interested in conversing with cagey cops . But I had an idea what was going on here , since about a month ago , a three-car police escort had come to whisk Dan to the hospital to take care of a major actress who had sliced off her finger cutting a bagel . My husband was the Saint of Hollywood , the plastic surgeon whose skill at molding , reattaching , and reconstructing meant he could save any face or body part that was seriously endangered . This being Hollywood , he had also nipped and tucked some of the most famous faces on the planet , and the wait for a consultation at one point stretched to eight months . If you could n't get an appointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Vogue or Elle . No doubt written by editors who figured that with enough sweet talk , Dan would move them to the top of the waiting list . " Has somebody been hurt ? " I asked the cop . " Someone 's been hurt real bad . " He took a step toward me , edging in front of his buddy , a sneer contorting his features . " Now go get Dr. Fields for us . " His menacing style would n't work . " Look , Dan 's gone to sleep already , " I said , trying not to sound as intimidated as I felt . " Why do n't you tell me what this is about ? " The Hispanic cop glanced back over his shoulder at his partner , who was pocketing his identification , then repeated , " Just get the doctor for us . " " If you 're looking for a favor from Dan , you could ask a little more politely , " I said . The cops exchanged looks , then the Hispanic one said , " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't call him down , we 'll go get him . We know he 's in the house . " The guy was a genius . I say Dan 's gone to bed and he figures out that he 's in the house . " If you do n't call it a favor to come by here at almost midnight and ask for Dan ... " I stopped , because they were both looking at me oddly , and the message finally penetrated that I was off base . Way off base . Maybe not even in the right playing field . I took a deep breath and , looking again at the doughy-faced cop , noticed that his badge said Detective Vincent Shields and that his buddy was Detective Jos Reese . Shields quietly said , " I assume Dr. Fields is your husband . He 's wanted for questioning . " I stood there , unable to move , and Shields added , " We 're investigating a murder . " He pointed to the intercom by the front door . " Can you call him down ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well have been a moon rock that had dropped into my front hall . I cleared my throat . I pulled myself back together . " Uh , the thing is , we just remodeled the top floor and wiring it into the old system has been a problem , you know ? The electrician kept saying he could do it , even though he could n't do it , so we probably need a whole new system or at least a whole new electrician , if you know what I mean .... " I paused , wondering if I could make myself stop babbling . Maybe some action would do it . I stepped over to the intercom , touched the talk button and the " Master Bedroom " light , and then said , " Dan ? Honey ? Can you hear me ? " For a response , I got static . I ran my fingers through my curly hair , pushing it back from my forehead , which was still sweaty from the treadmill . And getting even sweatier from the fear suddenly coursing through me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You want to lead us ? " I did n't want to do anything of the sort . Having the cops in my marble foyer was horrifying enough . But it did n't really occur to me that I could say no to a man with a badge . " Mommy ? Is it monsters ? " I spun around and saw Jimmy standing at the top of the steps , peering down at us through a railing . His ankles stuck out of his too-short Superman pajamas at an odd angle , and he looked so skinny and vulnerable that I wanted to run right up the stairs and give him a hug . But the cops were eyeing me intently and sudden moves did n't seem like a good idea . " No , honey , everything 's fine . No monsters , just these nice policemen . " I smiled bravely and tried to keep my lip from quivering . Jimmy had put on his old superhero pajamas tonight so he could fight any monsters who showed up in his room , but who knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can you do Mommy a favor ? " He stepped back from the railing and eyed me carefully  --  even at five , he would n't commit until he knew the dimensions of the request . " Go to Mommy and Daddy 's room and give Daddy a little shake . Tell Daddy that Mommy needs him to put on a robe and come down . " Jimmy ran off so quickly that I was n't sure if he 'd taken it in or was simply fleeing to hide under his covers . Slowly , I turned to the cops again , but they were muttering to each other . Detective Shields glanced at his watch and said , " I do n't like this . In two minutes you go up . " " Lemme go now . No way the guy 's coming down . " Shields nodded , and the two of them headed for the staircase , clambering quickly up the steps two at a time , their smooth-soled shoes slipping on the Italian marble . At the top landing they stopped short , peering at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to glare at me as I dashed up the stairs behind them . " Where do we find him ? " he growled . Trying to catch my breath  --  lost to anxiety , not exertion  --  I did n't answer . " Which of these damn hallways ? " he bellowed . " Our bedroom 's to your right , " I said , gasping . Then , not meaning to scream , I did anyway . " Dan ! " I hollered . From down the hall , my husband appeared at the bedroom door , his blond hair rumpled , his face blank from interrupted sleep . He had n't bothered with a robe , just a pair of sweatpants , and he took a moment to register that there were two cops approaching him . When he did , his deep blue eyes widened and he blinked hard . " What 's going on ? " he asked groggily . The cops moved closer , surrounding him as effectively as two people can . " You 're Dr. Daniel Fields ? " asked Shields . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His refined accent grew more refined as the cops leaned in . Even bare-chested , he maintained his dignity . A well-toned , well-tanned chest can do that for you . " Well , doc , you can come down to the station house with us . Right now . Quietly , " said Shields , with a hint of threat in his voice . " Would you like to explain why ? " Shields took a moment to answer , digging his toe into the fringe of the Persian rug , then looking at Jimmy , who had slipped out of the bedroom and was edging closer to his dad . " We need you for questioning , " Shields said , discreetly not elaborating while one scared Superman stared wide-eyed at him . " And it ca n't wait until morning ? " Dan asked . " No . Now . " " Help me out here , gentlemen . I do n't have any idea what this is about or why you need to talk to me . " Dan sounded composed and reasonable , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not confronting two LAPD cops . Jimmy anxiously rubbed his hand over the big S emblem on his chest . But the shield would n't protect him , and neither would Reese . " You 're wanted for questioning in the murder of Theresa Bartowski , " he said bluntly . " I do n't even know who that is . Why would you want to talk to me ? " " She 's also known as Tasha Barlow . " Not the slightest wave of recognition crossed Dan 's face . " Is this a former patient of mine ? " he asked . " We can discuss it all downtown , " Reese said . " No , let 's discuss it here . Or better still , why do n't you call me at my office in the morning ? I 'll pull out my patient records and do whatever I can to help you . But right now , if you 'll excuse me , I have to get back to bed . I have surgery scheduled for seven A.M. and I 'm not eager to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another look , and with a move too quick to allow either reaction or resistance , Reese whipped handcuffs out of his back pocket and snapped them on Dan 's slender wrists . " You 're under arrest in the murder of Tasha Barlow , " he intoned . " You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be used against you in  --  " " What the hell are you doing ? " Dan 's voice , suddenly shrill , warbled through the hall . "  --  a court of law . You have the right  --  " " Get these off me ! " Dan staggered back , holding his arms outstretched like oddities that no longer belonged to his body . Trying to spin around and make his case for release , he accidentally slammed his handcuffed wrists against Reese , who hastily stepped back and reached for his gun . Shields had his weapon drawn the moment his partner was touched , and it was trained on Dan . Jimmy began wailing , a high-pitched , hysterical sound that perfectly mimicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him into my arms , running down the hall with him , past the staircase , away from the police and guns , and into his room , which , even infested with monsters , seemed safer than where we had been . In a single motion , I slipped him into his bed and tucked in the covers , murmuring , " You 're fine , honey . Everything 's going to be fine . " He stopped crying , more from surprise at suddenly finding himself under the cozy sheets than from any deeper comfort I 'd supplied . I yearned to crawl in next to him and hide my head under his pillow . But as I stroked Jimmy 's tear-streaked face , I could hear Dan 's plaintive voice from down the hall calling , " Lacy ? Lacy ? " My heart banged so furiously that I could hear the pounding in my ears . I 'd been a G.I. Joe-banning , Second Amendment-doubting citizen long enough that the simple sight of a gun scared me beyond all reason . Having two of them aimed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on the bed trying to hide my shock . Jimmy lay suddenly still , as if monsters might be a welcome diversion from the real-life drama . His eyes were closed and his breathing placid , as if he had willed himself to sleep . I pulled myself together and hurried back down the long hallway to the group in front of our bedroom . The cops ' guns were back in their holsters , and Dan , still bound at the wrists , was trying to reason with Shields . " I have to get dressed , " Dan was saying quietly . " If you take off the handcuffs , I can be quick . " Shields looked skeptical for a moment but then nodded . " Okay , I 'll give you three minutes to put on some clothes . But we 're keeping you within eyesight . The door stays open so we can see you . " He nodded at Reese to unlock the cuffs , and the detective reached for the key reluctantly . " You want me to call for some backup to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key . " Do n't want him escaping while he 's pretending to look for his Calvins . " " I think we 're under control , " Shields said . But Reese pushed into the bedroom before Dan . " I 'll just wait in here . " I stepped closer to Dan and touched his elbow . " What 's happening ? " He turned around to look at me , and his face was tightly controlled , giving up nothing . " I have no idea . But apparently I 'm going downtown with these fellows . " " Do you know what they want ? Do you know who that woman is ? Does this make any sense ? " I asked , my questions tumbling on top of each other . " No , " said Dan , one firm negative covering it all . Then calmly , " I 'll have to straighten it out . " " How do you straighten it out when they 've arrested you ? " I asked , practically screeching . Dan picked up my panic , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call Jack , " he said , meaning Jack Rosenfeld , family friend and attorney . " Good idea . " We filed into the bedrooom together , and feeling awkward under Shields 's gaze , I tripped clumsily against the edge of the rug . But I steadied myself , picked up the cordless phone on the night table , and dialed Jack 's house . An answering machine beeped , and I left an urgent message for Jack to call me as soon as possible . I started to stutter out more details but then realized I could n't figure them out myself . When I hung up , Dan had pulled on crisp khakis and a navy blue polo shirt and was heading into the bathroom . " Just a minute , " Reese said . He pushed into the room ahead of Dan and jerked his head back in surprise , momentarily staggered by the gleaming marble and brass fittings of our high-tech bathroom . I used to cherish each fancy fixture , but now I could n't care less . If it would only make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an outhouse . " A lot of windows in here , " Reese called back to his partner , staring up at the arched glass ceiling . " I 'm not trying to escape , " Dan said mildly . " I need to use the bathroom . " Reese peered out one of the oversized windows , contemplating the two-story drop . Then he sauntered to the other end of the bathroom . " What 's through here ? " " The spa . " Reese opened the sliding door , and the wall of mirrors on the other side reflected his astonishment as he took in the huge Jacuzzi whirlpool and natural-wood hot tub . " Nice setup you 've got here , " he said acidly . " I 'll just wait on this side while you do your business . " The bathroom door clicked shut , and I edged toward the bed , reeling from this bizarre alternate reality in which I 'd suddenly landed . Shields kept his back to me , not encouraging conversation , and I rubbed my finger back and forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would I be able to feel the silk fabric sliding against my fingers ? I blinked hard a few times and then the bathroom door opened again to reveal Dan back in handcuffs , with Reese at his elbow . " We 're ready , " Reese said . Shields nodded . " Let 's go . " Dan took a few steps toward me . " Will you come with me ? " he asked . His hooded eyes held mine , needing me . I thought of the kids down the hall , asleep . Jimmy would likely wake up again , which meant that if I left , Grant or Ashley should be warned . " No , she wo n't come , " Reese said . " It 's not a party . No extra room in the squad car . " " I 'll follow in my own car , " I said with sudden certainty , his hostility solving my quandary . " Where are we going ? " " Downtown , " he snarled . " There 's really nothing for you to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but without anger , the senior man getting the job done . " But here 's the address if you really want to go . " He handed me a card , and as I glanced at it , the partners soundlessly whisked Dan out of the room . From the hall , I heard my husband calling , " Lacy ! " " I 'll be there , honey ! " I hollered . " I 'll follow you and be there . " I raced to Grant 's room , then , remembering that he needed a night 's sleep before the test , I moved on to his sister 's sanctuary . Fourteen-year-old Ashley , curled up under the flowing canopy on her bed , did n't move when I burst in , so I shook her gently , telling her that Daddy and I had to run out and she needed to get up if Jimmy called . Only half awake , she did n't ask any questions , and before she could think of any , I sprinted downstairs , slipping into the Lexus and pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunned the car down the block and by the second stop sign  --  where I definitely did n't bother to stop  --  I had the squad car within sight . I felt a surge of relief that at least the night would n't end with my turning back . The cop car was going fast but not recklessly , no sirens blasting or lights flashing , and I managed to keep the red taillights within easy view . They knew the neighborhood , winding their way through the dark streets without any hesitation . I kept expecting the squad car to stop suddenly and pull a U-turn in the middle of the road . I 'd look in the window and see the faux cops laughing uproariously at getting away with a prank like this . Maybe they represented a medical fraternity doing a grown-up form of hazing . Or they had the starring roles on Cops 911 , that new Fox show shooting on a nearby soundstage . We 'd watch the tape tomorrow and laugh , and Dan would sign the waiver so the episode could air . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunset Boulevard and suddenly , even at midnight , the traffic was thicker . A red Ferrari slipped in front of me , but I could still track the cops , and when we all turned onto the highway , the Ferrari zoomed ahead and I inched closer to the unmarked LAPD car . As I drove , a name kept repeating over and over in my head . Tasha Barlow . Tasha Barlow . Tasha Barlow . I waited for some bells to ring , but got resounding silence . I 'd been married to Dan since we were kids just out of college , long enough to read his facial expressions pretty accurately , and nothing had registered when he 'd heard the name , either . If this was n't all a joke , it must just be a case of mistaken identity . Dan was right . The whole mess would get cleared up as soon as he got to headquarters . From my car phone , I dialed Jack Rosenfeld again , got the same message , and this time left my cell phone number , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the radio to an all-news station , wondering if I might hear something about Tasha Barlow . But no , just more of the usual  --  mud slides in Malibu , a loss for the Lakers , and a Brinks truck overturning on the 110 freeway and spilling a million nickels on the road . How to get rich in L.A. I turned the radio off , and when we exited the highway , I focused on negotiating the now unfamiliar back streets . After some fast turns , the cops pulled into a spot marked police vehicles only , and I realized we had arrived at headquarters . Of course I did n't see any place to park , so I rolled down the window . " Okay if I leave it here ? " I shouted to Shields , who was pulling himself out of the passenger seat of the squad car . " No , ma'am . Police cars only . You 'll have to find parking around the other side of the building . " Instead of dumping the car and telling them to tow it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasted five minutes cruising around the ugly block , squeezing my car into a too-small space in front of what had once been a deli and was now a boarded-up storefront . Courage is not exactly my middle name , but I hardly thought about the unsavory characters lurking around as I slammed my car door shut and clicked the remote lock . I started running back to the station house , my shoes making an eerie , clinking sound against the broken sidewalk . I looked down and realized that in my haste to grab footwear as I left the house , I 'd slipped into a pair of purple snakeskin Manolo Blahnik mules with high , spindly heels . My Wild Berry Chanel-manicured toenails peeked through the open toes . Above the ankles , I was still wearing pale pink Lycra workout gear . Charging down the street in this getup , I was probably pretty safe  --  anybody would assume that some pissed-off pimp was chasing me . Inside the station house , everything seemed surprisingly quiet . A sleepy-eyed cop at the front desk munching take-out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when I told her I was looking for my husband , Dr. Dan Fields , she waved toward some chairs at a far wall . " Better siddown , " she said , sounding like a transplant from Brooklyn . " Can I join him , please ? " " Nope . Siddown . " " He is here , correct ? I 'm in the right place ? " She shrugged . " I guess so . " " I told the policemen who took him that I 'd be following in my car , " I said , persisting . " I 'm sure they 're expecting me . " " Yeah , they set an extra place , " she said snidely . She swung her beefy jowls around until she was barely a taco 's length from my face . " Siddown , lady . Or leave . I do n't care which . " I sat . Antsy , I crossed and uncrossed my legs . My shoes stuck to the floor and made an odd sucking noise as I tried to pull them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only newspaper was four days old . I ran my fingers through my hair and contemplated the gouges in the wooden floor , trying not to think about what could be making it so sticky . I stared at the policewoman , wondering how much tighter her LAPD uniform would be after that taco . She caught my eye and sat back heavily in her chair , chewing thoughtfully on the taco and gazing at my Manolos . I got up and approached the desk . " Listen , this is all a misunderstanding , " I said , trying to sound calm and friendly . " Please , please tell me where my husband is . " She shrugged without putting down the taco . " Do n't really know . " " Your detectives have the wrong person . He does n't know anything about what they 're investigating . " " Heard that one before . " She laughed through her nose and took another big bite . " No , really . " I took a deep breath , trying to win her over . Maybe if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . " My husband is Dr. Dan Fields . Maybe you 've heard of him ? " " Nope . " " He 's a plastic surgeon . He 's in the newspapers a lot . " Impress her , but still sound modest . " Actually , he 's pretty well known . " " Right . Everybody in L.A. 's so important . I 'll add him to my list . Let me guess  --  your husband gives second-rate actresses first-rate boobs . " " Not at all , " I said , slightly offended . Then , trying to get back on her good side , I added , " Actually , he spends most of his time doing reconstructive surgery on people who 've been seriously hurt . " " Yeah ? So he 's a good guy ? " She looked up , vaguely interested . I nodded eagerly . " A very good guy . He does facial reconstructions and skin grafts on burn victims . Last week he reattached a teenager 's finger after a car accident , and the boy 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacrosse . Whichever he did before , I ca n't remember , " I said , talking faster and faster . " Oh , and cleft palates . Did I tell you about cleft palates ? Two years ago Dan went to Chile and started a free clinic and taught all the doctors there how to do the surgery . He 's so good , really good . " I paused in the midst of my rant  --  running out of breath and coming to my senses at almost the same time . If the cop wanted Dan 's rsum , she could click onto his website . But probably all she wanted was to finish her shift and go home to her own husband  --  whose fingers were all attached , and who was n't in jail tonight . I kicked off my shoes and sunk about four inches . The cold tile floor of the police station stung my bare feet . " Look , " I said , " my feet hurt . I have blisters . My husband 's back there somewhere when he should n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this to be over . What do you think I should do ? " " Go home , Mrs. Fields . " For a moment , I wondered how the taco lady had managed to say that without moving her lips from her synchronous chewing . Then I realized that the voice was from the other side of the room , and I got into my shoes again and spun around to see Detective Reese standing there . From across the room , he looked a little like Jimmy Smits in his NYPD Blue days , but there was a hardness around his eyes that no actor could simulate . " I 'm not going home without my husband , " I said firmly . " I 'm afraid you 'll have to . " The detective gave me a lazy , contemptuous smile . " He 's been arrested , ma'am . Not going anywhere until his arraignment . " " Which is when ? " " Within forty-eight hours , usually . " " Forty-eight hours ? That 's two days . " I was seething , trying not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " " Oh no ? Tell it to the judge , as the saying goes . But just to calm you down , a good lawyer can probably get the case heard in the morning . " " Ca n't we get it heard right now ? " I asked , picturing the dank cell where Dan was probably cowering right this minute . " I do n't think we could find a judge who 'd consider this an emergency worth getting up for . " " So why did you arrest him at midnight ? He told you he 'd try to help you out in the morning . He does n't know anything about this case . This woman . Whoever she is . " Again , the contemptuous smile . " We knew where we could find him at night . Now as I said , Mrs. Fields , you 'd better leave . Your husband is being photographed and fingerprinted and we 're running a check on his criminal record . " " He does n't have a criminal record , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday because it was my fault . Dan always puts in plenty of quarters . He 's the most honest man you 've ever met . " Reese cleared his throat . " Then he 'll have a clean rap sheet . " He turned and began strolling away , but his studied casualness was interrupted by a door flying open and a commotion erupting in his face as two cops dragged in a grotesquely bloodied creature , barely recognizable as human . Howling like an animal , he flailed his emaciated arms and legs , then collapsed in a heap , quite literally at Reese 's feet . Reese tried to step back , but two blood-caked hands grabbed at his ankles . " Let go ! " Reese hollered , but the man 's own wailing drowned out the words , and suddenly the other two cops descended on him with nightsticks , beating him away from Reese . Blood spurted onto the floor and Reese leaped away as the other cops pinned their prey . The howls changed in intensity from plaintive to pained , and the dissipated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the table for a seventh-grade biology class . " Get him to the back , " Reese yelled , and with stunning viciousness , the cops yanked their victim out the opposite door , in the very direction I 'd been staring since I arrived . " No ! " I shrieked , running after them . " My husband 's back there ! " The door slammed with a convincing thud , locking in the bloodied , the victimized , and the criminal . I crashed against the handle with wild fury , but a lock had snapped into place , and nothing budged . I kicked at the door with the piercing high heel of my left mule , pounding until something seemed to give , but it was the heel , which I felt break away from the sole , dangling like a half-amputated limb . Reese . Maybe he had a human side . Tears streaming down my cheeks , I twisted around to face him . I would have thrown myself at his feet if I thought it would help  --  but I 'd just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need you to help me . Whatever you can do , just get my husband out of there . Please , I beg you . " My terrified plea ricocheted around the squad room with such high-pitched anguish that Reese actually stopped in his tracks and turned slowly to look at me . He blinked a few times , as if trying to figure out who I could be . " I ca n't release your husband , " he said finally . " He 's in jail . A very serious crime , okay ? " " No , it 's not okay ! Please do n't lock him up all night ! " Maybe the room turned humans into wild animals , because my bellows suddenly sounded identical to the cries of the creature who had just been dragged away . Reese did n't bother answering me this time ; he just disappeared out the door where he had first come . Despite my broken shoe , I charged after him , but the taco cop stood up with more speed than I would have thought possible and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady . Nobody leaves this area . " " I 've got to help my husband , " I said , my voice suddenly shaking . " Ya not gon na help him here . " An edge of sympathy had crept in under her Brooklyn accent . " Look , just get home . Come back first thing in the morning . " " Do you think Dan 's in a cell with ... " I gestured vaguely , indicating the wild man who had just come in . " Nah . That was probably a drug charge . Your husband 's in on murder . Much bigger deal . Probably in seclusion . " My shoe chose that moment to give up completely , the torn heel collapsing and my ankle twisting as I sunk to the floor . My husband was more dangerous than a bloody , drug-crazed maniac . I got up and without another word half crawled , half stumbled to my car . Driving home , I wanted to think out the situation properly , preparing for constructive action , but instead I kept hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in jail ! Dan 's in jail ! Dan 's in jail ! like some endlessly repeated child 's tape from the Brothers Grimm . My only images of jail came from TV shows and bad DVDs : I pictured a hostile cell mate , a smelly toilet , and a shaky , lice-infested cot . I tried not to think about the worst  --  Dan the doctor being beaten up by some nothing-left-to-lose killer , who 'd turn his face into a bloody pulp and force needles into his arm . The highway was empty and I revved the motor , driving eighty most of the way home . Forget the treadmill  --  my personal best tonight was going to be set in the car . I half hoped I 'd get stopped so I could tell my story to some other cop , but nobody came near me . Maybe all the cops in L.A. were busy arresting innocent people tonight . Back inside the house , I peeked in on Jimmy , but his bed was empty . I dashed down the hall to Ashley 's room  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the foot of her bed like some loyal golden retriever . I carried him gently back , grateful that he did n't wake up . Making a final stop in Grant 's room , I found my oldest son also asleep , his long hair flung across the pillow , a small silver earring glinting in the moonlight that crept in from the edges of the shade . He looked like a Hollywood surfer boy , but under the golden tan was a smart student who had a physics midterm tomorrow . I somehow had to get him off to school in the morning without prattling on hysterically about the police . No use upsetting him before his test . With college applications coming , he needed good grades , and nothing mattered more . I took a deep breath . Nothing mattered more ? If only . Whether Grant ended up at Stanford or Swarthmore suddenly did n't seem as serious as Dan 's ending up at Sing Sing . Heading back to my own bedroom , I decided I 'd try Jack again at 6:30 A.M. or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an early-morning town . I lay down on the bed , trying to muster the energy to undress and wash my face , but instead I just closed my eyes . And then opened them again . Who cared about the time ? With my husband stuck in a cell , I could n't worry about waking his lawyer . I fumbled in my closet for a pair of no-blister Hogans to replace the broken-heeled mules , then crept quietly down the stairs and back to my Lexus . Jack lived in Beverly Hills , just north of Sunset on elegant Roxbury Drive , and at this hour , zipping along at a conservative seventy miles per hour , I was there in ten minutes . A thick hedge of trees blocked the neo-Colonial mansion from the quiet street , but Jack , less pretentious than his neighbors , had no gate . I pulled into the driveway , marched up to the front door , and rang the bell . Nothing . Could they be away ? No , his son attended the same private school as Grant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town in March , during midterms of junior year . I rang again . And again . From where I stood on the front porch , I saw the faint glow of a light going on in a distant window , and then a woman 's voice over the intercom  --  at least theirs worked  --  saying uncertainly , " Who 's there ? " " It 's Lacy Fields . I need Jack . There 's an emergency . " " Lacy ? " The voice  --  Jack 's wife , Gina  --  seemed to perk up . " Hang on , I 'll wake him up . " The intercom went dead long enough for me to wonder if he was a sound sleeper or in a different bed , but then the front door was opening and Jack was there , tying on a thick terry robe . " Geez , Lacy , what 's going on ? Are you all right ? " Jack put his sturdy arm around me , and I felt myself trembling , ready to cry . But I held it together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up again . " I 'm okay , " I said . " But Dan 's in jail . " " What ? " His voice ripped through the quiet night , and I envisioned neighbors bounding up from their beds , thinking they 'd heard a shot . Jack recovered quickly enough to grab my arm and pull me over the threshold , closing the heavy door behind us with a thud . In the dim light of the foyer , he looked at me uncertainly . " I want to hear this . Come on in . Do you need a drink ? Should I have Gina put on some coffee ? " " Just water , " I said . Jack looked dazed , and since he was now dealing with a woman who had shown up unannounced at his doorstep at three in the morning , I could n't really blame him . We walked down a hall , past the sleekly modern dining room , and then Jack flipped on an overhead light in the kitchen . Gina had been calling me for months to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renovation . She had a good eye herself , and now that the kitchen was finished , I could practically picture Martha Stewart coming in to whip up some cream puffs . Good manners demanded I rave about the stainless steel stove and free-form granite counters , but in my current state , I simply was n't capable of making kind comments about custom cabinetry . Jack opened the refrigerator and pulled out a bottle of lemon Poland Spring . " What do you mean Dan 's in jail ? " he asked , saving me from any small talk . I took a deep breath . " Short version or long ? " " Short . " " Two cops showed up at midnight , crashed through the house to find Dan , and then put handcuffs on him . One of them drew a gun and pointed it right at him . " I started shaking , my voice quavering at the memory . I sniffled a couple of times and put my fingers over my lips to stop the trembling . " They took him down to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they locked him up . They wo n't let me see him . " Jack , still holding on to the Poland Spring , wandered over to the other side of the kitchen and slid onto a bar stool . I followed him like a puppy . " What 's the charge ? " I tried to form the word , but my lips would n't do it . Instead , a shudder went through my whole body . " Some woman named Tasha Barlow , " I whispered . Jack furrowed his brow . " She 's bringing charges against Dan ? What are we talking about here , Lacy ? Harassment ? Sexual harassment ? " I felt my cheeks getting warm , but I just shook my head . Jack thought he was helping , offering the most dramatic charge he could imagine so I could just nod and not have to say the words . " Worse , " I said , my voice barely a croak . " She 's dead . " Now Jack glowered at me as if I 'd started spouting obscenities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was loud , and it was all I could do not to cover my ears so I did n't have to hear him . I offered a barely perceptible nod and felt my eyes fill up with tears . " There 's an arraignment within forty-eight hours . But the cop said maybe we could get it in the morning . " " Jesus Christ . You know I 'm not the one to handle this , Lacy . " " So tell me who is . " " Dave Liggett comes to mind . He 's defended a couple of big sex suits lately . " " And you 're thinking what ? " " I do n't know . False accusations by a woman . This Tasha Barlow ... " He paused and shook his head . " Forgive me , I 'm not completely awake . I guess if she 's dead she 's not making any false accusations against Dan . Those had to come from somewhere else . " " Of course . False accusations . That 's what 's going on . Or mistaken identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That Dan could be anything less than one hundred percent innocent had n't yet crossed my mind . " Chauncey Howell , " Jack said suddenly , snapping his fingers " Best criminal lawyer I know . The best . " I liked the name . He sounded like he was from an old New England family , the kind that sailed over on the Mayflower . " Can I call him now ? " Jack did n't bother to look at a clock , he just picked up the cordless phone on the counter and punched in a number . We both waited . " Chauncey ? Jack Rosenfeld . Sorry to get you at this hour on your private line . But I need your help on a murder case . " Murder case . Uttered coldly into the phone in the middle of the night , the words hit me like exploding land mines . I clutched my chest and reeled back . With panic rising , I grabbed my bag and pulled out my cell phone . Jack , done outlining the situation to Chauncey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't need your mobile , " he said . " You can talk to Chauncey on this line . " Jack held out the receiver , but instead of taking it , I frantically pushed the menu buttons on my Motorola until the small screen displayed my cache of digital photos . Dan hugging me at the beach . Dan and Jimmy lying on the grass . Dan playing tennis with Ashley . Dan  --  my husband who could n't be a murderer . He 'd eaten lasagna tonight with me and the kids , said I looked sexy in my workout clothes , and kissed me gently before he got into our antique four-poster bed . I snapped my cell phone shut . Next time I was able to curl up next to Dan , I 'd know that according to the cops , I was sleeping with a killer .
