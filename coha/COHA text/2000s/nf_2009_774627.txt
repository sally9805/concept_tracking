* Socket to Me // Yesterday made the twentieth day that I have been tossing about upon the sea . The winds and waves have taken me all the way from the Ogyian island , and now fate has flung me upon this coast . //  --  Homer , The Odyssey // Years ago , back when i still had only two cats , i was fond of saying that if I ever adopted a third I would name him Meow Tse-tung and call him " The Chairman " for short . // " Do n't look at me like that , it 'll be cute , " I would insist when my friends regarded me as if I were a loon . " Little Chairman Meow. " // The joke was twofold : the name itself , and also the idea that I would adopt a third cat . I might never have taken the monumental step ( so it had seemed to me at twenty-four ) of adopting two except that I 'd been living for three years with Jorge , the man I was sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I had gained custody of our feline offspring  --  a sweet-tempered , fluffy white beauty named Vashti and a regal , moody gray tabby named Scarlett . I was grateful for my two girls every day , but also painfully aware of the potential complications they would create in my newly single life , complications I had never contemplated back in the days when I 'd thought Jorge and I would be together forever . // I was staying in a friend 's spare bedroom while I tried to save up for an affordable place to live , for example , but I would never be able to move into a more reasonably priced pet-free building . There was no point in even considering a relationship with a man who had cat allergies . I worked in nonprofit , running volunteer programs for the United Way of Miami-Dade , and I never had more than fifty dollars in the bank at the end of the month . Nevertheless , routine vaccinations , injuries , and illnesses would have to be paid for by me alone , no matter what their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social implications , " my best friend , Andrea , would say . " I mean , there are only so many cats you can have when you 're twenty-four and single . The neighborhood kids will start calling you Old Widow Cooper and throw rocks at your windows and say things like , That 's where Old Widow Cooper , the cat lady , lives . She 's craaaaazy . . . " // I knew she was right ; I was n't completely out of touch with reality . In my present circumstances , talking about a third cat was an absurd hypothetical , like daydreaming about what I might buy if I won the lottery . // Then one afternoon , a couple of months after Jorge and I broke up , I got a call from Patty , a young veterinarian only three years older than I was , who was the newest member at the practice that treated Scarlett and Vashti . Patty told me a long , sad story that would have been perfect for a cable movie , if only there were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-week-old stray kitten had been abandoned at her office , she said , after a virulent eye infection had required the surgical removal of both his eyes . The couple who had originally brought him in did n't want him . Nor did any of the people on her adoption list , not even the ones who had expressed a specific interest in adopting a handicapped cat . Nobody , it seemed , wanted to face this particular handicap . I was her last call , the last possibility she could think of , before . . . // She did n't finish her sentence , and she did n't have to . I knew there was almost no chance that an eyeless kitten would be adopted from a shelter before his time ran out . // Do n't , warned the Greek chorus that lives inside my head . Yes , it 's sad but , honestly , you 're in no position to do anything about it . // I 'd always been an obsessive reader , a passionate lover of books , and I knew the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like blind , abandoned , unwanted , and orphan was like sending someone armed with a toy rifle into trench warfare . // Still , I recognized the wisdom of my inner Greek chorus , even if I could n't be as coolly analytical as it was . So I said , " I 'll come in and meet him . " I paused . " I 'm not promising anything , though . " // I should note that , prior to this , I had never taken an I 'll meet him and we 'll see attitude when it came to pet adoption . It never occurred to me to meet the pet in question first , to see if he was " special " or whether there was some sort of unique bond between us . My philosophy when it came to pets was much like that of having children : You got what you got , and you loved them unconditionally regardless of whatever their personalities or flaws turned out to be . While I was growing up , my family adopted or fostered numerous dogs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their previous homes . We 'd had dogs who could n't be housebroken , dogs who chewed up carpeting and wallpaper , dogs who dug compulsively under fences or who even occasionally snapped when they were startled . My cats , Scarlett and Vashti , had been adopted a year apart from acquaintances who 'd found them as six-week-old kittens  --  mange-ridden , half starved , and covered in fleas and sores  --  wandering the streets of Miami . I had committed to them sight unseen ; the first time I 'd met them had been the day they 'd come to live with me. // So I felt more than a little dishonest , driving down to my vet 's office the following afternoon . Patty might not know it , but I knew myself well enough to understand that when I 'd said , " I 'll come in and meet him , " what I 'd meant was , I really do n't want a third cat right now , but I 'd feel like a bad person if I gave you a straightforward no after hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room to wriggle off the hook . // " We have to take him . We have to let him live here " had been the immediate response of my roommate , Melissa , when I 'd told her about the blind kitten the night before  --  " here " being Melissa 's one-story , two-bedroom , waterfront South Beach home , where I split the cost of utilities , groceries , and other household expenses while I tried to save up for my own place . But Melissa was beautiful , and an heiress , and the everyday obstacles that appeared insurmountable to me at this juncture in my life were n't even blips on her radar screen . Melissa did n't have to agonize over things like higher vet bills , or being unable to eventually find a home for herself and her brood of three ( three ! ) , or the prospect of being undateable . ( I could already hear imaginary conversations among these mythical men I had n't even met yet  --  let alone started dating . Dude , she 's smart , she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's got three cats ! That 's just messed up , dude. ) // I could n't decide if I was even the right person for a kitten like this , a kitten who would undoubtedly have special needs I could n't begin to anticipate . What if he never learned to get around on his own ? What if my other two cats hated him on sight and made his life miserable ? What if I simply was n't up to the challenge of taking care of him ? I could barely take care of myself . Arguably , given that I was living in somebody else 's home at the moment , I could n't take care of myself . // I 'd been encouraged , briefly , by Melissa 's use of the word we . I would n't be in this alone . In some small , crafty corner of my brain , it occurred to me that I could bring the kitten home and , if I proved unequipped to handle him , Melissa could always . . . // " Of course , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Melissa had added a moment later , " because he 'll go with you when you move out . " // The thing that was speeding me toward my vet 's office as surely as the wheels and motor of the car I was driving , the thing that had gotten me to agree to meet this kitten in the first place , was guilt . If I did n't take him , no one would . I had always been an easy mark when it came to animals and everybody knew it . I was a veteran weekend volunteer at Miami 's various animal shelters , and  --  back when Jorge and I were still living together  --  I 'd always come home in tears , pleading with him against all reason to consider adopting one of the dogs or cats who stood to be euthanized if nobody stepped forward . My only run-in with the law thus far had been the time , in college , when I 'd been arrested at a protest rally outside of my university 's primate research center . I 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I would give them all the food out of my lunchbox , without considering how I planned to feed myself at lunchtime . // And it was exactly this kind of hazy , immature thinking , I told myself somewhat viciously as I slid into the parking lot outside my vet 's office , this heedless disregard for future consequences , that had landed me exactly where I currently was in life  --  broke and alone after years of carefully constructing what I 'd thought was an unshakable future . // I realize now that I was trying to manufacture a sense of anger . It was far easier to convince myself I was angry and put-upon than it was to admit I was terrified . // It was a ferociously muggy , late-August day . Silvery waves of heat shimmered and rose like evil genies from the pavement fronting the strip mall where my vet had her office . The receptionist greeted me warmly as I entered , summoning Patty , who popped her head out from a door behind the reception desk with a cheerful " Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cages holding cats and dogs , which I 'd noticed before but never paid much attention to . I 'd always assumed they 'd been left in the temporary care of my vet by owners who would eventually come to retrieve them . For the first time , I wondered how many of them were actually homeless , waiting to be looked over by people like me who might or might not end up adopting them . // We reached the last examination room at the end of a narrow , wood-paneled corridor , and Patty opened the door for me . On the exam table was a lidless plastic box ( " So you can interact with him , " she explained ) . I walked over and peered in. // He 's so tiny was my first thought . Both of my cats had been almost this young when I 'd taken them in , but I 'd forgotten how absolutely tiny a four-week-old kitten is . He could n't have weighed more than a few ounces . He had curled himself up into a miniature sphere in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have fit easily into the palm of my hand . His fur was all black , and it had that static-electricity fluffiness that very small kittens have , as if their fur has actively rebelled against the notion of lying flat . Where his eyes had been were two tiny stitches , and around his neck was one of those plastic cones they put on pets to keep them from scratching stitches out . // " I sutured the lids shut , " Patty said . " So it wo n't look like he has sockets or anything  --  it 'll kind of look like he has his eyes closed all the time . " She was right . Looking at the X-shaped stitches where his eyes would have been , I was reminded of childhood cartoons where the drunkenness or demise of a character was indicated by X 's drawn over his eyes . // " Hey there , " I said softly . I scrunched down a bit , so my voice would come from the kitten 's level and not sound too booming or scary . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the corner of the box uncurled itself and stood up hesitantly . I tentatively reached a hand  --  a hand that suddenly seemed monstrous in size  --  into the box and lightly scratched the bottom of it . The kitten walked slowly toward the sound , his head bobbing uncertainly under the weight of the plastic cone . His nose bumped against one of my fingers , and he sniffed it curiously . // I glanced up at Patty , who said , " You can pick him up if you want to . " // I lifted him carefully , cradling him just below my chest with one hand supporting his bottom and the other around his chest and front legs . " Hi , little boy , " I whispered . // At the sound of my voice , he turned himself around and reached up to my left shoulder with his front paws ; they were so small , they sank between the cables of the light cotton sweater I was wearing . He struggled a bit , and I could tell he was trying to hoist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as they were , were too tiny to get a good grip . Giving up , he twisted again and brought his face as close to where my jaw met my neck as the plastic cone would allow . He tried to rub his face against mine , although all I felt was plastic against my cheek . Then he started to purr . The cone funneled the sound until it was so loud , he sounded like an improbably small motor . // I had expected that , having no eyes , he would be incapable of conveying much expression  --  and it occurred to me that this , perhaps , was the secret fear of the people who 'd refused to adopt him . A pet whose face could n't register love , could n't reflect emotion , might always feel like a stranger in your home . // As I held him , though , I realized that it is n't the eyes that tell you how someone is feeling or what they 're thinking . It 's the muscles around the eyes , which pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the edges to convey amusement or narrow them into slits indicating anger . // This kitten did n't have his eyes anymore , but the muscles around them had been left intact . And I could tell , from the shape the muscles were taking , that if he 'd had eyelids they would have been half closed in an expression eminently familiar to me from my other two cats . It was an expression of utter contentment . The ease with which he slipped into it suggested that , despite everything he 'd already been through  --  despite every reason he 'd had to expect the opposite  --  in the depths of his kitten-y little soul , he 'd always known there would be a place where he could feel completely warm and secure . // And now , at last , he 'd found it . // " Oh , for God 's sake . " I put him gently back into his box , then rooted around in my purse for a tissue . // " Wrap him up , I 'm taking him home . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her a little while longer . She wanted to keep an eye on his stitches , concerned about possible infections . And she also hoped he might gain some weight before being subjected to the tender mercies of solid food and two full-grown cats . " You can take him home in a few days , " she promised . // I was finally getting my Chairman Meow , but somehow a prefab name did n't seem right anymore . " You should call him Socket , " Melissa suggested . // " That 's awful ! " I exclaimed . " His name is not Socket ! " // She shrugged good-naturedly . " He 'll always be Socket to me. " //
