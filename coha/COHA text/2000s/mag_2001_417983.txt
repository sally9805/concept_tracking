Catholics need facts to vote their faith THE AUGUST INTERVIEW WITH FATHER MICHAEL Baxter , C.S.C. ( " In the world but not of it " ) was thought-provoking , although I was disappointed with at least one of his answers . Baxter claims that Catholics vote more for their party than for anything related to their faith . I think not . What I see happening , at least here in this part of the country , is that devout Catholics are trying to vote their faith . Far too often , however , it does not extend beyond the abortion question . This is so true that some persons , writing letters to the local diocesan newspaper , claim that it is sinful to vote for anyone who is prochoice . So a candidate who claims to be prolife can get many Catholic votes from people who never realize that sometimes that candidate is also for the death penalty , for more spending on the military and less on the poor , and , more encroachment on the rights and needs of others in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's probably because social justice aspects of their faith have not been articulated as clearly as the abortion issue has . " // If Catholics do not vote their faith , it 's probably because social justice aspects of their faith have not been articulated as clearly as the abortion issue has . What we really need are Catholic leaders in our churches who are willing to take on the hard questions such as war , poverty , hunger , the death penalty , and injustices committed by our country around the world , instead of merely encouraging personal piety and feelgood religion . Lucy Fuchs Brandon , Fla . Baxter criticizes the 1983 pastoral letter on peace of the U.S. Catholic bishops . He claims , it ( 1 ) did not put out a distinctively Christian vision on war and peace ; ( 2 ) failed to shape the minds of Catholic voters ; and ( 3 ) did not have the intended impact on national policy leaders . A careful sociological study by Father Andrew Greeley came to the conclusion that it had a more profound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement ever made by the U.S. bishops . It and similar statements made by religious leaders in other countries helped bring the world back from the brink of nuclear disaster . So profound was the change in attitudes of national policy leaders that by the time of the Reykjavik conference in 1986 , Gorbachev and Reagan came very close to the elimination of nuclear weapons . The Challenge of Peace was influential , in part , because of the way in which it was prepared , which permitted and encouraged public discussion of it during the drafting process . As the person who suggested this procedure to Bishop Murphy and Cardinal Bernardin , I am proud to have had a small part in producing a document which may not have been what critics like Baxter would like to have seen , but which achieved far more than even its most ardent proponents had dared to hope for . John N. Snell Baltimore , Md . In good company " Who 's working for peace now ? " Robert Keeler answered that question brilliantly in the lead article of the August issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same article with great peacemakers and peace-seeking organizations such as Father Roy Bourgeois , Philip Berrigan , Elizabeth McAlister , the School of the Americas Watch , and Gordon Zahn ( one of Pax Christi USA 's Ambassadors of Peace ) , among others . As outgoing national coordinator of Pax Christi USA , I was especially pleased that Keeler devoted so much of his article to Pax Christi USA 's mission and some of its more recent initiatives . Thank you for a thought-provoking article . Nancy Small , Former National Coordinator , Pax Christi USA Erie , Pa . For it is in giving that we receive While the title of the August Reader Survey by Mary Lynn Hendrickson ( " What do you get out of Mass ? " ) is understandable , I would rather ask , " What is it that we give to the Mass when we gather to celebrate it ? " If we take Jesus at his word and believe that we only keep what we give away , then this would apply when we gather for the Eucharist as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we gather at the Eucharist , we must focus on " How can I help this assembly better celebrate this Eucharist ? " All of this springs out of the conviction that the priest-presider is not the lone " celebrant " of the Eucharist , but that the entire assembly has gathered to celebrate the Eucharist . We will turn the corner on well-celebrated Eucharists when we enable our assemblies first of all to realize they are the celebrants of the Eucharist , that each has a gift to bring to it , that each is responsible for the Eucharist they have gathered to celebrate . It is then that they ( we ) will get something out of the Mass . Father james Friedel , O.S.A. Olympia Fields , Ill . While reading the August Reader Survey , I kept trying to picture a similar survey directed at Protestants or fundamentalists . Would there be responses like : " All that arm-waving makes my shoulders ache , " " Let 's cut the sermons down to an hour , " or " Those tedious altar calls should be limited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I was amazed , too , at the number of references to post-Vatican II changes . Vatican II ended in 1965 . Since then an entire generation has reached late middle age , and their children are in college . Yes , the Mass is in English now , and the priest faces the congregationlet 's get over it , please . There are also two precious miracles that Catholics should call to mind each week : ( 1 ) At this Mass the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ will become physically present . ( 2 ) Two thousand years ago Jesus told his followers to " Do this in remembrance of me . " We have done just that . Larry Hippler Richland , Wash . Give me Grandma 's religion I read Kathleen Chesto 's article ( " This is not your father 's religion , " August ) , and while I agreed with a few points , I took offense at most of what she had to say . Chesto 's theories on why young people have increasingly fallen away from the church misses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic , I only started going to church when my grandfather passed away . My grandmother , unable to drive , asked me to take her . It became a Sunday ritual , from the time I turned 17 until her death this year . Grandma preferred going to her old inner-city parish , where the interior was 19th-century Gothic , not 1980s suburban-modern . I loved it . Moreover , the Mass was said in Latin . The chants and the organ , and all the rituals that Chesto scoffs at as old-fashioned , really appealed to me . I liked the fact that I could surrender myself to the service , fall into my own meditation , and reflect and pray without having to participate in prescribed refrains and handshakes . I liked the elevation and sacredness of the Latin service . The only thing I can say in agreement with Chesto is that , yes , her generation is to blame for the sinking attendance . In an attempt to make religion fit your views of soft , contemporary suburban culture , you took away an important element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysticism , sacredness , something higher . Charles Zuneffi Trenton , N.J. A lesson and a blessing I read with great interest the article " Borderline Christianity " by Moises Sandoval ( June ) . Along with Father Stan Martinka of San Alfonso Mission , I too am involved with outreach in Juarez , Mexico . Southern Exposure is a nonprofit corporation that has enabled hundreds of North Americans to participate in immersion and house-building projects in Juarez . Folks commit one week of their time , fund their transportation to El Paso , and a portion of the construction costs of a cinderblock house , and contribute their talent and love . These Christian missionaries are lodged and fed in the Southern Exposure house in Juarez ( Casa de Esperanza ) by the locals . Thirty-seven houses have been constructed in the last year . The youngest missioner was 7 and the oldest 72 . All the volunteers have been transformed . We are blessed to be part of developing those relationships while learning from the reality of the people of Ciudad Juarez . Michael J. Howard Arvada , Colo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
