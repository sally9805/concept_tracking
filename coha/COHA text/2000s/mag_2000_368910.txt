After winning a beauty contest at age 15 , Tallulah Bankhead moved to New York City , where she became an actress , as well as an attractive side dish at the Algonquin Round Table . She created some legendary stage roles  --  Regina in The Little Foxes , Sabina in The Skin of Our Teeth  --  though Hollywood never really took to her ( Hitchcock used her best in Lifeboat ) . <P> Most people today remember her , if they remember her at all , for that husky , bourbon-soaked voice and her outsize personality ( " Dahhhling " ) , emblems of a kind of theatrical glamour that was even then going out of style .

In Dahling we watch her throw wild ' 20s parties , experiment with cocaine and bisexuality , and toss off one of her more famous quips from the bathroom .
