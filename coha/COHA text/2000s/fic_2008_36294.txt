Bram Stoker 's Journal <p> Monday , 12 March 1888.  --  Out on the streets , it seemed wise to hide the bloodied knife . <p> I 'd preserved that much sense ; but just why I 'd brought the knife with me , I can not say . Better to have left it back in the hotel , or to have hidden it in the theatre where last we 'd used it . But no , here it was in hand , and reddened , and yes , rather hard to hide : the convex blade bends eight steely inches to its tip , and the hilt is carved in the Nepalese style . Once seen , this knife is not to be forgotten . <p> The hilt protruded from my pocket . I tried to hide it in the hollow of my ruined hand . The blade-tip itself pushed through the pocket 's bottom , like a spring shoot eager for the end of this Manhattan winter , the worst in living memory . And so it must have seemed , as I stumbled down Fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife , put its blade to purpose on some passerby ; but no , no indeed . <p> Mad ? Maybe I was . But the only knives I have known heretofore are of that spring-loaded species common to the stage . The kind that give upon contact with actorly flesh , the bashful blade retracting to conceal itself in the hilt . But this knife , my knife , is another type entirely ; for Henry will not hear of props upon the stage . Reality is all , says he ; and his Shylock , when nightly he begs his rightful pound of flesh from Antonio , lays a real blade , lays this blade upon his bared chest . Yes : Reality is all . <p> That : a pound of flesh , as scripted by the bard . This : a gallon of my own gore . <p> Had the knife sought the All of Me , sought to set the All of Me to running red ? Had I sought it myself ? No knife knows a will of its own ; . . . but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask because , if not . . . Alas , I dare not write the word begged by so rash an act . I shall leave its sinful S steaming , unspoken , upon my tongue . I shall not trade ink for blood and name the act here . No . But the blood , yes , all the eager blood , drip drip dripping through the mean tourniquet I 'd tied , dripping down to the knife 's tip to drip drip drip onto the new-fallen snow of Fifth Avenue : a red trail to betray my wandering way , to betray me as my own hand had a half-hour earlier . <p> No more scratch now . Let this suffice . My left and penless hand throbs in sympathy with this , my ruined right ; and so I close . The blade I have scrubbed of its blood , but the body knows no such ready repair . Nor does the soul . And so what can I do but embrace this pain as my penance ? <p> Whatever did I mean to do ? And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stoker to Hall Caine <p> 19 March 1888 <p> My Dearest Hommy-Beg , <p> I 've much to apprise you of , old friend , as Life 's pendulum has swung of late to the bad ; for damned I am if the Black Hounds are not hot upon my heels . <p> I write whilst training to West Point with all the Company , and whilst profiting from the peace afforded me by the Guv'nor 's shunning me at present.As the Lyceum herd follows his lead , I am spared having to see to their manifold needs as well . Though of course it fell to yours truly to arrange this 8 a.m. special from Madison Square on which we  --  players , scenery , costumery , &amp;c.  --  chug toward the military academy . And no mean feat that , may I say , as still New York , as still all the eastern seaboard sits snowbound . Indeed , so desperate is the citizenry to locomote that some stand at the side of these very rails on which we ride , hailing our train as if it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aforementioned herd I exempt dearest Ellen.It is she alone with whom I share this car , hence the rare peace I reference ; for E.T . sits staring out over the snowscape , lost to the present save when she slips a treat into the mouth of her Drummie , the treasured terrier upon her lap . A sidelong glance at her impossibly fine profile tells me she " rehearses " at present : no doubt it is Portia she plays within , as it is The Merchant of Venice we will play tonight for the assembled cadets . <p> Alas , though I need not describe to you , Caine , those dank cellars to which the mind and soul do sometimes descend  --  you 've suffered so long your own mullygrubs and glooms  --  I shall address a few particulars of my own descent . Catharsis , may I call it ? Confession ? Regardless , I must begin by begging your pardon for the fearful state of this letter . On tour I have even less time to myself than in London , and if I set this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair copy , well , it would be many more days till you heard from your old friend Stoker . So I shall post this in time , saying now do not mind the stains.Yes , they are bloodstains . And yes , it is my blood , accidentally shed . So I hope . And so I 'd pray , if prayer availed me still . <p> Surely I must beg pardon , too , of my penmanship . The train knocks this nib about , yes , but this scribble is more attributable to the mummified state of my left hand . It is bandaged and cross-bound from forearm to fingertip . The thumb is splinted so as to help its nearly-severed tendon heal . My four fingers stick out from the white swaddling like spring shoots from snow . And my right hand , my writing hand , seems to suffer in sympathy ; hence this horrid scrawl . <p> The blood , yes ; quite a flow came . And I am quite lucky to  --  <p> <br> Continues ...        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
