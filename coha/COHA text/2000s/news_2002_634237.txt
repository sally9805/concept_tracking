<p> Carrie Secrist is beautiful . And not just beautiful in some generic , highly symmetric features kind of way , either . She 's got that sweet , healthy , blond kind of beauty that makes you think she probably did a lot of horseback riding as a girl . ( She did . ) <p> She is also polite and good-natured enough not to make too big a deal of what a pain in the ass the whole beauty thing can be , the way you 're supposed to act like it does n't matter , the way you have to act surprised  --  beautiful ? me ?  --  when people bring it up . <p> " All my artists want me to dress better , " says Secrist , the 33-year-old owner of River North 's hippest gallery . Secrist has two looks : black turtleneck , black mini skirt and very high black heels , or grubby jeans and no shoes . The skirt is for selling art ; the jeans are for hanging it on the walls . <p> When I arrive at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed to sell . But her jeans are in the back . She is in the middle of installing a new show , titled " None of Your Beeswax . " It 's the kind of show for which the gallery has become famous : quirky enough to be memorable , substantial enough to be worth seeing . Naturally , it features work from three artists  --  a sculptor , a painter and a collage artist  --  who work with wax . Though not in her comfortable clothes , she continues to move things around and displays the impressive ability to climb a stepladder in heels . <p> Secrist 's mother , Karen West , is sitting in the gallery 's office , having dropped in because she happened to be downtown . And while many of us might be a little taken aback if Mom showed up at our offices , Secrist is utterly nonplussed , even happy about it . <p> " We 're very close , as you can see , " Secrist says . <p> While her daughter puts on her black-and-white checkered wool coat and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , funny Russian hat , " West shows me a beautiful seascape , painted by Hiro Yokose , that will be featured in the exhibition . The beeswax Yokose has glazed over the oil paint gives the piece the almost-pearly sheen of a mist over water . <p> " It 's Lake Michigan , " West says , but Secrist shoots her a quick , sharp look and she adds , " I always say that in Chicago . In California , I tell people it 's the Pacific . " <p> West declines an invitation to join us , so we head out to the neighborhood spot Secrist has chosen for lunch . It 's Club Lago , right down the block . As we walk in , the owner , GianCarlo , greets Secrist with a kiss on the cheek and shows us to one of the " reserved " tables right by the bar . Lago , where the air is thick with the smells of vinyl seats and last night 's cigarettes and this afternoon 's marinara sauce , seems exactly opposite the kind of place where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , is exactly why they all love it . <p> " I 've seen many a sad art dealer here washing away their worries , " says Secrist , who thinks of the place as a slightly funkier version of Cheers . <p> Substitute a gallery owner for a postal worker and red wine for beer and I guess that gets you there . If everyone is also very thin and attractive . And they smoke and wear great clothes . <p> " It 's seemingly this glamorous , fun business , " Secrist says , admitting that her life is probably closer to " Sex and the City " than " Cheers , " " but you get to a point where the openings , outfits and parties really become a nuisance . And the thing is , there is a lot of schlepping , constantly keeping track of the work and getting it where it needs to be . And , if you happen to mention what you do , everyone has a sister , brother or cousin whose work you just have to see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's in insurance sales , simply to avoid a lengthy conversation about the remarkable sculptures somebody 's niece is making entirely out of used car parts . Unfortunately , she does n't know much about insurance , so she has to be careful . Also , she just does n't look like someone who spends a lot of time debating the relative merits of whole vs. term life policies . <p> After studying painting at Miami University of Ohio  --  not such a good choice of schools , she says , but , at the time , having a football team seemed like an important qualification for a college  --  Secrist realized she had a gift for talking about art , but not so much for creating it . <p> " It 's frustrating , " she says , " when you have a vision , but you ca n't do it . You get angry at your hand for not doing it . " <p> Though she might be a failed artist  --  she 's kept only one of her paintings and wo n't show it to me  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an art dealer . The fact that she is beautiful seems somehow to add credibility to her aesthetic tastes . People want to know her and to buy whatever she sells . <p> Secrist is one of those people who happens to know absolutely everyone . She occasionally drops names , but not in a name-droppy sort of way . She just kind of assumes that you 've partied with Hef , too . And she 'd probably feel bad if you told her you had n't . There 's a perfectly logical , **45;1918;TOOLONG quality to all her celebrity encounter stories . Most of them involve her longtime boyfriend , writer Bill Zehme , who was , for a time , the " authorized biographer " of Playboy magnate Hugh Hefner . That deal , Secrist says , " went south , " but Zehme continues to work on celebrity profiles for magazines and TV shows . <p> They 've been dating for six years now and she says it 's probably time to move things to " another level . " But what that means , she does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first and I was n't ready , " she says , " but now I 'm officially the last single person I know . " <p> Secrist takes her spaghetti with meatballs , her Diet Coke with ice and her coffee with artificial sweetener . She tries to take a pretty laid-back approach to most things , or at least to act as if she does , striking the pose of the fortunate amateur . <p> " I 'm not really into the hard sell , " she says , describing her relationship to the collectors who buy art from her gallery . " Basically , if you like it and you have the money . . . . " <p> It 's the sort of thing you say to make other people think your job is easy , and to half-apologize for it before they can tell you how lucky you are . Secrist does a lot of that . She has to . She was only 23 when she opened her own gallery , an artsy It Girl with a great eye and a generous sponsor . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says now , " because I thought , ' Who would buy anything from a 23-year-old ? ' That was 10 years ago in November , so , now , for all intents and purposes , I 'm 43 . " <p> After only one year in operation , the business , then called Gallery A , was so successful that Secrist was able to buy out the original sponsor . Now it 's one of the top 10 galleries in the city in terms of sales and probably No. 1 in terms of buzz . Secrist has a knack for putting together shows that grab attention . Whether it 's a catchy title  --  like " None of Your Beeswax "  --  or a great ad like the one for the humor-themed exhibit that featured Secrist wearing a red foam clown nose , Secrist 's exhibitions always manage to find a way to stand out . It 's smart business , of course , but also something that comes pretty naturally for a woman who owns , and regularly wears , a giant black fur hat . <p> @ @ @
