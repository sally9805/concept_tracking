From The Corps of the Bare-Boned Plane Almost immediately I had a closer relationship to the island than I had to either my uncle or my cousin . The island with its wind and waves and pounding rain seemed alive . I was n't so sure about Uncle Marten or Jocelyn . They were remote in different ways . Jocelyn remained cold and contained and Uncle Marten was never around except at dinner . We ate dinner every night at a long table that sat twenty . I sat at one end , Jocelyn in the middle , and my uncle at the other end . Uncle Marten made the same thing every night , hot dogs and mac and cheese . We ate it silently in the drafty dining room with the roar of the fire in the large hearth in the living room , the sound of the ubiquitous wind in the eaves and the rain hitting the windows . Jocelyn cut her hot dogs up with her knife and fork , even the bun , and ate them in tiny , neat pieces . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My uncle always brought a book down to the table and would read and take notes and then wish us good evening and go to bed . I was n't sure if he thought that he was being tactful , allowing us the luxury of silence in our grief , or if he regarded us as birds that had accidentally landed in the house and about which he was too distracted to do anything . IfUncle Marten was disturbed by his brothers ' deaths he did n't seem to let it interfere with his work .
