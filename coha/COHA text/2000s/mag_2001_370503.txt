Getting a patient 's bill of rights he prefers just became tougher for President Bush because he strung along his friend , G.O.P. Congressman Charlie Norwood . When Democrat John Edwards introduced such a bill in the Senate last February , the White House opposed it largely because it let patients sue their HMOs for up to $5 million . The Administration got Norwood to hold off sponsoring a nearly identical bill in the House , promising to strike a compromise . Imagine his surprise when he found that Bush aides had secretly written a bill more to their liking with G.O.P. Senator Bill Frist , limiting jury awards to $500,000 . But even that did n't shake Norwood until last week , when he determined he 'd been played for a chump and introduced his bill . The White House complains that Norwood was inflexible . This week the Democratic-controlled Senate will take up Edwards ' bill . Republicans will try to pick it apart , but they know it 's an uphill fight . " You can never win an argument that people ca n't sue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ un-American . " <P>  --  Reported by John F. Dickerson and Douglas Waller
