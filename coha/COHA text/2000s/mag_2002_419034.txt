Section : WHO 'S NEXT One year , two sequals  --  and a revolution in moviemaking . An exclusive look behind the scenes of 2003 's hottest flicks <p> The Warner Brothers studio lot in Burbank , Calif. , is frenetic on most days , but on a Thursday in early November it was really humming . The company 's box-office Bigfoot for 2002 , " Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets , " was set to open in eight days , and nearly every division of the studio was working furiously to get it ready . Until 2:30 p.m . That 's when everything stopped . For the next half hour , the boy wizard had to make way for " The Matrix . " All morning , buzz had rippled through the lot that producer Joel Silver would be screening , for the first time , 20 minutes from the sci-fi smash hit 's two feverishly anticipated sequels , " The Matrix Reloaded " and " The Matrix Revolutions , " both of which will hit theaters in 2003 . In Hollywood , showing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his grand unveiling was juiced with 35 Warners executives  --  and one NEWSWEEK journalist  --  by 2:25 . By 2:50 , people were peeling their jaws off the floor . <p> The climax of " Reloaded " is a lengthy freeway chase that , like the original " Matrix " in 1999 , will redefine action filmmaking and visual effects for years . Two familiar heroes , Trinity ( Carrie-Anne Moss ) and Morpheus ( Laurence Fishburne ) , have captured a critical pawn in mankind 's struggle against the Machines : the Keymaker , a tiny Asian man who has access to all the doors into the Machine world . Now they must safely get the Keymaker out of the Matrix and back into the real world , and the only way to do that is through a hard telephone line . The closest one is a few miles down a nearby freeway . The trouble is , in the Matrix , a freeway is the last place you want to be . There are people everywhere , meaning the bad-guy Agents have an unlimited supply of bodies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missile . " You always said never get on the freeway , " Trinity reminds Morpheus as they race up the entrance ramp . " You said it was suicide . " Morpheus grins . " Let us hope , " the rebellion 's Zen-calm leader says , " that I was wrong . " <p> The ensuing sequence may be the most audaciously conceived , thrillingly executed car chase ever filmed . Sounds like hype , yeah . But you 've got ta see this thing . The scene features two kung fu battles in speeding vehicles  --  one in the back seat of a Cadillac , the other on the roof of an 18-wheeler truck . There 's also a heart-stopping motorcycle chase through oncoming traffic and enough wrecked cars to keep a junkyard in business for years . Fans will go particularly bonkers over one shot of an agent leaping from atop a moving car onto the hood of another and , with his feet , crushing the entire thing into a pretzel . Says cinematographer Bill Pope : " It 's going to make ' The Fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dimwitted ' . " <p> Four years ago " The Matrix " arrived out of nowhere and grossed $171 million in the United States alone  --  terrific for an R-rated film . But it accelerated into a phenomenon thanks to DVD , becoming the format 's first title to sell a million copies . Fans watch it again and again , each time discovering cool new bits , like how the phone conversation that opens the film foreshadows a key betrayal and how scenes inside the Matrix have a green tinge while scenes in the " real world " are blue . ( Sorry , geeked out there for a second ... ) Critics , meanwhile , lauded writer-directors Larry and Andy Wachowski for bringing an elegance and choreography to American action films that had been missing since the days of Sam Peckinpah . On a basic level , though , " The Matrix " was simply good storytelling . " I 've heard the ' Star Wars ' people boast about shooting frames that are 97 percent digital , and lo and behold , the movies are soulless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Matrix " movies . " They traded the whole idea of depth in filmmaking for this supertechnological hype . It helped us focus our own philosophy : the story drives everything . " <p> The sequels appear to have only one serious drawback : you ca n't see the first one for five months . " Reloaded , " which features every actor whose character survived the original , including Keanu Reeves as Neo and Hugo Weaving as the relentless Agent Smith , arrives in theaters on May 15 . Then , in a potentially risky strategy , Warner Bros. will release " Revolutions " just six months later , in early November . " Our fans would be angry at us if we made them wait any longer , " producer Silver explains . " ' Reloaded ' ends , I promise you , at a moment of true filmus interruptus . " <p> The sequels were shot simultaneously in Australia over a 270-day stretch from 2001 to 2002 . Combined , they cost more than $300 million  --  probably far more , but no one 's talking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will hit stores the same day that " Reloaded " opens in theaters ( sidebar ) . The Wachowskis are also spearheading a DVD project , due in June , called " The Animatrix , " a collection of nine animated short films with stories that fit like puzzle pieces into the movies ' mythology . Make a mental note : 2003 is going to be the year of " The Matrix . " <p> To date , the Wachowskis have worked meticulously to keep " Reloaded " and " Revolutions " shrouded in secrecy . Even its stars say they 've seen just a few scraps of film . So how about we spill a few beans ? The first " Matrix " told the story of a hacker named Neo , who learns that his reality is simply a computer simulation created by machines to enslave the human race . Once jolted from his lifelong slumber , Neo discovers that he 's a messianic figure known as the One , and that it 's his destiny to save the world . " Reloaded " begins right where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sequels blissfully uninformed , better skip the rest of this paragraph . ) The machines have made a terrifying breakthrough : they 've learned the location of Zion , the last human city , hidden near the Earth 's core . Their plan is to tunnel down to the city and use thousands of sentinels  --  the squidlike kamikazes from part one  --  to obliterate it . Tracking down the Keymaker is the humans ' only hope . But he 's being guarded by a pair of new villains known as the Twins , a dreadlocked duo who wield switchblades and can vanish and reappear like ghosts . Along the way , we 'll meet Niobe ( Jada Pinkett Smith ) , a former lover of Morpheus ' , and Persephone ( Monica Bellucci ) , a shady temptress who tries to seduce Neo . We 'll see that the Matrix is actually a megacity , more than 10 times the size of New York . We 'll discover that the machine world is n't entirely evil , that there are powerful machines that have been surpassed by newer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And , of course , we 'll catch up with our favorite machine , Agent Smith , who 's learned to replicate himself like a virus . In one bravura kung fu sequence , shown to NEWSWEEK in rough form , Neo faces off against one hundred Agent Smiths . <p> And that 's just the first sequel . ( Come to think of it , better skip this paragraph , too . ) The plot of " Revolutions " depends heavily on the outcome of " Reloaded , " so we ca n't reveal much just yet . Suffice it to say that " Revolutions " is essentially , from start to finish , one all-out war between the humans and the machines . Unlike " Reloaded , " most of which is set inside the Matrix , " Revolutions " unfolds largely in the smoking ruins of the futuristic real world . Silver is promising a climactic battle like we 've never seen before : a 17-minute sequence that alone cost about two thirds of the budget of the first " Matrix . " ( That film , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> Maybe four or five other directors on the planet could persuade a studio to give them that kind of money  --  and they 've all made far more movies than the Wachowskis . Outside of the " Matrix " trilogy , Larry , 37 , and Andy , 35 , have made just one other film : the clever , 1996 lesbian noir " Bound , " which they did simply to prove to Warner Bros. that they were fit to direct " The Matrix . " The brothers always had sequels in mind  --  " The Matrix " was conceived as a trilogy  --  but they still played hardball about coming back . Warner Brothers agreed to an unusual clause in their contract excusing them from doing any publicity whatsoever , including this story . Silver insists it 's because the brothers want the movies to speak for them . Perhaps . But the Wachowskis clearly get a kick out of cultivating a **26;1015;TOOLONG persona . Their bio on the " Matrix " Web site reveals only that the two " have been working together for 30 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " <p> Silver has been deputized to speak for the brothers , and he 's a good choice . The producer , the Hollywood titan behind the " Lethal Weapon " series , is a world-champion talker , teased by his employees for his verbal uneconomy . He answered one NEWSWEEK question with a 1,840-word reply . ( The question was , " Can you give me an example ? " Never ask Joel Silver this . ) But even he has trouble articulating how Larry and Andy , whom he calls " the boys , " are different . The cast and crew all insist that the brothers are not a two-headed monster . When pressed to elaborate , however , they all pause for a while and end up noting how eerie it is that the siblings never seem to disagree . Both men consume books like air , but Larry , it 's said , prefers philosophy while Andy reads science fiction . Larry likes wine ; Andy likes beer . Andy is the more accommodating of the two ; " Larry , " says Pope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If there 's one lingering criticism of the Wachowskis ' work , it 's that " The Matrix " is n't nearly as original as it seems  --  that it 's really just a pastiche of more obscure texts . This is both true and a load of hooey . Yes , " The Matrix " borrowed heavily from several sources , mostly comic books , Japanese anime and Asian kung fu movies ( graphic ) . " But I think people misunderstand art when they say things like that , " says Pope . " Once you filter an influence through yourself , it 's not the same thing anymore  --  if you really filter it . There 's a film vocabulary out there , and it 's for everybody to use . " <p> Now , of course , " The Matrix " is the source material that everyone else is ripping off . Ad agencies know that even a whiff of the film  --  the music , the camerawork , the sunglasses  --  can still , four years later , sell anything from cars to sneakers . Costume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion designer , during which the reporter asked the designer what his influences were for the season . " He said , ' The Matrix , ' and I just screamed , " Barrett recalls proudly . " Usually film follows fashion , not the other way around . " Nothing from the movie has been swiped as often as " bullet time , " the dazzling FX trick in which the camera appears to whiz 360 degrees around a central image . It was jammed into " Charlie 's Angels " and parodied in " Shrek " and " Scary Movie . " If you watched the Super Bowl last year , you saw a crude version of it on Fox , which used the technology ( cleverly , for a change ) to show big plays from numerous angles . At first , Silver says , the Wachowskis were tickled by the copycatting , but soon they began noticing fight scenes  --  like the one in " Charlie 's Angels "  --  that were shot exactly like theirs . " So they decided to create images that no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only two ways to do that : time and money . " <p> The freeway chase was the first sequence the Wachowskis tackled for the sequels , and they spent months searching for the perfect location . The brothers wanted their free-way to have a sense of doom about it ; not surprisingly , most urban planners try to avoid that . So the search came up empty . The brothers ' solution was a tad uncon-ventional : they dumped the idea of shoot-ing on an existing freeway and built their own . In February 2001 , they hired a construction crew to erect a two-mile loop  --  complete with exit signs , dividers , an on ramp and an overpass  --  on an old U.S. naval base in Alameda , Calif . When they first heard the idea , the construction guys nearly keeled over . " They actually said to us , ' We 're not doing this ' , " recalls executive producer Grant Hill . " They could n't believe it was for a movie . They said , ' Do you realize how much this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile . " We just looked at each other and said , ' OK , we can do that ' . " <p> After a seven-week shoot on the freeway , filming shifted to Sydney for the 270-day marathon  --  and , almost immediately , everything went to hell . On Aug. 25 , 2001 , 22-year-old pop star Aaliyah , who had been cast in a supporting role , was killed in a plane crash . ( She was replaced by " Ali " costar Nona Gaye , Marvin Gaye 's daughter . ) Then , a month later , 64-year-old Gloria Foster , who played the Oracle in the original film and had shot her scenes in " Reloaded , " died of diabetes . " Our oldest and our youngest , " says Fishburne . " We lost our youth and our wisdom . " Foster was particularly beloved by the cast and crew . A revered stage actress , she had finally earned a dose of recognition thanks to " The Matrix . " " If she was British , she would 've been a Dame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , was September 11 . Did anyone wonder if the movies were jinxed ? " It was definitely something you thought about , " Keanu Reeves admits . The actor had heartbreak of his own : while he was in Australia , his sister suffered a relapse of leukemia and endured lengthy treatment . Asked about her , Reeves , sipping a Jack-and-coke at a Manhattan hotel bar , glances away and goes silent for several seconds . Then he looks back and smiles . The clear implication : " next question . " " Making this movie , " says Silver , " was like the Crusades . " <p> It 's far from over . Between now and next November , Gaeta 's visual-effects company , Esc ( as in the " escape " button on a keyboard ) , and six other FX houses will have to deliver more than 2,500 separate shots , many of which will have taken nearly three years to complete . ( By comparison , the first " Matrix " had 412 FX shots . ) The price tag : a whopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Esc on the base in Alameda . Gaeta 's previous company , Manix , won a visual-effects Oscar for the first " Matrix "  --  an upset victory over George Lucas 's " The Phantom Menace . " But Manix was far too small to handle what the Wachowskis wanted for the sequels . " Reloaded " and " Revolutions " required technology that , at the time , had n't been invented yet . <p> Gaeta 's office at Esc is on the balcony of a monstrous , 250,000-square-foot hangar , located directly above the pyrotechnics department . The base itself was decommissioned in the late 1980s by the Bush administration , and these days , Gaeta is its commander in chief . A naval officer would probably take one look at him and order a court-martial : he wears tinted rectangular glasses and dresses like a rave DJ , and he loves racing across the base in his Lexus two-seater at speeds close to 100mph . The effects whiz is especially giddy today , because he finally gets to tell an outsider about " virtual cinematography , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make bullet time look like finger painting . Welcoming his guest inside , he begins by apologizing for any ruckus that might occur downstairs . " We 're blowing up sentinels today , " he says . Twenty minutes later , a distant voice cries out , " Fire in the hole ! " Gaeta pauses for a few seconds . Silence . So he resumes talking . The next instant , a deafening blast sends him ( and his interviewer ) ducking for cover . A tinkling sound showers the outer wall of his office . " Did you hear that ? " he asks , delighted . " I think that was debris ! " Gaeta laughs . " Welcome to the war zone . " <p> Virtual cinematography wipes out the line in the sand between what is real and what looks like the work of a computer . " Anyone who watches movies or TV or just lives their life is the ultimate expert in realism , " Gaeta says . " You know when things are fake . You can just sense it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reloaded " between Neo and the 100 Agent Smiths ? Obviously , only one of those Agent Smiths is the real actor , Hugo Weaving  --  but you wo n't be able to tell which one . The other 99 , all digital creations , are three-dimensional , photo-realistic copies . They 're not just close approximations . They 're perfect . Their hair ripples , their faces contort , their bodies twist and fight . Now , if Gaeta and his team can create virtual humans , then they can create virtual anything : rooms , vehicles , you name it . And they have . And you 'll never know . <p> The refreshing thing about virtual cinematography is that it starts out with the genuine article . " We try to base everything on real actors and real objects , " says Gaeta . " It 's a very strong philosophical view that Larry and Andy and all of us share . " Here 's a gross oversimplification of how it works . Using five high-resolution digital cameras strong enough to pick up details like pores and follicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This process is called universal capture , or u-cap . The team then feeds the information from all five cameras into a computer , and a complex algorithm calculates the actor 's appearance from every single angle the cameras missed . " Once we have the master performance captured , " Gaeta explains , " we can actually use it to create an event , like a martial-arts fight . But it could be anything . " Like , for example , a scene in which Neo flies at 2,000mph through a metropolis  --  which is what you 're looking at on the cover of this magazine . <p> So the creators of " The Matrix "  --  a movie about a phony world in which it 's impossible to tell real from fake  --  can now create cinema in which it 's impossible to tell real from fake . Eerie , huh ? Reeves smiles when asked if the topic ever came up during filming . " Yes , " he says emphatically . " What 's cool about Gaeta , from an actor 's standpoint , is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's being represented . On the other hand , once they have the source material , you , the actor , are no longer involved . And that gives the directors a certain amount of control . " And how did you feel about that ? Reeves smiles again . " Well , there is a degree of ambivalence . " <p> If he had to be digitally manipulated by anyone , though , Reeves would pick the Wachowskis , whose good-natured perfectionism motivated him like no one else has . " Larry and Andrew were always asking more of us . In the kung fu scenes , " he says , chuckling , " they would ask me , ' Can you duck a little bit later ? ' But I loved it . I loved that we were working on a project that was really reaching . " He stops , then pays his bosses the ultimate compliment . " I really miss Neo .
