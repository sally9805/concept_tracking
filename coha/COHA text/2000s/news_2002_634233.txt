<p> Such a robust attack on my great-grandfather deserves a defense " Governors in the grip of scandal , " Steve Neal column , April 8 . <p> Every generation or so , the charge that Gov . Len Small " looted " the state comes around , like an old counterfeit bill that lingers in circulation . <p> The civil case against him was finally decided in the Illinois Supreme Court ( 319 Ill. 437 ) in a split decision . It involved deposits made by him as state treasurer in a private bank in Grant Park . At the heart of the case were complex accounting issues . The majority decision runs 45 pages ; two justices found for the governor , and their dissent runs 112 pages . <p> As a co-defendant , he was jointly liable for restitution along with the bank operators . However , the final settlement of the case contained : " ... a finding and agreement by the parties that the defendant , Len Small , under the evidence does not appear to have received any sums of money whatsoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasury . " <p> It 's well-known that politics in those days was personal and vicious . It 's less well-known that journalism was personal , vicious and slanted . Even the great Joseph Pulitzer made stuff up , according to his new biography . <p> I suspect that it works like this : Much history comes from the files of the Chicago Tribune , whose publisher , Col. Robert McCormick , had a deep enmity for the governor , which affected reporting in a way that is unimaginable today . The files of the Chicago American , which had another take on these issues , are harder to access , to put it mildly . As books are written , these tainted sources morph into " facts " which are quoted casually without attribution . <p> If it 's old and published , it must be true , goes the thinking . <p> Current examples of this kind of flawed research are the plagiarism controversies tainting historians Doris Kearns Goodwin and Stephen Ambrose . <p> How bad was it in the 1920s ? Here are some nuggets from our family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never share the same dais with Gov . Small . When that happened , the photo was altered to remove the governor . When he left office , his successor charged he absconded with the silverware ; his daughter , who had been the official hostess , had to show them where it was stored in the safe . My grandmother told me he had discovered a woman planted in his hotel room closet , ready to spring out for a photo-op ( in Chicago , of course ) . <p> The Republican Party mirrored today 's Democrats . Small ran as a populist running against the " trusts , " and enlisting the Chicago Machine , with all its baggage , to help win the state . <p> In office , his programs included a huge road-building program , the founding of the State Police , and the foundations of a statewide mental health system . <p> When charges are made , it 's very hard to prove a negative , especially after many years . As his namesake , I can tell you that during my 59 years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of context , volunteer that he was a fine and honorable man . <p> Len R. Small , Kankakee <p> Thank you for publishing the excellent series on , " Crime , Inc. , Following the Money : Gangs " April 7 and 8 . Since we published our 1995 report , " Gangs : Public Enemy Number One , " the gang drug cartels are continuing to flourish , and we are paying the price in crime and violence . <p> For the first quarter of 2002 , murder is down in New York by nearly 40 percent over the same period last year , and murder in Manhattan is down so far that it is now the lowest since before World War I. Yet in Chicago , despite endless promises to " do whatever it takes , " murder rates are up once again , and we are still solving only 50 percent or fewer of the killings . Hundreds of these murders are gang-related and can be drastically reduced . Otherwise , we will soon have a murder rate of five times that of New York . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , Chicago has had three times the per capita rate of police officers killed in the line of duty , and twice the rate of Los Angeles  --  almost exactly mirroring our murder rate . <p> Until the political leadership , the police brass , the rank-and-file officers and community residents are all in agreement with a co-ordinated strategy to attack violent crime  --  and are willing to accept and share responsibility  --  no significant improvement will be possible . Given the acrimonious history of relationships between these groups , it will require a lot of hard work to produce any results . But how long can we afford to wait ? <p> Thomas B. Kirkpatrick , president , <p> Chicago Crime Commission <p> After reading your articles about gangs and drugs , my only reaction is disgust at how wrong-headed the government response to drugs is . Why in the world are we propping up this black market system , allowing street gangs to accrue enormous profits while they visit endless violence on our neighborhoods ? At the same time , the government is burning up precious monetary resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be better used solving and preventing real crimes like murder , theft and rape . Crimes where one person hurts another . <p> Yes , drugs are dangerous . But not nearly as dangerous as prohibition . People will die from using them , but not nearly as many as will die from the war on drugs . Why does our government think it knows what is best for all ? The fact of the matter is the vast majority of people can do drugs and set them aside whenever they want to , just like most most people do with alcohol . <p> Critics of drug legalization argue that drugs support terrorists . But they never speak the simple truth : Buying drugs can help terrorists only if the drugs are illegal . Terrorists did n't make the drugs illegal , our government did . I wish our elected leaders would have the courage to legalize drugs . <p> Matthew Parker , Lincoln Park <p> Another primary election has passed with the same administrative position on the ballot . It 's about time the secretary of state position be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for licensing and the elimination of this position . <p> Springfield lawmakers have earned this voter 's pink slip for allowing licensing for sale , shoeboxes of cash , illegal war chests of cash , questionable rental contracts , and so on . <p> This pink slip for eliminating this administrative position needs to be reviewed by the voters in November by referendum . <p> Rich Juds , Orland Park <p> In the April 6 news story about our legislators in Springfield " Dems act to restore Ryan cuts " , a debate was reported concerning the Democrats ' determination to restore the budget cuts that Republicans are proposing to solve the Illinois budget crisis . No plans on how to raise the money for these " restorations " was included , but there was a revealing quote by Democrat Rep. Garry Hannig of Litchfield : " These are important priorities that we have in the House , and we need to have them addressed . In the process , as it unwinds , we can make additional cuts somewhere else , we can do revenue . " <p> Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " means higher taxes and more of them . Democrats in Illinois need to complain about Hannig and his cohorts , and Republicans should continue to demand a budget that fits current revenue  --  or , better yet , a " wartime budget " that further tightens our belts for our country 's sake . No new taxes ! No higher taxes ( or fees ) ! <p> Joanne Butz , Lake View <p> I read where Massachusetts is giving millions to candidates who keep within a certain budget . This would require candidates to budget and think through their campaigns  --  skills needed to run the office as well as run for the office . <p> Perhaps Illinois lawmakers could work on this ? <p> Susan Lenz , Near North Side <p> Regarding Colin Powell 's trip to the Middle East : To even begin to reduce the Israeli-Palestinian slaughter , Powell 's mission must be to express himself most strongly on the subject of all violence as the wrong solution to grievances . The bloody military game of tit-for-tat is schoolyard logic extended to geopolitics . But killings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them are always made anew . But there are root causes to this conflict . <p> A United Nations map of the Israeli settlements that have been established in Palestinian Territory ( West Bank and Gaza ) since June 1967 clearly shows a major cause of the war in the Middle East . As of Dec. 9 , 2001 , there were some 213 Israeli settlements scattered throughout the West Bank and Gaza . <p> All of these settlements are connected by roads that are controlled and patrolled by the Israeli military . This has the effect of reducing the Palestinian Authority to near-impotence and makes impossible the establishment of an independent Palestinian state . <p> These Israeli settlements on Palestinian land have long been part of the plan of Ariel Sharon to expel Palestinians from Eretz Yisrael , the messianic dream of an Israel that should occupy and rule in all of Palestine in fulfillment of biblical prophecy . <p> It seems irrational to believe that peace in the Middle East can be established if Palestinians are not allowed to control their own territory . <p> Sydney G. Bild , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It 's not too late : Renounce terrorism ! You do n't have to stop planning and supporting terrorism , just renounce it . And look serious . <p> I promise you : You will travel to Europe and meet dignitaries . They will love you . You will be asked to speak at the UN , and get weapons sent to you by the " boatload . " You may even win a Nobel Peace Prize . <p> Renounce terror . It 'll just take 5 seconds , and boy , is it worth it . <p> Your friend , Yasser <p> Jonathan Neuman , Skokie <p> I had been an avid supporter of the State of Israel for many years , cheering their military victories in the wars with their bellicose , hostile Arab neighbors . <p> But lately my perceptions are changing . <p> I see now an Israel which , in its dealings with the Palestinians , both Christian and Muslim , is so wantonly squandering the precious currency of Holocaust sympathy and compassion that moral bankruptcy looms . <p> And I am deeply , deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
