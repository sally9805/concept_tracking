<p> At this time last year , the historic Cumbres &; Toltec Scenic Railroad was dying . <p> In January 2003 , the tourist line had neither an operator nor a working coal-fired steam locomotive , and it was n't accepting any reservations . Railroad officials managed to carry riders last year , but just barely . <p> This year , in contrast , officials hope to double ridership and plan to have three vintage steam locomotives on line when the season opens May 29 . <p> What changed ? A new management team has come on board with plans to make long-neglected maintenance a priority . And despite continued uncertainty over its ownership and future funding , an infusion of cash last year has bought the C &TS; some time . <p> The 64-mile narrow-gauge line , built in the 1880s , crosses the remote , mountainous New Mexico- <p> Colorado border 11 times on each trip between Antonito and Chama , N.M. , chugging over 10,015-foot Cumbres Pass . <p> The only state-owned passenger train in Colorado , the C &TS; is arguably the most scenic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that served the rich silver-mining district of the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado . <p> Problems arose early in its history as a tourist rail . In 1970 , Colorado and New Mexico jointly purchased the track , related railroad structures , nine vintage steam locomotives , more than 130 freight and work cars , and the Chama yard and maintenance facility for $ 547,000 . The purchase , officials said , was part of an effort to save the fragile economies of the remote towns at either end of the line . <p> The C &TS; began hauling passengers the following year . <p> But current managers say the track and equipment maintenance was ignored for about 30 years , creating last year 's near-meltdown . Mother Nature also played havoc with the line : Extreme forest-fire danger and some washed-out track following heavy rains also frequently shut it down . <p> Last winter , determined shop crews managed to refurbish one engine to keep the line alive . It became a latter-day ' Little Engine That Could , ' laboring alone through the Memorial Day weekend to mid-October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated matters . Traditionally , the state legislatures in Colorado and New Mexico made annual contributions , which varied enormously each year , to keep the C &TS; running . <p> In 2003 , the Colorado legislature , trying to close a budget hole , provided only a token $ 10,000 . In response , New Mexico provided a record infusion of $ 1.3 million in 2003 to keep the tourist railroad alive . <p> In the end , Colorado agencies managed to give the line $ 330,000 from various sources , including $ 180,000 from the Colorado Historical Society . <p> That was the beginning of hope for the railroad . <p> ' Since I got on board , we 've received about $ 4.7 million ; we have never been in a better financial position , ' said Richard Gomez , who in May became executive director of the bi-state Cumbres &; Toltec Scenic Railroad Commission , which oversees the railroad . <p> Much of that cash , including a three-year $ 3 million-plus grant from the federal government , was requested long before his arrival . <p> Gomez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repairs . His wish list for 2004 totals another $ 4.6 million for track upgrades , locomotive repairs , rehabilitation of passenger cars , repairs to the Chama Depot , a water tank , dining facilities and operations . <p> Maintenance was virtually ignored for so long because the commission permitted three different operators - each of whom leased the railroad - to ' pocket all the revenue , make all the decisions and operate as he sees fit while waiting for the ' obscene profits ' to roll in , ' explained Brian Shoup , president and chief executive of the nonprofit Friends of the Cumbres &; Toltec since February . <p> Today , the commission contracts with the Rio Grande Railway Preservation Corp. , created by the Friends group four years ago to run the railroad , and pays its costs plus a 5 percent management fee , down from last year 's 9 percent . <p> The rest of the revenue is plowed back into the railroad itself , Shoup said . <p> There are still uncertainties for the railroad . The most important question is whether joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues arose , Gov . Bill Richardson of New Mexico offered to buy out Colorado 's share in the railroad to provide financial stability and bonding authority . <p> Any change in the train 's ownership is n't likely to happen soon . A buyout would literally take an act of Congress , according to Paul Shipley , a spokesman for the governor of New Mexico , because the bi-state commission that runs the railroad was itself created by an act of Congress . <p> Shipley said acquisition talks are ' very , very , very preliminary ' but are now taking place among Congressional delegations . <p> Colorado officials say they want to hang on to their share of the line . <p> ' New Mexico did offer to purchase the train , ' but Colorado Gov . Bill Owens has no interest in selling , said his spokesman , Dan Hopkins . <p> Still , at least one resident of Antonito , a former mayor , is worried by the idea of losing ownership . <p> ' That really hurts , ' said town trustee and former mayor Harold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counting dogs and cats ' relies on the economic support of tens of thousands of rail passengers . Many Colorado lawmakers think Antonito is in New Mexico , Abeyta added . <p> And it does n't look like the Colorado legislature will provide any money this calendar year . <p> ' There is nothing in the governor 's budget for this year , ' said Mike Beasley , executive director of the Colorado Department of Local Affairs . ' We are not going to match New Mexico . There is nothing that requires us to match . ' <p> Asked about the tradition of matching grants for the C &TS,; Beasley said , ' That has n't been the case for seven or eight years . There were many years when New Mexico was n't able to do anything . ' <p> ' We will go down to the railroad and see what the needs are and work with them on a grant basis , ' he added . <p> New Mexico 's Richardson is asking for $ 700,000 for the railroad this year , Shipley said . <p> Meanwhile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rebuilding locomotives and refurbishing passenger cars . <p> Once the nearly century-old locomotives are brought up to stringent new federal standards , and once rolling stock , track and rail facilities are updated , the C &TS; should attract 50,000 to 60,000 riders a season , a number that Shoup said would be enough to let it become financially self-sufficient . <p> " We are significantly more hopeful with continued public support , " he said . " We have nowhere to go but up .
