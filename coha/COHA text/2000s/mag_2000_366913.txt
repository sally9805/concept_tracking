If the idea of a long novel about horses and horse racing has all the appeal of an afternoon at a seedy OTB outpost , read on . For Jane Smiley 's Horse Heaven ( Knopf ; 561 pages ; $26 ) turns out to go down quite easily  --  more like a pitcher of mint juleps at the Kentucky Derby . Smiley , who has already given us an epic about Greenland , an academic comedy set in the Midwest and historical fiction about abolition , has as great a range and as much intellectual curiosity as any novelist writing today . In her latest book , she takes on a fresh topic and once again winds up in the winner 's circle . <P> Horse Heaven is basically a book of vignettes that only occasionally interlock , and the real challenge for the reader is keeping all those characters , human and equine , straight . There is Justa Bob , a good-natured gelding who knows how to race , and Epic Steam , a stallion badly in need of a gelding . There is Buddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than about the horses ( even after he finds Jesus ) , and Farley Jones , who adheres to The Tibetan Book of Thoroughbred Training ( " Do not see any fault anywhere ... Do not hanker after signs of progress " ) . There are the rich owners , desperate to get their playthings to the Breeders ' Cup , and the struggling breeders , the jockeys and the horse masseurs . And above all , there are the races , riveting set pieces that Smiley creates with a passion that can not help being infectious . <P> Somehow this plotless work becomes suspenseful . The promising Thoroughbred goes lame ; the unassuming little chestnut wins a race . " A football game is one story , one day a week . That 's boring , " a track addict explains to his son . " A day at the races is thousands of stories , with grass around , trees around , a breeze , some mountains in the background . " Smiley tells just a few of those stories , but it makes for a fine day out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
