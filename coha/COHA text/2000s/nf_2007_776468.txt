Essential Gear // It is n't that easy these days to get hold of an old tobacco tin  --  but they are just the right size for this sort of collection . One of the authors once took a white mouse into school , though considering what happened when he sat on it , that is not to be recommended . We think pockets are for cramming full of useful things . // 1 . Swiss Army Knife . // Still the best small penknife . It can be carried in luggage on planes , though not in hand luggage . It is worth saving up for a high-end model , with as many blades and attachments as you can get . That said , there are good ones to be had for about $30 . They are useful for jobs requiring a screwdriver , removing splinters and opening bottles of beer and wine , though this may not be a prime consideration at this time . // Leather holders can also be purchased and the best ones come with a few extras , like a compass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . Compass . // These are satisfying to own . Small ones can be bought from any camping or outdoor store and they last forever . You really should know where north is , wherever you are . // 3 . Handkerchief . // There are many uses for a piece of cloth , from preventing smoke inhalation or helping with a nosebleed to offering one to a girl when she cries . Big ones can even be made into slings . They 're worth having . // 4 . Box of Matches . // It goes without saying that you must be responsible . Matches kept in a dry tin or inside a plastic bag can be very useful on a cold night when you are forced to sleep in a field . Dipping the tips in wax makes them waterproof . Scrape the wax off with a fingernail when you want to light them . // 5 . A Shooter. // Your favorite big marble . // 6 . Needle and Thread . // Again , there are a number of useful things you can do with these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repairing a torn shirt . Make sure the thread is strong and then it can be used for fishing . // 7 . Pencil and Paper . // If you see a crime and want to write down a license plate number or a description , you are going to need one . Alternatively , it works for shopping lists or practically anything . // 8 . Small Flashlight // There are ones available for key rings that are small and light . If you are ever in darkness and trying to read a map , a flashlight of any kind will be useful . // 9 . Magnifying Glass . // For general interest . Can also be used to start a fire . // 10 . Band-Aids. // Just one or two , or better still , a piece from a cloth bandage roll that can be cut with penknife scissors . They probably wo n't be used , but you never know . // 11 . Fishhooks. // If you have strong thread and a tiny hook , you only need a stick and a worm to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip into a piece of cork , or you 'll snag yourself on it . // The Greatest Paper Airplane in the World // In the 1950s , an elementary school principal found a boy throwing paper airplanes from a high window . The head was considering punishments when he noticed the plane was still in the air , flying across the playground below . The boy escaped a detention , but he did have to pass on the design to the principal  --  who passed it on to his own children . You will find more complicated designs . You may be sold the idea that the best planes require scissors and lessons in origami . This is nonsense . // The plane on the right  --  the Harrier  --  is simple , fast and can be made from a letter-size sheet of paper . It is the best long-distance glider you 'll ever see  --  and with a tweak or two , the best stunt plane . It has even won competitions . One was to clear the entire road from a hotel balcony next to Windsor Castle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the tarmac  --  this one sailed clear across . The one on the left  --  the Bulldog Dart  --  is a simple dart , a warm-up plane , if you like . It 's a competent glider . // The Bulldog Dart // 1 . Fold a letter-size sheet of paper lengthways to get a center line . // 2 . Fold two corners into the center line , as in the picture . // 3 . Turn the paper over and fold those corners in half , as shown . // 4 . Fold the pointy nose back on itself to form the snub nose . You might try folding the nose underneath , but both ways work well . // 5 . Fold the whole plane lengthways , as shown . // 6 . Finally , fold the wings in half to complete the Bulldog Dart . // Good  --  now you know a design that really works . You may have noticed the insectlike plane in the middle of the first picture . It does have complicated " floats " and inverse folds . However , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the overcomplicated designs . We think that matters . Yes , it looks like a locust , but if it nose-dives , what exactly is the point ? // Here , then , is the gold standard . It flies . // The Harrier // 1 . Begin in the same way as the Bulldog Dart . Fold in half lengthways to find your center line and then fold two corners into that line , as shown . // 2 . Fold that top triangle down , as you see in the picture . It should look like an envelope . // 3 . Fold in the second set of corners . You should be able to leave a triangular point sticking out . // 4 . Fold the triangle over the corners to hold them down . // 5 . Fold in half along the spine , leaving the triangle on the outside , as shown . // 6 . Finally , fold the wings back on themselves , finding your halfway line carefully . The more care you take to be accurate with these folds , the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at slower launch speeds . It can stall at high speed , but if you lift one of the flaps slightly at the back , it will swoop and return to your hand or fly in a great spiral . Fiddle with your plane until you are happy with it . Each one will be slightly different and have a character of its own . //
