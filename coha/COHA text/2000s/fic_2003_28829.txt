Nawat stood against the wall , relaxed and alert . Before him two men-at-arms were preparing to shoot . Dove stood behind one archer with a handful of arrows , while the duchess held arrows for the second archer . Aly 's mind told her that the duchess would hardly consent to murder just as the first man shot . The second man shot immediately after him . Then both set fresh arrows to the string and shot steadily , arrow after arrow , one at a time , until they had exhausted all the extras held by the duchess and her stepdaughter . Nawat caught them all with grace and ease , snatching the arrows from the air as if he had all day to do so . When the archers finished , he gathered the heap of arrows at his feet and carried them back to their owners . He 's so fast , Aly thought in awe . I could n't do it , and I 'm no slouch ! She sighed , wishing Da were here to see it . He 'd taught her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more hazardous . The game was not done . The men-at-arms repeated the experiment with javelins , then hunting and combat spears . Nawat caught them all , moving so fast Aly could n't follow his hands . She cheered him and the men-at-arms on . When the bell rang to remind the household it was nearly time for supper , he looked up at the applauding Aly and waved . This is my favorite game , he called to her . Do you want to play ? I would n't dare ! she cried , laughing , before she retreated into the room . She 'd seen men catch knives before . She had seen the finest archers in the Queen 's Riders draw an outline in arrows of someone positioned against a wooden fence or wall , just to show they could do it . She had never seenanything like this . Sarai and Dove ran in . Sarai smiled at Aly . You should have seen your face ! Did you know he could do that ? she asked as she collapsed on her bed . Dove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing , she said , coiling her bowstring . You know , maybe this horrible old place is n't so bad , Sarai told the ceiling . Not if these wonderful men keep showing up . Aly raised an eyebrow at her . I would n't try kissing him , she warned . It would n't be what you expect . Sarai wrinkled her nose . Aly ! she complained . I found out he eats bugs ! I 'm not kissing a man with bug breath ! Aly blinked . I do n't remember him tasting of bugs when he kissed me , she thought . I 'd better pay more attention next time . Her mind promptly reined her up . This was highly improper . There would be no next time . Her task was looking after the Balitang children , not mooning over someone , particularly not a crow turned man . Even if he could pluck arrows from the air . The next morning Aly , still on a goatherd 's hours , walked out of the keep into the dawn . The sun had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man who straddled a bench there . Aly stopped to watch him carefully glue pieces of feather onto the wooden shaft . Nawat looked up at her with a smile that lit his eyes . You are beautiful in the new light , he told her . If I were the Dawn Crow , I would bring you the sun to hatch as our first nestling . Aly blinked at him . Her heart felt strangely squeezed by some powerful emotion . She bit her lip to distract herself from a feeling that made her horribly unsure . Have you been kissing anybody ? she asked without meaning to , and gasped . She had let words out of her mouth without thinking , which was not like her ! Worse , they were such personal words , ones he might feel meant personal feelings she did not have ! This was the kind of thing that other girls said , those girls who were not bored by all the young men who had courted them . How many handsome fellows had sighed compliments to Aly while , unconcerned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At home she never cared about her suitors enough to worry if they kissed other girls . She scrambled to blot out what she 'd said . Not that it 's any of my business , but you should understand , people have a way of kissing for fun , without it meaning anything serious , and I 'd hate for you to think someone wanted you to mate-feed them just because they 're kissing Stop babbling , her mind ordered . Aly stopped . Nawat 's smile broadened . That disturbing light in his eyes deepened . I have kissed no one but you , Aly , he assured her , serious . Why should I kiss anyone else ? Aly gulped . You can continue this conversation , or you can talk about something less . . . giddy , she told herself . Less frightening . You know I wo n't always be around , she said abruptly . I do n't belong here , really . Then I will go with you , Nawat said . I belong with you . He does n't know what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what that means . She looked at him , arms folded , trying to keep any extra feelings from leaping out . What are you doing ? she asked , to change the subject to anything less dangerous . Then she grimaced . He was fletching arrows , as always . She glanced at his bench , then bent down . He was fletching , but these arrows were heavier , and the feathers he used were not bird feathers , but Stormwing . How did you cut them up ? she wanted to know , genuinely curious . More scraps of cut-up steel feathers lay on the bench . Nawat pointed to a long piece of what looked like black , chipped glass . Shiny volcano rock , he told Aly . Chip the edge until it is sharp . That cuts Stormwing feathers . They come from the heat of the place where Stormwings were born . Aly touched the glassy blade . Obsidian , she said . That 's its name . Yes , Nawat replied . Shiny volcano rock . He set a length of steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in place . Aly did n't see a single cut on his hands , though the feathers were lethally sharp . Wo n't they be too heavy for the glue ? she asked . I shaped the glue . It holds Stormwing feathers , Nawat answered . Stormwings really are born in volcanoes ? Aly inquired , curious . In the beginning time , when they were first dreamed , replied Nawat , setting another piece of steel feather in its slot . Now , if carrying an egg does not kill the mother , they are born from steel eggs . He looked at Aly and sighed , his dark eyes wistful . The eggs are too heavy for a crow to take . You 've already taken enough from Stormwings , Aly told him , pointing to the small pile of glinting feathers beside his bench . You could have been killed . There is a trick to it , he replied , and blew lightly on his fletchings . Holding the arrow shaft before one eye , he squinted down its length . Perfect , he declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of trouble and risk when goose feathers are safer to work with , Aly remarked . What is a Stormwing-fletched arrow for , anyway ? They are mage killers , replied Nawat . No matter if the mage is powerful , if he has great spells to protect him . A Stormwing arrow will cut through illusion and magic . Aly whistled softly , impressed . Take very good care of those , then , she told Nawat . We might find a use for them . I made them for you , Nawat said , giving her that radiant , innocent smile . They are yours , for a day when they will help you . He offered a finished arrow shaft to her . Aly smiled at him despite the goose bumps that rippled along her skin . Keep them until they 're needed , please , she told him . My archery skills are n't very good . You could practice , Nawat pointed out . I 'm a slave , Aly explained . Slaves who are caught with weapons are killed . Then do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not just yet , she replied . I 'll see the summer out first . From the Hardcover edition .
