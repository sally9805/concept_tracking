ONE <br> The thing about lying to your parents is , you have to do it to protect them . It 's for their own good . I mean , take my own parents . If they knew the unvarnished truth about my finances/love life/ plumbing/council tax , they 'd have instant heart attacks and the doctor would say , " Did anyone give them a terrible shock ? " and it would all be my fault . Therefore , they have been in my flat for approximately ten minutes and already I have told them the following lies : <br> 1 . L&amp;N Executive Recruitment will start making profits soon , I 'm sure of it . <br> 2 . Natalie is a fantastic business partner , and it was a really brilliant idea to chuck in my job to become a headhunter with her . <br> 3 . Of course I do n't just exist on pizza , black cherry yogurts , and vodka . <br> 4 . Yes , I did know about interest on parking tickets . <br> 5 . Yes , I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it was great , especially that lady in the bonnet . Yes , Peggotty . That 's who I meant . <br> 6 . I was actually intending to buy a smoke alarm at the weekend , what a coincidence they should mention it . <br> 7 . Yes , it 'll be nice to see all the family again . <br> Seven lies . Not including all the ones about Mum 's outfit . And we have n't even mentioned The Subject . <br> As I come out of my bedroom in a black dress and hastily applied mascara , I see Mum looking at my overdue phone bill on the mantelpiece . <br> " Do n't worry , " I say quickly . " I 'm going to sort that out . " <br> " Only , if you do n't , " says Mum , " they 'll cut off your line , and it 'll take ages for you to get it installed again , and the mobile signal is so patchy here . What if there was an emergency ? What would you do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though this is all totally imminent , as though there 's a woman screaming in labor in the bedroom and floods are rising outside the window and how will we contact the helicopter ? How ? <br> " Er . . . I had n't thought about it . Mum , I 'll pay the bill . Honest . " <br> Mum 's always been a worrier . She gets this tense smile with distant , frightened eyes , and you just know she 's playing out some apocalyptic scenario in her head . She looked like that throughout my last speech day at school ; afterward she confessed she 'd suddenly noticed a chandelier hanging above on a rickety chain and became obsessed by what would happen if it fell down on the girls ' heads and splintered into smithereens ? <br> Now she tugs at her black suit , which has shoulder pads and weird metal buttons and is swamping her . I vaguely remember it from about ten years ago , when she had a phase of going on job interviews and I had to teach her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mouse . She ended up working for a children 's charity , which does n't have a formal dress code , thank goodness . <br> No one in my family looks good in black . Dad 's wearing a suit made out of a dull black fabric which flattens all his features . He 's actually quite handsome , my dad , in a kind of fine-boned , understated way . His hair is brown and wispy , whereas Mum 's is fair and wispy like mine . They both look really great when they 're relaxed and on their own territory-like , say , when we 're all in Cornwall on Dad 's rickety old boat , wearing fleeces and eating pasties . Or when Mum and Dad are playing in their local amateur orchestra , which is where they first met . But today , nobody 's relaxed . <br> " So are you ready ? " Mum glances at my stockinged feet . " Where are your shoes , darling ? " <br> I slump down on the sofa . " Do I have to go ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She was your great-aunt . She was one hundred and five , you know . " <br> Mum has told me my great-aunt was 105 approximately 105 times . I 'm pretty sure it 's because that 's the only fact she knows about her . <br> " So what ? I did n't know her . None of us knew her . This is so stupid . Why are we schlepping to Potters Bar for some crumbly old woman we did n't even ever meet ? " I hunch my shoulders up , feeling more like a sulky three-year-old than a mature twenty-seven-year-old with her own business . <br> " Uncle Bill and the others are going , " says Dad . " And if they can make the effort . . . " <br> " It 's a family occasion ! " puts in Mum brightly . <br> My shoulders hunch even harder . I 'm allergic to family occasions . Sometimes I think we 'd do better as dandelion seeds-no family , no history , just floating off into the world , each on our own piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mum says coaxingly . <br> " It will . " I stare at the carpet . " And everyone will ask me about . . . things . " <br> " No , they wo n't ! " says Mum at once , glancing at Dad for backup . " No one will even mention . . . things . " <br> There 's silence . The Subject is hovering in the air . It 's as though we 're all avoiding looking at it . At last Dad plunges in . <br> " So ! Speaking of . . . things . " He hesitates . " Are you generally . . . OK ? " <br> I can see Mum listening on super-high-alert , even though she 's pretending to be concentrating on combing her hair . <br> " Oh , you know , " I say after a pause . " I 'm fine . I mean , you ca n't expect me just to snap back into- " <br> " No , of course not ! " Dad immediately backs off . Then he tries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good spirits ? " <br> I nod assent . <br> " Good ! " says Mum , looking relieved . " I knew you 'd get over . . . things . " <br> My parents do n't say " Josh " out loud anymore , because of the way I used to dissolve into heaving sobs whenever I heard his name . For a while , Mum referred to him as " He Who Must Not Be Named . " Now he 's just " Things . " <br> " And you have n't . . . been in touch with him ? " Dad is looking anywhere but at me , and Mum appears engrossed in her handbag . <br> That 's another euphemism . What he means is , " Have you sent him any more obsessive texts ? " <br> " No , " I say , flushing . " I have n't , OK ? " <br> It 's so unfair of him to bring that up . In fact , the whole thing was totally blown out of proportion . I only sent Josh a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hardly any . And they were n't obsessive . They were just me being honest and open , which , by the way , you 're supposed to be in a relationship . <br> I mean , you ca n't just switch off your feelings because the other person did , can you ? You ca n't just say , " Oh right ! So your plan is , we never see each other again , never make love again , never talk or communicate in any way . Fab idea , Josh , why did n't I think of that ? " <br> So what happens is , you write your true feelings down in a text simply because you want to share them , and next minute your ex- boyfriend changes his phone number and tells your parents . He 's such a sneak . <br> " Lara , I know you were very hurt , and this has been a painful time for you . " Dad clears his throat . " But it 's been nearly two months now . You 've got to move on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and enjoy yourself . . . " <br> Oh God , I ca n't face another of Dad 's lectures about how plenty of men are going to fall at the feet of a beauty like me . I mean , for a start , there are n't any men in the world , everyone knows that . And a five-foot-three girl with a snubby nose and no suntan is n't exactly a beauty . <br> OK . I know I look all right sometimes . I have a heart-shaped face , wide-set green eyes , and a few freckles over my nose . And to top it off , I have this little bee-stung mouth which no one else in my family has . But take it from me , I 'm no supermodel . <br> " So , is that what you did when you and Mum broke up that time in Polzeath ? Go out and see other people ? " I ca n't help throwing it out , even though this is going over old ground . Dad sighs and exchanges glances with Mum . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she murmurs , rubbing her brow . " We should never have mentioned it- " <br> " ' Because if you 'd done that , " I continue inexorably , " you would never have got back together again , would you ? Dad would never have said that he was the bow to your violin and you would never have got married . " <br> This line about the bow and the violin has made it into family lore . I 've heard the story a zillion times . Dad arrived at Mum 's house , all sweaty because he 'd been riding on his bike , and she 'd been crying but she pretended she had a cold , and they made up their fight and Granny gave them tea and shortbread . ( I do n't know why the shortbread is relevant , but it always gets mentioned . ) <br> " Lara , darling . " Mum sighs . " That was very different ; we 'd been together three years , we were engaged- " <br> " I know ! " I say defensively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , people do sometimes get back together . It does happen . " <br> There 's silence . <br> " Lara , you 've always been a romantic soul- " begins Dad . <br> " I 'm not romantic ! " I exclaim , as though this is a deadly insult . I 'm staring at the carpet , rubbing the pile with my toe , but in my peripheral vision I can see Mum and Dad , each mouthing vigorously at the other to speak next . Mum 's shaking her head and pointing at Dad as though to say , " You go ! " <br> " When you break up with someone , " Dad starts again in an awkward rush , " it 's easy to look backward and think life would be perfect if you got back together . But- " <br> He 's going to tell me how life is an escalator . I have to head him off , quick . <br> " Dad . Listen . Please . " Somehow I muster my calmest tones . " You 've got it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Josh . " I try to sound as if this is a ridiculous idea . " That 's not why I texted him . I just wanted closure . I mean , he broke things off with no warning , no talking , no discussion . I never got any answers . It 's like . . . unfinished business . It 's like reading an Agatha Christie and never knowing whodunnit ! " <br> There . Now they 'll understand . <br> " Well , " says Dad at length , " I can understand your frustrations- " <br> " That 's all I ever wanted , " I say as convincingly as I can . " To understand what Josh was thinking . To talk things over . To communicate like two civilized human beings . " <br> And to get back together with him , my mind adds , like a silent , truthful arrow . Because I know Josh still loves me , even if no one else thinks so . <br> But there 's no point saying that to my parents . They 'd never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept of how amazing Josh and I were as a couple , how we fit together perfectly . They do n't understand how he obviously made a panicked , rushed , boy-type decision , based on some nonexistent reason probably , and how if I could just talk to him , I 'm sure I could straighten everything out and we 'd be together again . <br> Sometimes I feel streets ahead of my parents , just like Einstein must have done when his friends kept saying , " The universe is straight , Albert , take it from us , " and inside he was secretly thinking , " I know it 's curved . I 'll show you one day . " <br> Mum and Dad are surreptitiously mouthing at each other again . I should put them out of their misery . <br> " Anyway , you must n't worry about me , " I say hastily . " Because I have moved on . I mean , OK , maybe I have n't moved on totally , " I amend as I see their dubious expressions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk . I 've realized that it just was n't meant to be . I 've learned a lot about myself , and . . . I 'm in a good place . Really . " <br> My smile is pasted on my face . I feel like I 'm chanting the mantra of some wacky cult . I should be wearing robes and banging a tambourine . <br> Hare hare . . . I 've moved on . . . hare hare . . . I 'm in a good place . . . . <br> Dad and Mum exchange looks . I have no idea whether they believe me , but at least I 've given us all a way out of this sticky conversation . <br> " That 's the spirit ! " Dad says , looking relieved . " Well done , Lara , I knew you 'd get there . And you 've got the business with Natalie to focus on , which is obviously going tremendously well . . . . " <br> My smile becomes even more cultlike . <br> " Absolutely ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going well . . . hare hare . . . it 's not a disaster at all . . . . <br> " I 'm so glad you 've come through this . " Mum comes over and kisses the top of my head . " Now , we 'd better get going . Find yourself some black shoes , chop chop ! " <br> With a resentful sigh I get to my feet and drag myself into my bedroom . It 's a beautiful sunshiny day . And I get to spend it at a hideous family occasion involving a dead 105-year-old person . Sometimes life really sucks . <br> As we pull up in the drab little car park of the Potters Bar Funeral Center , I notice a small crowd of people outside a side door . Then I see the glint of a TV camera and a fluffy microphone bobbing above people 's heads . <br> " What 's going on ? " I peer out the car window . " Something to do with Uncle Bill ? " <br> " Probably . " Dad nods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " Mum puts in . " Trudy mentioned it . For his book . " <br> This is what happens when one of your relations is a celebrity . You get used to TV cameras being around . And people saying , when you introduce yourself , " Lington ? Any relation to Lingtons Coffee , ha ha ? " and them being gobsmacked when you say , " Yes . " <br> My uncle Bill is the Bill Lington , who started Lingtons Coffee from nothing at the age of twenty-six and built it up into a worldwide empire of coffee shops . His face is printed on every single coffee cup , which makes him more famous than the Beatles or something . You 'd recognize him if you saw him . And right now he 's even more high profile than usual because his autobiography , Two Little Coins , came out last month and is a bestseller . Apparently Pierce Brosnan might play him in the movie . <br> Of course , I 've read it from cover to cover . It 's all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought a coffee and it tasted so terrible it gave him the idea to run coffee shops . So he opened one and started a chain , and now he pretty much owns the world . His nickname is " The Alchemist , " and according to some article last year , the entire business world would like to know the secrets of his success . <br> Continues ...
