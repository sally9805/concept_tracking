After a dozen years of island life on Maui , Tama Starr decided to return to New York City in 1982 to join the family business , which her grandfather had founded : Artkraft Strauss , known for its innovative Times Square signs  --  and the giant ball it lowered each New Year 's Eve . She hoped to help her father , who had suffered a heart attack shortly after inheriting the business , to develop the company so it could thrive in the coming century . She knew it would n't be easy : her dad was irascible , and the place was " crawling with relatives , " not all of them productive . Fortunately , she was able turn to an old friend , " a super shrink who encouraged me to accept my own perceptions and not to assume I was the one who was crazy . " Ultimately she became president of an increasingly successful company . But she never told her father about the therapy . " He would have been furious , " she admits , " if he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's business culture , such taboos are disappearing fast . Members of family businesses are increasingly  --  and openly  --  using consultants trained as psychotherapists to deal with the complex emotional and psychological problems associated with succession . While there are no statistics on how many family businesses are seeking such help , psychologist Lee Hausner , founder of Glendale , Calif. - based consulting firm Doud/Hausner , has in recent years noted " an enormous recognition of soft , that is , interpersonal , family issues . " When she asks clients to list 25 issues of importance to them , " about 20 are soft , like sibling rivalry "  --  issues that are beyond the expertise of accountants or lawyers . <P> " If your basic problem is communication , a family therapist might be more important than a business consultant , " suggests Rob Singh , entrepreneurship professor at the University of the Pacific 's business school . " If you can open the communication lines and face issues , you can move on . " Neil Koenig , a psychologist from California and author of You Ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently included among his clients a family-business owner who is 93 , another who is 82 . " Fifteen , 20 years ago , these gentlemen would not have talked to someone like me . They would have thought what I had to say was just a bunch of baloney . " <P> As with psychotherapists in general , family-business counselors must have the respect of all family members and not be tainted by previous alliances with any individual . They must also have a strong business background . " This person has to understand strategic , estate and succession planning  --  and how a family can work together when power , money , positions and messed-up relationships are involved , " says David Kipper , president of Executive Psychological Consulting in Chicago and research professor at Roosevelt University 's School of Psychology . Attorneys , university business schools or groups like the Family Firm Institute , the Aspen Family Business Group or the Family Office Exchange may refer families to suitable psychotherapists.                   @ @
