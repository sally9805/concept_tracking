Headnote THE MONTHLY RIDE KNOWN AS CRITICAL MASS THAT TAKES OVER CITY STREETS AROUND THE WORLD IS UNCONTROLLABLE , UNPREDICTABLE , SOMETIMES RIFE WITH ILLEGAL ACTIVITY , AGGRESSION AND OUTRIGHT VIOLENCE - AND JUST MIGHT , BY THE WAY , CHANGE THE WORLD . There are three people in the photo , but the one who started it all is on the left . The time is September 1992 . The place is San Francisco 's hipster dive bar and guest house , Zeitgeist . The man is softly featured , with a blond shading of beard , and in almost all respects looks like an easygoing , next-door neighbor you 'd like to barbecue with . What we know about him is modest . He was born in New York City in 1957 and moved to Oakland with his family in 1967 . As the Summer of Love unfolded across Height Asbury , H. Rap Brown was arrested by the FBI and the buildup in Vietnam reached its peak , the man in the photo was a boy of 10 . He graduated from high school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took an unimportant , uninvigorating job as a word-processing temp in the city 's financial district . But in the photo , of course , none of that history is apparent-nor is the future , the momentous social movement the man has just sparked . The man is smiling , grinning really , and he 's wearing a silly cartoon-emblazoned T-shirt that reads , " Save the reindeer , ride a bike . " He and his buddies had just completed a group ride across the city 's downtown streets , a small , slightly subversive gathering the man was calling the Commute Clot . It was the last Friday of the month , and the idea , explained in a leaflet the man had copied at his place of business , was to " make our presence felt to ourselves and the rest of the city , and ride home together . " There were maybe 60 of them that first night , no more . Fifteen years after that photo was snapped at the end of a simple bike ride among friends , I find myself in the shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruiser-style rental bike with a broad , horseshoe-shaped handlebar and a slightly humiliating placard hanging from the top tube that shills " Go pedal . " Ordinarily , I might be slightly embarrassed to be spotted piloting such a getup , but amid the sea of several hundred cyclists streaming into the square , I am , for all intents , anonymous and quite unextraordinary . It 's an impressive turnout for a Critical Mass ride , but only considering that earlier in the day two Al-Qaeda car bombs were discovered a few blocks away in the West End . In Budapest earlier this year , 50,000 Critical Massers pedaled through the city on the last Friday of the month , paralyzing auto traffic . In Warsaw 's Plac Zamkmvy , where Masa Krytyczna is approaching its 10th anniversary , the multithousand weekly gathering is described as the living , breathing ( and occasionally wheezing ) heartbeat of the Central Europe underground . " You 've got to go to Budapest , " a swarthy London bike messenger named Pedro tells me . " It is wild . " He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maxim that " Life is like riding a bicycle . To keep your balance you must keep moving . " In the United States , Critical Mass has seeded itself in dozens of cities . It is always the same and never the same . There are no organizers . An announcement simply appears , sometimes on fliers and posters , sometimes in underground newsletters , more often now on the Web . The announcement states a gathering spot and a date , usually the last Friday of a month . Then cyclists-sometimes there are tens , most often hundreds , sometimes thousands-simply show up and ride , fanning out with a clarion call of ding-a-linging bike bells . The riders in front move slowly while self-appointed lieutenants fan out to the cross streets to prevent side traffic from slamming through the leisurely snaking main body . Either cell phones or relaying to-and-fro bike messengers coordinate the group and keep it together . Critical Mass rides have been called Woodstock on Wheels , which is especially true in San Francisco . On the April ride I saw elaborate bike displays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , regularly occurring cast of characters such as the Howler . ( He screams periodically , apparently out of uncontainable joy , when the others begin arriving each Friday . ) And there is Running Wolf , whom a riding companion pointed out . He had just returned to the pack after a tree sit , up in Berkeley . Perhaps enjoying the feel of terra firma-the campus redwood 's perch was 70 feet high-he simply runs alongside the elongated pack for much of the 20-mile , roughly two-hour ride . Loud , roaring club music is an integral part of the event , with specially outfitted bicycles carrying 12-volt generators and sound systems . It 's not uncommon for the smell of cannabis to mingle with the hoppy aroma of beer as , like a wasted book group on wheels , no-handed riders pass refreshments back and forth . There are bikes of all conceivable persuasions : choppers , track singlespeeds , BMX , mountain , English three-speeds , beach cruisers , recumbents , tandems , penny farthings and an amorphous homegrown category that might include , say , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloft pilot hovering 5 feet above Market Street . The pilots themselves do n't mind dressing up or dressing down . There are the usual San Francisco types-bike messengers in three-quarter-length jeans , vine-streaming Earth Mothers in organic flower and dark-haired men screaming " viva Ia revolution " while wielding Che Guevara flags-but there are also men in casual , sophisticated style ( a Sinatra-era fedora , for example , in place of a bike helmet ) and others who appear to have taken a wrong turn at Mardi Gras . I refer to the man in the one-piece grape-bunch suit and the individual whose exotic , multiwheel fish float features shiny silver scales made of old CDs . Happy-hour caf goers and hustling pedestrians stop and stare . Naturally , traffic comes to a snarled standstill wherever the ride elects to go . Motorists get steamed , and skirmishes sometimes occur . The cars ca n't go where they want to go when they want to go . The bikes can . The order of things is reversed . The motorized world is turned upside down . It 's for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ havoc . Where there are roundabouts , the thousands of triumphant riders , drunk with solidarity , might circle round for what seems like forever , or they might stop , and in a grandiose photo-op raise their bikes like John Cusack in the famous boom-box scene from Say Anything . The rides that are friendly are very friendly , but some are scary hostile , and some are absolute chaos . In the July 1997 Critical Mass in San Francisco-largely in response to then-mayor Willie Brown 's threat to crack down on the lawless mobs-some 5,000 cyclists oozed across the urban landscape like a vicious plague . Hundreds were arrested ( including the infamous , 8-inch phallusatop-the-helmet Dildo Man who was ticketed , he proudly proclaimed , for " blowing a red light " ) . Last year in New York City , police and riders clashed violently over the group 's constitutional right to gather . Dozens of squad cars blockaded the ride , leading to a degenerating sequence of events ( arrests , tickets and the confiscation of bicycles as " evidence " ) that drew worldwide expressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also spawned , as these things do , new rides in new places . This June there was another arrest in NYC when activist Bill Talen ( a.k.a . Reverend Billy ) refused to heed an officer 's request to put his bullhorn down and stop repeating the First Amendment at the top of his lungs . Neither officers nor Talen backed down , and Talen 's attorney quickly cheered the Critical Mass community with his defense : " Reverend Billy has a First Amendment right to recite the First Amendment . " Because there are no organizers , there is no way for local authorities to conventionally prepare . Several cities , such as New York and London , have taken Critical Mass to court , attempting to argue that thousands of riders gaily cruising in an unbroken clump through their streets is a parade and that parades need permits . The catch is that a procession must have an organizer .... And round and round it goes . The April San Francisco ride I did was a high-profile occasion . The previous month 's Critical Mass had gotten ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with five child passengers , tangled with riders who believed she 'd rammed a couple of them in her soccer-mom haste . Someone still unidentified shattered the van 's rear window by pitching a bicycle into it . As a result , the April ride drew the attention of the beleaguered mayor , Gavin Newsom , double the ordinary police detail , and a saturating air and ground media force ( including multiple TV news station trucks , helicopters whizzing overhead and intrepid head-camera-wearing , bicycle-riding reporters ) . " All the media did n't scare you away ? " asked a San Francisco Chronicle reporter of a dad who 'd brought his tot , but just as papa was winding up into a soliloquy on brave resistance he was shushed by his four-year-old , who wanted him to listen to the whirlybirds . In the noisy mob scene that began building at 5 p.m. at Justin " Pee Wee " Herman Plaza on Market Street , my plans to coordinate via cell phone with a veteran Critical Mass rider came undone because I could n't hear my phone ringing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Police estimated the crowd at 3,000 , but it felt larger , especially when riding near the front and looking down the hills at the swarming masses . It felt as if the Tribe of the Bike People , the long-bullied city transportation weaklings , had gone all Jack La Larme-bulked up , beaming and full of the feel-good gospel . We were unstoppable . " Remember , " announced someone with a wry grin , just as we were setting out , " no attacking minivans tonight . " There seemed to be an unspoken understanding that this ride 's vibe should be peace and restraint . " I was cutting a red light , " said a bike-shop kid from Walnut Creek who does three Critical Mass rides a month , " when somebody yanked me back by my backpack . " Here is what that " yank " seemed to concede : Critical Mass has at least as much ability to derail progress in bike advocacy-or at least distract from the task at hand-as improve the situation . Critical Mass is best at creating a scene , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolts of engineering improvements to the cycling infrastructure are best left to experts , which in San Francisco means to the long-running , ever-durable San Francisco Bicycle Coalition ( SFBC ) . Now a key , politically invested partner in city government , SFBC and its executive director , Lean Shahum , reminded people on the eve of the April Critical Mass ride that there was no official connection between the two groups . On the table in San Francisco were more than 60 cycling-improvement projects that could radically enhance the city cycling experience . " We are at a tipping point , " says Shahum , whose group now boasts 7,000 dues-paying members . The coalition had already seen huge increases in cycling 's share of Bay Area commuters ( 6 percent , according to Nick Carr , of the San Francisco MTA Bike Program , with a 10 percent goal by 2010 ) , and slowly had begun to change the car-first culture . But slow really does mean slow . The seemingly simple task of modifying a popular commuting roadway such as Valencia Street by adding a paint-partitioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedural delays from a determined and deeply entrenched opposition , one of whom had also filed a lawsuit to hold up all 60 of the approved bike-lane and bike-parking-related projects . As they battled the issues in courts and government meetings , bicycle advocates were asking their ambassadors-the city 's daily riders-to make gains in the court of popular opinion . That was a problem . There are cuckoos in the street-one-speed track-star wannabes who jet through red-light intersections and scream obscenities at tourists . Some rage not only at motorists and pedestrians , but also at each other . " It 's crazy out there , " says a bikeshop employee I spoke with . " Nobody knows how to ride-it 's not like Europe , believe me-and every time a light goes to green it 's like a hole shot . I 've been hit twice . " " Three times ! " hollers another guy , working in the back . That is everyday San Francisco , every day in any big city . Now , take those overcaffeinated riders , add the graying longhair with the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who come as circus clowns , and the guy wearing the unflattering George Bush mask , spice with an additional 2,000 assorted cyclists and you have a Critical Mass . This is why a person in Shahum 's position opens the weekend 's paper after the last Friday of the month like a student getting his SAT scores . No matter how well you think you 've done , you fear the worst . Even so , Shahum is n't anti-Critical Mass . She herself experienced what she describes as an awakening on a Critical Mass ride , which showed her in the course of a two-hour ride what " the possibilities could be . " I do n't ask her the specifics of the ride but most probably , like the one I was on , she cruised along the Embarcadero to Fisherman 's Wharf , then on to Union Square , the Castro area , Hayes Valley , Haight Street , Golden Gate Park , Ocean Beach and the Broadway Tunnel with multiple passes through North Beach and the area south of Market . It can be a giddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bike alone in city traffic . For a few hours the streets are safely yours . The group is like a force field , keeping the usual dark enemies at bay . You have time to wave , time to chat and time to drink in the cityscape . But then , just as everything seems hunky-dory , you might notice you are stopped for a prolonged period of time . You 're at the corner of Oak and Stanyon at the eastern edge of Golden Gate Park and the tribe is chanting with bicycles overhead , thumbing their collective noses at the hissing and steaming automobiles unable to get through . Someone 's sound system is cranking a rock anthem : " Cum on feel the noize , girls rock your boys , we 'll get wild , wild , wild .. . wild , wild , wild . " You notice a one-armed man slamming his truck door and coming right at you . He has large tattoos , enormous biceps and a burning-hot forehead that suggests something akin to what your Scottish father-in-law would call the " red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fun little outing as a personal insult . It is now that you know this might not be the safest way to spend your Friday night in the city after all . It is now that you know how a Critical Mass ride can quickly cross the fine line between blissful coexistence and the business side of an angry , one-armed truck driver . Fifteen years is a long time . In that time , Critical Mass has woven a colorful , interconnected human fabric , a rich and crazy tapestry that stretches from one end of the world to the other . Countless people have discovered cycling on temporarily welcoming urban avenues . Countless more have rediscovered their childhood love . Many have discovered human love-people have met and married after meeting on rides ( and probably argued and divorced because of them ) . Due to the movement 's longevity , families have grown up together on the rides . " My dad got me into this , " a 15-year-old from Walnut Creek told me when I asked her why she came . " See him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Many , many counterculture spin-off movements have been born in the course of Critical Mass rides . A small , Bay-area sampling glimpsed during my ride : RTS ( Reclaim the Streets ) , Uncivil Servants , Critical Manners . If you were the guy in the photo , the nearly accidental founder whose slightly worn-out idealism was about to spark an enduring global social phenomenon , and you were asked to predict the outcome of a decade-and-a-half of hundreds of thousands of people regularly practicing civil disobedience on their bicycles across the planet , you might not go so far as to imagine a truce with our gas-guzzling brethren of the road . But you might well anticipate a world brimming with bike lanes-or at least visible and effective signage . Improved air quality ? Safer roads ? A public debate about street congestion at least as vibrant as the back-and-forth about no-smoking laws or trans-fat bans ? Yet , even the most enthusiastic and loyal supporters glumly agree-I 'm thinking here of a man I met in London who identified himself as Professor Kayoss-that Critical Mass has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of our urban lives . " It has n't been all positive , " says Kayoss , founder of the Save the World Club . " The people who ride around London and take it seriously-well , they are n't really us . " The professor does n't apologize . Anarchy is fun , not purposeful . The strength of Critical Mass-nobody in control-may also be its most profound shortcoming . Chris Carlsson was 35 in 1992 , with no money , a young daughter and a vast number of radical political causes behind him . He had no way of knowing that his idea to take a ride at rush hour with some prankster-minded friends would become the most persistent , rambunctious , and messiest bicycling action in the world . When I finally interview Carlsson , who seems to be hesitant to speak definitively about his creation , he does admit he had early misgivings about the direction his idealism was taking . After those impromptu rides in San Francisco grew from 60 cyclists to 600 in a matter of months , he hastily constructed an unofficial Critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of force , abuse of the temporary power cyclists enjoyed over motorists and the mob mentality . But even by then , Critical Mass had taken on a life of its own , and what Carlsson thought was n't terribly relevant . Anarchy does n't politely ride inside the narrow , white-lined confines of a city bike lane . Carlsson , now 50 , recently seemed to again feel enough responsibility for his oddly numerous , ever multiplying , and often disruptive offspring that he tried once more to remind the brethren of the mischievious , fun-loving , disarming spirit of that first jaunt . Last winter he created a flier , also posted on chriscarlsson. com , to remind his San Francisco brethren " Why We Ride , " with a list of " dos and don'ts . " His daughter , a Critical Masser who cut her teeth on a chaotic ride in the summer of ' ' 96 , was among the first to object . " A little didactive sic , I think , Daddo , " she wrote in a comment on her father 's site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlsson was some bike-advocacy Albert Einstein attempting to rein in his work on the A-bomb-she undercut her criticism by sweetly signing her denunciation , " yr lovin daughter . " Today , Carlsson is sure of just one thing about the rides : There might not have been a 15th anniversary if people still called them Commute Clots . " I ca n't really explain it but Critical Mass is a name with an almost magical effect . It really caught on . " It is a rare sunny afternoon in an epically miserable London June when the wide South Bank plaza area along the Thames near Waterloo Bridge begins filling with bicycle riders . Naturally riders gravitate to their own sects-the bicycle world is hardly One World . The prim foldie people clutch to one another at the same time the ragtag couriers are gathering on another part of the plaza . The **29;5043;TOOLONG people are parked against the riverside rail , with one of their streamer-strewn bikes bearing the Utopian slogan " Ban cars yesterday . " This group 's solidarity-even including me , Go Pedal Man on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the other end of the plaza : a sizeable bicycle brigade of Metropolitan Police . Perhaps because of my one-armed man memories from San Francisco , or my repeated viewings of violent YouTube footage from New York , I sense trouble . The country is already on edge , with 50-year floods in the north and the morning news of the Al-Qaeda car bombs in downtown London . The terrorism alert in the United Kingdom is listed as severe . But at about 6:30 p.m. - urged on by an older man working himself against the grain of the crowd and saying a less-thaninflammatory " Shall we ? " - the ride is peacefully launched . A black-vested mountain bike cop spins next to a lady whose backpack sticker reads , " If you do n't hit me I wo n't fall down . " A guy who looks like Sly from the Family Stone throws a wheelie on a rig emblazoned with the block-lettered motto , " fuckin " criminal . " The pack floods forward , as aimless and cheerful and unhindered as a six-year-old on a birthday bike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feels remarkable to me . It seems to suggest an understanding , a bit of respect , perhaps , or at least tolerance . Critical Mass , I think , might actually be working in London . It feels a little more predictable , a lot less sensational , as if Dildo Man and Howler have yet to cross the pond . As it turns out , my impression is mostly correct . The London Critical Mass is more a part of the city than not-it 's cited in the popular event listings in Time Out as one of the " 101 More Things to Do Before You Leave London . " Unlike the capitals of Critical Mass in the United States , where sentiments can and often do turn dark quickly , Londoners do n't seem to expect the worst of each other . The lack of feistiness on both sides sometimes seems a drag- " Does anybody even care anymore ? " lamented a blogger prior to the spring rides-but the integration of ride and city means nobody is pissed off , nobody is getting personal . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bikes . It 's hard to say if Critical Mass is the catalyst to all the things that make London , in the mayor 's rosy view , the next great cycling city . But at least it 's not getting in the way . Critics of Critical Mass say that cycling 's increased popularity in London-there has been an 83 percent increase in bicycle trips into the city since 2000-is a direct result of infrastructure improvements and a central London driving toll that has lessened auto traffic , and is in spite of Critical Mass rather than because of it . They also point out that the police have worked hard to squelch the ride , or at least control it . In a yearlong legal battle , a court recently affirmed the Metropolitan police department 's contention that Critical Mass is a " procession " and as such must apply for a permit on each of its Friday rides . But even in that argument there is a friendlier official attitude to Critical Mass than is found in the United States . The Friends of the Earth environmental group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but whatever the decision , police spokesmen say they are n't inclined to shut down the ride . Jenny Jones , the former deputy mayor of London , now a Green Party London Assembly member and still an occasional CM participant , even went so far as to encourage cyclists to show up for a post-courtdecision protest ride in May . Her 500-word appeal in the May 25 Guardian described Critical Mass as a " little cultural gem in London life ... one of those mixed-up expressions of dissent , fun and celebration that is also untidy and slightly chaotic at times , but London was born that way . " The mayor himself , though not riding in Critical Mass , did n't antagonize the situation nor question its right to exist , as some U.S. city leaders have . In fact , at the same time he was welcoming the Tour de France to London for its opening two stages in July , he announced a cyclist-and-pedestrian takeover of central London on September 23 . Automobile traffic would be forbidden , with the idea of getting more bums on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Says Tom Bogdanowicz , of London Cycling Campaign , the city 's leading advocacy group , " It 's basically the official version of Critical Mass . " When one goes hunting down answers as to how Critical Mass successfully coexists with city officials in London , the destination is obvious : Professor Kayoss 's abode , in Surrey . The good professor the Friends of Earth appealed the Critical Mass court decision . Kayoss ( his real name is Des Kay ) is short and stout , with twinkling blue eyes and a gray mane of hair pulled back into a ponytail . When he walks me the short distance back from the tube stop to his home-he dubs it the Monkey House on account of its Gibbon Road address-he explains that he is a moderate in his interpretation of Critical Mass . It is , he says , a " celebration of cycling " - no more , no less . " That 's the shared ideal . Individually everybody has their own agendas , of course , but that has never gotten in the way of us all going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first London Mass in 1994 that the event was definitely " for me . " By way of explanation he shows me around . Bikes and costumes are everywhere . A little threewheeled hot dog cart is , he says , " the amazing , cycle-powered answer-to-everything machine . " It is a big hit with kids , adds Kayoss , whose rambling storage shed of a house spills out other salvaged items he uses in the earth-hugging performances he does at schools and festivals . Bikes predominate , but umbrellas are n't far behind . " I 've probably got a thousand of them , " he estimates of the umbrellas . I ask him about a story I heard about one of the earliest London rides , when a small band of riders made love to their bikes on the doorstep to 10 Downing Street , complete with humping gyrations and a hard-mashing , bike-on-bike orgy to cap the affair . Professor Kayoss smiles . Perhaps , I suggest , hoping for a good quote or insight , that is the difference between London and other cities : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not bike war . Kayoss smiles some more , and I get the feeling he 's still thinking about that free-love ride . And that smile , really , says it all . Chris Carlsson is more like Professor Kayoss than the San Francisco Bike Coalition 's Leah Shahum or London 's Jenny Jones-or the one-armed truck driver , or , for that matter , the cyclist who threw a bike through that soccer mom 's window . Carlsson has described the hotheads at the edgy front of Critical Mass as the " testosterone brigade . " The people who seek to duel with motorists , to overpower them , have it all wrong-as do the well-meaning people who want to impose order . Carlsson just wishes more of us valued the social connectedness of a bicycle ride-that it can make the world a better place simply through the epiphanies that come from meeting strange new folks who do strange , wonderful things . Critical Mass really is about Howler howling and Tree Sitter running . It 's never ever been about bike lanes , congestion ordinances , parking racks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride than to say all this stuff .

Critical Mass in Macomb , Illinois ( pop : 18,422 ) , draws fewer than 20 cyclists each month , which unofficial ride founder Jeff Calhoun considers a success . " That is more than one out of every 1,000 of the entire town population , " he says . " That would be like a ride of 3,000-plus riders in Chicago .

" We made strips of paper telling about the ride with opposing side-slits cut in each strip , which allows them to be formed into a self-fastening loop , with no tape or staples required , " he says . " People who want to get the word out fasten the loops around bikes parked around town . " Macomb 's only bike shop now advertises the ride as well . Unlike other cities , Macomb 's Critical Mass attracts positive attention from local officials-one city council member even joined a ride .
