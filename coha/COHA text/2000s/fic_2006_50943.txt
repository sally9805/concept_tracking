Matthew Hughes first introduced us to the noonaut Guth Bandar in " A Little Learning " in out June 2004 issue . ( You can find the story online at www.archonate.com ) Since then we 've followed Guth 's adventures as they have taken him through some strange sections of the collective unconscious and gotten him kicked out of the Institute . Now we find him working in his uncle 's housewares emporium when trouble comes seeking him again .... <p> GUTH BANDAR SPENT THE morning attending to occasional customers in his Uncle Fley 's housewares vendory and , between those encounters , constructing a decorative display of insipitators . The devices had lately become hugely popular among the inhabitants of Boderel , a self-contained district of the ancient city of Olkney on whose main thoroughfare stood Bandar 's Mercantile Emporium and to which Guth Bandar had returned after being dismissed from his post as an adjunct scholar at the Institute for Historical Inquiry . At first , he had stacked the insipitators in a pyramid , but soon realized that the arrangement was a deterrent to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or risk an avalanche of the squat , rotund appliances . And since Bandar had needed to mount a folding step to position the pyramid 's upper strata , the customer who could reach for the apex insipitator would have to be freakishly tall . After two purchasers had required him to fetch and unfold the step so he could hand them down the highest item , he realized his error and tore down the stack . He rearranged the devices on a series of terraced shelves , allowing persons of varying heights to reach the insipitator that was closest to hand . Bandar sighed heavily as he labored . He found the work tedious and dull , far less interesting than had been his explorations of the noosphere , the grand collective unconscious of humanity , whose study was the purpose of the venerable Institute . But that phase of his life now lay behind a door that had slammed shut , to remain forever sealed against him . His longstanding academic rival , the detestable Didrick Gabbris , had roused the Institute 's Grand Colloquium . Faculty , students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Commons , as the collective unconscious was known to scholars , had paradoxically achieved consciousness of itself-and not only self-awareness , but a will to act . Worse than heretical , the scholars found the idea to be novel . And being offered to a conclave of academics on the ancient planet Old Earth , where no new idea had emerged in scores of millennia , it was received with shock , outrage , and derision . Gabbris had skillfully orchestrated the different streams of opprobrium , playing the Grand Colloquium as a conductor leads an orchestra , achieving at the end a crescendo of repudiation that sped a thoroughly disgraced Guth Bandar back to Boderel . A plurality of the Boderel district 's inhabitants were adherents of the Concord of Astringency , a philosophical system that prized rigorous sobriety and self-denial . For the past several years there had been a gradual loosening of the Concord 's strictures , accompanied even by the use of sweeteners in the weekly ceremonial of the gruel , but now a new First Locutor had wrested the leadership from the backsliders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing uncomfortable fabrics and eating only foods whose flavor had been removed by insipitators . As he stacked and sold the devices , Bandar thought to see a convergence between his situation and that of his customers : he found his new life both tasteless and a source of chafing . He was mulling this thought when the who's-there at the emporium 's front door chirped the first words of its customary greeting to an incoming customer , then abruptly changed its tone and choice of words ; its percepts had recognized that the tall , thin man coming through the portal was Fley Bandar , the proprietor . Guth Bandar left the insipitator display and went to greet his relative , putting on as cheerful a face as he could manage . After all , his troubles were no fault of his uncle 's and the man had been generous to take him in and give him a livelihood . " Ho , uncle , " he said , " the insipitators are moving well . You may need to order fresh stock . " Ordinarily , such news should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a commerciant to his core and lived to sell useful products at a decent mark-up . But now Bandar saw that the older man 's face remained long , his brows pulled into a troubled vee and his lips downdrawn at the corners . " What is the matter ? " Bandar said . He received only a sigh for an answer . Fley took his customary seat on a stool behind the device that recorded transactions , bowed his grayed head and clasped his hands across his midriff . After a moment , he looked up at his nephew and said , " There is a problem . " Bandar instantly felt an urge to assist his uncle in meeting the challenge . He had noticed that whenever the older man faced a challenge , be it so minor as a need to rearrange the merchandise in the front display area , Bandar experienced a surge of motivation and felt good about himself when he was able to make a contribution . " What is the problem ? " he said . " How may I assist you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There has been a change , " he said . " A change ? " Bandar 's face arranged itself into an icon of bepuzzlement . " What change ? There is never a change . " He spoke from the authority of universal knowledge . In Olkney , nothing ever changed . Eons before , history had come to a complete and final end . Everything that could be tried had been tried , all possible forms had been established , filled with content , then emptied and refilled countless times . There was not , could not be , anything new under the fading orange light of the senescent sun . " What can have changed ? " " Tshimshim Barr-Chevry has sold up and moved offworld . A new man has taken over his enterprise . He has announced a program of direct competition with us . It was the talk of the guild meeting this morning . " Bandar blinked . " What does it mean , direct competition ? Are we to run races , do puzzles in our heads ? " His uncle sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the new incumbent will sell the same goods as we , but at lower prices . Also , he will offer inducements . For example , persons who purchase the new man 's insipitators will receive a corrugated pillow , free of charge . " " Madness , " Bandar said . " Barr-Chevry 's does not sell insipitators . They sell immovables and interactive decor . Thus has it always been , through all the generations of Barr-Chevrys . " " Not anymore , " said Fley . " Apparently , the latest iteration of the Barr-Chevry line had long harbored a secret desire to roam the open savannahs of distant worlds , places where moons pass through the skies and strange scents waft on the breezes . " Bandar made a fricative noise of dismissal . " We all have our fantasies . I dreamed of being a noonaut , - much good it did me . " " Tshimshim Barr-Chevry has converted his fantasy into a ticket on a spaceliner that lifted off before dawn . By now he has passed through the first whimsy and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a deep breath , rose and walked a few paces , then turned and retraced his steps , his thin legs bending at the knee and his elongated feet slapping the well-worn floor . His head was bowed and his brows knit . " Who is this new man ? " Bandar said . " Perhaps he is unaware of how things are done . We can arrange for his erroneous views to be corrected . " " That is the strangest part , " said Fley , pausing in his " perambulations and turning to his nephew . " He is only a placeholder , employed by the true purchaser of the enterprise , who sits behind a shield of anonymity . " " You 're saying the owner does not operate the business ? I 've never heard the like . " Fley sighed again and resumed his pacing . " It is decidedly peculiar , " he said . " Yet , there it is . The issue before us is : how to respond ? " Bandar felt another flash of incentive . " You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand with you . " Fley rang a finger down his lengthy nose while his eyebrows performed a shrug . " I suppose we must , " he said . " It 's good of you to take my side , Guth . " " It 's what I 'm here for , " said Guth Bandar and was surprised to find how deeply rang those simple words in his being . " Now , what we need is a plan . " " I wish to inquire as to the proprietorship of a business , " Bandar told the integrator at the Archonate Bureau of Cognizance . " Why do you want to know ? " " How is my motive relevant ? " " Are you saying it is not ? " said the bland voice . Bandar was alone in the small booth yet the words seemed to be spoken in the air just behind his left ear . " You seek information in which you have no interest ? This seems a feckless pursuit . Are you normally governed by your every passing whim ? " Bandar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in continuous service for durations more closely measured by geological periods than by human lifetimes , even the lengthy spans of Old Earth 's inhabitants in this , the planet 's penultimate age . The devices developed quirks and odd enthusiasms , and some of them appeared to take a perverse delight in putting difficulties in the way of the citizens they purported to serve . " My motive is concern for the wellbeing of a close relative , " Bandar said . " How so ? " Reluctantly , Bandar explained the circumstances , knowing that each detail might send the integrator off on a wild tangent , requiring perhaps an entire afternoon to work it back to the point of his inquiry . Fortunately , however , the device was as nonplused by the news of the new policy at Barr-Chevry 's as he had been . " What is the alleged purpose of this competition ? " the integrator asked . " That has not been made known to us , only the fact of its existence . " " But this smacks of disruptive behavior . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Terfel III . Why disturb perfection ? " " Exactly , " said Bandar . " Hmmm , " said the integrator . " Might this transaction be illegal ? " There was a pause while the device consulted eons of codified law . " It appears not . " " But it is not a trend the Archonate would wish to encourage . " The integrator 's tone grew distant . " It is not a trend at all , merely an instance . Perhaps someone has gone mad . " " So an appeal to the Archon is not indicated ? " " It rarely is , " said the integrator . Bandar knew that the Archon was empowered to do anything at all to anyone at all , although ordinarily he was disinclined to interfere in the balance of affairs . " Yet this situation might constitute an imbalance , or at least the beginning of one , " he said . " Indeed . " The integrator was silent for a moment , then said , " Do you wish to hear my optimum counsel ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very well . Keep in mind that the Archon sits at the very pinnacle of the social order . His view of what is best and proper originates from a unique perspective . Those who invite his intervention can sometimes receive much more help than they anticipated . Indeed , occasionally it is more help than they can bear . " " What do you mean ? " " For example , " said the integrator , " there was the dispute between two aristocratic families that occupied the large island in Mornedy Sound . They disagreed bitterly as to which should have precedence over the other . After an escalating series of violent incidents , culminating in arson and mayhem , they appealed to the Archon Barthelmeon VIII for a judgment . " " Wait a moment , " said Bandar , " there is no large island in Mornedy Sound . " " Exactly , " said the integrator . " Now , do you wish to involve the Archon in your uncle 's dispute ? " " Perhaps not . " " Then , good day . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for : the name of the new owner of Barr-Chevry 's Immovables . " " Very well . " The integrator then made a sound that indicated mild interest . " There has been some attempt to disguise the ownership through a chain of reciprocal hand-offs and cut-outs - not an entirely clumsy attempt , at that , but the trail leads back to one person . " " And that person is ? " " His name is Didrick Gabbris . " " Why do you torment my uncle ? " Bandar said . Didrick Gabbris voiced no reply , merely placed his nose in an elevated position and made to step away . But Bandar seized the man 's elbow through the sleeve of his academic robe , spun him around and repeated the question . He had intercepted Gabbris beneath the stand of tittering hissol trees in the smaller quadrangle of the Institute of Historical Inquiry . It was late afternoon . Gabbris had just finished hearing a pack of undergraduates deliver the results of their conjectural flights - or " hunchmanship " as the exercise was colloquially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masters " lesser conclave that would occupy the hour before the bell called all to dinner . Bandar had come directly from Olkney by hired aircar to find his old enemy fast-stepping through dappled orange sunlight , doubtless with thoughts of spiced cordial and seeded buns foremost in his mind . " I am not answerable to you , " Gabbris said . He sought to pull his arm from Bandar 's grip but could not . He looked around for help but saw only a gaggle of students from his hunchmanship session , all of whom seemed interested in seeing their tutor accosted , none of whom showed an inclination to intervene . Bandar increased the pressure of his grip . " Expect no aid , " he said . " You have never inspired sympathy . " " Let go of me or it will go ill with you , " Gabbris said . Bandar made a noise that mingled derision with hate . " What will you do ? " he said . " Have me expelled ? You forget , you have already taken from me all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to face with an angry man who has nothing to lose . I also point out that , though you are taller , I am wiry and well coordinated . Finally , I am mightily motivated to cause you pain and humiliation . " " I would see you clapped into a cell in the Archon 's contemplarium , " Gabbris said , but the squeak in his voice leached any power from his threat . " Indeed ? " said Bandar , letting his expression assume a thoughtful aspect . " And what I 'd be contemplating would be the memory of your tear-stained face , blood and mucous streaming from its disarranged nose , as I stood over you and applied the toe of my boot to the softest parts of your person . " " You would n't dare . " Bandar yanked on Gabbris 's arm to position his enemy while he turned his free hand into a fist and drew it back in preparation for launch . A hoot of anticipation came from the undergraduates . " Wait ! " Gabbris said . " Only long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholar tried again to pull his arm free but the motion was more petulant than determined . " Very well , " he said . " It came to me in a dream . " " A lucid dream ? " " Of course . " " Ambiguous ? " " Not to a noonaut . " Gabbris 's lips slid back into their habitual sneer and his brows rose to their usual supercilious heights to offer Bandar an unspoken corollary : Which you are not . Bandar released the man 's arm and uncocked his fist . A tenured fellow of the Institute could not be faulted for acting upon a clear message from the unconscious . " What was the import ? " he said . " That the enmity between us must continue . You must be further punished , through your uncle . " Bandar made a gesture of bewilderment . " It makes no sense , " he said . " What has Fley done to merit a penalty ? " " I do not question what comes from the Commons , " Gabbris said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are as accepting as a .... " His mind offered him a rude and scatological image but he did not voice it . " Are we done ? " Gabbris said . " I desire a cordial and some conversation . " He stressed the next three words : " With my peers . " " Surely you recognize that this role that has been assigned to you is consistent with my contention that the Commons has achieved self-awareness and is pursuing an agenda . " Gabbris waved away the supposition like a man brushing off a lethargic fly . " That again ? " he said . " The only consistency I recognize is your continual harping on a self-deluding fantasy . " " But why else would you be urged to trouble me , now that you have won and I have lost ? " " The Commons is its own rationale . " Gabbris quoted . " It is the constant mirror in which we are but flickering reflections , ephemeral and substanceless . We do not question what comes from its depths ; rather , we act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the slight height that his small stature could achieve . " Very well , " he said , " but know that I return home to seek a lucid dream of my own , and if it should counsel me to wreak havoc on your repulsive carcass , be assured that havoc will be thoroughly wreaked . " IT WAS LATE in the evening by the time Guth Bandar made his way back from the Institute . All during the ride on the balloon tram and the subsequent long walk through the streets of Olkney , thronged with indentors and their spouses promenading their fashionable attire , coiffures , and skin coloration , he had mulled what Gabbris had told him . A portion of his mind niggled at him , holding out a tantalizing whiff of some forgotten but crucial factum that was the key to unlock the mystery . But each time he rallied his normally well disciplined and biddable memory , it shied away from the target like a missile that did not care to make impact . His uncle had already retired upstairs to his sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of his uncle 's vendory , reposed himself upon the sleeping pallet and cleared his consciousness . He slowed his breathing and placed his limbs in the approved positions , then closed his " eyes and summoned a mental image of a staircase with himself at the top and shadows beneath . Releasing a long sigh of breath , he pictured himself descending , step by step , at a measured pace . Within moments he found himself in a familiar setting . He was walking along the main concourse of the Institute 's New Quadrangle , an ancient labyrinth in whose warren of rooms senior fellows tutored mid-level students in the intricacies of the Commons 's myriad Locations and the subtle techniques by which they could be entered and exited . The wide hallway was lined on either side by doors that led into rooms great or small , the former for lectures , the latter for exercises in meditation . As Bandar strode along , he noticed that one door a short distance down the concourse was limned in rosy , golden light . He stepped to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He entered and with the crossing of the threshold came memory - though it arrived , not as a helpmate ready to serve , but as an unwelcome intruder . He turned to retreat back through the door but found that the portal was gone . Once again , he was in a formless mist , out of which came the ever shifting shape of the Multifacet : that representation of the collective unconscious that had paradoxically become conscious , and that had chosen Cuth Bandar , whether he wished it or not , to be the instrument of its will . " You have done this , " Bandar said . " You have sicced the odious Gabbris on my good uncle , who has done none harm and merits no punishment . " He spoke to a cartoonish representation of an animal wearing an odd hat and some sort of ribbon that went around its neck and hung down its front - Bandar thought the original species must be long extinct - that replied in a buffoonish voice that changed in midsentence to a cackle as the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of persons . We do what must be done . " " If you wish my help , " Bandar said , " then enlist me . Do not coerce me by threatening those I love . " " We do as we must , " said the Multif acet , becoming a roly-poly fellow in scarlet tunic and trousers accented by white fur and a matching tasseled hat . " You must be shaped , and we must use the tools at hand . " " What if I refuse ? " A little girl in pigtails and pinafore looked up at him and said , " We will seek another , but the train of events has already begun and your uncle is now in play . " " He is a good man , " Bandar said . " He deserves better . " " Deserts do not come into it , " said a fanged and hulking nightmare . " It is about survival . " " Whose ? " A woman with impossibly long legs , an unnaturally buoyant bosom , and a husky contralto said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Even yours ? " " Even ours , " said a rosy-countenanced infant . " It is your destiny to help . Accept it . " " But I am not a Helper . My conformation has the seeker dominant , influenced by the Wise Man and the Solitary , shadowed by the Hoarder . " He referred to the archetypes that blended together to form the core elements of his psyche . They had been delineated when he first applied to study at the Institute . The figure before him made no answer but abruptly disappeared , to be replaced by a rippling rent in the mist . Hating the necessity , Bandar stepped into it . At first he was aware only of the Landscape : a vast sky of a paler blue than that which covered Old Earth in its penultimate age , the sun yellow and hot , the clouds above the horizon a pristine white . The land itself was mostly flat , with here and there a gentle roll . A constant wind stirred its covering of dry grass and scrub . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock , level on top and formed from striated layers of age-hardened sediments , some attended by solitary spires of stone shaped by no hand but the weather 's . He knew that it would be more than just a place . The Multifacet would have dropped him into at least a Situation , perhaps a complex Event , and he and Uncle Fley would be players in it . He had sought a lucid dream , in which his nonaut training would have given him considerable power to mold his environment . But this setting had all the hallmarks of an established Location somewhere in the matrix that was the Commons . Experimentally , he summoned his skills and attempted to still the wind . It blew on without regard for his efforts . Next he tested his voice . The single tone rang clear in the fresh air , though it was more of a tenor than Bandar 's own baritone . At least this time they have not muted me , he thought . If I wish , I can summon an emergency gate and awaken in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Location was his innocent uncle , threatened by evil forces and with only his nephew Guth to help him withstand them . I must discover the dynamics of this Location , work out the direction of events , then resolve them in our favor . It was a flagrant violation of all that a noonaut stood for . Explorers of the Commons observed while unobserved , insulated from the perceptions of the idiomatic entities by the thrans that they constantly sang . It was dangerous to interfere with the workings of Events or Situations : the idiomats were not people but bundles of simplified traits and habitual responses ; intervening in a way that distorted their preordained roles brought disharmony , generating a psychic friction that rapidly built up energies that discharged violently . He gave the environment one more searching look and , seeing nothing amiss , examined himself . Once again , he had been deposited into the virtual flesh of an idiomat . Looking down , he saw a checked shin and a wide belt with a heavy buckle . Below that were tan trousers of some sturdy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thumbs of sun-browned and work-hardened hands were tucked . From the turned up cuffs of the pants emerged a pair of worn boots with pointed toes . He became aware of the idiomat 's thoughts : simple satisfaction at being out on his own , trusted with some minor but serious task . That is different , Bandar thought . When the Multifacet had dropped him into the Event known as The Rising of the Oppressed , the persona of the idiomat into which he had been placed had been completely expunged . This time , Bandar seemed to be an addition to a persona that came equipped with its own inner life . That raised the question of whether the nonaut had control over his host 's actions . He doubted that he would be a mere passenger , but suppressing the idiomat 's will entirely might cause disharmony . To test his influence , Bandar gently urged a turn to the right . The idiomat shifted his weight and gazed idly in the suggested direction . Bandar next tried a nose scratching and was rewarded with success . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host 's taking an action and it would happen - so long as it was within the idiomat 's repertoire . Willing an idiomatic entity to do something far out of character would render it disharmonious , and the nonaut did not wish to be trapped in the flesh of an idiomat on a rampage . It was time to seek out Uncle Fley and do whatever the Multifacet wanted done . Let 's go , he thought , and the idiomat turned around , giving Bandar a view of a large , long-legged beast to which was strapped a contraption of leather and metal . Bandar had seen such beasts in many Locations that dated from the dawn-time , when they were ridden or used to pull primitive wheeled vehicles . Clearly this variant of whatever Situation he had been thrust into was from far back in the Deep Past , before the discovery of inherent motilation or even submolecular circuitry . Now as he looked at the beast , the word " horse " came into his mind , and even as he thought it , he realized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung from a leather strap . A moment later , Bandar was surveying the scene from a higher vantage point . He eased back on his control of his host so that it could go about its business . Bandar would watch and learn until it became clear what he was expected todo . His host tugged on the leather straps - the word " reins " popped into Bandar 's vocabulary as he focused on the items - and the animal 's head veered to the right . The rest of its body followed as the idiomat 's boot heels thumped into its ribs . They set off at a " canter " across the Landscape , the wind of their passage tugging at a broad-brimmed hat that Bandar found he was wearing . He contented himself with observing and over the next few minutes felt his vocabulary filling up with the jargon of this Location . Not far off , he came to what he realized was the idiomat 's intended destination-a patch of prairie not much different from any other , except that it featured a wire fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap , and a muddle of tracks made by a herd of animals with split hooves . The idiomat 's eyes followed the tracks . They led up a gentle slope and he kicked his horse after them , coming to a broad crest from which the land fell away into a wide depression . In the middle distance moved a cloud of dust in which Bandar could see idiomats on beasts like his , slapping rope " lariats " against saddles and hooting as they drove forty or fifty " cattle " before them . The idiomat 's heels hit the horse 's side again and he shouted some wordless syllable that obviously had meaning to the horse , because the beast broke into a sudden gallop . Bandar marveled at the smooth ease with which his host sat his saddle as the animal sped down into the basin , its ears flattened and its long neck hair - " mane " - streaming back over the hands that held the reins . Man and beast rapidly closed the distance to catch up with the herd . They swung wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the herd , the idiomat rearing his horse onto its hind legs , shouting hoarsely and waving his hat . The oncoming cattle shied and milled about , making sounds of distress . Out of the dust came three men on horseback , dressed roughly in the same fashion as Bandar 's host , though something about them gave the impression that they were of a different sort . Henchmen , the nonaut decided . Then he listened as his host spoke . " Those are our cattle ! " He 's younger than I thought , Bandar decided , angry , but also frightened . One of the men urged his mount closer . In one hand was a long barreled weapon - " rifle " - laid casually over his saddle . Using only his knees , the Henchman skillfully directed his horse to turn broadside to Bandar 's idiomat , and now the rifle 's dark orifice was pointing Bandar 's way . A cruel smile formed on the tanned and stubbled face and the man said , " Ca n't be yours , kid . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our fence , drove them off , " said Bandar 's host , and hearing the high-pitched voice again confirmed his first impression : he was in the body of an idiomat on the cusp between boy and man . " Now that ai n't a nice thing to say , " said the man with the rifle . The dust was blowing away and Bandar saw two more riders moving out to either side of the confrontation , both armed , both handling their weapons with a casual familiarity that argued that there would be no hesitation in using them . " You say things like that , " said the one with the rifle , who looked to be a Chief Henchman , " you better be ready to back " em up . Man do n't have to take that kind of talk , specially from some wet-nosed kid . " Bandar was worried by the anger that was now clouding what there was of the idiomat 's mind . If the boy made the wrong move in this confrontation the man with the rifle might well fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn out to be the Helper in this Situation , his death therefore highly unlikely this early in the dynamic . But it would not help if he had to solve the puzzle while physically incapacitated . Besides , he did not know what pain felt like to an idiomat and did not care to find out through experimentation . He exerted his will to keep the boy 's hands on the reins . But he did n't take control of the idiomat 's mouth . " You wo n't get away with this , " the boy said . " My pa 'll kill you . " The other two henchmen had moved closer . One of them , a skinny man with a thin mustache , sneered and spat a stream of brown liquid , while the other , heavyset with a week 's stubble on his jaw , said , " Sure , kid . We 're scared to death . " The one with the rifle said , " Tell your old man if he 's got anythin " to say , he knows where to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bandar could see where this narrative was heading . It was a Situation , probably a variation on the motif of Resisting the Despot . This Strayhorn would be a Principal in this Location , a local Tyrant imposing his will upon a Suffering Population that was too timid to revolt and overthrow him . His host 's father was probably also a Principal , the Hero of this tale , and the sequence of events would climax in a confrontation between the two , from which only one would emerge alive . Which of the two that would be was uncertain : Heroes came in a wide variety of types , and Bandar would need to take a close look at the father before he could establish whether the idiomat was of the Reluctant , or the Pure , or even the Sacrificial type . He doubted that this Situation would include an Accidental or an Unlikely Hero , and was already confident that he would not find a cynical Antihero when they returned to wherever the boy had come from . In any case , Bandar was clearly once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Multifacet 's purpose in enlisting him to play the same role he had played in The Rising of the Oppressed . Of course , repetition of themes was a commonplace of the Commons , he thought , so it should not come as a surprise that , having become conscious , the nosphere should demonstrate a tendency toward the redundant . Now was not a good time to mull these matters , Bandar knew . Fley was not in any of the Henchmen so it was time to move on . He exerted more control over the youth , causing him to pull the horse 's head in the direction from which they had come and energetically ride away . As they went , Bandar paid attention to the setting , noting that the grass and scrub seemed well realized . The horse and its equipment also exhibited a wealth of detail , enough that Bandar felt comfortable in classifying this Location as a Class Two Situation , scoring high on the Realism scale . That meant that if , for example , his idiomat fell from his mount at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones , possibly internal injuries , and even death if he landed the wrong way . The idiomat was determined to get home and report the theft of the cattle . Bandar was sure that would be the Initiating Incident of this Situation . He would know the Hero 's type once he saw how the news was received ; that would give him a reasonably good idea of where all this was heading , and some sense of where to look for Fley . He let the boy guide the horse through the broken fence and across the rolling landscape until they came to a small valley bisected by a shallow river . Down below was a house made of logs , a couple of outbuildings and an enclosure - " corral " - of posts and rails surrounding three more horses . The boy set the horse to angle down the slope and Bandar left them to their business while he surveyed the scene . The level of detail intensified here , supporting his belief that this was the seat of a Principal . When in response to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as they splashed through the river , a man came out onto the house 's open porch , the nonaut 's expectation was confirmed : Pa was a fully detailed Class One idiomatic entity , tall and muscular , with lines of character etched into the planes of his face and subtlety in his light-colored eyes . The work clothes he wore had the same lived-in look as the boy 's attire . Bandar only half listened to the exchange between the two as the boy leapt from the saddle and breathlessly told his parent about the Initiating Incident . He was looking for telltales that would define this Hero . He had already added Flawed to the list of rejected types , and judging by the worry that he saw in the older idiomat 's eyes as the boy told of confronting the three Henchmen , he was also ready to dismiss Pure as an option - a Pure Hero 's eyes would have blazed with righteous anger . This one looked more tired than angry . The boy was looking directly at the older idiomat as he spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view to study the Principal . As he allowed the impression to intensify , using a mentalism that was part of any trained nonaut 's tool-kit , something tugged at the edge of his mind . He sensed something familiar about Pa , something in the face that underlay the features and formed the essence of the idiomat 's character . The boy had finished his story . The Principal 's brows drew down and his eyes lost their focus as he looked inward at some memory . Reluctant Hero , Bandar told himself , not for certain , but definitely most likely . Then , as the father stroked his nose with a thoughtful finger , the " something familiar " leaped at Bandar and seized his full attention . " Uncle Fley ! " His cry sounded strange as he heard it in the still unsettled voice of the youth . The Principal acted as any Class One idiomat should at being confronted with disharmonious information . He paused , startled , then like an actor when a fellow cast member speaks a Une out of sequence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His face regained a mood of introspection . The boy , who had been equally startled at what had come from his own mouth , also returned to the flow of the Situation . " What are we going to do , Pa ? " he said . The Principal crossed to a water barrel and dipped up a mouthful , his eyes squinting into the westering sun as he drank . " I need to think about that , Mark , " he said . And I need to think about what 's going on here , Guth Bandar thought to himself . Because when he had glimpsed the resemblance to his uncle in the Principal 's expression and blurted out his relative 's name , he had seen more than a jolt of surprise appear in the older idiomat 's eyes . For a moment , the face that had looked back at Bandar was deeply familiar . Just as Bandar had been inserted into the Helper 's virtual flesh , his Uncle Fley was trapped within the Hero 's . REPETITION IS REALITY was one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Institute . By definition , nothing that happened in the Commons happened only once . The constantly recycling Events and Situations were distillations of events and situations in the waking world that had happened so many times , in all their varieties and permutations , that their essences had become part of humanity 's psychic machinery . Anything that had occurred no more than once or twice was not retained . Bandar considered this hoary truth as he struggled to maintain his composure . The worst mistake he could make was to let himself be caught up in the drama of the situation . If he allowed himself to be consumed by worry for his uncle , he would be drawn more deeply into the dynamics of this Situation . He might become lost in its movements , and thus unable to help Fley . Repetition , he repeated . It 's not only how the Commons works , but how it teaches . The Multifacet wanted him to learn something , and this was its method of instruction . The last time it had plunged him into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hero he had scarcely had time to know before events moved rapidly to the crisis . Now he was cast in the same role , but the intensity had been raised by the infusion into the Hero 's persona of someone he cared for deeply . Raise the stakes was another rule in the Commons : these kinds of Events and Situations always proceeded on an upward gradient of tension and conflict , culminating in a cathartic climax and an emotion-drenched denouement . The oxymoron that was the conscious unconscious was working to its own inbuilt rules , as if it were itself governed by unconscious drives . For a moment Bandar stopped to consider that the phenomenon of a conscious unconsciousness 's unconscious would make a truly interesting paper , then decided now was surely not the time . Very well , he told himself , there is no way out but to see this through to the end . He would play out the dynamic of the Situation , abiding by the rules . Uncle Fley ought to take no hurt from being attached to a Reluctant Hero . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell Bandar in the morning about a particularly vivid dream-if any memory of these events even clung to his waking mind . While Bandar had been thinking , events had moved on in the Situation . The father was now carrying a rifle similar to the one the Henchman had pointed at the boy . He had led a horse from the corral and was tightening the broad leather strap- " girth " - that looped under its belly . He slipped the weapon into a scabbard attached to the saddle , then swung up onto the horse . The boy did likewise with his own mount . They wheeled the animals and rode toward the horizon . Moments later , in the way that time often compressed in the Commons , they were out on the prairie and within sight of a cluster of wooden buildings that soon resolved into a rough and ready settlement . Riding into town , Bandar took a look through the idiomat 's eyes and judged that little of import to the Situation would happen here . The idiomats walking the wooden sidewalks or crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings were of the Essential/ Representational type , with far less detail than the dwelling where he had encountered Pa . Only the ones with signs that read " General Store , " " Sheriff , " and " Saloon " looked to be fully realized . The two idiomats pulled their mounts to a halt outside the first , where a man attired in clothes similar to the Hero 's , but with only a Sincere/Approximate level of detail , was asleep on a tilted-back wooden chair , his booted ankles crossed on a railing and a broad-brimmed hat over his eyes . A five-pointed metal star was pinned to his chest . " Mooney , where 's the sheriff ? " said the Principal . The man did not move , not even to raise his hat . " This time of day , I expect he 'll be over in the Nugget , " he said . The Hero and Helper turned their mounts and walked them over to the other Earnest/Realistic building . They both stepped down from the saddle then up onto the wooden porch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you wait outside . " " But Pa - " Bandar 's idiomat began , only to have his protest cut off . " I said wait . " The Hero lifted his weapon from its scabbard and went into the building , pushing through a pair of swinging half-doors made of slatted wood . The boy obeyed but positioned himself close to the entrance so that he could see and hear what went on within . Bandar gave the conversation between the Hero and the sheriff only a portion of his attention . This would be part of the process by which the Reluctant Hero is isolated from all hope of help and comes to know that , like it or not , he must solve his problem through his own efforts . There might be one or even two other potential supporters who would be appealed to in vain , then the Hero would resign himself to the necessity of a confrontation with the opposing Principal , Strayhom . Bandar sketched out in his mind the likely sequence of events , half listening as he heard the elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that anything outside the town limits was beyond his jurisdiction . Soon the Hero would come out of the saloon and get on with it . Probably he would ride out to Strayhorn 's center of power for the Confrontation Minor that , far from resolving the conflict , would instead intensify it . The Hero would be abused and something beyond him would be threatened-perhaps the boy or maybe a female Loved One who , if she was to play a role in the dynamic , ought to be factored into the Situation just about now . Bandar had the boy look around for a female idiomat . He was fairly sure that the tavern would not be the place to find her and so cast his eye back to the street outside . A high-pitched , oscillating whine impinged upon his concentration and caused him to look up . A circular shape had appeared in the air above the dusty street . Bandar 's initial impression of the object was colored by his having to perceive it through the idiomat boy 's sensorium , so he first took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flung into the air . Then , as the thing descended Bandar realized that it was not a small object at a low height , but was instead something immense that was plummeting swiftly toward the town from the upper reaches of the Location 's sky . That ca n't be light , the nonaut thought . As a Situation , Resisting the Despot could play itself out against a background in which the cruel Tyrant was the head of an invading species from another world , but in such a Location the tyranny would have been established before the Situation began its cycle . Besides , the Initiating Incident would be completely different from the theft of cattle that had sparked the dynamic in which Bandar and Fley were trapped . The object had by now come down to hover above the town , revealing itself to be a gigantic disc of dull gray metal . Around its rim a string of flashing lights chased themselves at high speed . As Bandar watched , four tapering and telescoping legs extended themselves from its ventral hub . One struck hard into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight down through the roofs of the **26;2770;TOOLONG buildings , with a crash of splintering wood and shattering glass . A rectangular hatch opened in the belly of what Bandar now recognized must be a fully realized assault ship from an entirely different Location , probably a variant of The Incursion of the Other , Class Two or Three . It 's a straddle , he thought . I 'm actually seeing a straddle . Straddles were Locations that , according to some theories , had come into existence far back in the development of the collective unconscious , when new variants on archetypical events and situations were still being created by a combination of human ingenuity and the unfolding of actual events in the waking world . Elements from two substantially different but superficially similar Locations would temporarily cohere in an Event or Situation that straddled both . But their internal dynamics would quickly pull them apart . As he pursued this line of introspection , a segmented ramp extruded from the oblong hatch . Even before it touched the ground the opening filled with armored and multi-limbed creatures that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But these invaders were clearly motivated to do more running than standing ; they swarmed down the ramp , each skittering on some of its limbs while others discharged energy weapons at any target they spotted with their stalked eyes . A yellow hound had been sleeping in the shade of a slab-sided wagon . Now it rose up and issued a tentative bark , then began a mournful howl - probably its only response to any stimulus , Bandar thought . A coruscating bolt of energy whuzzed through the air , catching the dog in mid ululation and causing the animal to glow brightly for a moment , then vanish , leaving a shadowy smudge on the ground . The invaders were firing indiscriminately . Bandar saw Mooney , the man who had been sleeping beneath a hat , stir himself . His booted heels hit the wooden sidewalk . He stood up shakily , but the hat still adhered to his brow , and Bandar surmised that the idiomat probably had no face beneath , none being needed for the minor role he was meant to play . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the metal-clad spiders scuttled down onto the street and opened fire . Another leaped from the ramp onto the second-story balcony of a building whose front bore the legend " Rosie 's Club for Gentlemen " and aimed its weapon down and across the street at a well-realized female idiomat , mature though still youthful and dressed in high-necked blouse and full skin topped by a gray gingham apron , who had just come out of the General Store . The Hero 's Loved One . I 'd wager , Bandar thought , a moment before the invader 's blast incinerated her . The boy in which he was housed had reacted much as Bandar had : he stared , open-mouthed , at a spectacle of violence all the more horrific for being completely unexpected . Now it struck home to the nonaut that the straddle must soon throw the idiomat into disharmony , putting his behavior well beyond Bandar 's influence . Along with that realization came a belated awareness that he was not viewing these events from a nonaut 's normal vantage-hidden from the invaders " view by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the frame of the action . And the next bolt of energy might be directed his way . As that thought came , the horse he had ridden in on lit up like a sunburst then dimmed to leave a smudged horse-shadow on the saloon porch . The Hero 's mount had just enough time to rear up in terror before it received the same illumination . Careful to keep his actions within his host 's range of acceptable reactions , Bandar now took control and pushed through the saloon 's swinging doors , ducking low as he did so . The Principal and the sheriff were still going through their dynamic , unaware that , out in the street , their Situation had been so convincingly straddled . Bandar crossed the sawdust-strewn floor to where the Hero stood frustrated above the sheriff , who shook his gray-haired head in shame and chagrin . Pa 's face hardened with anger as he swung toward Bandar and said , " I told you to stay outside , boy ! " I must be careful , Bandar told himself . This could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that spiders with incomprehensible weaponry were incinerating the town . Instead he willed the young idiomat to call out a danger that would fit within the Situation 's paradigm , then let the boy control his own vocal apparatus . " Apaches ! " the Helper cried . " They 're killing everyone ! " Screams and random shouts now came from outside , along with the repeated whuzz of energy weapons . The invaders were indeed killing everything that moved in the street , and would soon enter the buildings to continue their work . The sheriff now stood up and moved toward the noise , confusion clouding his face . A stocky man with pomaded hair and gaitered sleeves who had been polishing a glass behind a long wooden counter set it down and came out from behind the barrier to peer over the top of the doors . A moment later , the top quarter of him incandesced and evaporated , the rest of him tumbling to the floor . A second bolt entered through the door and cremated the sheriff . The Hero blinked , looked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to turn toward the portal . He worked a lever on the underside of his weapon , the clicking of the mechanism sounding a note of resolution . In a moment , Bandar knew , Pa would reluctantly advance to do what he could to resolve the situation , carrying Uncle Fley within him . The nonaut did not want to see his own relative go the way of the hat-faced man , but he knew that to move a Principal from his proper track he must offer a motive that was within the idiomat 's frame of reference . He took control of the boy to make him lay his hand on the Hero 's arm and say , " Pa , I 'm scared . " The Principal turned , as Bandar had expected , to deal with his Helper 's fear . The nonaut now followed up with a plausible suggestion . " They 're too many to fight . We ought a go warn the others , " he said . He did not know what others he referred to , but was confident that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have " others " to be concerned about . He did not think it wise to mention the fate of the Loved One . " You 're right , Mark , " the Hero said . " We 'll go out the back and circle around , see what we can do . " They went through a door behind the bar , finding a storeroom with barred windows and a door in its outer wall . The Principal crossed the intervening space and pulled open the door , then paused in the opening to peer outside . He took a half step back , then seemed to freeze . Bandar heard the clatter of many metal-shod feet from the saloon 's main room behind him , then the sound of the invaders " weapons . There was no time to delay . He shoved Pa out through the doorway and leapt after him . He saw immediately why the Principal had hesitated in the doorway : instead of an **26;2798;TOOLONG back alley , they were confined in a corridor formed by two parallel walls of well-dressed gray stone , Fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ceiling made , of tightly fitted slabs of the same material . The light was dim , provided only by flickering torches ensconced in the walls before and behind them at distant intervals . The chill that came from the floor of packed earth told Bandar they were beneath the Earth . Of the doorway through which they had entered , there was now no sign . This is definitely not right , he thought . He looked to the Principal and saw signs of tension and rising disorientation . Unless Pa could be focused , he would soon fall into disharmony . Bandar had no doubt that the long-barreled weapon was intrinsic to the idiomat 's motif of action . If the dislocated Hero snapped , the weapon would be put to use , and Bandar 's host was the only available target . He cast about for some means of consolidating the idiomat and saw a hopeful sign in the dirt . " Look , Pa , " he said , " our cattle must be up ahead . " The Principal looked where Bandar pointed . Clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led onward into the darkness . A pile of dung moldered nearby . There seemed to be only one set of prints , and something about their arrangement struck Bandar as odd , but he could not afford to stand around thinking about it . Idiomats were characterized by their actions ; to keep an armed Hero from devolving into wholesale violence , he needed to put the Principal to the work he was meant to do . " Come on , Pa , " the nonaut said , setting off in the direction the tracks led . The Hero paused only a moment before saying , " Wait up , boy . " He caught up with Bandar and , eyes flicking between the tracks and the dimness ahead , pushed past him to lead the way . Bandar was content to follow behind . It gave him time to think . They had entered an entirely different Location , and the nonaut had a strong hunch about what lay at the heart of all this darkness . It would be The Baiting of the Monster in Its Lair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judging by the primitive setting and the type of ogreish being that was indicated by the tracks and dung . But it ca n't be a straddle , Bandar reasoned . Scholars had argued that two Locations might temporarily cohere , but three was beyond all speculation . He wished he could deploy his globular map of the Commons . It would confirm his suspicions if he peered into the color-coded globe and found no flashing indicator to specify his location . But he could not display such an out-of-context object in the presence of the Hero or the Helper without pushing the idiomatic entities toward disharmony . I need no external confirmation , Bandar told himself . I came into this through a dream , and even if events are being manipulated by the Multifacet , there is only one venue where all of this can be happening - in my own head , my personal unconscious . It worried him , though , that the powers he should have commanded in a lucid dream were somehow being blocked . Then an even more worrisome thought intruded : the Commons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from , after all - but how could Uncle Fley have been transported into Bandar 's personal unconscious ? He did not believe his sensing of Fley 's presence in the Principal , however passive that presence might be , was an illusion ; an experienced noonaut was equipped to tell real from false . But these events meant that some of the most time-honored rules of how the Commons functioned could be radically overturned . For a moment Bandar imagined trying to make that case to the Grand Colloquium , then broke off the revery to concentrate on his immediate problem . The tunnel ended at a Y-junction . Bandar saw tracks leading in both directions , but those that went into the left-hand tunnel looked fresher . " This way , Pa , " he said . The Principal 's chiseled features still wore a look of underlying apprehension , but he nodded and said , " Stay close to me , Mark , " and followed the trail . Soon after the Y-junction they came to a wide circular chamber from which six other passageways led . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had his well-developed faculties focused on following the freshest trail , and he quickly chose an exit and led Bandar on . They moved at a brisk walk , the young idiomat 's shorter legs striving to keep pace , turning here to the left and there to the right , occasionally climbing or descending ramps of fitted stone slabs . They stopped at a T-intersection , the Hero 's nostrils flaring as he looked from one side to the other . " I can smell " em , " he said , gesturing with his prominent chin to the right . He eased back the hammer on the rifle until it gave a faint click and crept forward . Bandar was familiar with the motif of The Baiting of the Monster in Its Lair . The encounter of the Hero and the Monster represented the archetypical struggle for dominance between the conscious and unconscious elements of the psyche . Usually , the Hero was physically outclassed , but still managed to triumph over the stronger opponent through guile or preknowledge of some inherent weakness in the enemy . Pa could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his weapon , being out of place in this milieu , might affect the outcome . An odor similar to that which had wafted off the stolen cattle grew ranker as they made their way down the tunnel . Ahead was an archway limned in brighter torchlight than shone behind them , a chill breeze carrying the beast-smell to them . The Hero inched his way to the opening and eased down onto one knee before peering into the open space beyond . Bandar crept close behind and looked over the idiomat 's shoulder . We have returned to the original Location , was Bandar 's first thought . Beyond the tunnel lay a stretch of twilit prairie , short grass sweeping down a slope into a broad valley . Not far from the base of the slope sprawled a massive house made of squared , logs above a fieldstone foundation , with a porch shaded by a shingle roof running along its wide front . Bandar saw a barn and smithy , some low-built structures - " bunkhouses " - and a spacious corral in which stood Pa 's stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stay here , Mark , " he said . Bandar could not allow the Hero to carry Fley into whatever waited down there . The idiomat had seen only what he needed to see and had ignored the anomalies that surrounded the scene : that the sky 's darkness was too deep to be an effect of clouds or even night , that beyond the big house and to either side the prairie disappeared into thickening shadow , that no wind stirred the grass nor did even a Sincere/Approximate bird or beast ornament the view . They had not returned to Resisting the Despot . They were not in any true Location of the Commons , and there was no guarantee that the Situation would play itself out by the rules . Bandar urged the boy to defy his father . " No , Pa . You 'll need help with the cattle . " The Principal looked thoughtful for a moment then said , " All right , but you stay behind me . And if anything happens , you hit the ground . " He checked his weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set off down the slope . The air remained unnaturally still and the silence was immense . Not even the cattle stirred in their enclosure . The darkness that surrounded the visible elements of the scene seemed to move in as they neared the house and when Bandar looked back he saw blank nothingness crowding their heels . As they entered the wide dusty yard his eye caught motion in the shadows beneath the porch . From a wide-open door filled with a stygian blackness the three Henchmen emerged into the twilight , their hands resting on the butts of their holstered weapons . Their postures argued for their being in synch with the normal dynamics of the Situation , but when Bandar examined their expressions he did not see the mocking sneers that should have animated their features at this point in their cycle . A sharp tic drew up one corner of the Chief Henchman 's mouth , and the heavyeet one displayed a slack jaw and unfocused eyes , while the thin one with the mustache alternated between flashes of stark terror punctuated by an idiot grin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being intent on fulfilling his role in the conflict . When Heroes neared the cusp of a Situation 's essential action , they tended to drive forward with increasing momentum , encompassing outrageous violence and destruction as if they were the stuff of day-to-day life . " I 've come for my cattle , " Pa was telling the men on the porch . The Chief Henchman was shaking now , the tic wildly distorting his features , his bootheels beating a rapid staccato rhythm on the boards as his relatively simple faculties cracked under the strain of the anomalies . He 's supposed to defy the Hero , Bandar thought , but he 's becoming disharmonious . The other two should have backed up their chief , but without his lead they were falling even faster into disharmony : the chunky one toppled backward onto the porch 's wooden floor , shouting wordless sounds , his arms and legs kicking in convulsive spasms , while his mustached compadre turned weeping toward the stone wall , striking it over and over with his bony fists until flesh and blood flew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bandar sensed that this was the point , in the normal dynamic of the Location , when the Principal Antagonist would be summoned to the Final Confrontation . His supposition was confirmed when Pa stepped onto the porch and shouted into the black hole of the front door , " Strayhorn ! Come out here ! Or I 'm coming in ! " A cold wind , freighted with the rank stench that had hung in the air of the tunnels , gusted from the doorway . The Hero held his rifle at hip height , its muzzle aimed into the darkness . Bandar saw his square jaw twitch and his shoulders set themselves . " Wait ! " Bandar stepped onto the porch and took hold of the idiomat 's arm . " Do n't go in there . " " It 's all right , son , " said the Hero . " You wait here . " " No ! " Bandar held on . " Uncle Fley ! Do n't go in ! " The Hero 's stern face blinked . And then Fley was bemusedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , Guth " - now the voice was unmistakably Bandar 's uncle 's - " it 's only a dream . " " No , it 's .... " The nonaut broke off as a golden glow filled the doorway . A mist wafted toward him and from within it appeared the shifting form of the Multifacet . " You must not interfere with the essential dynamic , " said an applecheeked old woman . " He will be harmed . " " He is the Hero , you the Helper . He will do as he must , you as you must . " " No , we are real . Not like them . " Bandar indicated the Henchmen , who now stood or lay inert , all movement having ceased when the Multifacet appeared . " We do not recycle and begin anew . " " We see no difference , " said a dog with eyes as large as dinner plates . " You come , you go , only your stories endure . " " No , " Bandar said . " I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he may survive , " said a hulking creature made of animated stone . " If you do not , he surely will not . " " This is not fair . " A young man with checked trousers and red hair answered him with a shrug . " Nor is it according to the rules . " He was answered by a gentle-faced deity who wept crystal tears . " You must learn or die . Accept it . And now it comes . " The glow faded and with it the tear-stained face . Bandar saw that Fley had slipped back behind the Hero 's eyes and determination reclaimed its place in the Principal 's face . Pa turned again to the doorway . Bandar thought fast . " No , Pa , " he said . " He 'll jump you in the darkness . Make him come out . " The Principal checked himself . The Hero was always disposed to accept aid from the Helper . " You 're right , son , " he said . He stepped back , his weapon covering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A silence settled on them , but it was soon broken by a crashing of footsteps from within the house , the sound of hard , sharp hooves on a plank floor . The stench reached an overpowering intensity ; then the doorway filled with a creature too tall and too wide to fit easily through it : an amalgam of man and bull , spewing foam from its muzzle , shaking its needle-pointed horns , pawing with hoofed hind feet at the doorstep while its outsized hands reflexively grasped at the air . The thing roared , revealing teeth that were neither human nor bovine , but daggers meant to tear flesh . It ducked its head to clear the lintel , lowered one shoulder to squeeze through the doorway , then stepped clear onto the porch . The Hero fired his weapon without raising it from his hip , levering its action with speed and precision . A tight grouping of holes appeared in the center of the beast-headed thing 's leathery chest and the impact of the projectiles drove it back against the sides of the doorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wounds with black-nailed fingers , bared its pointed teeth , and roared again . Then it crossed the porch in two clattering strides and stepped down into the yard , its great hands reaching for Pa . " Run ! " Bandar shouted , but the Hero was now beyond his reach , locked into the Final Confrontation even though this version could not be anything like the Situation this Principal was intended for . As the beastman reached for him , the Hero dropped his weapon and leaped forward to seize its horns . He anchored his heels in the dust then rotated his body and pulled sideways and down as if to throw the roaring creature over his hip . But the impulses Pa could draw upon were out of synch with this struggle . The beast-man swept one brawny arm in an arc that caught the Hero across the midriff , folding him up and breaking his grip , lifting him from the ground and throwing him across the yard . He landed hard , the breath whooshing out of him . The brute watched as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attack , it swung its monstrous head toward Bandar . Its eyes were an expressionless black , unrimmed by white or iris , without intelligence or self-awareness , full only of a mindless intent to do harm . Bandar had seen the creature 's like before , though always while chanting a thran that kept him from being noticed . Now he felt the full impact of archetypical malevolence directed at his own being , and he gasped as if struck by a blast of icy water . From the corner of his eye he saw the Hero trying to rise and return to the fight . That was , after all , what Heroes did , however unequal the combat . And help is what the Helper does , he thought , though how can I help against this ? The bull-man pawed the dust , its baleful glare still locked on the nonaut . Then the intensity of its gaze diminished and , for a moment , another persona inspected Bandar through its black orbs , with a gaze full of cruel and disdainful amusement . Gabbris ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Didrick Gabbris was unmistakable . But it can not be ! The thought flashed through Bandar 's mind . Dreamers could meet while passing through the outer arrondissement of the Commons , though it took exceptional powers of nonaut technique for them to do so . But actual dreams took place in an individual 's own unconscious , and no other person could share that psychic space . The barriers were impermeable . And yet .... Here was Uncle Fley inserted into a dream of Bandar 's , and now Didrick Gabbris had undoubtedly appeared-not a dream-imagining by Bandar , but the actual entity that was his enemy 's own psyche . Which was impossible . Which violated all of the rules discovered and delineated over the millennia by countless explorers of the Commons , so many of whom had given their lives as the price of hard-won knowledge . And now , as the monster turned its gaze back toward the Hero who had risen to one knee , a hand to his diaphragm as he struggled to control his disrupted breathing , Bandar knew what this mad business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said . He was being taught an unprecedented lesson , but the learning was being delivered in the indirect manner by which the nosphere always transmitted its wisdom . " I understand , " he said aloud . " You are showing me that rules I have always been taught are sacrosanct now no longer apply . Very well , I accept the lesson . I will be the Helper , and willingly . But now you must help me . " He saw no golden glow , no swirling mist or protean figure , but he knew he had been heard . Now he would see if his terms had been accepted . He focused upon the setting . I dream a lucid dream , he thought , putting behind the assertion all the strength of will available to a mature nonaut . The dream is mine . All here is mine . I take control . The beast-man 's hind legs , human from hip through thigh , bovine from knee to hoof , quivered as it crouched and set itself to leap upon the Hero . Bandar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appendage into a cutting blade , then swept his arm down in a chopping gesture . As the edge of his hand clove the air , the ground beneath it trembled , then split open . A crack raced zigzag across the yard , dividing the monster from Bandar and the Hero . Now the nonaut flung wide his arms and the Earth groaned and snapped as the crevice gaped and deepened . The beast-man roared its rage , its hooves stamping the ground . It gnashed murderous teeth and glared at Bandar with a primal hatred in which he could still see the spiteful malice of Didrick Gabbris . Then it raced forward and flung itself headlong across the still widening gap . For a long moment it seemed to float motionless in the air , then its chest crashed into the lip of the ruptured ground , and its huge hands clawed at the dust while its dangling hoofed feet scratched and scrabbled for purchase . Bandar watched with satisfaction . It will not succeed , he thought . The thing was losing its struggle and would slip inevitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathomless depths of its eyes that still contained Gabbris . " We have beaten you , " Bandar told him . Then he saw its eyes look beyond him , saw triumph flare in their blackness . Bandar turned , a shout of " No ! " forming in his mouth . But he was too late . The Principal moved past him on shaky but determined legs and raised a foot to plant one boot heel square between the horns of the enemy . The great head snapped back and the creature lost all hope of climbing out of the riven earth . But as it slid backward into the abyss it reached and seized . Its giant fingers encircled Pa 's calf and pulled him over the edge . Bandar flung himself down , his head and shoulders over the lip of the precipice . Below him he could see the two of them falling slowly into the bottomless darkness , the monster 's grip unyielding on the Hero . There was no time to control the event . Pa looked up and Bandar could see his uncle staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . " Fley ! " the nonaut shouted . " Wake up , Fley ! It 's only a dream ! Wake up ! " And then they were gone . This time , the Multifacet left Guth Bandar with a full memory of his experiences . Thus it was with both urgency and trepidation that , the following morning , the young man climbed the angled stairway that led to the apartment above the housewares store . He passed through the silent lounge and entered the hallway that led to the master sleeping chamber . No sound came from behind the closed door . He engaged the device that caused the panel to open and poked his head around the jamb . His uncle lay facedown on the sleeping pallet . Bandar listened but heard no breathing . He wished he could go back downstairs and avoid this moment , but instead he summoned up his nonautic discipline and crossed the room . He put his hand on Fley 's shoulder and gently shook . A sharp intake of breath told Bandar that the man still lived . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he feared . " Uncle , " he said , " time to awaken . " The older man made incoherent sounds , and Bandar 's heart fell within him . " Uncle , " he said again and pulled at the thin shoulder to roll the man over . Fley came easily and a moment later was sprawled on his back , mouth slack and eyes staring without focus . Oh , no , Bandar said within the confines of his skull . He has not come back .

" I believe they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You may be right , " said Bandar . " In any case , when the new owners take charge , they will have no need of me .
