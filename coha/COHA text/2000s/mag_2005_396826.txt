Despite denials by government officials , slavery remains a way of life in the African nation of Niger <p> LIGHTNING AND THUNDER split the Saharan night . In northern Niger , heavy rain and wind smashed into the commodious goatskin tent of a Tuareg tribesman named Tafan and his family , snapping a tent pole and tumbling the tent to the ground . <p> Huddling in a small , tattered tent nearby was a second family , a man , a woman and their four children . Tafan ordered the woman , Asibit , to go outside and stand in the full face of the storm while holding the pole steady , keeping his tent upright until the rain and wind ceased . <p> Asibit obeyed because , like tens of thousands of other Nigeriens , she was born into a slave caste that goes back hundreds of years . As she tells it , Tafan 's family treated her not as a human , but as chattel , a beast of burden like their goats , sheep and camels . Her eldest daughter , Asibit says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child turned 6 , he gave her as a present to his brother  --  a common practice among Niger 's slave owners . Asibit , fearful of a whipping , watched in silence as her daughter was taken away . <p> " From childhood , I toiled from early morning until late at night , " she recalls matter-of-factly . She pounded millet , prepared breakfast for Tafan and his family and ate the leftovers with her own . While her husband and children herded Tafan 's livestock , she did his household chores and milked his camels . She had to move his tent , open-fronted to catch any breeze , four times a day so his family would always be in shade . Now 51 , she seems to bear an extra two decades in her lined and leathery face . " I never received a single coin during the 50 years , " she says . <p> Asibit bore these indignities without complaint . On that storm-tossed night in the desert , she says , she struggled for hours to keep the tent upright , knowing she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tent pole , something inside her snapped : she threw the pole aside and ran into the night , making a dash for freedom to the nearest town , 20 miles across the desert . <p> HISTORY RESONATES WITH countless verified accounts of human bondage , but Asibit escaped only in June of last year . <p> Disturbing as it may seem in the 21st century , there may be more forced labor in the world now than ever . About 12.3 million people toil in the global economy on every continent save Antarctica , according to the United Nations ' International Labour Organization , held in various forms of captivity , including those under the rubric of human trafficking . The U.S. State Department 's annual report on trafficking in persons , released in June , spotlighted 150 countries where more than a hundred people were trafficked in the past year . Bonded laborers are entrapped by low wages in never-ending debt ; illegal immigrants are coerced by criminal syndicates to pay off their clandestine passage with work at subminimum wages ; girls are kidnapped for prostitution , boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes that " Niger is a source , transit , and destination country for men , women and children trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation and forced domestic and commercial labor . " But there is also something else going on in Niger  --  and in Chad , Mali and Mauritania . Across western Africa , hundreds of thousands of people are being held in what is known as " chattel slavery , " which Americans may associate only with the transatlantic slave trade and the Old South . <p> In parts of rural West Africa dominated by traditional tribal chieftains , human beings are born into slavery , and they live every minute of their lives at the whim of their owners . They toil day and night without pay . Many are whipped or beaten when disobedient or slow , or for whatever reasons their masters concoct . Couples are separated when one partner is sold or given away ; infants and children are passed from one owner to another as gifts or dowry ; girls as young as 10 are sometimes raped by their owners or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families of such slaves have been held for generations , and their captivity is immutable : the one thing they can be sure of passing on to their children is their enslavement . <p> One of the earliest records of enslaved Africans goes back to the seventh century , but the practice existed long before . It sprang largely from warfare , with victors forcing the vanquished into bondage . ( Many current slave owners in Niger are Tuareg , the legendary warlords of the Sahara . ) The winners kept slaves to serve their own households and sold off the others . In Niger , slave markets traded humans for centuries , with countless thousands bound and marched to ports north or south , for sale to Europe and Arabia or America . <p> As they began exercising influence over Niger in the late 19th century , the French promised to end slavery there  --  the practice had been abolished under French law since 1848-but they found it difficult to eradicate a social system that had endured for so long , especially given the reluctance of the country 's chieftains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still thriving at the turn of the century , and the chances of abolition all but disappeared during World War I , when France pressed its colonies to join the battle . " In order to fulfill their quotas each administrator in Niger relied on traditional chiefs who preferred to supply slaves to serve as cannon fodder , " writes Nigerien social scientist Galy Kadir Abdelkader . <p> During the war , when rebellions broke out against the French in Niger , the chieftains once again came to the rescue ; in return , French administrators turned a blind eye to slavery Following independence in 1960 , successive Nigerien governments have kept their silence . In 2003 , a law banning and punishing slavery was passed , but it has not been widely enforced . <p> Organizations outside Niger , most persistently the London-based Anti-Slavery International , are still pushing to end slavery there . The country 's constitution recognizes the United Nations ' Universal Declaration of Human Rights ( Article 4 : " No one shall be held in slavery or servitude ; slavery and the slave trade shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.N . has done little to ensure Niger 's compliance . Neither has France , which still has immense influence in the country because of its large aid program and cultural ties . <p> And neither has the United States . While releasing this year 's trafficking report , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice reminded Americans of President Bush 's plea in a 2004 speech for an end to human trafficking , but the U.S. Embassy in Niger professes little on-the-ground knowledge of chattel slavery there . In Washington , Ambassador John Miller , a senior adviser to Rice who heads the State Department 's Trafficking in Persons section , says , " We 're just becoming aware of transgenerational slavery in Niger . " <p> The Nigerien government , for its part , does not acknowledge the problem : it has consistently said that there are no slaves in Niger . Troubled by the government 's denials , a group of young civil servants in 1991 set up the Timidria Association , which has become the most prominent nongovernmental organization fighting slavery in Niger . Timidria ( " fraternity-solidarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up 682 branches across the country to monitor slavery , help protect escaped slaves and guide them in their new , free lives . <p> The group faces a constant battle . Last March , Timidria persuaded a Tuareg chief to free his tribe 's 7,000 slaves in a public ceremony The mass manumission was widely publicized prior to the planned release , but just days before it was to happen , the government prevailed upon the chief to abandon his plan . <p> " The government was caught in a quandary , " a European ambassador to Niger told me . " How could it allow the release when it claimed there were no slaves in Niger ? " <p> THE FLIGHT FROM PARIS to Niamey , Niger 's capital city , takes five hours , much of it above the dun-hued sweep of the Sahara in northern Africa . We land in a sandstorm , and when the jet 's door opens , the 115-degree heat hits like a furnace 's fiery blast . Niamey is a sprawl of mud huts , ragtag markets and sandy streets marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named after Martin Luther King Jr. , but the signpost has been knocked askew and left unrepaired . <p> Nigeriens walk with the graceful lope of desert dwellers . The city reflects the country , a jumble of tribes . Tall , slim Tuareg men conceal all but their hands , feet and dark eyes in a swath of cotton robes and veils ; some flaunt swords buckled to their waists . Tribesmen called Fulanis clad in conical hats and long robes herd donkeys through the streets . The majority Hausa , stocky and broad-faced , resemble their tribal cousins in neighboring Nigeria . <p> Apart from the rare Mercedes Benz , there is hardly any sign of wealth . Niger is three times bigger than California , but two-thirds of it is desert , and its standard of living ranks 176th on the United Nations ' human development index of 177 countries , just ahead of Sierra Leone . About 60 percent of its 12 million people live on less than $1 a day , and most of the others not much more . It 's a landlocked country with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Intelligence reports that Saddam Hussein tried to buy yellowcake uranium from Niger have proved " highly dubious , " according to the State Department . ) A 2004 U.S. State Department report on Niger noted that it suffers from " drought , locust infestation , deforestation , soil degradation , high population growth rates 3.3% , and exceedingly low literacy rates . " In recent months , 2.5 million of Niger 's people have been on the verge of famine . <p> A Nigerian is lucky to reach the age of 50 . The child mortality rate is the world 's second worst , with a quarter of all children dying under the age of 5 . " Niger is so poor that many people perish daily of starvation , " Jeremy Lester , the European Union 's head of delegation in Niamey , tells me . <p> And Niger 's slaves are the poorest of the poor , excluded totally from the meager cash economy . <p> Clad in a flowing robe , Soli Abdourahmane , a former minister of justice and state prosecutor , greets me in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many slaves in Niger , and the same families have often been held captive by their owners ' families for centuries , " he tells me , speaking French , the country 's official language , though Hausa is spoken more widely " The slave masters are mostly from the nomadic tribes  --  the Tuareg , Fulani , Toubou and Arabs . " <p> A wry grin spreads across his handsome face . " The government claims there are no slaves in Niger , and yet two years ago it legislated to outlaw slavery , with penalties from 10 to 30 years . It 's a contradiction , no ? " <p> Moussa Zangaou , a 41-year-old member of Parliament , says he opposes slavery He belongs to a party whose leaders say it does not exist in Niger , but he says he is working behind the scenes toward abolition . " There are more than 100,000 slaves in Niger , and they suffer terribly with no say in their destiny , " he tells me . " Their masters treat them like livestock , they do n't believe they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why does the government deny there is slavery in Niger , and yet , in the shadows , allow it to continue ? " It 's woven into our traditional culture , " Zangaou explains , " and many tribal chieftains , who still wield great power , are slave owners and bring significant voting blocs of their people to the government at election time . " <p> Also , the government fears international condemnation . Eighty percent of the country 's capital budget comes from overseas donors , mostly European countries . " The president is currently the head of the Economic Community of West African States , " Zangaou adds , " and he fears being embarrassed by slavery still existing in Niger . " <p> In the meantime , slaves are risking terrible beatings or whippings to escape and hide in far-off towns  --  especially in Niamey , with a population of 774,000 , where they can disappear . <p> One afternoon , a Timidria worker takes me to Niamey 's outskirts to meet a woman he says is a runaway slave . With us is the BBC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as my interpreter and sounding board . <p> We enter a maze of mud huts whose walls form twisting channels that lead deep into a settlement that would not appear out of place in the Bible . It houses several thousand people . As camels loaded with straw amble by , children stare wide-eyed at me while their parents , sprawled in the shade , throw me hard glances . Many have fled here from rural areas , and strangers can mean trouble in a place like this . <p> A woman comes out from a mud house , carrying a baby and with a 4-year-old girl trailing behind . Her name is Timizgida . She says she is about 30 , looks 40 , and has a smile that seems as fresh as her recent good fortune . She says she was born to slaves owned by fair-skinned Tuaregs out in the countryside hut never knew her parents , never even knew their names ; she was given as a baby to her owner , a civil servant . She was allowed to play with his children until she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of captivity . <p> Her fate from then on was much the same as Asibit 's ; she rose before dawn to fetch water from a distant well for her owner 's thirsty herds and his family , and then toiled all day and late into the night , cooking , doing chores and eating scraps . " I was only allowed to rest for two or three days each year , during religious festivals , and was never paid , " she tells me . " My master did n't pay his donkeys , and so he thought why should he pay me and his other slaves ? " <p> The spark in Timizgida 's eye signals a rebellious nature , and she says her owner and his family beat her many times with sticks and whips , sometimes so hard that the pain lingered for months . After one such beating three years ago , she decided to run away . She says a soldier took pity on her and paid her and her children 's bus fares to Niamey . " With freedom , I became a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's the sweetest of feelings . " <p> Her smile grows wider as she points to her kids . " My children were also my master 's slaves , but now they 're free . " <p> Timizgida 's account echoes those I will hear from other slaves in far-off regions in a country where communications among the poor are almost nonexistent . But the president of Niger 's Human Rights Commission , Lompo Garba , tells me that Timizgida  --  and all other Nigeriens who claim they were or are slaves  --  is lying . <p> " Niger has no slaves , " Lompo says , leaning across his desk and glaring . " Have you seen anyone in Niger blindfolded and tied up ? " <p> Niger 's prime minister , Hama Amadou , is equally insistent when we meet at his Niamey office , not far from the U.S. Embassy . He is Fulani and has a prominent tribal scar , an X , carved into his right cheek . " Niger has no slaves , " he tells me emphatically . <p> And yet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister of internal affairs stating that slavery existed in Niger and was immoral , and listing 32 places around the country where slaves could be found . When I tell him I know about the letter  --  I even have a copy of it  --  the prime minister at first looks astonished and then steadies himself and confirms that he wrote it . <p> But still he denies that his country has slaves . " Try and find slaves in Niger , " he says . " You wo n't find even one . " <p> AS I LEAVE FOR NIGER 'S INTERIOR to take up the prime minister 's challenge , I am accompanied by Moustapha Kadi Oumani , the firstborn son of a powerful Tuareg chieftain and known among Nigeriens as the Prince of Illla , the capital of his father 's domain . Elegant , sharp-minded and with the graceful command that comes from generations of unchallenged authority , he guides us by SUV to Azarori , about 300 miles northeast of Niamey and one of more than 100 villages under his father 's feudal command . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with slaves to wait on him hand and foot , but his exposure to their condition , and a few years studying in Italy and Switzerland , convinced him that no person should belong to another . Moustapha now works in the Department of Civil Aviation in Niamey , but he devotes much of his spare time working to end slavery in Niger and improve the living conditions of ordinary Nigeriens . In December 2003 , he freed all ten of the slaves he had inherited in a public ceremony at Tahoua , about 110 miles from Azarori . On the government 's orders , police seized the audio- and videotapes of reporters and cameramen who were covering the event . " They did n't want people to know , " says Idy , who was there for the BBC . <p> The number of slaves in Niger is unknown . Moustapha scoffs at a widely quoted Timidria survey in 2002 that put it at 870,363 . " There was double counting , and the surveys definition of a slave was loose , " he says . Anti-Slavery International , using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that figure has also been questioned  --  as both too high and too low . <p> The countryside , facing a famine , looks sickly , and when the SUV pulls to the side of the road for a comfort stop , a blur of locusts clatter into the air from a stunted tree nearby . We arrive at Azarori ( pop . 9,000 ) at midmorning as several men and children  --  all slaves , Moustapha says  --  herd goats to pasture . <p> A stooped old man in a conical hat and purple robe tells me that he has worked hard for his owner for no pay since he was a child . Another man , Ahmed , who is 49 , says that Allah ordained that he and his family are to be slaves through the generations . ( Niger is 95 percent Muslim . ) When I ask him to quote that command from the Koran , he shrugs . " I ca n't read or write , and so my master , Boudal , told me , " he says . <p> Like most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and healthy . " A slave master feeds his donkeys and camels well so they can work hard , and it 's the same with his slaves , " Moustapha says . <p> This may explain the extraordinary devotion many slaves insist they offer their masters in this impoverished nation , especially if they are not mistreated . I ask Ahmed how he would feel if his owner gave away his daughter . " If my master asked me to throw my daughter down the well , I 'd do it immediately , " he replies . <p> Truly ? <p> " Truly , " he replies . <p> Moustapha shakes his head as we sip the highly sugared bitter tea favored by the Tuareg . " Ahmed has the fatalistic mindset of many slaves , " he says . " They accept it 's their destiny to be a bellah , the slave caste , and obey their masters without question . " <p> We journey to another village along dirt roads , framed by a sandy landscape with few trees but many mud villages . At one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moustapha 's feet by her own choice and tells how she was given to her owner as an infant . Her great-grandson , who looks to be about 6 years old , sits by her side . Like many other child slaves I see , he is naked , while the village 's free children wear bright robes and even jeans . The naked children I see stay close to their relatives , their eyes wary and their step cautious , while the clothed children stroll about or play chase . <p> The village chief , wearing a gold robe and gripping a string of prayer beads , asks Moustapha , as the son of his feudal lord , for advice . A man had recently purchased a " fifth wife " from a slave owner in the village , the chief says , but returned her after discovering she was two months pregnant . He wanted a new slave girl or his money back . Although Islam limits a man to four wives , a slave girl taken as a concubine is known as a " fifth wife " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can afford . <p> Moustapha 's face tightens in barely concealed anger . " Tell him he 'll get neither , and if he causes trouble , let me know . " <p> In late afternoon , we reach the outskirts of Illla and enter wide , sandy streets lined with mud-house compounds . About 12,000 people live here , ruled by Moustapha 's father , Kadi Oumani , a hereditary tribal chieftain with more than a quarter of a million people offering fealty to him . " My ancestor Agaba conquered Illla in 1678 and enslaved the families of warriors who opposed him , " Moustapha tells me . " Many of their descendants are still slaves . " <p> Moustapha has surveyed the families of the 220 traditional chieftains in Niger , known as royal families , and found that they collectively own more than 8,500 slaves whose status has not changed since their ancestors were conquered . " When a princess marries , she brings slaves as part of her dowry , " he tells me . He has caused trouble for his highborn family by opposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What worries me is that there are still slaves in Niger . " <p> Moustapha 's father sits on a chair in a mud-wall compound with a dozen chiefs perched cross-legged on the ground around him . Two dozen longhorn cattle , sheep and goats mill about , there for the Tuareg aristocrats to enjoy as a reminder of their nomadic origins . Kadi Oumani is 74 years old and wears a heavy robe and an open veil that reveals his dark , bluff face . Moustapha greets him with a smile and then leads me to the compound set aside for us during our visit . <p> For the next hour Moustapha sits serenely on a chair at the compound 's far end , greeting clan leaders who have come to pay their respects . A special visitor is Abdou Nayoussa , one of the ten slaves Moustapha freed 20 months ago . Abdou 's broad face marks him as a member of the local tribe conquered by Moustapha 's ancestor . <p> " As a boy I was chosen to look after the chieftain 's horses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " I worked hard every day for no pay , was beaten many times and could never leave Illla because I belonged to Moustapha 's family . " His eyes-which never once meet Moustapha 's  --  are dim with what I take to be pain . " At night I cried myself to sleep , thinking about my fate and especially the fate of the children I 'd have one day : " <p> Ahdou still works as the chieftain 's horse handler , for which he is given little pay , but he is now free to do what he wants . " The difference is like that between heaven and hell , " he tells me . " When I get enough money , I 'm going to Niamey and never coming back . " <p> As the sky darkens , we eat grilled lamb and millet . Nearby a courtier sings an ancient desert tune . Moustapha 's cousin Oumarou Marafa , a burly , middle-aged secondary school teacher , joins us . " He 's a slave owner and not ashamed of it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I desired one of my mother 's slaves , a beautiful 12-year-old girl , and she gave her to me as a fifth wife , " Oumarou tells me . " There was no marriage ceremony ; she was mine to do with her as I wished . " <p> Did that include sex ? " Of course , " he says . After a few years , he sent the girl away , and she married another man . But Oumarou still considers her his possession . " When I want to sleep with her , she must come to my bed , " he says without a hint of emotion . <p> I find this hard to believe , but Moustapha says it is true . " It 's the custom , and her husband is too scared to object , " he adds . <p> " There are many men in Illla with fifth wives , " Oumarou goes on , even though the cost is about a thousand U.S. dollars , or three years ' pay for a laborer . " If you want a fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow to slave owners with girls for sale here in Illla . " <p> I squirm at the thought . Late into the night Moustapha and I attempt to convince his cousin of slavery 's evil nature , trying to change his belief that slaves are a separate , lower species . " Try and understand the enormous mental pain of a slave seeing his child given away as a present to another family , " I tell him . <p> " You Westerners , " he replies . " You only understand your way of life , and you think the rest of the world should follow you . " <p> Next morning , Moustapha takes me to the 300-year-old mud-brick palace where his father , in a daily ritual , is meeting chiefs who have come to honor him . Inside , Kadi Oumani sits on a modest throne from which he daily delivers judgments on minor disputes , principally about land and marriages . <p> " There are no slaves in Niger , " he tells me . <p> " But I 've met slaves . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chieftain 's monotone . " They are one of the traditional Tuareg castes . We have nobles , the ordinary people and the bellah . " <p> JUST BEFORE DAWN the morning after , I set out with Idy , my translator , to drive north more than 125 miles deeper into the desert near Tamaya , the home of Asibit , the woman who says she escaped from her master during the storm . <p> There , we pick up Foungoutan Oumar , a young Tuareg member of Timidria , who will guide us across 20 miles of open desert to wells where he says slaves water their masters ' herds in the morning and late afternoon . Foungoutan wants to avoid meeting slave owners , especially Asibit 's former master , Tafan , who he says recently used his sword to lop off the hand of a man in a dispute . But it 's not necessarily Tafan 's anger we wish to sidestep . " If we go to the tents of the slave masters , they 'll know we 've come to talk to their slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The sand stretches to the horizon , and the sun already burns our skin even though it 's just eight o'clock in the morning . There is no one at the first two wells we visit . " The slaves have already gone with the herds , " Foungoutan says with a shrug . The third well , nudged by a cluster of trees , is owned by a man named Halilou , Tafan 's brother . <p> Six children are unloading water containers from donkeys . The younger children are naked . When they see us , they scream and bury their heads in the donkey 's flanks and necks . Shivering in apparent fear , they refuse to lift their heads or talk . Three women arrive balancing water containers on their heads , having walked the three miles from Halilou 's tents . They turn their faces away from us . <p> Soon a middle-aged man appears with a naked child by his side . His face clouds when he sees us . " My master said he 'll beat me if I talk to strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell their master about us . <p> With some coaxing he says their master 's name is Halilou and adds that they are all slaves in his camp . He says he has toiled for Halilou 's family since he was a child and has never received any money . Halilou has beaten him many times , but the man shrugs off more talk of punishment and refuses to give his name . <p> Another man arrives , and the two of them begin drawing water from the well , helped by five donkeys hauling on a rope attached to a canvas bucket . They pour the water into troughs for the thirsty cows , sheep and goats and then fill the containers . As the women lead the water-laden donkeys back to their master 's tents , the two men and children herd the livestock out into the desert to graze on the shriveled grass and plants that grow there . <p> At Tamaya , a small village hemmed in by desert , we find Asibit at her usual spot in the bustling marketplace where robed Tuareg , Fulani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swords . " Many of these men own slaves , " Foungoutan says . " I 've reported them to the police , but they take no action against them . " <p> When Asibit reached Tamaya on the morning after the thunderstorm , she was led to Foungoutan , who took her to the police . She made a formal complaint that Tafan was a slave owner , and the police responded by rescuing her children , including the daughter presented to Halilou . But Asibit says they left her husband with Tafan . <p> Asibit squats in the shade , making a drink from millet and selling it for the equivalent of 10 cents . She smiles easily now . " You ca n't understand what freedom is until you 've been a slave , " she says . " Now , I can go to sleep when I want and get up any time I want . No one can beat me or call me bad names every day My children and grandchildren are free . " <p> FREEDOM , HOWEVER , is relative . For former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is harsh . " Former slaves suffer extreme discrimination in getting a job , government services , or finding marriage partners for their children , " says Romana Cacchioli , the Africa expert for Anti-Slavery International , speaking by telephone from the group 's London headquarters . <p> The government is not likely to come forward to help ex-slaves on its own ; to acknowledge ex-slaves would be to acknowledge slavery And the government , lacking the power to confront the chieftains and fearing condemnation from the outside world , gives no signs of doing that . <p> Within Niger , Timidria remains the most visible force for change , but it , too , faces a long road : many Nigeriens say they do not support the antislavery cause because they believe the group 's president , Ilguilas Weila , has profited from his association with Western aid organizations .
