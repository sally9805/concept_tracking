The solid thud of David 's car door shutting echoed off the stone face of the eight-story building we had parked beside . Leaning against the gray sports car , I shaded my eyes and squinted up at its aged and architecturally beautiful columns and fluted sills . The uppermost floor was golden in the setting sun , but here at street level we were in a chill shadow . Cincinnati had a handful of such landmark buildings , most abandoned , as this one appeared to be . " Are you sure this is the place ? " I asked , then dragged the flat of my arms off the roof of his car . The river was close ; I could smell the oil and gas mix of boats . The top floor probably had a view . Though the streets were clean , the area was clearly depressed . But with a little attention  --  and a lot of money  --  I could see it as one of the city 's newest residential hot spots . David set his worn leather briefcase down and reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a sheaf of papers , he flipped to the back , then glanced at the distant corner and the street sign . " Yes , " he said , his soft voice tense but not worried . Tugging my little red leather jacket down , I hiked my bag higher on my shoulder and headed to his side of the car , heels clunking . I 'd like to say I was wearingmy butt-kicking boots in deference to this being a run , but in reality I just liked them . They went well with the blue jeans and black T-shirt I had on ; and with the matching cap , I looked and felt sassy . David frowned at the chunking  --  or my choice of attire , maybe  --  steeling his features to bland acceptance when he saw me quietly laughing at him . He was in his respectable work clothes , somehow pulling off the mix of the three-piece suit and his shoulder-length , wavy black hair held back in a subdued clip . I 'd seen him a couple of times in running tights that showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a full-length duster and cowboy hat  --  Van Helsing , eat your heart out  --  but his somewhat small stature lost none of its presence when he dressed like the insurance claims adjuster he was . David was kind of complex for a Were . I hesitated when I came even with him , and together we eyed the building . Three streets over I could hear the shush of traffic , but here , nothing moved . " It 's really quiet , " I said , holding my elbows against the chill of the mid-May evening . Brown eyes pinched , David ran a hand over his clean-shaven cheeks . " It 's the right address , Rachel , " he said , peering at the top floor . " I can call to check if you want . " " No , this is cool . " I smiled with my lips closed , hefting my shoulder bag and feeling the extra weight of my splat gun . This was David 's run , not mine , and about as benign as you could get  --  adjusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would n't need the sleepy-time charms I loaded my modified paint ball gun with , but I just grabbed my bag when David asked me to come with him . It was still packed from my last run  --  storming the back room of an illegal spammer . God , plugging him had been satisfying . David pushed into motion , gallantly gesturing me to go first . He was older than I by about ten years , but it was hard to tell unless you looked at his eyes . " She 's probably living in one of those new flats they 're making above old warehouses , " he said , heading for the ornate stoop . I snickered , and David looked at me . " What ? " he said , dark eyebrows rising . I entered the building before him , shoving the door so he could follow tight on my heels . " I was thinking if you lived in one , it would still be a warehouse . Were house ? Get it ? " He sighed , and I frowned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guilt hit me , and my pace faltered . Jenks was currently AWOL , hiding out in some Were 's basement after I 'd majorly screwed up by not trusting him , but with spring here , I could step up my efforts to apologize and get him to return . The front lobby was spacious , full of gray marble and little else . My heels sounded loud in the tall-ceilinged space . Creeped out , I stopped chunking and started walking to minimize the noise . A pair of black-edged elevators were across the lobby , and we headed for them . David pushed the up button and rocked back . I eyed him , the corners of my lips quirking . Though he was trying to hide it , I could see he was getting excited about his run . Being a field insurance adjustor was n't the desk job one might think it was . Most of his company 's clients were Inderlanders  --  witches , Weres , and the occasional vampire  --  and as such , getting the truth as to why a client 's car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the teenage son backing it into the garage wall , or did the witch down the street finally get tired of hearing him beep every time he left the drive ? One was covered , the other was n't , and sometimes it took , ah , creative interviewing techniques to get the truth . David noticed I was smiling at him , and the rims of his ears went red under his dark complexion . " I appreciate you coming with me , " he said , shifting forward as the elevator dinged and the doors opened . " I owe you dinner , okay ? " " No problem . " I joined him in the murky , mirrored lift , and watched my reflection in the amber light as the doors closed . I 'd had to move an interview for a possible client , but David had helped me in the past , and that was far more important . The trim Were winced .
