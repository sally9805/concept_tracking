Yamila Sigler is wondering whether she enrolled in a Berlitz course instead of a sailing class . All morning on Miami 's Biscayne Bay , in a 23-ft. keelboat called the Woolly Bully , instructor Dean Sealey has been drilling her and three other students on tacks ( zigzag turns ) , nuns ( channel-marking buoys ) and cunninghams ( sail-tightening lines ) . " English is not my first language , " frets Sigler , 33 , a civil engineer who came to the U.S. from Cuba a decade ago . And sailing jargon is certainly nothing she ever expected to learn . As the Woolly Bully heads home , Sealey tells Sigler to do the docking  --  which will of course require her to luff the jib ( loosen the front sail ) . " They told me this would be relaxing , " says Sigler . " I 'm not relaxing . " <P> But when Sigler docks the boat successfully , her mood swells like a mainsail . She can do this , she realizes  --  and within a few weeks , she and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking lessons at Miami 's Castle Harbor Sailing School this summer , will be certified to sail solo in a basic keelboat . " We do n't drink , smoke or party a lot , " says Sigler , " so when we go on vacation or a business trip to a place like the Bahamas , we want to sail . " <P> The urge to be your own skipper is spreading . Since the mid- ' 90s , the number of students in U.S. sailing schools has more than doubled , to almost 150,000 . The number of schools accredited by the largest certification organization , the American Sailing Association ( ASA ) , based in California , has grown 40% , to more than 200 . Keelboat-certification enrollment at schools affiliated with its smaller rival , U.S. Sailing , based in Rhode Island , has leaped 200% , to 6,000 students . That boom has turned the mom-and-pop sailing-instruction business into an industry that takes in more than $30 million a year . It 's also creating a smart new way of sailing without all the hassles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolution of expectations on the public 's part , " says asa executive vice president Harry Munns . " Interest in sailing has grown far beyond what boat sales used to reflect . " <P> A sailboat , it has often been said , is a hole in the water into which one pours money . Weekend sailors joke that boat is an acronym for Bring Out Another Thousand . A used 18-ft. sloop can cost $10,000 , while a new 36-ft. two-masted ketch can run $100,000 and up . And then there 's the maintenance and the commitment to sail from a single port . Sailing courses , however , free their students from these costs and limitations . That 's because U.S. certifications are accepted in most ports around the country and the world . Graduates can use their certification to rent a craft , usually for less than $50 an hour or $250 a day . <P> The rental option is especially popular with sailors who love to travel and try the waters in different locations . With a sailing certification , you can live in Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craft and scene for the weekend up the coast in San Francisco , or take a weeklong vacation cruise in the Adriatic , with a boat rented out of Venice . " People make more money today , but they 've got less leisure time , " says Cai Svendsen , owner of Castle Harbor . " So it 's not that they ca n't afford to own a boat ; many are just too smart to own one . "
