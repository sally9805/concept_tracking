The collection of Victorian works of art and furniture that is the subject of this article consumes every available inch of a Regency " Ifla in the south of England . The collectors have formed this assemblage over a period of more than forty years . They share a hope held by many dedicated aficionados of the period that the passage of time implied by the advent of the twenty-first century will not spoil their fun by forcing prices beyond the means of those who have for so long championed the cause . In the mid-1950s the rivo young professionals , already conscious of design , moved into their first flat in Hampstead , London . Their landlord gave them one hundred pounds to buy furniture , which they spent on modern pieces from Heals in Tottenham Court Road , London . The first " antique " that entered their apartment was a bulbous upholstered Victorian parlor chair , which they said " looked like a toad . " They bought it for the standard price of four pounds in the Portobello Road antiques market in London , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They now recall how much this long-departed chair amused their friends . Also gone from the early days is a flamboyant silver centerpiece made by Elkington and Company of Birmingham that incorporated deer , grapes , and candle sconces . This was another acquisition subjected , probably unfairly to ridicule . Photograph Fig. 1 . Design for a drawing room cabinet by Bruce J.

The eclectic nature of the collection differs from others more recently formed in that it does not exclude the excesses and eccentricities of Victorian taste to concentrate solely on the protomodern aspects of nineteenth-century design that were the concern of the scholar Nikolaus Pevsner . Today such is the range and quality of their collection that acknowledgments in exhibition catalogues over the past twenty years suggest that few curators fail to inquire what might be available for loan from the collection.4 The growth of cities , towns , fortunes , and a prosperous middle class in nineteenthcentury Britain caused many manufacturers of furniture , ceramics , metalwork , and glass to flourish , as this collection reflects . A city such as Manchester was typical of the age . Its wealth and expansion were based on the cotton industry and other enterprises . By 1838 it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " 5 To meet demand in northern cities such as Bradford , Leeds , and Liverpool , Manchester cabinetmakers enjoyed a considerable boom , one of the most successful being the firm founded by James Lamb in 1843 , which merged in 1898 to become Goodhall , Lamb and Heighway The firm followed rather than created fashion , but on occasion it sought the services of leading designers such as Charles Bevan , who is thought to have worked with and learned from the architect and furniture designer John Pollard Seddon ( 1827-1906 ) .6 Bevan made furniture under his own name ( none of which has been traced ) , as well as supplying designs to Marsh and Jones of Leeds ( 1864-1872 ; then Marsh , Jones and Cribb until 1936 ) and Gillows of Lancaster and London ( c. 1728 or 1729-1900 ) . The cabinet shown in Plate III ' is stamped by Lamb and is in the reformed Gothic revival style associated with Bevan . The attribution to Bevan is strengthened when details such as the side panels , lacquered brass strapwork hinges , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bookcase Bevan designed for Lamb that was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1867.8 Across the room from the cabinet is the lavish octagonal table shown in Plate V. It is part of a suite probably Photograph Pl . III . View of the sitting room . The ebony cabinet was manufactured by James Lamb ( 1817-1903 ) of Manchester tn a design attributed to Charles Bevan ( w c. 1865-c.1883 ) , c. 1865 . The ceramics are all by Minton and Company ( 1793-present ) and date from the 1840s to the 1870s . Many were designed by Christopher Dresser ( 1834-1904 ) . Pl . IV . On the mantel of the sitting room is one of a pair of vases with gilt-bronze mounts made by William Arthur Smith Benson ( 1834 - 1924 ) , and glass by James Powell and Sons of Whitefriars Glass Works ( 1834 1980 ) , London , c. 1900 . Height 11 inches . // dating from the early 1860s that includes a pair of card tables and a small writing table , now all in the Speakers House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger writing table , now in the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne , Australia.9 Although undocumented , it is reasonable to attribute the manufacture of this suite to the London firm of Crate while it was under the direction of John Gregory Crate ( 1809-1889 ) . The table owes a clear debt to Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin and may have been designed by Crate himself , who had a close working relationship with Pugin . Alternatively it may have been designed by his son John Diblee Crate ( 1839-1919 ) .10 The legs of the table recall those on a pair of tables supplied by Crate in 1844 to Knebworth House in Hertfordshire . The marquetry top is a reduced version of the decoration on a series of octagonal tables designed by Pugin and made by Crate in the late 1840s and early 1850s.11 The vase on the table in Plate V is an example of one of the best known forms designed by smile Auguste Reiber ( Fig. 3 ) for the French ceramist Joseph Theodore Deck.12 Although Reiber was associated with Deck from the beginning of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese- and Chinese-inspired metalwork made by the French firm Christofle et Compagnie ( 1830-present ) . A vase of this type may have been exhibited for the first time at the Exposition des arts industriels held in Paris in 1861.13 Such vases , sometimes described as a porte-bouquet , remained in production for some time , 14 and were often reproduced in articles about Deck.15 The collection contains several other notable works by him , including a large plaque painted by another of his long-standing collaborators , Eleonore Escallier ( 1827-1888 ) . The plaque corresponds to examples exhibited at the Exhibition Universelle in Paris in 1867.16 Among the most charming and intimate surviving works by Morris , Marshall , Faulkner and Company ( 1861-1875 ; then Morris and Company until 1940 ) are hand-painted tiles.17 The earliest tiles , with geometric flower patterns , were probably designed by William Morris ( 1834-1896 ) and Philip Webb ( 1831-1915 ) for the Red House , which was built for Morris at Bexleyheath , Upton , Kent , in 1859 and 1860 .

As a result of its display in 1862 , the firm gained the patronage of the watercolor painter Myles Birket Foster ( 1825-1899 ) , for whom it decorated his house in Witley Surrey Above three bedroom fireplaces were tile panels designed by BurneJones entitled Cinderella , Sleeping Beauty , and Beauty and the Beast . The complete Cinderella is in the National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside , Liverpool , 18 but other elements of this design , of unknown provenance , have also survived . The two-tile panel shown in Plate VII depicts the moment the clock strikes midnight and Cinderella runs off , shedding one of her slippers . It must have formed part of one of these early Morris overmantels . The collection contains other tiles from the Cinderella series as well as examples from Sleeping Beauty There are also two framed watercolor designs for tile panels dating from the 1860s , which were retained by Morris and Company until it closed .

The vase was designed by Reiber for the French ceramist Joseph Theodore Deck ( 1823-1891 ) , c. 1865. // The kitchen is as much home to the collection as any other part of the house . The carved oak cabinet shown in Plates I and II is a late work by Bruce J. Talbert . This woodcarver , architect , and furniture designer supplied designs to many cabinetmaking firms , including Gillows , and the London firms of Holland and Sons ( 1843-1942 ) and Collinson and Lock ( 1870-1897 ) . In 1867 Talbert published his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revival furniture . The cabinet in Plates II is closely based on a drawing room cabinet in a later series of softer Talbert designs published posthumously in 1881 as Fashionable Furniture ... ( Fig. 1 ) .19 Such is the quality of the four carved boxwood panels depicting fish and fruit that it is tempting to suggest the hand of a Japanese craftsman employed by the manufacturers . The two robustly carved door panels may be the work of Talbert himself The subjects , it has to be said , seem more appropriate for a dining room than a drawing room.20 Among the more noteworthy objects displayed on and around the cabinet are ceramics and metalwork by John Pearson , who was associated with both Morris and Company and the Guild of Handicraft ( 1888-1908 ) . Just as Victorian designers drew inspiration from the past for their creation of contemporary styles , so too did makers learn from old manufacturing processes while developing new ones . Ceramics designed by Pugin and made by Minton in two old and one new technique are displayed in the collection ( Pl . VI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were designed for a massive stove intended for John Talbot ( 1791-1852 ) , the sixteenth earl of Shrewsbury , at Alton Towers , Staffordshire , and shown in the Mediaeval Court at the Great Exhibition in London in 1851 . The stove itself21 was designed by John Hardman ( 1811  --  1867 ) , another of Pugin 's frequent collaborators . The bread plate was made by the medieval encaustic process whereby clays of different colors were inlaid . Although this plate , first produced in 1848 , is today the sine qua non of most collections of nineteenth-century decorative arts , it was not always so widely admired . A commentator in 1850 wrote : The bread plate is made of the encaustic tile principle : very dark- in colouring and disagreeably associating with the bread . The design might do very well for a pavement , but is rude and coarse , unfit for an object immediately close to the eye on the table.22 The chromolithographed tile shown above the bread plate was based on a design for Pugin 's Floriated Ornament ( 1849 ) .23 It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by F. W. M. Collins and Alfred Reynolds.24 Collecting and studying shells , insects , dried flowers , and stuffed birds and animals were popular pastimes during the nineteenth century . What the collectors call the nature room ( Pl . XI ) reflects this passion and includes furniture , ceramics , and pictures inspired by nature and made from natural materials . Real shells , for example , are juxtaposed with ceramic shells . Perhaps no one learned more from nature than Charles Darwin , arguably one of the greatest figures of the nineteenth century . It was his observations on natural selection in On the Origin of Species ( 1859 ) that opened up the controversial debate on how the human race came to exist . His theories about evolution were both marveled at and ridiculed , as in the parody shown on the plate in Plate XII , which was painted by Joseph Crawhall Sr. , the father of the illustrator and watercolorist Joseph Crawhall ( 1861-1913 ) .

Titles designed by Edward Burne-Jones ( 1833-1898 ) in 1862 and made by Morris , Marshall , Faulkner and Company , c. 1865 . The scene illustrated is from Cinderella . // In a study at the top of the house ( PI . X ) there is an oak writing table close in style to Pugin 's work . It can be confidently attributed to the Crace firm , which also made the oak and marquetry side cabinet , which was supplied to Peter Ormerod of Wyersdale Park , Scorton , Lancashire.25 Near the mantelpiece is an oak reclining chair made by Morris , Marshall , Faulkner and Company . Designed by Philip Webb based on a sketch by G. Warington Taylor ( Pl . VIII ) , this chair was available , usually ebonized , beginning about 1866 . Adjustable chairs were also designed later by other manufacturers , including Liberty and Company in London and L. and J. G. Stickley in Fayetteville , New York . Charles Bevan registered yet another reclining chair ( Fig. 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production.26 An example of the Bevan chair can be seen in Plate V. The work of Edward William Godwin was brought to a wider audience through a major exhibition in New York City last year.27 The circular walnut table shown in Plate XIII is typical of Godwin 's designs and is one of an extensive group of eight-legged tables , some ebonized and some with octagonal tops . The manufacture of the table illustrated is attributed to William Watt of Grafton Street , London , while the octagonal-topped tables are invariably stamped with the mark of Collinson and Lock . The table illustrated is close in design to Plate 12 in Art Furniture Designed by E. W. Godwin FS.A . and Manufactured by William Watt ... ( London , 1877 ) . Although the ebonized and painted cabinet shown in Plate IX has previously been associated with Godwin , 28 recent research shows that it is far more likely to have emanated from the workshop of Cottier and Company of London.29 The emergence of two four-door cabinets30 and a bookcase , all of which can be firmly ascribed to Cottier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with the firm .

In the upper study , the marquetry cabinet and writing table were made by Crace , c. 1860 , and the reclining chair was made by Morris , Marshall Faulkner and Company , c. 1870 . The armchair at the writing table is based on the chair in the Jacobean style first designed in 1867 by Edward William Godwin ( 1833-1886 ) and probably made some ten years later . // The collectors under review have taken a strong interest in the metalwork of William Arthur Smith Benson , feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eclipsed by that of Christopher Dresser . Benson , who was encouraged by William Morris , successfully combined the principles of the arts and crafts movement with the advantages of mass production . His elegantly designed candlesticks , fireplace fenders , and furniture , for example , often made use of identical components in different combinations . As a pioneer in the creation of electric fight fittings , he was not content merely to adapt gas and oil lamps , but found ways to integrate the wiring into the overall design . The collection contains many examples of Benson 's light fittings , as well as a range of his electroplated domestic wares . It is not out of place , however , to single out the pair of gilt bronze and glass vases ( see Pl . IV ) , which were exhibited at the Glasgow International Exhibition in 1901.31 The glass was made by James Powell and Sons of Whitefriars Glass Works , London , which had close associations with other designers and manufacturers , including Philip Webb , Liberty and Company and the Guild of Handicraft .
