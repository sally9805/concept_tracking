MELISSA JOAN HART " I have a new hero in Melissa Joan Hart . Thank you for sharing your struggles and success ! " Erika Remley Orlando , Fla . Thank you for your article about Melissa Joan Hart . It is wonderful to see how this pretty actress got her body back in shape after having two children . I am a working mom -- I just had my second child eight months ago -- and I , too , am in the best shape of my life . I dropped 30 lbs. , in addition to the 30 lbs . of pregnancy weight I lost postpartum . I did it by cutting down on how much I eat , making better food choices and doing exercise after I put my kids to bed -- no trainers , no nutritionists , no gimmicks . Karen New York , N.Y . Way to go , Melissa ! Finally , a celebrity who loses weight without being a spokesperson for a weight-loss company and getting all her meals for free . Indeed , it can be done . Thanks , Melissa , for the inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to know when we can see a man on your cover regarding his weight ? It 's time for a man to step up and be scrutinized for his weight gain . Rachel Rambow via e-mail TERRY CAFFEY Of course Terry Caffey 's daughter , Erin , is crying now . Is n't this the usual behavior of murderers and other criminals ? They become remorseful only after they 're caught and forced to pay for their crimes . This reader is not buying the tears for one second . Lock her up and throw away the key ! Just because her father chooses to forgive her does not mean that an unsuspecting society should be subjected to her continued presence . Monica Niven Chelsea , Ala . This was the most disturbing article I have ever read . Terry Caffey not only has to deal with the horrific loss , every day , but he also must be asking himself where he went wrong with his troubled daughter . God bless him for being able to rise up from what can only be described as a living hell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admired Mel Gibson 's seemingly strong devotion to his wife and children . And though I did not share his strict Orthodox Catholic beliefs , I could respect him for his deep devotion . Well , after reading your article I feel betrayed . Perhaps not as much as his long-suffering wife -- but betrayed and sickened , nonetheless , by his actions . I , for one , will be removing all of Mel Gibson 's DVDs from my collection , pronto . L. Brooks Cary , N.C. KRIS ALLEN Kris Allen is the perfect " poster child " for the many young men and women who are working to follow their dreams . You caught his charm and personality perfectly , and now people all around the world know and admire him the way the people of his hometown , Conway , do . His tenacity , courage and full support of his loving family make his story all the more special . Jan Newton Hicky Conway , Ark . FREE MEDICAL CARE Since our April article appeared on Dan and Suzie Bell and their free Christian Health Outreach clinic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in new donations to make an offer on a building that will house a new clinic and allow them to expand services . " One single mother told us she could n't afford to give much but thought what we were doing was important , and sent $10 , " says Suzie . Adds Ken Covington , who will help run the dental-care section when the facility opens in the fall : " Everyone in the industry is willing to pitch in , from the supply houses to the technicians . " The Bells also continue to receive queries from people across the country who hope to establish similar clinics . In January Melissa Riopel contacted Suzie for guidance and next month is opening a facility in Kingman , Kan . " However we can improve a patient 's quality of life , " says Riopel , " that is what we are shooting for .
