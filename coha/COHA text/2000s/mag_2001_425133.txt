IT 'S ABOUT BALANCE . It has to be-because life plays a mean-spirited prank on us in this decade : At the same time that most of us have our first kids ( or ones who begin asking for soccer coaching and weekend camping trips ) , we 're probably engaged in the most formative-and intense-period of our professional careers . This is the first time most of us feel that we do n't have enough time to ride . On top of everything , our natural athletic growth ends and our bodies can all too easily lose their vitality while gaining pounds . Our metabolism begins to slow-a one-pound-per-year gain after age 35 is common in the U.S. Women 's hormone levels dip . Bones lose density . Our reflexes slow , and our coordination deteriorates-that 's why you fumble your water bottle or , during a tune-up , drop those small parts that bounce away into oblivion . But we 're wiser ( at least compared to our college years ) . We 're no longer penniless , and our diet staples probably are n't ramen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that we can not only match the performances of our 20s , we can exceed them . Like 33-year-old Sarah Halvorson . During her late 20s , in graduate school at the University of Colorado at Boulder , she helped her team to a collegiate national championship , and considered racing full-time . She was a hammer who opted for real life over the proracer gig . Now a geography professor at the University of Montana , she 's traveled the world ; she 's been shunned in Pakistan for daring to ride a bike , and airlifted from Chad when warfare broke out . She speaks obscure Asian and African languages fluently . She 's a new mom . And yeah-still a kick-ass rider . She won the masters criterium national championships for her age group in 2001 , eight months after giving birth . You can have it all . " I do n't think that much about training or focus on trying to maintain a schedule , " Halvorson says . " I used to carefully track miles and hours on the bike , but now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you miss a day of training , it 's okay . " She may not fret her training , but she works hard : Her regime includes off-season weight lifting . Exercise scientists and coaches know that strength training is one of the secrets of bettering the form you had in your 20s . Halvorson credits three-times-per-week lifting sessions during her pregnancy for an easy delivery and recovery . Of course , a pregnancy that included a bike tour through France ( in her fifth month ) did much to keep her from being a pudgy mama . Integrating fitness into daily life is also key to staying fit . Halvorson discovered this when she lived in northern Pakistan for most of 1998 doing dissertation research . " It was offensive to people there to see a woman on a bike . So my aerobic work was helping women weed and haul wood . " Today , she shuttles daughter Solvei four miles to day care by bike trailer , often with groceries in tow as well . ( " There was a heinous headwind yesterday , my heart rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , " she says . ) Every mile counts . " I used to lollygag and do social rides , but it 's more important to get high-quality training time , " she says . She and husband Alex ( a Cat 2 racer ) do intense rides that include sprint and hillclimb efforts . To ride together , the couple trades childcare time with other cycling couples . For racing , they alternate weekends . Look-it sounds like an insane schedule to us , too . But it demonstrates what 's possible in what can be your most frustrating decade , when you 're still basically a prime physical specimen but feel unable to capitalize on it . Yep-your VOsub 2 max has been nosediving since your mid 20s-about 1% per year . But you can offset that by increasing your ability to work at your threshold-if you 'd redline at 82% previously , you can up that to 85% with more targeted training at your lactate threshold . It 's like getting a bigger piece of a smaller pie . A study in Britain of 50-mile time-trial times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to age 40 , where a steady linear decrease began . Plenty of pro cyclists race in their 30s , and some have their best performances . In 1980 Joop Zootemelk won his first and only Tour at age 33-he 'd later win the world championships in 1985 at age 38 . Bjarne Riis took his only Tour in 1996 at age 32 . Andrei Tchmil , now age 39 , is one of the top riders in the classics-the world 's most grueling one-day races . The energy of youth and the wisdom of age-do n't waste your 30s . Savor them .
