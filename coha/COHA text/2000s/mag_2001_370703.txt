WHAT ARE STEM CELLS ? <P> Some call them magic seeds , for their ability to replicate indefinitely and morph into any kind of tissue . Taken from human embryos only days old , stem cells are nature 's blank slates , capable of developing into any of nearly 220 cell types that make up the human body . Scientists believe they will lead to cures for diseases once thought untreatable . <P> 1 EMBRYO An egg is fertilized or cloned to form an embryo . The embryo begins to divide . <P> 2 1 TO 5 DAYS The embryo divides again and again and takes shape as a sphere called a blastocyst <P> 3 5 TO 7 DAYS By this time embryonic stem cells are visible and are capable of developing into any tissue in the body <P> 4 STEM LINE The cells are removed and grown in a Petri dish . As they divided , they create a line of stem cells <P> 5 TISSUE PRODUCTION Using various recipes of nutrients and other factors , scientists hope to turn stem cells into any of the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Pancreatic islet cells Could provide a cure for diabetes <P>  --  Nerve cells Could be used to treat Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's diseases and spinal-cord injuries <P>  --  Muscle cells Could repair or replace a damaged heart <P> FOUR WAYS TO GET EMBRYOS <P> The controversy begins at the source  --  the human embryos that must be destroyed to retrieve stem cells . Scientists can obtain these embryos in four ways , each with its own ethical challenges . The least morally problematic  --  using embryos left over from fertility treatments  --  is the only method Bush is considering supporting . Private groups are already attempting the others . <P>  --  FERTILITY CLINICS During in-vitro fertilization , clinics routinely fuse more than one egg with sperm . That way , if implanting a fertilized egg does n't work the first time , they can try again . This practice has left thousands of unwanted embryos stored in clinic freezers . James Thomson , left , the first scientist to establish a human stem-cell line , used such embryos . <P>  --  ABORTED FETUSES John Gearhart , above right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with first culturing stem cells , extracted his from fetuses donated by women at a nearby abortion clinic . <P>  --  CLONING Advanced Cell Technology of Worcester , Mass. , acknowledged last week that it is trying to create cloned human embryos ( euphemistically referred to as " entities " ) as sources for stem cells . The company has considered selling its stem cells to other researchers . <P>  --  MADE TO ORDER The Jones Institute in Virginia , where the first U.S. test-tube baby was conceived , has mixed sperm and eggs expressly to create embryos as sources for stem cells . <P> WHY DOES FEDERAL FUNDING MATTER ? <P> Since a lab in Virginia has already created made-to-order embryos for stem-cell research , and another in Massachusetts is cloning embryos for the same purpose , it 's hard not to wonder : Is federal money really necessary ? No matter what Bush decides , stem-cell research is sure to continue . But federal funding would dramatically change the scope of this research , widening the circle of scientists involved and most likely accelerating the rate at which cures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YES
