Our condo : a perfectly nice place to live . My mother kept an orderly , clean house . She drove us to school every day and cooked dinner every night . She was a proper lady , the kind of woman who never wore white after Labor Day , crossed her legs at the ankle , and expected her children to be well mannered and respectful . We said please and thank you . We never let the screen door slam . We knew how to set a dinner table . My mother was sweet and warm , and she knew how to make life fun for my brother Jeffrey and me even if there was n't much money . She 'd buy a bunch of beads and we 'd sit by the fire making necklaces . We 'd cover the kitchen table with newspaper and have crab legs like we used to when we lived in Virginia . There was laughing , singing , dancing , and playing dress-up . At bedtime , she cuddled me , held me , called me Laurabelle , my little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a mother does , and we expected them . Five days a week . But when Friday rolled around , everything changed . // Weekends , we entered another world . My dad , John Phillips , was a rock star , the leader and songwriter of the Mamas &amp; the Papas . The Mamas &amp; the Papas were huge in 1966 . Their first album had just come out , and it was the number one album on the Billboard 200 . Money poured in from hits like " Monday , Monday " and " California Dreamin ' . " Dad was fabulously rich and famous . // After school on Friday , a cavernous Fleetwood limo would glide down our street in Tarzana , a suburban neighborhood in L.A. 's San Fernando Valley . The limo would roll to a stop in front of our condo complex . I was six years old and my brother was seven . The neighborhood children would make thrones out of their hands and carry us to the car . As we climbed in , the kids would peer in the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was never in the car . The engine purred , and we slid out of reality . The limo would transport us to either Dad 's mansion in Bel Air or his mansion in the Malibu Colony , where our relatively stable childhood veered down a psychopharma rabbit hole . // I was conceived during a short reconciliation between my parents . As a little girl I hardly lived with my father . My dad had ditched my mother for a sixteen-year-old girl named Michelle when I was two , maybe younger . In the next few years Mom began to work at the Pentagon to support the three of us  --  herself , my brother , and me . There was n't a lot of money , we lived in a small apartment in Alexandria , Virginia , and my mom dated a lot . Every Sunday we had dinner , either at my grandmother Dini 's or at my aunt Rosie 's . Meanwhile , Dad and his new wife , Michelle Phillips , became famous with the Mamas &amp; the Papas practically overnight and lived a recklessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Los Angeles , and eventually my mother moved there too , so now my parents were living in the same city , but in different worlds . Dad and Michelle 's life felt like a fairy tale . She was beautiful and so young , the quintessential California girl . Dad was almost six foot six and dressed in handmade floor-length caftans and the like . He looked ... like Jesus in tie-dye . On weekends Michelle took me clothes shopping at Bambola in Beverly Hills . She bought me tiny kid gloves in all different colors , dresses with matching coats , ankle socks , and Mary Janes . This alone was enough to make a princess out of me , but the dichotomy between my parents ' lives was far bigger than being spoiled with clothes by Michelle . As soon as we drove through the massive wrought-iron gate of Bel Air , the contrast was mind-boggling . We were special . We were royalty . // My father was always surrounded by a noisy , outrageous , wild party . Rock ' n ' roll stars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his homes . He lived beyond his means . There were eight Rolls-Royces in the driveway and two Ferraris . The house was full of priceless antiques , but if something broke , it never got fixed . The housekeeper had n't been paid , or she was fucking my father . There was a cook , but nobody shopped for food . The house was complete chaos , a bizarre mix of excess and oblivion , luxury and incompetence . I swam naked at midnight in the pool or the ocean and scrounged for dinner . I chased the pet peacocks around the estate grounds and had no idea what I might hear or see on any given night . // At the house in Bel Air my brother and I shared a room with twin beds . One night we awoke to hear Dad and Michelle making some kind of ruckus . It surpassed the everyday level of ruckus , so we sat up in bed and started calling for them , " Hey ! What 's going on ? " // Michelle came into the room . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were just playing . " She was carrying a long stick with metal stubs poking out of it . Jeffrey and I looked at each other . This was no innocent game of Monopoly . Years later I channel-surfed past a show about cowboys and recognized the weird stick Michelle had been holding that night . It was a cattle prod . They were chasing each other around with a cattle prod . That may have been an isolated bizarre incident . But life then seemed to be nothing but a long , continuous series of isolated bizarre incidents , so much weirdness every day that the weirdness became everyday . // The Mamas &amp; the Papas played the Hollywood Bowl , a famous amphitheater smack in the middle of Hollywood . It was the Mamas &amp; the Papas ' first formal live gig . Michelle decided to commemorate the event by piercing my ears . I was seven years old , compliant  --  a perfect dress-up doll for Michelle . She sat me on the bedroom floor and gathered a sewing needle , pink thread , ice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear to protect my neck , she forced the threaded needle through my ear , and then tied little peacock feathers ( from the pet peacocks ) to the ends of the pink threads . Michelle had assembled her tools so thoughtfully and executed the procedure so calmly  --  which was even more impressive when I later found out she was on acid at the time . // Barry McGuire , who sang " Eve of Destruction , " was coming with us to the Bowl . He was dressed in a cream-colored suit , but he could n't find his shoes , so he painted his feet green . If I 'd been a few years older I certainly would have figured out that they were all either on acid or , like me , following the lead of those who were . // The Hollywood Bowl show is fuzzy . I was really young . I remember screaming , " Dad ! Dad ! " from the audience . Later , backstage , I met Jimi Hendrix . Jimi Hendrix did n't mean much to me  --  he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Festival , which my father would organize . A giant purple velvet hat floats in my consciousness , attached to the name Hendrix , a vague visual footnote , my own purple haze . // My mother flipped out when she saw that my virgin earlobes had been violated . Pearl studs at eighteen was more her cup of tea . Plus , the threads were n't big enough for earrings and I had to have my ears repierced , and the holes were completely crooked and have been my whole life . For all the asymmetry of my childhood , I 'm still disproportionately pissed off about that . // It was a double life : doing what was expected at my mother 's , and not answering to anyone at my dad 's . I always was aware of the effect my father had on my mom . Even in my seven-year-old brain , I was aware that she was envious , angry , and sad . Often sad . I worried as much as a child can , but the fun at my dad 's was irresistible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the very seductive attitude of " We 're all kids here . " I 'd ask my dad , " Can I go play on the beach ? " and he 'd say , " Whatever turns you on , kid . " So I 'd burst out the back door , free , a crazy kid chasing the dogs on the beach until we were all worn out . Occasionally the cook would attempt to impose a modicum of order . She 'd say , " Now , young lady , you clean your room . Your dad 's going to be mad , " and I 'd say , " No , he 's not . " How could he when he lived so wild ? Meanwhile , in Tarzana , my mom was watching me walk down the street , yelling after me to tuck in my shirt . She was trying her best to raise her kids , but we were being shown another kind of life , and it was no competition . Would you rather live at Disneyland or in a condo in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matterhorn all day long , and the weekends , by moment and memory , dominated the school week . // My dad 's friends never treated me like a child , not exactly . I was more like an accessory , a cute little prop who might amuse or entertain . One weekend before we 'd moved to Los Angeles from Virginia  --  I must have been five or six  --  we were with Dad in L.A. for a visit . His fellow band member Cass Eliot ( the other " Mama " ) had a party at her house in Laurel Canyon . We walked into Cass 's house and there were Paul McCartney and George Harrison . // When I saw Paul McCartney I glommed on to him like a baby groupie . He kept saying , " Go on , love , get up and dance . " In a rare moment of shyness , I demurred . I was afraid people would laugh at me . He insisted . I refused . This exchange circled , a teasing game between a little kid and a world-famous musician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The adults began to point and laugh at the little five-year-old dancing for the rock star . I turned bright red and burst into tears , but then Paul McCartney started consoling me . I was no dummy . I liked being consoled by Paul McCartney . The more he comforted , the more tears I summoned . Finally he picked me up and carried me into a hammock that was suspended in the middle of Cass 's dining room on a pulley . Someone hoisted us up , up , up . The ceilings were two stories tall and we were suspended fifteen feet in the air . I was still snuffling . Paul snuggled up with me until I finally calmed down and eventually fell asleep . The two of us napped together in that hammock , suspended high above the party . You could say I got high and slept with Paul McCartney. // There was something about my father . He was a cool , countercultural guy who attracted some of the most creative people of his time : Mick Jagger , Keith Richards , Gram Parsons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Candy Bergen . Most of his friends did drugs , did n't sleep much , and made lots of money : Excellent role models all . What was it that made my father so compelling ? People were so drawn to him  --  musicians , thinkers , beautiful women . He was tall and cool and always fabulously dressed . He drove fancy cars and threw outrageous parties . He was just as much a master of play as he was a master of music . The world was his drug-rock playground , and everyone wanted a turn on the slide . As his daughter , his light was magnified for me . I always wanted to be closer , brighter , warmer . What was fun and games for his friends would develop into a too-powerful life force for me. // At the time I was still just a kid with a lot of energy . But Dad was n't exactly organizing softball games . The adults at the beach house , and the beach house after that , and the one after that , were always stoned , laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been surrounded by men with guitars . Friends , boyfriends , husbands , son . They sit around , jamming , writing , and talking . That 's where the men-with-guitars theme began , in my dad 's beach houses . // Gram Parsons was a good friend of my dad 's . I did n't know who he was  --  as far as I was concerned he was just a gentle , quiet man who was at Dad 's house all the time and could play the piano like nobody 's business . Dad had a baby-blue baby grand in his bedroom in Bel Air . I 'd sit there on the piano bench listening to Gram Parsons play for hours . Chuck Barris was often there too . I recognized him as the host of The Gong Show . He 'd sit on the couch in a big fur coat , not saying much , not gonging Gram Parsons , just hanging out . But as I look back it 's hard to believe that Barris 's claims to have worked for the CIA were true . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stoned . // Stoner hangs were n't very kid-friendly . I got bored . Sometimes I found ways to entertain myself . I would walk to the market with money my dad gave me , buy seeds , and plant a wildflower garden . Or I 'd climb into my dad 's beautiful old Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud . I 'd drag the neighborhood beach cat into the backseat with me and pretend we were having tea . There was a big phone in that car ; I have no idea how they managed to put a phone in a car in the seventies , but mine was not to question the technology  --  which I was explicitly not to use . The backseat had mahogany tray tables . I 'd pull one down , lean against it , and chat with my friends for fifty dollars a minute . That car phone was the most expensive babysitter in history . // One time when the limo dropped me off in Malibu , I walked in to find a completely empty house . This was not wholly unusual ; I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wondering if anyone would show up , waiting for my father as I often did , when Donovan Leitch walked in the door . " What 's going on , kid ? " // In " Mellow Yellow " Donovan sings , " I 'm just mad about Fourteen / She 's just mad about me , " a lyric that aroused suspicion of pedophilia . But I was only ten  --  still safely under underage . He chatted with me , goofing with the kid who happened to be home , and we decided to make something to eat . We discovered brownie mix in the kitchen and we agreed that brownies would make an excellent lunch . Donovan found a bowl , I got a spoon , we added eggs , we took turns stirring , all the while happily chatting about how yummy they would be . We dug up a pan we were pretty sure would do the trick and put the brownies in the oven . They were cooking ; they smelled delicious ; and then , out of the blue , Donovan said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a cruel joke . // " Why not ? " I asked . // " These are special grown-up brownies , " Donovan said . It turns out Donovan had found my dad 's pot and added it to the mix . Well , that was just plain mean . When he went into the other room , I looked at the brownies . They did n't look different from any other brownies . They sure smelled like regular brownies . I was hungry . And besides , I was in my dad 's house . There were no rules here . I helped myself to a brownie . And another . Next thing I knew everything was funny and Donovan and I were sliding down the banister over and over again . If you do n't count my hammock suspension with Paul McCartney , that was the first time I got high . I was ten . // Two days later I was playing Barbies by the pool in Tarzana with my best friend , Julie , to all eyes looking like a kid who comfortably straddled two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . At Dad 's I was a weird little savage on the periphery , tap-dancing and singing , eager for any kind of attention . I 'd transform over the weekend into an out-of-control little maniac , and when I came home to Mom 's , she 'd spend all week retraining me in manners and etiquette . How hard it must have been for my mother , watching us go off every Friday and knowing that the kids who came home were n't going to be the same . In Tarzana I wanted to fit in too  --  I faked failing an eye test to get glasses and fashioned a retainer out of paper clips so I could look like the other kids  --  but between the controlled order of my mother 's home and the wild freedom of my father 's decadence , I already knew which I 'd choose . I was my father 's daughter .
