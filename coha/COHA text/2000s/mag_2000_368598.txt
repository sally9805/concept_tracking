When he began to work , about 13 years ago , on the project that would ultimately become Bellow : A Biography ( Random House ; 686 pages ; $35 ) , James Atlas could hardly have foreseen that his subject would father a daughter ( at age 84 ) in late 1999 and produce a best-selling novel the following year . Atlas ' book is thus considerably less conclusive than he surely intended . Among his many remarkable achievements , Bellow has outlived his own life . <P> The biographer 's telling of the story so far proceeds smoothly enough but also quietly , since Bellow , like great authors in general , has spent his most adventurous and significant periods alone in rooms , filling up blank pages . The youngest of four children , growing up in Chicago , he decided that he would become a writer and proceeded , with relentless determination , to do so . His early novels attracted critical respect but little money ; he was nearly 50 before Herzog ( 1964 ) produced his first big payday . As his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awards , including the 1976 Nobel Prize for Literature . <P> Bellow 's reputation is now so immense that younger readers may not realize how unlikely his success once seemed , at least to others . Atlas is good at portraying the obstacles the literary establishment placed in the path of a Midwestern Jew . When Bellow graduated from Northwestern University , the English-department chairman told him , " I would n't recommend that you study English . You were n't born to it . " And this was intended as friendly advice . Bellow later resented being labeled a Jewish writer , not because he abjured his faith but because he found attempts to pigeonhole him and his work offensive . He did not join the mainstream of American lit ; he rechanneled it . <P> The private life has not always followed the same glittering arc of triumph as the public one . Atlas rehashes Bellow 's four failed marriages and argues that they can all be traced back to the death of the author 's mother when he was 17 , a loss that left him feeling abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Bellow , " Atlas remarks , " was n't a nurturing person . " On the evidence presented here , it does seem more pleasant to be Bellow 's reader than his spouse . <P> Atlas ' attempts to show that he is not cowed by his subject sometimes take a prim , censorious tone . He mentions the feminists " who were offended , justifiably , by the way he Bellow depicted women in his novels . " That " justifiably " skates over an extremely complex and contentious issue . Can anyone who knows Bellow 's fiction , as Atlas manifestly does , really believe that the work would have been better without its politically incorrect characters ? <P> " The record will show , " Bellow said in 1994 , " what the 20th century made of me and what I made of the 20th century . " That task remains to be done , but this book is a useful and timely step in the right direction . <P>  --  By Paul Gray             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
