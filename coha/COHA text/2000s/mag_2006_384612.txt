WHY HERE , WHY NOW : Steamboat Springs , Colorado , is known as Ski Town USA , but spend one weekend on its plentiful and yet-to-be-crowded singletrack and you 'll think it should be Mountain Bike Town USA . Flan a trip anytime from about early June ( after mud season ) to late September when the aspen leaves melt from green to gold . After a day of punishment nothing feels better than a soak in Steamboat 's Strawberry Hot Springs ( strawberryhotsprings.com ) . And while you 're in town be sure to make an appointment to tour the Moots factory ( 970/879-3067 ; moots.com ) to see where titanium masterpieces are crafted . DIRT : Howelsen Hill is a ski-jumping area ( you 'll see the huge launch ramps on the hill to the southwest of town ) but becomes a singletrack playground in summer , with a maze of trails that 'll keep you busy for days . To get there leave downtown heading east on U.S. 40 ( Lincoln Ave. ) , turn right on 5th St. , go about two blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Park down by the softball fields and start your ride by heading up the switchback trail to the right of the ski jumps . There are marked loops and a ton of unmarked trails , but the area 's small and you can almost always see town down below , so it 's tough to really get lost . For longer loops and bigger elevation gain head to the Steamboat Ski Area where 50 miles of trails top out on the Continental Divide . To get there from downtown take US 40 east , exit Mt Werner Rd. , turn left , then follow the signs to the Knoll parking lot . The gondola can take you and your bike to Thunderhead , about halfway up the mountain , but you got ta pedal if you want to go to the top . It 's worth the effort , though . You 'll be rewarded with big views and smooth , buffed-out singletrack snaking through lush aspen groves where afternoon thunderstorms can turn the usually dry trails into damp , tire-dripping ribbons of traction . Put Sunshine and Valley View @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out Pete 's Wicked , where switchbacks through late summer wildflowers will make you grin with glee . SHOP : If you forget something or break your dusty steed go to Orange Peel Bicycle Service ( 1136 Yampa St. ; 970/879-2957 ; orangepeelbikes.com ) , where master mechanic/owner Brock Webster and his gang will get you back on the trail more quickly than anyone else in town . They have a full line of bicycles ( Moots , KHS , Ellsworth and Kona ) , accessories and trail maps as well as a rental fleet . If they 're swamped try the Ski Haus ( 1457 Pine Grove Rd. ; 970/879-0385 ; skihaussteamboat.com ) . They sell Specialized , Cannondale , Rocky Mountain and Giant bikes as well as accessories ; they also rent bikes and have camping gear . GRUB : Steamboat has more snooty restaurants than you can shake a broken spoke at , but there are a few high-quality yet affordable gems . Before shredding Steamboat 's tasty singletrack , fill your tank at Freshies ( 145 Trafalger Drive ; 970/879-8099 ) . They have great coffee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you craving something with a high calorie content look no further than the Double Z Bar and Bar-B-Q ( 1124 Yampa ; 970/879-0849 ) . Try their delicious BBQ pork sandwich . For something a little less messy hit Tequilas Family Restaurant ( 425 Lincoln Avenue ; 970/879-5500 ) and have the best chile verde in Colorado . CRASH : If you want the convenience of having trailheads at your doorstep , try one of the many condos available at the base of the Steamboat resort ( 800/922-2722 ; steamboat.com ) . Expect to pay about $150 a night for a one-bedroom unit . Or stay at the Rabbit Ears Motel ( 201 Lincoln Ave ; 800/828-7702 ; rabbitearsmotel.com ) , which is located downtown and has rooms starting at $95 . It 's about a three-minute ride to Howelsen Hill and about 100 yards from the bike path ; it 's about a 20-minute warm-up ride on the way to the trails at the Steamboat resort. - Ron Koch Sidebar <p>
