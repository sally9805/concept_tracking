I begin to see the possibilities in dehydration just about now . Dehydration-a tantalizing word . <p> Fog without moisture , space without stars or solar magnificence . Somewhere hidden are heaps of stone our guide found last week and , in our group 's wandering about , lost again . <p> An effluvium of dust has hung over us for two months now , almost three , shielding us , or so the crew would hope perhaps , from excess of sun . Each day it is impossible to see for more than a few feet at best-or even to stumble into anything we came to investigate . How blinded we are , even while seeking a whole army of men : sixty thousand souls and their wives , goats , camels , children , slaves , and upkeep , even the smallest sign . <p> The party has begun to relegate their lost fantasies : if not the sixty thousand , then perhaps their families or their soup cups or their petrified saddle blankets , if not a mummified baby , then perhaps small evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones disturbed on the silk road , fires immobilized by sand so blanketing . None has surfaced , since they set out across the desert two thousand years ago , to mark rite , significance , human bond , purchase , lost tooth , flicker . Somewhere the dead army drifts about still . <p> In all this stinging , blinding sand , my arms are too long for me to see my own hands , much less to work with anything . <p> Heat vertigo sets in , round and round as if we have fallen down a well and are falling still . <p> " No , " I say , " something else . It is n't right . ' <p> " We ca n't stop coughing either , you know. , ' <p> " First the vertigo then your dust storm coming in . ' <p> " I have the fever . " <p> " Always that European , this American , has fever in the desert . " <p> " No , or yes ? Inch Allah . " Ramon lays his hand on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand , John Brimmer . " <p> I place my elbow against my side again , just checking-for my pistol . It has n't fallen from my pocket . I take my own turn at breaking down . Like the rest of them . All of us . But I rest my head on her chest . I cry like a baby . Every channel in me is spiraling , drying , flaking , curling inward in the undertow , and going down . I clutch at her as if she can stop it . Insides so completely tattered : flapping , unkempt , antediluvian sails for lungs . Without benefit of water . <p> " What is it ? " she says , crouching beside me . " What 's the matter ? " <p> The acrid smell turns around in me . And I see it again : the jeep moves , driving in circles , in search of the water someone I trusted holds . Their eyelids have curled back like dead leaves and dried to their skulls , their eyeballs mere burned-out flashbulbs popping out of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them points . <p> I am holding to the one soiled corner of earth that I have chosen . It wo n't stop whirling . I am puking into a millennium of pivoting grains . Again and again she puts her hand at the back of my neck . Up it comes , further evidence . <p> " Buck up , Birdy , " she says . <p> I close my eyes so I wo n't have to see the blinding brilliance of her red hair in sunlight . <p> She knows it is solely my fault that we have come here . I ca n't stop retching now . Whatever happens , has happened , will be my fault . <p> Piers and Ramon lift me up onto the saddle of their arms . Piers puts a drop of water on my tongue . <p> " Every time I go on one of these so-called geographical investigations , " Piers says , " some batch of these touring explorer types-stick out your tongue , I said-goes paralyzed . In the rain forest six months , and they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ca n't walk . You 'd think they 'd been beaten with a pipe . Here 's your little vertigo , then . Why ca n't you drink what I told you ? Open up his beak . He 'll never get it in with all this shivering and twitching . I told you , you of all persons , to drink more than you ever thought you could . Now , Birdy , ' - is n't that what she calls him ? Birdy ? ' - now , Birdy , ' open up and be a good capitan . <p> Fearless leader , we 're going to have to force some fluids now . Pour it down him . " <p> " Next time I 'd rather shove it up his nose , " Ramon says later , moving as if in secret just outside our tent . <p> " With a straw . We did that once to Stevens . A long one . Very long . " <p> " Tricky . Or up his ass . " <p> " I would n't want to get that close , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My red-haired wife has come into the cave now . I turn over just as she kicks at the dreamed remains . The femur of a skeleton tips , rises , points directly at her face . That is enough to put you in a damnably bad mood by mid-morning . <p> " Always I have been led by love , " he said , ever earnest , to my wife , Isabella . " Or something very like it , anyway-oh , I just do n't know- " <p> " My god , " I say . " Ho ! What vertigo ! " Or , has the horizon shifted again ? Acres and acres of sand shift by in front of us . <p> " See that , " I laugh . " You know you are going to get the wind knocked out of you when you see that . Probably for good . In ten minutes give or take a few . ' The wall is nearly nine thousand feet tall as it swirls above the dunes in a steely , carbonic-looking , bluish dirt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My red-haired wife is sitting in a hole she 's dug , looking at her fingers . <p> " They 're gone ! " <p> " What 's gone ? " I ask her . <p> " Every one of them is gone ! Can it be the heat ? " <p> " What is gone , for Christ 's sake , Isabella ? " <p> " The moons in my fingernails . Every one of them is completely gone . <p> " That 's very strange , Iz , " I say , trying to appear interested . " Maybe the heat is getting to your eyesight . It 's certainly done mine in , I must say . " <p> " Let me see your nails , " she demands . <p> I hold out my hands , feeling ridiculous . " Of course , " I say . " Have a look at them-you 're my wife . Look at any part of me you want . It 's in the contract . Even palm reading-must be in the fine print . " <p> " Completely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone , too. , <p> And they are . I look at them . I push the cuticle back a little bit . " The sun in abundance , but no moons . " I shrug up my shoulders . " It certainly is odd , Isabella . But for me , I 'm sorry , it does n't move the whole earth , if you see what I mean . I 've got work to do here . " <p> But there they are , my fingers baked completely brown and creased like a grandfather 's and not one nail has a moon in it . <p> " Call the others over , " she says . <p> They hold out their hands . <p> Anne , concerned , pretends to giggle . <p> " You ca n't keep me in the house if I do n't wan na stay here , Daddy , " Piers screams , dancing around , his arms behind his back , clowning as always-as always , an irritation . " I 'll go out my window , just you wait and see me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last of my tail feathers in this dirt , Big Daddy , if you 're gon na put your nail cleanliness plan ahead of other truly important personal hygiene problems-belly-button odor stoppage , for instance . I , for one , have dirt in everywhere . And toenail control ! " He rips his boots off . " My toenails are too long for my boots , Admiral ! And I ca n't find my sterling-silver nail clippers . Take your hands off my fingers , man ! I 've got gray roots coming in . Look at your own goddamn nails . Let go , I say . I say , let go . I do n't care if you are the Admiral or the Commodore or whatever you claim to be . Get your freaking hands off , right now , of me ! " <p> At night we freeze , shaking under metallic blankets . By day the heat passes 120 , yesterday pressing 13o degrees . We have ceased to sweat . And with each sandstorm , the static electricity is so great , our heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her headaches finally . With an umbrella . She goes everywhere creating shade and then driving the metal shaft into the sand , grounding herself . <p> " Wear your high heels , too " I try to laugh . " They must have metal in them . " <p> " You laugh , " she says . " Go on and laugh , Birdy . But you 're the one going round and round with a seismic eruption in your brain stem . " <p> " Oh , please do n't talk so loudly , Iz , " I say , clutching at my temples . " Oh , now I know why the ostrich does that weird act . " <p> Iz drives her umbrella into the ground like a cane , and out comes a fierce rattle like a snake . She jumps nearly half a foot and runs the rest of the way back to me . I jump , too , for pity 's sake . <p> " Jesus , Birdy , " she says . " I nearly skewered a rattlesnake . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tapped and suckered by a rattler . " But it is not a rattler Iz finds when she goes to dig him out , wearing the bite-proof gloves , a helmet , and other amulets . It 's amazing she does n't collapse with all that stuff on . " Temperature control , temperature control , " I remind her . <p> " Here , Birdy , " she says . She holds out in her palms a set of baby owls , and there at the back of their rattling fearful beaks is the rattling sound . After everyone has seen and photographed them , she puts them safely back . <p> The crew trudges doggedly by , sneering at the end of the day , dragging the metal scanners to and fro . The upper crusts of all their skins seem to be peeling back to reveal a uniform fleshypink interior . The sand is so hot now that even in the early evening , we can hardly walk on it . It 's as if we have no shoes on . Now the sun plunges down behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocking back and forth under all creation . You can barely hear the wind coming up for all the clackings of teeth . We are like wind-up party skeletons . <p> Men crossed this moonstruck terrain with nicknamed camels , wives and lovers , children , wagons , water . An army stretched out for miles under these stars , traveling by night for energy . Or , I say to myself , maybe they did n't need to . All were lost to a shift in sand without one trace . Soon we start working under the floodlights . How many days and months have passed here ? <p> " You 've found it ? " We are working by night now under floodlights . Supplies will be dropped in the morning if Right-Reg , as we call him , can find us after the storm . Already camaraderie , purpose break down here . <p> " Come look- " I say . It rises up from out of the dunes . Greek . Or Roman . I have such vertigo I do n't know . " It 's Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You do n't know which ? " <p> " Come look at it , I said ! " <p> " We 're not interested . " <p> " Look at it anyway ! " I say . <p> " It 's not what we came for . ' <p> " How can you not look at it ? " <p> I am alone , far off from our base camp , when I find it . A hull . Two hundred skeletons chained in the hold . Northern Africans enslaving Central Africans ? Giant oars in hand , what is left of them . Bolt upright . On deck a skeleton reclining . Gold around the neck . I have never seen anything like it . Ruby pendant sunken like a heart through his fallen sternum-into the violin case his ribs still make . <p> My wife shrugs up her shoulders when I get back to camp to tell them . She mutters something behind my back . Sneers . As though I can not hear her . <p> " 1953 . " <p> " What did you say ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go ahead , knock me over " Iz says to me . <p> " Yeah , go ahead , " Allan says . " We 're rolling here . I 'm recording . <p> " What did you say ? " I say to her . I have never knocked her over , or even hit her . " Just tell me . What did you mean , 1953 ? " <p> " Someone sighted one in 1953 . I ca n't remember the name now . <p> Allan groans . " Starving and thirsting to death with Greco/Roman pseudo-archaeologists . Sent by shiny magazines . " <p> I have lost all of my former demeanor in these environs . " Would you just come look at the boat I found ? You wo n't believe it until you see it . Truly , you wo n't regret it . " I think I must have lost my mind , I am so dehydrated , I am whining . " Would you just come with me to shoot the film . That 's what you 're here for . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the next storm . We go by compass , following the charts I 've made . Rising and sinking as we hike . The witch under the desert sucks us into her bosom . <p> " Yeah , " Annie complains . " If only we had a good gaffer we could hang on to the boom , skip over these sand piles . " <p> " We 're just about there , " I say repeatedly to their repeated silence . " I know we 're just about there . I 've marked it on my map . " No one is answering . Everything looks completely different today . The day is scorching and windless . No one is saying that normally they would be in their tents readying themselves for sleep at this time of the late morning . Those are my new rules . No one is saying it . <p> " You 've really lost them now , " Isabella does say , trudging along beside me with her umbrella . " Do you know it ? They 've no respect for you . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one thing , and then you insist on another . " <p> Allan hands over the camera to the young kid . The young one aims , not at the boat . They are an eighth of a kilometer short of it . It 's Piers . <p> Piers is dancing and chanting . He looks like a goat with that brown goatee . If only he had any sense of rhythm . " Take off these clothes , this skin , my putrid flesh ! " he yodels . " Just please oh pleasy , leave me my one good bone to make the music twang ! One good thang to make me sang . Oh pleasy- " <p> " Here " Allan says , affecting , " this be a good one for your archives , mate . Best caption : workers cool themselves at the site . " He drops his pants and bends over for his own timed shutter . <p> " Oh , why do n't you old boys just grow up , " Annie grumbles . " Anything to show off your yayas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Piers says , smiling out from between his own legs . Richardson pipes up : " That 's Greek , I think so . " <p> " Latin , I would say , " Richardson chimes in . " Would n't you say so , Izzy ? " <p> " I would , " my wife , Isabella , says . " Definitely Latin . " She lends a hollow laugh . <p> I do n't need to say anything when we arrive at the site of my discovery . Allan turns the camera on it . He shoots the whole thing . Even Piers is in awe of it . Even though it is decidedly not the army for which we 've been looking . " Mud . It 's preserved in mud , " Piers ponders . " If the mud were n't here first , they would all have to have been exfoliated . There had to have been-I am wrong here ? " Even before he can say it , everyone stares at him . <p> " Have we got evidence of the Great Flood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , hours later we are all yet making our drawings and recordings . I am aware of the daylight passing out from under the knobbed legs of Ramon 's camel . So there , I tell myself , we may have all of us lost our dignity a month ago , gone increasingly mad even , but we have n't completely lost our sense of purpose . <p> The first thing Isabella did when we got here was to hit her head on the dashboard when the jeep took a lurch . Ramon was driving . For some reason , whenever Ramon drives it feels like he is out of the body of the car , he can see that far ahead . It is as if he is a figurehead , some kind of sleek animal fixed to the front of the hood . His head swivels toward Iz in the back seat . " Head all right , missus ? Wait till you have your own camel . " <p> " Rather a stupid start , Iz , " I said then , continuing the argument that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit yourself , too , " she said . " You 're just as stupid . " <p> " I want to laugh out loud , " I said . " I should have left you in New York . ' <p> " Do n't think I came just because I wanted to be with you . Do n't flatter yourself , Birdlet . " <p> " I can think of other people who would have come with me , " I retorted against my better judgment . <p> " I 'll bet you can ; ' Iz said . " I 'll bet Miss Nosegay was ready to leave behind everything like I have . I 'll bet she was ready to charge right into your charts and your sandpit . " <p> Ramon turns to me and says : " Homesick ? " <p> " Stop it ! " Isabella screams at me . " Stop it ! " Before she can stop me , I have kicked one of the microlites into rubble . I am in motion toward the tent , and then I am lying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembling . If I do not move perhaps the whirling will not begin . A thunderous pain goes up the back of my head and into my eyeballs . I ca n't stop screaming it . Three months in 120-degree heat for something already sighted ! In 1953 ! Surely Isabella has made this up to spite me . It would not be beyond her at this point . <p> " I do n't suppose it ever occurred to him , " Piers is saying , " that maybe their buttons were made out of bone . " <p> " Yeah , " Allan says . " Myself , I 'd rather be looking for a great big juicy T-bone steak . We could hang it up and drink the blood , at least . " <p> " Always ! Always ! Always ! To get an A , do your research ! " Piers screeches . <p> " I like that word ever so much : juicy . " <p> The tent stake has started to move now , the one beside the cot just beneath where my face presses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Birdy " <p> " Yeh . Maybe they had zippers . We could find a metal zipper . ' <p> " Two-thousand-year-old wank caught in inventive metal appliance . <p> Ramon whistles . " I catch mine , feels fifty thousand dead souls screamin : That is your real thing . " <p> " If sixty thousand can be lost in the one sandstorm , " Annie says , " do you guess that makes us darn near invisible- " <p> " Boys and girls ! No more sandstorms ! " <p> " And do n't forget those little women and children howling , " Allan calls from behind the radio he 's building up again from scrap . " ' Empathologize ' that one ! And do n't forget- " <p> Piers and Ramon sing out in what they think is my voice . " All those animals . Lost , alone and wailing in the desert ! Try to imagine something , Piers , for once in your lifetime . " <p> They do sound just like me , in stereo . <p> " Please , Birdy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's give it up . I want to see my own children . All this romanticizing the past is killing us . " <p> I see her body disappear behind the earth from the waist up , and then , too , her red head bobs down , and I am staring once again into the sandbox . <p> Who could ever bring them together in one woman-my Rose and my Isabella ? Heaven and earth , wife and lover , sand and water . <p> Ramon does n't slip in grit , ever . When he takes off his right shoe , my wife gazes at his arch , the long slender second toe rising up over the first . Sand pours out of his sole , from out the interstices . Isabella glances sideways-to see if I am looking at my wife staring into the pupils of a man soon to be a dead one . <p> Isabella journeys to the other tents to talk to the men there . She also likes Piers 's girlfriend , Anne . They sit around laughing while I draw charts . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always shifting , and the bottom is a layer of shale . Any of us can see that . When the dunes part , a sidewalk of brimstone opens in front of us . Then here , then there , stone monuments begin to emerge on the ancient trade route . It is just like I 've said over and over that they would . The Bedouin still know their way by these . The others look to me for answers . It 's not the heat , it 's not the infinite small particles of dust turning into living things that bore into your eyes and skin as if with wings . It 's not the wind that stings here . <p> Heavy seas , he says and laughs . She laughs , too . Her eyes are blue , luminous . Ramon laughs back , his body tight . His back ripples with the physique of a male bobcat . <p> Our scanners go back and forth over dunes looking for metallic artifacts . Piers wears a towel under his baseball cap . The hem flies about his shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunes his radio . " Radio Riviera ! We 're getting it ! 0 sacred golden Oldness ! " Piers aligns us with The Police : " Every move you make- " Sting sings . <p> " Male version of ' I will follow you , " ' Piers laughs , chanting along then . <p> " I like it , too , " Richardson chimes in . " My favorite . That guy 's got a voice I wish to God you had right now , Piers . " <p> I mark off my grid and dig in my hole as usual , scraping delicately , brushing . Isabella in her long white shirt glances up from her site . She has a red silk scarf tied back under her hair at the nape of her neckline . Everyone has grown a little thin , Iz especially . She wears the shirt to conceal it . <p> " Tea in the Sahara with You ! " Ramon shouts at her hopefully . We all pause , waiting for the disc jockey to settle on the next tune . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cranks it to maximum volume . " I was wrong ! This one , this one , this one ! It 's my favorite ! " <p> " I 'm from the lowlands " belts out over the sand dunes . <p> The first tear tracks down her cheeks like a small animal as my Isabella slumps down on the hillock . It is as if the song has finished her off finally . She is a lump in a hummock of fine grit ; dirt frosts her arms and legs , the end of her nose . The other teardrops are not far behind . I can see her from here , but I am digging . I am digging toward a strange fleck on the screen . Then the others follow . And the voice quavering . I almost do n't hear it anymore , the tears for the lost brother . It will not be the last time I will hear Isabella . Another lost one . I do n't have to do much for her in this moment . Ramon takes full advantage . It is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isabella is really crying now . I have n't heard her sob like this for years . I look up to see what stage she is in this time . Her voice shudders like a rod is pressing intermittently against her throat . She gasps and snuffles . Ramon has his arm around her now . Just as I am getting to the bottom of the pit I have circumscribed here , " Brothers in Arms " wails out over the complete endless fuddy-duddy earth , egging her on with its keening and exquisite clarity . Now again she has begun to ruminate : <p> " I lost him in that stupid fucking war . He was sweet and smart , and my father made him go there . " The others stand to look at her with pity . All their emotions frayed , every last one of them has taken to bursting out in moments previously unfathomable . Still it 's embarrassing to see Isabella blubbering , her khaki legs crossed up under her like she 's going to meditate , her sunburned face down in her hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squats down beside her , puts his arm around her . Anne sits down next to her . " Oh what the fugue , " Piers says , yet again . " We all need a good cry . At least we 've got a very good reason this time . ' He sits his khakis down to the other side of my private darling . He puts his arm around her , too . Piers and Ramon 's arms make a kind of armed boa across her spine as it dances . <p> " Everything all right over there ? " I call . <p> No one answers . There is even a remarkable lack of movement in response . I send up a rain of it : burial dust for the brother-inlaw I never knew . This magic turtle pulls his head in . <p> " Something 's turned up on the scanner , " I say . " Hey , guys , maybe this will lift your spirits . " <p> " I always cry when I hear that song , " Isabella sniffs . The music plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I nursed my first baby to that song . " She sniffs again . " And now I wonder if I 'll ever get home to him . Why ca n't we just get home again ? Out here going around and around some senseless lost phantoms . We buried my brother to that song , under a flag , as if by then it mattered to him . " She sniffs again . <p> Ramon kisses the side of her face , turns her head to meet his bold one . He bumps his forehead against hers gently . " Of course it mattered . " <p> No one even looks at me . " Hey , Ramon , " I say , " maybe we 've got a button here . Maybe we 've actually got it . " <p> It 's my Isabella who finally looks at me and says in one highpitched devotion : " Okay , okay , Birdy , do n't worry , I 'm coming . " <p> Everyone follows as if in a gaggle , and gathers around me now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dig with our fingers like very patient dogs . Just to irritate me , Ramon shouts , " Eeeeha ! " It 's his " American " joke , but just this once I believe he means it . Isabella hunkers over us at the edge , staring down the pit in awe and disbelief . She is not closer to him than she is to me , I notice . <p> Piers waves his metal detector at us . " You 're hitting right on top of something . Less'n you dropped your hunting knife down there , Admiral . " He knows we carry no metal with us . We are completely undetectable . Piers has come up with such jokes on our invisibility , I do not now want my memory to reiterate them . " Edge a little more right , another centimeter . It 's shifting into a pocket . A little more , you 're almost on it now . Go on , man , screw it to the ground . " <p> A glint comes up at us-off of Izzy 's red hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I do n't know whether it 's a joke or not , but Piers starts to cough as well . " Swing low , sweet chariot , " he chokes for real now . <p> " Comin ' for to carry us home . " <p> " Find the sucker , " Anne breathes . I can see her silhouette now , holding to Gerard 's arm . " Find it , and let 's get the hell out of this fucking hellhole . " Piers fires up his camera . <p> Ramon reaches in . <p> Tears fire onto my jaw between coughs and gagging . I am doubled over in the pit . I am surprised to hear how high my voice can go-caught this way by some kind of persistent grip around my chest and throat . Everyone waits around me . " Do n't anybody touch the fucking thing ! " I gasp . I take the handkerchief from my mouth , and for just one second everyone sees it as I see it , too . For the first time . It 's on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mucous . It is as if someone has thrown my blood onto a windowpane now in front of us . There 's a splash of red wherever I look , sprinklings of my own ruby-mottled shock . Even in the pit , there is a sparkle in red . I cram it into my pocket . <p> I reach in through the granules of air undulating before me . The object is only slightly cooler than the sand around it . Almost imperceptibly cooler-so like the air that hovers next to the earth here in the shadows . Shadows are well worth hunting here , I say to myself almost as if in a refrain ; how many times have I said that ? It has become a chant for good luck . I can feel the fragment 's weathered surface on my forefinger , almost smooth on one side , the other patterned against my thumb . Perhaps a coin . Something familiar . Two thousand years , I think , oh pleasy . From your lost lives to me here , commemorating . Before we can even think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pray for it . " <p> I pull it up and lay it in my palm . I hold it out for all of us to see at once . And we all look at it : a swastika . <p> Even Piers says nothing . He does n't have to say it . No one has to say it . He 's taunting me in his brain . I can hear him ; he does n't have to say it . " Is anyone homesick yet ? " <p> Iz flops backward on the dunes from where she kneels , her legs twisted under her . She denounces the sky with her mocking bird laughter . <p> That would have been the next morning when they headed out with the jeep for water , just before the storm , Gerard and Richardson . They saw the canister in the rearview mirror and reversed all the way into camp . I had just pulled our emergency container off as they were driving out ; they thought I would n't see them absconding with it . " What 's the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H2O , " I laughed . " We could wait an eternity while you guys tremble at the oasis , crouched over your own reflections . Bare shoulders in a wet black pool . And all the rest . Poetic . " Their faces were blank with anger . Even after all my good-natured prattling , they were still speechless and staring . <p> " Stop glaring at me , " I said . " Have you gone insane ? I have everyone here to think about . All of us , every last little chickadee , get it ? " <p> " This is insane , " Ramon stepped in . " What you do to them is insane . They must take our water . " <p> " We must keep the water , " I said . " They must fetch the water . If they do n't come back , we 'll all perish before that freaking plane finds us . Do n't you get it , Right-Reg is off somewhere eating pomegranates this week . ' <p> So then I sit down on the canister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by remote control . I can see that he suggested that they take it . " What 's the matter ? You 've never seen a man sitting on a water barrel with a gun pointed at you in this your private desert ? Here I am . There you are . You 'll be back in three hours . Without you we 're dead . It 's not like you do n't have your canteens with you , guys , and the cigarettes , and also the chewing gum to generate spit if you need , and two or three bottles of contraband Coca-Cola . And an immense canister of clean water I put in the back for you myself . There 's two of you , then there 's all the rest of us . Would you rather I went ? I 'd be happy to take a little jaunt in the desert . " " We split it , " Ramon cries out . " Of course . That is what you meant to say . They merely misunderstood you . " <p> " We do not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water out to a watering hole . At this particularly low point in time . I hunker down on the tin can and put the gun across my kneecap . " It 's very simple , Ramon , " I say . " Now that our usual airdrop has failed us , now that our tiny footprints might as well be the tracks of your favorite little sand grouse , Ticky ticky , ' is n't that his name , Ramon ? Now that we seem to be completely lost as far as the supply planes are concerned , it 's a preservation hierarchy . Do you know what a preservation hierarchy is , Ramon ? Gerard ? Richardson ? " <p> " But we have three barrels . To us it would make no difference . To them , if they need one , it makes everything . " <p> But I refused to budge ; in my gut I knew . " It will make a difference , " I said , and in the end it did . It would save some of us , anyway . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then the drifting masses of dust . By mid-morning still they had not come back to us . I figured they had driven right out of the desert . <p> Before noon a layer of sand hovered over the ground as far as we could see . Below our knees everything had been cut off from our vision . And then we saw the dust storm coming at us like I 'd dreamed it would : the great wall of China moved toward us with a constant speed that was horrifying . We dropped the tents and took refuge with everything we could manage in the vehicles . Inside them , everything by day had never ceased to bake since the day we 'd come here . Fruitlessly Piers turned on his radio for a moment , seeking our long lost days of dreaming we were on the Riviera . Then he snapped it off again without ever knowing whether or not it had come on in all the roaring . Beside me , Ramon swayed back and forth in agony , calling out the names of his friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front seats . Piers held him down while I poured the water in . In the back seat , Iz would not say a thing to any of us . Somewhere very close were the other vehicles , though we could not see or hear them . Someone gigantic was throwing buckets of sand at us . We wrapped our shirts around our heads . <p> Finally I could hear Piers rather humbly saying : " I 'm sorry , Birdy . I really am , man . I 'd rather it had been a peace pin . I mean , if it had to be recent history , Birdy . " <p> Today I take the plane up . To look . For Gerard and Richardson , for anything nearby , so I say , anything that is helpful . We do not have enough gas to get back . The headache recedes little by little and is gone on a wing of its own clouds . <p> " To go home would be helpful , " someone says . I think I can hear it , even up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultralite up . I am free of sand at last . I float on currents of wind as if in my own little boat . Shimmering waves of heated air stretch all around me . Far below , I wish to have imagfined it : an endless , waterless beach where tiny people dig an oblong pit . You do n't have to tell me what they are doing . They are burying one of our drivers . You , too , are down there , Iz , in the heat with your well-polished shovel . <p> False water swarms around me . When I land no one speaks . This is your fault , they seem to say , for your ignorance , your selfish timing . Go to your God , then , I say silently to them , if you did not wish me to save your petty lives . Would you rather it had been all of you , then ? <p> " Ramon is dead , too , " my wife says . She drives the umbrella into the ground like a tent pole . Tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she leans over the place where already the pit has been covered over and grows indistinguishable . <p> " May he go with God , " I say as gently as I can muster ; even I can hear the hard edge in it . A freight train splits my temples . The unrelenting dunes spin round and round me . " May Ramon live with his God forever . " <p> My wife slaps my cheek then . Before I can stop myself , I have knocked her down just as somehow Piers and Allan predicted . I stand over her , stunned at this first violent performance in my whole lifetime . She lies , one leg twisted under her , staring at me in disbelief . <p> " I do n't suppose the two of you could do that again " Allan says . The eye of his camera points directly at us . " I missed the part where the wife fell on the grave of her lover . " <p> I shove her into the tent ahead of me . No one follows or even looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So you 're the only one , " she sobs . " All these years I 've put up with your precious Rosebush . You 're the only one , " she sobs , " who can have a lover . " <p> " Oh , give up , Iz , " I say . " Have a cry over your wilderness booty if that 's the inhuman way you want to think of him . At least you know I love her . " For the fourth time I have come upon it . And the fifth time now as I circle . <p> A star-shaped dune is relatively stable ; but the barchan may shift location as much as five and a half feet a month . I am thinking , to be lost in the sea of sand could be like falling into God 's navel . <p> These , then , Isabella , are the dunes in the sea of sand : ridge dune , star dune , crescent dune . Ridge dunes , Rose , run parallel and are called transverse . They stand at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see here . The star-shaped dune can be most magnificent in the Sahara , some reaching two hundred sixty feet high , no kidding . The star dune is the result of multidirectional wind . At the edges of the desert where there is little sand , the barchan crescent-shaped dune is formed , little wonder . There the wind blows mostly from one direction , coming over the outer curves of the crescents toward the pointed ends in whitecaps . <p> Alone I have wandered out in search of something or someone , I forget which . Thrice I have come upon the Place of the Button , as Piers now calls it . Thrice I have come upon the terrifying knowledge of my circular being . <p> They told me before I came here that the temperatures in the desert would vary greatly between night and day . Even gigantic dunes , as I understood it , were first formed when drifting sand was halted by a fixed or stationary object-for instance , even a seemingly insignificant form of plant life . <p> I have read that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour while walking in the desert . In addition , it is necessary to take in salt . One comes to understand the phrase , the salt of the earth , then . <p> In dehydration , it is easy to experience debilitating heat cramps . <p> Who wore this button ? By choice ? Or by command ? Man ? Or poor , voiceless young boy under orders ? A willful act ? Or otherwise ? Who wielded the needle to stitch it into place , perhaps several times as it fell off during practice ? With what bodily tears was he sent off by boat and then to this ruined oasis ? It is hard to imagine all the endless seams of young boys , barely through with playing at marbles , that unravel here <p> How do we even know any of it is going round ? I am thinking the vertigo of the desert is barely anything . It is all so much the same here . Yet I know it is actually pivoting this time . I walk in circles now around the only thing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am all laughter and keening song now . I am glaring at my own two feet walking in a two-meter radius , round and round a single button while looking for an old boat . Here I am ! Here I am now ! And going around here <p> The sun is most interesting now , how dependable . And deplorable . I take off my clothes and cover myself with sand as best I can . Patting it down up to my armpits . Around one shoulder , anyway . To get out of the sun , I prop my hat over my hairline . I did not want to find it . It is not what I came here to find . " Ancient armies are pure ! " I shout as if into the button in my pocket flung across a sand dune . I can barely see it . " Give us ancient armies ! Time purifies their intentions ! Ancient armies are most pitiable and exotic ! " I shout . " They were real men ! And boys , defenseless to wind ! To sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children ! Pet birds ! And grandparents ! " I scream . " They had no weapons like we have . They killed the best way they could ! They were ancient ! " I would like to lie down now if I were not so well packed in . I inhale the moisture winging its way on the cloud of a breath now , just under my hat . That might be my own dream coming this way . I take a deep rest . Every once in a while I might raise up my hat , wave it feebly around now with my one free arm-signaling for a little something or other , if you see what I mean just perhaps .
