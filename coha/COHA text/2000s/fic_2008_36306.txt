Prologue <br> After bad booze in six bars , Castro 's room at the Wanderlust Motel beckoned him like the arms of a lover . At 4:00 a.m. , the Vegas Strip dazzled like a dowager 's jewels in the distance , while the flickering neon on his hotel looked like a battered sequin on the pasties of an over-the-hill showgirl . <br> He scanned the area to make sure no one was lying in wait for him . A lot of guys wanted a pound of his flesh , payback for his past acts  --  or just the chance to treat someone like a punching bag to batten down their demons . His tired glance registered Lil Joe , a jittery speed freak who some nights had the $15 to rent a room , but more often just paced the broken sidewalk outside the motel . Lil Joe glared at him and paced backwards , away from Castro 's six foot two , well-muscled frame . " Is cool . Is cool , " said Joe through cracked lips . <br> A screeching car stopped at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , followed by a scream and then a thump as the car sped away . Castro got to the spot in less than a minute . Looking at the body on the ground , he realized that being pushed from a moving car was the least of the girl 's problems . Her clothes were torn , her face pummeled , and a large pool of blood was soaking through the crotch of her jeans . <br> As he bent down to feel for a pulse in her neck , she croaked weakly , " No more , stop it . " Tears pouring down her cheek , she reached up and scratched his face with her broken nails . <br> Pinning her arm gently so she could n't reach him , he said , " I 'm not going to hurt you . " But she did n't seem to hear him through her sobs . She curled into a fetal ball as he fished his cell phone out of his pocket . He was about to dial when he heard the unmistakable metallic wallop of a round being chambered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sides and slowly straightened up , cursing himself for not considering that the driver might park the car and double back . But when he turned his head , he saw the motel manager , a tough old broad pointing a Baretta 9mm . <br> " I did n't do it , " he said . <br> He realized how bad this looked , what with the girl down and the scratches on his face . Lil Joe could alibi him , but the wiry junkie had slipped away . He pivoted slowly , keeping his hands up , cell phone pointed to the sky . He knew Ted would have handled it differently . Ted could sweet talk any woman into doing anything . The man had the gift of gab . Castro could only understand a woman after months or years in her arms . <br> His blue eyes blazed at the older woman . " Dolores , " he said , " put down the gun and let me call 911 . " He said it calmly , watching her image strobe in and out in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't lower the gun by the time he counted mentally to ten , he would pounce and break her arm . <br> Her gun went down . His fingers sped over the numbers and he gave their location to the emergency operator . As Dolores bent to soothe the scared teen , he dialed Ted . " We 've got another one , " he said . " Black Mercedes . Nevada plates , FAN 231. " <br> *** <br> By 7:00 a.m. , the man who 'd tossed her from the car was in custody . He 'd stopped for a drink after his little errand , not even bothering to clean the blood off the passenger seat . <br> Ted and Castro watched his interrogation through the one-way glass in the Vegas police department where they were the DEA end of a joint LVPD/DEA investigation into a date rape drug simply called J. The women who were slipped this beauty became sedated , then aroused , then aggressive . It pushed them further than anyone would have imagined , a sick game to the men who used it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> The driver  --  clearly not the sharpest knife in the drawer  --  claimed he was just helping out a friend at the Fantasy Resort on the Strip . " The girl was like that in the hotel room , " he told the interrogator . " Woulda been bad for business to leave her there . " <br> Through the glass , Castro could only see the back of the interrogator 's head , but he could imagine his eyes rolling at that comment . The interrogator said , " So , Joey , you 're telling me it 's good for business to throw one of the guests out of a moving car ? " <br> Joey sat up straight , as if offended by the question . " She was n't no guest . A working girl like her booking a $1000 a night room ? Get real . " <br> On the other side of the mirror , Castro thought about whether the owner of the Fantasy Resort , Frankie " the Bayonet " DiBondi , could be moving J. Why go for the piddly markup on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a million a month declared on taxes , with an unimaginable sum socked away under the radar ) and owned the hottest casino on the Strip ( $150 million annually with everyone from Bette Midler to Shakira wanting to play the 5000-seat showroom ) . <br> " Why would the Bayonet move down the alphabet to J when he could make the big bucks moving H ? " Castro said . <br> " We need still need to get on his ass , " Ted said . " Could be someone else dealing inside the Fantasy . " <br> Castro nodded . If this had occurred under DiBondi 's nose , what he did about it in the next 24 hours could tip them off to who was selling and , more importantly , who was producing the drug . <p> *** <br> When they reached the Fantasy Resort , it was barely 9:00 a.m . Castro headed straight to the casino , the surest place to find DiBondi . The 70-year-old don had a penthouse in the hotel , but was constantly in motion , greeting guests , throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables , eyeing the dealers so they did n't dick with his money . Sure , he had state-of-the-art security and a slew of ex-cops on retainer , but he was old school . <br> At the bar in the main casino , Castro caught sight of DiBondi approaching a blond-haired man in his 40s . Dressed in a navy suit with a prep school tie , the younger man stuck out in the casino , where the dress code encompassed either tuxedoed men escorting women in Cher-like beaded numbers or overweight Middle Americans in Bermuda shorts or sweat pants . <br> DiBondi put his arm around the blond man . But rather than buying him a drink , he steered the conservatively-dressed man toward the exit . Castro moved into the flow of people headed out of the sumptuous breakfast buffet so it would n't be so obvious he was trailing DiBondi . But he needed to stay close . A valet was turning over a Cadillac with the plates FAN OO1 to the older man . Castro needed to make sure he was back in his own car with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed his keys over to the guy Castro pegged to be a businessman . That term in Vegas covered a lot of territory . The DEA agent did n't know what the connection might be to J , or even if there was any . Someone producing the drug would have known better than to show up at the casino dressed like that . And DiBondi would n't have been seen in public with him . But this was going down strangely enough to make them both persons of interest . <br> *** <br> Castro 's weary body , which had n't felt sleep for nearly two days , slumped over the wheel as DiBondi and his pal pulled into a gas station outside of Flagstaff , Arizona . It was their first stop since they 'd left Vegas five hours earlier . Ted woke up as Castro eased on the brakes . " Fuck , " Ted said . " Where the hell is he taking us ? " <br> Castro did n't bother to respond . He switched positions with Ted and , once in the passenger seat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was dusk and they were across the street from the Hotel La Fonda in Taos . He stepped out of the car , took a seat in the lobby and surreptitiously snapped a photo of DiBondi 's companion on his cell phone , transmitting the image to DEA headquarters for identification . <br> He and Ted waited until the two men got in the elevator before they approached the desk themselves , checking in as a gay couple . Each of them had now gotten a good five hours sleep and were pumped for whatever DiBondi dished out . Ted took Castro 's hand as they waited for the elevator . Once inside , Castro let go and laughed . " Next time , " he said , " remind me to get assigned a woman as a partner . " <br> " Nah , you love me , " said Ted . And he was right . He was Castro 's closest friend . <br> In the room , Castro looked out the window at the flame of the setting sun and noticed that the valet had n't parked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said to Ted as he grabbed a map from the desk . " They 're just making a pit stop . " <br> They took the stairs back down . Ted disappeared into the park across from the hotel for a moment , then got into the passenger seat of the car , just as DiBondi and his buddy were pulling out . <br> Castro 's cell phone rang and he maneuvered his car onto the road , falling a safe distance behind DiBondi 's Cadillac . " He 's not in the system , " the voice on the other end said . The photo did n't match any known felons or anyone with ties to the Mob . <br> " Much obliged , " said Castro , who hung up and turned to his partner . <br> " I heard , " Ted said . <br> " Does n't seem like family either . " <br> Ninety minutes later , the Cadillac turned onto an unpaved road . <br> " Think he made us ? " Ted asked . <br> " Nah , " Castro said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Cadillac was still traveling at highway speed , churning up dust and small pebbles . The road passed along the edge of a quarry that was dug down hundreds of feet . " What 's the map say ? " <br> Ted took a pen-sized flashlight and looked at their map , shielding the light with his hand so it could n't be seen from the other car . " Quarry for about a mile along the road , then the map is pretty much blank for maybe 10 miles . " <br> " What 's it called ? Area 51 ? " <br> " Nope , nothing on it but the initials RSV . " <br> " Here , let me see . " Castro eyed the map without slowing down and the car veered sharply , bringing their right tires perilously close to the edge of the quarry . <br> " Shit , my man , " said Ted , " pay attention . DiBondi 's stopping . " <br> Castro turned left and pulled the car behind a bulldozer . Ted pressed his night vision binoculars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mystery driver had stopped about 500 feet further up the road . They were met by four men with long , black straight hair . Native Americans . <br> " RSV , " Castro said . " Reservation . " <br> They were tailing DiBondi because of his possible link to the new date rape drug . But they knew the Justice Department suspected the Mob was working its way into the Indian gaming industry and now Castro and Ted were watching a possible connection . <br> " Whatever tribe this is , it 's not doing that well , " Ted said . " Look at that wooden house . Pretty run down . " <br> Ted took his .38 out of the glove compartment . Castro already had his Sig Sauer .40 in a holster under his windbreaker . They got out of the car and walked another hundred feet , but there was n't enough cover for them to get closer . <br> Castro scrutinized the building , about 80 feet long and 20 feet wide . The arc-shaped roof had been created by bending a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to remember something from his undergraduate class on Native American History at the University of Arizona . A longhouse . The four Native Americans had gone in , but left DiBondi and his driver waiting at the door . Maybe the Indians were deciding whether to invite the men from Vegas inside . Some longhouses were a big deal , males only , peyote , and major decision making . But wait , there was something going down . Some guy had shown up on horseback and was yelling . Castro raised his night vision glasses . Guy was prepared for some sort of war dance for sure , blue stripe of paint across his nose . Chief War Paint jumped down and blocked DiBondi 's path . <br> While the Indian was focused on DiBondi , his buddy was circling to the Indian 's right , behind the horse . Castro expected the blond man to pull a gun and shoot the rider . Castro aimed his Sig Sauer at the driver 's shoulder , but this would be a tough shot . <br> Suddenly Ted crumpled to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner as he scanned the area for a sniper . Finding none , he looked at his friend , seeking out a wound . But Ted did n't seem to be bleeding anywhere other than his nose . A screechy , wheezing noise was coming from his mouth . Castro inched closer . Ted was shaking and his tongue was swollen . In the dark , Castro thought his eyes were playing tricks on him . His partner 's face was swelling , distorting into some monstrous visage . <br> " Help , " spat Ted through lips that were swelling so much they cracked . His eyelids swelled over his eyes . Blood from his nose clogged his mouth , silencing further speech . <br> Castro shoved his arms under his friend 's , scraping his knuckles raw on the stones beneath Ted . He pulled Ted 's distorted body over the gravel pathway back to the car . " Hang in there . Do n't give up on me . " <br> He lifted the man into the back seat , putting a backpack under his head so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His friend was now shaking uncontrollably . He opened his blue lips in the shape of a scream , trying to suck in air around his swollen tongue . <br> Castro careened the car back onto the road . The tires churned up stones , but their patter did n't disguise the sound of three gunshots coming from the direction of the longhouse and aimed at his speeding car . <br> <br> Alex stepped back from the gene sequencer and looked at the four-color quilt on the computer screen that represented the sequence of the glycoprotein gene of the dengue 2 virus . Call her macabre , but stripped down to its chemical bases  --  the red , blue , green , and orange representing the A , C , G , and T of the genetic code  --  the gene was quite beautiful . <br> She entered the genetic letters into a computer program and a swell of music filled the room . A professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago , Peter Gena , had created a formula for turning the genetic alphabet of deadly diseases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIV , measles , and polio as the basis for his songs . When Alex ran the program on the dengue sequence , jagged notes collided with each other , with an occasional soothing tonal switch . A chilling composition , fitting the high fatality rate of dengue fever , a Southeast Asian killer . <br> Alex , who 'd earned an M.D. and Ph.D in genetics at Columbia , had joined the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology  --  the AFIP  --  two years earlier to sequence the genomes of deadly epidemic diseases which the Department of Defense felt might be used in biowarfare against the United States . She also served on a government-wide commission led by the head of Homeland Security , Martin Kincade . The commission , populated with people from Homeland Security , the FBI , the CIA , Justice , and the National Institutes of Health , was charged with detecting emerging infections , analyzing the threat they posed , and initiating medical and social responses . <br> Her home institution , the AFIP , had more on its plate than laying in wait for possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked alongside viewed her work as marginal , rather like collecting primroses or trying to find life on other planets . They were trained to deal with immediate risks  --  targeting the enemy or capturing a killer . <br> Situated on 113 out-of-the-way acres in D.C. near the Maryland border , the semi-secret AFIP oversaw forensic investigations in the United States and abroad involving the military and the executive branch . Congress also gave it a blank check to develop new technologies for national security , forensics , and traditional warfare . The AFIP 's equivalent of James Bond 's Q  --  Captain Grant Pringle  --  oversaw a bevy of researchers just a hallway away from her . But unlike his dapper British fictional counterpart , Pringle was an over-muscled weightlifter who 'd grown up in Vegas . <br> Alex loved her work , but felt less thrilled about her workplace . She detested the military hierarchy , the baroque rules about secrecy , and the emotionless faces of many of the men she served alongside . Her natural response was to play the civilian card  --  coming to work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which research she undertook , and finding enough ways to bend the rules that they seemed like overcooked linguini when she was done with them . Her best friend and the AFIP 's lawyer , Lieutenant Barbara Findlay , was often amused and occasionally infuriated by the way Alex maneuvered through the system . Alex kidded that she was Barbara 's evil twin . <br> The music hit a particularly garish note and Alex barely heard the knock on her lab door . She opened it and admitted Captain Randolph Stone , a pathologist from Walter Reed Hospital , part of the AFIP complex . She 'd met him the previous month when she was asked to give a second opinion at the hospital . <br> " With that awful music pouring out of your lab , I felt sure you 'd be applying electricity to a body with a jagged scar across his face , " Stone said . <br> " Did you stop by to place an order ? Bride of Frankenstein for you ? " <br> " Hmm , clone of Angelina Jolie ? " <br> " Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned comfortably against a counter that held the bottles of the reagents Alex had used in this latest sequence run . He looked at Alex with the sort of glance she often got on the street from men who admired her package  --  the long curly blond hair , the curve of her jeans and turtleneck over her five foot seven frame . Most of the men at the AFIP were beyond that . They treated her like one of the guys . All except for Captain Grant Pringle , who turned leering into an Olympic-level sport . <br> This new pathologist was around her age , mid-to-late 30s , with an engaging smile and sun-bleached blond hair that , while still short , was much longer than the buzz cuts she usually encountered in the building . He handed her a folder . " I 'm here to ask you a favor . " <br> She reached for the file . " Cloned girlfriend is n't enough ? " <br> " Nah , I 'm up to my eyeballs in autopsies and I just got a call asking if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no way I can leave the building right now . " <br> Alex bristled . " Why not messenger it ? Or use one of the 800 soldiers in the building ? " It was bad enough her boss , Colonel Jack Wiatt , ordered her to do things that any lab tech could do . At least Wiatt was old enough to be her dad . But surfer guy here ? <br> " Sorry , I should explain . It 's a sensitive case . A DEA agent died yesterday in New Mexico while on the job . They 've convened an investigation  --  brought in all the big boys  --  to see if he was using on the job . They want it delivered by a physician in case there are questions . You may not have noticed , but it 's Sunday and there are n't exactly a lot of docs in the building . " <br> Alex opened the folder and paged through the report . Honestly , she thought , sometimes she flew off the handle too quickly . It would n't exactly kill her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After all , Stone was doing a huge favor for her friend , AFIP pathologist Tom Harding , who was in Australia competing in a sailboat regatta . Stone was fitting in autopsies here at AFIP while running back and forth to Walter Reed for analyses of path samples in medical cases . <br> Alex looked down at the final line of the report . Death consistent with cocaine overdose . " I do n't see any tox reports , " she said . <br> " Body just came in this morning , lab results are n't back yet . But his nasal membranes were completely eroded , just like you see with heavy users . And I found major organ failure  --  heart , kidneys . " <br> Alex nodded . It was a beautiful April day , cherry blossoms in bloom , and she had a full tank of gas in her 1963 yellow T-bird . A little excursion might be nice . " What 's the address ? " <br> " DEA Headquarters is at 700 Army Navy Drive in Arlington . " <br> Army Navy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this detour . <br> " Do you have a contact there ? " <br> He moved toward her and opened the file to the second page . " Milford . He 's the guy who requested the autopsy . Kept it out of the hands of the New Mexico medical examiner . Said the last thing DEA needed was publicity about their guy using coke on the job . " <br> Alex and Stone walked out of the lab together . " Thanks , Alex , " he said . " I owe you one .
