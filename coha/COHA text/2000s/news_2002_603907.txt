<p> This story is about sex and the campus . But no , we 're not talking about having sex . We 're talking about sex columns in college newspapers , which have been multiplying like jackrabbits . <p> From " Between the Sheets " at Tufts University near Boston to " Sex at the Beach " at California State University in Long Beach ; from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta to Oregon State University in Corvallis ; and in heartland states such as Kansas and Illinois , college students are talking about , dispensing tips and offering advice on sex , dating , sex , love , sex , relationships , sex and sex . <p> Vibrators , cross-dressing , oral sex , multiple orgasms , masturbation , bondage  --  no topic is too hot to handle . And though some say the columns are supposed to educate , others say they 're raunchy and irrelevant . Either way , the emergence of such columns puts a public face on a generation that is coming of age in a society that has grown more open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Sex and the City , whose main character , Carrie Bradshaw , writes a column on sex and relationships for a local newspaper , helped popularize the craze  --  though " Sex on Tuesday , " published by the Daily Californian at the University of California-Berkeley , premiered more than a year earlier . <p> And sex sells , as student editors have quickly learned . In the online Yale Daily News , a " Sex and the ( Elm ) City " column is said to have generated more than 250,000 hits . ( The headline : " Spit or Swallow : It 's all about the sauce . " ) At Boston College , a Catholic institution , the inaugural " Sex and the Univer-city " column logged nearly 1,000 hits on the Web version of The Heights . <p> Print copies , too , practically fly off the newsstands on the day " sexperts " appear . But the subject matter is not universally liked . <p> " Am I the only one on campus ( who is ) appalled ? " an Ohio University student complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referring to its new sex column . <p> Nope . Another Post letter-writer , referring to a column about embarrassing sounds that are made in bed ( but do n't come from the mouth ) , complained , " This is as lowbrow as it gets . " Yet another writer called the columns lacking in taste . <p> Most columns have continued to run despite controversy . <p> Administrators at Florida 's Seminole Community College near Orlando suspended publication of The Scribe because a column about birth control contained vulgarities , although the ban was lifted four days later . At McHenry County College in Crystal Lake , Ill. , a state senator last month attacked as inappropriate a new column in the Tartan called " Love Monkey . " The school paper is still running it . <p> First Amendment issues aside , defenders say the columns address an issue important to their primary readers . " It 's no secret that sex is a popular topic among college students and that , for a lot of us , it 's our first chance to explore our sexuality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston College . " It 's worth it just to get the topic out there . " <p> Professional sex educators tend to agree . Still , given that most college sexperts have no formal training in the field , some experts raise concerns about the potential for causing harm through inaccurate or inappropriate information . <p> " Generally , students can give good advice about relationships and sexuality , " says Jordan Friedman , director of health education at Columbia University , which produces a Web site ( www.goaskalice.com ) on health issues . " But they may lack the resources to do the research . " <p> Another problem , says Kathy Greaves , who teaches courses on human sexuality at Oregon State , is that some columns she has reviewed perpetuate stereotypes  --  such as that " size matters " or that men are oversexed  --  when they should be dispelling them . <p> That 's why she has been writing a sex column for The Daily Barometer since 1998 , when she was a graduate student . <p> Over the years , she says , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lousy sex education in high school . " <p> Nuggets from the campus scene <p> Thanks , but no thanks : In a news story about the sex column craze among campus newspapers , Brigham Young University 's Daily Universe says it will not offer a similar column . " Our view of sex and its role as it relates to procreation is sacred , " faculty member Jim Kelly , who oversees student media , was quoted as saying . <p> Where the boys are n't : " Sex at the Beach , " a column in the Long Beach Union at California State University at Long Beach , regularly features his-and-her viewpoints . But campus sex columnists appear to be almost exclusively women . Of 28 applicants for the position at Boston College , no more than five were male , The Heights editor Larry Griffin says . <p> Career advice from a pro : Here 's what Dan Savage , whose column " Savage Love " appears in the Village Voice and other alternative weeklies , tells those who write for career advice on how to get started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourselves . Stop bothering me . Get a real job . " <p> What they 're saying ( PG version ) : <p> * " Most of the sexually active population has mastered the act of putting on a condom , but there still seems to be confusion surrounding where to keep them , how to take them off , and even when to use them . " <p>  --  Amber Madison , " Between the Sheets , " Nov. 8 ; Tufts Daily , Tufts University <p> * " Sometimes , even if a partner is readily available for you to play around with , there 's nothing like taking matters into your own hands . . . . But what happens when your erotic adventure is stifled by an unwelcome companion , such as a roommate ? Masturbating in a group-living situation does pose some problems , but where there is a will , there is a way . " <p>  --  Meghan Bainum , Daily Kansan , Sept. 26 , University of Kansas <p> * " Women know within the first five minutes of meeting a man whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But . . . women do n't want the guy to know he 'll be hooking up until he 's actually doing it . . . . Post-hookup is when guys tend to get ambiguous . It 's their payback . Do they want to hook up again ? Du n no . Do they want to date ? Du n no . Are they straight ? Du n no . Name ? Du n no . " <p>  --  Natalie Krinsky , " Sex and the ( Elm ) City , " Nov. 1 , Yale Daily News , Yale University <p> * ( Responding to a question : ) " Women should not react to you like you are ' sexually defective ' or a ' freak , ' as many young women are now familiar with uncircumcised penises . . . . Relax and assume she will accept you for who you are and what you have . Being different does not mean being worse or less , it just means different . " <p>  --  Kathy Greaves , " Ask Doctor Sex , " Oct. 23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " College is screwed up . It 's not real life . They took 6,000 of us who are in our sexual prime and crammed us into a dorm room where there 's nowhere to sit except on the bed . Members of the opposite  --  or same , of course  --  gender are but a single flight of stairs away , and often right next door . " <p>  --  Anna Schleelein , " Sex and the Univer-City , " Oct. 29 , The Heights , Boston College <p> * " Surprise , surprise to the guys who think they 're the exception to the rule . She 's faking it . That 's right . It 's not hard . All we have to do is throw in an ' ooh ' and a couple of ' aahs , ' gyrate the hips and you guys think you 're the Jedi Master .
