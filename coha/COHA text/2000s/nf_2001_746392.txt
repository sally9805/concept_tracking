The general purpose of this study was to examine minor hockey league coaches ' and players ' perceptions of the prevalence of aggression and the aggressive behavior of the players . More specifically , there were three main purposes in the present study . The first purpose was to examine the relationship between level of play and aggression . The second purpose was lo examine the relationship between minor hockey league coaches ' and players ' perceptions of instrumental and hostile aggression , and the observed aggression on the ice . The final purpose was to explore the relationship between instrumental and hostile aggression for coaches , players , and observed aggression . Hockey players at the Atom ( i.e. , 10 to 11 yrs . ) , Peewee ( i.e. , 12 to 13 yrs. ) , and Bantam ( i.e. , 14 to 15 yrs. ) levels and their coaches completed a modified version of the Bredemeier Athletic Aggression Inventory-Short Form ( BAAGI-S ) . Observed aggression was operationally defined through penalties recorded on game sheets . Players on Atom teams were more approving of instrumental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggression and received more hostile aggression penalties . On the other hand , both Atom and Peewee/Bantam coaches endorsed instrumental aggression more than hostile aggression . Regardless of the level of play , players ' views were unrelated to coaches ' views on aggression , in addition , players viewed instrumental aggression as more acceptable , but showed a tendency to behave otherwise as reflected in more hostile-type penalties being observed . <p> As Widmeyer and Birch ( 1984 ) have noted " the world of sport , like other aspects of society , is not without aggressive behavior " ( p. 77 ) . Since ice hockey is played at high speeds in a confined space and allows for body contact , it is not surprising that it is susceptible to aggressive behaviors ( Widmeyer &; McGuire , 1997 ) . Numerous empirical studies have ; been conducted over the last 30 years on hockey violence ( Bloom &; Smith , 1996 ; Colburn , 1985 ; Cote , Trudel , Bernard , Boileau , &; Marcotte , 1993 ; Faulkner , 1974 ; Smith , 1979a , 1979b , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Marcotte , 1991 ; Widmeyer &; McGuire , 1997 ) . <p> Two kinds of aggression have been identified in the sport psychology literature : instrumental aggression and hostile aggression ( Cox , 1994 ; Cratty , 1989 ) . in both types of aggression , the intent is to harm a target person either physically and/or psychologically . Instrumental aggression serves as means to a particular goal . For example , in baseball a pitcher may throw a high inside fastball at a batter to insure he/she and subsequent batters stay well back from the plate . The injury that results is impersonal and simply designed to limit the effectiveness of the opponent ( Russell , 1993 ) . <p> On the other hand , the primary objective of hostile aggression is to inflict an injury on a target person . The intent is to make the person suffer , either physically and/or psychologically ( Cox , 1994 ) . If a baseball pitcher threw a high inside fastball at a banner simply to inflict an injury-possibly because a previous batter had hit a home run-the intent would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide insight into the factors associated with hockey violence , one general approach has been to identify the correlates of aggression . For instance , increases in aggression have been shown to be positively associated with increases in score differential ( Cote et al. , 1993 ) , increases in the frequency of competition ( Widmeyer &; McGuire , 1997 ) , and increased levels of masculinity ( Weinstein , Smith , &; Wiesenthal , 1995 ) . <p> A second approach has been to focus on what is referred to as the reference other ( Smith , 1979c ) . A person or group who directly influences an individual 's perceptions or actions is a reference other ( Morra &; Smith , 1995 ) . One of the most important reference other for young hockey players are coaches . It is suggested that perceptions of coach approval can influence athlete behavior ( Smith , 1979b ) . As a consequence , coaches play a substantial role in athletes ' views on the acceptability of behaviors including aggression . For example , Smith ( 1975 ) found the qualities a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included " being aggressive all the time " , " possessing physical size and strength " , and " having guts and courage " . Similarly , Vaz ( 1982 ) concluded that players consider technical skills and the ability to be continually aggressive as fundamental qualities that coaches consider essential to the game of hockey . <p> Luxbacher ( 1986 ) found that coach 's attitudes are related to the amount of aggression shown by soccer players . Specifically , players who perceived their coach to have a win-at-all-costs altitude expressed significantly higher levels of aggression , were more inclined to use illegal tactics , and displayed a more professional attitude towards competition . <p> Although a large body of research has been generated from a reference other perspective , individual behavior is not solely a product of situational exigencies . Thus , aggression should also be examined directly from both a coach 's and a player 's viewpoint . Also , while two types of aggression are theoretically present in sport ( i.e. , hostile and instrumental ) , little empirical research has examined the prevalence of these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study was undertaken to determine if coaches and players are similar in their perceptions of aggression , and if these perceptions are related to players ' behavior on the playing surface . <p> The first of three main purposes was to examine the influence of level of play ( i.e. , reflected in increasing age and experience in hockey ) on hostile and instrumental aggression of players and coaches . Research examining the relationship between level of play and measures of aggression such as fighting ( Bloom &; Smith , 1996 ) and total penalty minutes ( Weinstein el al. , 1995 ) have shown that as level of play increases ( i.e. , older players ) acts of aggression also increase . Therefore , it was predicted that as age and experience increased ( i.e. , from Atom to Peewee to Bantam ) , approval of and engagement in hostile and instrumental aggression would also increase for both players and coaches . <p> The second main purpose was to examine the relationships between coaches ' and players ' perceptions toward hostile and instrumental aggression and observed aggression . Research by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1996 ) have shown soccer players ' attitudes toward aggression are related to those of their coach . Little empirical research examining this relationship in a hockey context has been conducted . Consequently , a positive relationship was predicted for the present study . <p> The final purpose was to explore the relationships between perceptions of ( i.e. , approval of ) instrumental and hostile aggression in coaches and players , and the observed aggressive behavior of players . Given the general nature of previous research , a positive relationship between the perceptions of both players and coaches and the observed hostile and instrumental aggression of athletes was predicted . <p> A number of authors have pointed out that social phenomena can be examined at different levels-the individual group-member level , the aggregated group level , or the intact group level ( e.g. , Cota , Longman , Evans , &; Dion , 1995 ; Paskevich , 1995 ) . As Carton and Spink ( 1995 ) pointed out , the most appropriate level " depends upon the nature of the question " ( p. 91 ) . The fundamental question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cf. Smith , 1979c ) - operationally defined as coaches in the present study-plays an important role in influencing the attitudes and behaviors of a target group-operationally defined as the players on their team . In short , the research question represented a group-level question and an aggregated group level approach was used in the analyses-the scores of individual players on a team were combined to reflect a " team perspective " . Method <p> Participants <p> Questionnaires were distributed to 30 competitive level minor male hockey teams at the Atom ( 10-11years old ) , Peewee ( 12-13years old ) , and Bantam ( 14-15years old ) levels . One major subdivision in minor hockey is house league versus competitive . The competitive level was targeted in the present study for two reasons . First , body checking is not permitted at any age in the house league system ; a restriction that is not present in competitive hockey at Atom , Peewee , and Bantam . Second , the primary focus in house league is mass participation ; in competitive hockey , players compete for positions on a team as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained from 30 head coaches ( range in age of 29-52 years , M = 42 yrs. , SD = 6.8 ) , and 171 athletes ( a rate of return of 38% ) . It was intended initially to statistically consider the three levels of experience ( i.e. , Atom , Peewee , and Bantam ) as independent factors . However , given a relatively reduced number of responses at the Peewee and Bantam levels , a decision was made to group these two together . This produced 15 teams ( a total of 74 athletes ) at the Atom level and 15 teams at the Peewee and Bantam level ( a total of 97 athletes ) . <p> Measures <p> Perceived aggression . An adapted version of the Bredemeier Athletic Aggression Inventory-Short Form ( BAAGI-S ) was used to assess perceived aggression for both coaches and players . The BAAGI-S distinguishes between two types of aggression : hostile ( has the goal of inflicting injury on another person ) and instrumental ( has the goal of achieving a particular outcome such as winning , money , prestige , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each of hostile and instrumental ) . Responses are provided on a 4-point Likert scale containing the prompts strong agreement ( 1 ) , agreement ( 2 ) , disagreement ( 3 ) , or strong disagreement ( 4 ) . Thus , higher scores indicate lower levels of aggression . <p> The BAAGI-S has been administered primarily to older elite level athletes . Consequently , an adapted version of the BAAGI-S was required for both minor hockey coaches and players . A panel of three minor hockey coaches and a linguistics expert made the modifications to the BAAGI-S . For example , a typical question in the original version is " I am usually calm and poised before participating in an athletic event " . When revised for the coach 's version , the question became : " I am usually calm and poised before coaching an athletic event . " When the same original question was revised for minor hockey players , it read : " i am usually relaxed before a game " . <p> Observed aggression . A measure of actual aggressive behavior was obtained using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awarded by the referee are specifically listed ) . A typology advanced by McCarthy and Kelly 's ( 1978 ) was used to categorize penalties as either hostile or instrumental in nature . Hostile aggressive penalties included elbowing , slashing , boarding , roughing , cross-checking , high-sticking , butt-ending , fighting , spearing , kneeing , checking from behind , charging , and face masking . Instrumental aggressive penalties included tripping , hooking , holding , and interference . Penalties considered neither instrumental nor hostile ( and , therefore , not used in the analyses ) included delay of game , too many men on the ice , bench penalty , playing with a broken stick , and unsporling conduct . <p> Within the rules of hockey , the punishment ( in terms of time spent in the penalty box ) for different infractions varies from two minutes to five and ten minutes . As a consequence , total penalty minutes would represent an inappropriate ( i.e. misleading ) dependent variable ( McCarthy &; Kelly , 1978 ) . Therefore , using the approach of McCarthy and Kelly ( 1978 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two categories ( hostile , instrumental ) was used . <p> Since referees are rotated randomly through the various leagues and age levels , it was assumed that errors in observation and interpretation were distributed evenly for all teams ( Widmeyer &; McGuire , 1997 ) . In fact , Audette , Trudel , and Bernard ( 1994 ) reported that the change in the number of different types of penalties assessed by National Hockey League ( NHL ) referees from the 1978 season until the end of the 1988 season remained unchanged , in addition , Katorji and Cahoon ( 1992 ) found that only 4.8% of aggressive acts seen by two independent observers went unnoticed by referees in Junior B hockey games . Therefore , it was assumed that the fact that some aggressive acts go unnoticed would have only a minor impact on the examination of aggressive behavior as assessed through the number of penalties ( Widmeyer &; McGuire , 1997 ) . <p> Procedure <p> Hockey teams were contacted near the end of their competitive season to obtain permission to test the players and coaches , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistants met with the participating teams . Coaches completed the questionnaire on-site and submitted their game summary sheets . Each player received a package to take home . It included a questionnaire , a parent consent form , an athlete assent form and a stamped envelope with the senior researcher 's address printed on the front of the envelope . Players were instructed to complete their questionnaires independently and return them to the researcher . All participants were assured that their participation was voluntary and that responses would be kept confidential . Results and Discussion <p> Level of Play and Aggression <p> Descriptive statistics for the variables of interest are presented in Table 1 for the total sample and in Table 2 for the subsamples divided on the basis of level of play . Prior to testing the specific predictions , a one-way MANOVA was computed using the 6 manifestations of aggression as dependent variables ( coach 's perception of instrumental and hostile aggression , player 's perception of instrumental and hostile and aggression , and player 's observed instrumental and hostile aggression ) . As indicated above , the player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases was 30 . The results from the MANOVA showed a significant effect for aggression ( F(6,24) = 3070.04 , p &lt; .05 ) . <p> To determine if there were differences in aggression on the basis of level of play , independent t tests were conducted on each of the aggression types . Since multiple tests were computed , a criterion level of .05 with Bonferroni correction was used . The Bonferroni correction controls the overall error rate by setting the error rate for each test to the experimentwise error rate divided by the total number of tests . Hence , the observed significance level is adjusted for the fact that multiple comparisons are made ( Cone &; Foster , 1993 ) . <p> The results showed that the Atom and Peewee/Bantam teams differed in observed hostile ( t(28) = - 4.76 , p &lt; .008 ) and instrumental aggression ( t(28) = - 3.14 , p &lt; .008 ) . Peewee/Bantam players received more penalties , both instrumental and hostile , than their Atom counterparts . For players ' perceived aggression , a statistically significant difference was present for both hostile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrumental aggression ( t(28) = - 4.80 , p &lt; .008 ) in relation to level of play . In terms of hostile aggression , the older Peewee/Bantam players were more approving than Atom players . On the other hand , Atom players ' were more approving of instrumental aggression than Peewee/Bantam players . However , no differences were present between Atom and Peewee/Bantam coaches ' in either perceived hostile aggression ( t(28) = - .98 , p = ns ) or perceived instrumental aggression ( t(28) = .65 , p = ns ) . <p> Congruent with previous research and the predictions , both perceived and observed aggression in players increased with advancing levels of play . The Peewee/Bantam players viewed hostile aggression as more acceptable than the younger Atom players . However , the finding of higher approval for perceived instrumental aggression at the Atom level was unexpected . As players proceed through minor hockey , they realize what is required to become upwardly mobile . Players quickly learn what is required for them to continue in hockey ( Smith , 1979b ) . At the Atom level , the focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this level are learning the fundamentals of the game . it would appear that Atom players use instrumental aggression more than Peewee/Bantam players to compensate for their lack of skill . Nonetheless , as players ' progress through minor hockey , they quickly learn what it takes to advance through the minor hockey system ( Smith , 1979b ) . if young athletes are to succeed in hockey , they are expected to demonstrate potential no later than Peewee or Bantam. it is at this level that the criteria for player evaluation changes ( Vaz , 1976 ) . Players are expected to be continuously aggressive , and a greater emphasis is placed on winning . <p> As level of play increased , higher amounts of approval of hostile and instrumental aggression from the coaches were predicted . However , regardless of level of play , coaches tend to exhibit the same levels of perceived aggression for both hostile and instrumental aggression types . Nearly 75% of minor hockey coaches are former players ( Spallanzani , 1988 ) , and have progressed through a minor hockey league system characterized by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1979a ) . As former minor hockey league players , coaches bring the occupational standard with them , and begin looking for players who can withstand and produce illegal physical coercion ( Smith , 1979b , 1979c ) . <p> Hostile and Instrumental Aggression for Coaches , Players , and Observed Aggression <p> Intercorrelations among the variables are presented in Table 3 . As these results show , players ' perceived hostile aggression and observed hostile aggression were positively related ( r = .56 , p &lt; .003 ) . Neither the relationship between coaches ' and players perceived hostile aggression ( r = - .19 , p = ns ) nor coaches ' perceived and players observed hostile aggression ( r = - .14 , p = ns ) was statistically significant . <p> Players ' perceived instrumental aggression and observed instrumental aggression were negatively related ( r = - .69 , p &lt; .003 ) . However , no significant relationship was present for the perceived instrumental aggression scores of coaches and players ( r = - .15 , p = ns ) . Similarly , the relationship between coaches ' instrumental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( r = - .16 , p = ns ) . <p> A positive relationship among coach perceived , player perceived , and player observed hostile and instrumental aggression was predicted . The results revealed that only players ' perceived and observed aggression were significantly correlated for both instrumental and hostile aggression . For hostile aggression , the more players approved of hostile aggression , the more hostile type penalties they received . This result may not be surprising . Smith ( 1979a ) found that hockey players who fought more and received more major penalties displayed a more proviolence value-attitude pattern than nonviolent players and nonplayers . Smith interpreted his results as supportive of a violent subculture hypothesis in hockey ( i.e. , violent individuals put significantly greater importance than nonviolent individuals on values and attitudes supportive of violence ) . <p> Interestingly , a contrary pattern of results was obtained for instrumental aggression . That is , players who indicated lesser amounts of approval for instrumental aggression received more instrumental type penalties . This is best explained by what is known as the instrumental orientation of players ( Colburn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Smith ( 1979a ) , demonstrated that illegal infractions in hockey sometimes reflect an occupationally directed and controlled method of achieving an approved end ( e.g. , winning the game , career advancement ) . As Colburn ( 1985 ) noted , violence in hockey can be referred to as instrumental for the reason that it is engaged in by a player not as an end in itself , but rather as a means to the realization of some other end . Furthermore , Colburn suggested that players engage in such activity because " what is at stake in their conduct are such social goods as self-esteem , honor and respect which are intrinsically , if not extrinsically , rewarding and valuable " ( p. 154 ) . As a result , players do not perceive instrumental behaviors as aggressive since this type of aggression is associated with values that are socially desirable . <p> It was also predicted that players ' endorsement of aggression would be related to that of their coach . The results did not support this hypothesis . This result was unexpected since previous findings have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ego orientation was a predictor of the likelihood to aggress ( Stephens &; Bredemeier , 1996 ) . <p> Finally , it was predicted that coaches ' perceived aggression would be associated with player observed aggression . Again , the results did not support this hypothesis . The results reflect the fact that coaches-although highly influential  --  are only one of many influences on players ' perceptions and behaviors of aggression . Besides coaches , Smith ( 1979c ) and Morra and Smith ( 1995 ) found that parents , teammates , spectators , and the media help perpetuate that aggression and violence are acceptable and necessary elements of the game of hockey . <p> Differences Between Manifestations of Aggression <p> A number of paired t tests were conducted to examine for differences in instrumental versus hostile aggression insofar as coaches ' perceptions , players ' perceptions ' , and players ' behavior is concerned . Results showed that coaches ( t(29) = 11.50 , p &lt; .017 ) and players ( t(29) = 4.30 , p &lt; .017 ) showed greater approval for instrumental aggression . However , players displayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8.10 , p &lt; .017 ) . <p> The results provide support for the suggestion that minor hockey league coaches and players are less inclined to endorse aggression for its own sake than as a means to an end . It is possible that there is an overemphasis placed on winning within the culture of competitive hockey . As a player progresses through the minor hockey system , the value of success , ( i.e. , winning ) , takes precedence ( Vaz , 1976 ) . It could be argued that players do not view some of their perceptions as instrumental aggression since it is associated with values that are socially desirable ( i.e. , respect , honor ) ( Colburn , 1985 ) . <p> It seems likely that coaches show greater approval for instrumental aggression because they have learned that it is advantageous to do so ( Bandura , 1973 ) . Smith ( 1979b ) noted that hockey coaches encourage the use of aggressive play for what it symbolizes ( character development ) , and for its utility in winning hockey games , in addition , Trudel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hockey coaches approved of penalties if they helped prevent goals . The results from Smith ( 1979b ) and Trudel et al . ( 1992 ) could be considered forms of instrumental aggression , as they are perceived to be necessary elements in winning hockey games . <p> Although coaches and players indicated a higher approval for instrumental aggression , the observed on-ice behavior told a different story . There were almost twice as many hostile penalties received as instrumental penalties . This result is difficult to explain , since players were less approving of hostile aggression . It would appear that a player 's perception is one thing , but what actually occurs on the ice is another . It would appear that for many young hockey players , the importance of earning the respect of fellow players is crucial ( Colburn , 1985 ; Faulkner , 1974 ; Smith , 1979b ; Vaz , 1976 ) . Courage , toughness , and a willingness to fight are examples of ways in which players earn respect . Respect is lost if a player backs down , shows lack of heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( Morra &; Smith , 1995 ) . Players who show a reputation for being tough , regardless of how they feel about aggression , are the ones who demonstrate the characteristics that the game of hockey reinforces . <p> The results of the present study provide support for the suggestion that minor hockey league coaches , regardless of level of play , are similar in their perceptions towards both types of aggression . Furthermore , as players advance through the minor hockey system , they develop a more approving perception towards hostile aggression , which in turn leads to more hostile types of penalties . Finally , both coaches and players viewed instrumental aggression as a more acceptable behavior than hostile aggression . However , the behavior on the ice is far different with players receiving more hostile aggression penalties than instrumental aggression penalties . It would be fruitful to examine higher levels of hockey ( i.e. , junior and professional ranks ) to determine if players and coaches at these levels display similar perceptions and behaviors towards instrumental and hostile aggression . If the results of the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players and coaches in senior levels of play would endorse both instrumental and hostile aggression more than their younger , less experience counterparts . <p> Future research should attempt to determine the impact of leagues where specific rules pertaining to fair play have been implemented . For example , teams receive points based not only on the outcome of the game but also on their behavior . Each team begins the game with six behavior points , and each minor and major penalty results in the loss of one point until the team exceeds the limit determined by league administrators ( Gilbert , Trudel , &; Bloom , 1995 ) . It could be argued that fewer penalties , both instrumental and hostile , would be observed in fair play leagues , and coaches ' and players ' perceptions towards aggression would differ from those in the more traditional leagues . <p> Finally , future research is required to determine the contrast between players positive perception towards instrumental aggression while engaging in more hostile type of behaviors on the playing surface . One approach would be to conduct in-depth interviews with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could be argued that players had instrumental aggression intentions however received a hostile penalty as called by the referee . <p> This research was funded by the Canadian Hockey Centre of Excellence - Young Investigator 's Program awarded to the first author .
