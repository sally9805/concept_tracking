<p> SO you stood for hours in the predawn chill at Mr. Megastore and still could n't get the Xbox 360 little Rufus so desperately wants for Christmas ? Be grateful America 's publishers , at least , know how to meet demand . Right now dozens of terrific books sit on store shelves waiting to be snapped up . And wrapped up . <p> Here are suggestions you may find useful as you shop for book lovers on your list . We start with recent nonfiction and fiction , books people are talking about . Then we take up those oversize coffeetable tomes , the kind that demonstrate the sheer weight of your regard . We conclude with a pair of off beat ideas for the subversively minded . <p> Nonfiction <p> Good nonfiction titles outnumbered good fiction this season . As always , you ca n't escape the presidents . <p> Plagiarism charges nicked Doris Kearns Goodwin 's reputation but have n't kept fans from embracing her latest , Team of Rivals : The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln ( Simon &; Schuster , 944 pp. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln 's shrewdness in harnessing for his Cabinet talented political rivals such as Edwin Stanton and William Seward . <p> Two other presidential studies of note : H.W. Brands ' Andrew Jackson ( Doubleday , 620 pp. $35 ) , an evenhanded life of Old Hickory , and Candice Millard 's River of Doubt : Theodore Roosevelt 's Darkest Journey ( Doubleday , 416 pp. $26 ) , about a near-fatal South American river trip during which flesh-eating bacteria gnawed on the ex-president . <p> The war in Iraq has spawned a shelfload of books . George Packer 's The Assassins ' Gate ( Farrar , Straus &; Giroux , 467 pp. $26 ) is one of the meatiest . Packer , a writer for the New Yorker , begins with the rise to power and influence of " neocons " such as Paul Wolfowitz , who provided the intellectual justifications for regime change in Iraq , then moves on to firstrate reportage of the war 's aftermath . Packer , a self-described liberal , supported the invasion but remains seriously ambivalent about how the occupation has unfolded . <p> Readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1945 by Tony Judt ( Penguin Press , 878 pp. $39.95 ) with a plodding textbook . Immensely erudite , with a knack for clean , lucid expression , Judt glides from politics to culture to economics . Even people who lived through these decades and think they remember them will come away enlightened . <p> What would the holidays be without more books about World War II ? Richard J. Evans ' The Third Reich in Power : 1933-1939 ( Penguin Press , 960 pp. $37.95 ) , the second in his planned trilogy of the Nazi regime , delivers no radically new interpretations but is deeply researched and extremely readable . Volume 1 , The Coming of the Third Reich , has just been issued in paperback ( Penguin , $18 ) . Reviewers have raved about both . <p> Joan Didion 's taut , heartbreaking Year of Magical Thinking ( Knopf , 227 pp. $23.95 ) is the most-talked-about memoir of the season . Two years ago this month Didion 's husband of four decades , the novelist John Gregory Dunne , keeled over his supper plate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple 's 39-yearold daughter , suffering from pneumonia and septic shock , lay near death at a nearby hospital . Didion anatomizes her grief with ruthless candor . <p> Among the improbable successes in modern publishing , few rival the story of Frank Mc- Court and Angela 's Ashes , his seriocomic memoir of a miserable , impoverished Irish childhood . ' T is , about McCourt 's years as a young man new in America , followed . Now comes Teacher Man ( Scribner , 258 pp. $26 ) , about his experiences as a public- school teacher in New York and his first steps as a writer . <p> In Angela 's Ashes , booze produces all manner of misery . The corner pub plays a more benign role in journalist J.R . Moehringer 's memoir The Tender Bar ( Hyperion , 384 pp. $23.95 ) , in which a lonely kid growing up on Long Island finds surrogate fathers among the regulars at Dickens bar . <p> Julie Powell ate rather than drank her way to a writing career . Julie and Julia : 365 Days , 524 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 320 pp. $23.95 ) describes her all-consuming quest to cook every recipe in Julia Child 's Mastering the Art of French Cooking . The result is a tasty souffl of a book . <p> The dean of African-American historians , 90-year-old John Hope Franklin , reflects on the civil rights movement and his own role as a public intellectual in his autobiography Mirror to America ( Farrar , Straus &; Giroux , 401 pp. $25 ) . <p> Standout biographies of the season include Jung Chang and Jon Halliday 's Mao : The Unknown Story ( Knopf , 832 pp. $35 ) , a book one reviewer called " more indictment than portrait , " and American Prometheus : The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer ( Knopf , 736 pp. $35 ) by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin , in which the father of the Bomb emerges as a tragic figure . <p> In The Beatles ( Little , Brown , 992 pp. $29.95 ) veteran music writer Bob Spitz recalls the Fab Four in exhaustive detail - a perfect gift for the aging baby boomer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You Die ( Barron 's , 960 pp. $35 ) is terrifically useful . You can reacquaint yourself with old favorites you have n't seen for years and remind yourself of what to pick up for home viewing . Editor Steven Jay Schneider and his team deliver succinct plot summaries and smart comment . That 's not to say you wo n't argue with them . ( I , for one , do n't need to see Saturday Night Fever before I die . ) The book 's only drawback : no info on whether films are available on tape or DVD . <p> Jonathan Harr 's The Lost Painting : The Search for a Caravaggio Masterpiece ( Random House , 288 pp. $24.95 ) should appeal both to art lovers and those who savor a good mystery . For stargazers on your list consider Dava Sobel 's The Planets ( Viking , 288 pp. $24.95 ) , a collection of ruminative essays inspired by our solar system . <p> A best-seller - and deservedly so - when first published in 2003 , Bill Bryson 's A Short History of Nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( Broadway , 624 pp. $35 ) . " Nearly Everything " here begins with the Big Bang and concludes with the rise of Homo sapiens , taking sidetrips into such topics as volcanoes , the ocean , the peculiar chemistry of the earth 's atmosphere . The result is readily digestible " science for dummies . " Bryson writes engagingly , leavening explanation with excellent anecdotes ( The poet Paul Valery asked Einstein if he kept a notebook to record his ideas . Einstein replied , " Oh , that 's not necessary . It 's so seldom I have one . " ) . But do n't kid yourself . After finishing Bryson you still wo n't understand string theory . <p> Here 's another possibility for those with dreams of selfimprovement : Peter Watson 's Ideas : A History of Thought and Invention , From Fire to Freud ( HarperCollins , 822 pp. $29.95 ) . Watson discusses , for example , not the actual conquest of America but " the thinking that led to the discovery of the New World and the ways in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . " The rise of science , of the factory system , of the idea of Europe , of the scholar-elite in China - it 's all here , intellectual history on a grand and gaudy scale . <p> The Colosseum by Keith Hopkins and Mary Beard ( 214 pp. $19.95 ) is the latest in Harvard University Press ' nifty Wonders of the World series for armchair travelers . These handsome little books chronicle history and lore surrounding great monuments . Previous volumes have been devoted to the Alhambra and Westminster Abbey , for example . Hopkins and Beard inform us we know of no Christian martyr who ever met his fate in ancient Rome 's most popular entertainment venue . <p> Though written for young people , E.H . Gombrich 's A Little History of the World ( Yale University Press , 284 pp. $25 ) can be enjoyed by the curious of all ages . Gombrich , who died in 2001 , was a German-born art historian , among the most distinguished of his generation ( his Story of Art has sold 6 million copies ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1935 he accepted a publisher 's invitation to write a world history for younger readers . He completed the task in six weeks . Published in Germany to immediate success , the book has n't appeared in English until now . Although Gombrich 's conception of " world " history mostly means European history , he writes with verve and infectious good humor . Yale packages Gombrich 's words attractively with woodcutlike illustrations by Clifford Harper . <p> Finally , Penguin Press has reissued in an illustrated edition The Elements of Style ( 157 pp. $24.95 ) , the classic list of dos and don'ts for writers by William Strunk Jr . and E.B. White . Maira Kalman 's paintings are colorful , funny and weirdly imaginative . ( See , for example , how she illustrates the command not to dress up words by adding - ly to them . ) <p> Fiction <p> When shopping for fiction , consider On Beauty ( Penguin Press , 446 pp. $25.95 ) , Zadie Smith 's updating of E.M . Forster 's Howard 's End . Smith adds modern complexities of race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mixedrace son of a white left-wing American academic falling for the daughter of a black rightwing academic from Trinidad . Of course , complications ensue . <p> E.L . Doctorow 's The March ( Random House , 384 pp. $25.95 ) is a fictional retelling of William Sherman 's march through Georgia and the Carolinas during the Civil War . A large and varied cast enlivens this readable historical novel . <p> In Mary Gaitskill 's Veronica ( Pantheon , 227 pp. $23 ) , an aging ex-model revisits her sad life of sex and drugs . It might be just the thing to convince your daughter to get a real job and a serious boyfriend . <p> Likewise compelling but less than cheery is Cormac McCarthy 's No Country for Old Men ( Knopf , 320 pp. $24.95 ) . Set in contemporary West Texas , this novel , about an ordinary Joe who stumbles across a drug deal gone bad , lacks the thematic and linguistic density of McCarthy 's best work . On the other hand , it 's a lot easier to read . <p> Gabriel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Knopf , 128 pp. $20 ) , is n't his greatest work , but fans may appreciate this novella , narrated by a 90-yearold Lothario who falls for a hooker in her early teens . ( Note : Do not give to anyone who recently married a much younger woman . ) <p> For more ambitious fare consider William Vollmann 's National Book Award-winning Europe Central ( Viking , 832 pp. $39.95 ) , a big-cast epic about World War II that dives into the heads of both Germans and Russians on the eastern front . <p> The Better of McSweeney 's , Volume 1 , edited by Dave Eggers and Eli Horowitz ( McSweeney 's , 420 pp. $18 paperback ) collects the best ( OK , better ) stories published in the first 10 issues of the hip literary quarterly . In this good sampling of work by young writers , look for stories by Jonathan Lethem , A.M. Homes , David Foster Wallace and George Saunders . <p> Among literary classics packaged in gift editions this year is John Milton 's Paradise Lost ( Oxford , 374 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1688 . In his introduction , noted young-adult author Philip Pullman tries to sell Milton 's epic to contemporary readers . See also the 60thanniversary edition of Richard Wright 's Black Boy ( Harper-Collins , 419 pp. $24.95 ) , a controversial and groundbreaking book when published in 1945 and one of the great comingof- age stories in American literature . <p> Coffee-table books <p> Now for coffee-table books . Gift-givers feeling flush might consider the following fat , colorful and , yes , pricey titles . <p> Weighing in at 561 pages and more than 10 pounds is the superb Oxford Atlas of the World : Deluxe Edition ( Oxford University Press , $150 ) , which marries traditional physical maps with thematic maps on subjects like global trade , climate change and health . The latter are full of useful or simply curious lore - a diagram of the difference between La Nia and El Nio , a graph showing that compared to the United States , Italy has more than twice as many doctors per 100,000 population ( 607 to 279 ) . The physical maps give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names . The digital revolution has made it far easier to update maps ( it 's been 10 years since a cartographer has drawn one by hand , according to the atlas 's editor ) . Oxford revises this atlas every year , so the 2005 edition ( which comes in a slipcase ) is as current as these things get . <p> Of the countless new movierelated books out there The Stanley Kubrick Archives ( Taschen , 544 pp. $200 ) must be the most sumptuous ( for that price , you say , it should be ) . The first half of this massive volume consists of 800 stills from Kubrick 's 12 movies , from the journeymanlike Killer 's Kiss of 1955 to 1999 's Eyes Wide Shut , the film he was completing when he died . These are moderately interesting but do n't justify the $200 tariff . The real heart of the book lies in what follows - essays , photos , screenplay drafts and the like that document Kubrick 's creative process on each film . Interviews serve to humanize the famously reclusive director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how , post-Kubrick , we live in an age of cinematic pygmies . <p> For the bookish the year 's most coveted gift may not be a book at all but rather The Complete New Yorker on eight DVDs ( Random House , $100 ) . " Complete " here means complete - all 4,109 issues from the magazine 's founding in 1925 through 2005 , every page , every cartoon , every ad . What you see on your screen is the page as it appeared in the magazine . Read on the screen or , with a couple of clicks , make a printout . <p> To have practical value , this massive digitized assemblage has to be searchable , and it is , though you need to understand what that means . As New Yorker editor David Remnick writes in the " Highlights " book that comes with the set , staff librarians index everything in each issue based on " main " topics as well as " mentions " of people , places , organizations , etc . " Some articles generate dozens of reference cards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make up the search-term database . They should be all you need if you 're interested in reading , say , all the articles dealing with Guantanamo Bay or everything John Updike has published in the magazine . Even so general a pair of search terms as " food " and " 2004 " pulled up 145 items ( cartoons and fiction as well as articles ) . <p> Do note the system requirements listed on the back . A relatively new computer is required . <p> Retailing for $150 , the threevolume slipcased Complete Calvin and Hobbes by Bill Watterson ( Andrews McMeel , 1,440 pp. ) is the most expensive book ever to make the New York Times best-seller list , according to my colleague Eric Harrison . All 3,160 strips that appeared in the comic strip 's 10-year life are there for savoring . <p> Last fall Norton published The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes , a two-volume slipcased edition of the short stories , edited by Leslie S. Klinger . Now comes the companion slipcased volume , which brings together the four novels ( A Study in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Baskervilles and The Valley of Fear ) . This stout book ( 907 pp. , $49.95 ) is probably not the edition to read in bed , but the devoted Sherlockian will covet it . The annotations , so extensive as to constitute a counternarrative , cover topics ranging from the layout of Holmes ' house to the accomplishments of Joseph Swan , the Englishman who beat Thomas Edison in inventing the light bulb . <p> " Then and Now " photography books are always fun . For Texas Then and Now ( Westcliffe Publishers , 156 pp. $45 ) Austin-based photographer Richard Reynolds scoured public and private archives to find photos from the 19th and early 20th centuries , then rephotographed the scene from the same spot . The resulting pairs of pictures capture the range of transformation in the state , from big change ( Houston 's skyline ) to little ( downtown Bandera ai n't changed much in 50 years ) . <p> For the military-history buff on your list there 's R.G. Grant 's Battle : A Visual Journey Through 5,000 Years of Combat ( DK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in History edited by Jeremy Black ( Thames &; Hudson , 304 pp. $40 ) . DK has a well-earned reputation for colorful , well-designed books short on text and heavy on art . Battle is no exception . Seventy Great Battles comprises short essays , complemented by plenty of artwork . The coverage is global , including not only familiar battles like Waterloo and Stalingrad but lesser-known dustups like the 1600 Battle of Sekigahara , which paved the way for the 250-year Tokugawa Shogunate in Japan . <p> Frank Lloyd Wright has been dead almost half a century , but I 'm betting he 's still the only architect most Americans can name . Books devoted to his work keep coming , the latest being a particularly welcome contribution , Frank Lloyd Wright : The Houses with principal text by Alan Hess and photographs by Alan Weintraub ( Rizzoli , 480 pp. $75 ) . More than 500 color and black-and-white photographs document 100 Wright houses , inside and out . Compared to the pompous brick squats rich folks insist on today , Wright 's houses look especially graceful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown 's Lawrence of Arabia : The Life , the Legend ( Thames &; Hudson , 208 pp. $45 ) . Most of those photos document Lawrence 's involvement in the Arab Revolt during World War I , but there are side trips through Lawrence 's early life and brief postwar career . Snippets from Seven Pillars of Wisdom , Lawrence 's classic account of his adventures , complement the exotic images . <p> The artwork depicted in The Impressionists at Home ( Thames &; Hudson , 176 pp. $35 ) is only part of the book 's appeal . Art historian Pamela Todd 's text , organized around artists ' daily routines - eating , socializing , working , bathing , sleeping - is equally interesting and informative . Here 's a reasonably priced coffee-table book that can be read with pleasure . <p> Offbeat options <p> Finally , for a quirky book gift consider either Crap Cars by British automotive writer Richard Porter ( Bloomsbury , 111 pp. $14.95 ) or PostSecret : Extraordinary Confessions From Ordinary Lives by Frank Warren ( ReganBooks , 278 pp. $24.95 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a compendium of the 50 worst piles the automotive industry has inflicted on the public from the 1960s through the ' 90s . Porter combines a photograph of the offending auto with brief but acerbic commentary . Here he is on the beloved MGB sports car : " For some baffling reason , the MGB is the darling of the classic British sports car scene . Which is odd , because it 's also quite spectacular garbage . For one thing , it 's based on the chassis of the Austin Cambridge , a 1950s sedan that used technology so old-fashioned it gets several mentions in the Bible . Secondly , the MGB was n't the only thing to be built around the Cambridge chassis , because it was also the basis for the Leyland Sherpa . Which is a cargo van . So an MGB is essentially a leakier , noisier , less comfortable and far less useful version of something once used to deliver tractor parts . " <p> A year ago Frank Warren , a Maryland businessman fascinated by postcards , hit upon an art project . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are invited to anonymously contribute a secret to a group art project . Your secret can be regret , fear , betrayal , desire , confession or childhood humiliation . Reveal anything - as long as it is true and you have never shared it with anyone before . " <p> He handed these out in subways , left them in art galleries , and so on . Responses , which Warren posted on his Web site , flooded in ( to date he 's received more than 10,000 hand-drawn cards ) . PostSecret the book represents a sampling . <p> A few are funny . Most are either heartbreaking , strangely disconcerting or both . Sex and romance , not surprisingly , evoke lots of soul-baring . " I 'm 25 , " says one , " and have never been kissed . It 's not that I do n't want to . . . it 's just that no one else does . " <p> Parent-child relations prompt many revelations : " I feel guilty about sometimes wishing that I did n't have children , " goes one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fear I might trigger something bad happening to them . " <p> Peruse this book and be reminded of the mysteries that lie behind the bland faces you see in the grocery store . <p> NOTES : fritz.lanham@chron.com
