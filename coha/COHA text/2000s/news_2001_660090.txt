<p> Four years ago , after having " had about every job you can do without a college degree , " Nicole Cucinotta decided that more than anything else , she wanted to teach . Before she could take charge of an elementary school classroom , though , she knew she 'd have to go back to class herself . When she enrolled in Camden County College near Philadelphia , Mrs. Cucinotta did n't expect to like it . " I thought I was going to have to shove myself through , " she says . But now she 's become addicted to studying , and works hard to juggle the demands of marriage , a job , school , and motherhood . The United States Department of Education projects that some 6.2 million people over age 25 will enroll in colleges and universities this year , up from 5.9 million in 1998 . The majority of them ( 4.5 million ) will attend part time . Adults returning to school face myriad challenges , from raising money for tuition to finding suitable child care and making time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who takes the plunge has to tailor an approach that fits his or her priorities . It may be an intensive , full-time study blitz or a long stretch of multitasking . But either way , the experience often means a mix of sacrifices and unexpected rewards . When she first returned to school , Cucinotta 's goals were to continue to earn money and spend meaningful time with her husband , Dean . So she chose a flexible program at a local community college - no lengthy commute , no high tuition . She alternates classroom work with online courses and the occasional self-paced videotaped course . When she worked full time , she limited herself to two classes a term . After taking time off when her daughter , Gianna , was born last April , she eased back into academics . " The class I 'm taking now is noncredit , " she says , " because I did n't know how I was going to manage my time . " Cucinotta gets up at 7 a.m. to do housework and pay bills while Gianna sleeps ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hits the books . She also works two evenings a week in a restaurant while Dean cares for Gianna , and spends two afternoons teaching arts and crafts at an after-school program where she can bring her baby . During the summer , she provides child care for a family that works around her class schedule . At this pace , it would take Cucinotta four more years to complete her bachelor 's degree . To speed things along , she says she 's " revving up to apply to the McBride program " for nontraditional-age students at Bryn Mawr , a nearby women 's college . If accepted , she will quit work and depend on grants and loans . Work , school , or both ? Brian Keane opted for a speedier approach from the start . The New York actor wanted to become a licensed psychotherapist , and because he had no family responsibilities , he quit work and enrolled full time at the School of Social Work at New York University ( NYU ) . As for covering living expenses , he found that serendipity can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was planning to gut , Mr. Keane explains , " and he needed someone to keep an eye on it until work started . " This meant Keane could live rent-free for the year and a half it took to complete his degree . To keep up with tuition , Keane availed himself of " every scholarship or grant that came up at the university , " and supplemented these with federal loans . Schools ' financial aid offices stand at the ready to put together aid packages . If studies are job-related , employers may be willing to chip in . If not , a good place to inquire is the Federal Student Aid Information Center of the US Department of Education ( 1-800-4FED-AID or www.ed.gov/proginfo/SFA ) . For many , Cucinotta 's approach is too protracted , Keane 's too radical . Marian Masone did not want to quit work , yet she wanted to earn a master 's degree within a reasonable amount of time . Her solution was to work full time and attend school part time , in order to complete the program in three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but occasionally I had day classes , " she says . " But these were not a problem with my boss : She knew I could just come back to the office and work late . " It helped that Ms. Masone works at the Film Society of Lincoln Center in New York and was getting a master 's in film . <p> Carving out time for relationships One thing Masone did have to sacrifice was her social life . She did not date while in school , and when she took a break it was usually a busman 's holiday : She went to the movies . But she was not willing to let family life go by the wayside . She lives with her sister and takes an active part in helping raise a niece and nephew , who were preteens at the time . " We always sat down together to eat when we could , " Masone says . " Because I was studying film and not something like accounting , there was always an entry point for discussion . " Not all subjects are such easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships not to suffer , people find it important to find ways to share what they are learning . One student who temporarily relocated to another state for graduate work says her boyfriend makes it a point to read books she is assigned . Others use spouses as sounding boards or , as Cucinotta does , enlist their help in prepping for tests , proofreading papers , and discussing the week 's reading . " As a result , " Cucinotta says , " I 've had different kinds of conversations with Dean . We 've discovered a whole new part of each other . " Some students , however , prefer to keep school a separate endeavor . " The constant balancing act is horrible , " says Tony Neuron , a systems librarian who lives with his wife and two teenage children in Roanoke , Va . Mr. Neuron is earning a master 's in library science , but instead of " stealing driblets of time from my family , " he finds it easier to remove himself for a month or a week at a time to attend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This option includes the costs of transportation and lodging . And " taking six weeks out of life is very hard for those who have jobs and family , " says Amanda Cockerell , director of an intensive summer graduate program in children 's literature at Hollins University in Roanoke . Some participants commute home on weekends , some delegate child care to spouses and grandparents , and some even bring their children along , placing older ones in a nearby day camp and finding baby sitters for the younger ones . <p> Taking risks to pursue a dream For Valerie Patterson , a government lawyer in the Washington , D.C. , area who recently registered for this summer 's session at Hollins , the difficulty lies elsewhere . Her desire to someday publish a young-adult novel ( or two , or three ) is highly unlawyerly and , although her superiors have been supportive of her taking leave , she says , " I still worry that I 'll be seen as less serious and that I wo n't get my next promotion , which is a big one and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , however . To pursue a long-held passion , Ms. Patterson is willing to take that risk and to commute , redirect savings , take courses during the year , and accept that her husband may never fully approve of her decision . And if she never publishes a novel ? " I will not regret it , " she says . " Any learning you do in something that you love is not wasted . " <p> Try to keep the balancing act realistic As a professor in the Gallatin School of Individualized Study at New York University , Lauren Raiken has advised many a returning student . His first piece of advice is to have realistic expectations . " If a person is engaged in many areas of life as a parent and a professional , two courses is the maximum he or she should take , " he says . Professor Raiken has found that returning adults " have usually forgotten the amount of work going to school entails , and what it 's like to write a paper . " While most students find ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do too much at once can be dangerous to the quality of learning . " Students find they want to spend more time on campus , at the library or talking with professors and fellow students , but they have to get back to their families or jobs , " he says . This is a frustration few expect , but equally unexpected is the feeling adult students get when they devote themselves to their studies . " This gives them an intense pleasure , " Raiken observes , " because it is something they have chosen to do . " And , in his experience , whether the degree is career-related or for personal enrichment , the excitement is the same . After all , people choose their career for a reason . <p> Whether the degree is career-related or for personal enrichment , the excitement is the same . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2001 .
