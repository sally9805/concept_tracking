Chapter One I crawl toward the enemy , blind and uncertain of my every move . This is not the first battle I have fought over this broken , bloody ground , but it may be my last . The enemy is ruthless and keenly skilled , led by a commander whose battlefield brilliance has consistently outmatched the government 's admittedly wretched field-grade generals . Any commander who can catch a Bolo Mark XX in one successful ambush after another is a force to be reckoned with . I do not make the mistake of underestimating him . I am in pitiful condition for battle , but this rebellion must be stopped . As the only fighting force left on Jefferson with any hope of defeating the rebellion 's high command , it is up to me to restore law and order to this world . Civil war is a bloody business , at best , and this one has been no exception . I am not happy to be caught in the middle of it . I am even less happy with the terrain in which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrain through which I creep is ideal country for the rebel army which has made its strongest camp here . Klameth Canyon is more than a single , twisting cut of rock slashed through the heart of the Damisi Mountains . It is a whole series of canyons , narrow gorges , and tortuous blind corries . Tectonic action buckled ancient sandstone badlands and shoved the broken slabs upwards in a jumble that stretches the length of the continent . The deep canyons carved by wind , weather , and wild rivers still exist , but they have been twisted askew by the titanic forces inherent in the molten heart of a world . Above the ancient canyon walls , the high , broken peaks of the Damisi range climb toward the sky , jagged teeth above a spider 's tangle of gashes in the earth . I have never seen terrain like it and I have been fighting humanity 's wars for more than one hundred twenty years . Even Etaine , the worst killing field I have ever known , was not as disadvantageous as the ground I cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost that battle-and that world . I fear I will lose this one , for there is no worse terrain on Jefferson for fighting an entrenched army . Commodore Oroton , naturally , has chosen it as his final battleground . The only way into-or out of-Klameth Canyon by ground transport is through Maze Gap , which I cleared nearly an hour ago . I anticipate ambush from moment to moment , but the commodore 's gun crews do not fire . I mistrust this quiescence . I have all but given up trying to outthink Commodore Oroton , since I am almost invariably wrong . His battlefield decisions are frequently devoid of straightforward logic , which makes any attempt to predict his moment-to-moment actions fiendishly difficult . If I had a Brigade-trained human commander with plenty of combat experience , he or she would doubtless fare much better than I have , working on my own . But I do not have a human commander , let alone a Brigade officer . The president of Jefferson , to whom I report and from whom I take directives that equate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am legally obligated to obey , under the terms of Jefferson 's treaty with the Concordiat . The president , however , is not a soldier and has never served in any branch of the military , to include Jefferson 's home defense forces . He has never even been a police officer . When it comes to conducting battlefield operations-or outfoxing an enemy commander-Jefferson 's president is spectacularly useless . None of these facts raise my spirits as I crawl through terrain I can barely see . If not for the battle archives I carry in my experience databanks , my situation-and my progress through Klameth Canyon-would be impossible . Using my on-board records , I am at least reasonably able to steer a course through the twists and turns of Klameth Canyon . I am less concerned with ephemera such as houses , barns , and tool sheds that did not exist when I last fought for this ground , because small structures pose no navigational hazards . If necessary , I will simply drive through them . My main concern is what may lie hidden inside or behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened fire . I am tempted to accept the simplest reason , that no one has opened fire because everyone in the canyon is already dead . That guess can not be far from the truth . The only visual images I am able to obtain-ghostly medium IR splotches of muted color-reveal a scene of carnage . Thousands of cooling bodies have dropped below the ambient air temperature of evening . The dead lie packed into training camps where the enemy sheltered , armed , and trained them in techniques of guerilla warfare . Had Commodore Oroton been able to field this army , today 's setting sun might well have gone down on a very different scenario . I scan continuously for power emissions , particularly in the range common to most military equipment , but my search remains futile . Commodore Oroton 's troops have vanished into these broken mountains and the forests that fringe them , leaving me hunting for needles in a **27;1133;TOOLONG haystack-not counting the hundreds of kilometers of side canyons . I grind forward , pausing at each twisting turn , each junction with another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking for emissions that might conceal mobile Hellbores or lesser field artillery , scanning with sputtering IR for some trace of enemy infantry that might be concealed , ready to strike with hyper-v missiles or octocellulose bombs . I have had entirely too many encounters with octocellulose to ignore that particular threat . At each road junction , I chart temperature differentials that might indicate mines scattered in my path , mines that I could see clearly , if my visible-light-spectrum sensors were operational . With nothing but IR working , I could blunder into a minefield-or virtually anything else-without the slightest warning . by the time I swing into the last stretch of canyon between myself and the largest rebel stronghold , night has fallen , increasing my visual-acuity woes . This last stretch of ground is the worst I will face , for the commodore has tucked his base camp into the dead-end turn of the canyon that houses the Klameth Canyon Dam and its hydroelectric power plant . The retaining wall of the dam has turned the deep gorge into a box canyon , of sorts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and going back or climbing up the face of the dam . I can not climb the dam and I will not turn around until my task here is done . The commodore knows this . That is the reason he chose this spot to make a final , defiant stand . I can not blow the dam . My own probable demise-or at least crippling injury-is not the cause for my reluctance . Even discounting the critically needed crops in Klameth Canyon 's fields , which would be destroyed if several billion tons of water were to come crashing through the canyon , there are other important considerations . Not the least of these are the towns lying downriver from Maze Gap . Madison , the capital city , is one of them . I can not blow the dam . How , precisely , I will dislodge Commodore Oroton , I have not yet worked out . If nothing else , I will simply sit there until I starve him and his crew to death . But he will not leave Dead-End Gorge alive . Anticipation builds in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road toward the narrow opening into Dead-End Gorge . The Klameth River runs deep and swift , here , through a channel artificially deepened by terraforming engineers to carry the overflow between the towering cliffs and out into Klameth Canyon , where it irrigates the fertile fields that feed most of Jefferson . I have already crossed and recrossed this river many times , since entering the canyon through Maze Gap . This one , last crossing will take me into the teeth of Commodore Oroton 's guns . This is not mere conjecture . Satellite images of the sheltered canyon , taken over the preceding five days , have revealed a heavy concentration of enemy artillery , including mobile 10cm Hellbores . I detect power emissions of a military type rising faintly from the narrow gorge , all but masked over by the emissions of the hydroelectric plant . The commodore has shut down power to the floodplain-and the capital-by shutting down substations that route power across the Adero floodplain , but the plant itself is still fully operational , fueling the commodore 's operations . The faint military emissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rebellion has acquired in a distressing quantity , but I do not count that as evidence . Oroton has played a long and cagey game with his Hellbores . I assume nothing and merely note the momentary absence of emissions that would positively identify the presence of Oroton 's heaviest artillery . My greatest question is whether or not there is anyone alive to operate that artillery . The biological war agent the government troops detonated prior to my arrival will have killed anyone not protected by biochemical containment suits or inoculated against virals . It is known that Commodore Oroton has access to both , smuggled in from the neighboring star system 's weapons labs . If the gunners were protected , they will launch an attack the moment I am close enough . I have finally reached that point . I rumble toward the narrow bend that gives access to Dead-End Gorge and the dam . The canyon walls , radiating heat they have absorbed during the day , glow more brightly than the pastures and fields . The road is a ribbon of light , warmer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of the surrounding soil , vegetation , or outcroppings of stone . A farmhouse sits next to the road , so close to the verge , I will have to drive through a substantial portion of the structure to reach the dam . This house was not here twenty years ago . Comparison between my on-board records and current conditions reveals the reason for this . A massive rockfall during my battle with the Yavacs devoured nearly a third of the acreage inside a perimeter of well-maintained fences . The original farmhouse was buried in the collapse and doubtless still lies beneath the colossal pile of stone that has not been removed . The farmer rebuilt near the road to conserve land for replanting . A creative solution , but it will lead to a flattened house . I doubt the owner will care , since I can see at least one body lying near the open front door , sprawled across the foyer floor , doubtless running to reach shelter in a " safe room " concealed within the house . If Commodore Oroton plans an ambush before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched from this house . I approach with extreme caution and consider simply blowing the house apart as a prophylactic measure , striking at a possible enemy before he strikes at me . I move forward , sensors straining to their utmost , damaged limits . I am six point zero-nine meters from the corner of the house when sudden motion flares to life . A single person emerges through the front door on a direct attack run toward my warhull . I whip port-side guns around . Acquire the target . Lock on fire-control relays -- and hold my fire . There is , indeed , a person running across the narrow yard toward me . But that individual is not an adult . Given its height , girth , and toddling gait , I surmise that I am facing a very young child . It is perhaps six years old , at most . It carries something in both hands , an object I classify-for seventeen nanoseconds-as a rifle or carbine . I revise that assessment as I note its dimensions and the heat signature it gives off , which suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying it rushes purposefully across the narrow front yard and stops in the middle of the road , directly in my path . " You stop ! " the child says in a high treble voice that I can not decipher as either male or female . The fact that this child is on its feet at all , let alone barring my way , is astonishing , since it wears no biocontainment gear at all . The sole explanation I can devise is that the child was inside a virus-proof safe room when the attack came and that Sar Gremian was correct when he advised me on the anticipated duration of the bioweapon released here : lethal action was expected to cease after forty-five minutes . It has now been an hour since the initial attack . I file the information away as useful data , then engage the child in conversation . " I must enter Dead-End Gorge behind this house . Move out of the road . " " Uh-uh , " the child says , standing fast in front of my treads . " You 're noisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not do that ! " My initial estimate of this child 's age drops by another two years . I scan the house as best I can and detect two other faintly warm shapes besides the one near the front door . I suspect these bodies , which are rapidly assuming the same temperature as their surroundings , belong to the child 's parents or older relatives . I know a momentary anger that these people did not remove their young child from a free-fire zone declared in rebellion . These people chose not to leave . Their young child now stands directly between myself and the rebellion 's high command . Legally , the child is a rebel , a declared enemy . Regardless of its legal status , the child must be removed from my path . If I can not persuade it to move , I will have to kill it , a prospect I do not relish . I must move through this narrow pass , however , and the destruction of one human-even a child-is well within the bounds of acceptable collateral damage . I engage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a halt . My treads have locked up , stopping me literally in my tracks . I sit stupefied for nine point three-eight seconds . My treads are locked . They have locked on their own . Without conscious orders from my Action/Command Core . I attempt to drive forward again . I move a grand total of thirty centimeters . Then my treads lock again . Have they developed a mind of their own , independent of the rest of my psychotronic circuitry ? I perform a rapid self-diagnostic on the processors and subassemblies governing control of my treads and discover no malfunction anywhere in the system . This is cause for serious alarm . I have developed another ghostlike electronic glitch with no apparent determinant . I am now not only blind in most frequencies , I am immobilized . I consist of thirteen thousand tons of flintsteel , advanced weapons systems , and sophisticated psychotronic circuitry and I am stuck like a fly on tar paper . I experiment with reversed engines and succeed in backing up smoothly and efficiently , covering twelve meters effortlessly . I drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
