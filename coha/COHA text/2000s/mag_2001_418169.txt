THE READER Michael Miles , 31 Information system sales Single , club racer Grand Rapids , MI THE PROBLEM " Every summer , I work like a dog to hit my weight goal of 160-165 pounds . When I do , I finish top-10 in local races . Yet every winter , I gain 15-20 pounds and lose fitness . I pledge that I 'll work out , ride every day and keep the weight off , but the peaks and valleys on the Excel spreadsheet I use to track my fitness easily outdo the mightiest of roller coasters . How can I stay fit year-round ? " THE COACH Ryan Tie is head coach of the 100-strong University of Colorado cycling team , which placed second at the 2001 NCCA road championships and won the three previous years . Tie is also the ' 96 NCCA road race champion and former member of the U.S. national team . " My 3-month winter schedule for Michael focuses a month on structured base miles , a month of adding higher intensity , and a month to focus strictly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tie ? Contact him at rtie@usa.net . THE PROGRAM Weeks 1-4 Focus 2 or 3 days on longer rides in Zones 2 and 3 , and recover the others . This training will help Michael lose some weight by increasing the fat-burning enzymes , making him more efficient and allowing him to burn fat instead of stored glycogen in the blood and muscles . Follow each day for Weeks 1-3 , then rest on Week 4 . COACH 'S NOTES The value of training lies in the healing of the body.I like to see riders train for three weeks , then rest ( cut ride lengths in half ) for one . 0 Interval workouts should consist of more extended efforts the first couple of weeks . Toward the end of the phase , they should be shorter and at a near-max workload . Keep doing the intervals during a session until the quality drops off-that means you ca n't get your heart rate up . Your heart is telling you that it is ready to rest . Listen to it . FINDING YOUR ZONE Target zones can be calculated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you feel . In some respects , the sensations are better because they give you a better idea of what is going on with your body . WARM-UP : 30 minutes between Zone 1 and 2 until you start to sweat . ZONE 1 : Less than 125bpm heart rate . ( Like taking your bike for a walk-so slow you feel stupid . ) ZONE 2:72% of max HR ( You feel like you 're getting a workout , but can still talk with a training partner . ) ZONE 3:73% to 84% of max HR . ( A little uncomfortable . You could maintain this pace for an hour or so , but not much more . ) ZONE 4 : 84% to 92% of max HR . ( Very uncomfortable-the pace you 'd ride a 10-mile time trial or a mountain climb in a race . Somewhere in this zone is what 's known as your lactate threshold-where lactic acid accumulates faster than your body can clear it . ) ZONE 5 : Max effort such as a sprint or all-out jump up a short hill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 2 minutes . ) TRAIN WITH BICYCLING !
