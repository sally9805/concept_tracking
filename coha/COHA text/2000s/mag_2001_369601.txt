You would n't book a room at Quebec City 's Ice Hotel for its amenities . There are no minibars , no televisions , no phones  --  not even indoor bathrooms for that matter . Warmth ? The temperature in each of the hotel 's six guest rooms is about 25degreesF . In fact , the beds are made of ice . Jacques Desbois , founder and operator of the Ice Hotel , makes no bones about just what the place offers : " We 're a thrill service , " he says , " not a lodging service . " <P> Yet when the Ice Hotel opened last month , the rooms were booked for weeks . Before the hotel closes at the end of March ( what with the spring thaw and all ) , Desbois and his partners expect to more than meet their operating budget of some $530,000 , thanks to overnight guests ' paying $100 for bed and breakfast , about 40,000 day visitors who pay $8 for a tour , as well as income from numerous corporate events and sponsors . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as you enter its lobby , where the elegant furniture never needs dusting because it 's all made of ice , and the floors never need polishing since they 're carpeted with snow . In the adjoining bar , the guests , all bundled up in their winter coats and hats , are quite happy to tell you that they have traveled from as far as Australia  --  for the adventure and to celebrate life and its major events , including weddings , reunions and birthdays . Whether they describe their adventure as soft or hard and consider snow exotic or familiar , they are ebullient . <P> Desbois , a Quebec businessman , got the idea in 1996 from an article about the first , and at that time only , ice hotel , in Sweden . " Why not build an ice hotel here in Quebec ? " he asked himself . If some 40,000 visitors a year were willing to travel to a tiny village 125 miles above the Arctic Circle to visit the Swedish ice hotel , Desbois reasoned , how many more would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Quebec , which already attracts more than 6 million visitors each year ? Once armed with partners , funding and a feasibility plan , he entered into an agreement with the owners of the Swedish hotel , now in its 10th year , so that he could benefit from their expertise in building a solid , safe structure . Desbois was also confident that he could handle the ephemeral building material , as he had experience building igloo villages for festivals and eco-events . <P> A series of connected igloos covering 10,000 sq . ft. , the hotel is but a few minutes ' walk from the Manoir Montmorency , once home of Queen Victoria 's father , and the mighty waterfalls that have drawn visitors for hundreds of years . There is nothing flimsy about the building , as it 's composed of 4,750 tons of compressed snow and ice . Its domed ceilings are 16 ft. at their peak ; its walls are 7-ft. thick . In the hotel , an ice chandelier shimmers over world-class ice sculptures of various subjects , including animals , an igloo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wintry Quebec scenes are encased in ice in one of two separate art galleries . There 's even a little movie theater , where pelts cover the stadium-style seats and I catch a short film about the North .
