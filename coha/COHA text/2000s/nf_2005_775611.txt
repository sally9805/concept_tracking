We got a new car ! // I was the most excited kid in the world because we finally got a new car , and I did n't even know what make it was . All my father said on the phone was , " I just bought a new car , and it 's a surprise , so , everybody be out in front of the house because I 'm going to pull up exactly at noon . " So right before noon , we stood in the driveway , my brothers , my mom and I , trying to guess what Dad bought . // " Maybe it 's the Ford Fairlane , " Joel , who was fifteen , wondered . // " No , I bet it 's the Bonneville , " Rip , eleven , said with authority . // " He mentioned something about the Chrysler Imperial , " said Mom . // I interrupted , which I always did because I was the youngest and the shortest , which made me the loudest . I was also nine . " Wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got , " as I looked up to the sky with hope , " a Cadillac ? " ( I swear I could hear angels singing. ) // We were silent for a brief moment , all of us considering that heavenly possibility , when we heard Pop 's honk , and there he was waving , as he pulled up in our brand-new , **25;725;TOOLONG , 1957 ... gray-on-gray Plymouth Belvedere . // What the hell was he thinking ? Of all the cool cars out there , he picks this one ? A Plymouth ? And gray ? Gray is n't even its own color , it 's a combination of black and white . And two tones of it ? // This was not the car of my dreams , but at least it was a new car with big fins , red leather interior and push-button transmission . The Plymouth replaced the only car I ever knew in my life and I was glad to see this car go . It was an embarrassing-to-drive- around-Long-Beach-in big , black , boxy , 1948 Chevrolet . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front windshield , so it looked like the car was wearing a fedora . Sometimes it looked like the car was an old-time film noir detective sitting in front of our house . It was n't a family car . This was a getaway car . They killed Sonny on the Causeway in this car . Why on earth would he keep this car for nine years ? // Two reasons . One , we could n't afford anything else ; and two , my father loved this car . He took perfect care of this car . He even named the car . He named the car " Nellie . " Men always name their cars after women , and talk about them like they are women . It 's always , " She 's a beauty , is n't she ? " It 's never , " Is n't Ira a great-looking car ? " Boats are almost always named after wives , daughters , or girlfriends . I have never seen the SS Larry . Even the man who dropped the bomb on Hiroshima named the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mom , I just dropped the A-bomb on Japan and killed eighty thousand people , and I named the plane after you ! " // " Oh son , thank you , I ca n't wait to call Ida , she 's always bragging about her Sidney . " // And men talk to their cars , just like they 're women- " Come on girl , turn over baby , turn over . " Men treat their cars like women : put a lot of miles on them , and eventually they trade them in for newer models . // Toward the end of Nellie 's life with us , she suffered from post-ignition syndrome or PIS , as Emily Dickinson called it . That meant you would turn off the ignition , and poor Nellie would sputter and spew for a few minutes afterward . It sounded like Nellie was an old woman getting in the last words in an argument : // " No , it 's you . It 's you . Not me . It 's you . It 's you . It 's you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not me . It 's you . It 's you . Not me . It 's you . It 's you . It 's you . Not me . It 's you . Not me . Not me . It 's you . Not me . Not me . Fuck you ! " // So finally we have the new car , with its intoxicating " new car smell , " which smells exactly like ... a new car . We took it out for a ride to celebrate at our favorite Chinese restaurant in Long Beach- because it was the only Chinese restaurant in Long Beach-a place on Park Avenue that we loved , a place called Wing Loo . // We were sitting in the front booth , the picture window behind us , and my dad was in a giddy mood . He had a couple of vodka gimlets , which is vodka , with just a splash of gimlet in it . And every time Mr. Loo would go by , Dad would giggle and say , " What 's new , Loo ? " And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as best a gray-on-gray Plymouth Belvedere can . We were having the time of our lives . In other words , a perfect time for something to go wrong . // Big John Ormento was one of the local Mafiosos in Long Beach . There were a number of reputed gangsters living there . In fact in the book of The Godfather , Vito Corleone and family lived in Long Beach . Big John was scary , our Luca Brasi . While we were eating our egg rolls , and drinking our drinks with the little umbrellas in them , we had no idea that Big John Ormento was drunk driving his new car , a 1957 , anti-Semitic Lincoln Continental . And he came roaring up Park Avenue , swerved and slammed into the back of the Belvedere , which then slammed into the back of the car in front of it , reducing our new car to a 1957 gray-on-gray Plymouth Belv ! The crash was tremendous . We turned around so fast lo mein flew out of our mouths hitting and sticking to the window . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage , shook his head a few times and started to laugh . // " Oh my God , it 's Big John , " Mom gasped . " I 'm going out there , " said Dad as he started to push his way out of the black leather booth . // " Do n't , Jack , what if he has a gun ? " Dad ordered another gimlet. // Ormento ran to his car and took off . Ten minutes later , Officer Miller was questioning my father . " Did you see who did this , Mr. Crystal ? " // Dad never hesitated . " No , we heard the crash , and by the time we got out here , they were gone . " Mom looked at Dad , confused a bit , but knowing he probably did the right thing . Joel and Rip and I were dying to tell , but " dying " being the operative word here , we said nothing . // " Some people , " the cop muttered . " Must have been some kid going too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " These kids today ... " // It was a Sunday night , and Dad 's service station , " Stan 's , " was closing early . Stan told Dad he did n't have any room for the car in the shop , but he would tow it to our house and pick it up in the morning . // The twisted piece of metal sat in front of our house , at 549 East Park in Long Beach , Long Island . A sleepy beach town of approximately ten thousand people , which nodded off in the winter and woke up in July to three times as many enjoying a beautiful summer at the sea , Long Beach was surrounded by water . The bay ( Reynold 's Channel ) on one side of town , with its beautiful wetlands ; and the Atlantic Ocean on the other , its thunderous waves hitting the shore of beautiful white sand beaches . The boardwalk stretched the length of the town and featured some amusement park rides . There were games of chance , and a batting cage , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ) and a large municipal swimming pool . Modest homes , and the occasional thirties mansion , dotted the tree-lined streets . A few hotels near the boardwalk were once filled with people , making Long Beach at one time a sort of Atlantic City without the saltwater taffy and the diving horse . The abandoned submarine watch tower , left standing since World War II , was the place to take your girl for a kiss , or smoke a cigarette for the first time . At one time there was horseback riding on the beach , and supposedly George M. Cohan wrote " Only 45 Minutes from Broadway " about Long Beach . // It was known as America 's healthiest city , which is why my sickly grandparents moved there from the Bronx and bought homes for my Uncle Danny and us , in 1951 . It was a wonderful place to live . However , at nine o'clock that Monday morning , Long Beach did n't feel like the safest place to be . // Stunned , the five of us sat in the living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I got it . I always got the door because I thought someday somebody 's going to be there who would take me to Hollywood . // When I opened the door , there was an overcoat , a neck and an eyebrow . Big John Ormento was in the doorway . He looked down at me , which was n't difficult . I was surprised to see his face . Usually gangsters like this are on television , sitting in silhouette confessing to their gruesome crimes , their voices electronically altered , sounding like Darth Vader on Quaaludes . Big John 's voice was deep-it actually seemed to echo-and he had an accent as thick as his police file . // " Can I see your father , please ? " My heart was beating so loud , I thought he could hear it . My throat was dry , making it a full octave higher than it already was . // " I will go and see if there is one here . " And I ran into the living room , faster than a hyperactive midget wrestler. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big John Ormento 's outside . He 's going to kill us . He 's going to kill all of us ! We 're doomed ! " // " Billy , calm down . Calm down . He 's not here to hurt us . He probably just wants to talk to me . Let him in. " // " Me ? I 'm nine ! I 've got everything to live for ! " ( I became a better actor later . ) " Please . " " Let him in. " // I went back to the door to get Big John ; he seemed even bigger , his head was so large it caused a total eclipse of the sun . // " Come on in . " He followed me into the living room . He stood there , looking menacing , and uncomfortable . He stared at my dad , took off his hat , and then he spoke . // " Hey , how fast do think your car was going when it backed into my car ? " // We all froze . Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm just kidding . How you doing ? I 'm John Ormento . Nice to meet you , Mr. Crystal , Mrs. Crystal , you boys here . Listen . I 'm very sorry for what happened to your car last night . Very sorry . It was my fault , it was an accident , believe me , it was an accident . If it was n't an accident , this would be a condolence call . // " I talked to my ' friends ' and they told me you did n't tell the cops nothing . So I want to make it up to yous . " // " Okay , Mr. Ormento . I have my insurance card . We 'll just put it through the insurance company . " // Big John interrupted Dad with an impatient laugh , the same way he probably interrupted somebody who was n't beating up a guy properly . " No , no , no , no . We 're not going to do something stupid like put it through the insurance company , no . Cuz let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " I want to do something special for yous . " Dad looked confused . " What do you mean ' special ' ? " // " I asked around about you , Mr. Crystal . People like you . They respect what you do , and they like your wife and your boys here . Do n't you think you should be driving around in a car that more befits a man of your altitude ? " // We all looked confused . " What are you trying to say , Mr. Ormento ? " " What I 'm trying to say is this , Mr. Crystal . I want to buy you a new car , any car you want , the car of your choice . " // Things were looking up ! Any car we want ? The car of our choice ? Oh baby , I was overjoyed ! All those great cars were now rolling around my brain , like a slot machine : the Impala , the Bel Air , the Thunderbird , the Corvette ! Oh , a Corvette ! Think with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corvette , Corvette , I said to myself over and over , trying to send my message telepathically. // " Let 's just get this car fixed , " Dad said . Shit ! I said to myself . // Big John looked angry , and as he stepped forward , he got bigger . // " Let me ask you something , Mr. K ... " I wanted to correct him , but I have this thing about dying . " You are refusing my offer ? Huh ? That upsets me . You know , that really upsets me , and it confuses me . Why would you not want me to buy you a new car ? " // Dad stood tall and simply said , " Because , Mr. Ormento , I bought this one . " // There was silence as they stared at each other . It got tense . Big John 's shark eyes trying to intimidate , as they lasered into Dad 's eyes , trying to push him to reconsider , and probably thinking , How can I get this guy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only five foot nine and 160 pounds , just stared back at Big John , unafraid. // I looked at my mother . She looked at my father , and she smiled a smile of pride that I 've never , ever forgotten . She took one step over next to him , put her arm around Pop , and together the two of them smiled at Big John Ormento . Those were my parents . // Two weeks later , the car came back . Well , Big John knew a lot about bodywork because the car looked great , and after we opened the trunk to make sure there were no bodies in it , we took it out for a ride . And everything was great until Dad tried to make a right turn . Almost impossible . The car barely reacted to Dad 's turning of the steering wheel . It moaned and groaned ; so did Dad . The car just could n't make right turns very well . They could n't fix that . You actually had to make three left turns in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we had our new car . // They put me up front , in the middle , with my brothers in the back . I sat up front because I was the one who did n't need legroom ; and I still do n't . I always sat in between my mom and my dad because my mom never drove the car when Dad was around ... never . Dad was very much a man of the times . He was the hunter , gatherer , driver ... er ... But when we were sitting like this , she would always take her left arm and put it behind my head and let it rest lightly on the right shoulder of the man that she loved so much . And I would sit in the middle , and I would look at him , my first hero , as he drove that car , his left arm outside the window getting that little yarmulke tan around his elbow , and smoking his cigarette-because they told us in the fifties , " Cigarettes taste good and are so good for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rolls-Royce or a Bentley , never for once thinking he was driving a gray-on-gray Plymouth Belvedere that could n't make right turns . That was my dad . // He worked so hard for us all the time . He held down two jobs , including weekend nights . The only day we really had alone with him was Sunday . Sunday was our day for my two brothers and I to put on a show and make them laugh . Sunday was our day to go up on the boardwalk in Long Beach and play Skeeball or Fascination , go to the batting cage , play baseball , go bowling , or to the movies , even a Broadway show . Sunday night was our night to go out to eat together . We 'd always go out for Italian food , or Chinese food , because on Sunday nights , Jews are not allowed to eat their own food . That 's in the Talmud . " On the seventh day , God rested and then went to Twin Dragons for dinner , because He loved the ribs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday , there are only Jewish families . If you go to a Chinese restaurant , there are only Jewish families . Have you ever seen a Chinese family at a deli on a Sunday having a big plate of pickled herring , and chopped liver ? It does n't happen . // And Dad would come in like three , four o'clock on a Sunday morning after working all weekend . Just as the sun came up , I would tiptoe over to their bedroom , which was right next to my room in the back , and I would quietly open the door just a little , and there they would be , Mom and Dad , lying there , looking so quiet , and so peaceful together . And I would sit in the doorway waiting for him to wake up , just to see what we were going to do together that day . I just could n't wait for Sundays . I could n't wait for Sundays . He died suddenly when I was fifteen . I once calculated that I had roughly 700 Sundays . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for a kid to have with his dad . //
