Lunch with her editor usually meant one thing . Trouble . <p> Carley could n't think of anything she 'd done to warrant the meeting . Granted , she had n't written any award-winning stories for the newspaper lately , but she 'd held her own . Every deadline had been met . The stories had been newsworthy . But something was clearly on Matt 's mind . His forehead creased with concern as they took their seats at a small deli near the office . <p> " They have good burgers here , " Matt said , scanning the menu . He was stalling . <p> " I 'm just going to have a salad . " Closing the menu , she folded her hands and waited . It was straight-up noon , and the harried waitress was taking orders several tables over . Carley was glad to see her favorite sandwich shop back in business and full of hungry patrons . It had taken months for Houston to recover from the devastating effects of the hurricane , but life had obviously returned to normal . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for Matt to drop whatever news had prompted the lunch . <p> Matt finally closed his menu and sighed . " Carley , you 're a good reporter ... " The lines above his bushy brows became more prominent . She waited for the but . He cleared his throat instead , and she took the opportunity to remind him of her tenure . <p> " I 've been with the paper four years . I 'd like to think I 've done a good job . " He nodded his agreement , although his expression remained solemn . " What 's wrong , Matt ? " <p> She searched his face , her heart rate kicking up . Matt had been her editor at the paper since she started , and they 'd been to lunch only twice . Once as a celebration of sorts when she won a prestigious award , and once when Matt felt an article she wrote had crossed the journalistic line . <p> She had n't won any awards lately . <p> " Carley , you 've got plenty of unused vacation . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the jagged scar spanning three inches across her left forearm . Instinctively , her right hand covered the evidence of the event that had forever altered her life . <p> " I took two weeks off when Mom died . " Where is he going with this ? It 's been six months since the accident . <p> " Carley , " he grumbled , " that was n't a vacation , and part of that time you were in the hospital yourself . " He shook his head as the waitress approached . <p> " I 'll have the grilled chicken salad , " Carley said after Matt ordered his burger and fries . She immediately regretted her decision . What was the point ? You could n't live forever . She bet her mother would have loaded up with an extra helping of pie on Christmas Day if she 'd known it was her last day on earth . <p> " No , wait . I change my mind . I 'll have a burger and fries too . " <p> " Good girl , " Matt said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin as it is . " <p> " Now what were you saying , Matt ? " She 'd rather get this over with and salvage her appetite . <p> " I want you to take some vacation time . " <p> Although his tone left little room for argument , she quickly countered . " I do n't need a vacation . " <p> " If you do n't see it , then I 'll just come out and say it : you are n't at the top of your game . You 're a far cry from it , Carley . Your stories lack the zing they used to have . The facts are there , but they 're lacking ... What 's the word I 'm looking for ? " <p> " I have no idea . " She folded her arms across her chest . <p> " Emotional capacity , " he continued . " You used to weave emotion into your stories-just enough to spruce up the article . " He shrugged , and she saw the pity in his eyes as they locked with hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there anymore . " <p> " I-I did n't realize that . " She fought the sudden tremor in her voice . " I 'll work harder . " <p> When it appeared Matt was going to argue , she dug deep for the truth . " I need to work , Matt . It 's all I have . " <p> She dropped her gaze , hating the vulnerability she knew her expression revealed . Matt has to understand . I ca n't take any time off . What would I do ? Until six months ago , her leisure time had been divided among her mother , her boyfriend , and her friends . Now her mom was gone , and Dalton had broken off their three-year relationship . And after one too many declines , her few girlfriends quit asking her to participate in their activities . <p> She had nothing but work . <p> " That 's what I mean , Carley , " Matt urged . " You are a beautiful woman with no relationships or interests outside of work . You 're slowly withdrawing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He leaned over the table . " Carley , on a personal note , we 're worried about you . " <p> " Who is we ? " She knew the answer . " Katrina ? " <p> Her reporting rival had bumped up a notch to assistant editor awhile back and now latched onto every opportunity to remind Carley of her position . <p> " Yes , Katrina and I discussed it , Carley , but- " <p> " She does n't like me , Matt . " <p> Right away she realized the comment sounded childish . <p> " Not true . " Matt shook his head and pushed an envelope in Carley 's direction . " This is a month 's vacation pay . You 've accumulated a lot more than that . Take a month off , Carley . Come back refreshed . You should have taken more time off after the accident . " <p> Carley peered at the envelope on the table as the waitress returned with their lunches and offers of ketchup and extra napkins . " I 'm not taking a vacation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my time right now ? " <p> " Because you would n't like the alternative . " He wrapped his mouth around his burger . <p> Carley was n't hungry for anything except Katrina Peighton 's hide . This was her doing , not Matt 's . <p> " So let me get this straight . Either I go on vacation or I 'm fired ? " <p> " Do n't look at it that way , Carley , " Matt said between bites . " Take advantage of this . I would . " <p> Her thoughts churned . What will I do ? Sit around my big empty house ? <p> No . Too much time to think . <p> She bargained . " I 'll take a week off . " <p> " A month , Carley . We will welcome you back with open arms in one month . " <p> By the end of the meal , she 'd reluctantly accepted the envelope . Not that she had any choice in the matter . Matt made it quite clear her vacation started directly after lunch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road as she studied the map laid out beside her on the car seat . She 'd never been to Lancaster County , Pennsylvania , but a sign flashed by , indicating twenty-six miles to the town of Paradise . Good . She was on the right track . <p> She watched the farmland scrolling by and thought about seeing Lillian . Her friend had fled the craziness of Houston a year and a half ago , moved in with her Amish grandparents , married an Amish man , and now happily resided in the town of Paradise with her new family . Carley could n't help but wonder how much her friend might have changed . From her initial letters Carley knew Lillian 's grandparents ' farm in Paradise had provided Lillian with a safe haven where she could get her life together . But when Lillian wrote to say she had converted and was staying-that was a lot to swallow . Carley could n't get past the lack of electricity , much less the fact that Lillian had married Amish widower Samuel Stoltzfus , become a stepmother to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own . <p> Of course , Carley knew she had changed too . Everything had changed last Christmas Day ... <p> According to Lillian 's letters , she had been baptized in the Amish faith-a required step toward marrying an Amish man . Her friend also adhered to all their Plain customs , including the wardrobe . It was an unbelievable transformation . No television , makeup , jewelry . No computer . <p> Hmm . Carley eyed her laptop on the floorboard of the rental car . How was she going to charge the battery ? <p> One thing shone through in all Lillian 's letters : she was happy . As a writer , Carley excelled at reading between the lines . She had looked for clues that perhaps Lillian was n't as content as she let on . She could n't find one . Lillian 's destination seemed to have brought her the peace Carley knew Lillian longed for . <p> Carley felt like she was still wandering , her own destination unknown . <p> Which brought her to her current situation . In her last letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might come for a visit and do an article about the Amish ways . Lillian quickly responded with an invitation-which Carley accepted the day her forced vacation began . She would put her leave to good use . Even better , she would incorporate work into her trip . <p> Work would keep her sane . <p> * * * <p> Lillian popped a loaf of bread into the gas oven . Carley would be hungry when she arrived . Hopefully her friend would like the meatloaf and baked corn casserole she had prepared , along with the chocolate shoofly pie for dessert . If she hurried , she could have the meal ready before Anna woke up for her feeding . <p> She scanned the wooden table in the middle of the kitchen . It was covered with a variety of jellies and applesauce and some pickled red beets . For a moment she pondered whether she should have tackled the sauerbraten recipe instead . But the meatloaf was a lot less work , and Anna had been fussy all afternoon . She 'd fallen behind on the household chores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of the rich shoofly with its filling of molasses and brown sugar . <p> Or maybe she should stop worrying so much about Carley 's arrival . But she could n't help it . Their last time together , Lillian had sported blue jeans , a name-brand blouse , stilettos , full makeup and silver jewelry , and a designer handbag . <p> She tucked a loose strand of hair beneath her white Kapp , glancing down at her blue linen dress covered by a black apron . Her plain black leather shoes were a far cry from the spiked heels of her past . <p> The screen door slammed shut behind her . Samuel . <p> " It smells gut in here , " he said , kissing her smile before tossing his hat onto the rack in the den . <p> " Danki . I hope it 's gut . " She breathed in the aroma of baking bread while she mixed the sauce that would go on top of the meatloaf . " I hope Carley likes it . " <p> " Your friend will be here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her Englisch friend coming to visit . They had discussed it , and although Samuel assured her it was fine for Carley to stay with them for the month of May , Lillian also knew Carley 's visit was an exception to an unspoken rule : no outsiders allowed . But it was n't that long ago she 'd been the outsider in the Old Order Amish district . How quickly a year and a half had gone by . <p> " She should be here any minute , " Lillian informed Samuel . " It 's almost four thirty , and I know you must be hungry . David should be home soon too . He 's at Mamm ' s doing some yard work . " She stirred the sauce atop the gas range . " I think you 'll like Carley , Samuel . And she promised me the story she writes for her newspaper will include only things we 're comfortable with . " <p> She caught the uncertainty on Samuel 's face , which he quickly hid with a half smile . " Ya , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said there are a lot of misconceptions written about the way we live . Would n't it be nice for someone to get it right in print ? " She challenged his skepticism with a playful wink , hoping to alleviate some of his fear . <p> " Ya , it 's just that ... " He hesitated , grimacing . <p> " What ? " She turned the fire down under the sauce and slid in beside him at the kitchen table . <p> " I 'm sure everything will be fine , Lillian . I just do n't trust those who print words about our lives , and I do n't know this Englisch woman . " <p> Lillian grasped his hand . " But I do . And I trust her , Samuel . " <p> " Then I will trust her too . " He gave her hand a squeeze . " Now where 's my little boppli ? " <p> " Anna should be waking up hungry any minute . I was just trying to finish supper before Carley gets here . " She returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gut person , Samuel . Try not to worry . " <p> As his arms wrapped tightly around her waist , Samuel nuzzled the back of her neck . " You are a gut person , Lillian . Besides , worry is a sin . " <p> " Ya , it is , " she whispered as she tried to push aside her own worries over Carley 's arrival . <p> * * * <p> Carley pulled into the dirt driveway off Black Horse Road . In the distance , she could see two gray buggies parked beside a white farmhouse surrounded by colorful foliage . Two crimson barns stood off to one side . Drawing closer , she noticed two horses peeking out the window of the smaller structure . The place was incredibly manicured-neatly trimmed grass in the yard , and the fields freshly cut as well . She could already picture herself watching the sunset from one of the wooden rockers on the large wraparound porch . It would be like living in a postcard . <p> She continued to scan her surroundings as she parked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped out of the car , she poked her head inside one of the boxlike transports . Black leather seats and room enough for four . She could n't wait to go for a ride . <p> The squeak of a screen door drew her attention toward the house . The woman running down the porch steps-in a blue dress with a black apron , white cap , and black shoes-might have been hard to recognize on the street . But Lillian 's full smile and bubbly bounce gave her away instantly . That was how Carley remembered Lillian , and she was glad to see some things had n't changed . <p> " Lillian ! " She hurried across the yard , greeting her friend with a hug . " You look great ! " It was true . Her friend 's transformation into an Amish woman worked for her . Dressed in her Plain clothes , devoid of makeup and the accessories of the past , her face gleamed . Carley could only assume it was the peacefulness Lillian had spoken of in her letters . <p> Carley needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot different than the last time you saw me . " Lillian 's voice sounded uncertain . <p> " Yes , you do . You look happy . And I 'm so glad for you . Where 's the baby ? " She could n't wait to get her hands on little Anna . <p> " Inside with Samuel . Come in , come in . " Lillian grabbed Carley 's hand and tugged her toward the house with the enthusiasm she was known for . " You look great , too , Carley . You really do . " <p> It was a sweet thing to say . And Lillian tried to sound convincing . But Carley knew she did n't look great . The past six months had taken their toll . <p> Forcing the thought aside , she clomped up the porch steps behind Lillian . When they reached the top , Lillian stopped and eyed Carley 's shoes . " I 'll tell you a secret , " she whispered . " I miss fancy shoes . " <p> Carley looked down at her friend 's feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I bet those are a lot more comfortable than these . " She pointed to her brown , pointy-toed pumps . <p> " Oh , I 'm sure they are . But if you catch me trying on your shoes while you 're here , do n't tell anyone . " <p> " It 'll be our secret . " <p> The two of them giggled like schoolgirls . It felt good . As Lillian ushered her into the house , Carley wondered if Matt had been right . Maybe she did need a vacation . Being around Lillian might provide a much-needed reprieve from the grief that had blanketed her in Houston . <p> They entered the house through the kitchen . Backless benches on each side of a wooden table stretched long enough to seat at least ten people . While there were no ornate carvings on the table or benches , the colorful display of various foods complemented it . <p> Plain whitewashed walls and white countertops were enhanced by vibrant blooms on each of the three windowsills . No microwave or electrical gadgets . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pans next to the stove , there were no wall hangings . The room was functional yet charming . <p> Carley glanced up at the lantern dangling from the ceiling above the middle of the table . " Wow . " <p> Lillian stood at a gas range against the far wall , swirling a spoon in a large pot . Wonderful aromas emanated from that part of the room . " It 's a lot different from the kitchen I had in Houston , " she said sheepishly as she set the spoon on the countertop and motioned for Carley to join her at the kitchen table . " But you know how much I like to cook . And one thing is for certain : Samuel and David like to eat . " <p> " Do you miss it-your life before , I mean ? The modern conveniences ? " <p> " Nope , " Lillian said without reservation , then paused with a twinkle in her eye . " Only the shoes . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
