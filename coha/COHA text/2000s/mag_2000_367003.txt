Whatever else you may think about testosterone , you can tell it 's a hot topic . Every time you mention that you happen to be writing about it , the first thing people ask is " Can you get me some ? " ( Everybody , even the women . ) Maybe that 's not so surprising . If there is such a thing as a bodily substance more fabled than blood , it 's testosterone , the hormone that we understand and misunderstand as the essence of manhood . Testosterone has been offered as the symbolic ( and sometimes literal ) explanation for all the glories and infamies of men , for why they start street fights and civil wars , for why they channel surf , explore , prevail , sleep around , drive too fast , plunder , bellow , joust , plot corporate takeovers and paint their bare torsos blue during the Final Four . Hey , what 's not to like ? <P> Until now , it was easy to talk about testosterone but hard to do much about it . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce enough take a doctor-prescribed synthetic version , mostly by self-injection , every one to three weeks . But the shots can not begin to mimic the body 's own minute-by-minute micromanagement of testosterone levels . So they can produce a roller coaster of emotional and physical effects , from a burst of energy , snappishness and libido in the first days to fatigue and depression later . The main alternative , a testosterone patch , works best when applied daily to the scrotum , an inconvenient spot , to put it mildly . Some doctors recommend that you warm that little spot with a blow dryer , which may or may not be fun . <P> All of that will change this summer when an easy to apply testosterone ointment , AndroGel , becomes generally available for the first time by prescription . The company that developed it , Illinois-based Unimed Pharmaceuticals , promises that because AndroGel is administered once or more a day , it will produce a more even plateau of testosterone , avoiding the ups and downs of the shots . Though the body 's own production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of 30 or so , not many men now seek testosterone-replacement therapy ( not that they necessarily need to ) or even get their T levels tested . But replace the needles and patches with a gel , something you just rub into the skin like coconut oil during spring break at Daytona Beach , and suddenly the whole idea seems plausible . <P> Testosterone , after all , can boost muscle mass and sexual drive . ( It can also cause liver damage and accelerate prostate cancer , but more on that later . ) That makes it central to two of this culture 's rising preoccupations : perfecting the male body and sustaining the male libido , even when the rest of the male has gone into retirement . So will testosterone become the next estrogen , a hormone that causes men to bang down their doctor 's doors , demanding to be turned into Mr. T ? Do not underestimate the appeal of any substance promising to restore the voluptuous powers of youth to the scuffed and dented flesh of middle age . If you happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal to your inner hood ornament , to that image of yourself as all wind-sheared edges and sunlit chrome . And besides , there 's the name : testosterone ! Who can say no to something that sounds like an Italian dessert named after a Greek god ?
