Sometimes it does n't pay to be too popular . By the time of his death in 1985 , at age 97 , Marc Chagall was suburbia 's favorite genius . He offered modernism without tears , without the headaches of Cubism or the thin air of abstraction . For middle-class Jews , he was also the chronicler of the world of their fathers , the poet of that lost , enchanted universe . By the mid-1960s , when Fiddler on the Roof took its title from one of Chagall 's best-known motifs , his popular reputation was at its peak . But in the eyes of an art world that had always been a little unconvinced by him , he had become the middlebrow modernist , the go-to guy for shopworn lyricism , bathos and kitsch . <P> Can this reputation be saved ? You bet it can .

He did . But he was also a great and original artist , one who could produce work as deeply gratifying as any Bonnard , as inventive as any wriggle by Miro . <P> Chagall 's lifelong touchstone was Vitebsk , the Russian village where he was born in 1887 . His parents were Yiddish-speaking Hasidim , descended from a culture suspicious of imagery but possessing a long tradition of mysticism and of the spiritual ecstasy that courses through his art . In My Life , the lovely but unreliable memoir that he wrote when he was just 35 , Chagall recalls how his family used painted canvases to protect the wooden floors of their house . " My sisters , " he observes dryly , " thought pictures were made expressly for that purpose . " <P> Chagall had other purposes in mind .

Chagall demurred . He wanted no part of the Surrealist notion that art flowed from the dictates of the unconscious . What Chagall believed was that art flowed from his whole self , from his memories and desires . Let the world fly apart under his brush ; he was always the master of his own revels . <P> In particular the revels of romance . Next to Jewish life , his great topic was love , especially for Bella , the woman he married in 1915 . In Lovers in the Red Sky , painted in 1950 , six years after her death , a couple flies together through the air , as Chagall and Bella had done in so many of his other paintings .
