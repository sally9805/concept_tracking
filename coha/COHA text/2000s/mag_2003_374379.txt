In a clinical trial that got a lot of publicity last year , the herb St.-John's-wort failed to work better than a placebo in treating severe depression . The study also showed that Zoloft , one of the most popular prescription antidepressants , did no better than a placebo either , but that result attracted little attention . In the real world , people do not take St.-John's-wort for severe depression  --  they use it for mild to moderate conditions . Zoloft , on the other hand , is considered a powerful weapon in the ongoing war on mental illness . <P> With good reason , a lot of people have questions about the efficacy of psychiatric medications , as well as concerns about their side effects and overuse , especially in children . This has led many consumers to explore alternative therapies , most of which have yet to get the fair clinical trials they deserve . But it is safe to say that many work for obvious reasons , some of them so simple they are often overlooked by psychiatrists , psychologists and researchers . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and effective treatment for depression , but it has many other health benefits as well , from improving cardiovascular and immune functions to controlling weight . Aerobic exercise works , in part , by stimulating the release of endorphins , a class of endogenous antidepressants made in the brain . It both treats and prevents depression in susceptible individuals , and I prescribe it frequently . For best results , try to get 45 minutes of sustained aerobic activity an average of five days a week . Any activity that raises your heart rate and gets you breathing fast will do . Walking is fine if you do it quickly enough or include some uphill time . <P> Another simple intervention I often recommend is breath work . Breath control is the most powerful method I have found to reduce anxiety , even in its most severe form of panic disorder . Conventional drugs suppress anxiety but often cause significant side effects and dependence . I have found it is impossible to be anxious while breathing deeply , slowly , quietly and regularly . By working on those qualities in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cutting short an anxiety attack . Breathing exercises derived from yoga are even more effective . With practice , breath work quiets down the nervous system . This not only blunts anxiety but also lowers blood pressure , slows the heart rate , improves circulation and digestion , and helps protect the body from the damaging effects of stress . <P> Breath work is a natural segue to meditation , because the simplest meditation technique is concentration on the breath . The association of meditation with Eastern religion is an obstacle for some Americans , but many nonreligious forms exist . In essence , meditation is nothing other than focused awareness . Although it can be used as a relaxation technique , I find it most valuable as a method of restructuring the mind , breaking habitual patterns of thought and creating seeds of balance to oppose erratic mood swings . Over time it can provide great mental-health benefits : relief from ordinary anxiety and depression , better rest and sleep , and increased resistance to disturbing influences on emotional equilibrium .
