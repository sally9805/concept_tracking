" If we have the votes and the guts , we 'll prevail . " // In early January 2001 , at breakfast in the Senate Dining Room , John McCain was in an upbeat mood . The large , ornate room was nearly empty ; the new Congress had only recently convened and the new President was n't to be sworn in for another couple of weeks . // McCain was already revved up for the next round in the battle he had been waging for many years to reform the nation 's campaign finance laws . For McCain , campaign finance reform was about a broader ethic . As he demonstrated in his campaign for the Republican nomination in 2000 , he sees it as essential to restoring the public 's faith in politics , and also to attracting young people into politics and government service . For him , it has much to do with the very definition of the country , the workability of the democratic idea . // In the coming year , McCain was to broaden his agenda , become arguably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at times more popular than even the President  --  and point the way toward a new kind of reform politics . And in the weeks after the terrible events of September 11 , his was the most consistently sought-after , and the clearest , voice out of Washington . During this time , he defined the situation , rallied the public 's morale , and soothed it when it became fearful . // He understood that there was a more civic-minded streak , an idealism , in the public than more conventional politicians appealed to . His disdain for the conventions of politics had gained him a large following  --  which went beyond the more than six million people who voted for him in 2000 . He had an effortless feel for the national psyche and a natural instinct for the right thing to say . His efforts in the course of the year were to reveal new aspects of his character . // Now , as he undertook his seventh year of leading the effort to reform the campaign finance system , there were reasons for optimism . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election , the new Democratic senators providing a presumed four more votes for reform , and the Senate was now divided 50-50 , with the Republicans in nominal control because vice-president-elect Dick Cheney could break a tie . ( This was before James Jeffords switched from being a Republican to being an Independent. ) // McCain 's effort to enact reform of the campaign finance system had met with defeat in the Senate five times in the past six years . The House passed its version of his bill twice by wide margins , so the Senate became the crucible . A majority of the Senate had supported McCain 's bill in the past  --  or ostensibly so  --  but the opponents of change , led by Republican Senator Mitch McConnell , of Kentucky , and Majority Leader Trent Lott , first choked off debate so that amendments could n't be offered to broaden support and then killed the bill by filibuster . Now McCain was determined to have an open debate , which could help him attract additional support by accepting amendments sponsored by senators who were on the fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want reform but did n't want to say so from playing devious parliamentary games , and hiding behind McConnell , as they had in 1999. // Referring to the last time he had fought for his bill , in 1999 , when some of his Senate colleagues ripped into him because he had accurately called the current system corrupt , McCain said , " I 'm not going to let them pull me into a personal combat . That was my worst test . I 'm not going to engage in that again . " McCain was in fact to make an important strategic change based on that lesson . // At the same time , McCain believed that the current campaign finance system was more of a plague on the body politic than ever . He said , " It 's badly skewed our priorities , and blocked badly needed legislation to help the American people . It 's never been worse in my time here . It affects everything : the tax code , the military , Medicare , Social Security , gambling  --  you name it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been acted on , or cite the Telecommunications Act of 1996 , which was nothing like reform . " Of that bill , McCain often said , " All the interests were at the table but the public interest . " // " I 'm just going to go ahead , " McCain said over the breakfast in early January . " It 's obvious that the longer you wait , the harder it is . On January 22 , or whatever day we start business , I 'll ask unanimous consent to move to consider our bill . If they block it , I 'll come back the next day and the next day and then we 'll have to start tying things up  --  and they have to know that . We just wo n't let them proceed . The first bill they bring up , we 'll offer it as an amendment . They do n't have sixty votes for cloture now the number needed to shut down a filibuster or even fifty-one votes to block us by tabling my amendment . " // Tom Daschle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democrats would stick with him at least on the early procedural issues . McCain said , " All it boils down to is if we have the votes and the guts , we 'll prevail . " // McCain 's presidential campaign struck a chord when he told people he would " shake things up in Washington . " Public disgust with the role of money in our political system was rising , and he gave it voice . The amount of money spent in a presidential election had grown by more than half a billion dollars since 1996 , to $2.75 billion in the 2000 election . The amounts in themselves , though quite large , were less significant than what they reflected : the ever-increasing time that the politicians had to spend raising the money , the access and commitments ( spoken or understood ) that came with accepting that money , especially the six- or seven-figure amounts in " soft money "  --  unregulated union , corporate , or individual contributions . // Another factor in McCain 's favor now was that senators who had recently been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were becoming increasingly alarmed at both the amounts of money they had to raise and the number of ads by outside groups , some of mysterious origin , that could come at them from any direction . // A small band of Republicans had been with McCain in previous fights , but he needed some more in order to head off a filibuster against his bill . Despite his optimism McCain knew that he was asking incumbents to do a very hard thing : to change the system by which they 'd been elected . He said , " This threatens every lobbyist on K Street . This threatens every business interest . So you ca n't underestimate the opposition . This thing will be trickier and more devious than anything I 've ever done . It 's a house of mirrors . " // President-elect George W. Bush had shown scant interest in reform . After McCain walloped him in New Hampshire , Bush 's aides redesigned their candidate as " a reformer with results " for the next contest , in South Carolina , and Bush offered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Bush himself made little of during the rest of the campaign . // Since the election , the two men had had only perfunctory contact  --  though McCain had campaigned with Bush in five states . McCain had also campaigned for about forty Republican House candidates and was credited by Tom Davis , the chairman of the House Republican campaign committee , with keeping the House in Republican hands . " I made a mistake early on , " McCain said . " Several months before the election , I campaigned for a couple of guys who were n't for campaign finance reform . The opponents who were Democrats and were for campaign finance reform wrote me and said , ' What 's the deal here ? ' I thought their complaints were legitimate , so after that I only campaigned for people who were for campaign finance reform . That 's why I did n't go to the State of Washington for Slade Gorton an incumbent Republican senator who lost narrowly and did n't go to a number of places . If they were n't for it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The McCain-Bush nomination struggle had left a substantial residue of bitterness between both the two men and their respective staffs . The McCain people remained especially bitter over the rough tactics that the Bush campaign and its allies had employed in South Carolina . The onslaught against McCain involved not just attacking his character but also distorting his campaign positions and spreading ugly rumors about his family . A retired Democratic South Carolina politician described it later as " the dirtiest , nastiest campaign I 've ever seen . " Mark Salter , McCain 's closest aide , said , " I ca n't for the life of me see why they have a grudge against us . " The Bush camp 's resentment obviously stemmed from the fact that McCain had interrupted what was supposed to be Bush 's stately march to the Republican Party 's coronation . McCain defeated Bush in eight primaries , and though he made some missteps of his own , he was ultimately defeated by Bush 's superior resources and closed primaries in which only Republicans could vote . ( McCain had been winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially young people , into politics . ) When President-elect Bush first came to Washington in December to confer with congressional leaders , he referred to McCain distantly as " my former opponent . " // A few days after the election , Bush called McCain , and McCain suggested that they needed to meet and talk about campaign finance reform . Bush agreed . Later , Bush called McCain to thank him for holding an early hearing on his proposed Commerce Secretary but did n't bring up the issue of reform . " He did n't bring it up , and I did n't bring it up , " McCain said . " Look , whenever he and I have a conversation , it 's always cordial. " // But McCain believed that Karl Rove , Bush 's chief political strategist during the election , was controlling the political agenda . Much of the bitterness between the two campaigns got back to Rove , who was not only Bush 's chief political tactician but also had a longstanding feud , going back to their early days as consultants , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made it clear the previous summer that he would have waged the campaign finance fight whether Bush or Gore had won the Presidency ( " We will have blood all over the floor of the Senate " ) , McCain said on that early January morning , " Do n't underestimate the anger that this has generated among people like Karl Rove . ' Here 's that spoiler McCain again . ' I 'm really intent on keeping smiling , no matter what they do , keep the game face on "  --  a typical McCain expression . // McCain wanted early consideration of his bill because procedural delays could work against getting it through the Congress at all . And he had his eye on Bush 's pen . McCain said , " It just seems to me that if we pass a bill early on by pretty significant margins , he 'll have to think long and hard before vetoing it . " In fact , McCain and his aides suspected that , with the help of Majority Leader Lott , the White House was pursuing a veto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it did  --  the easier it would be for Bush to veto it because he would have other victories under his belt . McCain was already trying to collect enough commitments to show that this time he would have sixty votes to shut off a filibuster . // Meanwhile , Mark Buse , McCain 's aide for campaign finance reform legislation , had already begun negotiating with a Lott aide about when the bill could be brought up . Lott offered to let that happen after Congress finished work on all of the appropriations bills , which usually means the end of the year . " I told Mark , " McCain said , " ' Tell him we were entertained by their offer . ' " " Entertain " is another McCain word , often used sarcastically . Though McCain is dead serious about the issues he takes on , he does n't take the give-and-take , the legislative gamesmanship , too solemnly . There 's a streak of the mischievous in him , the scamp , which adds to his enjoyment of what he does and helps him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive the North Vietnamese prison camps . His highest form of praise for someone is to tell them , " We 'd have had fun in the camps . " // Despite his threats , McCain was actually angling for the bill to be brought up in March . He had more public support to build , more allies to acquire . But he was thinking ahead . // McCain 's view of human relations seems to be heavily influenced by his five-and-a-half years in " the camps " in North Vietnam : He and his allies would never betray each other . And that 's how , at the beginning of the year , he viewed his close friend Chuck Hagel , of Nebraska , one of four senators who had backed McCain 's presidential campaign . Unbeknownst to McCain , Hagel was already talking to the White House about his own proposal . While McCain would completely abolish soft money , Hagel would enshrine it in national law for the first time by capping soft money contributions at $60,000 per year  --  but also leaving a gaping loophole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was talking up Hagel 's proposal in the Senate Republican Conference ; it also had the support of Republican strategists and lobbyists . It gave reform opponents something to be for . // " We are as close as you can be in the Senate , " McCain said of Hagel , " but that does n't bridge our disagreement on some issues . I know he would not do anything to harm me . I think all he wants is a vote on his proposal . Maybe Mitch may throw votes behind him , but I do n't think he has fifty-one . We 'll fight it out , and if there 's a glaring loophole that emasculates campaign finance reform , I 'll vote against final passage and be done with it . " //
