I // Had enough ? // Am I the only guy in this country who 's fed up with what 's happening ? Where the hell is our outrage ? We should be screaming bloody murder . We 've got a gang of clueless bozos steering our ship of state right over a cliff , we 've got corporate gangsters stealing us blind , and we ca n't even clean up after a hurricane much less build a hybrid car . But instead of getting mad , everyone sits around and nods their heads when the politicians say , " Stay the course . " // Stay the course ? You 've got to be kidding . This is America , not the damned Titanic . I 'll give you a sound bite : Throw the bums out ! // You might think I 'm getting senile , that I 've gone off my rocker , and maybe I have . But someone has to speak up . I hardly recognize this country anymore . The President of the United States is given a free pass to ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to war on a pack of lies . Congress responds to record deficits by passing a huge tax cut for the wealthy ( thanks , but I do n't need it ) . The most famous business leaders are not the innovators but the guys in handcuffs . While we 're fiddling in Iraq , the Middle East is burning and nobody seems to know what to do . And the press is waving pom-poms instead of asking hard questions . That 's not the promise of America my parents and yours traveled across the ocean for . I 've had enough . How about you ? // I 'll go a step further . You ca n't call yourself a patriot if you 're not outraged . This is a fight I 'm ready and willing to have . // My friends tell me to calm down . They say , " Lee , you 're eighty-two years old . Leave the rage to the young people . " I 'd love to  --  as soon as I can pry them away from their iPods for five seconds and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up because it 's my patriotic duty . I think people will listen to me . They say I have a reputation as a straight shooter . So I 'll tell you how I see it , and it 's not pretty , but at least it 's real . I 'm hoping to strike a nerve in those young folks who say they do n't vote because they do n't trust politicians to represent their interests . Hey , America , wake up . These guys work for us . // WHO ARE THESE GUYS , ANYWAY ? // Why are we in this mess ? How did we end up with this crowd in Washington ? Well , we voted for them  --  or at least some of us did . But I 'll tell you what we did n't do . We did n't agree to suspend the Constitution . We did n't agree to stop asking questions or demanding answers . Some of us are sick and tired of people who call free speech treason . Where I come from that 's a dictatorship , not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the fault of right-wing Republicans or liberal Democrats . That 's an intellectually lazy argument , and it 's part of the reason we 're in this stew . We 're not just a nation of factions . We 're a people . We share common principles and ideals . And we rise and fall together . // Where are the voices of leaders who can inspire us to action and make us stand taller ? What happened to the strong and resolute party of Lincoln ? What happened to the courageous , populist party of FDR and Truman ? There was a time in this country when the voices of great leaders lifted us up and made us want to do better . Where have all the leaders gone ? // THE TEST OF A LEADER // I 've never been Commander in Chief , but I 've been a CEO . I understand a few things about leadership at the top . I 've figured out nine points  --  not ten ( I do n't want people accusing me of thinking I 'm Moses ) . I call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not fancy or complicated . Just clear , obvious qualities that every true leader should have . We should look at how the current administration stacks up . Like it or not , this crew is going to be around until January 2009 . Maybe we can learn something before we go to the polls in 2008 . Then let 's be sure we use the leadership test to screen the candidates who say they want to run the country . It 's up to us to choose wisely . // So , here 's my C list : // A leader has to show CURIOSITY . He has to listen to people outside of the " Yes , sir " crowd in his inner circle . He has to read voraciously , because the world is a big , complicated place . George W. Bush brags about never reading a newspaper . " I just scan the headlines , " he says . Am I hearing this right ? He 's the President of the United States and he never reads a newspaper ? Thomas Jefferson once said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have a government without newspapers , or newspapers without a government , I should not hesitate for a moment to prefer the latter . " Bush disagrees . As long as he gets his daily hour in the gym , with Fox News piped through the sound system , he 's ready to go . // If a leader never steps outside his comfort zone to hear different ideas , he grows stale . If he does n't put his beliefs to the test , how does he know he 's right ? The inability to listen is a form of arrogance . It means either you think you already know it all , or you just do n't care . Before the 2006 election , George Bush made a big point of saying he did n't listen to the polls . Yeah , that 's what they all say when the polls stink . But maybe he should have listened , because 70 percent of the people were saying he was on the wrong track . It took a " thumping " on election day to wake him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't listening so much as he was calculating how to do a better job of convincing everyone he was right . // A leader has to be CREATIVE , go out on a limb , be willing to try something different . You know , think outside the box . George Bush prides himself on never changing , even as the world around him is spinning out of control . God forbid someone should accuse him of flip-flopping . There 's a disturbingly messianic fervor to his certainty . Senator Joe Biden recalled a conversation he had with Bush a few months after our troops marched into Baghdad . Joe was in the Oval Office outlining his concerns to the President  --  the explosive mix of Shiite and Sunni , the disbanded Iraqi army , the problems securing the oil fields . " The President was serene , " Joe recalled . " He told me he was sure that we were on the right course and that all would be well . ' Mr. President , ' I finally said , ' how can you be so sure when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bush then reached over and put a steadying hand on Joe 's shoulder . " My instincts , " he said . " My instincts . " Joe was flabbergasted . He told Bush , " Mr. President , your instincts are n't good enough . " Joe Biden sure did n't think the matter was settled . And , as we all know now , it was n't . // Leadership is all about managing change  --  whether you 're leading a company or leading a country . Things change , and you get creative . You adapt . Maybe Bush was absent the day they covered that at Harvard Business School . // A leader has to COMMUNICATE . I 'm not talking about running off at the mouth or spouting sound bites . I 'm talking about facing reality and telling the truth . Nobody in the current administration seems to know how to talk straight anymore . Instead , they spend most of their time trying to convince us that things are not really as bad as they seem . I do n't know if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive you crazy after a while . Communication has to start with telling the truth , even when it 's painful . The war in Iraq has been , among other things , a grand failure of communication . Bush is like the boy who did n't cry wolf when the wolf was at the door . After years of being told that all is well , even as the casualties and chaos mount , we 've stopped listening to him . // A leader has to be a person of CHARACTER . That means knowing the difference between right and wrong and having the guts to do the right thing . Abraham Lincoln once said , " If you want to test a man 's character , give him power . " George Bush has a lot of power . What does it say about his character ? Bush has shown a willingness to take bold action on the world stage because he has the power , but he shows little regard for the grievous consequences . He has sent our troops ( not to mention hundreds of thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? To build our oil reserves ? To avenge his daddy because Saddam Hussein once tried to have him killed ? To show his daddy he 's tougher ? The motivations behind the war in Iraq are questionable , and the execution of the war has been a disaster . A man of character does not ask a single soldier to die for a failed policy . // A leader must have COURAGE . I 'm talking about balls . ( That even goes for female leaders . ) Swagger is n't courage . Tough talk is n't courage . George Bush comes from a blue-blooded Connecticut family , but he likes to talk like a cowboy . You know , My gun is bigger than your gun . Courage in the twenty-first century does n't mean posturing and bravado . Courage is a commitment to sit down at the negotiating table and talk . // If you 're a politician , courage means taking a position even when you know it will cost you votes . Bush ca n't even make a public appearance unless the audience has been handpicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall meetings last year , in auditoriums packed with his most devoted fans . The questions were all softballs. // To be a leader you 've got to have CONVICTION  --  a fire in your belly . You 've got to have passion . You 've got to really want to get something done . How do you measure fire in the belly ? Bush has set the all-time record for number of vacation days taken by a U.S. President  --  four hundred and counting . He 'd rather clear brush on his ranch than immerse himself in the business of governing . He even told an interviewer that the high point of his presidency so far was catching a seven-and-a-half-pound perch in his hand-stocked lake . // It 's no better on Capitol Hill . Congress was in session only ninety-seven days in 2006 . That 's eleven days less than the record set in 1948 , when President Harry Truman coined the term do-nothing Congress . Most people would expect to be fired if they worked so little and had nothing to show for it . But Congress managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , that 's not leadership . // A leader should have CHARISMA . I 'm not talking about being flashy . Charisma is the quality that makes people want to follow you . It 's the ability to inspire . People follow a leader because they trust him . That 's my definition of charisma . Maybe George Bush is a great guy to hang out with at a barbecue or a ball game . But put him at a global summit where the future of our planet is at stake , and he does n't look very presidential . Those frat-boy pranks and the kidding around he enjoys so much do n't go over that well with world leaders . Just ask German Chancellor Angela Merkel , who received an unwelcome shoulder massage from our President at a G-8 Summit . When he came up behind her and started squeezing , I thought she was going to go right through the roof . // A leader has to be COMPETENT . That seems obvious , does n't it ? You 've got to know what you 're doing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself with people who know what they 're doing . Bush brags about being our first MBA President . Does that make him competent ? Well , let 's see . Thanks to our first MBA President , we 've got the largest deficit in history , Social Security is on life support , and we 've run up a half-a-trillion-dollar price tag ( so far ) in Iraq . And that 's just for starters . A leader has to be a problem solver , and the biggest problems we face as a nation seem to be on the back burner . // You ca n't be a leader if you do n't have COMMON SENSE . I call this Charlie Beacham 's rule . When I was a young guy just starting out in the car business , one of my first jobs was as Ford 's zone manager in Wilkes-Barre , Pennsylvania . My boss was a guy named Charlie Beacham , who was the East Coast regional manager . Charlie was a big Southerner , with a warm drawl , a huge smile , and a core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember , Lee , the only thing you 've got going for you as a human being is your ability to reason and your common sense . If you do n't know a dip of horseshit from a dip of vanilla ice cream , you 'll never make it . " George Bush does n't have common sense . He just has a lot of sound bites . You know  --  **99;479;TOOLONG Bush . // Former President Bill Clinton once said , " I grew up in an alcoholic home . I spent half my childhood trying to get into the reality-based world  --  and I like it here . " // I think our current President should visit the real world once in a while . // THE BIGGEST C IS CRISIS // Leaders are made , not born . Leadership is forged in times of crisis . It 's easy to sit there with your feet up on the desk and talk theory . Or send someone else 's kids off to war when you 've never seen a battlefield yourself . It 's another thing to lead when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2001 , we needed a strong leader more than any other time in our history . We needed a steady hand to guide us out of the ashes . Where was George Bush ? He was reading a story about a pet goat to kids in Florida when he heard about the attacks . He kept sitting there for twenty minutes with a baffled look on his face . It 's all on tape . You can see it for yourself . Then , instead of taking the quickest route back to Washington and immediately going on the air to reassure the panicked people of this country , he decided it was n't safe to return to the White House . He basically went into hiding for the day  --  and he told Vice President Dick Cheney to stay put in his bunker . We were all frozen in front of our TVs , scared out of our wits , waiting for our leaders to tell us that we were going to be okay , and there was nobody home . It took Bush a couple of days to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zero . // That was George Bush 's moment of truth , and he was paralyzed . And what did he do when he 'd regained his composure ? He led us down the road to Iraq  --  a road his own father had considered disastrous when he was President . But Bush did n't listen to Daddy . He listened to a higher father . He prides himself on being faith based , not reality based . If that does n't scare the crap out of you , I do n't know what will . // A HELL OF A MESS // So here 's where we stand . We 're immersed in a bloody war with no plan for winning and no plan for leaving . We 're running the biggest deficit in the history of the country . We 're losing the manufacturing edge to Asia , while our once-great companies are getting slaughtered by health care costs . Gas prices are skyrocketing , and nobody in power has a coherent energy policy . Our schools are in trouble . Our borders are like sieves . The middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times that cry out for leadership . // But when you look around , you 've got to ask : " Where have all the leaders gone ? " Where are the curious , creative communicators ? Where are the people of character , courage , conviction , competence , and common sense ? I may be a sucker for alliteration , but I think you get the point . // Name me a leader who has a better idea for homeland security than making us take off our shoes in airports and throw away our shampoo ? We 've spent billions of dollars building a huge new bureaucracy , and all we know how to do is react to things that have already happened . // Name me one leader who emerged from the crisis of Hurricane Katrina . Congress has yet to spend a single day evaluating the response to the hurricane , or demanding accountability for the decisions that were made in the crucial hours after the storm . Everyone 's hunkering down , fingers crossed , hoping it does n't happen again . Now , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Make a plan . Figure out what you 're going to do the next time . // Name me an industry leader who is thinking creatively about how we can restore our competitive edge in manufacturing . Who would have believed that there could ever be a time when " the Big Three " referred to Japanese car companies ? How did this happen  --  and more important , what are we going to do about it ? // Name me a government leader who can articulate a plan for paying down the debt , or solving the energy crisis , or managing the health care problem . The silence is deafening . But these are the crises that are eating away at our country and milking the middle class dry . // I have news for the gang in Congress . We did n't elect you to sit on your asses and do nothing and remain silent while our democracy is being hijacked and our greatness is being replaced with mediocrity . What is everybody so afraid of ? That some bobblehead on Fox News will call them a name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys show some spine for a change ? // HAD ENOUGH ? // Hey , I 'm not trying to be the voice of gloom and doom here . I 'm trying to light a fire . I 'm speaking out because I have hope . I believe in America . In my lifetime I 've had the privilege of living through some of America 's greatest moments . I 've also experienced some of our worst crises  --  the Great Depression , World War II , the Korean War , the Kennedy assassination , the Vietnam War , the 1970s oil crisis , and the struggles of recent years culminating with 9/11 . If I 've learned one thing , it 's this : You do n't get anywhere by standing on the sidelines waiting for somebody else to take action . Whether it 's building a better car or building a better future for our children , we all have a role to play . That 's the challenge I 'm raising in this book . It 's a call to action for people who , like me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's getting pretty close . So let 's shake off the horseshit and go to work . Let 's tell ' em all we 've had enough . //
