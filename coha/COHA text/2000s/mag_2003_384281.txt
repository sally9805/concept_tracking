Controversial genius Stephen Wolfram presses onward <p> Plenty of people claim to have theories that will revolutionize science . What 's rare is for other scientists to take one of these schemes seriously . Yet that 's what 's happened since May2002 when theoretical physicist Stephen Wolfram self-published a book in which he alleged to have found a new way to address the most difficult problems of science . Tellingly , he named this treatise A New Kind of Science . The book , which Wolfram sent to hundreds of journalists and influential scientists , sparked a firestorm of criticism . Detractors charged that the author was peddling speculations as discoveries , asserting that decades-old research was new , and pirating the research of others without giving due credit . Many commentators concluded that the author 's promise of a revolutionary upheaval in science was grandiose and unbelievable , even as they allowed that the book contained some incremental scientific discoveries , as well as intriguing ideas . <p> Fast-forward to this summer : Wolfram 's book is in its fifth 50,000-copy printing , despite being a $45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers have cited the book . Wolfram has hosted the first international conference on his work . <p> What 's going on ? Has the man discovered a secret that will cause science textbooks to he rewritten or merely found a formula for mass-marketing science  --  or something in between ? Science News takes a look at Wolfram 's enterprise 15 months after the book 's debut . <p> EQUATION EVASION At the heart of Wolfram 's work is the observation that extremely simple computer programs can generate patterns of extraordinary complexity . Among such programs are a type known as cellular automata , which scientists have studied for 50 years ( SN : 7/3/99 , p.8 ) . <p> To understand what a cellular automaton is , consider a sheet of graph paper on which a pattern can be marked by darkening selected boxes . The top row may have one or more boxes blackened . A simple cellular automaton draws a pattern by beginning with the second row and working its way down the page . <p> As it considers each box in a row , the automaton observes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher box . Then , on the basis of a specific rule that depends on which , if any , of those three boxes are dark , the automaton blackens its current box or leaves it blank  --  and moves on . <p> Most simple cellular automata generate boring , repetitive patterns . However , one day more than 20 years ago , Wolfram was observing the behavior of a cellular automaton known as Rule 30 when the program created an unpredictable pattern of stunning complexity on a computer printout . That event began a journey of discovery , Wolfram says , that ultimately led him to realize that elementary computer programs offer a way to solve problems in many branches of science without the drudgery and limitations of conventional equations and equation-based simulations . <p> Although equations have formed the foundation of math and theoretical science for centuries , they often become insoluble when applied to complex phenomena . By contrast , Wolfram contends , simple , complexity-generating programs are the tools of " a new kind of science " that , more accurately and easily than the old one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snowflakes to the workings of the universe . <p> According to Wolfram , this style of simulation will be successful because it mimics how the universe works : Computational processes underlie phenomena from elementary particle interactions to life . <p> Wolfram has spun off a lot of exhilarating ideas about where this new approach can lead . For example , rather than needing Darwinian evolution to explain the complexity of living creatures ( SN : 6/10/00 , p. 382 ) , Wolfram says that a biological computation process based on a few simple rules could do the trick . In physics , Wolfram 's approach suggests that space itself may not be a continuous entity but rather some sort of network of interconnected fragments . The unpredictability of patterns generated by simple programs , he and music . Attendees came from as far away as Norway , Israel , says , explains how people can exercise free will while their brains obey strict physical laws . <p> Although Wolfram calls his approach a new kind of science , some elements of it , such as cellular automata , have been investigated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier theories of fractals ( SN : 2/2/02 , p.75 ) , of chaos ( SN : 10/31/98 , p.285 ) , and of complexity theory ( SN : 5/6/00 , p.296 ) . In fact , Wolfram has in the past made notable contributions to research on cellular automata and complexity . <p> For that reason among others , the man behind A New Kind of Science is n't easily labeled a crackpot . A British-born prodigy , he received a Ph.D . in theoretical physics from the California Institute of Technology at age 20 and won a MacArthur Foundation " genius " award 2 years later , in 1981 , for his work in physics and computing . Later , he created Mathematica , a software package for scientists , engineers and mathematicians , and developed it into a highly profitable business  --  Wolfram Research of Champaign , Ill.  --  which he still leads . <p> Because of Wolfram 's credentials , heavy hitters of science and technology have paid attention to his book , though not necessarily praised it . In the New York Review of Books last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Texas at Austin concluded that Wolfram had written a " failure " albeit " an interesting one . " Weinberg found that " not one realworld complex phenomenon ... has been convincingly explained by Wolfram 's computer experiments . " Still , he added , Wolfram may have taken a first step toward a much needed theory of complexity <p> A critique by inventor and artificial intelligence pioneer Ray Kurzweil of Kurzweil Technologies in Wellesley Hills , Mass. , hails Wolfram 's work as a " tour de force " on the topic of cellular automata . Nonetheless , Kurzweil says that Wolfram seriously overstated the complexity that simple programs produce . On the topic of living organisms , for instance , Kurzweil asserts that unless factors beyond simple rules are invoked , one ca n't explain " insects or humans or Chopin preludes . " <p> Fans of Wolfram 's work say that much of the negative reaction has stemmed more from the author 's self-aggrandizing writing style than from his science . For instance , Wolfram says in his book , " I have discovered vastly more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have now done touches almost every existing area of science , and quite a bit besides . " <p> Fans look beyond his habit of frequently and brashly proclaiming the historic importance of his findings . " I believe that some of the ideas in A New Kind of Science are going to be very valuable to us in developing predictive models , " says medical researcher Elaine L. Bearer of Brown University in Providence , Rd . <p> RITE OF ASSEMBLY Compared with the harsh treatment Wolfram endured from many reviewers last year , the recent conference on his work was a love fest . More than 200 men and women , paying up to $325 apiece , attended the event June 26-29 at a hotel in Waltham , Mass . They ranged from college students to retirees and represented an eclectic mix of professions and interests , including physics , biology , psychology , medicine , computer science , engineering , economics , business , art , and Australia . <p> Some people said they were drawn by their admiration for Wolfram ; others , by the allure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . <p> " This guy is the closest thing to Isaac Newton in 350 years " says Stanley Ruby , a physicist who retired from Stanford ( Calif . ) Linear Accelerator Center 9 years ago . " I think he 's onto something hugely important . " <p> Others , like Carl E. Lippitt of Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque , came looking for help with applying Wolfram 's concepts to engineering designs . <p> For instance , Lippitt and his Sandia colleagues are exploring control schemes for proposed battlefield robots that would aid soldiers , for example by carrying extra gear . Because the battlefield is such a complex environment , those robots would require intricate behavioral repertoires . That 's where Wolfram 's ideas of generating complexity from simplicity seem to fit in , Lippitt says . Yet Lippitt could n't find in Wolfram 's book guidance for developing practical devices . <p> " It 's somewhat difficult to understand , from an engineering perspective , how you go about implementing these ideas , " Lippitt says . <p> During the wo-and-a-half-day " minicourse " Wolfram did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lectures  --  although there were a few panel discussions . <p> The meeting was too one-sided , says mathematician and science fiction author Rudy Rucker of San Jose ( Calif . ) State University even though he 's a fan and friend of Wolfram 's . " It would be a better conference if somebody besides Stephen was organizing it . Then it could be more of a full spectrum " of opinions , he says . <p> Kurzweil Tech 's vice president of business development Celia Black-Brooks says the meetings science was over her head , but she had no trouble appreciating the business savvy of Wolfram 's firm . " He certainly has a well-oiled marketing machine behind him " she adds . <p> Wolfram unveiled no new developments in his own work at the conference because there have n't been any to speak of since the book was finished , he told Science News . He says he 's been too busy giving talks at campuses and laboratories , responding to the 30,000 or so e-mails prompted by the book , and striving to build a scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be another year before he can get back to the science . On the other hand , at the conference 's poster session , about 10 of the conference goers unveiled projects in which they had used Wolfram 's style of computer modeling to explore areas as diverse as explosion dynamics , quantum mechanics , data visualization , and cultural identity . <p> Among those projects was a cellular automaton created by physicist Larry G. Hill of Los Alamos ( N.M. ) National Laboratory . The algorithm yields an animation that may mark the first step toward realistic computer models of explosions caused by superheated liquids , Hill says . The dynamics of those fluids have proved too complex for today 's conventional equation-based simulations , he adds . <p> In another project , electrical engineer Rodrigo G. Obando of Fairfield ( Conn . ) University statistically analyzed cellular automata patterns and translated the results into three-dimensional forms resembling disks , bowls , and hats . Comparing the shapes of those forms may reveal relative degrees of symmetry , complexity and randomness of automata patterns , Obando says . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associates are moving ahead on other fronts to foster a new scientific movement . <p> At the meeting  --  which planners say will be repeated next year  --  Wolfram distributed a booklet summarizing more than 170 problems and projects that he considers next steps for the field that he has launched : for instance , to " develop automated ways to find ' interesting ' cellular automata " and to consider " what might history have been like if cellular automata had been investigated in antiquity . " <p> Wolfram also announced the start of an online clearinghouse for related research ( http : //atlas.wolfram.com ) and to found an institute devoted to the approach . What 's more , he said he 's planning to transform Complex Systems , a journal that he founded in 1987 , into the flagship publication for the new field . <p> Although the scientific establishment has largely rejected Wolfram 's revolution , academia features a few courses on the topic . For instance , San Jose State 's Rucker has been teaching a graduate course on it since the fall of 2002 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early July at Brown University . <p> " One of the things universities should do is to be a home for ideas that are controversial , whose long-term potential is uncertain , and that generate a lot of interest and excitement " says Brown 's provost , mathematician Robert J. Zimmer . He invited the Wolfram program onto the campus after a Wolfram talk at the school last October proved so popular that people had to be turned away . <p> One effect of Wolfram 's campaign for a new science has been to intensify interest in some longstanding ideas that do n't mesh with prevailing theories . For instance , in the early 1980s , Edward Fredkin originated the idea that the universe itself may be a cellular automaton and that energy and mass are just information ( SN : 8/2/97 , p. 76 ) . In Fredkin 's model , both space and time are grainy rather than continuous , so space is permeated with exquisitely small , discrete cells whose states change at extremely brief , discrete intervals , just as patterns generated by computers ' cellular automata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Pittsburgh , complains that Wolfram has taken credit for some of his ideas . At the same time , he says , his now-famous friend and rival has " done me a favor because a lot more people are interested in what I do because of Wolfram 's notoriety . " <p> Wolfram says he 's pleased with the his enterprise 's progress , which is " a little ahead of schedule . " Looking ahead , he predicts that the " first round of serious extensions to the book " will come in 2 to 3 years . <p> To skeptics and enthusiasts alike , Wolfram readily declares that the revolution has begun . Nonetheless , " it 's going to be a while " he admits  --  another 10 years or so  --  before his approach will take the place he thinks it deserves at the forefront of science . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ARTFUL AUTOMATION  --  The pattern from Rute 110  --  a simple computer algorithm known as a cellular automation  --  looks orderly in this initial rows but grows extraordinary complex .
