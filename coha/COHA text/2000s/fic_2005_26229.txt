Chapter One Poppy and Rye Visit Ereth " Sugared slug soup , " said Ereth the porcupine without looking up from the lump of salt over which he was slobbering . " I do n't believe it . " " I 'm afraid it 's true , " said the deer mouse Poppy to her old friend . " It 's very upsetting . The kind of thing that makes me wonder if I 've been a bad parent . " Poppy and her husband , Rye , a golden mouse , had gone over to Ereth 's smelly hollow log for a talk . The closest of friends , they lived deep within Dimwood Forest , where the tall trees reached into the sweet air and carpeted the earth below with soft shadows . " Now Poppy , " said Rye , " the rest of our children are doing fine . " Poppy sighed . " I suppose one failure out of a litter of eleven is n't bad , " she said . Her round , white belly had grown plump of late . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now those eyes appeared rather dull and full of worry , while her whiskers were somewhat limp . " You made your first mistake by naming him Ragweed Junior , " Ereth grumbled between licks of salt . " Most juniors , " he said , " resent the name . Or should . " " I wish he did resent it , " said Poppy . " Junior 's problem is that he loves being a new Ragweed . " " Gangrenous gym shorts , " said Ereth . " Was there ever a mouse  --  dead or alive  --  who caused more fuss than the first Ragweed ? " " I 'm afraid , " said Rye , " Junior wants to be what he thinks Ragweed was . It 's all those stories he 's heard about my brother . " " Though of course , " Poppy said , " Junior never knew Ragweed . All he knows is that Ragweed was unusual . " She reached out , took Rye 's paw , and squeezed it with affection . " It was Ragweed who brought us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she reminded Ereth , " I doubt you and I would have met . " " I suppose , " said Ereth . He put his salt lump down reluctantly . " Just what the flea fudge has Junior done ? " " He used to be a cheerful , chatty , wonderfully open young mouse , " said Poppy . " Nowadays it 's a constant frown . " " If I say yes , " Rye went on , pulling at his long whiskers , " he says no . If I say no , he says yes . When he says anything more than that , it 's mostly Leave me alone . ' " " He has become rather rude , " said Poppy . " Almost impossible to get him out of bed before noon , " added Rye . " I doubt , " said Poppy , " that he washes his face more than once a week , even though he 's constantly being reminded . " Her own ears were large and dark , with a nose , toes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's completely changed his looks , " said Rye , whose fur was dark orange . " Looks ! " barked Ereth . " How can a mouse change his looks ? " " You see , " said Rye , with a shake of his head and a whisk of his tail , " Junior 's best friend is a skunk . " The salt fell from Ereth 's paws . " A skunk ? " " His name is Mephitis , " Poppy explained . " We do n't know much about him . Or his family . I 'm afraid the problem is that he 's not a very good influence . Ereth , you need to see Junior for yourself . " " Oh , toe jam on a toothpick , " said Ereth . " He ca n't be that bad . " " The point is , " said Poppy , " Junior has become a teenager . " " A teenager ! " cried the porcupine . " Why the weasel wonk did you let that happen ? " " He did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears cocked forward . " Then I 'd better go unbuckle his buttons , " said Ereth . With a rattle of his quills , he heaved himself up . " Where is he ? " " Probably down among the snag roots , " said Rye . " He 's taken to liking darkness , too . " " Just watch me , putt pockets , " said Ereth . " I 'll straighten him out flatter than a six-lane highway rolling through Death Valley . Be back soon . But do n't touch that salt , or you 'll get a quill up your snoot . " Quills rattling , the porcupine clumped out of the old log and headed for the gray lifeless and topless tree in which Poppy and her family made their home . " Good luck , " Rye called after him . " I do hope it was all right to tell Ereth about Junior , " said Poppy . " Nothing else has worked , " said Rye . " But . . . what do you think he 'll do ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll find out pretty soon . " Continues ...
