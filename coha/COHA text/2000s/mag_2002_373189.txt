The Bush White House is strictly **31;14822;TOOLONG , an outfit run by corporate bosses : Dick Cheney from Halliburton , the oil-services giant ; Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill from Alcoa ; and Commerce Secretary Don Evans from the Denver oil-and-gas outfit Tom Brown . These are capitalists who know how to make a buck and were never ashamed of it . <P> They never had to be , until the corporate trust scandals landed on the President and Vice President like a sack of nickels . At issue is whether the two men benefited during their business careers from the same kind of cronyism and slippery accounting that the Administration is now publicly condemning . The day before Bush was scheduled to deliver a speech meant to spank Wall Street , he held a press conference to advertise his standing as a Main Street kind of guy . He wanted to show small investors , says an aide , that he " shared their outrage . " <P> But once the questions began , Bush looked like a 5-year-old losing a battle with an ice-cream cone on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Harken Energy in 1990 , a once scrutinized deal that had faded into obscurity , was now alive in a much less forgiving environment . Bush dumped $848,000 worth of Harken stock two months before the company announced a $23.2 million loss ; he was 34 weeks late in filing a form the Securities and Exchange Commission required to record the sale . Old news , the President said , noting that the SEC investigated the sale and took no action . <P> Bush 's business dealings were legal but on the wrong side of the new corporate morality he is now preaching . How could the President chastise executives for doing the same kinds of things he did as a director , without apology ? Bush received subsidized loans from Harken to buy company stock  --  a practice he now wants to ban . In 1989 Harken concealed losses by selling most of a subsidiary to an off-the-books entity controlled by company insiders . Bush was on the audit committee , which , at least in theory , approved the deal . It 's the same tactic used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it imploded . <P> As Bush struggled to explain away the past , Cheney was being investigated by the SEC and sued by Halliburton shareholders and the conservative activist group Judicial Watch . The allegation : that Halliburton , while Cheney was CEO , greased the books to boost the firm 's flagging fortunes . Its decline was due in part to Cheney 's signature strategic move  --  Halliburton 's merger with Dresser Industries in 1998 , when Dresser was about to be buried under asbestos-contamination lawsuits . Halliburton remains burdened with the liability of more than 200,000 suits and as of last year was on the hook for $125 million in settlements . Its stock has fallen from nearly $60 to about $13.50 , imperiling the retirement savings of blue-collar workers . ( Cheney cashed in his Halliburton stock options before taking office , clearing more than $20 million before the shares tanked. )
