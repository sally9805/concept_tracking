<p> So many people who jumped on the flag-flying bandwagon after 9/11 have , apparently , no idea that it is disrespectful to fly a flag that looks as though it has been run through a shredder . New flags are not expensive , folks , and if you are unwilling to pony up the few bucks for a new one now and then , just take the darn thing down . <p> Worse , though , are the Streets and Sanitation Department trucks I have been noticing lately , bearing ( they are in such horrible shape that " flying " is n't really possible anymore ) flags that are grayed , tattered , threadbare and tangled around the antenna to which they are attached . I approached a passenger in one of these trucks and told him that it was a shame to see a city vehicle with such a badly deteriorated flag . He replied , " Yeah , well , that flag 's been on there a long time . " My point exactly . <p> Mayor Daley , please : Instruct city workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flags . It speaks ill of the City of Chicago to be so disrespectful of our flag . And shame on the workers who do n't care . <p> M. J. Tala , Near North Side <p> A story from the Associated Press in the April 9 Sun-Times about the share of the federal income tax burden that falls on the wealthy was remarkably slanted . It quoted only one source , the Tax Foundation , a " non-partisan tax education and research group " that happens , according to its Web page ( www.taxfoundation.org ) , to support the vast majority of the provisions of President Bush 's ill-advised tax cuts of last year . <p> The foundation 's executive director , Scott Hodge , said , " It 's very easy to move into the top echelon of taxpayers . " I 'd love to have him explain how that is , with the minimum wage offering less than half the purchasing power it did 40 years ago , and anti-union policies continuing to drive government . <p> The reality is that the tax burden has for 20 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As income tax rates have been cut , especially for those with higher incomes , more of the tax burden has been levied through sales taxes , energy taxes , utility taxes and payroll taxes . The poor pay a disproportionate share of those taxes . <p> Yes , the rich pay a larger percentage of the total income tax than the middle class and poor . Perhaps if the reporter had bothered to check with a truly non-partisan source , he might have learned why the rich pay more of that particular tax . Maybe he would have learned that the top 1 percent of taxpayers are vastly , incomprehensibly wealthier than the rest of the citizenry . <p> Maybe he would even have come around to my position : They 're still not paying enough . <p> Levi Stahl , Uptown <p> The real crisis in the Middle East and the world at large is reflected in a letter , " Regional stupidity , " April 10 , in which the author recommends suing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and the families of suicide bombers as a way to end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the families and Saddam Hussein would be unenforceable and uncollectible , the author misses the vast cultural difference between Western and some Arab and Muslim cultures . <p> Western culture is based on laws that value personal liberties and freedoms while protecting us from inhumane and cruel punishments when we break those laws . Arab and Muslin cultures also have laws . Under some of those laws , a person can be denied an education , the freedom to be seen in public and to have a fair and open trial judged by peers when they break the law . They can be " lawfully " punished for not strictly adhering to religious doctrines . <p> Many people have condemned Israel for its incursions into the West Bank and Gaza in an attempt to defend itself . What Israel recognizes and the rest of the world must admit , is that although many hundreds of millions of Arabs and Muslims are peace-loving and harbor no ill will toward Western culture , some of their leaders can stay in power only by blaming others for the hardships they have imposed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own children in harm 's way in an attempt to chop the heads off groups who are killing its citizens , while trying not to harm innocent Palestinians . Unfortunately , in war there are civilian causalities . <p> There are no easy solutions to peace in the Middle East . If we really want peace in the Middle East and want the " rule of law " to apply globally , we first have to wean ourselves off oil . By doing so , we cut off the billions of dollars keeping some of the current Arab and Muslim leaders in power . This in turn allows them to suppress their own people , instilling hate and directing it toward others . <p> By John Bobek 's reasoning , we simply should have sued Osama bin Laden , sending " a good battalion of lawyers " to Afghanistan instead of troops . <p> Joel L. Friedman , <p> Norwood Park <p> I know that we Americans have ridiculously short attention spans , and I know that it is the media 's job to keep the public alarmed , informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but something has been bothering me for the last couple weeks or so . Why has the coverage on Osama bin Laden all but disappeared from our airwaves ? <p> I have noticed that the spotlight has gradually moved from bin Laden to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan to the reconstruction of that country to larger conflicts in the Middle East that have little or nothing to do with the original story and search for the man responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks . <p> These stories are much appreciated . Yet I feel as though the media use them as smokescreens to distract the average person from the possibility that our military and media have no idea where the fugitive bin Laden is hiding . <p> The people deserve to know if any or no developments are being made in bringing this man to justice . Months ago the media had the American populace screaming for justice . Today it is as if the entire event is almost forgotten . We should be vigilant , and the media should help the American people in doing so . <p> Carlos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded daily of the bravery of our men and women in the armed services and fire and police departments , there are men and women who daily put their lives on the line with the simple act of showing up for work . I am referring to the men and women who work in U.S. embassies throughout the world . <p> Recently , our embassy in Peru was the scene of a deadly terrorist attack . It appears that every two-bit terrorist has declared open season on Americans , perhaps buoyed by the events of Sept. 11 . Embassy employees have been told to avoid taking the same route to work each day ; to not congregate in groups ; to avoid spending leisure time in establishments frequented by other Americans and to avoid wearing any displays of patriotism . <p> The next time you get ready to leave the house for work , take a moment to think of your fellow Americans in U.S. embassies throughout the world and try to imagine what they face each day . <p> Geoff Kelly , Near North Side <p> Every time one sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yes , scores of Palestinian warriors and ordinary citizens dead , we need to remind ourselves that the planes , guns , tanks and all the other weapons of war came from American taxpayers . The Palestinians and other Arab nations are aware of this . <p> We need to remember , too , that there are Americans without hospital insurance and seniors unable to afford the medicine necessary to keep them alive . There also are children without clothing , food and medical care . Other parents have children who have to be nurtured by strangers because of low wages . But the federal government has placed more importance on the defense of Israel , to the disadvantage of many of our own people . <p> If the $2 billion-plus annual giveaway was so necessary , maybe we should have stipulated by side letter that the arms were not to be used without our permission . One does n't have to be a history buff to understand the long hate between these stepbrother nations . Why do n't we see that ? <p> It is almost impossible for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their enemy  --  posing as the peacemaker . We have gotten ourselves into deep water . <p> Marvin Balousek , Matteson <p> Regarding the proposed increase in tolls for the Illinois Tollway : My home is in the south suburbs , and Interstate 294 is the only realistic way for me to reach my place of employment near O'Hare Airport in Rosemont . Along with the considerable costs of auto ownership and maintenance , insurance and gasoline , I currently pay $600 a year in tolls , while those on Interstates 55 , 90 , 94 and 290 travel for free . With the increase , I will face an annual cost of $975 as I pass through three toll booths on the way to work and three on the return home . <p> The proposed increase to 75 cents from 40 cents is an 87.5 percent boost . As an I-Pass user , I still face a possible increase to 65 cents ( a 62.5 percent increase ) . This is absurd , as well as unfair to taxpayers who help pay for other roads as well as paying tolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleading for our government representatives and all concerned to take any and all action they can to stop the tollway authority from raising its tax . <p> G. Baker , Crestwood <p> Chicago Public Schools CEO Arne Duncan and School Board President Michael Scott showed their contempt for Chicago Teachers Union President Deborah Lynch in their comment in Sunday 's April 14 news article " Taking the ' anti-Vallas ' road . " <p> Lynch was justifiably furious over Duncan 's plan to close three schools , claiming that he had told her in February that no schools would be closed this fall . Scott was quoted as saying : " When she calms down , we 're going to pursue it with her . " <p> They most likely looked at each other with a " what else but a hissy fit did you expect from a woman ? " smile . It 's her job , boys , remember ? <p> Joan Bjorklund , <p> Ravenswood Manor
