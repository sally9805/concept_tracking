WHAT 'S NEXT <P> " All the futuristic advancements conceivable will amount to nothing if we fail to address the problems that are here and now . " ANN LARSON Reno , Nev . <P> After reading your forecasts for the future and Lev Grossman 's article " The Quest for Cool " WHAT 'S NEXT , Sept. 8 , I 've concluded that I have never been cool , I have no desire to ever be cool , and those who think they are cool really are n't . ROB NANCE Westerville , Ohio <P> The professional trend spotters you interviewed tell us that burlesque will be cool , we will do everything from our cars , and cell phones will be the means for transactions of all types . If this is the cool future , then send me back to the square past ! Of course , almost 40 years ago , Paul Revere and the Raiders sang that " kicks just keep getting harder to find . " The youth of every generation has its moments of temporary insanity , but for any society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine awareness of and respect for the past . If we Americans keep pushing the envelope in an increasingly outrageous quest for the ultimate , cutting-edge in cool , then I 'm afraid our future will take us down the same path of decadence chosen by great societies that are now only history . BARBARA ISENBERG Royal Palm Beach , Fla . <P> Predictions of future trends reminded me of my college days in the late ' 50s . We were told that by the end of the 20th century , we would all be working a three-day week and our biggest problem would be finding something to do with all our spare time . DAVID R. REAGAN Allen , Texas <P> The cool your trend spotters talked about is the cool that MTV and the teen media are trying to shove down the throat of mainstream America . One of your experts surveyed young people in shopping malls to find out what is and is n't cool . Once something is mass-marketed and available in malls everywhere , it has lost its edge . I 'm not cool , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest trend simply because it is the latest trend . MATTHEW CARUSO Valencia Calif . <P> Is it not painfully obvious , even tragic , that our obsession with " what 's next " denies us a full appreciation of the special moments that are happening now ? JOHN R. THURSTON Eau Claire , Wis . <P> If the so-called trend spotters sell their insights in newsletters for thousands of dollars , I 'd like to check some back issues to find out how accurate they have been . Perhaps a review would show that the clued in are really clueless . Anyone want to buy a cool bridge ? SID KASKEY South Miami , Fla . <P> Give the Armor to Arnold <P> " Coming Attractions " reported that Brad Pitt will portray the great warrior Achilles in Troy , the new film version of The Iliad WHAT 'S NEXT : ARTS , Sept. 8 . Please say it is n't so ! I 'd rather see Arnold Schwarzenegger as Achilles and Pitt as a candidate for California Governor .
