Nobody told me about the poison oak . Oh , they told me about the palm trees . Yeah , they told me plenty about the palm trees , all right . But nobody ever said a word about this poison oak business . " The thing is , Susannah --  " Father Dominic was talking to me . I was trying to pay attention , but let me tell you something : poison oak itches . " As mediators -- which is what we are , you and I , Susannah -- we have a responsibility . We have a responsibility to give aid and solace to those unfortunate souls who are suffering in the void between the living and the dead . " I mean , yeah , the palm trees are nice and everything . It had been cool to step off the plane and see those palm trees everywhere , especially since I 'd heard how cold it can get at night in northern California . But what is the deal with this poison oak ? How come nobody ever warned me about that ? " You see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help lost souls get to where they are supposed to be going . We are their guides , as it were . Their spiritual liaisons between this world and the next . " Father Dominic fingered an unopened pack of cigarettes that was sitting on his desk , and regarded me with those big old baby blues of his . " But when one 's spiritual liaison takes one 's head and slams it into a locker door . . . well , you can see how that kind ofbehavior might not build the sort of trust we 'd like to establish with our troubled brothers and sisters . " I looked up from the rash on my hands . Rash . That was n't even the word for it . It was like a fungus . Worse than a fungus , even . It was a growth . An insidious growth that , given time , would consume every inch of my once smooth , unblemished skin , covering it with red , scaly bumps . That oozed , by the way . " Yeah , " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us a hard time , I do n't see why it 's such a crime if I just haul off and slug them in the --  " " But do n't you see , Susannah ? " Father Dominic clenched the pack of cigarettes . I 'd only known him a couple of weeks , but whenever he started fondling his cigarettes -- which he never , by the way , actually smoked -- it meant he was upset about something . That something , at this particular moment , appeared to be me . " That is why , " he explained , " you 're called a mediator . You are supposed to be helping to bring these troubled souls to spiritual fulfillment --  " " Look , Father Dom , " I said . I tucked my oozing hands out of sight . " I do n't know what kind of ghosts you 've been dealing with lately , but the ones I 've been running into are about as likely to find spiritual fulfillment as I 'm going to find a decent New York City-style slice of pizza in this town . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hell or they 're going to heaven or they 're going on to their next life as a caterpillar in Kathmandu , but any way you slice it , sometimes they 're gon na need a little kick in the butt to get them there . . . . " " No , no , no . " Father Dominic leaned forward . He could n't lean forward too much because a week or so before , one of those troubled souls of his had decided to forgo spiritual enlightenment and tried to snap his leg off instead . She also broke a couple of his ribs , gave him a pretty nifty concussion , tore up the school real good , and , let 's see , what else ? Oh , yeah . She tried to kill me . Father Dominic was back at school , but he was wearing a cast that went all the way down to his toes , and disappeared up his long black robe , who knew how far ? Personally , I did n't like to think about it . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could chase the late kids up and down the halls if he had to . But since he was the principal , and it was up to the novices to hand out late slips , he did n't have to . Besides , Father Dom was pretty cool , and would n't do something like that even if he could . Though he takes the whole ghost thing a little too seriously , if you ask me . " Susannah , " he said , tiredly . " You and I , for better or for worse , were born with an incredible gift -- an ability to see and speak to the dead . " " There you go again , " I said , rolling my eyes , " with that gift stuff . Frankly , Father , I do n't see it that way . " How could I ? Since the age of two -- two years old -- I 've been pestered with , pounded on , plagued by restless spirits . For fourteen years , I 've put up with their abuse , helping them when I could , punching them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out my secret and revealing me to be the biological freak I 've always known I am , but have tried so desperately to hide from my sweet , long-suffering mother . And then Mom remarried and moved me out to California -- in the middle of my sophomore year , thanks very much -- where , wonder of wonders , I 'd actually met someone cursed with the same horrible affliction : Father Dominic . Only Father Dominic refuses to view our " gift " in the same light as me . To him , it 's a marvelous opportunity to help others in need . Yeah , okay . That 's fine for him . He 's a priest . He 's not a sixteen-year-old girl who , hello , would like to have a social life . If you ask me , a " gift " would have some plus side to it . Like superhuman strength or the ability to read minds , or something . But I do n't have any of that cool stuff . I 'm just an ordinary sixteen-year-old girl -- well , okay , with above ordinary looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to converse with the dead . Big deal . " Susannah , " he said now , very seriously . " We are mediators . We are n't . . . well , terminators . Our duty is to intervene on the spirits ' behalf , and lead them to their ultimate destination . We do that by gentle guidance and counseling , not by punching them in the face or by performing Brazilian voodoo exorcisms . " Continues ...
