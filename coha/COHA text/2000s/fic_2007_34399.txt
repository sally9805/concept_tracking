Chapter One Angel Mary Clare Bradford , Angie to her friends , looked over at her assistant , who was stacking rolls of colored ribbon onto spindles . Satisfied that the rolls of ribbon were aligned to match the spindles of wrapping paper , she turned away to survey her domain . The **26;610;TOOLONG room with its own lavatory was neat as a pin because Angie Bradford was a tidy person . The room she and her assistant , Bess Kelly , were standing in was known as the Eagle Department Store gift wrap department . Eva Bradford , Angie 's mother , had a lifetime lease on this very room , thanks to retired owner Angus Eagle , something that rankled the current young department store head , Josh Eagle , Angus 's heir . Angie and Josh had gone to the mat via the legal system on several occasions . Josh wanted the lease canceled so he could open a safari clothing department . He claimed the paltry , **28;638;TOOLONG rent Angie paid for the gift wrap space was depriving the Eagle Department Store of serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been of sound mind when he signed the ridiculous lifetime lease . Angie countered with a startling video of Angus playing tennis and being interviewed by the New York Times talking about politics and his philanthropic endeavors on the very day he signed the lifetime lease . In a separate filing , Angie charged Josh Eagle was a bully , and presented sworn testimony that he repeatedly turned off the electricity in the gift shop as well as the water in the lavatory just to harass her . On occasion the heat and air conditioning were also turned off . Usually on the coldest and hottest days of the year . Josh retaliated by saying Angie should pay for the electricity , water , heat , and air-conditioning . He said there were no free lunches in the Eagle Department Store in Woodbridge , New Jersey . Judge Atkins had glared at the two adversaries and barked his decision : Josh Eagle was not to step within 150 feet of the gift wrap department . Angie was to pay an additional thirty-dollars-a-month rent for the utilities , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense . At that point the Eagle-Bradford war escalated to an all-time high , with both sides doing double-time to outwit the other . The present score was zip-zip . " So , are you going to the store meeting or not ? " Bess asked as she gathered up her purse and jacket . " Nope . I do n't work for Josh Eagle or this store . I work for my mother . I 'm just renting space from Eagle 's . It was toasty in here today , was n't it ? " Angie asked . It had been unseasonably cool for September . Bess eyed her young employer and laughed . She 'd worked for Eva Bradford for twelve years before Eva turned the business over to her daughter , 110 pounds of energy who was full of spit and vinegar , five years ago . Angie had jumped right into the business , played David to Josh 's Goliath , and come out a winner . At least in Bess 's eyes . With the Christmas season fast approaching , Bess knew in her gut that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to get under Angie 's skin and make her life so miserable she would give up and move out . She laughed silently . Josh Eagle did n't know the Angie Bradford she knew . " Come on , boss , I 'll walk you out to the parking lot . How 's Eva today ? " Angie slipped into her jacket and hung her purse on her shoulder before she turned off the lights . She pressed a switch , and a colorful corrugated blind came down , totally covering the entrance to the gift wrap department . She waited a moment until she heard the sound of the lock slipping into place . She 'd installed the sliding panel at her own expense , much to Josh Eagle 's chagrin . She then locked the walkthrough door to the gift wrap department . Not just any old lock , this was a special lock that Josh Eagle could n't open with the store 's master keys . She 'd also installed her own security system with the ADT firm . Josh had taken her to court on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying Angie was protecting her investment and as long as she was n't asking him to pay for her security , there was no problem . Back then the score had been one-zip . " Uh-oh , look who 's standing by that big red X you painted on the floor ! " Angie looked ahead of her to see Josh Eagle glaring at her . " You 're late ! " He was good-looking , she had to give him that . And he had dimples . Right now his dark brown eyes were spewing sparks . He was dressed in a power suit and tie , his shirt so blinding white , it had to be new . It was all about image with Josh Eagle . Angie looked down at her watch . " Actually , I 'm leaving right on time , Mr. Eagle . My lights are off , the heat has been turned down , the security system locked and loaded , and my door is locked . It 's one minute past six . The store closes at six . " " I called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means you 're supposed to be in the conference room promptly at six-ten . You 're still standing here , Ms. Bradford . What 's wrong with this picture ? Well ? " Angie sighed . " How many times do I have to tell you , Mr. Eagle ? I do not work for you . Judge Atkins sent you papers to that effect . I have copies in case you lost yours . What part of **30;668;TOOLONG do n't you understand ? " Josh Eagle looked like he was about to say something , then changed his mind . Angie started walking again , and when she got to Josh and he did n't move , she stiff-armed him . " You touched my person , " Josh said dramatically as he pretended to back away . " Will you get off it already ! Do you sit up there in your ivory tower and dream up ways to torment me ? I did not touch you . I put my arm out so you would n't touch me . In case your vision is impaired , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my way and do n't come down here again with your silly demands . This shop is off-limits to you ! " " Just a damn minute , Ms. Bradford . If you want to go to court again , I 'm your man . I want to know what you 're going to do about wrapping my customers ' Christmas gifts this year . That 's the main topic to be discussed at tonight 's meeting . " " We 've had this same discussion every September for the past five years . You had the same discussion with my mother for the five years prior to my arrival , and the outcome has always been the same . This year is no different . Pay me to wrap your customers ' gifts , and we 're in business . If you do n't pay me , I can not help you . I 'm in business to make money just the way you are . Try to wrap your feeble brain around that fact , then get back to me or have your lawyer call my lawyer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool evening air , Angie dusted her hands together . " I thought that went rather well . " She sniffed the air . " Someone 's burning leaves . Oh , I just love that smell . " Bess opened her car door . " I think you enjoy tormenting that man . I agree he 's sorely lacking in the charm department , but my mother always told me you can get more flies with honey than vinegar . The guy 's a hottie , that 's for sure . " " Ha ! Eye candy . The man has no substance , he 's all veneer . On top of that , he 's greedy and obnoxious . With all that going against him , I wonder how he manages to charm that string of women he parades around all the time , " Angie sniffed . " His money charms them . Josh Eagle is considered a good catch . You know , Angie , you could throw your line in the pond . You reel him in , and all this , " Bess said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the department store , " could be yours ! " Angie started to laugh and could n't stop . " Not in this life time . See you tomorrow , Bess . " " Tell your mother I said hello . " " Will do , " Angie called over her shoulder . Angie sat in her car for ten minutes while she played the scene that had just transpired back in the store over and over in her mind . Would Josh Eagle drag her into court again ? Probably . The man had a hate on for her that was so over-the-top she could no longer comprehend it . In the beginning she 'd handled it the way she handled every challenge that came her way : fairly and honestly . She fought to win , and so far she 'd won every round . Remembering the look on Josh Eagle 's face , she wondered if her luck was about to change . Well , she would think about it later . Right now she had to stop for pizza and go to the rehab center on New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Angie reached for her cell phone to call Tony 's Pizza on Oak Tree Road . She ordered three large pepperoni pies and was told they would be ready in ten minutes . That was good , the pies would still be hot when she delivered them to Eva and the other patients at the rehab center . On the ride to the pizza parlor Angie thought about her mother . A gutsy lady who had worked part time to help with the family bills . Back when she was young , with a family to help support , she 'd worked three days a week for Angus Eagle , a man her own age whose wife deplored housework . Her mother had cooked and cleaned for Angus , and in doing so they had forged a friendship that eventually resulted , one Christmas morning , in his turning over the gift wrap department at his store to her with a lifetime lease . Her mother never tired of telling her the story of that particular Christmas that changed her life , even though Angie , who was fifteen at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife had n't wanted to be bothered wrapping presents for Josh and her husband , so she 'd turned the job over to Eva . Each time her mother told the story , she would laugh and laugh and say how impressed Angus had been at her flair for gift wrapping . It was always at times like this , when Angie grew melancholy , that she thought about her own life and why she was doing what she was doing with it . She 'd gone to work on Wall Street as a financial planner , but five years of early mornings , late nights , and the long commute was all she could take . Then she taught school for a couple of years but could n't decide whether or not teaching was a career to which she wanted to commit herself . Five years ago , she 'd happily given it up without a second thought when , after her aunt Peggy got into a serious automobile accident in Florida , her mother suggested that Angie take over the gift-wrapping business . Eva had rushed down to care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in good hands , and was gone four years . After her aunt 's passing , Eva had remained to take care of her sister 's estate , returning to New Jersey only a year ago . It was nice having her mother home again , in the big old house on Rose Street . Angie giggled when she thought about all the young guys , the sons of friends her mother had invited to dinner on Sunday in the hopes one of them would be suitable for Angie . So far , she 'd made a lot of new male friends , but none of them was what she considered blow-my-socks-off material . As always , when she got to this point in her reverie , Angie 's thoughts turned to her beloved father and his passing . It had been so sudden , so shocking , so mind-bending , it had taken her years to come to terms with her loss . How she missed the big , jolly man who had carried her on his shoulders when she was little , the same man who taught her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a car . He 'd hooted and hollered at her high school graduation , beamed with pride at her college graduation , and could hardly wait to show her the brand-new car he 'd bought her . It was all wrapped up in a red satin ribbon . Oh , how she 'd cried when she 'd seen that little silver Volkswagen Jetta convertible . These days she drove a bright red Honda Civic , but the Jetta was still up on blocks in the garage on Rose Street . She planned to keep it forever and ever . Angie dabbed at her eyes . It was all so long ago . Twenty miles away , Eva Bradford sat in the sunroom of the Durham Rehab Center , waiting for her daughter . The television was on , but she was n't listening to the evening news . Nor was she paying attention to the other patients , who were talking in polite , low tones so others could hear the news . Her thoughts were somewhere else , and she was n't happy with where they were taking her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a fresh bag of frozen peas to place on her knee . She was young like Angie with a ready smile . " You know the drill , Eva , thirty minutes on and thirty minutes off . " The nurse , whose name was Betsy , reached for the thawed-out bag of peas Eva handed her . Eva wondered if she 'd ever dance again . Not that she danced a lot , but still , if the occasion warranted it , she wanted to be able to get up and trip the light fantastic . Knee replacements at her age were so common it was mind-boggling . She looked around the sunroom and counted nine patients with knee replacements , one a double knee , four hip jobs , and two back surgeries . Of all of them , she thought she was progressing the best . Another few days and she was certain she would be discharged with home health aides to help her out a few hours every day . She could hardly wait to return to the house on Rose Street in Metuchen . Eva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in a heated discussion over something that was going on in the Middle East . She did her best to slide down into the chair she was sitting on so she would n't have to look at Angus Eagle who , according to Betsy , had just been transferred from the hospital to receive therapy for a hip replacement he 'd had a month ago . She knew the jig would be up when Angie arrived with their nightly pizza . At this moment she simply did n't want to go down Memory Lane with Angus or be put in a position where she had to defend her daughter 's business dealings . She had n't seen Angus for a long time . At least five years-she really could n't remember . She tried to come up with the exact year . In the end she thought it was five years ago , the same year her older sister , Peggy , a childless widow , had been in that bad car accident . She 'd gone to Florida and stayed on for four years because her sister 's health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was up to her to see to her sister 's comfort . Then , she 'd stayed to handle all the legal matters , sell the house , the furnishings , and the car . She 'd been home for a year now . She swiped at the tears that threatened to overflow . Would Angie take care of her the way she 'd taken care of Peggy ? Of course she would . Angie had a heart of gold and loved her . She could n't help but wonder who was going to take care of Angus Eagle . Not that hard-as-nails son whose mission in life was to make Angie give up the gift wrap department . Well , Angus could certainly afford in-home health care around the clock . Eva looked up to see her daughter standing in the doorway holding three large pizza boxes , one for the two of them and two for the other patients . Angie was so kind . She watched as Angie handed two of the pizza boxes to Betsy and moved across the room to join her mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go today , Mom ? " " Not too bad . I think I 'll be out of here in a few days . Honey , Angus Eagle arrived today for additional therapy . He had a hip replacement a month ago , according to Betsy . He 's sitting over there between Cyrus and Harriet . Do n't look now . " " And this means ... what ? " Angie asked as she sprinkled hot peppers on the pizza , then handed her mother a huge slice . She chomped down on her own as she casually looked around . She had no trouble locating the elegant-looking Angus Eagle . At seventy years of age , he still looked dashing , with his snow-white hair , trim body , and tanned complexion . It had been a few years since she 'd seen him in the courtroom alongside his son . How angry he 'd looked that day . Today he looked like he was in pain . A lot of pain . " Well ... I do n't know . I 'm sure he hates us both . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know that old saying , blood is thicker than water . Josh is his son , so it 's natural for him to side ... whatever , " Eva dithered as she bit down into her slice of pizza . " Business is business , Mom . Is n't that what you always told me ? Sometimes people make deals that go sour . As long as it 's done legally , the way your deal was done legally , you live with it and go on . Josh and I had a rather heated exchange as I was leaving the store this evening . By the way , it 's cold out in case you 're interested . I think today was the first day that shop felt warm .
