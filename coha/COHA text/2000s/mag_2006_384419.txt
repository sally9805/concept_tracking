In the home of Dorian and Lavender Simpson , both of their children are victims of the painful blood disorder Photograph In a family portrait , Dorian and Lavender Simpson pose with their children , Tittany and Dorian Jr , both of whom have sick-le cell disease . // EVERYTHING about Tiffany Simpson appears to be perfectly fine . But pain and drugs have been her unwelcome , constant companion for much of her life . The 15-year-old , who lives in the San Fernando Valley section of Los Angeles with her parents and brother , has sickle cell disease . And so does her 5-year-old brother , Dorian Simpson Jr . The bright , attractive and , when she can be , very sociable youngster has been in and out of hospitals most of her life . She has n't been to school since early January and desperately misses her friends and the daily routine that many students take for granted . " People have heard of sickle cell disease , but they do n't pay attention to it because they 're not dealing with it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're dealing with it every day . " Dorian Jr . has , so far , fared better than his sister . However , several months ago , while Tiffany was in the midst of her crisis , he , too , was hospitalized for similar , excruciating pain . " Tiffany was in the hospital in Northridge Calif. and he was in Tarzana , " says Dorian Sr. , who , like his wife , is 36 and a native of Detroit . " My wife and I had to tag-team . We would both be at a different hospital . In the morning , I 'd be at the hospital visiting him , then switch with Lavender and go to see my daughter in the afternoon . " Photograph As a result of the almost constant pain of the disease , Tiffany ( above ) no longer attends regular school sessions ; assignments are sent to her home . She and her brother ( below ) take a break to enjoy some fruit . // Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder passed from parents to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape to sharp sickle or crescent shapes and can clog blood vessels . " When blood vessels become blocked , body tissue can become damaged as the result of not receiving an adequate supply of blood , " says Dr. Willarda Edwards , president of the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America . " This blockage , depending on where it occurs in the body , can cause tissue damage , pain episodes and stroke . Common symptoms of sickle cell disease SCD include fatigue , paleness , jaundice , shortness of breath and pain in the body organs and joints . " If both parents have the trait , there is a 25 percent chance of them having a child with the disease . Sickle cell affects between 80,000 and 100,000 vicitms , primarily Black individuals . Dr. Edwards points out , however , that it affects those of Mediterranean descent and Hispanics in smaller numbers . And , sadly , despite ongoing research , there still is no known cure . Parents can only try to make their children as comfortable as possible and , according to Lavender Simpson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eat a balanced diet . And pray . " " The pain is really hard to deal with . I experience pain pretty much through my entire bodymy arms , my back , my legs , " says Tiffany , in a voice of quiet resignation . " If s sharp pain everywhere . I have to stay hydrated at all times . That can help , but I 've been in continuous pain since November . " Because of her ongoing crisis , Tiffany completes her school assignments at home , and she hopes to join her classmates soon . In the meantime , she is at home , battling the excruciating , almost unbearable pain . When Tiffany is in crisis , doctors give her extremely potent drugs in an effort to alleviate the pain , but unfortunately many of them no longer give her relief . According to Dr. Edwards , proper hydration and blood transfusions can help , especially when patients are young . However , the downside of transfusions is the fact that iron accumulates in the body and can adversely affect various organs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an oral medication that is designed to help reduce the iron buildup in the body , she says . Sickle cell disease ( also known as sickle cell anemia ) , in the opinion of many AfricanAmericans , has not gotten the attention it deserves from the medical community , thereby directly impacting the possibility of finding a cure . The Simpsons say too few doctors deal with the disease or even have knowledge about it . " Many times , when a crisis comes up , we know more about the situation ) than the doctors do , " Lavender Simpson points out . Photograph During a crisis , Tiffany says her body fools like there are " sharp pains everywhere . " // In the 1970s , Dr. Edwards says the disease garnered significant attention , but it has almost fallen off the radar , with less public information being disseminated about it . She says an estimated 2.5 million to 3.5 million people are carriers or have the trait . But the fund-raising , advertising and educational efforts are lacking , she says . The Simpsons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about sickle cell disease as anyone whose lives have been affected by it . After Tiffany was born , the Simpsons tried to find as much information as they could about the disease . Armed with the growing knowledge they had gained over the years , they eventually had thoughts about having another child , despite the risks . But they took the chance . " It was devastating when we found out that DJ also had it , " says Dorian Sr. , who works with the California Highway Patrol . " We had weighed our options . We knew that both of us had the trait , but there was a 75 percent chance that our child would be born with just a trait or nothing at all . Normal . We wanted to have a larger family . The odds were in our favor . " Beyond taking care of their children , Lavender Simpson is diligent when it comes to spreading the word about sickle cell disease .

Despite their children 's condition , the Simpsons say they live their lives without focusing on the negative .
