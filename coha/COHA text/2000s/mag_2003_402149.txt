An array of potentially fatal diseases can hit expectant mothers hard , but all too often physicians shrug off their symptoms . Here 's why-and what moms-to-be can do to get the medical attention they need . // About 20 weeks into her first and only pregnancy , Patty Erikson , then 30 , developed a cough and shortness of breath . Worried , the Stewartsville , New Jersey , woman described her symptoms to her doctor during numerous visits . However , her physician was n't concerned , theorizing that Erikson was merely suffering the typical aches and pains of a pregnant woman . But at 33 weeks , Erikson 's breathing became so labored that her husband called an ambulance . Three days after admitting Erikson , physicians found the real cause behind her problem : a tumor wrapped around her trachea . Physicians performed an emergency C-section-delivering her small but healthy baby boy-and immediately started treating the cancer , which five years later is in remission . While she 's grateful that she and her child are OK , Erikson still wonders what happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure out what was wrong with me sooner , " she says . As anyone who 's been pregnant knows , a host of bodily woes are to be expected when you 're expecting . You may be exhausted , nauseous , vomiting , dizzy , headachy , swollen , short of breath-and then have six new problems a week later . If you were n't pregnant , your doctor would be running a flurry of tests to diagnose the problem . But if you 're a mom-to-be , few doctors respond with anything other than a variation of " Well , of course you 're not feeling very well . You 're pregnant ! " However , these seemingly typical pregnancy problems can also be a sign of something far more dangerous . That 's because the same symptoms that are part of a normal , healthy pregnancy can also indicate a serious disease . " There 's no doubt that pregnancy is generally the most dangerous point of a young woman 's life because of the increased demands on her body , " says Joshua Copel , M.D. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicine in New Haven , Connecticut . In fact , in the United States , between 1991 and 1999 , the maternal mortality rate rose from 10.3 to 13.2 out of every 100,000 live births due to complications caused by pregnancy , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Many of today 's moms-to-be are especially vulnerable to illness because they 're putting off having kids until later , notes Arianna Sholes-Douglas , M.D. , director of the High Risk Pregnancy Center at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore . " As women age , they have an increased risk of developing various health issues during pregnancy , " she says . Since a large number of these diseases have symptoms that are similar to a typical pregnancy , the warning signs are often not obvious until it 's too late . Instead , doctors chalk it up to a " pregnancy thing " and send women on their way . " Many obstetricians are guilty at some time of dismissing pregnant women 's symptoms , " says Sholes-Douglas . Many experts agree that this practice needs to change-or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Hazardous to your health ? Pregnant women are automatically screened for a number of disorders , including Strep B , syphilis , rubella , gestational diabetes , urinary tract and kidney infections , and high blood pressure ( a warning sign of preeclampsia , a syndrome that can lead to stroke and death of the mother and fetus ) . But even today , doctors still miss some of these relatively common pregnancy complications , with dire results . Eleni Tsigas , 40 , a spokeswoman for the Preeclampsia Foundation , knows all too well what can happen when an accurate , timely diagnosis falls through the cracks : Her baby girl died , most likely due to a late detection of preeclampsia , which affects 200,000 pregnant women a year and causes 16 percent of maternal deaths . While doctors had been checking Tsigas for signs of preeclampsia during her monthly visits , the mom-to-be 's symptoms cropped up between visits , prompting her to call her doctor 's office . " When I called at 28 weeks to tell them I had sudden swelling in my feet-a common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just told me to rest with my feet up and drink water , " recalls Tsigas . Less than a week later , Tsigas developed cramping and labor contractions . At the hospital , doctors diagnosed her with preeclampsia and delivered her baby , who was stillborn . " Nothing in my life could ever be as heartbreaking as burying my first child , " she says . " I could n't stop wondering what would have happened if my doctors had been more aggressive diagnosing me . My child might be alive today . " How can doctors be missing diseases they 're screening for ? Largely because they do n't always see the warning signs when patients do n't fit the typical disease profile , says Tsigas . Preeclampsia , for example , commonly gets overlooked in women whose blood pressure is usually low but whose numbers climb to the " normal " range when they get the disease . " The official definition that doctors use for preeclampsia is blood pressure of 140 over 90 , and a certain amount of protein in the urine , " explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the University of Washington and medical director of the Preeclampsia Foundation . " But if a woman starts her pregnancy with 100 over 60 and it climbs to 130 over 85 , that 's a significant increase and should immediately be taken very seriously by doctors . " Preeclampsia also gets missed in women who do n't have any of the typical risk factors ( such as being especially old or young , overweight , or in a first pregnancy or having a history of hypertension ) . This is a grave error , says Easterling . " Women can get preeclampsia without having a single risk factor for it , " he says . " A patient who does n't raise red flags in the doctor 's mind may not get seen until her symptoms have progressed . " Too little testing , too late Another reason routine screenings do n't always keep women safe is that some doctors are n't doing them as soon as they could be . The glucose test for gestational diabetes-which affects 5 percent of pregnant women-often is n't given until the third trimester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can catch some cases earlier . Why do some doctors hold off ? " Because it 's more cost-effective to wait , " says Norman Gant , M.D. , executive director of the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology . An early test is n't as accurate as one done later . " Wait until the third trimester , and you get more bang for your buck , " Gant explains , adding that concerned patients can request an earlier test , as long as they also get tested later . Without this glucose test , doctors rely on less obvious warning signs that can easily be mistaken for pregnancy pains . " The classic symptoms of diabetes are that you eat , drink , and urinate all the time , " says Gant . " What do pregnant women do ? Eat , drink , and urinate all the time . The other problem is that usually with diabetes , doctors watch for sugar in the urine , but pregnant women may already have increased sugar in their urine . " This resemblance can cause delays in diagnosis , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can cause kidney infections , a spontaneous abortion , pre-term labor , or birth defects . Diseases not on docs ' radar While diseases such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes are considered pregnancy-related complications , a host of other disorders , while not caused by pregnancy , can be exacerbated by the metabolic and hormonal changes that occur in moms-to-be . The main threats : thyroid disorders ( which affect 15 to 20 percent of pregnant women ) , breast cancer ( which occurs in about one in 3,000 pregnancies ) , and lupus ( about 20 percent of cases are diagnosed during pregnancy ) . And yet , in spite of how frequently these diseases appear , physicians are n't required to routinely screen pregnant women for them-which often allows the diseases to proliferate right under their noses . In some cases , such as with thyroid disorders , there 's no good reason tests are n't required , asserts Mary Shomon , author of Living Well with Hypothyroidism . " It 's outrageous , since the test is simple and inexpensive , " she says . Without the test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women with hypothyroidism ( underactive thyroid ) , for example , are often tired and constipated , and they gain some weight ; women with hyperthyroidism , or overactive thyroid , suffer from anxiety , heart palpitations , nausea , and vomiting . If undiagnosed , thyroid imbalances can put expectant moms at risk for diabetes , high blood pressure , depression , miscarriage , or developmental problems in their baby , says Copel . ( For more information on thyroid disorders , read " Are You Just Tired-or Sick ? " on page 44 . ) Tracy Green , 39 , of Plymouth , Michigan , had an undetected thyroid disorder throughout a fair amount of her pregnancy : Whenever she complained to her doctor about migraines , fainting spells , mood swings , and exhaustion so overwhelming she could n't get off the couch , " he 'd say , " Not all pregnancies are easy . You 're having a hard one , ' ' " Green recalls . After giving birth , Green still suffered from these symptoms as well as from constipation and hair loss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pregnancy just were n't back to normal yet , " she says . But to placate the new mom , he ran blood work , which showed that her cholesterol was off the charts at 435-so high the doctor requested that she repeat the test . That 's when Green stumbled across a lab technician who , while drawing her blood for the second test , suggested that Green ask her doctor to check for a thyroid disorder , which can cause high cholesterol . " So I did , " Green says . Only then was she diagnosed with hypothyroidism . Today , Green takes medication to correct her disorder ( while it often appears during pregnancy , it does n't usually disappear after birth ) and so far her 9-year-old child has shown no developmental delays . " I felt relieved when I was diagnosed . It was nice to know that I was n't going crazy , " Green says . " However , I wish my doctors had found the cause behind my problem earlier . Thyroid disease can make pregnancy really hard , and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so lucky . " When ob/gyns do n't do their job Still , other diseases go undetected , largely because some doctors are so overwhelmed by pregnancy symptoms that they do n't aggressively pursue an accurate diagnosis in every case . Breast cancer , for example , is tricky to detect because pregnant women 's breasts swell , making it much harder for physicians to find small lumps . For this reason , some ob/gyns do n't regularly do breast exams on women who are carrying a baby . That 's a big mistake , asserts Sholes-Douglas . " Many obstetricians are n't focusing on your breasts during this time , but they should be , " she says . " There 's no reason a doctor ca n't check your breasts during pregnancy . " But on average , the diagnosis of breast cancer during pregnancy is delayed five to 15 months , according to a study by the National Cancer Institute . Inexperienced M.D. 's Some disorders can fall off doctors ' radars because detecting them is so hard that only a high-risk pregnancy specialist can read the warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even today , no simple and accurate test for the disease exists . And because its symptoms ( fatigue , rashes , joint pain , hair loss , swelling ) can resemble those of a normal pregnancy , many primary care physicians and ob/gyns never see lupus coming in moms-to-be . When Jennifer Roberts , 29 , developed symptoms of lupus during her pregnancy ( exhaustion and pain in her face , joints , and chest that " hurt so much I thought I was having a heart attack " ) , neither her primary care doctor nor her ob/gyn suspected it was a serious problem , especially when her lupus test came back negative . Due to this inaccuracy , at 26 weeks , the Chicago-area resident was rushed to the hospital with vaginal bleeding . An exam revealed that she had preeclampsia and placenta abruption ( complications associated with lupus ) and needed an emergency C-section . But even then , her doctors did n't suspect the expectant mom had lupus , which was eventually diagnosed in Roberts by a specialist . Today , Roberts 's disorder is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born weighing one pound , four ounces ) , is a small but healthy and happy 4-year-old . " My husband and I nicknamed her Thor in the womb , because she was so strong to survive when I was so ill , " Roberts says , adding that she was relieved when she was finally diagnosed with lupus . " I do n't blame my doctor or ob/gyn for what happened ; they were doing the best they could , " she says . " But they just did n't have the experience to diagnose my disease . " How to protect yourself when pregnant While getting a correct diagnosis during pregnancy can be an uphill battle , women can greatly increase their odds by believing that they-and not their doctor-know their bodies best . " People trust doctors , but they miss stuff , " says Sholes-Douglas . " I 've missed stuff . " Pregnant women can help make their complaints stand out from those of myriads of other moms-to-be by , for starters , being specific . Remember , ob/gyns hear complaints all day long , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnant woman who says she has a headache . So if you 're experiencing the worst headache you 've ever had in your entire life , your doctor needs to know that . Another tip : " Doctors love numbers , so the more you can quantify your complaints , the more likely they are to understand the meaning of your symptoms , rather than just perceiving them as whining , " says Shoman . So instead of saying , " My hair is thinner , " say , " Two months ago my ponytail was twice as thick as it is now . " One key warning sign that your doctor 's not listening : You return more than once with symptoms that have gotten worse , and he does n't order additional tests . If you feel as if your doctor is dismissing your problems , get a second opinion-ideally with a perinatalogist , a medical doctor who specializes in maternal fetal illness and high-risk pregnancies . Since they see more women who have underlying illnesses , they 're more likely to get to the bottom of your problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific disease , request to be tested for it , says Shomon . " If your doctor refuses to do so , politely ask him to sign a note and put it in your chart that he 's refusing to give you that test despite your request for it , " recommends Shoman . " Do you know how fast he 'll order the tests ? " This provides proof that you 've asked him to look into your concern and makes him open to a medical malpractice lawsuit . Whenever you 're concerned you might have an emergency medical problem , such as preeclampsia , do n't ask if you should come in and see your doctor-insist on coming in . " No doctor died from seeing a patient too many times , " says Tsigas . Your reason for scheduling an appointment can be as simple as your peace of mind . Say , " I 'd feel more comfortable if I could come in so you could check my blood pressure and do a urine test . " By believing what your own body is telling you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can help protect your own health , your unborn child 's health , and who knows-maybe even the health of another pregnant woman . As Roberts says about finally being diagnosed with lupus , " My doctor told me he learned a lot from me . Maybe now when the next pregnant woman complains of symptoms that are similar to my own , he 'll call her in and test her or refer her to a specialist .
