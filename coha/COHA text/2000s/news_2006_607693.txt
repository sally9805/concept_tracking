<p> Karl Hobbs says he does n't care . <p> He says he does n't care about the critics who belittle George Washington 's soft nonconference schedule , a contributing factor to the Colonials receiving an unforgiving eighth seed in the NCAA tournament despite the best record in Division I. <p> He does n't care about massaging the media , once taking time away from discussing his team 's early-season victory over Maryland in the BB &T; Classic to take issue with a days-old newspaper headline . He does n't care about massaging his fan base , which he publicly reprimanded after boos were heard at Smith Center during an overtime win over Saint Louis in January . He does n't care about the persona he projects , stomping and screaming on the sidelines , taking technical fouls at inopportune moments and increasingly referring to himself in the third person , once talking about " the greatness of Coach Hobbs . " <p> The man responsible for the best men 's basketball season in George Washington history says he does n't care , either , about criticism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impossible to believe . After recent newspaper stories questioned the academic backgrounds of several George Washington players , the man who says he does n't care has launched counterattacks on battlefields ranging from hotel lobbies to television studios , from media teleconferences to arena hallways . He has constructed his argument using the rhetoric of race and politics and opportunities at a time when most coaches are talking about zones and brackets and fadeaways . <p> " What am I supposed to do , go run ? " he said when asked about his strong response . " I spoke up because my mentors , they spoke up . They did n't back down , they spoke up on what they believed . All you have to say is , ' Coach Hobbs believes in his heart that he 's doing the right thing . ' " <p> The Colonials already have won more games than any other George Washington team , achieved their best national ranking in a half-century and received the highest NCAA tournament seed in school history . But the 44-year-old coach , who often cites media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't recovered from stories in The Washington Post and the New York Times that scrutinized his players ' academic backgrounds . <p> Other school officials said they were embarrassed about the negative publicity but supportive of their admissions policies . They said they might have made a different decision about admitting one of the players had they known then what they know now , but that the school followed every NCAA rule and had done nothing wrong . <p> Hobbs has never equivocated . He has told reporters they are welcome to criticize him , his university , the NCAA , its academic certification process and the American educational system , but has pleaded with them not to attack his players . He has defended his right and his obligation to help young black men who came through failing inner-city school systems . He has accused media outlets of being opposed to racial diversity and has said he is fighting the same battles for educational opportunity once waged by former Georgetown coach John Thompson and recently retired Temple coach John Chaney . He has ignored advice from friends and assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to defend his players and his recruiting choices . <p> " I 'm not ' turning it into ' a social issue , " he said this week . " That 's what it is . I believe that . I know that . " <p> The Post reported earlier this month that forward Omar Williams , one of the most beloved and approachable members of the team , attended four high schools and prep schools over the course of seven years before arriving at George Washington . Williams 's former coach , Darryl Schofield , was the subject of a Feb. 12 Post article about possible academic misconduct at Lutheran Christian Academy in Philadelphia , a school GW guard Maureece Rice attended . Williams and Hobbs have declined to discuss Williams 's academic background , but Hobbs repeatedly has compared himself to Williams this month , while arguing that the player just needed a chance . <p> " I understand the system is flawed ; I understand all that , " Hobbs said during an impassioned 30-minute monologue on social and educational issues he delivered to reporters during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic 10 tournament . " I lived it . I grew up in Boston . I grew up in the inner city . And if you investigate my past , when I was 16 , 17 years old , I 'm guaranteeing you 'll find out I missed a lot of days of school . Oh yeah , by the way , I went to a couple of high schools , too . Imagine if Dom Perno Hobbs 's coach at the University of Connecticut had turned his back on me . " <p> Indeed , when Hobbs transferred to Cambridge Rindge &; Latin School in the fall of 1979 , joining a state championship team guided by future GW coach Mike Jarvis and starring future Georgetown and NBA legend Patrick Ewing , it ignited a controversy that eventually contributed to the reform of Massachusetts athletic transfer rules . The 5-foot-8 point guard initially was declared ineligible , with the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association ruling that Jarvis had recruited Hobbs against association rules . After two MIAA hearings , another with the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Council and extensive media coverage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members continued to maintain that Hobbs had been recruited . <p> " I 'm pleased that I 'll be allowed to play , but disappointed that they could not see that I made the decision myself , " Hobbs told the Boston Globe at the time . " I made this move because I wanted to better myself . " <p> Jarvis said Hobbs , who was raised in a tough neighborhood in Roxbury , Mass. , was a model student at Cambridge . He dressed immaculately . He carried books everywhere . He never showed outward signs of anger about the eligibility controversy , but he also never apologized for trying to improve his lot . <p> " He spoke about how important it was for him to succeed , not just for himself but for his family , " Jarvis said . " He wanted to basically do the very best he could do so he could be in a position to go to college , to go to a good school . And that was very much in question , because people tried to make it difficult for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many times , when people try to prevent you from doing something , it makes you that much stronger , that much more determined . . . . He was on a mission . " <p> Friends , associates and rival coaches have said in recent days that they do n't question Hobbs 's conviction when he argues in favor of increased opportunities . Norman Bailey , one of Hobbs 's teammates at U-Conn. , said Hobbs never declined an invitation to speak to children at the alternative detention center at which Bailey worked , telling the children they need not be defined by their mistakes and that they could turn their lives around . Kevin Freeman , who helped U-Conn. win a national championship when Hobbs was an assistant coach there , credits Hobbs with persuading him to finish his education . After five years of playing professionally , Freeman now is completing a political science degree . <p> " I was leaning toward going to get another paycheck ; that 's the way I 've been living my life the last few years , " said Freeman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He called me back immediately and told me the best decision I could make is to go back and finish my education , that that will provide the most opportunities for me , not just in basketball but in life . Him telling me that , I just put everything else away , and I knew that was the right decision to make . " <p> Hobbs said that he accepts players from difficult backgrounds based on their character and determination rather than because of pieces of paper bearing quantitative measurements . That recruiting philosophy conforms with Hobbs 's social views , but there 's no question it also was a fast route to competitive rewards for a program that often ca n't compete for the nation 's most highly regarded recruits . <p> The year before he arrived in Foggy Bottom , the Colonials went 14-18 and finished seventh in the Atlantic 10 . Over the past two seasons , they have won two regular season league titles and 27 of 32 league games . And of the top five American-born players on Hobbs 's current team , four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to qualify academically for NCAA competition . He has said that his character evaluations have been accurate , and that the first four players he recruited to GW are on pace to graduate in four years , including Williams , who voluntarily attended summer school each of the past three years . <p> " What makes me a good coach ? " he asked . " My ability to recognize potential , my ability to recognize potential in people . That 's what I do for a living . " <p> Invariably , those players praise Hobbs for giving them an opportunity . <p> " Coach Hobbs should be getting some kind of reward , some kind of medal for what he 's doing , " said leading scorer Danilo Pinnock , who did not play basketball his senior year of high school because of academic issues and met NCAA eligibility requirements by attending Coastal Christian Academy in Virginia Beach . " I 'm going to have a chance to walk away from George Washington with a degree , from George Washington University . What else can I say ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm from can say that . Not too many people from Omar Williams 's neighborhood and Maureece Rice 's neighborhood can say they have a college degree . These guys will have a chance to say that . " <p> This , too , has been an explicit part of Hobbs 's defense this month . Using points that range from demographic data to the government 's response to Hurricane Katrina , from the musical efforts of Berry Gordy to the writings of neurosurgeon and author Benjamin Carson , Hobbs  --  as Thompson and Chaney did before him  --  has made matters of race and class central to the debate over athletic scholarships . <p> " I 'm an African American , " he said , when asked how these social issues became part of his life . " Look up the history of people that are black . " <p> He has told white reporters that they ca n't understand the issues facing some of his black players . He has said that suburban players who transfer from one high school to another are n't subjected to the same scrutiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his players have been the innocent victims of institutional neglect . <p> " There 's a lot of school systems around the country that are failing poor , minority students , " he said . " If you 're going to pick at the scab , pick it all the way , do n't just pull at the edges and allow it to fester . Go deep , and find out how can we fix this system . . . . How can we fix this ? That 's my question . The NCAA is making millions and billions or whatever the thing is with the contract through CBS and the NCAA tournament . Are they pouring any of that money back into these school systems so we can eliminate these prep schools we 're talking about , so that innocent kids do n't get hurt ? . . . <p> " Why did I recruit Williams ? I recruited him because I saw the potential in him , just as well as I saw the potential in all of the other guys . That 's what I saw in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all of his paperwork : ' Wow , I wonder what would happen with this kid if you made him go to class every day , you put some structure in his life , you make it so he does n't have to work while he 's going to school , where he can just focus on school ? I wonder what would happen with this kid ? I wonder if I could change his life ? ' " <p> If the argument sounds familiar , it 's not by accident . Hobbs , who is considered a rising star in coaching and has been mentioned in connection with several high-profile jobs this season , has said he would not be a head coach today without the outspoken examples set by Thompson and Chaney , who retired from Temple on Monday . He called them " models of the community , the voice for a lot of inner-city kids and the voice for a lot of us young coaches . " <p> Hobbs also has cultivated the us-against-the-world mentality Thompson was famous for , pitting himself and his team against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colonials ' first loss this year , he described his team  --  which starts three seniors and two juniors  --  as " a program that 's overachieving with some young guys that play hard , and occasionally we win some games . " <p> As the wins continued to pile up this season , reporters have occasionally challenged the " overachieving " mantra , but Hobbs has never retreated . <p> " He 's what we 're about , our whole philosophy : the little guy with the big chip on his shoulder , " said forward Mike Hall , one of Hobbs 's first recruits at GW . " That 's us . We 're the kids who people thought were n't talented enough , were n't academically or athletically supposed to be here . We 're in the middle of a basketball-mad town with two other big universities getting most of the coverage . And somehow we got ta fight our way through all that , the perceptions , everything . Coach feeds off that just like we do . " <p> This evening , George Washington will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Colonials have not won an NCAA tournament game since 1994 . During several of his expositions on class and social issues in recent days , Hobbs has said that he should be preparing for the Seahawks instead of talking with reporters . But each time , he has resumed his discourse . <p> " I want to be a basketball coach , that 's what I want to do , I want to be a basketball coach , " he said last week . " I do n't want to be a politician . I do n't want to try to solve all the problems in the inner city , I do n't want to do that . But I have no choice . I 've been thrust into this thing . " <p> Staff writer Mike Wise contributed to this report .
