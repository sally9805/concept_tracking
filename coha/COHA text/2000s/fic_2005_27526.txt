You Have Six Messages Yikes ! " Rachel Russell hollered . She turned and called to Andy , " You 're in trouble now . Real trouble . Just wait till Mom sees this mess . " Andy Russell , his sister , Rachel , and their friend Tamika Anderson had just come home from school . Rachel was standing by the open front door to the house . " Let me see , " Andy said . He hurried up the front walk to the house and looked in . The closet door was open . Coats , hats , scarves , gloves , umbrellas , and the morning newspaper were on the floor . " I 'm not in trouble . I did n't make this mess and you know it , " Andy said . " I was in school all day . We got on and off the bus together . " " Then who did ? " Rachel asked . How would I know ? Andy thought , but that 's not what he said . Instead he joked , " Who did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found out I was the one who spilled the doughnut holes all over her desk and she 's getting even . " " Spilled doughnut holes on her desk , " Tamika said . " That 's funny . " Andy bowed . " Well , this mess is n't funny , " Rachel said . " Maybe a raccoon came down the chimney . I 've heard they do that . " Rachel and Tamika cautiously walked in . They quietly put their book bags down , stood by the front door , and looked around . Andy was n't cautious at all . He walked right past them to the kitchen . " Hey , " he called . " Look in here . " The breakfast dishes were still on the table . The milk and juice containers were out . Mr. and Mrs. Russell 's cups still had coffee in them . " Mom and Dad rushed off , " Rachel said . " Maybe Mom is having the baby and that 's why the house is a mess . " " The baby ! " Andy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evan , was born ! " He threw the newspaper into the air . " Two Russell boys and one Russell girl . " He pointed to Rachel and laughed . " You 're the odd one . It 's a boys ' house now . " " Maybe , " Rachel said , " and maybe not . Maybe the baby is a girl . " " No it 's not . I mean no he 's not . The doctor said it 's a boy . Mom took that test . " " The test might be wrong , " Rachel explained . " We 'll have to wait until the baby is born to be sure . She might be a girl . Then you 'll be the odd one . You 're the odd one , anyway . " " I am not odd . I 'm just exuberant . Dad said so . " Tamika interrupted them . " Let 's look for a note . Your parents must have left a note . " " There 's nothing on the counter , " Andy said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added . " They were probably in too much of a rush to write a note , " Rachel said . " But maybe they called from the hospital and left a message . " She pushed the PLAY button on the answering machine . Hello , the machine said . You have six messages . Then the tape began to rewind . " This is your first message , " Andy announced . Then he said " Hello " in a pretend baby 's voice . " This is your new brother talking . GET ME OUT OF HERE . GET ME OUT OF THIS HOSPITAL ! " " You think a baby can talk , " Rachel said . " You probably think the baby will go to school with us and help you with your homework . " " Sure he will . We Russell guys are pretty smart . " Message one . " Hello ? Hello ? Are you there , Anne ? This is Jacob Kamen . Are you in the hospital ? If I do n't hear from you soon I 'll get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high school math teacher . Message two . " Charles ? Charles ? This is Bob . Where are you ? Please , call and tell me what 's going on . " " He 's Dad 's boss , " Rachel told Tamika . Mr. Russell was a carpenter . Message three . " Carol ? Carol ? This is Jake . I know you 're there . Please , pick up the telephone . " " There 's no Carol here , " Andy told the answering machine . " You have the wrong number . " Jake said , " Come on , Carol . " " Did n't you hear me ? " Andy asked . " There 's no Carol here . " " Poor Jake , " Tamika sighed . " And poor Carol , " Rachel added . " I bet she 's waiting for his call . " " I 'm sorry you feel like that , " Jake said . " Please , call me if you want to talk . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
