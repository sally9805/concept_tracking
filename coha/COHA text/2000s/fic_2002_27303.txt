U-Haul The night my father moved away he fought his oldest son . The fight was close . My father was fat , while my brother was athletic and lean . My brother dodged his blows and at first it appeared he would even win . But my father got his shoulders low , got his weight into him , and rammed him to the wall . A cuckoo clock my parents had bought in Switzerland jarred loose and fell on my brother 's head . The clock was sharp and heavy and it cut his scalp so streams of blood ran down his cheeks . After the blood , they hugged and my brother helped him carry his things to the U-Haul truck outside . Roaches That fall the roaches took over our home . I call it a home because that ' s what we were trying to make , but we never made it . It was a fourth-floor , two-room apartment with no sunlight that , like most things in New York , we paid too much for . I do n't know why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage  --  that New York would do us good . We were both new to the city . Neither of us knew anything about New York or about roaches . " They 're back , " I said one day when she came in from work . " Who 's back ? " Melody , my wife , said . It must have been hard for her to come home during that time . I was working part-time and taking a graduate course in philosophy . She was working full-time , counseling rape victims . She looked exhausted , which was how she looked nearly every day I saw her come home from that job . She was underquali . ed for it , really , with only a master ' s degree . The YWCA had hired her to do " short-term therapy " with recent victims  --  or survivors , as she told me to call them  --  ofrape or sexual abuse . She was cheaper for them to hire than a psychologist and she did all of the dirty work . She got all of the pain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t work with anyone long enough to see them make much of any progress . She set down the leather bag that held her work things  --  the files and papers about her clients  --  and looked slowly up at me . Her eyelids and the skin below her lovely green eyes looked dark and saggy , almost like she had been crying . She still looked beautiful , though . She always looked beautiful . She had been told more than once growing up that she had what it took to make it in modeling . Instead she had chosen to take on the burden of other people ' s pain , as a therapist . " Who ? Who 's back ? " she said . " The roaches . " " Why ? " " I don ' t know . You tell me , " I said . She went to the kitchen sink  --  which was practically in our living room  --  and picked up a damp rag that I had folded and hung neatly over the neck of the spigot . She rinsed it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 've got ta keep it clean , " she said . I just looked at her . " We 've got to keep it clean or they 'll come . " " It is clean . " " No , it is n't . " She shook her head and started making some strokes over the stove top . She stopped at a little black piece of something that had stuck itself to the white metal next to one of the burners and got down at eye level to look at it . She scrubbed at it vigorously . " I already did that , " I said . " This is hors d'oeuvres . Hors d ' oeuvres for roaches . " She had this way of selecting a dramatic word and exaggerating it with her tone . I always tried not to take it personally . " I already tried to get that up , " I said again , but she kept scrubbing at the piece of burnt food . She stood up and pointed at the black spot and looked at me . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishrag under the faucet again and squeezed it out on the range to moisten the spot she was working on . " You see , if you do n't eat , you die , " she said . " Roaches are like people in that sense . " " Who 's feeding them ? " " You are if you leave it dirty like this . " " I did n't think I did . " She found another bit of something dark and crusty burnt into the stove top and pointed to it . I recognized it as the spaghetti sauce I had made the day before , which had boiled and splashed over . " That ' s the difference between you and roaches , " she said . " To you this is clean , but to roaches this is a smorgasbord . " That evening , after we ate and washed the dishes , we mopped and scrubbed the whole kitchen area together . We used bleach and Lysol on the countertops and floor , and we took out all the food from the cupboards and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and granola into clear plastic Rubbermaid containers . Even the linguine , which we had used half a box of , we broke to make fit in a Ziploc freezer bag . " Did you have roaches at home growing up ? " I asked as we were sealing the last few things . She popped one of the pretzels she was transferring to Tupperware in her mouth and it made a crunching sound . " Why do you ask ? " Melody said , chewing nonchalantly . " You just seem to know a lot about them , " I said . She clicked the top on the Tupperware container and put it in the cupboard next to the Ziploc pasta bag . " It 's just common sense , really . You take away the source of nourishment ... and you eliminate the odor . " She thought for a moment . " You eliminate the stench , " she said . That night lying next to her in bed , I wondered if , after we turned out the living room and kitchen lights , the roaches had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we liked to sleep with the window open for fresh air . I felt the cold coming in over our heads , and it made me wonder what the cold would do to them . I could tell from Melody ' s breathing that she was still awake . " How do you think the cold affects them ? " I said . " Who 's that , Wilson ? " She sounded weary and exhausted again . " The roaches , " I said . " I 'm done for tonight . I 'm done talking about roaches . " She rolled over on her side and faced the opposite wall . " Can we please go to sleep now , " she said . I was lying on my back , and I turned my head to look at her . All of the lights in our apartment were off , but the street lamps from outside were leaking into the bedroom . The skin on her neck and shoulder looked soft and wonderful and I found myself wishing that this beautiful woman  --  my wife  --  would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I ' ve got more important things on my mind than roaches , " she said . " Like what ? " I said too quickly . " What do you think ? " The week before I had pushed her to talk when she did n't want to , and she ended up asking me whether I knew what it was like to listen all day to people who have been " fucked in the ass by their fathers . " " I ' m sorry , good night , dear , " I said . " Good night , " she said , leaning back and kissing me on the cheek as a kind of reward for leaving her be . I lay next to her for ten minutes or so trying to sleep , but I could n't forget the fact that I wanted to make love to her and I could n't clear my mind of the roaches . When I heard her breathing change and I was sure she 'd gone to sleep , I got up off the mattress  --  we kept it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the kitchen . I flipped the light on and looked quickly to see if any had come out . There were a few on the counter near the stove and I grabbed a magazine in the living room to kill them . I got one , a tiny one , so small I could n't even hear it crunch , but the bigger , faster ones scrambled into the crack at the intersection of the wall and countertop before I could get to them . I did n't know then what I know now about roaches . I did n't know that it 's futile trying to kill them that way . I did n't know that it 's futile to try to kill them one by one . I sat down on one of the ice-cream-parlor-style chairs we had bought at a garage sale a few weeks before . They were horribly uncomfortable , but they were cheap and we needed chairs , so we had bought them . There was so little space in the apartment that we kept them along the wall in the kitchen and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up our folding table for meals . I thought about that , about how small and uncomfortable and underfurnished our apartment was . We had no furniture , but we had roaches . I got up and went over to the window near the stove . It was locked , so I flipped the latch and opened it as far as it would open and I felt the cold air rush in . I went back into the bedroom and lay back down on the mattress next to my wife , and I felt the cool air coming in the window above our mattress again . " Roaches ca n't like the cold , " I thought . I considered the cool air in the kitchen and wondered if it would have an effect . " They 're like people in that sense , too , " I thought , pulling the covers up to my chin and rolling away from her to the far edge of the bed . The cold air or the cleaning or something must have helped a little bit , because a few days went by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were n't gone , I knew the problem would have to be addressed in more detail at some future time . Sure enough , when I went to empty the trash at the end of the week , a bunch of good-sized adults scrambled out of the container and back into the recesses of the cabinetry . That night I brought it up with Mel . She sighed and said , " I ' ll tell you what , I ' m letting you in charge of the roaches . " She had that tired , **25;0;TOOLONG look again , but I pressed her on it anyway . " I just think it 's something we should discuss , " I said . " I do n't have time to discuss it . " " We ca n't just ignore the problem , " I said . " Look , I want to say this as nicely as I can . " She took a deep breath . " I 'm working every day and my job is very stressful for me . " She took one of my hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy as I am . Could you just do this for me ? Could you take care of the roaches ? " I felt bad that I could n't identify more with what she went through at work , and I wanted to show her I understood the pain it brought her . She could have been trying to make lots of money , but instead she was sacrificing herself to listen to rape victims all day . I loved her for that . " Sure , I 'll handle them , " I said . She hugged me and said , " Thank you , Wilson . Thank you . " I do n't know how long it takes for roach eggs to hatch , but that must have been what happened . I thought about having someone in , some kind of an exterminator , but I didn ' t like the idea of chemicals in our home . It seemed like we should be able to handle the problem ourselves . I guess I was thinking that Mel was generally right about keeping things sealed and clean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept food away from them . It was the one night a week that we treated ourselves to an evening out . It was Sunday evening so the city was mellower , more to our taste . We rode the number 9 train down to a cute little bistro place in that quaint part of the West Village with all the quiet , narrow streets . We liked that area because it seemed so much cleaner and more romantic than the neighborhood where we lived , which had high buildings , dirty sidewalks , wide streets and heavy traffic . We had a fine evening and we got a little tipsy on a bottle of cheap red wine . After the meal we got dessert crpes from a little stand we knew about and carried them with us on the subway . We were going to feed them to each other in bed . Maybe they had been coming out after midnight while we were sleeping and we just didn ' t know it , but I think the eggs must have been gestating and somehow they all hatched at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with our crpes , it looked like the kitchen floor was alive . They were all over the place . We 'd had some cheese and crackers and a glass of our own cheap red wine before we ' d gone out , and we had n't put any of it away . They were devouring the cheese and crackers and there was even one crawling up the stem of a wineglass . Mostly they were in the kitchen , but a few of the bigger , more obnoxious ones had wandered into the living room . One of them , quite a large one , had flipped over on its back and was trying to get itself turned over again . It was writhing and kicking all of its little legs in the air , desperately . " Oh Jesus , Will , kill it , " Mel said , incensed . Mel had hustled past the kitchen and taken a seat in one of our ice-cream-parlor chairs along the wall of our tiny living room . I had stomped on a few in the kitchen maniacally , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my wife staring at me . She plopped our crpes on our desk , and some of the slices of banana with Nutella fell out on it . She propped her elbows on her knees and put her face in her hands . " Do something , would you ? " she said , almost shouting . I stomped out a moderate-sized roach that was making a run for the kitchen and then I honed in on the one on its back . Now I ' ve killed plenty of things before  --  flies and wasps and mice and fish , even small game like rabbits and birds  --  but for some reason I was having trouble with this roach . It was just lying there upside-down , kicking its legs and wriggling . It looked so helpless and pathetic to me . It must have known with the lights suddenly on that it was in trouble , it must have sensed the presence of hostile humans in the room because as I walked over to it , it started moving its legs even more rapidly . It rocked itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought it might right itself and flip over and try to run away . I knew by this time that the big ones are very fast , and I was ready for it . If it did turn over onto its legs again , it was n't going to escape . I felt kind of silly when I realized how I was approaching it . I had my knees bent and my arms out to the side like a defensive back . " Wilson , just kill it , please , " she said . I wish now that I would have just so she could have seen me crunch it , so she could have seen me exterminate one mercilessly . It would have driven home to her the fact that I was doing everything I knew how to do , that I was facing the roach problem . But I did n't . I didn ' t kill it . Instead I picked up a newspaper off the desk and scooped it up using the newspaper like a dust pan . I did it very carefully so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper and up my arm . I felt Mel watching me as I balanced it on the Arts and Leisure section of the New York Times and opened the window next to our desk with my free hand . I thought one last time about crushing it , but instead I flipped it out the window , into the cold , onto the sidewalk four stories below . It sounded like she was going to cry . " Why did n't you kill it ? " she said . " I don t think it will hurt us down there . " " It 's just the principle of it . " She looked away and shook her head . " He 'll die from exposure , " I said . " Roaches don ' t die from exposure . " She put her face in her hands and then looked up and squinted at me . " You should have crushed it , " she said . I stared at her for a couple of seconds , perplexed and amazed at the fact that we were arguing about roaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should have , " I said . She glared at me for a few moments and then she got up and went into the bathroom . I heard her pee and I heard the toilet flush and then she came out and went into the bedroom . I heard her sit down on the bed and I heard the sound of her shoes plopping on the floor . Then , it got quiet again . I went into the kitchen and killed a few of the little , newly hatched ones that had n't been smart enough to clear out once the light had come on . I smushed them with a paper towel one by one . I was beginning to realize how futile it was to kill them like that , individually , but it did n't stop me . I was taking some kind of personal revenge . " Goddamn you , " I said out loud . I noticed that one I had already smeared into the counter was still moving a few of its legs . " Die , you bastard , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smushed carcasses off the counter and floor with damp paper towels , I went into the bedroom to see what Mel was up to . I thought maybe she 'd be reading or waiting up for me , but she was curled up facing the far wall with the covers pulled all the way to her chin . I went back into the middle room to get the crpes . The banana slices that had fallen out on the desk had deposited some of their chocolate there , but I just pushed the slices back into the crpes and left the chocolate where it was . I went into the bedroom and set the crpes on the windowsill while I undressed , and then I picked them up again and sat up next to her in bed holding them in one hand . I had stripped down to my underwear and as I got into bed I brushed against the back of her leg and felt the roughness of her jeans . She had n't even undressed . " Do you want to eat the crpes ? " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ve got them both here , " I said . There was a period of silence and then she said , " Did you wash your hands since you killed those roaches ? " I looked at my left hand , which was holding both crpes . There was wax paper around the bottom of them and my hands were n't touching the crpes directly at that moment , but in fact my hands had n't been cleaned . I sat quietly for a while trying to figure out what to say . " No , but I didn ' t really touch them directly , " I said . " The roaches or the crpes ? " I thought about the question . " Either , " I said . I listened to her breathing and watched her shoulders rise and fall while she considered my answer . " I do n't want the crpes anymore , " she said . There was always something to feel dirty about during that time and it had begun to take its toll on our physical intimacy . There was the sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the filthy overcrowdedness of the city , the tiny apartment . There was the idea of making love to someone who you were n't sure still desired you . But the night we had a roach sighting in our bedroom seemed , the way I remember it , to have the greatest effect on our sex life . It was my fault , I blame myself for it . I was supposed to be in charge of the roaches . I had promised her that . It was a Monday night . She had come home early from work because her last client had canceled and she was in an unusually good mood . She had stopped and bought fresh flowers , blue orchids , and she had set them up on our portable dinner table in the middle room where we ate if we actually took the time to sit down . She had tossed a salad and made the dressing herself out of balsamic vinegar and olive oil and thyme and a bunch of other fresh spices she had bought that afternoon on her way home from work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusually pleasant meal . Afterwards she had taken a shower and invited me to bed with her . It was only nine o ' clock . She went into the bedroom with only a towel around her and lit a candle and turned out the lights . She took off her towel and got under the covers with no clothes on . " Come onto my side , " she said as I undressed . Now the strange thing about our sleeping setup in that apartment was not just that we had no box spring or bed frame , so that the mattress was directly on the floor , but it was also that it was n't a real double bed that we slept on . It was actually two single beds pushed together to make one large one . We used a separate fitted sheet on each of the mattresses , so there was an obvious crack between us , right in the middle of the bed . " Sure , I ' ll come to your side , " I said . This was only one day after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what happened . I should have kept everything immaculate . I had slept in the morning after the crpes and had n't worried about cleaning up the kitchen until the afternoon , when I ' d arrived back from class . I had almost forgotten about them . They were there on the windowsill in the bedroom where I had left them the previous night until just before Mel got home from her counseling . I was still scrambling to get everything clean when I heard her unlock the door to the apartment . It was only then that I remembered the crpes . I ran into the bedroom to take care of them . Some sticky stuff had leaked onto the windowsill , but I was in a hurry and I didn ' t wipe it up . I accidentally dropped them on the floor and they left a moist sticky area on the hard wood floor , but I just smeared it quickly with my shoe . I put the crpes in the trash can next to our chest of drawers and stuffed them to the bottom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and then I stuffed them back on top of the crpes so the crpes would n't be visible . I had planned to come back and tend to all of it  --  the sticky juice on the windowsill and floor and the crpes in the trash can  --  but I forgot and that stuff stewed on the windowsill , on the floor , and in our trash can for two days . Mel , of course , didn ' t know any of this when she took off her towel and invited me onto her side of the bed . " Are you going to come or not ? " she said playfully . She took my boxer shorts off and climbed on top of me right away . She put me inside of her so quickly that I decided she must have gotten herself ready in the shower or else gotten ready just thinking about it . " Oh my God , Wilson , " she said . " Oh my God , " I said back . " Oh my God , " she said again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moved over to the other side of the crack between the beds and crossed her legs . She started rubbing her forehead and shook her head . " I do n't believe it . " " What ? What did I do ? " I said . I was still facing the window like I had been when she was on top of me . She was facing the other way  --  toward the chest of drawers and the trash can . She put one hand on her forehead and pointed with the other behind me , where the trash can was . I pulled the sheets up over my waist and sat up and turned around and saw it there . It was on the rim of the trash can , just perched there , unaffected , staring down in . It knew the crpes were at the bottom , obviously . It was either breaking from a feast or it smelled them and was pausing for a few seconds on its way in . The candle was on top of the chest of drawers above the trash can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the flame was making the roach ' s shell shine , almost scintillate . The light must have made it look much bigger than it actually was . It looked huge . " I 'm sorry , " I said instinctively . That was the first time I thought of using the full name . " That , " I remember thinking , " is a cock roach . " I guess it had smelled the crpes and snuck all the way in from the kitchen because I ca n't imagine that they were living in our bedroom . It was dark in the apartment except for the candlelight , so that must have been how it had the courage to come all the way in and why it was n't spooked by our presence there . I dug around for my underwear under the sheets . When I finally found them , I put them on and went over to the trash can . The cockroach scrambled down in when I came near , and frankly , I was glad . I didn ' t feel like chasing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have to do that , not right after having , or sort of having , sex with her . It was n't really the roach 's fault anyway . He was just acting on instinct . I was the one who 'd left the food around . It was only his need to eat , his survival instinct , that had led him into our bedroom . I carried the trash can out into the kitchen and dumped it out into the bigger garbage can under the sink . I thought about taking all of the trash outside right then  --  I suppose I should have  --  but that would have meant hiking down three flights of stairs and going out into the cold with it or just leaving it out in the hall , which would have been pretty rude to the other tenants . I left it under the sink and went back into the bedroom . " I ' m sorry , " I said when I got back into bed . She was rolled over on her side facing the far wall with the covers pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant roaches came up out of the crack between our mattresses . *** By the end of November , Mel was ready to give up on things . She gave her notice at work because , she said , it was just taking too much out of her . We both knew it was going to be over for good when the lease ran out at the end of the year . We had been trying to make it work for too long , and we had both come to some kind of an end . When her job ended the first week of December , she packed her clothes and rode the train to Reading , Pennsylvania , where she was going to live with a friend until I came home closer to Christmas . We had decided , though , by that point , that we were n't going to spend the holiday together . It had to start being officially " over " sometime and there was no sense dragging it on . Somehow , I was left the job of moving everything out . In that last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things up and everything was all over the place . I had packed up our cutlery and dishes and I had been getting takeout every night . I did n't really care about the roaches anymore , either , once she was gone . I did n't know what I was going to do . I did n't know if I 'd try to find a cheaper apartment and return to graduate school in January or if I 'd take off for somewhere much cheaper and slower than New York , perhaps get a job painting houses or waiting tables . There were pizza boxes , Chinese food containers and beer bottles littered all over the kitchen and living room floor . One night just before I headed home for the holiday , I ended up at a party hosted by someone from the restaurant where I had been working . I did n't know many people there comfortably , but there was one woman there whom I had chatted with once or twice at work and who had seemed unusually warm and compassionate to me . She saw me from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink , smiling . We started getting along quite well . We laughed and drank and talked by ourselves most of the night . Now I 'm not the type to cheat , but it was basically over between me and Melody and she was gone and I was drunk enough that I figured there was no harm in having a friend back to the apartment for one more drink at the end of the evening . I do n't even remember exactly how it went  --  whether I invited her up or whether she invited herself along  --  but I was quite depressed at the time and she seemed like a very compassionate person to me . She had big puffy cheeks with dimples when she smiled . She was cute and kind , I thought , and I was glad she was paying attention to me . " Do you want to smoke a bowl ? " she said when we got in the door to what occurred to me , suddenly , was not just my , but Mel 's and my apartment . " That would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done that in a long time . " She took off her jacket by the door while I turned the lights on . When I peeked around the corner into the kitchen and saw what I saw there , I thought of Mel 's lectures right away . " You 've got to keep it immaculate , " I heard her say in my head . Of course I started blaming myself immediately . I thought , Now that Mel is gone and only you are here to take care of the apartment , they have taken over completely . Now your life is really going to pieces . I 've tried to be objective about this looking back on it because I know I was quite drunk , but there were hundreds of them that night . Hundreds . I ' m certain of it . They were all over the kitchen floor . They were crawling in and out of the pizza boxes , feasting , as Mel liked to say , on all the food I had left lying around . One monster had its face buried in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the street . It had its legs braced behind it trying to get deeper in . " You can hang your jacket here , " I said , stalling my new friend and showing her the closet next to the door where we had come in . A bunch of Mel 's jackets were in there , including the old leather one I had bought at an antique clothing store for her birthday . I felt hurt , momentarily , that Mel had n't taken it along , but I did n't have time to dwell on that for very long . I saw my friend glance at Mel 's jackets , but she did n't say anything . Fortunately my stalling worked . I had turned the light on in the kitchen and living room , and while we hung up her coat most of them went into hiding . I shielded her as we walked past the kitchen and she did n't notice anything . I stole a glance in and only a few of the most audacious roaches were still out in the light snacking . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oor while she got out her little bag and packed a bowl for us . " So how long has it been ? " " It 's been awhile , " I said . I had had some paranoid episodes the last few times I 'd smoked and I was telling her the truth when I said it had been a long time . I had basically decided that I would n't do it anymore , but this was different somehow . She gave me the pipe and asked if I had a lighter . " I think so , " I said . I went into the bedroom and got the lighter that Mel used to light our candle and brought it in . I lit the bowl and drew on it and handed it back to her . She took a hit and smiled and we passed it back and forth like that a bunch of times . The pot seemed to be doing peaceful things to me , the things I figured it did to people who smoked it all the time . " Kind , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nice , huh ? " she said at the tail end of her exhale . We passed it back and forth , smiling mildly at each other for a little while longer . I remember that it was very comfortable between us at that time , which might be why she did n't feel strange asking what she asked next . " Do n't you have a girlfriend ? " she said . It felt sudden and a little threatening to me . " Yeah , sort of , " I said . " She was living here , was n't she ? " She looked around at the boxes of books and plates and pictures stacked along the wall . " Yeah , she was , " I said . " Where is she now ? " " She sort of moved out . " " Sort of ? " she said playfully . " Yeah , I think she moved out , " I said . She studied me for a little while and then she raised the pipe to her mouth to try to light it again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was one of those childproof lighters and she was having trouble with it . I reached over and took it from her and as I did I felt the feeling of my fingers on the soft skin of her hand . I clicked the childproof clicker down and handed it back to her . " Now try . " " Thank you . " She smiled and nodded at me . " Thank you very much , " she said . She locked her eyes on mine while she lit the bowl and then she looked away and exhaled the bluish smoke and said , " What went wrong with you and her ... if I may ask ? " As she spoke , her head bobbed around and her wavy hair bounced in front of her face on one side . I took another hit and held it in and looked around the room at all of the stuff half-packed in boxes on the floor . One of the boxes had a picture of Mel and me sticking out the top of it and I recognized it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wall of our bedroom . " I mean , whose fault was it ? " she said , and laughed . I blew out the smoke and took time to ponder her question to me . I felt wise and in control , for some reason . I felt like the woman sitting in front of me was patient and on my side , like she was willing to wait the rest of the night if that 's how long it took for me to search for the truest answer I could find . She did n't seem to me like the type who avoided things . She can handle the truth , I remember thinking . " Hey ! " she said , but I kept staring at the boxes of Mel ' s and my things stacked along the wall . " I asked you a question , " she said , leaning forward and smiling at me . It was very quiet in the apartment  --  it was after 3:00 A.M.  --  and at that moment I thought I heard some rustling in the kitchen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it probably was n't what I thought it was , but just then I was sure I knew . I imagined thousands of roaches feasting on the smorgasbord I 'd left all over the kitchen floor and countertops and stove . I pictured ravenous , gigantic roaches nearly the size of my hand scampering all over the room . " Cockroaches infested our home , " I proclaimed . I must have said it rather gravely , because all of a sudden she looked startled and uneasy to me . I stared at her eyes . " Really ? " she said . She bobbed back and forth over her crossed legs and laughed nervously . " What do you mean ? " " We tried everything , " I said solemnly . " We tried cleaning things . We tried exposing them to cold . Nothing worked , " I said . She laughed some more , but I just stared at her until she stopped and then I started talking again . " For a while I reasoned  --  dark ugly creatures that they are  --  that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I leave the lights on in the kitchen and living room at night , they 'll stay away . ' " She nodded and smirked . " Did that help at all ? " she asked . " In a manner of speaking , " I said . " I mean ... it helped in the sense that it helps ... to take medication for a disease for which there 's no known cure . " She uncrossed her legs and stretched them out in front of her . Then she leaned back on her hands with her arms straight behind her propping up her weight and smirked at me again . " Well , had you any prior experience with roaches ? " she said , raising her eyebrows and attempting an English accent . I knew she was making light of me , but the question seemed highly relevant . I took a moment to stare off at the wall and consider it . When I looked back at her , her eyebrows were still raised and she was smiling at me . " No , we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stared at her until she quit grinning at me . " All of it worked to a degree , " I continued , " but roaches have a way of surviving , of enduring where , if faced with similar obstacles , weaker creatures would succumb . You try to expose roaches , you try to bring them out into the light , and they find a dark space where they can hide , a place where they can grow to inconceivable sizes ... and then when it ' s safe for them , they come out again . " " They come out and darken the light of your universe ... the universe of your kitchen , " she said , gesticulating . I should have known she was still playing with me , but I thought she was starting to comprehend the malignance of cockroaches . " That 's right , " I said . " Exactly . And the thing about them is ... " " Wait a minute , wait a minute . Hold on , hold on . " She held up her hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she said , blinking flirtatiously . " Yes , they are . " I stared at her , amazed that she knew . " They are cock roaches , " I said , nodding slowly . " That is the full name . " She giggled and I stared at her with a straight face until she grew somber again . " This is what I was saying , " I said . " This is the thing about cockroaches : The more you try to expose them , the more they hide and fester and grow . You ca n't see them , but you know they 're there somewhere in what you think is your home waiting to come out and pollute it with their darkness . " She picked up the pipe , which she had set down next to her , and tapped inside the bowl lightly with the pad of her finger to pack the marijuana down again . " But you know what 's worse than that ? " I said . She drew on the pipe . " You ca n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the while , they 're multiplying and growing into a much bigger problem than you first had . You can try to kill them one by one . You can sneak up on them and crush their shells under a magazine or book or shoe , but by the time you see there 's a problem , they 've already started festering , they 've already started laying eggs , they 've already started making babies , " I said . " By the time you acknowledge that there 's a problem it 's already too late . " I realized I was leaning forward staring at her and that she wasn ' t looking at me . She was fiddling with the pipe , trying to get it lit again . " That 's the thing about roaches . By the time you 're ready to deal with them it 's already too late , " I said . " I need to go the bathroom , " she said suddenly . Of course I knew that she had been mocking me earlier , but I was believing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was the kind of person who wanted the truth of things . I was still thinking , at that point , that she was compassionate and that she was willing to go the distance with me . " Please do n't go . I mean , if you can stay with me on this , I 'm almost through , " I said . She sat up and crossed her arms over her chest . " You see , what happened here was the roaches came between us  --  here , in this apartment , " I said . " When I tried to expose them they festered and hid . It was always me that was saying , Hey , we have a problem here and we ca n't just ignore it . ' When I 'd try to talk with her about it she 'd say , I 'm busy listening to people who have been fucked in the ass , you take care of them . ' " She put her hands in front of her like she was ready to get up and back away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . She 's a rape counselor , " I insisted . " Who ? " she said . I recalled how Melody used to tell me my brown eyes were convincing so I tried to use them to plead with the woman in front of me . " My ... ahh ... ex-girlfriend , " I said , lying . I pleaded with my eyes . " She counseled rape victims . " This part was true . She crossed her arms in front of her again and squinted at me . I forged ahead . " So I did take care of them , " I said , " or at least I tried to . But you ca n't wage war against an army on your own . You might win a battle here and there , but you 're not going to win a war against something as vile and elusive and malignant as an army of roaches . You 're just not going to , " I said , shaking my head . Obviously the marijuana was having an effect , but I felt I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , " I went on . " When the roaches are in your own house , it takes both of you to confront and conquer them , otherwise some will remain , or their eggs at least , and when the two of you think you 're cruising along having a grand time , you suddenly discover that they have been there breeding all along . They 've been there hiding in the cracks , hiding in your trash , and when they multiply and return their forces are legion , " I said . " They come back as legion , I can tell you that much . Legion , " I said . " Do you know what I mean when I say legion ? " She pursed her lips and shook her head slowly . " No , I do n't , " she said . " Legion , like from the Bible . Many , " I said . She stared at me . " A legion of demons . Like cauldron , except we 're not talking about angels at all , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destructive and harder to contain than that . No , cockroaches are not angels , " I said . " That is , unless you think of them as fallen angels . That may , in fact , be a truer representation of their moral position in the universe , of their moral consciousness . Yes , fallen angels , " I said . I stopped speaking and when I did I realized that , without the sound of my own voice , it was disturbingly quiet in the room . I stared at her and waited for her to say something , but it did n't look like she wanted to say anything to me and , in fact , I was n't sure I wanted her to because she did n't look , if she were to speak , as if she 'd have anything remotely kind or compassionate to say to me . I wanted to believe that this woman who I had thought was patient and caring and desiring of honesty from me only a few minutes before was still all of those things , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked annoyed and impatient . She looked disturbed . She looked like she was through with me . I listened for the roaches in the other room , but I did n't hear anything . " Do you understand any of this ? " I said . Looking back on it now , I realize what she said next should n't have come as a shock to me , but it did . It shocked me horribly . It almost traumatized me . " No , I do n't . I 'm afraid I do n't know what you 're talking about , " she said . She stood up and continued , " Frankly , I thought you seemed like a very nice man , but now all of this is weirding me out . Now I 'm not sure what I think of you . " She walked past the boxes along the near wall and back into the bedroom where the toilet was . There was nothing for me to do but sit there , stoned , and listen to her urinate . It was dead quiet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear . I tried to listen for the rustling sound of the roaches in the kitchen again , but I could n't hear anything over the sound of this woman 's pee pouring into Mel 's and my toilet . When she came out , she went straight past me to get her jacket from the closet . That was her mistake . I do n't blame myself for that . She could have asked me to get her coat for her and I would have . She could have stood up and said , " Well , it 's getting very late , thank you for everything , but I have to get up in the morning and I should be leaving now . " If she ' d have said something like that , I 'd have gotten up and shielded her from what it was that she saw . I 'd have protected her from the trauma of seeing all those roaches on the kitchen floor and counter , I 'd have protected her from seeing those cockroaches all over everything . " Oh my God , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . She brought her hands up next to her head as if she was going to cover her ears or her eyes . She sounded as if she was going to cry . " This is so weird , so creepy , " she said . . I do n't know how many there were . The light was still on in the kitchen , but it 's very possible that by that time the roaches had lost all shame , that they had come out in the light , all of them . However many there were , she looked devastated . They must have been still eating the pizza crust and bagel parts and leftover maki roll , because , oddly , probably without thinking about it , she starting licking her lips with a horribly disgusted look on her face . She turned and looked at me and said , " No , I do n't understand what you 're talking about . I do n't understand and I 'm getting the hell out of here . " She looked at the roaches and grimaced and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems , " she said , shaking her head . I 'm not sure if she expected me to make it better for her just then , if she expected me to apologize or back off of anything I had said , but I did n't . I just stared back at her and tried to work out in my mind how it had gotten to this point , how it was that Mel was gone and this woman was standing in front of me in our apartment causing me to feel pain . " No , of course not . You would n't understand about roaches , " I said .
