<p> The first quasi-professional soccer team in Bay Area history was the United Football Association 's San Francisco Brakick . Honest . Brakick . If I 'm lying , Wikipedia , Answers.com , Cassiopedia and the Reference Encyclopedia are dying . <p> There is no other information on the Brakick , thus the questions " What , and why , is a Brakick ? " is n't addressed , let alone answered . I mean , Earthquakes was available back then , too . <p> It is n't now , of course . Major League Soccer completed its end of the bait and switch that sent San Jose Earthquakes 4.0 to Houston by announcing the creation of Earthquakes 5.0 . Unlike Quakes 4.0 , 5.0 is not going to be a well-built and entertaining champion but an expansionist hodgepodge of second-rate talent designed as an excuse for a real estate development . Enjoy . <p> This was n't the original plan , mind you . When A 's owners John Fisher and Lew Wolff first considered their entry into MLS , it was as part of a grander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ megaplex ( the Q 's and A 's , if you must ) , but San Jose 's political inertia and Wolff 's impatience caused the baseball stadium to be diverted to Fremont , where the political climate might be more clement . <p> Might , we say . We still do n't know if Fremont has the economic will to pull off its end of the deal , just as we do n't know if San Jose is willing to tackle the smaller soccer stadium project . All answers to those questions remain vague , and the word " hopeful " is used too often for comfort . <p> But the main point remains this : If Quakes 5.0 ca n't get that stadium , they will be bundled off to Vancouver , or Calgary , or St. Louis , or somewhere else just as surely as Quakes 4.0 became Houston 1836 two years ago . Houston 1836 became the Houston Dynamo when someone realized that naming a team after the date of Texas ' independence from Mexico might not sit well with the Latino target audience . <p> Either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since they stopped being the Clash in 2000 , were moved because MLS wanted a new stadium in San Jose , which meant essentially that Quakes fans got shafted for a piece of property blackmail . And the blackmail is n't complete yet . <p> That , kids , is the bait-and-switch part , the reason the people who are excited about Quakes 5.0 are being played for suckers . Why this scheme is acceptable to them is beyond us , unless they do n't really care what team they go see as long as it claims at least momentarily to be the One True Earthquakes . <p> There is , you see , no more cynical business combination than sports franchising and commercial real estate . And this is the raison d'etre for Quakes 5.0 , rather than servicing the persistently disenfranchised Bay Area soccer fan . And when we say disenfranchised , we are not just talking about Brakick fans . <p> A comprehensive list of Bay Area ( nine-county ) soccer franchises is not easy to come by , but in addition to the five Quakes teams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Fog , one Frogs , one Buccaneers , one Clippers , one Stompers , one Bay Diablos , one Red Riders , one Red Devils , one All Blacks , one Blues , one Hawks , one Blackhawks , one Night Hawks , one Sky Hawks , one Firebirds , one Falcons , one Golden Eagles , one Gold , one Bay Seals , one Jaguars , one Ambassadors , one Vikings , one Victory , one Pride , one Power , one Quest , one Breakers , one Surf , one Storm , one Sol , one Cyber Rays , one Hydra and one Shockwaves , which might also be Quakes 4.5 if you want to do it that way . There was also a San Francisco team that folded before it got a nickname . <p> There have been teams in San Francisco , Oakland , Fremont , Palo Alto , Redwood City , Sonoma Valley , Montclair and more amorphous ones named Silicon Valley , Golden Bay , Bay Area , East Bay , North Bay , Central California Valley , Salinas Valley , San Joaquin Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Northern California franchises like the Chico Rooks , the Stanislaus County Cruisers , the Sacramento Geckos and the legendary Fresno Fuego . <p> In other words , this is either the best soccer market in the country or the worst soccer market in the country . It is certainly the least permanent . <p> Which brings us back to Quakes 5.0 . We 'd be more willing to embrace the notion of the new team if it were n't such a brazen act of corporate banditry  --  we need your good team , but here 's a bad team to replace it , and you build us a stadium . It makes loan sharking look like bone-marrow donation , and we await in vain some indication that someone is ashamed of the way the fans have been jerked about here . <p> In fact , we await in vain some sense that the soccer audience feels put upon here , used as they have been like walleted piatas . <p> And what we may see is that the audience has moved on . The next generation Quakes fan will come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Beckham , but between the larger catalog of European , Mexican and South American league televised games , and the fact that most soccer experts not paid by MLS see MLS ' level of play as being roughly that of the Dutch Eredivisie , the audience for Quakes 5.0 may turn out to be about the same as 4.0 , 3.0 , 2.0 and 1.0 . A new stadium may give the new team a honeymoon , but it wo n't be long , and history suggests that at some point , someone will start thinking that San Jose does n't deserve this version of their favorite soccer team , either . <p> Or maybe not . Maybe Quakes fans will show up anyway , acquiescent in their own abuse , because they 'll take anything with the right shirt on it . They deserve better , of course . They deserve the team that went to Houston , the one taken from San Jose because the stadium was n't owned by the right folks or located in the right place . <p> But no , what they 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter what the MLS history book says . And if that San Jose stadium does n't get built , it will be gone before you know it , too . <p> But if you 're 115 years old , you 'll always have the Brakick .
