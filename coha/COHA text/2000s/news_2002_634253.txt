Sunday <p> WHEELS : valet ( $5 ) ; wheelchair accessible <p> TRY : escarole and beans ; grilled calamari and octopus , linguine with white clam sauce , veal chop alla Gabe , chocolate mousse cake <p> TIPS : Small yet comfortable storefront affair that goes from bare-top tables at lunch to tablecloths at dinner . Celebrity sightings here are on par with Rosebud , so keep an eye peeled . Reservations are highly recommended , especially for Friday and Saturday nights . Do n't expect anything special in the way of atmosphere ; the food is the thing here . Good for children ( they will go nuts over the spaghetti and meatballs and ravioli ) . Not much in the way of wines , but there are enough choices to take care of whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Owner Joey Mondelli has a long history of turning out wonderful Italian food at prices that are most reasonable . The eclectic crowd that fills up this small space ( especially on weekends ) creates a certain brand of energy that flows back and forth between the two small dining rooms . It 's as simple as saying " a good time can be had by all . " <p> And the Italian eats go on . ( Yes , I am trying to prove a point . ) The crowd at La Scarola on West Grand is as thick as it has ever been ( at both lunch and dinner ) . And consider yourself lucky if you snag a reservation for , say , 7:30 on a Friday or Saturday night . Yes , I saw an empty table here one day at lunch , but that was on a Tuesday at 1:30 p.m. , just about the time the neighborhood lunch crowd had its fill and moved on . In a few hours , though , the place would be filled again , every one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Scarola is as far apart from Rosebud on Rush as Milan is from Chicago . The two dining rooms are small , the tables are tight upon one another , and there is not much I can say about the trappings , other than there are n't any to speak of . The walls are covered with pictures of local , regional and national celebrities ( over the years , owner Joey Mondelli has fed celebrities from around the world ) . The floors are a mishmash of different materials , and there is no ceiling to speak of ( well , there is one up there , but you know what I mean ) . <p> La Scarola is pretty much a restaurant designer 's nightmare come to life . But what difference does it make ? The food is excellent , the service is swift and sure , and there is fun in the air here ( as in people enjoying themselves to the limit ) . This is absolutely the only restaurant in the city where I am apt to run into one of my doctors or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know about their lifestyle , they could easily afford to be spooling their pasta over at Spiaggia or Coco Pazzo . <p> La Scarola may not be as classy or polished as Rosebud on Rush , but the essence , the soul of what Italian food is all about , is here . I believe that La Scarola practices a philosophy central to all good restaurants ( Italian or otherwise ) , that customers do not like surprises , and that higher prices do not necessarily guarantee a really great meal ( they should , but it does n't always come out that way ) . <p> I almost always order one of the escarole dishes at La Scarola ( the restaurant 's name is a corruption of escarole , in case you did n't know ) . The escarole sauteed with garlic and oil is silky and robust . Add cannelloni beans and a touch of chicken broth to the basic sauteed escarole , and you have , yes , a rustic and robust dish of escarole and beans ( with crusty Italian bread it becomes a meal for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is the previous dish but with a lot more broth . OK , too much broth  --  way too much . This is not one of my favorite escarole creations here . <p> Those are some of the appetizers , but if you do n't care for escarole , then I would definitely suggest , should it be on the menu , the grilled octopus or the grilled calamari . One night the kitchen did a combo of those two for me , and it was an incredible bit of cookery . Those two denizens of the deep , arranged on a bed of romaine and leaf lettuce ( kind of a seaweed idea ) , were glossed with olive oil and herbs and grilled to a tender turn . Especially tender and enjoyable was the octopus . <p> On the zuppa end of things , probably one of the best pasta e fagioli around ( right up there with the Rosebud version ) can be found here . This pasta and bean soup romps with the simple flavors of chicken stock and basil , but in overall substance it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become a light meal . <p> Pasta dishes are quite good . One day at lunch I had the " macaroni arrabbiata . " For the very pleasing price of just $6.95 , I enjoyed the creative company of a platter of rigatoni that had been crowned with layers of fresh mozzarella , all in a zingy arrabbiata ( marinara sauce juiced up with crushed red peppers ) that had been enhanced with fresh basil . A terrific dish . <p> Linguine and clams were incredibly delicious . I prefer the white version over the red ( sauces ) . I propose that it is the simplicity of this dish that makes it so inviting . Put it all together on a large oval platter  --  linguine , olive oil , garlic , crushed red pepper flakes , chopped clams , fresh cherrystone clams  --  and you have enjoyment on a level that makes you want to finish the whole thing , right down to the last bit of clam . <p> Pollo pasquinelli became an interesting choice one night . Four nice fillets of boneless chicken breast were layered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chopped tomatoes . Flavors were coming at me from every direction , but it was the clever idea of gorgonzola crumbles sprinkled across the chicken ( the cheese melting just a bit from the heat of the cooked chicken ) that made the dish jump with flavor . <p> I will let the menu description of " veal chop alla Gabe " speak for itself : " 10-ounce veal chop pounded paper thin , breaded , pan fried and finished with garlic , parsley , lemon and extra-virgin olive oil and set over diced Italian potatoes . " I could n't have said it better myself , but I will add my two cents by saying that this was beautiful eating from start to finish . <p> I should note that in addition to the aforementioned escarole , the other green that I go for here is the rapini . Sauteed with olive oil and garlic , this is another fine and flavorful way to get your vitamins . <p> Desserts are the usual for casual Italian restaurants of this caliber : cannoli , spumoni , cheesecake and Italian ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cake , and I can highly recommend this rich and flavorful cake . However , if you are thinking lighter might be better at this point , then ask for some fresh watermelon . <p> Pat Bruno is a local free-lance writer , critic and author .
