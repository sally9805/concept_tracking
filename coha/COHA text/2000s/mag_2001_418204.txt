BASEBALL Headnote The Mariners won more games than any American League team In history . WIN that get them past the Yankees ? Do n't count on it . // Congratulations , Seattle . You 've just won 8 zillion games , more than all but one team in the history of the major leagues . You 've got it all : offense , defense , starting pitching , a running game , a bullpen deeper than Bill Gates ' pockets , the best balance in baseball . Nice goin : Soon , this will be your reward : the Yankees . The defending-champion Yankees . The three- time defending champion Yankees . And as the playoffs begin , you are n't even the favorite to reach the World Series . Sounds more like a booby prize , does n't it ? You win all those games and what does it get you ? A big fat nothing  --  except home-field advantage in the A.L . playoffs . And home-field advantage does n't mean diddly squat against the Yankees . How 's that grab you ? Ask anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful regular season does n't amount to a hill of beans come the playoffs , especially now , with starting shortstop Carlos Guillen lost for at least part of the playoffs after contracting tuberculosis . To win the Series , any team must go through New York . Not Seattle . " The Yankees always seem to be so resilient , " says the Red Sox 's David Cone , an ex-Yankee who knows how that team works in the postseason . " They 're still the team to beat . With all due respect to Seattle and the great year they 're having , the World Series means getting past the Yankees . " To do that , the Mariners will have to go through the Indians first , of course , and the Yankees will have to beat the As in this week 's divisional playoff round . But Yankees-Mariners is the ALCS matchup on everybody 's mind . The Yankees are out there waiting for you , Seattle-not that you do n't know that already . " We may have to play them and beat them to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mariners ' catalyst and star . " I do not want to avoid them . I just want to do it and beat them and get through it . " Listen up , Oakland , because this goes for you , too . You put together a nifty little second half , better even than the Mariners ' ' . Overall , you had the second-best record in the majors and were the hottest team in baseball going into the playoffs . You 've got three of the best young starting pitchers in the business in Mark Mulder , Barry Zito and Tim Hudson . So what do you get ? The Yankees , those same damn Yankees . In the first round . You get only five games to prove you 're better . Some prize . // Here 's Cone again : " Oakland 's kids are great They 're the future . They match up well . I still believe that in big games , it comes down to the pitching , to the starting pitching and then a great closer . The thing is , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now . The Yankees definitely have the edge , one through four . Have a swell time , guys . Write if you get work . The American League playoffs promise to be the best in years . Somebody in Houston or St. Louis or Phoenix might argue this point , but the three best teams in baseball play in the A.L . this season . And the fourth A.L . team , Cleveland , ai n't no slouch . Say Indians starters Bartolo Colon , C.C. Sabathia and Chuck Finley get hot at the right time . Who 's to say Cleveland is n't suddenly a Fall Classic team ? Led by Roberto Alomar , Jim Thome and Juan Gonzalez , the Indians ' offense never has been much of a question . Still , up against the other three A.L . playoff clubs , Cleveland seems like an afterthought , a throw-in . Whoever survives this demolition derby in the American League easily could find the World Series to be a big ol ' burst balloon of a comedown . What ? We just beat Gonzalez 's Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Series , the biggest stage in baseball and this is who we play ? Julio Franco 's Braves ? ? ? ! ! ! The World Series , an anticlimax ? That 's the way it shapes up . Here 's the thing about the American League playoffs : If somebody does n't beat New York this year , when is it going to happen ? Between Seattle and Oakland , the Yankees ' competition this October is the strongest it has been since New York began this dynasty back in 1996 . It is n't likely the American League will put up another two teams against New York that are this formidable any time in the near future . Both the Mariners and the As won more than 100 games this year . In the Yankees ' past four World Series championship seasons , they never met a team in the A.L . playoffs that had won more than 95 regular-season games . In their World Series matchups , the only team New York played that had more than 100 wins was the 1999 Braves , who had 103 that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New York seemed vulnerable last year and still won . The Yankees wormed into the 2000 playoffs by losing 15 of their last 18 regular-season games , yet they beat Oakland in the Division Series , beat Seattle in the ALCS , then beat the Mets in the World Series . That 's why neither the M 's nor the As should be favored this time around , even if on paper each looks extremely strong . " You just hope that when you get to the postseason , you make somebody beat you , " Yankees manager Joe Torre explains . " If you do n't get through it , you at least want to play well and make somebody beat you . " If we 've learned anything about the Yankees over the years , it 's that they do n't beat themselves in October . That 's the reason they 're still the favorites . Devil Rays ' catcher John Flaherty remembers playing against the ' ' 98 Yankees , who won 114 regular-season games and then swept the Padres in the World Series , this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had the ability to step it up to another level , to just say , OK we need to go out and get two or three runs : When you 're competing against a team like that and you know you have to play your best baseball for every inning and every pitch , it can be awfully deflating to find out they still have another gear to go to . " And does Flaherty see any similarities in the 2001 Mariners , whose 116 wins this season broke the American League record set by those ' ' 98 Yankees ? " Not really , " he says . " It does n't seem like they play that way . With the Mariners , it 's hardball from the first pitch . It 's just good baseball . They 're obviously very consistent through the course of a game and the course of a season . " It 's possible the Mariners " win total will work against them in the playoffs . Here 's a cautionary tale from Torre , for instance , about the first round of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meeting during a game in Texas . We were tighter than a drum . I called a handful of my players down in the runway behind the dugout and said , Look , we 're leading two games to none , but you 're playing out there like somebody has handcuffs on you . Just go out and do the best you can . If it 's not good enough , it 's not good enough . ' ' " Of course , let 's not discount the possibility that the Yankees simply are applying a little gamesmanship here . Do you think , for instance , that veteran outfielder Paul O'Neill might have a matchup with the Mariners in mind when he says of his own team 's record-breaking season : " That 's the most pressure I ever felt , because of what we accomplished in the regular season . It does n't mean anything unless you win the World Series . " Or how about his teammate Jorge Posada 's take : " I think if you win 114 games , you 've got a lot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that those 114 wins were n't a fluke . " Chances are , Posada wo n't mind if the Mariners see that quote . Photograph O'Neill knows all about October pressure and seems all too willing to tell Seattle what it 's like . // Not only leaves fall Photograph In the end , Tinker , Evers , Chance and the 1906 Cubs were not even the best team in Chicago . Sidebar Max factors Sidebar The A 's cleanup spot , Yankee Stadium 's contours , Arthur Rhodes ' accessorizing . What factors , aside from the Bronx mystique , will be the main determinants of this year 's A.L . champ ? Sidebar 1 . The Dye Factor . In the A 's first-round loss to the Yankees a year ago , Oakland used a revolving door at the cleanup spot : Ben Grieve , Eric Chavez , Sidebar Olmedo Saenz . This year , Jermaine Dye is anchored there . Watch how much of a difference he makes to the pitches Jason Giambi , the 3-hole hitter , sees . 2 . The Setup Factor . Through their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike Stanton and Jeff Nelson to pave the path to Mariano Sidebar Rivera . Now , Nelson is a Mariner . The eighth-inning outings of Nelson for the M 's and Stanton for the Yankees figure to give those teams an edge over the A 's setup-by-committee trio of Jeff Tam , Mike Magnante and Jim Mecir and the Indians ' pick-'em group of John Rocker , Danys Baez , Paul Shuey and David Riske . Sidebar 3 . The Southpaw Factor . This applies on a lot of levels . A lefty pitching in Yankee Stadium is always a plus . For that reason , Oakland 's Barry Zito and Mark Mulder are keys . For that matter , Andy Pettitte figures to get an early start in any series in which New York has home-field advantage . And any team that plays the A 's needs lefties to counter Jason Giambi , Eric Chavez , Johnny Damon and Terrence Long . Of the four A.L . playoff teams , the Indians ' winning percentage against lefthanded starters is the worst ; Seattle 's is the best . 4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more bases this year than any other teams in the American League . The Indians and the A 's are leadfoots . Only Boston stole fewer bases . 5 . The Earring Factor . The first-round series between the Mariners and the Indians is ripe for Jewelry-gate Redux . Remember the postgame tirade earlier this season by Mariners reliever Arthur Rhodes after the Indians ' Omar Vizquel complained about the glint from Rhodes ' earring ? " A short little hitter like him ... a little midget . I 'm not worried about him , " Rhodes said ; " I 'll go right at him if I face him . You think I 'm scared of him ? " - M.K .
