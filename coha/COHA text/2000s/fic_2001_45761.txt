Steve Popkes is probably best known as a science fiction writer . His novel Caliban Landing was sf told from an alien 's point of view . His short fiction has appeared primarily in Asimov 's SF magazine and he was one of the key writers in the Future Boston project that came out a few years ago . However , his first story for us is pure fantasy , a ghost story that rings true through and through . <p> TOM KELLEY HIMSELF BUILT the house to be a brothel in 1901 . The Burts bought the house in the thirties . They sold it to the Smiths in the 1980s . We purchased it from the Smiths . My wife and I loved it . Nothing fazed us . Nothing even brought down our spirits . When the basement turned out to be not merely damp , but to have a spring-fed stream flowing under the oil tank , we watched the sump pump with a strange fondness as it ran feverishly at all hours of the night . When I found frogs coming up out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt a benign presence in the house , a friendly spirit . Once we owned the house , we decided it was time to start a family . We thought it would be easy . After all , humans have been doing it for millions of years . How difficult could it be ? Instead , we ended up in the Country of the Fertility Doctors . First , there was the year or so to come to the notion there was a problem . After that , there was the first round of surgeries , then the drugs , then the second round of surgeries , then more drugs , then stronger drugs , then real , no-kidding-around , possibly serious side-effects , multiple injections exactly at 9:00 P.m. , with different kinds for different parts of the cycle , drugs . There were the attempts . First , the natural , then with different " helping " methods , until finally we were up at dawn and I was holding her hand in the operating theater as they removed her ova . Then , back to the Magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the OR to put the resulting cluster of cells back in . Please wait two weeks and we 'll tell you it did n't work . This was the closest thing to war I 'd ever experienced . Like war , it left us hollow-eyed and empty , bereft of spirit . The history of the house became a cruel irony . Compulsively , I read about Tom Kelley and the house he made . I became obsessed with the history of the house , its women and its men . It was during this time that I began to find little bits of debris around the porch and under the old hemlock out front . A cigarette butt . Neither of us smoked . A piece of worn stone . A bit of ceramic from an old electrical terminal . Flotsam and jetsam surfacing from the past , I thought initially . Every old house is a midden and the trash eventually works its way out of the soil into the light of day . Still , the butts looked fresh to me and the worn stone looked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of offering . Kids , I figured , unwilling to think it might be anything else . Finally , as unmistakable and unbelievable as morning , one of the procedures worked . My wife told me when I got home . Being so informed is not unlike being in a slow-motion train wreck . That night , long after she had gone to bed , I stared out the window , watching the stars wheel overhead , wondering what had happened to me . It was early winter , long past the time for fireflies , but I saw a light floating near the porch . It moved like the lit end of a cigarette in the hands of a man . I stared closely but saw no one but the small light . I remembered the feeling I 'd had of a benign presence when we first moved in . I looked away and back again and there was a man sitting on the porch . I put on a coat and went out and sat beside him . The light of the cigarette was his . He turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , gaunt and shadowed as if dirty , stubbled and pale like black weeds growing through snow , dark eyes beneath an old slouch hat . He was dressed in an old jacket and pants , and he crouched as he sat , which made him look small . For all of that , there was a sense of size about him , and the feel of lost power like a sick and aging criminal or a vagabond king . The air was clear and bitterly cold and the thin snow on the ground was lit by a half moon . I could hear the undersides of the snow crack into ice and freeze to the ground . I could hear my breathing and the clicks and knockings as the trees contracted with the night . The snow itself had a soft sandy sound as it settled , cooling after being warmed by the day . All the world was making an acoustic transition from day to late night , including me . My companion had no sound to him . He smelled of smoke and I could see his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of him . Perhaps , that 's what makes a ghost : someone who can not be held within all the senses but only one or two . He stared at me , waiting , and I told him his story . TOM KELLEY WAS not born in Hopkinton . No one , in fact , ever truly knew where he hailed from . He showed up in Hopkinton in spring of 1899 , young but of indeterminate age . No one knew why . He came in late at night and slept in the commons until dawn . Then , he banged on Mrs. Bowker 's rooming house until she let him in . There he stayed . He did n't speak of his past . His very mystery excited people . He had little talent , it seemed , save his charm - which was considerable . Tom Kelley could charm the legs off a mule , so they said . Other descriptions , usually involving local young women , were less than savory . Still , no harm ever came to him . Kelley stayed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going for long walks up north toward Southborough . Folks in Hopkinton thought Southborough one notch up on the cultural scale and therefore disliked the town . This did n't bother Southborough much since the population of that town shared the same opinion . Southborough stood as the beginning of the larger industrial mill towns north of Hopkinton : Southborough , Marlborough , Hudson . South of Hopkinton was farm country though there were small mills everywhere . The land between Hopkinton and Southborough stretched ten miles wide and about thirty miles long , starting from the east end of Framingham and reaching west nearly to Worcester . It was composed of rickety farms and unknown woods . Tough characters lived there . Bodies had been found and folks had disappeared without explanation in that little thirty-mile stretch of forest . Dirt roads linked little village to little village and the railroad cut through the heart of it . When Tom Kelley went walking north , some were afraid for him , some were hoping he would n't return , and some were unsurprised . In spring of 1901 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house . By fall of 1902 he finished it . It was on the road to Cordaville , a wide spot in the dirt lane with little to recommend it , and was on the top of a hill that had once been used for pasture . Down the hill from the house ran the train tracks . The following winter , he opened for business . The Boston outbound trains made an unscheduled stop at the foot of his hill where Tom 's wagon waited for them . Kelley 's clients rode the wagon up the hill and , usually , spent the night . The next morning the same wagon took those clients back down the hill and the inbound train returned them to Boston . Some folks in Hopkinton did n't like having a brothel in town and talked about closing him down . One brave soul suggested the house be burnt to the ground and went so far as to take a gang on a raid . Kelley was waiting for him with two cold-eyed , professionally armed men who clearly had no compunction about shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its own accord . The following year there was talk about closing him down again , about taking the matter to the statehouse . This remained talk and the year after that there was no talk at all . The Tom Kelley House had become part of the landscape . Though when it was discussed , as it was on more than one occasion , it was said that Kelley must have made a deal with the devil to get that railway stop . So the situation remained through the Great War , into Prohibition and deep into the heart of the Roaring Twenties . The night he celebrated his forty-fifth birthday was on a Sunday , since Sunday was the only day the house was closed . This was more because of lack of business rather than any spiritual leanings Tom might have had . That night he boasted to a friend as they were drinking that he had never been in love . Tom maintained at length that sex was like some charge of electricity . ( He 'd recently installed a generator and electric lighting in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The charge built up and had to be bled off properly and regularly or men might explode like broken transformers into thievery , violence , and murder . " I 'm performing a public service , " he said stoutly . " I 'm keeping down all manner of crime just by making my girls available at reasonable rates . " The friend , a younger man by the name of Gerald Monahan , agreed that Tom 's house was public and a service and said no more than that , since as a friend he received a significant discount on the food and drink and to say otherwise might jeopardize Tom 's good graces . The following day Tom sat on the verandah , nursing an aching hangover and trying to remember all that had occurred the night before . This had become something of a recent preoccupation when he drank ; as his capacity lessened , in this and in other appetites , he had grown concerned he was getting old . The thought was a novel one to him and he had been considering it , thinking over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A young woman walked the dirt track that split off from Cordaville Road to his house and past it down to the railroad . He heard her long before he saw her for she had sewn bells into her valise , a common practice in the area to prevent thievery and to keep off the devil . Tom was , as always , the first up since he could not sleep past dawn . So he watched her from the shadowy silence of his house and the long still summer morning . There was still dew on the grass and the night before had been unseasonably cool , though the day promised to be hot . The result was that Tom 's body was pleasantly confused between warmth and coolness . He found himself wanting a cup of coffee . This gave him hope he might live a little while longer . She must be a cousin to somebody down across the tracks , he thought , scratching the hair on his belly . Or maybe she means to walk all the way to Westborough looking for a job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick and her teeth too prominent . But her skin was fair and freckled and her cheeks were round and gave an Old World charm to her face . Tom glanced at her body and visualized her without clothes . Lean , he conjectured , with some light padding in the thighs and thin pubic hair . Small breasts , close together , with small , pale nipples . Tom had been in business for a long time and sized up women the way a farmer examined livestock or a foreman observed the size and strength of his men . The girl turned into his walk and came up to him on the verandah . " Mister Kelley ? " she said . " Yes . " He leaned back in his chair . " I 've come to work for you . My name 's Maggie Bowker . " He stared down at her . He 'd never hired locally , preferring to acquire girls from the cities where the practice had a more established history . " I see , " he said slowly . " You 're from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elisabeth Bowker ? She used to run the rooming house there . " " I 'm her daughter . " " Why do you want to work for me ? " She looked at him steadily . " That 's where the money is , is n't it ? And are n't you fairer about it than most ? " Tom nodded reluctantly . " Come on in . We 'll have a cup of coffee . " So , Maggie came to stay . AT FIRST , she was treated the same as the other girls . A few weeks after she 'd come to the house , Tom rose at dawn to music . Like most such houses , there was a piano in the front room . On Saturday nights , a piano player came in and spun out tunes for the waiting gentlemen , encouraging drinking , singing , and other kinds of foreplay . This morning , he heard a darker , more delicate and somber melody . One he recognized . " That 's Moonlight Sonata , " he said when Maggie was finished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of music . " " I know that , too . " He looked at her for a long time . " Your mother told you that ? " She nodded . " And other things . I 've come to sleep with you , Tom Kelley . To touch you with my mouth and fingers and make gentle love to you until you have no other alternative but to love me . " He raised his eyebrows . " Then what ? " " Then your course should be obvious . " " I do n't sleep with my employees . It 's a rule . " " That 's a lie , " she said hotly . " Half the women here have been your lovers . " " It 's a rule now , " he said quietly . " Keep playing . You sound nice . " So , he put her on weekends like some of his special girls . Maggie did well at the house . Over time , she had her regulars and her friends . Tom protected his employees as best he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their clients . Prostitution is rarely what one might call good work , but Tom made it as easy as possible . Over that year , Tom did not sleep with her , nor with any of the other girls . This was unusual . Tom was a man of appetites and he was used to getting them satisfied on a regular basis . I do n't think either of them could have given a reason . It came down to a competition between them who would succumb first . Maggie had youth and strength . Tom had deceit and guile . No one had much illusion who would win . A year to the day from when she first arrived , she came to his office wearing her most subtly erotic dress . It was morning and she brought him some coffee . " So , old man , " she said affectionately . " It 's been a hard year for you , not sleeping with anybody . Do n't you think you 've toughed it out enough ? " She leaned over to give him a long look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unguarded moment . Truth to say , Tom was tempted . It had been a year surrounded by soft flesh and the smell of sin . Chastity was not one of his virtues . For the first time , he was glad he was past his youth . Had he been twenty , or even thirty , he would never have made it . " I 'm going for a walk , " he said suddenly and stood up . " I 'll be back later . Tell the others . " He walked down Cordaville Road , crossed the river , and walked upstream past the old millpond . Then he stepped into the forest . The borderlands that stretched between Worcester and Boston were not like the dense , mythical forests of Europe or even the freshly discoveyed forests of the New World . Both of those forests were long gone . These borderlands were an accident of industry and human migration . They were not completely forested nor were they particularly old . Every hillside had been clear-cut at one time or another since the Pilgrims . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned farms , meadows , and forests . The oaks remained and upstart maples were growing now where chestnuts had been destroyed by the blight . The elms , often more than a hundred feet tall and shaped like joyous , photographically arrested fountains , still towered over the roadways , occasional broad open meadows , and forest . Thus , the wood Tom turned into was dark and overgrown with moss , and dangerous , but gave only the illusion of age . Tom had watched much of the reclamation in the twenty years he had been running his house . He followed a faint path as much by feel as by sight . After a time , he could smell wood smoke and the sour smell of homemade whiskey . The trail widened and poured into a clearing beneath an immense elm . The trunk of the elm was six feet thick . Its symmetrical shape was marred by limbs that had broken off from storms in years past to give the appearance of a montage of younger trees grafted onto an ancient root . Beneath the tree was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sawn raw from newly felled trees . Over time they had split against each other and the cracks had been filled with mud or cement . The roof was similarly built . The house gave the impression of a wasp 's nest made intimate with broken trees . An old dog was sleeping in front of the door . Tom squatted and patted his head . " Good boy . How are you doing , Fowler ? " he said softly . Fowler grinned and went back to sleep . " Jake ? " Tom stood up and called . " You around here ? " " Up here . " Tom looked up and saw a small old man about forty feet up sitting on a thick limb . He held a jug in his hands . " What are you doing up there ? " Jake shrugged . " Do n't rightly know . Got drunk last night and found myself here . Seemed like the place to be at the time . " " Why do n't you come down ? " " There you go again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the way . " Always trying to make things go the way you think they ought to go . Why do n't you come up here ? " " I want to talk to you . " " Then talk . " " Down here . " " Hope . " Tom looked around exasperated . " I 'm forty-five . I 'm too old to climb trees . " " I 'm near seventy . I 'm too old to argue with you . " " Damn , " he said with feeling . He judged he 'd start with the lowest limb but slipped and fell back . " Start on the next one , " advised Jake . " It 's easier . " Tom did so and in a few minutes , breathing heavily , he was sitting on a limb adjacent to Jake . Wordlessly , Jake handed him the jug . Tom took a swig , choked and wiped his eyes , then handed it back . " Jesus , " he muttered , wiping his eyes . A quarter stick of dynamite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startling clarity . " Good batch . " Jake sipped at the jug . " Yeah . I let this one age a week or so . " He held the jug against his belly . " This is for export if you want it . I boiled off the wood alcohol and everything . " He pursed his lips . " Pity . I kind of like that methanol taste . " " It 'll kill you . " " I ai n't dead yet . Besides , it 's in the cards that you 'll be dead before me . I 'll have to bury you . " Tom looked at him sharply . " How do you figure ? " Jake sipped at the jug and did n't answer . " So , " said Jake after a few minutes . " What do you need ? " " Nothing . I needed a break . " " Horseshit . You never come all the way out here just to pass wind . This about the new girl ? " " How 'd you know about her ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . News does n't travel that fast out here in the woods , but it does travel . I heard . Heard she 's popular , too . Popular enough for the likes of you . " " I have n't been with her . " " Nor with anyone else , , I hear . " He cackled . " You must be so damned horny the crack of dawn ai n't safe around you . " Tom stared down at the ground . " I 've been better , " he confessed . " So sleep with somebody . " " It 's not that simple . " " You sleep with somebody else then you have to explain why you wo n't sleep with Maggie . She 's Beth Bowker 's daughter , eh ? She your daughter too ? " " No . " " Why not ? She could be . Ai n't no secret about you and Beth . " " It 's a secret from her husband . " " Maybe not even him . " Tom shrugged and shook his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him with a puzzled expression . " Then , why not ? " " It 's my business . " " Sleep with Betty , then . Or Veronique . And tell Maggie that . " Tom shook his head again . " Then why the hell did you come out here ? " " You 're always good to talk to . Besides , I have to keep in contact with my suppliers . " Jake chuckled again . The day had become warm so he leaned forward and took off his shirt . The hair of his chest was as gray as his head . He scratched it , pulled out one and looked at it . " I have n't made a batch for you in years . Besides , Prohibition 's going to be repealed . In about ten years . " " That 's ten years of profit , old man . " Jake looked at him speculatively . " You might make it that far . You 're forty-six , right ? " " Forty-five . " " You might make fifty-five . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on about today ? Why are you so goddamned morbid ? If you 're so goddamned smart , what the hell am I going to goddamned die of ? " Jake grinned . " You should n't swear . It does n't come naturally to you . You repeat yourself . " " Fuck you . " Jake leaned toward him . " You 're going to die because of her . " Tom started as if stung . " Who ? Maggie ? " Jake nodded . " With her you have drunk your death . " " What does that mean ? " Jake leaned back against the tree and did n't answer . " What ? " Tom persisted . " Do you mean I might lose the house ? That the upstanding citizens of Hopkinton might finally run me out of town ? " He thought for a minute . " I can deal with that . Or do you mean she 's going to kill me or that maybe I 'll die because of something she did ? " No answer . " Okay , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do tell . " " Or do you mean something worse ? " Tom threw up his hands . " That I might burn in hell fire . Because of her . " He spat contemptuously . " I can deal with that , too . " " Good for you . You 're the one who made the deal with the devil , " " I did n't , " Tom said , suddenly uneasy . " I made a deal with Honey Fitz - and then Michael Curley . Do you think I 'd sell my soul for a lousy railroad connection ? " Jake shrugged . " It 's a different world these days . You do n't sell all of your soul to the devil . Just controlling interest . " " You 're a fine one to talk . Who 's making hooch ? " " For medicinal purposes only . " " Yeah . Right . Besides , there is no devil . There is no God . Nothing up there but the sun and the dark . " Jake nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you here ? " Tom poked him on the shoulder . " To have this conversation , I suppose . But , I think you 're right . " " About what ? " " It 's not Maggie 's business why I wo n't sleep with her . I 'll sleep with Betty . Or Veronique . To hell with Maggie . " He slipped off the tree . " Thanks . You always set me straight . " " You 're welcome , " Jake called after him . " Next time remind me what we 're talking about . " Tom came back to the house a changed man . He went upstairs with Veronique ( whose real name was Ethel ) and spent a good afternoon with her . Maggie did n't take it well , though she did n't say anything . She just looked sad . Each of the girls had their regulars , as I said . Tom charged each girl a flat fee for an encounter and collected the money from the women . The girls kept their own tips and anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls made good money with this arrangement and after a few years moved to Chicago , or further West , where no one knew them and they could set themselves up without scrutiny . But some girls had favorites they did n't like charging and paid Tom 's fee for them . This was sex for love , rather than money , and it cost them . Maggie fell for a charming but worthless young man by the name of Derek Kenny . He was as charming as Tom had been in his youth but without Tom 's sense . He went through Maggie 's money in about four months and then disappeared . Maggie was heartbroken . She was morose and brooding for about six weeks , then one day she disappeared . Tom asked the girls , of course . They did n't have any idea where she had gone . They knew why , though . Maggie was pregnant . She 'd gone off to find Derek . Tom went into town and asked Elisabeth Bowker , Maggie 's mother . Elisabeth saw him briefly . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't profitable . Tom returned to the house knowing no more than before . After a few days wrestling with himself , he walked back into the woods to the old elm tree . " You do n't want to find her , " called out Jake when he came into sight . Tom held his tongue and saved his breath for the last climb of the hill . " Why not ? " " I told you last time : She 's your death . " " I told you last time : I 'll take that chance . Where is she ? " Jake was sitting on a stump in front of his shack . He looked up at Tom speculatively . " What the hell do you want with her ? " " That 's my business . " " Did you sleep with her ? " " No . " Jake shook his head . " She your daughter ? " " No . " Tom sighed . " I told you that last time . " " Do n't fuck with me ! " Jake shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from . I know where you been . I know why you 're in that house . I know where the bodies are buried . If Maggie Bowker ai n't your daughter , she could have been . Is she ? " " No . " " Then why ? " Tom ignored him and stared . Jake fidgeted . " Why ask me ? " he whined . " I 'm just an old man . I 'm out here just listening to the owls and the wind . " " I know better than that . " Jake laughed and stood up . " True . I do n't know where she is . But she went from your place into town . " " How do you know ? " " I heard it from the wind and the owl , " Jake said irritably . " Where in Boston ? " " How the hell should I know ? Ask your friend . " Jake grinned . " Ask the devil . " TOM TOOK the train in . In the years since he 'd moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a hundred times . He remembered when the trolley line downtown had been buried , tunneling down beneath the city as if crawling through catacombs . He remembered coming into Boston feeling ancient among all of the young soldiers on their way to France though he was only a few years older . He remembered coming into town to pay his respects to Honey Fitzpatrick when Fitzpatrick announced he was quitting the mayor 's office and running for Congress and threw a party for all of the Irish in town . Later that same year , Tom had come back into town for another party , this time for the new mayor , Michael Curley . Tom 's house depended on the largesse and protection of such men , of similar men in Framingham and Worcester , of the state railroad commissioners and others . Tom knew them all . Still , it 's not good for business for the owner of a good-sized whorehouse and speakeasy from outside of town to call directly on the mayor of Boston . Instead , Tom started with a ward boss he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know either Derek Kenny or Maggie Bowker but sent him to a police sergeant named Smitty in Jamaica Plains . Smitty did n't know either personally but suggested he speak with the police captain at the station in Scollay Square . Captain Tripp had met Derek once , a while back , and had heard he 'd been throwing money around in the North End and sent Tom to meet with a Sicilian named , of all things , Bobby . Bobby was short and nervous . He met Tom in a basement restaurant in the North End . Tom bought him some lunch . Bobby would n't speak with him for several minutes and instead toyed with the food . Finally , he sat back and said : " I 'll tell you the truth , Mister Kelley . Just because Captain Tripp sent you to me . He and I have an understanding . Yeah , I know Derek Kenny . I know Maggie Bowker . I 'm not going to tell you where they are . Derek 's always been smooth as Chinese silk with the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nasty when you cross him . " " Maggie 's pregnant by him , " said Tom quietly , knowing the truth of that was far from certain . " I 'm trying to look out for her . " Bobby shook his head . " Let her look out for herself . That 's the safest thing . You go poking into Derek 's business and you 'll find yourself owning some new holes . " " Where can I find him ? " " Do n't ask me . Ask somebody better protected . " Bobby laughed . " You could ask Curley . I bet he 'd know . " James Michael Curley 's presence was protected by his secretary , a slight young man studying a series of legal documents when Tom entered the office . Tom gave him a note for Curley and a five-dollar bill to ensure its delivery and then went to Lonigan 's , an Irish tavern down the street in Scollay Square . Tom had a root beer and some fish and chips . The place looked sad . Before Prohibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the girls and the drinks . Now , alcohol supported the house . Often , a man coming in from off the street had to choose between a girl and a drink . A good portion of the time the drink won . As profitable as things were for Tom , he still longed for the day he could buy a beer in the open . A pint to go with his fish and chips seemed a distant dream . Root beer just did n't make the grade . Two hours passed until Curley came into the tavern . " Can I buy you a pint , Mister Mayor ? " Tom asked politely , holding up the remains of his root beer . " Thank you . I appreciate your thoughtfulness in allowing me to meet you discreetly . " Curley sat back in his chair . Tom admired him frankly , from his spotless suit to his jeweled stickpin . " I 'm honored you 'd see me at all , sir . " " Nonsense . We 've known each other a long time . You helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yours was the greater help , " said Tom . " I have a small hope you could help me again . " " What 's the problem ? " " One of my girls has run off and I 'm trying to find her . " Curley frowned . " It 's better to let them go , Tom . Bringing back an unwilling girl to your house is tantamount to white slavery . Besides , it 's bad for business . Does she owe you money ? " Tom shook his head . " No . I 'm looking for her because I think she might be in trouble - actually , she is in trouble . She 's pregnant by one of her clients . " Curley looked puzzled . " She ran off with him ? That seems a problem solved to me . " " She did n't run off with him . She ran off to find him . Derek Kenny . I 've tried to find him myself . Eventually I was sent to you . " Curley 's face clouded and he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem to be forgotten , not solved . My advice is to forget it . Forget the girl . Forget the baby . If she 's taken up with Kenny , there 's not much hope for her . " " My impression of Kenny was not particularly malignant , " said Tom mildly . " Then why are you looking for him ? " Curley snorted . " You must have sensed something about the man to think the girl might be in danger . Who is this girl , anyway ? " " Margaret Bowker . " " Elisabeth Bowker 's daughter ? " " Your memory always astonishes me , sir . " Curley did n't reply . Instead , he carefully pulled a cigar from his pocket and began the ritual of preparing it to be smoked . " Is she your daughter ? " " You 're the second person to ask that . You know that can not be true . " " So I 'd thought . But how else to explain your behavior ? I know you too well to think you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held it for some seconds to let the sulfur bum off , then lit the cigar . Sweet rolls of smoke wreathed his head as he , puffed . Tom shrugged . " What can you tell me about Kenny ? " Curley leaned back . " Derek Kenny is Frank Kenny 's son . Frank helped me in my first election and I made him a car man in the transit system . He was a good man . I tried to do the same for Derek but he got into too many fights . Finally , there was a theft from one of the cashboxes . Derek protested his innocence and , truth to be told , we did n't want any scandal in these days . We let him go without prosecution . Derek 's been involved in petty crimes and with petty criminals ever since . " " I talked to Bobby Cannaro yesterday , " said Tom slowly . " He seemed actually scared of Derek . Bobby 's not the type to be scared of a cutpurse or a thief . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his seat . " There 's more . Most of the time , Derek 's just a charming rogue , a small-spirited man involved in small-spirited things . But sometimes , he 's .... Well , he 's not the same person . He becomes uncivilized . Barbaric . " Curley pulled at his cigar thoughtfully . " He becomes a man one would rather not deal with . A dangerous man . I 'm not surprised he found his way to Cannaro . I am surprised Cannaro is afraid of him . " " More than a bit , " Tom said dryly . Curley pursed his lips . " I think of Derek as the deeply disturbed son of a friend . Perhaps I was derelict in my duty in discharging him . Perhaps I should have had him sent to an institution . The workings of the city are my responsibility and by extension the welfare of those who are its employees is my responsibility as well . He seems to me to be a man ruled by both Sun and Moon . " Tom raised his eyebrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Tom apologetically . " I was speaking of him in larger symbolic terms . By the Moon 's light , Derek is a pleasant , shiftless soul . Sometimes overly aggressive . Sometimes lazy . But always a light too dim . Under the light of the Sun , he becomes strong and pitiless . Arrogant and powerful . " He pulled at his cigar . " As I said , I speak only in symbolic terms . I could have just as easily said he was ruled by Venus and Mars or under the sway of both angels and devils . " " An odd perception . " Curley waved his hand . " There are few frontiers left , Tom . Africa has come under control of Europe . Both poles have been discovered and reached . Man flies wherever he will . The only frontier left is that of the human mind . " He tapped the side of his head . " The German psychologists have shown us that . " " Where can I find him ? " " Ah , forgive me . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? He sometimes loiters in the Carman 's union hall . If your friend Maggie comes to see him she might find him there . There is also a tavern remarkably like this one on B Street in South Boston eponymously named the B Street Tavern . Although , as opposed to this unfortunate establishment , in that locale if you ask discreetly and preferably in a brogue you might get a pint of stout for your troubles . It is near the repair terminal . He has been seen there . Odd how all Irish taverns look alike , is n't it ? " Curley carefully put out his cigar and replaced it in his pocket . " Did you hear how back in the home country the wealthy Irish families imported English cooks to give their food more variety ? " " It 's a filthy lie . There are no wealthy Irish families . " Curley chuckled . " As you say . Good day , Tom . I wish you well . " With that , he left . THERE WAS NO ONE at the Carman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B Street . As he started down the stairs into the B Street Tavern he collided with a well-dressed young man exiting . Tom staggered back against the building and the young man sat down heavily at the bottom of the stairs . Tom straightened up and reached down to help the young man to his feet . " Just a minute , " he said as he recognized the young man . " You 're Curley 's secretary . I left a note with you this morning . " " Yes , sir . Daniel Itchwater . " " What are you doing here ? " The young man stammered and did not answer immediately . " Were you trying to warn Kenny I was coming ? " Tom shouted at him . Dan got hold of himself . " No , sir . I did n't know you were coming here at all . " " Why , then ? " Silently , Dan pulled a scrap of newsprint from his jacket and gave it to Tom . It was a clipping about a robbery happening early that morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the third had gotten away with " thousands of dollars . " It was typical of the Globe to be imprecise , thought Tom . The descriptions of the men were vague as well . Tom looked down at Dan with strong suspicion . " Derek ? " Dan nodded . " I think so . He 's my friend . I 've come to see him . " " Is he in there ? " Dan nodded again . " I saw him . He would n't tell me anything . " Tom pocketed the clipping . " I 'll keep this . Go on back to Curley 's office . Pretend you do n't know him . " Dan ran up the stairs and disappeared down the street . Tom entered the tavern . It took a moment for his eyes to adjust . He was n't sure he would know Derek by sight in this dim light . It turned out not to matter . Sitting next to him at a table in the back was Maggie . Maggie saw him instantly and tensed like a cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was morally certain it was not root beer . He crossed the room and pulled out a chair opposite them . " Can I join you ? " He sat down without waiting for a reply . Derek looked up at him sullenly . His eyes were red-rimmed and bloodshot , the space around them dark and hollow . His finely shaped nose had been broken and healed since Tom had seen him last . It now listed prominently to the left and had a pronounced swelling across the bridge . His cheekbones protruded and his cheeks had become hollow , giving him an underlit actor 's look . Derek was still dressed well but now the clothes hung loosely on him as if he 'd thinned down under a terrible weight . " Afternoon , Tom , " said Maggie in a low voice . Maggie , on the other hand , seemed to have properly filled out since she had left the house . Her face had gained the color that Derek 's lacked . Even though she barely showed , she wore the flushed excitement of pregnancy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Maggie , " he said in a similar voice . " You look well . " " I feel fine . " She sounded puzzled that this was so . " Derek , you do n't look so good . " Tom nodded toward the younger man . " Tom Kelley , " said Derek . Tom could tell from the sound of his voice that beer had been the weakest of his drinks for some time . " I did n't know you came into Boston . " " I spoke to your friend Dan when I came in . " Derek shook his head . " I do n't know anyone named Dan . " Tom ignored him . " He gave me this . " Tom put the clipping on the table . Derek did n't look at it . His gaze had fallen back to his drink . Tom felt a sudden contempt for this sodden drunk . No wonder he 'd bungled the robbery . How had Derek managed it at all ? Maybe he had n't . The description of the third man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then again , it might not . Maybe Tom had let himself be swayed by Dan 's belief that it had been Derek . Maggie glanced at the clipping . Her face changed from wariness to outrage . Tom prepared himself . No doubt she was going to turn on him for suspecting her man . Instead , she turned on Derek : " You told me it was off ! You promised ! You said you were through with the lot of them . " Derek looked at the clipping for the first time . " I am , are n't I ? They 're dead , are n't they ? " " Now that you 're a wanted man . " She pulled his face to hers . " I said I did n't want my baby 's father to be in jail . " Derek shook her off . " If it is my baby . " " It is . " " How do I know that ? How many customers did you have in four months ? " Derek turned to Tom . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Tom mildly . " Hell , " said Derek morosely . " It could be his kid . " " Not much chance of that , is there Tom ? " Maggie threw back her hair and glared at Tom . " None , " Tom agreed , wondering what she knew . " So what ? " said Derek . " It could be anybody 's . " " No , it could n't . " She leaned down to him . " I never did it with anybody for love but you . It 's your baby . I know . " Derek gave Tom a look as if to say : You see what I have to put up with . " Well , I did it for you . And him . " He nodded toward Maggie 's belly . " You 'll both be taken care of . " She slapped the top of his head . " And you 'll be in jail . Or dead . " She stood up and faced Tom . " If I came back , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom shook his head . " Of course not . " " A crying child 's not much good in a whorehouse , " she said , pushing him a little . Tom winced . He hated that word . " We 'll work something out . " Derek looked alert instantly . " You 're going back ? What about me ? " " You know what I told you . " She stepped around the table . " I said it was them or me . You chose them . " He clumsily tried to grab her but Tom pushed him back in his chair . As they started to step away , Tom gave a last wary glance back to Derek . A change - the change described by Curley and alluded to by Cannaro came over Derek 's face . Tom saw the face of a stumbling , unhappy drunk change and reflect something sly and ancient . Derek half grinned . He stood up and stepped gracefully around the table . He did not appear to move in any hurry but was suddenly there in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Derek said easily . Even his voice was different , a throaty purr instead of the nasal whine of a few moments ago . Tom backed away from him . Derek swung his leg upward gently in a graceful arc toward the side of Tom 's head . Surely , Tom thought , he was going to merely touch me to show what he can do , to count coup on me like the Indians in a graceful demonstration of power . In that long moment , Tom felt the demonstration might be all that was necessary , and he would leave this tavern , leave Boston and take the long train home , return to his house without Maggie . He might remember her fondly for a number of years and then , slowly and inevitably , forget her . Yes , he thought of saying , you 're right . She 's with you . The cracking pain , the vertigo of being thrown into the air , tumbling backward , the intimate embrace of broken wood , the instant of impact both infinitely brief and interminable that swallowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came as a complete surprise . First , he felt a hot bruise on the side of his face of an irregular size and shape , not clean and well defined . He thought it might be the shape of a boot . After that , he realized he was thinking these things and understood he 'd been unconscious . A man helped him from the floor to a chair  --  a waiter , perhaps ? Tom sat there for what seemed like hours . His shoulder hurt from the fall . He moved it , experimentally . There were sharp , inarticulate pains there but nothing felt broken . His ribs hurt when he breathed and his right eye would n't focus properly . That gave him the beginnings of a headache , which annoyed him . There was something sticky on his side - he reached around and felt rips in his shirt and jacket . Inside his shirt he felt blood and nearly threw up . Someone took his hand and moved it away . " Here , now , " came a voice still disconnected from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's anything serious . " Tom came to himself with a start and pulled away . The other people in the tavern had been staring at him . Now that he was awake , they turned away . Dan was sitting beside him . " I think you were badly cut when the chair broke under you . But I could n't see your ribs . It did n't seem as if your lungs were punctured . You seem to be able to breathe all right . Anything broken ? " Tom stood up and moved his arms and legs experimentally . " I feel like I 've been hit by a truck . Nothing 's broken . " He looked down at Dan . " You did n't go back to Curley 's office . " " Obviously . I wanted to see what happened . " " You got your wish . " Dan smiled ruefully . " So I did . " Prohibition had emasculated the bar but the waiter was still standing behind it , watching him . Tom went to the bar and pulled out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The waiter looked around and poured something out of sight . The glass placed in front of Tom was at least as clear and colorless as water . Tom sipped it and realized for the first time there were lacerations in his mouth as the alcohol burned them . After a moment , the pain subsided and the warm glow in his stomach remained . In a few minutes , the ache in his shoulder and side dimmed . Another fivedollar note persuaded the bartender to part with a towel and other items Tom used to make a rude bandage , and to dispatch a young boy , who magically materialized at a word , down the street with a new shirt . Once both bandage and shirt were in place , and Tom wore his jacket , the wounds were barely visible . " You should see a doctor , " Dan said quietly as he joined Tom at the bar . Tom ordered another drink . He nodded to Dan . " Where did he go ? " " I do n't know . " " He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's crazy . You could tell that . I 've known him all his life . it Tom nodded and leaned heavily against the bar . " I think I 'll go home . " " You ca n't do that ! " cried Dan . " Why not ? " " He beat you . Kicked you . Do n't you want to go after him ? " " Let 's see if I got this straight . " Tom sipped his drink , " This man is a robber . Possibly a killer . Certainly a man who can outfight me . He 's disappeared and left me somewhat worse for wear . " He turned to Dan . " Why do n't you go after him ? " " I will if you will . " Dan looked at him steadily . " Why do you want to find him ? " Dan stood up straight , no longer the callow youth but appearing to be a man of some substance . " Let 's say it is a matter of a debt . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " More the other way around . " Tom nodded . " Do you know where he is ? " " Maybe . " " Ah . " The silence lengthened . " There is the matter of the girl . " Tom sipped the whisky . Or was it-gin ? It tasted too bad to tell . " What matter ? " " Are n't you after the girl ? 11 " Am I ? " Dan fidgeted . " I listened while you and Mayor*Curley were discussing Derek . " " Ah . " Tom swirled the last of the gin - or was it vodka ? - and drained it . " Do you have a gun ? " Dan started at that . " A gun ? " " A simple question . Do you ? " Tom looked at him tiredly . " I 'm never going to let him get within kicking distance of me again . " " No . " Tom nodded . Dan was sitting close to his right . Tom reached for his glass as if he 'd forgotten he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all his strength . Dan fell back off his chair . Tom followed up the blow with a vicious kick to Dan 's groin . Dan doubled up and the breath came out of him in a faint shriek . Tom pulled open his coat and found the pistol he knew was there and a small glittering knife he did n't . " I must thank Derek for reminding me of my roots , " he said to Dan . " Tell me . Who are you ? Police trying to find Derek for the robbery ? One of the mayor 's bullyboys ? Or are you just trying to cash in on the money ? " Dan did n't answer . Instead , he vomited . " Kids . " He put the barrel of the pistol against Dan 's throat . " Where do you think he is ? " " Trolley , " Dan croaked . " A Street entrance to the underground . " " Thank you . " " Tell me , " said Dan as soon as he was able to breathe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . " Tom hid the pistol in his jacket pocket and left the tavern . " A " Street was near the new Edison plant built not ten years before . A trolley , all sparks and thunder , roared out of the underground and turned down the street when he reached the corner . As he stood there , cold and feeling broken , his own blood marking him , he felt suddenly old . He had avoided violence since he was thirty . He dealt with the satisfaction of men 's other appetites . What was he doing here ? Then , he imagined Maggie 's look of fear and confusion as Derek dragged her out of the tavern . It reminded him of Elisabeth 's face when he told her Maggie had left the house . Funny , he thought , Elisabeth would be afraid for her when she left and not when she was there . He could n't face Elisabeth if he did n't go in after Derek . He would know that even if he never saw Elisabeth again . Sighing , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first thing he noticed was how warm it was , warm like the fetid mud of a swamp , steaming like a stream of urine sprayed against a building on a cold day . He loosened his coat and checked the pistol again . The second thing he noticed was the dampness . The walls were beaded as if sweating and the tracks were red in the dim light and slick . Overhead lines powered the trolleys . He was grateful there was no third rail here to make a single arcing flash of him . It was not as dark as he imagined . At regular intervals appeared an incandescent lamp in a niche in the wall , a votive candle to Edison 's electric god . In the distance , he could hear the scraping of steel , the scream of animals in passion followed by the distant thunder of their copulation . He saw a light turn down the tunnels toward him and he stepped into one of the niches in the wall . A trolley wailed around the corner , spat lightning and bounded up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windows and saw not a blur but a series of perfectly etched still pictures of monstrous faces , of disconnected mouths and noses and sexual organs conjoined by an impression of wild laughter . Then , it was gone and only the distant groans and shrieks remained . Tom found he was shaking . He felt of the pistol and it calmed him . The things a man 's mind might present to him . It came to him that there must be miles of these tunnels beneath Boston . A man could be lost here for years , living on the water dripping from the filthy streets and a cuisine of rats . It 's madness to be down here . Madness to think I can follow him - Derek had been a car man for some time . He must know his way around . Tom found the pistol in his hand . Madness . He continued to follow downward tracks . In the thick , dank air he felt disoriented . He had no inkling of time . The hypothetical man he 'd considered before must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here all of his life , in a dark chaos shot through with random bestial roars , his way laid out before him and his only choice the scrabbling to a shallow well of safety or standing in place to be struck down and destroyed . He saw the honest light of a lantern and made for it . Deep in a square block supporting a vaulted ceiling he found a room . In it , sitting on a tall stool , and working a broad bank of switches , levers , and dials , was an old man with the most incredibly gnarled and crippled-looking hands Tom had ever seen . The hands looked as if they had been stepped on and twisted and then healed in place . They seemed to have no effect on the old man 's ability and he quickly flicked the metal switches with a sharp snap and pulled the long Bakelite levers smoothly to rest . The knobs of the dials were knurled in swirls and patterns and each meter was individually lit , the hair-thin indicators twitching like dancing knives . Next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dust shaken from the walls . The dog regarded him with red , rheumy eyes . The old man seemed unsurprised when Tom stumbled in . He nodded toward a chair as he went on working . The room was at a crossroads of tracks and every few seconds the earth and walls would shake as a trolley rumbled past . The dog seemed to view Tom with contempt . He stood slowly on ancient , arthritic limbs and went to the door . Two trolleys went past , shaking Tom in his chair and sparking the air with dust . The dog ignored the noise . After the trolleys passed , he stepped outside and urinated against a pillar . Then he came back inside and returned to his station next to the stool . The dog continued to stare at Tom . The passing of the trolleys seemed to mark a resting place in the old man 's activities and he turned toward Tom , interlaced his two arthritic hands and cracked his knuckles , snapping them like the switches . The dog growled . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Tom 's sudden concern . " He hates it when I do that . Pisses him off for some reason . But he 's got no interest in eating strangers . " " I 'm looking for someone - " " I bet you are , with your gun and all . " " I have n't got - " " Hell you have n't ! I can see it half falling out of your coat . Having any trouble finding them ? " " Well - " " Hell , anybody would . If I sold my soul and did n't want the devil to come find me , I 'd hide right here . He 'd walk right by . You the law ? " " No - " " Cannaro 's boys , maybe ? He 's lost a good many people down here . " " Not - " " Did Curley lose somebody down here , f'Chrissake ? I thought he took better care of his people than that . " Tom stopped talking and waited . The old man fell silent , still grinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man leaned forward , ready to interrupt him . Tom stopped again . The old man leaned back . This went on for four or five minutes until the old man burst out laughing . " Go on . I wo n't stop you , " he said , wiping his eyes . " I 'm Armstrong DeLuxe . " He stuck out his hand . " Sure you are , " said Tom and took it . He had to grip hard just to keep his hand from being crushed . " No , really . Parents came from Quebec . I do n't get much company down here . " I wonder why , thought Tom . " Tom Kelley . I 'm looking for Derek Kenny . He came down here . With a woman . " The old man looked interested . " You 're looking for Derek . You know anything about him ? " Tom shrugged . " A lot of people are scared of him . He decked me . I 'm not really interested in him . I 'm looking for the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wife ? " " No - " " Lover , then ? " Tom stopped and stared at him . Armstrong laughed . " It 's irritating but I enjoy it . What the hell else would I do down here but torture visitors , pet my dog , and work ? Do n't begrudge me my fun . We all do what we must to occupy ourselves until quitting time . " " Have you seen him ? " Tom said tiredly . Armstrong shook his head vigorously . " Not a bit . But that 's nothing . There are a thousand paths in these tunnels and only a few of them pass by here . Came down here with a woman , did he ? A pretty one , too , I 'll bet . And he did n't bring her by to meet me - I 'll have to remember to kill the son-of-a-bitch for that the next time I see him . If I do . " He looked pointedly at the gun in Tom 's pocket . " I do n't wish Derek dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They kill them with guns and other things . Nobody ever got killed by wishing . " " Yeah . " Tom had had about enough of this . " Thanks . " He stood up and started for the door . The dog rose up and stood in the doorway , staring up at him with red eyes . " Hey , there , " said Armstrong behind him . " I did n't say I would n't help you . Give me a chance . " " You said you had n't seen him . " " Oh , I do n't need to see him , " he said expansively . " I know where he 'll be . There 's only one place you can take a girl down here . That 's the Mechanics " Club . " Tom was so tired he wanted to weep . " Where 's that ? " " Down deep , Mister Kelley , " Armstrong said softly . " Way down deep . You got to be sure you want to go all the way before you 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and friend better be worth it . " " She 's not any of those . My employee , maybe . " " Then you got to be doubly sure you want to go there . " Tom looked down at his feet . " Yeah . " Armstrong reached out and took Tom 's shoulder in a friendly way . " No one 's making you . It 's a long way down . You do n't have to go , friend . " Tom looked at the old man . He felt like he was carrying stones . It would be nice to set them down . He remembered Maggie 's face . And Elisabeth 's . " Yes . Yes , I do . " " Would she do the same for you ? " Tom shrugged , thinking of the day Maggie came to his house . " Maybe she already did . " He straightened his shoulders . " How do I find the Mechanics " Club ? " Armstrong got down from the stool and rummaged in the back , out of sight for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp . The lenses were thick and prismatic and it looked heavy . He raised the lenses and lit the lamp and it sputtered for a moment as he carefully trimmed and adjusted the wick , suddenly looking as fussy and precise as an old schoolteacher . Finally , he lowered the lenses and the room was filled with a lambent , pearly glow . " I know something about the production of light , " he said with a satisfied note in his voice . " My partner , " said Armstrong , indicating the hound , " will take you to the tunnels that start toward the Club . They 've been abandoned since before the war . No lights down that way . After that , you 're on your own . Just keep going down . " " Why are you helping me ? " Armstrong laughed . " Nobody 's a secondary character in their own story . I got my reasons same as you . They 're just none of your business . " The dog snorted and stepped outside . He stopped in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the distance came the faint wail of an oncoming trolley . Tom got the strange feeling the dog would wait for him until the trolley came and tore him into little pieces . An image came to him of the dog reassembling itself from its grisly parts and , the look of contempt still on its face , returning to its station next to Armstrong . Tom , in turn , looked back toward Armstrong but the old man had resumed his work , flicking switches , drawing levers , turning dials . The dog led him across the tracks as the trolley lights began to brighten the haze . They entered a narrow side tunnel , barely wide enough for the older , smaller cars , as the lights swept over them . The grade downward steepened perceptibly and the two of them began to descend . THIS TUNNEL WAS clearly different from the ones he had walked through before . The tracks were of a narrower gauge and pitted with rust . The building material itself looked older , more like stone or ancient concrete . White-patched and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been more at home lining a mausoleum or a long stretch of catacombs . It was damper here , and hotter . Water , beading on the walls or dripping from the walls or ceiling , had been a fixture above . Here , the nature of it was different . The walls varied between being slicked with a viscous slime or completely dry . Water did not bead on the walls at all but broke through in streams . The pale light of the lantern made them glitter . The water had eaten through the tracks in places , making the rusted remains sharp as razors . More than once , he and the dog were forced to ford a stream . One was three feet deep as it tore out of a new riverbed and crossed the tunnel rippingly fast . Beneath the gray waters he could hear the groan and tumble of moving rocks . That one nearly took him with it ; a rolling boulder smashed into his ankle . He had a bad moment when the lantern slipped from his hand . The dog caught it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even then , he had to bathe his ankle in the icy water to keep it from swelling . For a while he was afraid he 'd broken it . But it was only a purple bruise . Most of these streams crossed the tunnel . One incorporated the trolley bed itself in its channel and they waded some miles as they made their way . Eventually , that river also left the tunnel and the path grew dry and the tracks reappeared . The dog accompanied him for hours , staying slightly ahead of Tom . Gradually , the tunnel grew straight and unbroken until Tom realized that the tunnel and the tracks had been straight for some time . He looked around and saw that he was alone . The dog , so silent and dark , had just slipped away . Or , he thought , more likely it had just sat and waited for him to pass and then returned to Armstrong . Tom wondered how the dog would find his way back in the dark without the lantern . He had a feeling the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other sounds of the tunnel asserted themselves : the regular skittering of vermin , a few lone frogs in the darkness , and a constant whispering as if something was trying to make itself understood but could n't , and therefore could n't rest comfortably . The sounds and the solitude dulled him until he forgot everything except the heavy tread of his shoes and the weight of the lantern . " Why are you here ? " came a whisper . He did not start . The words came so naturally out of the sounds around him he might have expected it . " Who are you ? " he called . There was no answer . He might have been talking to himself and he might have been answering . " Why are you here ? " came the whisper again . " I 'm looking for Maggie . " " Who 's Maggie ? " " Someone who might have been my daughter . " More unintelligible whispering . " Why is n't she ? " " Because I ca n't havea daughter . " He paused for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single person he was talking to ; instead , it was the tunnel itself , the tendrils of the city grown down dark and deep here . He was crawling and stumbling between the roots of a tree of great substance . Tom did not feel he could dissemble or hide from such a thing . " I lack the power . " The whispering became unintelligible again . The lantern showed blockage of the tunnel ahead of him . As he neared it , the obstruction resolved itself into an old trolley . The style reminded Tom of his own youth . These sharp-edged , baroque-styled trolleys looked like nothing more than a gazebo , stretched to fit the tunnel but still retaining a gazebo 's original edges and grillwork . The trolley fit the tunnel tightly . There was no room on either side of it . The windshield in the front was still intact . He climbed the coupling and brushed the dust from the window and held up the lantern . Inside , the trolley was empty . He could not see to the trolley 's other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loose piece of stone . It was heavy , perhaps three or four pounds . He carried it back and shattered the glass . Thick shards flew about him . In blind panic , he held up the lantern to deflect a piece flying toward his eye . After a moment , all was silent again . " Careful of the glass , " came a whisper . " Thanks , " he said dryly . He crawled through the opening , careful of the glass still in the frame . Inside , the seats and railings were just as he 'd remembered when he was a kid . For a moment , he thought that this was in fact the trolley that had run down the heart of Brookline when he was a child , smelling of ozone and hot steel . Beacon Street ran all the way downhill from Summit Avenue where he 'd grown up . You could see the trolley come for nearly a mile , a knot of people waiting at each stop . Clothed in different colors , each with his own life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were like patches in the same quilt , undulating and covering the street as far as he could see . Tom was not a man given to flights of imagination , but in the pearl light of the lantern , he fancied he could see people he had known sitting in the trolley 's seats . Giapetto , the Italian kid across Beacon , who insisted on being called George . Martin , the Jewish kid , who had to come out with them on the sly so his parents did n't find out . And , Fariz , the boy from Syria . He had been older than the rest of them . Fariz , who was dead . Next to Fariz was himself . Christ , had he ever been so young ? Was n't he an altar boy then ? Not that it had made much difference . He 'd brought them all along with him . Giapetto had shown them the way . Martin had figured out how to do it . Fariz had the muscle and Tom the will . Let 's see . Giapetto was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had disappeared afterward . Tom had run to Hopkinton and Fariz had ended up in the morgue . Not bad for the night 's work of four young men . Tom shook his head . That was thirty years past , almost . Who knew where they might be now ? His eyes stung and he wiped them . He moved to the back of the trolley . The tunnel widened here slightly , connecting with a natural cavern . He forced the rear door open and stepped down easily . The tracks continued , the spikes pounded into solid rock . The cavern opened out , tall and broad . Great stalagmites and stalactites welded the base and roof of the cavern together with pillars of flowing quartz . The cavern clearly showed the marks of flowing water . Now , dust stirred as Tom walked and the air was dry and hot . He could hear a distant pounding of machinery , or war , or music . The tracks led on until the cavern narrowed again and then led to a broad , oaken double door , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a trolley . The pounding was muffled music and clearly came from behind the door . Tom pushed at the door . Initially it resisted but gradually , silently , as if oiled , the door swung inward . He passed inside . Here cobblestones braced the track and the corridor was lined with brick . The passageway was short and where the tracks stopped , the cavern opened out in a large room filled with people . Along one edge of the room was a dark crevasse whose depth was hidden in shadow . On the other , a long bar made of ivory which had obviously never acceded to Prohibition . Between the crevasse and the bar were tables and chairs . The pounding was a band playing drums and bagpipes - Irish pipes , he saw - rendering a chaotic version of " Sweet Adeline . " The drums had been made of great wine casks and threatened to drown out even the bagpipes . The people were mostly men wearing mechanics " coveralls , dirty and covered with the stains of oil and coal . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club . The few women had the look of well-paid prostitutes . The room smelled of oil and coal , hot steel cut with fire . No one noticed him and he dimmed the lantern and made his way to the bar . He could not see Derek in the press . The crowd was populated with edgy and dangerous men , men who had come here after a day of pounding iron and handling fire , burning their skin and singeing their hair . All had scars of one sort or another . The man standing to one side of Tom had one hand horribly burned and the man on the other had lost an eye . Neither man seemed particularly debilitated but downed their drinks in a murderous silence . The barkeep delivered a shot glass of amber fluid without being asked and left without asking for pay . Tom figured in a place like this there would be many ways to pay . He drained the glass in one gulp and then held onto the bar for a full minute to get his breath back . Thus fortified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm looking for Derek Kenny . And a woman . " The man grunted and did n't answer . Tom turned and repeated his question to the man with the burned hand . He did n't answer immediately . " You her father ? " he asked quietly . It was Tom 's turn to take his time answering . " Maybe , " he said finally . The man nodded . " Took her virtue and all that , eh ? " " Just tell me where to find him . " " You ca n't see him ? Look over by the end of the tracks . " Tom slowly turned and looked in the indicated direction . For a moment , the people all blurred together and he could n't see individual faces , only the colors of clothes , the geometric shapes of the chairs and tables , the blurred masks of faces . Then , emerging , taking on outline and form , a transition of state like steel being drawn from stone or flame blossoming from gasoline , came a face he knew : Maggie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wholly focused on Derek sitting next to her . Tom watched her face . He could not see any influence from her father 's side of the family , but it was obvious Elisabeth 's face had served as a foundation for Maggie 's own . Tom could see the same curve of the jaw . The straight line of her mouth so apparently set and then so fluid as she laughed or smiled . Her eyes came directly from Elisabeth without any intervening genetic dilution and showed only her mother 's deep ocean blue . Maggie was smiling , a deep loving smile , toward Derek . Her eyes were vacant . Derek was playing cards , his hands a blur . He was grinning . With a start , Tom realized that Derek was grinning at him . Maggie might not have noticed Tom but Derek was not so oblivious . The meaning of his expression was crystal clear : Kill me if you can or I 'll consume her completely . Tom stood slowly and tiredly . There was no help for it , then . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowds parted from them . Derek calmly folded his hand and moved his chair back , rose . Tom reached for his gun and pulled it out . He pointed it at Derek . Maggie 's gaze turned to Tom and her eyes grew wide and excited . Tom pointed the gun at Derek and pulled the trigger . The gun felt jammed or his finger paralyzed . He could n't pull the damned trigger . Derek continued grinning . He stepped to Tom as Tom futilely pulled at the intransigent trigger . Derek pushed away the gun . Tom said : " I do n't want to die . " Derek chuckled and slapped Tom across the face , breaking his neck . A lightning bolt of pain crackled from the base of Tom 's skull all the way down his back and was swallowed up in a silent void and suddenly Tom could no longer feel his legs . Derek picked Tom up over his head and threw him high in the air . Tom struck the side of the cavern and fell twenty feet into the crevasse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dark , he could feel a numb weakness come over him . He was going to die . And why not ? And why should n't he ? Had n't he left Elisabeth ? Had n't he killed Fariz ? When Fariz shot him and he had shot Fariz simultaneously and he had woken up after days of hot pain to discover himself castrated , had n't he wanted to die ? Had n't he felt he deserved to die ? " Not yet , " came a whisper from the stones around him . " Who are you ? " he said thickly . He felt a cold hand touching him . " You 've met me before . " Tom looked up and saw a face formed from differing shades of shadow . It seemed familiar . " Dan , " he said , knowing it was true . " Dan Itchwater , " he repeated . " Yes . " There was more to the face than he 'd seen before , a beard . Glasses . " And Armstrong . " " Yes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Death had receded for a moment . " Your friend . Your partner . I told you , I have my own agenda . " " Why ? " He thought for a moment . " Derek ? Who is he ? " " He could be aman who made a deal . A standard deal for the adoration by women and bodily power . You know the terms . Say , then , when the terms of the contract are due , he might flee to a place where the contract is superseded by an older , stronger agreement . Or , he could be a man possessed by something greater than himself , a demon or madness . Or , he could be a man who is burning the fire of his entire life in one roaring pyre and not expecting to live much longer . " Tom did n't speak for a moment . " What do you want with me ? " " This is an opportunity , Tom , " came the voice . " Remember what you said to Jake : You would brave hellfire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You bring your life along with you , Tom . I can read it . " " They were words , " he said bitterly . " You can make them more than words . " Tom looked up into the indistinct shadows . " You want me to sell you my soul ? " " Why would I want that ? " " You said Derek had sold his soul . " " I said he might have . " " And you want me to kill him for you , right ? Well , then tell me the truth . " There was a pause . " The truth is you 're a man who murdered his best friend in a fit of greed and excitement and took the profits to start a whorehouse . If there is a Hell and I 'm the devil , I have controlling interest in your soul right now . The truth is you 've failed miserably trying to get Maggie away from a man who will almost certainly kill her before he 's through . The truth is , your neck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your left kidney and bladder are ruptured and the sharp point of one of your broken ribs has sliced your pancreas . You 're bleeding to death on the inside . The only reason you do n't feel the pain is that your spinal cord has been severed and the wee sparks that carry messages of pain ca n't make their delivery . The truth is , you 're dying and soon to be dead , and in the face of that you have an opportunity . " " What do you want ? " " How far will you go ? Do you want to die here ? Or do you want to live ? Do you want to save Maggie or do you want to see her waste away as Derek consumes her ? What is she worth to you , Tom ? What is your own life worth to you ? " " What 'll it cost me ? " " That 's up to you . " " What ? You 'll give me my life back ? " He snorted weakly . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a gift , Tom . Sometimes the cost is known . Sometimes it is n't . Some people do n't live long enough to pay it back and never know the cost . Some learn instantly . " " I 'm not scared of dying anymore , " he said to the voice . The voice did not reply . After a long time , Tom said : " But I want to live . I want Maggie to live . I 'll pay what it costs . " He felt cold hands straighten his spine and set his head properly on his neck . He shrieked with the pain . He felt hands take his broken ribs and weld them together , felt them draw closed the broken and leaking blood vessels and organs inside him , felt them straighten his crooked leg . After a long , interminable period where there was no distinguishable perception but pain , no sense but agony , he came to himself on all fours , puking and crying . Tom wiped his eyes and his mouth and looked around . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun was on the ground near him . He picked it up . He climbed out of the crevasse onto the bricks and leaned against the wall . After a moment to steady himself , he pushed himself erect and again looked around the room . Derek had returned to his chair . Maggie was seated near him but turned away . She was crying . Over him ? Tom wondered . He hoped so . Tom threaded his way back toward Derek . Derek saw him and looked confused for a moment , then grinned . Again , he stood up and walked toward Tom . Again , Tom lifted the gun . For a moment , the trigger jammed again . What the hell , thought Tom . He can only kill me . The trigger released and the gun roared and Derek 's face disappeared in an explosion of red and gray . Derek 's body kept walking for a moment . Tom fired again , walking toward him . He fired into Derek 's head , his chest , his belly . He kept firing into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired until the gun was empty . Then , he dropped the gun on the body and stepped over him to Maggie . " Let 's go home " She did n't answer but nodded . He held her hands and looked back to the crowd . He saw Dan watching . " Go on deeper in the cave . That 's the way home , " said Dan , and gave him the lantern . Tom led Maggie , unresisting , deeper in the cave . The way was straight and unbranched , like a tunnel . After a while , it began to ascend and Tom could feel fresh air . There were ruins of old structures pinned to the wall with spikes and lathered with concrete : old mining platforms , the shelves of root cellars , the layered bunks of an old bed . The cave narrowed to just a couple of feet across . They turned beneath a more recent stairway and came out from under it into the basement of Tom 's house . The floor was wet and Tom could hear the cracking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their eyes as they regarded him from the flooded corners . Tom looked back and saw nothing but the other side of the basement . At that point , by mutual silent consent , they went up the stairs , through the house to the front porch . It must have either been Sunday or near dawn , since there was no activity in the house and no one about . Tom had no idea what day it was . The moon was full and the light clear . Maggie started weeping . She did n't say a word but buried her head on his shoulder . For a long time , he and Maggie sat in the cool light of the moon . He was afraid of what she might say . He had , after all , killed her lover and the father of her child right in front of her . " Are you my father ? " she said at last . " Do you want me to be ? " " Yes . " He looked at her . " Why ? " " Because my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't love her . " " Do you love him ? " " No . He never loved me , either . I always figured it was because I was your child . " Not sure how to proceed , he stroked her hair . " Why did you want to sleep with me ? " " I did n't . " " Come again ? " " I wanted to be loved by you . Like the way I thought you loved Mama . Like the way you might love me if I was your daughter . " She looked up at him . " If I had to sleep with you for it to happen , that was all right with me . " Tom let her go so he could see her . " When I was twenty , me and three friends robbed the State Street Bank . We got away with it and hid out in a Quincy basement . We hid there for a month and went nearly crazy with fear and boredom . I got into a fight with my best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he - well , there was n't much left of me down there . Enough to make a showing but not enough to make it count . " He took her shoulders and stared straight at her . " Honey , if me and Elisabeth could have made you , we would , whatever Pete Bowker said . But we could n't . So I left and started up the house . " " Then you are n't my father . " Tom did n't say anything for a minute . He lifted her blouse put his hand on her round belly and caressed it . She started and stiffened in surprise . Strange , he thought , in other circumstances he could touch a woman here and it would be a prelude to things occurring further down . But here , now , he did n't feel that way at all . " When I was twenty I thought I could n't be hurt . The robbery put paid to that idea . Then I thought I 'd never grow old . But I figured that one out eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed me the error of my ways tonight , and I accepted it . I 'm not afraid of it anymore . " He moved his hand over the roundness of her belly , feeling the pulsing warmth of it . " You know ? This makes dying seem not so bad . " He pulled his hand away , lifted his gaze and looked deep in her eyes . " I 'll be any kind of father you need . If you want me . " She broke off looking at him and cried again . Then , with a small laugh , she said , " If the kid ca n't have a father , he ought to at least have a grandfather . " They held each other until daylight . At first light he considered where he was . Two miles east and he would be at Jake 's tree . A mile west and he would be at the lake . Boston , and everything about it , seemed half a world away . This house and the two of them were the center of everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I finished . He looked up at me , his eyes red and rheumy with years of dissipation , cigarette smoke , and waiting . He nodded to himself and then looked again to the ground . We must have sat there for ten minutes or so . I watched him closely . At one point - to the crackling sound of a tree freezing or the neighbor 's cat creeping through the woods - I looked away . When I looked back , he was gone . There was a small pile of cigarette butts on the ground next to where he had been sitting . I sat a bit longer . It was long before dawn . The sky was as clear as if it had been etched into a great glass bowl . I could pick out Orion and the Pleiades . It was a winter sky , but soon , Ursa Major would replace Orion in prominence and summer would be here . My son would be a summer baby , born under the warmth of the bear . Benjamin was born in June . Mother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of success in these things . I never saw Tom again , though I occasionally find an anonymous cigarette butt or a footprint in the woods near the house . Anybody could have left them . The rest of Tom 's life was relatively uneventful . Maggie stayed in the house until her daughter , named Veronique after the woman Ethel , was born . Mother and child were healthy . She then moved back in with her mother . There was a little scandal over this but it died down after the crash of 1929 put it in perspective . The Depression began and Prohibition ended . Elisabeth Bowker died and Maggie reopened the rooming house . Tom 's house continued to operate for a few years more until Tom was killed under mysterious circumstances . He was apparently shot during an argument . Some say the argument was over a woman , though I find this unconvincing . Others say the Boston crime families killed him to take over the house . One man from Ashland told me that according to his father , the man who had killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been drunk and argued which of them was on the more intimate terms with the devil . Tom was convinced that this was one subject where he was truly knowledgeable but the argument got out of hand . Tom was not mourned by anyone in Hopkinton except Maggie . He had been vilified too many times for that . His will left Maggie everything he had , which turned out to be considerable wealth . She settled things with the girls , sold the house to the Burtts , and took her daughter out west to Illinois . The Burtts sold the house to the Smiths . The Smiths sold it to us . I heard once from a minister that one 's duties were to choose good , expose evil , and bear witness . I do n't know why Tom Kelley visited me in the final months before the birth of my son . Still , I can easily see why a ghost might haunt the living . They need something from us . It could be just a kind word , revenge , or to be reassured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their children or their home survived . It is we , the living , who are limited in what we can do for the dead . We can only tell our own versions of their stories , broken and twisted as they are , back to them , to show them who they were , where they were , and what they did . To remind them that though they are no longer living we still come from them and therefore they can never be truly dead . We must choose the good we can , expose the evil we know , and , ultimately , bear witness .
