It was 1989 , and I was taking the crisp morning air in St. Moritz , high in the Swiss Alps , preparing for another day of arduous sportswriting labor  --  the World Bobsleigh Championships , I believe . Let 's see : start with a hot chocolate , a brisk ski across the lake , maybe lunch at the Palace and then ... <P> Grrrrraaaack ! A horrible grinding sound came from the woods . I turned and saw an asylum escapee hurtling down an icy chute , face first , on what appeared to be a cafeteria tray . He was , in fact , a member of the village " toboggan " club , out for a ride on his " skeleton " sled . Three quick thoughts emerged : it 's a bit early in the day for that , he 's loonier than a luger , and we 'll not see skeleton in the Olympics anytime soon . <P> Well , it 's a new millennium , and no doubt feeling heat from the X-Games generation , the International Olympic Committee has indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third ya-gotta-be-nuts sliding sport ( along with bobsled and luge ) now on the schedule , the slate of what Americans consider the Peripherals  --  nonmarquee sports that zoom into the sporting Zeitgeist every fourth year only to melt away in the post-Games thaw  --  is at an all-time high . At Salt Lake we 'll have all kinds of sleds , cross-country races ( some with guns ! ) , ski jumps and ski-jump hybrids . In the past , these events have given us Jamaican bobsledders , hyperdrugged European ski champs and Eddie the Eagle , Great Britain 's wonderfully woebegone ski jumper who had all of Calgary ducking for cover in 1988 . The U.S. has won about a medal and a half in the Ps . <P> This year Americans will do well in the Peripherals , so maybe we will pay more attention , and we ought to : they are among the great glories of the Games . Figure skaters ? Synchronized swimmers on a frozen pool . Freestyle skiers ? Hip-hop show-offs . Snowboarders are worse . But the Ps ? Elemental . Pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Cornish who decided to take the St. Moritz track headfirst during the 1887 tobogganing Grand National . So not only is skeleton not new , it is downright hallowed and has been in the Olympics before , most recently in 1948 . <P> The skeletals insist , against the evidence , that they are not mad . " When all of a sudden you 're on a 10-ft. wall and you 've got four G-forces pushing you into the sled , that 's cool , " says Utahan Lincoln DeWitt , 34 . He was first in the World Cup rankings last year , but has slid a bit this year . He certainly has a shot at winning , as does teammate Jim Shea Jr. , 33 , of Lake Placid , N.Y . <P> Jimmy Shea 's was one of the feel-good stories in the run-up to the Games and is now one of the most poignant . His grandfather Jack was the oldest living U.S. Olympic gold medalist at 91 , having won twice in speed skating at the 1932 Games . Jimmy 's father Jim Sr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by cross-country skiing  --  in the 1964 Olympics . Both men were to be in the stadium when Jimmy marched in , but Jack was killed in a car accident two weeks ago . Jimmy will slide with his grandfather 's funeral card taped to his helmet .
