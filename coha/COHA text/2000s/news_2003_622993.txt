<p> Mary Thompson 's voice is , in so many ways , her meal ticket . At once professional yet friendly , it is a voice designed to lead hungry would-be diners to tables at San Francisco 's Bacar restaurant - and leave them happy with the time and date they 've " chosen . " <p> In a country where everyone seems to be hungry at the same time , only a few can be satisfied . Thompson helps the rest of us be comfortable with our lot - whether it 's chowing down as the first wave of commuters hits the freeways , eating at the bar , or even delaying a birthday dinner until 10:45 p.m . <p> What consumers often perceive as annoyances , or , what David O'Malley of Bacar calls , " playing games , " may in fact be crucial strategies for survival . Restaurateurs say that things such as offering tables at 5:30 or 9:30 p.m. , tweaking reservation times by 15 minutes , and letting tables sit empty while diners are waiting are necessary to keep business running smoothly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is take care of people , " says Clark Wolf , a restaurant consultant in the Bay Area and New York , " and take care of enough people to pay the rent . " <p> To do both , and do them well , makes for happy , satisfied diners . <p> Talk to Kathy King , general manager at Boulevard in San Francisco , about why people want to eat at 7 p.m. , and she 'll quickly point out that most diners are flexible . <p> " They 'll ( all want to ) come between 7:30 and 8 , " she wisecracks . <p> That 's fine if a restaurant plans for one seating , but " if you do one seating , like the French , you have to charge like they do , " Wolf notes . <p> Better , restaurateurs say , to have people coming all night long in a smooth , steady stream . It 's called turning tables , and it can mean the difference between success and failure . <p> " I have my fixed costs here every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in San Francisco . " If I make only one turn , I 'm losing money . If I want to stay in business I have to figure out how to do two turns in one night . " <p> Each restaurant has its own break-even point . At Cafe Kati , profitability came through a combination of multiple turns and squeezing in 10 more seats . The restaurant has been running for 13 years . <p> Still , turning tables often leaves diners feeling crazed . With restaurants considered less of a business and more of a public service , customers often believe they should be able to dine whenever they want and for as long as they like . <p> " They want everything right now and they want it perfect , " says Jonathan Arbel , assistant general manager at San Francisco 's Betelnut . " They 'll wait 20 minutes for a table , with no reservation , and it 's the end of the world . They go to the doctor 's and wait an hour and the doctor does n't give them a free dessert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes some of this is a result of competition and an abundance of dining choices , and partially due to the perception that complaining in a restaurant will usually get you something free . <p> Wolf , however , offers a loftier reason . <p> " We want the meal to be magical , " he says . " We want to come in at the moment we think is the peak of the evening . " <p> When that peak is reached varies from city to city , neighborhood to neighborhood , even restaurant to restaurant . <p> " San Francisco used to be a later town ; now it 's not , " says Wolf . " The middle of the evening is when they want to eat , and they want larger tables with more generations sitting around it than 10 years ago . And that 's going to be a slower table . " <p> Statistics from OpenTable.com , the San Francisco-based online reservation system , points to the same trend . The most popular day and time to dine out for OpenTable users in January was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p.m . Next in order was Friday and Saturday at 7 p.m . Of the top 10 times , all fell between 6 and 8:30 p.m. on Friday or Saturday . <p> The problem with reservations at 7 , 7:30 or 8 is that these times fall in the middle of the night , and can prevent the restaurant from turning the table . Many restaurants wo n't reserve those times unless it 's for a VIP . <p> Most restaurateurs try to organize themselves to avoid this problem while still meeting the particular demands of their clientele . They will block off a table for a certain number of hours depending on the size of the party , the style of restaurant , and past experience on how long people in that city or town eat . Generally , the higher- end restaurants allow more time per table . <p> CAREFUL TIMING <p> At Bacar , Thompson allocates two hours for a table for two . A party of four gets a little more time . For a party of six or eight , it 's three hours . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather be safe than sorry . <p> " I do n't want to risk having people show up and that table is still filled , " she says . <p> Cafe Kati follows a similar timing system . Webber and his staff juggle clients to achieve two turns a night while trying to keep people happy . Sometimes he has to play into the foibles of human nature . A 9 p.m. table wo n't sell , but a table at 8:45 will . To ensure this , he tries to nudge diners wanting a 7 p.m. table back to 6:45 . <p> Fifteen minutes may not seem like much but it can make or break that sought-after turn . <p> Turning a table is as much art as it is science . It takes the reservationist , the general manager , the wait staff and Lady Luck to make it work . A snarl-up on the Bay Bridge can blow away the best-laid plans of maitre d 's across the city . <p> " It 's like a game , " O'Malley says . " The way I try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door is like playing chess on three different levels . You 're like Mr. Spock . You anticipate a plan , plan it out , then have a fall-back , a third level , if the whole night falls apart . If you look at it in only one way you 're going to get caught . " <p> Restaurateurs like Charles Phan of San Francisco 's Slanted Door talk about the " ripple " ' effect . A party is 10 to 15 minutes late for their reservation , so they back up onto the group that 's supposed to have the table next , and so on . The key , he says , is to leave wriggle room . <p> EMPTY TABLES CAN BE GOOD <p> That 's why what may look like inexplicably empty tables to hungry customers is actually a restaurant trying to anticipate what 's going to happen next , O'Malley says . <p> At Betelnut , half the tables are set aside for reservations and the other half for walk-ins . Arbel says the wait for walk-ins can be up to two hours on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time " for the wait , Arbel says a staffer will seek out the party , thank them for waiting and perhaps offer a complimentary drink or an appetizer . <p> " We try to take care of them , " he says . <p> Restaurants also value walk-ins to fill up chinks in their seating plans . <p> " We push walk-ins , " says Boulevard 's King . " It helps with people who do n't show and who do n't bother to call . " <p> As for diners who show up late , at one point restaurants would have chastised them for their tardiness , King recalls . But in today 's faltering economy , no one can afford to do that . <p> " Now , it 's , ' Great that you 're here , have a drink , ' and we 'll get them settled . The business has changed , " she says . <p> The economy , in fact , is making it easier for diners in several ways . Prices are low , reservations are easier to make , restaurants are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story Tom Billings of Alameda tells of calling his favorite restaurant , Pasta Pelican in Alameda , at 6 p.m. and asking if he and 13 others could come in at 7 p.m . The answer ? " No problem , " he says . <p> " When we arrived , the place was packed to the rafters but there , in a prime view location , our table for 14 awaited us , " Billings recalls . " How did he do it ? I did n't ask and he did n't tell . " <p> Conversely , Edward K. Lortz of San Francisco still remembers calling a new restaurant back in the 1980s and asking for a reservation . <p> " When I asked for any time , the most pretentious voice explained that there was nothing for six weeks , " he says . " I asked for the seventh week , and pretentious voice said they only make reservations six weeks in advance . " <p> If , as Clark Wolf says , restaurants want to care for people , Americans also want to be cared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or computer screen or just ambling in , they want to feel important . <p> At Bacar , the process of connecting begins when the telephone rings . Thompson leans in toward the computer screen with her pencil ready and starts to work . <p> " The music does n't begin until 10 and we serve until midnight , " she assures a caller looking for a Valentine 's Day dinner . These words coax the caller into accepting a 10:45 p.m. reservation , three-quarters of an hour later than what he or she had asked for . <p> O'Malley looks on admiringly . " She 's a pro , " he says , reaching for a football metaphor to describe her ability . " She thinks offensively but with a defensive set of mind . " <p> SOMETIMES , A MOUSE CAN BE A RESTAURATEUR 'S BEST FRIEND <p> The business of making and tracking reservations has gone high-tech . The paper book of yore is still around but more and more these days , particularly in the higher-end restaurants of the Bay Area , the reservation process is computerized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to OpenTable.com , a five-year old company headquartered in San Francisco . In exchange for a fee , which can range upward from a couple of hundred dollars a month , depending on the size of the desired system , a restaurant like Bacar can have tables booked " live " online without delay from anyone anywhere in the world with access to a computer . <p> This instant availability means the would-be diner can chose right then whether the day or time offered works for them . A restaurant can use the system to build databases on clients ' preferences , create mailing lists , and track how tables turn . <p> " We want the computer data so we can take care of our regular customers or family or friends , " says Charles Phan of Slanted Door in San Francisco . " This is a way anyone answering the telephone can recognize you . We can manage our customers better . " <p> So popular has this service become  --  there are now 350,000 registered OpenTable users  --  that even The French Laundry in Yountville has consented to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis and two tables for lunch on Friday , Saturday and Sunday . Would-be diners have to book two months in advance and the tables are not available at the best times . But still - anything beats trying to contact French Laundry by telephone , an often famously futile activity . <p> Most restaurants make available all of their inventory of tables online , says Thomas Layton , OpenTable.com 's chief executive officer . At Bacar , for example , reservationist Mary Thompson works with the same grid of open tables that the OpenTable computer does . <p> Not every restaurateur is a fan of OpenTable.com or other online reservation systems . <p> " We had it and got rid of it , " says Kirk Webber of Cafe Kati in San Francisco . " It took so much time to get into the computer . I want to greet a customer walking in with a smiling face . I do n't want someone with their head buried in a computer screen . " <p> Patricia Dailey , editor in chief of Restaurants and Institutions , a trade magazine based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " high touch " industry . <p> " Most restaurant-goers seem to be more comfortable with voice- <p> to-voice contact rather than turn the ( reservation ) experience over to technology , " she says . " They want to talk to a person in the restaurant , if they can . They want to know where they can park the car , what is the dress code , where 's the nearest cross street . " <p> TIPS ON GETTING A TABLE <p> Looking to snag a reservation at a hot restaurant ? Here are some tips from Bay area restaurateurs and industry insiders .. <p>  --  Be nice on the telephone . Good manners may or may not get you the table you desire but rudeness definitely wo n't . Remember who has the power here . <p>  --  Do n't pretend to be someone you are n't . Do n't pretend to be a friend of the chef or owner . ( Do n't try to play restaurant critic either ; the legit ones never announce themselves . ) <p>  --  Do n't act dumb . Pretending that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work if the Sunday in question is Mother 's Day . Ditto for that innocent " February 14 " dinner . If you want to dine out on a holiday , plan accordingly and book early . <p>  --  Cancel your reservation if you ca n't make it . Not only does it open the table for someone else but canceling keeps your record clean . Remember , computerized reservation systems can log not only how many visits you make but how many you blow off . <p>  --  Give the restaurant a heads-up if you 're going to be late and be patient if the restaurant ca n't seat you right away when you do arrive . " Your " table may have been given to someone else who was waiting . Conversely , do n't dawdle over dinner if you arrived late , you could cause a back-up for the table if the place is crowded and seating scarce . <p>  --  Be flexible in making reservations . Remember key tables and times tend to be reserved quickly or are set aside for VIP 's or friends of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular time , reserve well in advance . <p>  --  Check with a restaurant for last-minute cancellations . Plans always change and tables can open . <p>  --  Consider walking in , especially at larger restaurants with various dining options or spaces to wait . People do cancel or do n't show . Be willing to chill in the bar , if need be , or even take your dinner there . <p>  --  Confirmation by phone or e-mail when requested . Not only is it a good reminder of what you 've planned and helps guarantee your place , but confirmations help the restaurant arrange its nightly schedule . <p> E-mail Bill Daley at bdaley@sfchronicle.com.
