<p> Before too long , Wi-Fi will be bigger than Bud . <p> At least that 's the claim of the Wi-Fi Alliance , the trade association that promotes wireless networking based on the family of standards known as 802.11 . In a keynote earlier this month at a conference called 802.11 Planet , the group 's chairman , Dennis Eaton , displayed a chart showing that annual revenue from sales of Wi-Fi gear is on track to pass Budweiser 's $5 billion by the end of 2005 . <p> I do n't usually put much stock in such industry self-promotion , but I 'm a Wi-Fi booster myself . I first wrote about it 2 1/2 years ago in a column " Welcome to my wireless world , " where I described the pleasures of reading my e-mail at the kitchen table and surfing the Web from my sofa . <p> Although the equipment was still hard to find for Windows PCs , I thought I was on to something big , and the response to the column proved the point : It generated more than 300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before or since . <p> Since then Wi-Fi sales have soared , even as most other tech categories have staggered . Now virtually every computer and networking manufacturer is pushing wireless gear . <p> The industry 's two superpowers , Microsoft and Intel , have hopped on the bandwagon : The former has not only built good support for Wi-Fi into Windows XP , but also ( as my colleague Todd Wallack notes elsewhere on this page ) come out with its own line of networking hardware . <p> Intel is predicting that more than half the notebooks that use its chips next year will ship with wireless capability built in , so it has retooled its investment and development programs to give priority to this phenomenon . Just this month it joined with IBM and AT &T; in a new joint venture , Cometa Networks , to build and service 20,000 Wi-Fi hot spots ( public-access networks )  --  on top of the 12,000 that have already sprung up in recent years . <p> Altogether , Wi-Fi has been a big winner for the industry and its customers , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broadband connection at home . <p> There 's every reason to think that will continue , but there are some clouds that mar this rosy picture  --  some issues that generate anxiety and frustration among adopters of wireless technology . <p> One of them , as Wallack 's experience reveals , is initial setup It 's still complicated and fraught with hassles . The plain truth is that the rest of the industry still has n't caught up with the standard Apple set in this area three years ago when it introduced wireless networking to the consumer mainstream with its AirPort line . <p> For this week , though , I 'll leave that issue to Wallack , except to say that Microsoft 's promise of a breakthrough in ease of setup did n't work out any better for me that it did for him . Over the years , I 've set up more than a dozen Wi-Fi networks , usually with only minor hassles , but with Microsoft 's gear , it took me seven tries and two hours on the phone with a senior support technician to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future column I 'll address the problem of proliferating and sometimes conflicting wireless standards . <p> COMING SOON : SECURITY <p> Technology that was designed to keep casual passers-by or malicious hackers from exploiting your bandwidth and intercepting your data was designed into 802.11 from the start . For several reasons , though , it does n't work very well . <p> First , to avoid further complicating an already challenging setup process , most vendors of wireless equipment turn the built-in data-encryption scheme  --  called WEP , for Wired Equivalent Privacy  --  off by default , and many , probably most , users never bother to turn it on . <p> Second  --  again in an effort to make things easy  --  vendors often supply default values for some essential settings , such as the name ( " SSID " ) that will identify your local wireless network or the keyword used to decode scrambled data if you turn WEP on . <p> The trouble is , many users do n't bother to change these default values . Therefore , anyone who purchased gear from the same vendor or any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vendors has easy access to your network . <p> Third , even if you turn on all the standard security measures and configure them with values a stranger ca n't easily guess , you 're still vulnerable , at least to serious hackers . Although the encryption algorithm underlying WEP is sound , its implementation turns out to be deeply flawed ( as much in the 128-bit version , which was supposed to provide tighter security , as in the low-end 64-bit version ) . <p> A series of papers published last year by cryptography experts exposed these flaws , and software enabling hackers to take advantage of them quickly appeared on the Internet . Today anyone with this software , an ordinary laptop and an off-the-shelf wireless card can crack WEP and get on your network within an hour or two once they get within range . <p> Back in September 2001 , just weeks after the most devastating disclosure of WEP 's weaknesses , I reported that " it looks as though a relatively quick and painless fix may be in the offing . " The relevant standards committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis , had outlined a new security scheme , one that would supposedly be free of WEP 's flaws but compatible with most existing Wi-Fi hardware . <p> " With luck , " I wrote , based on interviews with representatives of the Wi-Fi trade association ( then known as WECA ) , " the fix should be ready this fall "  --  the fall of 2001 . <p> Unfortunately , it seems that Lady Luck is n't into wireless , or else she has her own security system . It took the technical experts more than a year to agree on the substance of a new plan , and they still have n't finished editing the technical document describing it . <p> The process is far enough along so companies are starting to engineer the plan , which is known as Wi-Fi Protected Access ( WPA ) , into their products . The Wi-Fi Alliance plans to start testing these products in February or so , to make sure different manufacturers ' implementations of the standard work together reliably . <p> Some wireless gear with WPA could be on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be out by April . You should be able to upgrade current cards and access points to the new standard by way of new software drivers and firmware updates . <p> Of course , there 's an important qualifier to all of those predictions : with luck . <p> WHAT IS TO BE DONE ? <p> Where does that leave consumers in the meantime ? If you do n't have wireless yet , you 're concerned about security and you do n't want to worry about having to update your equipment in a few months , you might want to hold off until updated , compatibility-certified products are available . <p> But then you 'd be missing out on the joys of Wi-Fi until then . If you do n't want to wait or if you already have Wi-Fi , there are steps you can take that will provide effective security against casual snoops , if not against determined and knowledgeable hackers : <p>  --  Turn on WEP , for what it 's worth . <p>  --  Make sure your network name and WEP key are not the defaults , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p>  --  If your configuration software has a feature called closed network , access control or something similar , you can set it so only machines with IP numbers you specify will be allowed on the network . <p>  --  If you 're connecting to your company network , you should be using an add-on data-scrambling software called a virtual private network ( VPN ) . Talk to your IT department . <p> Aside from these wireless-specific issues , it 's extra-important for home users with wireless to take the basic precautions anyone with a broadband connection should : <p>  --  Make sure the firewall features built into your router  --  the device at the center of your network  --  are fully enabled . Most routers today have such capabilities , and as far as I can tell , they 're usually on by default , but it pays to check . Look in the manual that came with the device , then in your software settings , which in most cases you can get to with just a Web browser . <p>  --  If you do n't use file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gives machines on your network access to files on others  --  turn it off . ( For specific instructions , look up sharing in your computer 's electronic help system . ) If you share files occasionally but not regularly , consider leaving sharing off except when you 're actually using it . <p> ONLINE INFO FOR NETWORK NOVICES <p> Here are some places that have more information on Wi-Fi : <p>  --  For some basic background on wired and wireless home networking , see two recent Tech21 columns : " How to network your home " ( **34;4695;TOOLONG ? **47;4731;TOOLONG ) and " Wireless comes of age " ( **34;4780;TOOLONG ? **47;4816;TOOLONG ) . <p>  --  There 's a lot of useful information about both wired and wireless networking at www.homenethelp.com .
