<p> Winder  --  All around him , stress levels were rising like the floodwaters in New Orleans . <p> Ernie Alexander , part of the seat installer crew on the 6 a.m. shift at the Doraville General Motors plant , saw flashes of frustration over the past few months as co-workers wrestled with buyout options and the industrial landmark 's looming demise . <p> He was on the high ground of calm , having made what he considers a no-brainer decision to leave GM after 22 years to take another " job "  --  one with substantially lower pay , lousy hours and frequent anxiety-inducing demands : Operator of homeless shelters . <p> Alexander , along with wife Fawn , flung wide the doors Sunday night to a new 40-bed habitat in this town 25 miles west of Athens . For 2 1/2 years , their spare time has been gobbled up with managing a cramped , aged shelter around the corner that sleeps 12 . <p> Not exactly the golf-and-travel lifestyle of a typical retiree . But Alexander , a young and energetic 49 , relishes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " We feel it was divine . . . being able to help make a difference in someone 's life , " said Alexander , sitting on a couch encased in sheer plastic wrapping before the 3,000-square-foot building opened for business . A fresh paint smell permeated the two-story structure . <p> " It 's rewarding to see a person come in , not sure what 's going on in his life , and see him ease up after two or three days , " he said . " Then , give them the opportunity to get to the next level . " <p> Two years and counting <p> Doraville 's 3,100 assembly plant workers have until June 23 to choose from a menu of retirement options or opt out and stay at the plant . It 's expected to go lights-out in mid-2008 . <p> By the middle of May , 714 Doraville workers  --  like Alexander  --  had signed on to GM 's so-called attrition program . <p> Workers with up to 10 years of service can walk with $70,000 . The next level of seniority , ranging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30-plus gang , already eligible for retirement benefits , can sail away with an extra $35,000 . Those within three years of 30 qualify for a slightly smaller inducement . <p> Many workers have seized the chance to enter untrodden fields , a few even enrolling in college or trade school to prepare for life beyond automaking . Then there is Alexander and his unique occupational move . <p> " Brother Alexander is on the right track in using buyout money to start a new career , " said Willie Monroe , president of UAW Local 10 . " This is a noble gesture . " <p> The plant could shut down sooner than expected , given the company 's dicey financial situation . Workers who decline the buyout and hang on would face transfer to other areas . <p> With Alexander , that specter made for an easy call . He could not abandon the abandoned  --  the unsettled who temporarily need a roof , a meal and a mattress . <p> " It 's not just the indigent anymore , the war veteran , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> ' Masses ' moving to Winder <p> The inspiration to birth a shelter originated one night with his wife , a licensed street minister , while they prepared dinner at home in nearby Bethlehem . <p> He stopped peeling the potatoes and said , " But we do n't know anybody in Winder . " <p> They soon verified that the county seat of Barrow , the nation 's 20th fastest-growing county , had homeless issues . <p> " It 's from the masses that are moving here , " Winder Mayor Buddy Ouzts said . <p> A vacant dwelling provided the first crash pad for up to a dozen homeless beginning in early 2004 . <p> Fawn was nearby , having landed a position with the local Chamber of Commerce . Ernie continued his 33-minute commute to the plant five days a week , then would head for the shelter around supper hour and bunk overnight on a couch while working " security . " <p> " It was causing somewhat of a challenge , " he said , sleep deprivation being a primary contributor . <p> ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexander held off signing the buyout papers . He did not share most of his colleagues ' take on the $140,000 lump-sum payment to workers with 10-plus years as generous . " I was n't overly excited about the amount we were offered , " he said , noting the absence of extras such as tuition reimbursement . <p> Besides , Alexander had felt snug beneath the GM security blanket : Do your 30 years , blow out the candles and kick back . The company had transferred him from Grand Rapids , Mich. , his native soil , in 1997 , and he anticipated punching the clock in Doraville for another decade . <p> " He 's a GM man , " his wife , now employed by the city of Winder , said . <p> As storm clouds began building over the company a few years ago , the couple  --  with youngsters 16 , 12 and 11  --  pledged to eliminate debt . They paid off credit cards and their car note even as they pumped their own earnings into the older shelter . <p> So , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept it and remove the risk of relocating . Ernie could devote all waking hours  --  and , if necessary , some dollars  --  to his passion . " It was like a breath of fresh air to us , " Fawn said . <p> More than ' a hot and a cot ' <p> With the city 's homeless population growing , the Alexanders craved more space than was available in the existing shelter , the size of a single-family home . Fawn scored with several applications for grants . Her ministry 's request for funding from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development , funneled through the state Department of Community Affairs , was approved for $15,000 . <p> She also tapped into corporate and foundation sources . A local landowner donated two lots on which two homes were torn down to clear room . Others chipped in building supplies , architectural designs , furniture , carpet , linens  --  along with time and sweat . The bigger , better shelter  --  1 1/2 years in the making  --  is valued at $273,000 for insurance purposes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide more than , in the vernacular of shelters , a " hot and a cot . " He proudly pointed to a section to be stocked with computers , obtained gratis . The front area is expansive enough to accommodate classes on anger and money management , job skills and Bible study . <p> " A magnificent place , " he said . " We 're still shocked at the outpouring of support . " <p> As administrator , one of two paid positions to complement seven volunteers , he will pocket $15,000 a year , compared with the $50,000 earned at GM . <p> " It 's put a little financial stress on us , " he said , " but we can handle it . " <p> It 's nothing like the tension that surrounded him at times in the plant . He blames GM partly for its predicament , claiming it did not adjust to global change in automaking . He also maintains the company was a victim of circumstances , unable to overhaul an organization that had served well a previous generation of car customers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of workers wo n't have the opportunity that I have  --  to get out of there and land on their feet . " <p> His farewell shift , on a Monday in May , was unceremonious , even melancholy . There was no " retirement walk " through the plant . No cutting of cake or pouring of punch . And no after-work party . A couple of homeless shelters , one that was still in the making , awaited him . <p> He is attending class on counseling substance abuse to better deal with addicts who check in . He is pursuing a minister 's license . And he is exploring the launch of a lawn care business , involving his kids , to occupy daytime hours and replace some lost income . <p> " I have n't really had a chance to enjoy retirement , " Alexander said , rising from the couch to apply the final touches on what will become his home away from home  --  and temporary home to others without one .
