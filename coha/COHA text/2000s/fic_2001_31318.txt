Dr. McCoy joined the captain and Spock to prepare for transport . The transporter was n't one of his favorite pieces of technology , but this time he was almost eager to be split into a billion bits . Anything to get off this blighted dustball and back to civilization . He had been forced to sleep in the dirt last night , but at least he had been on top of it rather than under a tomb of rocks , like Senior Geologist D'Amato . Their rescue had been close none of the landing party had had a sip of water for nearly twenty-four hours . He , for one , was ready for a hot meal and a long sonic shower . Sulu also took his position in the proscribed circle for transport . He was holding his arm again , in pain from the injured shoulder . Dehydration had aggravated the wound . McCoy tensed , anticipating the familiar tug of the transporter . The chamber seemed to sparkle and fade . But it was only for a moment . Then they were back again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern technology ! " McCoy exclaimed . " How can anyone trust these things ? " Kirk flipped his communicator open . " Enterprise , what happened ? " " Sir ! " The voice of the transporter operator wavered . " The automatic sequence was interrupted by a biofilter alert . There is an unknown organism in your systems . " McCoy unslung his medical tricorder . " It must be the organism that the Kalandans accidentally created . " Spock also began to scan the chamber . Security Guard Joe Reinhart , a big , stocky man , looked distinctly uncomfortable . Pulling out the tiny medical scanner , McCoy checked Reinhart . " Go ahead and breathe . It 's already infected all of us . " " Fascinating , " Spock murmured . " There are several unusual parasites on this planetoid . " " The one inside us does n't appear to be a true virus , but it 's certainly not bacterial . " McCoy shook his head over his medical scanner . " This thing ca n't seem to pinpoint the exact nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be why the transporter biofilter did n't work . " " I 'll have to perform a level one bio-scan , " McCoy agreed . " That will give the computer the specifications it needs . " Sulu was looking bleak . " That could take hours . " Kirk glanced around the chamber , placing his fists on his hips . " Gentlemen , it looks like we 'll be here for a while longer . Might as well make ourselves comfortable . " McCoy grumbled , " Sure , you get comfortable while I get to work . " " Are n't doctors always on call ? " The captain adjusted the dial on his communicator . " Kirk to Enterprise . No one , I repeat , no one is to transport down to the station until further orders . " Scotty sounded determined . " Aye , sir . I wish Wyatt was here . He was a genius with biofiltration systems . I 'll just run down " " Hold on there , Scotty . What happened to Wyatt ? " Kirk glanced at Spock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Captain , Transporter Chief Wyatt was killed at his station . " Kirk clenched his jaw while McCoy felt his stomach twist . None of them had wanted to believe the transporter chief was dead . Wyatt had been seeing one of McCoy 's nurses for the past year . Medical Technician Michaels must be distraught right now . Security Guard Reinhart was looking uncomfortable . " We never found the intruder who killed Wyatt or Engineer Watkins . " " Watkins , too ? " Kirk demanded . Now he looked angry . " How ? " Scotty must have thought the question was directed at him . " According to Dr. M'Benga 's autopsy , Captain , every cell in their bodies was disrupted . We don ' know how it happened , but I heard Watkins call out a warning about a woman in engineering . " " Could it have been Losira ? " Sulu asked , startled . " I do n't doubt it , " Kirk said flatly . That made three crew members dead . McCoy sincerely hoped they would be the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that easy . Scotty was saying , " I ran to help , Captain , but I dinna get there in time . " " It 's not your fault , Scotty . None of us could stop her . " " Aye , Captain . " Scotty sounded unconvinced . " Maintain an open channel to sickbay so Dr. McCoy can perform a level one bio-scan . " " That we can do , Captain . " " And Scotty , perform a continuous scan of this sector for approaching ships . Since this is unexplored territory , there 's no telling who might happen by . " " Aye , " Scotty agreed dourly . " We 'll keep an eye out up here . Don ' you worry about that . " McCoy half-listened while Spock continued briefing Kirk on what had happened while the landing party was stranded . The captain only interrupted once to express shock at the extreme warp speed the Enterprise had managed to sustain . What would normally take months to travel at warp 9 , had taken little more than a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act like it was all in a normal day 's work . Meanwhile , McCoy started sending orders to Dr. M'Benga in sickbay . Not only did he order a portable bio-computer and diagnostic unit , but he also asked the technicians to send down half-a-dozen emergency ration kits , complete with food and water . It was n't as good as a sonic shower , but with a little bit of nourishment inside him , he could tackle this organism and get them back to the ship before the next duty-shift . Near the Starfleet border , the cruiser ' Ong of the Klingon Defense Force made its scheduled rounds . Captain Mox had been spending most of his time in his own narrow quarters . Only Mox knew why , but his crew would find out soon enough . Any time now , one of his officers would receive tidings from Qo'noS containing the latest news of his father , Sowron . As a devoted follower of the Cult of Kahless , Mox believed in honor above all . Kahless had shown the way , decreeing that a warrior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house . And Mox 's father had no honor ! Mox slammed his fist into the reinforced wall above his sleep bench . There was a sour stench in the air from his unwashed , unkempt body . For days he had battered the walls of his chamber , to no avail . He kept the lights low , so the heavy bulkheads curved into the darkness over his head . He wanted no witness to his struggle , not even himself . His crew would never understand . He was the only one on board who adhered to Kahless ' teachings . Some of his crew complained about his strict adherence to honor . Their scorn would flow freely when they found out about his father . Many would doubtless be amused that Sowron had squandered the family fortune on attempted " cures " after he had fallen sick with a wasting illness . Then Sowron had fallen down dead in the City Council Chamber in front of gathered officials from across the Klingon Empire , struck down by a tiny parasite that had slowly eaten away his gut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought of it . He would not return for his father 's funeral . His father was nothing to him now . He could find no resolution , as much as he tore at his armor and hair , growling in frustration . If only he could go to battle ! Only that would restore honor to his family . No if only his father had listened to the words of Kahless ! A true Klingon would have ended his life in glory , choosing a valiant enemy to battle his way to death . But no , not his father . From a mighty house , they had fallen far . Mox was in the foulest of tempers when his first officer signaled . Gulda 's surly face was the same as usual , her frizzy brown hair standing on end . " Captain ! Long-range sensors are picking up the remnants of a power surge . From the degradation of the signal , it appears that , at the source , the energy expended would have been off the scale . " Mox called up the log on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . " It comes from near Federation territory . " " Yes , Captain . Shall I relay the information to High Command ? " There was an odd look in Gulda 's eyes , no doubt taking in her captain 's disheveled armor and his bleeding fists . Mox made his decision . " Set course for the source of that power surge . " " But , Captain " his first officer protested , her sneer becoming more pronounced . " TammoH ! " Mox shouted . So Gulda knew . That meant they all knew . She was sullen as Mox ordered , " Proceed at warp 8 . " " By your command , Captain ! " She did him the courtesy of waiting until Mox closed the channel first . Mox knew his first officer would do as he said , but her slow response would show her disdain . His crew would mock his dishonor as surely as they had chafed under his rules . All of his warriors would react like Gulda . But none would dare break rank and contact Klingon High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the furthest reaches of space , where the Neutral Zone had not yet been designated . It was one vast , unexplored zone , so , technically , Mox was not violating orders . Before his dishonor , he would have been satisfied to report the unusual power surge to High Command . His duty rotation would have taken him out of the area before his superiors could determine whether they wanted the phenomenon investigated . Now , it was in his hands . Mox intended to wrest some glory from this mission if it took every drop of blood in his body and that of his crew to do it . He would give his crew a chance to die a good and noble death . Whether they appreciated it or not . While McCoy analyzed the bio-readings of the deadly organism , Spock took the opportunity to examine the computer cube . At his request , the Enterprise sent down a lift unit to raise him up to the crumpled rock ceiling of the chamber . Getting the outer casing off proved to be a challenge , but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ceiling with electrostatic bolts . With the muted colors still cycling over the surface , Spock laid the cube on one of the telescoping supports of the lift . Inside the cube were hundreds of thousands of monofilaments connecting to various devices , which Spock proceeded to scan . The other ends of the monofilaments disappeared into a stasis-sealed junction in the rock ceiling . Spock theorized that the cube was an interface node , operated by a computer in a remote location via the monofilaments . That theory was confirmed by the statements made by Losira in her message concerning the computer defense system . However , he was unable to trace the monofilaments beyond the edge of the wall , where they disappeared behind the diburnium-osmium alloy . Even the sensors on the Enterprise were n't able to detect anything beneath the layer of diburnium and osmium . These alloys should not be capable of blocking their sensors , so Spock surmised that something else was contributing to the sensor block . Due to McCoy 's unfortunate habit of talking aloud while he worked , Spock was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own investigation . The doctor evidently considered the organism to be a " near-virus . " There were subatomic anomalies that McCoy could n't explain , but the doctor repeatedly assured Captain Kirk that a basic identification should be enough for the transporter to filter the organisms out of their systems . Spock was familiar with an antiquated human quote about protesting too much , but he refrained from comment . McCoy downloaded his work and transmitted the specs of the organism to the ship 's computer . " That should do it . Now the biofilter will be able to handle this bug . " Kirk jumped up , ready to go . Spock followed at a slower pace . He intended to return to the Kalandan station at his earliest convenience to continue his investigation . " Prepare to transport , " Kirk ordered . The five crew members stood in a circle , anticipating transport . The degree of muscular tension in Kirk 's stance indicated that he was impatient to return to the Enterprise . He was naturally concerned about the damage done to the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred in almost every system . The fused matter/antimatter integrator had severely damaged the warp engines . At the time of the crisis , Spock had estimated their chances of survival were a mere twelve percent . However , Mr. Scott had performed his job adequately , and the engines were shut down by a manual bypass of the integrator . " Energize , " Kirk ordered into the communicator . There was a brief disorientation as dematerialization began . But the cycle ceased 1.204 seconds into the sequence . The landing party remained on the Kalandan station . " What in blue blazes is this thing ! " McCoy exploded . " I do n't know , Doctor , but it 's your job to find out . " Kirk adjusted his communicator . " Scotty , as you can see , it did n't work . " " Aye , Captain . There appears t ' be a problem with the quantum differentials . " Kirk gave Dr. McCoy a sidelong glance . " We 'll factor that into our calculations . " Snapping the communicator closed , Kirk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , I ca n't even tell if it 's an organism that mimics a virus or the other way around , " McCoy wearily admitted . " I 'm not sure how we got infected , though it 's most likely airborne , because it happened so quickly . " Spock ascertained that the doctor was paler than normal . Humans had a tendency to react adversely when deprived of their comforts , McCoy more so than others , in his opinion . Indeed , Kirk ordered , " Why do n't you get some rest , Bones ? Now that the ship has your specs on the organism , the medical staff can take over your analysis . " McCoy hardly protested before going to lie down next to Sulu , flinging one arm over his eyes to shield them from the bright ambient light . Security Guard Reinhart was seated on the other side of the chamber , keeping watch on the doorway . His phaser hung loosely in his hand . Spock climbed back up on the lift and recommenced his analysis of the devices inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of omnidirectional diodes . Several of the components formed advanced forcefield projection units and graviton beam emitters . There was also a targeting scanner , with a protected feed through the rock ceiling . As absorbing as his investigation was , Spock was distracted by the captain 's pacing through the chamber . After a while , as Kirk continued his restless back-and-forth march , Spock finally leaned over the railing of the lift . " You are disturbed , Captain . May I be of assistance ? " " Find me that computer , Spock . I want to see the machine that 's capable of transporting a starship a thousand light-years away . " Spock knew there was no need to correct Kirk 's approximation at this moment . " I am currently endeavoring to do so , Captain . " " Yes , I know , Spock . But it makes me antsy to be sitting on top of that much power . It 's here somewhere and we have to find it . " Kirk narrowed his eyes . " That energy burst was off the scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Indeed , that is a reasonable assumption , Captain . " Kirk glanced over at the stash of phasers the Enterprise had sent down , then at Reinhart , who was watching the doorway . " Our position is too vulnerable . " He flipped open his communicator . " Kirk to Enterprise . " " Scotty here , Captain . " " Any sign of ships in this sector ? " " No , sir ! " Spock discerned relief in the engineer 's voice . Apparently Kirk heard it , too . " We 're lighting up the sensors down here , are n't we ? " " Aye , Captain , yer lifesigns read clear though the rock . The tricorders and diagnostic unit are also sending out power spikes . " Kirk considered the options . " Scotty , tell me more about that portable shield you 've been working on . " Scotty 's voice warmed like he was talking about an old friend . " She 's making progress , Captain ! I just finished synchronizing th ' forcefield frequencies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Scotty , does it work ? Can it hide the entrance to this station ? " " She 's got a few bugs yet , sir . But I think she 'll do the trick for ye , " Scott said approvingly . " Ye never know who might come nosing around at this end of th'quadrant . The Klingon border is n't far from here . " Spock believed it was a measure of Kirk 's agitation that he agreed , " Send it on down , Scotty . " Kirk figured it was worth a try . Scotty had pulled off miracles enough times before that he would n't doubt his chief engineer now . Not long after Scotty signed off , a bulky gray unit materialized on the polished floor of the chamber . It was a double square joined together by a fat Y-junction . There were several aerial feeds on top . The dials on the side were activated , and the power cells were fully charged . Kirk circled it . The unit did n't look very impressive . Was this why Scotty had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxing and joining crew activities ? " Reinhart , you 're with me . " Kirk grabbed one handle of the portable shield unit while Reinhart took the other . Spock raised one brow , making a silent commentary on the probable effectiveness of Scotty 's latest pet project . Kirk gave Spock a warning look , and the Vulcan complacently returned to his examination of the computer node in the ceiling . Now that the neat cubical covering had been removed , the node looked like an explosion of monofilaments and inverter nodules . Reinhart helped Kirk carry the shield unit up the passageway that doubled back to the doorway . Kirk realized something was different it was darker in the passageway than before . It turned out that the door was down , shutting them inside the station . But as Kirk and Reinhart approached , the panel abruptly slid up into the rock . After a moment , the large slab that concealed the doorway moved aside . " It must be automated , " Reinhart ventured . The dusty surface of the planetoid was the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was only slightly darker than normal . The yellow-blue blades of grass growing in the lower cracks of the rocks appeared to be barely clinging to life . Reinhart looked around with interest , having never seen the surface of the planetoid before . " Where do you want this , sir ? " " Over here . " Kirk was trying to remember the instructions Scotty had poured through the communicator . In his opinion , Scotty needed to scale down on the operating requirements to make the shield more user-friendly . He and Reinhart carried the shield unit to a spot just outside the sliding rock slab . It would probably close again once they went inside , and would add another layer of protection for the landing party . Kirk activated the levelers and checked the imager to make sure the shield would encompass the entire rock mass . There was room to spare , so he tightened the parameters . Reinhart took care to stand inside the area Kirk indicated . Then it took numerous tiny adjustments to get the gauges pointing in the same direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're going under the shield . Maintain an open channel at all times . " Kirk activated the shield . A hum rose from the unit , and a faint pearlized sheen appeared . From the outside , everything would look exactly the same , with the shield unit concealed within . Or so Scotty said . Kirk sniffed . It smelled like hair was burning , but he could see no smoke coming from the unit . " What do you get , Scotty ? " Kirk asked . " Sensors reading no life-forms , Captain . No power spikes . She did it ! " His voice broke with emotion . " That 's a fine piece of machinery , sir ! " It did n't take much to make Scotty happy . Just a few circuits and microchips did the job . " Good work . Kirk out . " He was pocketing his communicator . " Well , that will " The doorway slid down and the rock slab suddenly began to move . Kirk pushed Reinhart out of the way . They both ended up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches in front of their noses . It stopped short of the shield unit . " Sir ? " Reinhart asked uncertainly . Kirk had n't expected the rock slab to close until they were inside , but he was n't going to admit that to his security guard . The shield would let them step through , from the inside out . But then they would n't be able to get back in again until someone inside the station deactivated the shield . " We got in before , Reinhart , we 'll get in again . " " Yes , sir ... but how ? " Reinhart was splayed against the rock slab . Kirk was similarly stuck . Whenever he brushed against the shield , there was static discharge . He tried to remember what had happened when the landing party had found the entrance to the Kalandan station . " We were tracking the power surge , and the indicator on my tricorder pointed directly to this rock outcropping . " " Do you have your tricorder ? " Reinhart asked hopefully . " It 's inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a few static sparks . He pressed his lips together against an unseemly exclamation . " It was the only time the power surge did n't disappear , so we were able to track it . " Kirk thought hard about what he 'd done . " We walked right up this slab . The tricorder said the entrance was here " The rock slab shifted . Kirk peeled himself off the shield , pulling Reinhart with him . Then the doorway slid up , revealing the passageway into the station . Kirk straightened his uniform . " An effective system , I 'm sure Mr. Spock would say . " " Yes , sir , " Reinhart said , in obvious relief . As they reentered the main chamber , Spock glanced down . " Any trouble , Captain ? " " None , Mr. Spock . " Reinhart took a deep breath . Whatever he had been about to say was lost in his shout . " Watch out ! She 's back ! " The humming came from the wall behind Kirk , where Losira appeared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replica , but merely an image on the wall . Losira 's beauty always had the same impact . There was something very appealing about the way her eyes slanted upward at the outer edges . He even liked the streaks of pink and green , and that unusual purple uniform . Reinhart had his phaser out , pointing it at the rock wall . Spock also turned , aiming his tricorder at the image . Her lips opened briefly in a slight smile . " My fellow Kalandans , welcome . A disease has destroyed us . Beware of it . After your long journey , I 'm sorry to give you only a recorded welcome ... " " It 's the same message , " Kirk said . " It must have been triggered by our entrance . " Spock agreed . " Which means this image is controlled by other means than this damaged computer node . " " Perhaps the computer is capable of repairing itself . " That was n't exactly a comforting notion , considering how the computer had operated . " Unlikely , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emissions from this computer node . It is currently inert . " The image of Losira was saying , " The computer will selectively defend against all life-forms except our own . My fellow Kalandans , I , Losira , wish you well . " Losira closed her eyes and stood impassively , waiting as she had for hundreds of years . " Did your tricorder get all that , Mr. Spock ? " Spock nodded affirmatively . " Send it to the Enterprise . I 'll include it in my subspace report to Starfleet . They must be informed that a weapon of this power exists . " After a few moments , Losira 's image disappeared . Kirk figured that would be the last time he ever saw her . But if they could penetrate this station somehow , there might be more wonders to discover . Kirk settled onto a folding stool near the lift unit while Security Guard Reinhart resumed his post , keeping watch on the entrance . With a minimum of words , Kirk recorded his message to Starfleet and filed his log on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he was in command of the Enterprise . As auxiliary documents , Kirk included Losira 's message and Dr. McCoy 's specs on the deadly organism . Kirk concluded his message by saying , " I believe this station is worth further investigation , if only to ensure that the defense system is fully deactivated . Request permission to remain in this sector . Another ship can take over our diplomatic assignment in the Cister system . " They would be late reporting to that engagement now , at any rate . " I await your decision . Kirk out . " Kirk sent the message to Uhura on the Enterprise , asking her to encode it at the top security level . No need to let anyone else know about the incredible technology concealed on this planetoid . Kirk was dozing fitfully when Spock informed him that the Enterprise had signaled with a coded transmission that had arrived from Starfleet Command . Kirk stumbled up from the bedroll , noting that both Sulu and McCoy continued to sleep . Even Reinhart was snoring lightly , slumped in his post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kirk sat down with the portable communications unit to listen to the message . It was from Commodore Enwright , which meant Starfleet considered this to be a matter of galactic defense . Enwright 's smooth , dark face was impassive as usual , giving no indication of his inner thoughts . But Kirk could guess at the commodore 's mood ; Enwright was known for his sour temper and rigid adherence to duty . " Captain Kirk , send a full report , including technical data regarding the interstellar transporter you have discovered . Do not , I repeat , do not allow that technology to fall into enemy hands , especially those of the Klingons or the Romulans . We must protect the balance of power in this quadrant . Understood ? " the commodore demanded . Kirk understood . The Romulans could use an interstellar transporter to send assassins into the very heart of the Federation . The Klingons would undoubtedly want to know the secret of cellular disruption , to incorporate it into their own weapons . Armed with his orders , Kirk went to help Spock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was up to him to make sure the Kalandan station was protected .
