" Madness ! " I muttered . " Davus , I knew it was a mistake to leave the road . Shortcut indeed ! " " But , father-in-law , you heard what the man at the tavern said . The road to Massilia is n't safe . The Massilians are all shut up inside the city , under siege . And Caesar 's troops are too busy laying the siege to bother with patrolling the road . Gaulish bandits are running wild , waylaying anyone who dares to take the road . " " A Gaulish bandit might not be entirely unwelcome at the moment . At least he might give us directions . " I studied the bewildering prospect around us . Gradually we had made our way into a long , narrow valley , the cliffs on either side rising in imperceptible degrees around us like stone giants slowly lifting their heads , and now we found ourselves surrounded on all sides by sheer walls of pale limestone . A stream , almost dry at the end of a long , dry summer , trickled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small trees . Our horses delicately picked their way around jagged rocks and gnarled tree roots as thick as a man 's arm . It was slow going . Early that morning we had set out from the tavern . We had taken the tavernkeeper 's advice to abandon the flat , wide , finely wrought Roman road almost at once . As long as we used the sun to stay on a southerly course and moved in a generally downhill direction toward the sea , we could n't possibly miss Massilia , the tavernkeeper had said , especially with so many of Caesar 's troops camped before it . Now , as the sun began to drop behind the western cliffs of the valley , I was beginning to think the fellow had played a nasty joke on us . Shadows deepened among the boulders . Tree roots , wildly splayed over the stony ground , seemed to quicken and quiver in the dim light . Again and again , from the corner of my eye I imagined thick clumps of snakes writhing amid the rocks . The horses appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shied and tested their hooves against the knotted roots . Not knowing how we had entered the valley , I was equally uncertain how to get out of it . I tried to reassure myself . The sun had disappeared behind the cliffs to our right , so we had to be traveling south . We were following the direction of the stream , which meant we were probably headed seaward . South and seaward , just as the tavernkeeper had advised . But where in Hades were we ? Where was Massilia , with Caesar 's army camped before it ? And how could we exit this hall of stone ? A band of lurid sunlight lit up the highest reaches of the eastern cliffs to our left , turning the chalk-white stone blood-red . The glare was blinding . When I lowered my eyes , the deepening shadows around us seemed even darker . The bubbling water in the stream looked black . A warm breeze sighed through the valley . Sounds and sights became deceptive , uncertain ; in the stirring of the leaves I heard men moaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces , tormented bodies , impossible freaksthen as suddenly vanished back into the stone . Despite the warm breeze , I shivered . Riding behind me , Davus whistled a tune that a wandering Gaulish singer had performed at the tavern the previous night . Not for the first time in the twenty-odd days since we left Rome , I wondered if my imperturbable son-in-law was truly fearless , or if he simply lacked imagination . Suddenly I gave a start . I must have pulled on the reins and expelled a noise of alarm , for my horse stopped short and Davus drew his short sword . " Father-in-law , what is it ? " I blinked . " Nothing .... " " But , father-in-law " " It was nothing , surely ... " I gazed into the murk of boulders and low branches . Amid the fleeting phantoms , I thought I had seen a face , a real face , with eyes that gazed backeyes that I recognized . " Father-in-law , what did you see ? " " I thought I saw ... a man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No . A man I once knew . But that would be ... impossible . " " Who was it ? " " His name was Catilina . " " The rebel ? But he lost his head ages ago , when I was a boy . " " Not so long agothirteen years . " I sighed . " But you 're right , Catilina was killed in battle . I saw his head myself ... mounted on a spike outside the tent of the general who defeated him . " " Well , then , it could n't have been Catilina you saw , could it ? " There was the slightest quaver of doubt in Davus 's voice . " Of course not . A trick of the light ... the shadow of some leaves on a stone ... an old man 's imagination . " I cleared my throat . " Catilina has been much in my thoughts these last few days , as we 've drawn closer to Massilia . You see , when he decided to flee from his enemies in Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean . Massilia is the end of the worldthe end of the road for Roman exiles , anywaya safe port for all the bitter losers and failed schemers who 've seen their hopes destroyed in Rome . At Massilia they find a welcomeprovided they arrive with enough gold to pay their way in . But not Catilina . In the end , he chose not to flee . He stood his ground and fought . And so he lost his head . " I shivered . " I hate this place ! All barren rock and stunted trees . " Davus shrugged . " I do n't know . I think it 's rather pretty . " I gave my horse a kick and moved on . By some magic of the hour , the gloom around us seemed not to deepen but to stay as it was , growing neither lighter nor darker . We had entered a twilight world where phantoms whispered and flitted among the trees . Behind me , most unnerving of all , Davus whistled , oblivious of the phantoms around us . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father-in-law , up ahead ! It looks like a temple of some sort .... " So it was . Abruptly we left the maze of boulders . The stream curved away to our left . The stone cliff to our right opened in a great semicircular curve , like a vast limestone amphitheater . A thin waterfall trickled from the overhanging summit . The wall was riven with springs . Ferns and moss grew out of the stone . The ground before us was flat . At some time long ago the space had been cleared and made into a vineyard . Tottering posts marked regular rows spaced well apart , but the vines , thick with leaves and heavy with dark grapes , were now madly overgrown in a wild tangle . Surrounding this vineyard was a peculiar-looking fence . As we drew closer , I saw that it was made of bonesnot animal bones but the bones of men , arm bones and leg bones nailed together and driven into the earth . Some of the bones had rotted and crumbled , turning dark brown or almost black . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pylons marked a gateway in the fence . The pylons were carved with reliefs depicting battle scenes . The victors wore armor and crested helmets in the style of Greek seafarers ; the vanquished were Gauls in leather britches and winged helmets . Beyond the gateway , broken paving stones choked with weeds led to a small , round temple with a domed roof at the center of the vineyard . I was transfixed by the strangeness of our surroundings . The gloom around us lifted a bit . The little temple seemed faintly to glow , as if the pale marble blushed in the twilight . Behind me Davus sucked in a breath . " Father-in-law , I know this place ! " " How , Davus ? From a dream ? " " No , from the tavern last night . This must be the place he sang about ! " " Who ? " " The traveling singer . After you went to sleep , I stayed up to listen . He sang about this place . " " How did the song go ? " " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sicily and arrived in these parts on the southern coast of Gaul . They founded a city and they called it Massilia . The Gauls welcomed them at first , but then there was troublebattlesa war . One of those battles happened in a narrow valley , where the Massilians trapped the Gauls and slaughtered them by the thousands . The blood that drained from the bodies made the soil so rich that grapevines sprang up overnight . The Massilians used the bones of the dead to build a fence around the vineyard . And the Gauls still sing a song about it . That 's the tune I 've been whistling all day . And here we are ! " " And the temple ? " " I do n't know about that . Built by the Massilians , I suppose . " " Shall we have a look ? Perhaps an offering to the local deity will help us find a way out of this accursed place . " We dismounted and tied our horses to iron rings in the pylons , then walked up the broken pathway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind . The sky overhead was underwater blue , streaked with coral tints of pink and yellow . We came to the steps of the temple and gazed up . Sculptures in relief decorated the entablatures that girdled the roof , but the paint on the marble was so faded that it was impossible to discern the images . We mounted the steps . A bronze door stood ajar on frozen hinges . I turned sideways and slipped inside . Davus , on account of his size , had to squeeze through . Despite small apertures near the ceiling , the light was very dim . The encircling walls faded into darkness . I had a sense of having entered a murky space with no perceptible boundaries . My eyes were drawn to a pedestal in the center of the room . There was something on the pedestal , a vague , unfamiliar shape . I took a step closer , straining my eyes . A hand gripped my shoulder . I heard the slither of steel drawn from a scabbard . I started , then felt warm breath in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on the pedestal ? " he whispered . " A man ? Or ? " I shared his confusion . The amorphous form atop the pedestal could hardly be the upright figure of a god . It might have been a man squatting on all fours , watching us . It might have been a Gorgon . My imagination ran riot . A burst of sound suddenly echoed through the templea sputtering , tittering , hissing noise . The sound came from the doorway behind us . I turned about . Because of the light beyond , I saw only a silhouette . For a moment I imagined a two-headed monster with spiky limbs was barking at us through the open doorway . Then I realized that the barking was suppressed laughter , and the two heads belonged to two mentwo soldiers to judge from their dully glinting helmets and mail shirts and the drawn swords in their fists . They were squeezed together into the breech , clutching each other and giggling . Davus stepped before me , clutching his sword . I pulled him back . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the pedestal ? " " Who ? " I began to say . " What ? " " Listen to that , Marcus , the old one speaks Latin ! " said the soldier . " You 're not a Gaul then ? Or some Massilian who 's slipped the noose ? " I took a deep breath and drew myself up . " I 'm a Roman citizen . My name is Gordianus . " The soldiers stopped their tittering and disengaged from one another . " And the big fellowyour slave ? " " Davus is my son-in-law . Who are you ? " One soldier put his shoulder to the door and pushed it open another foot . The screech from the hinges set my teeth on edge . His companion , who did all the talking , crossed his arms . " We 're soldiers of Caesar . We ask the questions . Do you need to know more than that , citizen Gordianus ? " " That depends . Knowing your names might prove useful the next time I speak to Gaius Julius . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ensuing silence I knew I had stumped them . Did I really know their imperator well enough to call him by his first name ? I might be bluffingor not . In a world turned upside-down by civil war , it was hard to know how to judge a stranger met in a strange placeand surely there were few places stranger than this . The soldier cleared his throat . " Well , citizen Gordianus , the first thing to do is to have that son-in-law of yours put his weapon away . " I nodded to Davus , who grudgingly sheathed his sword . " He did n't draw it against you , " I said . I glanced over my shoulder at the thing on the pedestal . In the greater light from the doorway , its shape was more defined , but still puzzling . " Oh , her ! " said the soldier . " Never fear , it 's only Artemis . " I frowned and studied the thing . " Artemis is the goddess of the hunt and of wild places . She carries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful . " " Then the Massilians have a strange idea of beauty , " said the soldier , " because this is the Temple of Artemis , and that ... whatever it is ... on the pedestal is the goddess herself . Would you believe they brought that thing all the way from Ionia when they migrated here five hundred years ago ? That was even before Romulus and Remus suckled the she-wolf , or so the Massilians claim . " " Are you saying a Greek sculpted this ? I can hardly believe that . " " Sculpt ? Did I say sculpt ? Nobody made that thing . It fell from the sky , trailing fire and smokeso the Massilians say . Their priests declared it was Artemis . Well , if you look at it from a certain angle you can sort of see ... " He shook his head . " Anyway , Artemis is who the Massilians worship above all the other gods . And this is the Artemis that belongs to them alone . They carve wooden copies of that thing , miniatures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman might keep a statue of Hermes or Apollo . " Peering at the thing on the pedestal , tilting my head , I discerned a form that might possibly be perceived as female . I could see pendulous breastsseveral more than twoand a swollen belly . There was no refinement , no artifice . The image was crude , basic , primal . " How do you know all this ? " I asked . The soldier puffed out his chest . " We know , my comrade Marcus and me , because we two are stationed to guard this place . While the siege is on , our job is to keep this temple and the surrounding grove safe from bandits and lootersthough what anybody would take I ca n't imagine , and you can see for yourself how the Massilians have let the place go to ruin . But once the siege is over , Caesar does n't want Pompey or anybody else to be able to say he was disrespectful of the local shrines and temples . Caesar honors all the godseven rocks that fall from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . " You 're an impious fellow , are n't you ? " He grinned . " I pray when I need to . To Mars before a battle . To Venus when I throw the dice . Otherwise , I do n't imagine the gods take much notice of me . " I dared to touch the thing on the pedestal . It was made of dark , mottled stone , shiny and impermeable in some places and in other places riddled with fine pores . Riding through the valley , I had seen phantom shapes , illusions of light and shadow , but none had been as strange as this . " It has a name , that sky rock , " offered the soldier . " But you have to be a Greek to be able to pronounce it . Impossible for a Roman " " Xoanon . " The voice came from somewhere within the temple . The strange wordif word it was , and not a cough or a sneezeboomed and echoed in the small space . The soldiers were as startled as I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rattled their swords . A cowled figure stepped from the shadows . He must have been there when Davus and I entered , but in the dimness we both had failed to see him . He spoke in a gruff , hoarse whisper . " The skystone is called a xoanon , and xoanon is what the Massilians call the images of Artemis they carve from wood . " The soldiers exhibited sudden relief . " Only you ! " said the one who did the talking . " I thoughtI did n't know what to think ! You gave us a start . " " Who are you ? " I asked . The man 's face was hidden by the cowl . " Are you the priest of this temple ? " " Priest ? " The soldier laughed . " Whoever saw a priest dressed in such rags ? " The cowled figure , without answering , stepped past him and out the door . The soldier pointed to his head and made a gesture to indicate that the man was mad . He lowered his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fellow 's dangerous , just not right in the head . " " Does he live here ? " " Who can say ? Showed up in camp not long after Caesar began the siege . Word came down from on high that we were to leave him alone . Comes and goes as he pleases . Disappears for a while , then pops up again . A soothsayer , they call him , though he does n't say much . As strange as they come , but harmless as far as I can tell . " " Is he Massilian ? " " Could be . Or could be a Gaul . Or a Roman , for all I know ; speaks Latin . He certainly knows a thing or two about local matters , as you 've just seen demonstrated . What 's that he called the lump on the pedestal ? " The soldier tried to duplicate the word without success . " Anyway , why do n't you and your son-in-law step out of the temple . It 's getting so you ca n't see your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We followed the soldiers onto the porch and descended the steps . The soothsayer stood outside the gate , where there were now five horses tied to the pylons . " So , Gordianus of Rome , what 's your business in being here ? " asked the soldier . " My immediate business is to find a way out of this valley . " He laughed . " Easy enough . Marcus and I will escort you out . In fact , we 'll escort you all the way to my commander 's tent . You being on a first-name basis with Gaius Julius , ' maybe you 'll feel more comfortable explaining yourself to an officer . " He looked at me sidelong . " Whoever you are , I do n't mind saying I 'm glad you turned up today . It 's slow out here , so far away from the action . You two are the first visitors we 've had to the temple . Are you sure you 're not looters ? Or spies ? Only joking ! " We readied our horses . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment . The soldier called to us over his shoulder . " Rabidus says he wants to ride alongside us for a while . You do n't mind , do you ? " I watched the cowled figure mount his swayback nag and shrugged . The soldiers led the way to a narrow cleft in the stone wall . The opening was impossible to see unless viewed straight on . I doubted that Davus and I would ever have found it by ourselves , even in broad daylight . A rocky path led between sheer limestone walls so close I could have touched both sides with outstretched arms . The passage was deep in shadow , almost as dim as the interior of the temple . My horse began to jerk in protest at being ridden over rough , unfamiliar ground in near darkness . At last a vertical slash of pale light appeared ahead of us . The path descended , dropping like a staircase . We emerged from the fissure as abruptly as we had entered it . Behind us rose a sheer cliff of limestone . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How can we ride through that wilderness at night ? " I asked Davus in a hushed voice . " These woods must go on for miles ! " A voice startled me . It was the soothsayer . I had thought he was ahead with the soldiers , but suddenly he was alongside me . " Nothing in this place is what it appears to be , " he whispered hoarsely . " Nothing ! " Before I could answer , the soldiers doubled back , edging out the soothsayer and hemming Davus and me in on either side like sheep to be herded . Did they really think we might try to escape into that deep , dark wood ? But the forest was not as vast as it appeared to be . We rode through the enveloping gloom for only a moment , then suddenly emerged into a vast clearing . The last glow of twilight illuminated a landscape of endless tree stumps . The forest had been razed . The soldier saw my confusion and laughed . " Caesar 's doing ! " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , he took one look at those thick city walls and decided an attack by sea might be advisable . Only problem : no ships ! So Caesar decided to build a navy overnight . But to build ships you need big treescypresses , ash trees , oaks . Not many such trees in this rocky land ; that 's why the Massilians declared this forest sacred and never touched it , not for all the hundreds of years they 've been here . Gods lived in this wood , so they said , gods who 'd been here since long before the Massilians came , gods so old and hidden in the gloom that even the Gauls had no names for them . The place was rank and wild , powdery beneath your feet from so much rotted heartwood over the years , with cobwebs the size of houses up in the branches . The Massilians built altars , sacrificed sheep and goats to the unknown gods of the forest . They never touched the trees for fear of some horrible , divine retribution . " But that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those trees , ' he ordered , and build me my ships ! ' But the men he ordered to do the cutting got spooked . They froze up , could n't bring down their axes . Stood staring at each other , quivering like schoolboys . Men who 'd burned cities , slaughtered Gauls by the thousands , scared Pompey himself out of Italyafraid to attack a forest . Caesar was furious ! He grabbed a double-headed ax from one of the men , pushed the fellow out of the way , and started hacking at the biggest oak in sight . Wood chips flew through the air ! The old oak creaked and groaned ! Caesar did n't stop until the tree came crashing down . Everyone fell to chopping after that . Afraid Caesar might come after them with that ax ! " The soldier laughed . I nodded . My horse seemed glad to be away from narrow , rocky places . He had no trouble picking his way between tree stumps . " But if this wood was sacred ... I thought you said Caesar was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The soldier snorted . " When it suits him ! " " He has no fear of sacrilege ? " " Was it sacrilege to cut down an old forest full of spiders and mulch ? I would n't know . Maybe the soothsayer can tell us . What do you say , Rabidus ? " The soothsayer was keeping to himself , riding a little ways off . He turned his hooded head toward the soldier and spoke in a hoarse , strained voice . " I know why the Roman has come here . " " What ? " The soldier was taken aback , but recovered with a grin . " Well , tell me then ! You 'll save us the trouble of torturing him to find out . Only joking ! Go on , soothsayer , speak up . " " He 's come to look for his son . " The strange voice emerging from the faceless hood chilled my blood . Wings fluttered in my chest . Involuntarily , I whispered the name of my son : " Meto !
