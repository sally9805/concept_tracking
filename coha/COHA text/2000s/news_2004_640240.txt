<p> Most people have not attended eight Shakespearean plays in their lives . Tony Church has performed in eight productions of ' The Merchant of Venice ' alone . <p> Church has been an actor for 62 of his 73 years . He was a founding member of the Royal Shakespeare Company , served as the first dean of the Denver Center Theatre Company 's National Theatre Conservatory and has performed in more than 70 Shakespearean productions in 13 countries . <p> Of the Bard 's 37 plays , it is easier to list the titles Church has not performed in , for there are only six : ' Pericles , ' ' All 's Well That Ends Well , ' ' Henry VIII ' and all three parts of ' Henry VI . ' And his voice can be heard on 26 Shakespearean recordings as well . <p> Around the globe , if people have heard of the DCTC , it 's likely because they have heard of Church . <p> He has played everyone from Malvolio to Prospero to Polonius , and no fewer than five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Doge of Venice in the DCTC 's new production of ' The Merchant of Venice ' opening Thursday , he will be revisiting the first play he ever performed , at the age of 11 in a school production in the west of England . <p> Two ' Merchants ' bookending 62 years : His has truly been a life on the stage . <p> ' It 's the greatest thing in the world to be privileged to be able to do what you love , and to have made a living at it , as I have done all my life , ' Church said . ' I 'm a theater actor , and I 've never been paid a lot , but the theater has kept me , and for that I shall be eternally grateful . ' <p> Church was born May 11 , 1930 , and schooled at Cambridge University . Classmates included Peter Hall and John Barton ( who collaborated on the DCTC 's ' Tantalus ' ) and Peter Weir ( ' Master and Commander ' ) . ' Well , that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' he joked . <p> Church was a founding member of England 's Royal Shakespeare Company in 1960 and remained affiliated with it for 28 years . He was given leave in 1967 to become the founding director of the Northcott Theatre in Exeter , and later headed the drama department of the Guildhall School in London . <p> Church has more theater anecdotes than most leading men have lines in a play . He played the Duke in the RSC 's 1960 production of ' The Merchant of Venice ' starring Peter O'Toole as Shylock . <p> ' It was O'Toole 's second professional job , ' Church said . ' On the night of the first preview , he came into the trial scene with his back to the audience and bowed to me . Now , as he bowed , he lifted up his dress to reveal to me that he had nothing on underneath . ' <p> Church said O'Toole made for an astonishing Shylock , ' but then he went off and did ' Lawrence of Arabia , ' and we never saw him again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for President Josip Tito of Yugoslavia in 1964 , and in 1968 was booed off a Broadway stage - for all the right reasons . <p> ' I played a bishop called George Bell in the Broadway production of Rolf Hochhuth 's ' Soldiers , " Church said . ' There was a **25;426;TOOLONG scene in which the Bishop was attacking Winston Churchill about the pattern bombing leading up to the bombing of Dresden . With my last line , I accused Churchill of being a traitor to his own people , and I was heckled all the way off the stage . ' <p> It was Denver Center for the Performing Arts founder Donald Seawell who first brought Church to Denver in 1975 . ' Otherwise , ' Church said , ' I would not have ever known about the place . ' <p> Seawell was a governor for the RSC and he booked its touring production of ' Love 's Labor 's Lost , ' including Church , into Denver 's old Bonfils Theatre . <p> ' The chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities called me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to America , ' Seawell said . ' He said the Endowment would underwrite the cost if the stars would also teach at a local educational institution during the run of the play . Naturally , I said yes , and brought over ' Love 's Labor 's Lost ' with Tony playing a starring role . ' <p> Church twice taught at the University of Denver , which since has given him an honorary doctorate . <p> ' When I was here in 1976 , Don had invited me to the offices of The Denver Post , and at the time , the ( Denver Center ) was just an idea in his head , ' Church said . <p> ' He showed me the model of what he wanted to do , and he said , ' This is going to be unlike any other performing-arts center in the United States , and I should think in England as well , because I am not only able to produce the money to build it from our foundations , but we are putting in escrow a sufficient sum of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big foundations had pulled out of supporting American regional theaters around 1968 , Don was determined that he would never have anything to do with a theater that depended on foundations he did n't control . ' <p> Church had no further contact with the Denver Center until 1988 , when artistic director Donovan Marley asked him to run the NTC student program and join the Denver Center 's acting company . <p> But Church was not immediately allowed to act in any Equity productions here , so he went to Mesa College in Grand Junction and performed in ' King Lear . ' <p> ' I was running the conservatory in Denver , but I did n't have resident alien status , so I could n't join a union , ' he said . <p> Church finally bowed at the DCTC in 1990 's ' The Man Who Came to Dinner . ' He considers his favorite roles there to be ' The Dresser ' ( 1996 ) , ' Taking Leave ' ( 1998 ) and ' The Tempest ' ( 1999 ) . <p> His favorite role remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lear is , so I 've still got more time to have another shot at him - and I wo n't have to wear any makeup . ' <p> If he had the opportunity to play the role again , he said , ' Now I would not be so concerned to play the autocratic king , because I think it plays itself . Also I think at my age and my authority , I do n't need to act that anymore . There are areas of the madness which interest me that I still do n't think I have explored enough , and the fact is , he 's an extraordinary mixture of hate and love . And while I think I 've done the hate very well , I think I probably would like to explore more of the love . ' <p> Shakespeare continues to appeal to Church because ' there is always a surprise every time we come back to a play , ' he said . ' Some bit of it comes up fresh that I have n't seen the same way before . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events always seem to make the story new again . <p> ' In Venice , the Jews were n't allowed to operate in any way other than lending money , and Jews were the only people allowed to charge interest because Christians believed earning interest to be a sin . <p> ' But Venice was also a business community that had no fidelity to anybody at the time the play was written . It was an empire of its own . Venice was sort of like the United States is now : You do n't move very far without American influence . Venice was the great commercial empire of the Elizabethan times . Well , that 's the United States . <p> ' What the rest of the world sincerely believes is that we went into Iraq to make certain that the oil was protected . Commercial considerations are driving this country more than any other , except possibly China , which is desperately trying to get there . ' <p> ' Merchant ' director Anthony Powell also directed Church in ' The Dresser , ' among others . <p> ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't tell you how much I 've learned from him , ' Powell said . ' And as if his talent and humanity were n't enough , his trove of backstage stories is phenomenal . ' <p> Church suffered a heart attack in 2001 but has had no health problems since , thanks to a pacemaker and defibrillator . He now lives most of the year in Greece after having remarried last year . His ex-wife , three children and two grandchildren live in England . But he would like to keep coming back to the DCTC , even after Marley resigns at the end of next season . <p> ' Obviously now everything is going to change , ' he said . ' I want to go on working here , and I want to make that absolutely plain . I think a lot of us do because we like working here .
