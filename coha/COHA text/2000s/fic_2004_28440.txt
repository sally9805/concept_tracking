Chapter One THE plane was heading down to a red dirt airstrip . Apart from the cluster of buildings that marked the sheep station of Gundamurra , there was no other habitation in sight between here and the horizon - a huge empty landscape dotted with scrubby trees . " Wish I had my camera , " Ric Donato murmured . Mitch Tyler frowned over the other boy 's words . Apparently the stark visual impact of the place did n't intimidate Ric . But then the guy had been copped joyriding in a stolen Porsche . He probably got off on wide-open spaces , while Mitch had always been happiest with a book in his hands . No local library here to tap into . " The middle of nowhere , " he muttered dispiritedly . " I 'm beginning to think I made the wrong choice . " " Nah , " Johnny Ellis drawled . " Anything 's better than being locked up . At least we can breathe out here . " " What ? Dust ? " Mitch mocked . The plane landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the great Australian Outback , " the cop escorting them said derisively . " And just remember ... if you three city smart-arses want to survive , there 's nowhere to run . " All three of them ignored him . They were sixteen . Regardless of what life threw at them , they were going to survive . And Johnny had it right , Mitch thought . Sixmonths working on a sheep station had to be better than a year in a juvenile jail . It was half the time , for a start , and there were only two other guys with him , not a horde of criminals who would have established a pecking order . Mitch hated bullies with a passion . He 'd learnt how to look after himself . No-one touched him anymore . But he sure did n't want to be incarcerated with a mob of power pushers . He hoped the owner of this place was n't some kind of little Hitler , exploiting the justice system to get a free labour force . Mitch decided he 'd work out for himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What had the judge said at the sentencing ? Something about getting back to ground values . A program that would teach them what real life was about . Would n't teach him a damned thing about real life , Mitch had thought at the time . He 'd majored in real life , ever since his father had walked out on his crippled wife , leaving him and his sister to look after their mother . The lion 's share of that had fallen to Jenny , who 'd only been eleven years old to his eight when their father had deserted them . Not that he 'd been much help anyway , getting drunk every night , drowning his sorrows instead of facing up to them . A coward . That was what his father had been . A contemptible coward . But not as contemptible as the guy who 'd date-raped Jenny . At least Mitch had had the satisfaction of facing that bastard with what he 'd done . There she 'd been , all excited about being invited to a swish party , finally getting into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a disposable piece of meat ... He was glad he 'd given that piece of slime a beating he 'd remember for a long time . It might be primitive justice , and against the law , but better than letting him get away with it , no justice at all . Jenny had been too traumatised to press charges against him . The silver-spoon heir to a fortune would probably have got off anyway , with his mega-wealthy family having the power and influence to get anything excused . Mitch felt no remorse over what he 'd done . None whatsoever . Though he was sorry he would n't be at home to help for the next six months . The plane taxied back to where a man - the owner ? - was waiting beside a four-wheel drive Land Rover . Big man - broad-shouldered , barrel-chested , craggy weathered face , iron-grey hair . Had to be over fifty but still looking tough and formidable . Not someone to buck in a hurry , Mitch decided , though size did n't automatically command his respect . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his unease with the situation . " No horse , " Johnny remarked with a grin . Mitch found himself smiling back . It looked like Johnny Ellis would provide some comic relief if life got grim here . He seemed to have the kind of affable nature that would avoid violence if it was avoidable , though even at sixteen his physique was big enough and strong enough to match anyone in a punch-up if forced into it . Johnny and Ric were street kids . No family . And no doubt they 'd worked out ways of looking after themselves . Mitch figured Johnny specialised in being everyone 's mate . He had friendly hazel eyes , a ready grin , and sun-streaked brown hair that tended to flop over his forehead . He 'd been caught dealing in marijuana , though he swore it was only to musicians who 'd get it from someone else anyway . Ric Donato was a very different kettle of fish . He had an intensity about him that could make him dangerous , Mitch thought . Was he a thief because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a very single-minded passion for the girl he 'd stolen the Porsche for , wanting to match up to her rich life . Mitch imagined that most girls would get a thrill out of Ric , just by being the focus of his attention . The guy had sex appeal in spades - mad , bad and dangerous , well-built without being hunky , and strikingly handsome in a very macho Italian way - black curly hair , almost black eyes , olive skin , and a face that Michelangelo might have carved for its masculine beauty . Perversely enough , the guy did n't seem to have tickets on himself at all . Like he 'd been hit too many times to believe he 'd been handed anything to feel good about . Mitch felt okay with himself . Angry at what had been dealt out to his family , but okay with the person he was . He did n't have Ric 's good looks but he was presentable enough - on the lean side but not a weakling , taller than most guys his age , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some girls . Mitch would prefer them to be more impressed by the smart brain that had got him labelled as a nerd before he took up boxing at the local boys ' club . He 'd never understood why using his intelligence earned scornful remarks from the jocks . Anyhow , he was n't called a nerd or a weed any more . He might not be liked but he 'd made damned sure he was respected . The plane came to a halt . The cop told them to get their duffle-bags from under the back seats . A few minutes later he was leading them out to a way of life which was far , far removed from anything the three of them had known before . ( Continues ... )
