Sasha wished that she would never have to see Boshen again after this trip . She ran to the bathroom the moment they entered the McDonald 's , leaving him to order for them both . He had suggested a good meal in Chinatown , and she had refused . She wanted to see downtown Chicago before going to the clinic at Planned Parenthood the next morning . It was the only reason for her to ride the Greyhound bus all day from Nebraska . Kansas City would have been a wiser choice , closer , cheaper , but there was nothing to see there-the trip was not meant for sightseeing , but Sasha hoped to get at least something out of it . She did not want to spend all her money only to remember a drugged sleep in a dreary motel in the middle of nowhere . Sasha had grown up in a small town in Inner Mongolia ; vast and empty landscapes depressed her . <p> " You must be tired , " Boshen said as he pushed the tray of food to Sasha , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked tiny in the oversized sweatshirt . Her face was slightly swollen , and the way she checked out the customers in the store , her eyes staying on each face a moment too long , moved him . She was twenty-one , a child still . <p> " I got a fish sandwich for you , " Boshen said when Sasha did not answer him . <p> " I have n't seen one happy face since arriving , " Sasha said . " What 's the other one ? " <p> " Chicken . " <p> Sasha threw the fish sandwich across the table and grabbed the chicken sandwich from Boshen 's tray . " I hate fish , " she said . <p> " It 's good for you now , " Boshen said . <p> " Now will be over soon , " Sasha said . She looked forward to the moment when she would be ready to move on . Moving on was a phrase she had just learned , an American concept that suited her well . It was such a wonderful phrase that Sasha could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after another , around the pages until they became one solid block that nobody would be able to open and read . She would have a fresh page then , for her American life . She was four months late already . <p> Boshen said nothing and unwrapped the fish sandwich . It was a change-sitting at a table and having an ordered meal-after months of eating in the kitchen of the Chinese restaurant where he worked as a helper to the Sichuan chef . Boshen had come to America via a false marriage to a friend five months earlier , when he had been put under house arrest for his correspondence with a western reporter regarding a potential AIDS epidemic in a central province . He had had to publish a written confession of his wrong-doing to earn his freedom . A lesbian friend , a newly naturalized American citizen herself , had offered to marry him out of China for his safety . Before that , he had lived an openly gay life in Beijing , madly in love with Yang , an eighteen-year-old boy . Boshen had tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , but the boy never responded . The checks Boshen sent him were not cashed , either . <p> They ate without speaking . Sasha swallowed her food fast and waited for Boshen to finish his . Outside the window , more and more people appeared , all moving towards the downtown , red reindeer 's antlers on the heads of children who sat astride on their fathers ' shoulders . Boshen saw the question in Sasha 's eyes , and told her that there was a parade that evening , and all the trees on Michigan Avenue would light up for the coming Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays . " Do you want to stay for it ? " he asked halfheartedly , hoping that she would choose instead to rest after the long bus ride . <p> " Why not ? " Sasha said , and put on her coat . <p> Boshen folded the sandwich wrapper like a freshly ironed napkin . " I wonder if we could talk for a few minutes here , " he said . <p> Sasha sighed . She had never liked Boshen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck her as the type of man who was as fussy as an old hen . She had not hesitated , however , to call him and ask for help when she had found out his number through an acquaintance . She had spoken in a dry , matter-of-fact way about her pregnancy that had gone too long for an abortion in the state of Nebraska . Yang had fathered the baby , she had told Boshen during their first phone call . She had had no intention of sparing Boshen the truth ; in a way , she felt Boshen was responsible for her misfortune , too . <p> " Have you , uh , made up your mind about the operation ? " Boshen asked . <p> " What do you think I 'm here for ? " Sasha said . Over the past week Boshen had called her twice , bringing up the possibility of keeping the baby . Both times she had hung up right away . Whatever interest he had in the baby was stupid and selfish , Sasha had decided . <p> The easiest solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of telling Sasha , but then , what right did he have to talk about options , when the decisions he had made for his life were all compromises ? At thirty-eight , Boshen felt he had achieved less than he had failed . He had been a mediocre doctor before he was asked politely to leave the hospital for establishing the first counseling hotline for homosexuals in the small Chinese city where he lived . He moved to Beijing and took on a part-time job at a private clinic while working as an activist for gay rights . After a few visits from the secret police , however , he realized that , in the post-Tiananmen era , talk of any kind of human rights was dangerous . He decided to go into a less extreme and more practical area , advocating for AIDS awareness , but even that he had to give up after pressure from the secret police and his family . He was in love with a boy twenty years younger , and he thought he could make a difference to the boy 's life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman and leave . Boshen had thought of adopting the baby-half of her blood came from Yang , after all-but Sasha 's eyes , sharp and unrelenting , chilled him . He smiled weakly and said , " I just wanted to make sure . " <p> Sasha wrapped her head in a shawl and stood up . Boshen did not move , and when she asked him if he was leaving , he said , " I 've heard from my friends that Yang is prostituting again . " <p> Not a surprise , Sasha thought , but the man at the table , too old for a role as a heartbroken lover and too serious for it , was pitiful . In a kinder voice she said , " Then we 'll have to live with that , no ? " <p> Boshen was not the first man to have fallen in love with Yang , but he believed , for a long time of seven , Yang had been trained as a Nan Dan-a male actor who plays female roles on stage in the Peking Opera-and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he was discovered going out with a male lover , he was expelled . Boshen had written several articles about the incident , but he had not met Yang until he had become a money boy . Yang could 've easily enticed a willing man to keep him for a good price , but rumors were that the boy was only interested in selling after his first lover had abandoned him . <p> The day Boshen heard about Yang 's falling into prostitution , he went to the park where men paid for such services . It was near dusk when he arrived , and men of all ages slipped into the park like silent fishes . Soon night fell ; beneath the lampposts , transactions started in whispers , familiar scenarios for Boshen , but standing in the shade of a tree-a customer instead of researcher-made him tremble . It was not difficult to recognize Yang in the moon-white colored silk shirt and pants he was reputed to wear every day to the park . Boshen watched the boy , too beautiful for the grimy underground , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After watching the boy for several days , Boshen finally offered to pay Yang 's asking price . The night Yang came home with him , Boshen became drunk on his own words . For a long time he talked about his work , his dream of bringing an end to injustice and building a more tolerant world ; Yang huddled on the couch and listened . Boshen thought of shutting up , but the more he talked , the more he despaired at the beautiful and impassive face of Yang-in the boy 's eyes he must have been the same as all the other men , so full of themselves . Finally , Boshen said , " Someday I 'll make you go back to the stage . " <p> " An empty promise of a man keeps a woman 's heart full , " Yang recited in a low voice . <p> " But this , " Boshen said , pointing to the pile of paperwork on his desk . " This is the work that will make it illegal for them to take you away from the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face softened . Boshen watched the unmistakable hope in the boy 's eyes . Yang was too young to hide his pain , despite years of wearing female masks and portraying other women 's pains onstage , and Boshen wanted to save him from his suffering . After a few weeks of pursuing , Boshen convinced Yang to try a new life . Boshen redecorated the apartment with expensive , hand-painted curtains that featured the costumes of the Peking Opera and huge paper lanterns bearing the Peking Opera masks . He sold a few pieces of furniture to make space and borrowed a rug from a friend for Yang to practice on . Yang fit into the quiet life like the most virtuous woman he had played onstage . He got up early every morning , stretching his body into unbelievable positions and dancing the most intricate choreography . He trained his voice , too , in the shower so that the neighbors would not hear him . Always Boshen stood outside and listened , Yang 's voice splitting the waterfall , the bath curtain , the door , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At those moments , Boshen was overwhelmed by gratitude-he was not the only one to have been touched by the boy 's beauty , but he was the one to guard and nurture it . That alone lifted him above his mundane , disappointing life . <p> When Boshen was at work , Yang practiced painting and calligraphy-they had been taught to him in the Opera School . Sometimes they went out to parties , but most evenings they stayed home , quiet and uneventful . Yang never performed for Boshen , and he dared not ask him to . Yang was an angel falling out of the heaven , and every day Boshen dreaded that he would not be able to return the boy to where he belonged . <p> Such a fear , as it turned out , was not unreasonable . Two months into the relationship , Yang started to show signs of restlessness . During the day he went out more than before , and he totally abandoned painting and calligraphy . Boshen wondered if the boy was suffocated by the stillness of their life . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put under house arrest in his hometown , Yang asked him casually how his work was going . Fine , Boshen said , feeling uneasy . Yang had never asked him anything about his work ; it was part of the ugly world that Boshen had wanted to shelter Yang from . <p> " What are you working on ? " Yang asked . <p> " Why , the usual stuff , " Boshen said . <p> " I heard you were working on AIDS , " Yang said . " What has that to do with you ? " <p> Stunned , Boshen tried to find an explanation . Finally , he said , " You do n't understand , Yang . " <p> " I 'm not a child , " Yang said . " Why are you concerned with that dirty disease ? The more you work on it , the more people will connect it with gay people . What good does it do for us ? " <p> " I 'm trying to help more people than the two of us , " Boshen said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the stage , " Yang said . " If you insist on working on something irrelevant , you 'll never fulfill your promise . " <p> Boshen could not answer Yang . Afterwards , Yang started to go out more often , and a few days later , he did not come home for the first time in their relationship . Boshen thought of all the predators waiting to pounce on Yang , and he did not sleep for the night . <p> " There 's nothing for you to worry about , " Yang said with a strange smile when Boshen confronted him . " I 'm not as endangered as you imagine . " <p> " At least you should 've let me know where you were , " Boshen said . <p> " I was with a girl , " Yang said , and mentioned a name , Sasha , that sounded slightly familiar to Boshen . They had met her at a party , Yang reminded Boshen , but he did not remember who she was ; he did not understand why Yang was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly question , " Yang said . " You do things when you feel like it , no ? " <p> The first time Sasha met Yang at a party , she felt that she was looking into a mirror that reflected not her own face , but that of someone she could never become . She watched the ballet of his long fingers across the table while he listened absentmindedly to the conversation of others around the table . She looked at the innocent half moons on his fingernails ; her own fingers were plump and blunt . His cream-colored face , his delicate nose and mouth reminded her of an exquisite china doll . Later , when they sat closer , she saw the melancholy in his eyes , and decided that he was more like a statue of Kuanyin , the male Buddha in a female body , the goddess who listened and responded to the prayers of suffering women and children . In front of him , Sasha felt like a mass-produced rubber doll . <p> The uneasy feeling lasted only for a moment . Sasha had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him finally in person . She leaned toward him and asked , as if picking up from a conversation they had dropped somewhere , " What do you think of girls , then ? " <p> He looked up at her , and she saw a strange light in his eyes . They reminded her of a wounded sparrow she had once kept during a cold Mongolian winter . Sparrows were an obstinate species that would never eat or drink once they were caged , her mother told her . Sasha did not believe it . She locked the bird for days , and it kept bumping into the cage until its head started to go bald . Still she refused to release it , mesmerized by its eyes , wild but helplessly tender , too . She nudged the little bowl of soaked millet closer to the sparrow , but the bird was blind to her hospitality . Cheap birds , a neighbor told her ; only cheap birds would be so stubborn . Have a canary , the neighbor said , and she would be singing for you every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Sasha 's scrutiny , and she felt the urge to chase the beautiful eyes , a huntress of that strange light . " You must have known some girls , no ? " she said . " When you went to the Opera School , were there girls in the school ? " <p> " Yes , " the boy said , his voice reminding her of a satin dress . <p> " So ? " <p> " We did n't talk . They played handmaids and nannies , background roles . " <p> " So you were the princess , huh ? " Sasha laughed , and saw the boy blush , with anger perhaps , but it made her more curious and insistent in cornering him . " What 's your name ? " she said . <p> " Which name ? " <p> " How many names do you have ? " <p> " Two . One given by my parents . One given by the Opera School . " <p> " What are they ? " <p> He dipped one finger into a glass of orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed the wet trace of his finger . It was Yang , a common boy 's name with the character for the sun , the masculine principle of nature , the opposite of Yin . <p> " A so-so name . What 's your Opera name ? " <p> " Sumeng , " he said . A serene and pure dreamer , it meant . <p> " Worse . Sounds like a weepy name from a romance novel , " Sasha said . " You need a better name . I 'll have to think of one for you . " <p> In the end , she did not use either name , and did not find a better one for him . She called him my little Nan Dan , and that was what he was to her , a boy destined to play a woman 's part . She paged him often , and invited him to movies and walks in the park . She made decisions for them both , and he let her . She tried to pry him open with questions-she was so curious about hinv-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had loved and men who loved him . He never said anything about the Opera School or his stage life , and she learned not to push him . He was so vain , Sasha thought , when he spent a long time fixing his hair or when he put on an expression of aloofness at the slightest attention of a stranger ; she teased him , and then felt tender and guilty when he did not defend himself . She made fun of the other people in Yang 's life , too , his lover , Boshen , whom she believed to be a useless dreamer , and the men who boldly asked him for his number . She believed she was the first person in his life who did not worship him in any way , and he must have followed her around because ofthat . It pleased her . <p> Was she dating the boy ? Sasha 's classmates asked when they saw her with Yang more than once . Of course not , she said . In a month , Sasha was to go to America for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship now . Besides , how smart was it to date a boy who loved no one but himself ? <p> Even the wind could not cut through the warm bodies lined up on both sides of Michigan Avenue . Sasha pushed through the crowd . They looked so young and carefree , these Americans , happy as a group of pupils on a field trip . She envied these people who would stand in a long line in front of a popcorn shop waiting for a bag of fresh popcorn , lovers leaning into each other , children hanging on to their parents . They were born to be themselves , nave and contented with their naivety . <p> " I would trade my place with any one of them , " Sasha said to Boshen , but when he raised his voice and asked her to repeat her words , she shook her head . If only there were a law in America binding her to where her baby belonged , so that the baby would have a reason to live ! <p> Sasha herself had once been used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the thousands of high school students sent down from Beijing to Inner Mongolia for labor reeducation , her mother , in order to join the Party , married a Mongolian herdsman , one of the model interracial marriages that were broadcast across the grassland . Five years later , at the end of the Cultural Revolution , all of the students were allowed to return to Beijing . Sasha 's mother , however , was forced to stay , even after she divorced her Mongolian husband . Their two daughters , born in the grassland , did not have legal residency in Beijing , and the mother had to stay where the children belonged . <p> Sasha pushed forward , looking at every store window . Silky scarves curved around the mannequins ' necks with soft obedience . Diamonds glistened on dark velvet . At a street corner , children gathered and watched the animated story displayed in the windows of Marshall Field 's . If only her baby were a visa that would admit her into this prosperity , Sasha thought , saddened by the memories of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places black with lonely , lifeless stars . <p> " There 's an open spot there , " Boshen said . " Do you want to stand there ? " <p> Sasha nodded , and Boshen followed her . Apart from the brief encounter at the party in Beijing and a few phone calls , he did not know her . He had thought about her often after she had called him about the pregnancy . What kind of girl , he had wondered , would 've made Yang a father ? He had imagined a mature and understanding girl . Beautiful , too . He had made up a perfect woman for Yang and for his own peace of mind , but Sasha had disappointed him . When they settled along the curb , he said , " So , what 's your plan after the operation ? " <p> Sasha stood on tiptoes like a child and looked in the direction where the parade would start . Boshen regretted right away speaking with such animosity. seeing nothing , she turned to him and said , " What 's your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway ? " <p> Boshen frowned . He had told Yang that the marriage would be used as a cover , and his departure was only meant to be a temporary one . He had promised Yang other things , too , money he would send , help he would seek in the overseas Chinese community for Yang 's return to the stage . Not a day since he had arrived did he forget his promises , but Sasha 's words stung him . His marriage must have been an unforgivable betrayal , in Sasha 's and Yang 's eyes alike . " I ca n't defend myself , " Boshen said finally . <p> " Of course not . You were the one sending him back to the street , " Sasha said . <p> " It 's been a troubled time , " Boshen said , struggling over the words . " It 's been difficult for all of us . But we certainly should try to help him out . " <p> Sasha turned to look at Boshen with an amused smile . " You speak like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Show me the solution . " <p> " I am thinking , " Boshen said , then paused . " I 've been thinking-if we can tell him that he 'll be able to perform in America , maybe he would want to leave Beijing ? " <p> " And then ? " <p> " We will try here . There 's a Nan Dan master in New York . Maybe we can contact him and ask for his help . But the first thing we do is to get Yang out of the country . " <p> " Does that we include me ? " <p> " If you could marry Yang , he would be here in no time . I know him . If there 's one percent chance to go back to stage , he 'll try . " <p> " A very nice plan , Boshen , " Sasha said . " But why should I agree to the proposal ? What 's in it for me ? " <p> Boshen looked away from Sasha and watched a couple kiss at the other side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sasha and tried to look into her eyes . " You must have loved him at least once , Sasha , " he said , his voice trembling . <p> Sasha had not planned for love , or even an affair . The friendship was out of whimsy , a convenience for the empty days immediately before graduating from college . The movie they watched one night in July was not planned , either . It was ten o'clock when Sasha purchased the tickets , at the last minute . Yang looked at the clock in the ticket booth and wondered aloud if it was too late , and Sasha laughed , asking him if he was a child , and if his lover had a curfew for him . <p> The movie was Pretty Woman , with almost unreadable Chinese subtitles . When they came out to the midnight street , Sasha said , " Do n't you love Julie Roberts ? " <p> " What 's to love about her ? " Yang said . <p> Sasha glanced at Yang . He had been quiet throughout the movie-he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could 've enjoyed the beautiful actress . " She 's pretty , and funny , and so-American , " Sasha said . " America is a good place . Everything could happen there . A prostitute becomes a princess ; a crow turns into a swan overnight . " <p> " A prostitute never becomes a princess , " Yang said . <p> " How do you know ? " Sasha said . " If only you could come with me to America and take a look at it yourself . " <p> After a long moment , Yang said , " Every place is a good place . Only time goes wrong . " <p> Sasha said nothing . She did not want to spend the night philosophizing . When they walked past a small hotel , she asked Yang if he wanted to come in with her . Just for the fun of staying out for a night , she said ; he need n't have to report to his lover , anyway , she added . Yang hesitated , and she grabbed his hand and pulled him into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reception opened the window and said , " What do you want ? " <p> " Comrade , do you have a single room for two persons ? " Sasha said . <p> The woman threw out a pad for registration and shut the window . Sasha filled in the form . The woman scanned the pad . " Your ID ? " she asked . <p> Sasha handed her ID to the woman . The woman looked at it for a long time , and pointed to Yang with her chin . " His ID ? " <p> " He 's my cousin from Inner Mongolia , " Sasha said in a cheerful voice . " He forgot to bring his ID with him . " <p> " Then there 's no room tonight . " The woman threw out Sasha 's ID and closed the window . <p> " Comrade . " Sasha tapped on the glass . <p> The woman opened the window and said , " Go away . Your cousin ? Let me tell you-either you have a marriage license and I will give you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing in the street , and let the cops arrest you . Do n't you think I do n't know girls like you . " <p> Sasha dragged Yang out of the door , his lips quavering . " I do n't believe I ca n't find a room for us , " Sasha said finally . <p> Yang looked at Sasha , baffled . " Why do we have to do this ? " he said . <p> " Ha , you 're afraid now . Go ahead if you do n't want to come , " Sasha said , and started to walk . Yang followed Sasha to an even smaller hotel at the end of a narrow lane . An old man was sitting behind a desk , playing poker with himself . " Grandpapa , " Sasha said , handing her ID to the old man . " Do you have a single room for my brother and me ? " <p> The old man looked at Sasha and then Yang . " He 's not fifteen yet so he does n't have an ID , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , his white teeth flashing in the dark . <p> The old man nodded and handed a registration pad to Sasha . Five minutes later they were granted a key . It was a small room on the second floor , with two single beds , a rusty stand with two basins , and a window that did not have a curtain . Roaches scurried to find a hiding place when Sasha turned on the light . They stood just inside the door , and all of a sudden , she did not know what the excitement was of spending a night together in a filthy hotel . " Why do n't we just go home ? " Yang said behind her . <p> " Where 's the place you call home ? " Sasha snapped . She turned off the light and lay down on a bed without undressing . " Go back to the man who keeps you if this is not a place for a princess like you , " she said . <p> Yang stood for a long moment before he got into the other bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not , she became angry with him , and with herself . <p> The next morning , when the city stirred to life , they both lay awake in their own beds without talking . The homing pigeons flew across the sky , the small brass whistles bound to their tails humming in a harmonious , low tone . Not far away , Tao music played on a tape recorder , calling for the early risers to join the practice of tai chi . Old men , the fans of Peking Opera , sang their favorite parts of the Opera , their voices cracking at high notes . Then the doors down the lane creaked open , releasing the shouting children headed to school and adults to work , their bicycle bells clanking noisily . <p> Later , someone turned on a record player , and music blasted across the alley . Sasha sat up and looked out of the window . A young man was setting up a newspaper stand at the end of the alley , making theatrical movements along with a song in which a rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Genghis Khan , he is a powerful old man . He is rich , he is strong , and I want to marry him . " <p> Sasha listened to the song repeat and said , " I do n't understand why these people think they have the right to trash Genghis Khan . " <p> " Their ears are dead to real music , " Yang said . <p> " When I was little , my father taught me a song about Genghis Khan . It was the only Mongolian song I remember now , " Sasha said , and opened her mouth to sing the song . The melody was in her mind , but no words came to her tongue . She had forgotten almost all of the Mongolian words she had learned after her parents ' divorce ; she had not seen her father for fifteen years . " Well , I do n't remember it anymore . " <p> " The broken pillars , the slanted roof , " Yang chanted in a low voice , " they once saw the banqueting days ; the dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavenly music . The young girls dreamed of their lovers who were enlisted to fight the Huns . They did not know the loved ones had become white bones glistening in the moonlight . " Yang stared at the ceiling . " Our masters say that real arts never die . Real arts are about remembrance . " <p> " What 's the point of remembering the song , anyway ? " Sasha asked . " I do n't even remember what my father looked like . " She thought about her father , one of the offspring of Genghis Khan . Genghis Khan was turned into a clown in the pop song . Mongolia was once the biggest empire in the world , and now it was a piece of meat , sandwiched by China and Russia . <p> " We live in a wrong time , " Yang said . <p> Sasha turned to look at Yang . He lay on his hands and stared at the ceiling , his face taking on the resigned look of an old man . It hurt her , and scared her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty . " We were born into a wrong place is what our problem is , " she said , trying to cheer him and herself up . " Why do n't you come to America with me , Yang ? " <p> Yang smiled . " Who am I to follow you ? " <p> " A husband , a lover , a brother , I do n't care . Why do n't you get out of Beijing and have a new life in America ? " The words , once said , hung in the room like heavy fog , and Sasha wondered if Yang , too , had difficulty breathing . Outside the window , a vendor was sharpening a chopper with a whetstone , the strange sound making their mouths water unpleasantly . Then the vendor started to sing in a drawn-out voice about his tasty pig heads . <p> " Sasha , " Yang said finally . " Is Sasha a Mongolian name ? " <p> " Not really . It 's Russian , a name of my mom 's favorite heroine in a Soviet war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sound Chinese . I would rather it is a Mongolian name , " Yang said . " Sasha , the princess of Mongolia . " <p> Sasha walked barefoot to Yang 's bed and knelt beside him . He did not move and let Sasha hold his face with both hands . " Come to America with me , " she said . " We 'll be the prince and the princess of Nebraska . " <p> " I was not trained to play a prince , " Yang said . <p> " The script is changed , " Sasha said . " From today on . " <p> Yang turned to look at Sasha . She tried to kiss him , but he pushed her away gently . " A beautiful body is only a bag of bones , " he sang in a low voice . <p> Sasha had never seen Yang perform , and could not imagine him onstage ; he had played princesses and prostitutes , but he did not have to live with the painted mask and the silk costume . " The Peking Opera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you give it up ? " <p> " Who are you to say that about the Peking Opera ? " Yang said . <p> Sasha saw the sudden iciness in Yang 's eyes , and let the topic drop . Afterwards , neither mentioned anything about the stay in the hotel . A week later , when Boshen was escorted away from Beijing , Sasha was relieved and scared . There was , all of a sudden , time for them to fill . To her relief and disappointment , Yang seemed to have forgotten the moment when they were close , so close that they were almost in love . <p> The parade started with music and laughter , colorful floats moving by on which happy people waved to the happy audience . Boshen looked at Sasha 's face lit up by curiosity , and sighed . Despite her willfulness and unfriendliness , the thought of the baby-Yang 's baby-made him eager to forgive her . " Do you still not want to tell Yang about the baby ? " he said . <p> " You 've asked this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should I ? " <p> " He might want to come to America if he learned about the baby , " Boshen said . <p> " There 's no baby after tomorrow , " Sasha said . She had tried Yang 's phone number when she had learned of the pregnancy ; she had tried his pager , too . At first it was measured by hours and days , and then it became weeks since she had left the message on his pager . He might have been living in another apartment with a new telephone number . The pager might no longer have belonged to him . She knew he had every reason for not getting her message , but she could not forgive his silence . In the meantime , her body changed . She felt the growth inside her , and she was disgusted by it . Sometimes she hated it from morning till night , hoping that it would finally go away somehow , surrendering to the strength of her resentment . Other times she kept her mind away for as long as she could , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed . Still , in the end , it required her action . In the end , it was just a chunk of flesh , and blood . <p> " But why was there a baby in the first place ? " Boshen said . Why and how it happened were the questions that had been haunting him since he had heard from Sasha . He wanted to ask her if she , too , had been dazzled by the boy 's body , smooth , lithe , perfectly shaped . He wanted to know if she had loved him as he had , but in that case , how could she have the heart to discard what had been left with her ? <p> Sasha turned to Boshen . For the first time , she studied the man with curiosity . Not handsome nor ugly , he had a candid face that Sasha thought she could not fall in love with but nonetheless could trust . A man like Boshen should have had an ordinary life , boring and comfortable , yet his craze for Yang made him a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been what was Yang 's value-he made people fall in love with him , and the love led them astray , willingly , from their otherwise tedious paths . Yang had been the one to bring up the idea of spending a night together again , and Sasha the one to ask a friend for the use of her rented room , a few days before Sasha 's flight . It was one of the soggiest summer evenings . After their lovemaking , sweet and short and uneventful , they stayed on the floor , on top of the blanket Sasha had brought for the purpose , an arm 's length in between them , each too warm to touch the other . Outside , the landlady 's family and two other neighbor families were sitting in the courtyard and watching a TV program , their voices mixed with the claps of their hands killing the mosquitoes . Sasha turned to look at Yang , who was lying with his back to her . The little pack of condoms she had bought was tucked underneath the blanket , unopened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A rubber was for people who touched without loving each other , Yang had said ; his words had made her hopeful . " Do you want to come to America with me now ? " she asked , tracing his back with one finger . <p> " What am I going to do in America ? Be kept as a canary by you ? " Yang said and moved farther away from her finger . <p> " You can spend some time learning English , and get a useful degree in America . " <p> " Useful ? Do n't you already know that I am useless ? Besides , nothing humiliates a man more than living as a parasite on his woman , " Yang said , and reached for a silk robe he had packed with him . Before Sasha had the time to stop him , he walked out of the door . Sasha jumped to her feet and watched from behind the curtain ; Yang walked with a calculated laziness , not looking at the people who turned their eyes away from the television to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of the courtyard , he sat on the edge and raised his bare legs to the tap . The water had run for a long moment before the landlady recovered from her shock and said , " Hey , the water costs me money . " <p> Yang smiled . " It 's so hot , " he said in a pleasant voice . <p> " Indeed , " the landlady agreed . <p> Yang turned off the tap and walked back to the room with the same grace and idleness , knowing that the people in the courtyard were all watching him , his willowy body wrapped in the moon-white robe . Sasha stood by the window , cold with disappointment . She became his audience , one of the most difficult to capture , perhaps , but he succeeded after all . <p> A Disney float approached the corner where Sasha and Boshen stood . " Look , " Sasha said and pointed at a giant glove of Mickey Mouse moving ahead of the float . " There 're only four fingers . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Yang needs us no more than that glove needs us for our admiration , " Sasha said . <p> " But our love is the only thing to protect him , and to save him , too . " <p> Sasha turned and looked into Boshen 's eyes . " It 's people like us who have destroyed him , is n't it ? Why was there Nan Dan in the Peking Opera in the first place ? Men loved him because he was playing a woman ; women loved him because he was a man playing , " she said . <p> " That 's totally wrong . " <p> " Why else do you want so much to put him back to the stage ? Do n't think I 'm happy to see him fall . Believe me , I wanted to help him as much as you do . He did n't have to be a man playing a woman-I thought I would make him understand . But what did I end up with ? You 're not the one who has a baby inside ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sasha said , and started to cry . <p> Boshen held out his hand hesitantly , touching Sasha 's shoulder . If only she could love Yang one more time , Boshen thought . Yang could choose to live with either of them ; he could choose not to love them at all , but their love would keep him safe and intact ; they could-the three of them-bring up the baby together . Yang would remain the princess , exiled , yes , but a true princess , beautiful in a foreign land . If only he knew how to make Sasha love Yang again , Boshen thought . <p> Sasha did not move away when Boshen put an arm around her shoulder . They must look like the most ordinary couple to the strangers , she thought . A nervous husband comforting his moody wife after an argument . They might as well be a couple , out of love , he caring only for the baby inside her , she having no feeling left for anything , her unborn child included . <p> As if in responding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , gentle and tentative , the first greeting that Sasha had wished she would never have to answer , but it seemed impossible , once it happened , not to hope for more . Sasha held her breath and waited . After a long moment , people in the street shouted , and children screamed out of excitement . Sasha looked up-the lights were lit up in the trees , thousands of stars forming a constellation . She thought about the small Mongolian town where her mother lived alone now , her long shadow trailing behind her as she walked home along the dimly lit alley . Her mother had been born into a wrong time . Lived all her adult life in a wrong place . Yet she had never regretted the births of her two daughters . Sasha held her breath and waited for more of the baby 's messages . America was a good country , she told herself , a right place to be born into . Everything was possible in America , and she imagined a baby possessing the beauty of her father but happier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby moved again , she burst into tears . Being a mother must be the saddest yet most hopeful thing in the world , she thought-falling into a love that , once started , would never end . <p>
