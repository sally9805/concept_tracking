Chapter One " Forty-one , Patricia . I ca n't believe it at all . Look at you . You 've been sealed up in some kind of cryogenic storage . In West Cork , the women have no teeth of their own by forty-one , they have chin whiskers , their dugs are down to their waists , they 've dried up completely , " he said . " When I thought to look up me fancy New York cousin , I never thought I 'd be gattlin ' after you . I thought you 'd remind me of me mam , or me granny , or Sister Margaret from school . She was a terror , that one . " These remarks , uttered on our third or fourth night together , might have offended me had they not been murmured by Mickey as he lay sprawled in my bed , idly tracing a line down my bare hip with one intoxicating fingertip . I had been in cold storage , until Mickey . How can I explain what it is about him ? How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primitive at times that I am almost afraid of it-it , my desire for him , my obsession . Mickey has changed me . Everything has been rearranged . Years ago I saw a television documentary about heart transplants that fascinated me . The donor heart , which has been kept on ice , is warmed up and placed inside the chest where the diseased heart had been moments before . After hours of surgery , the moment of truth comes when the clamps are removed and blood flows into this new heart , which has been chilled and still for several hours . Warmed by the circulating blood , the heart slowly begins to do what a heart is meant to do-it starts to beat again . * * * Now with the deepest evening darkness of late December pressing against the windows , we lay twined together like satiated kittens . I eyed him and put my head back down on the bony indentation below his sternum . " What do you mean , pick one out ? One what ? A painting ? " I listened to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one over there , " I said languidly , pointing to the framed poster from the Matisse in Morocco show that hangs on my bedroom wall . " It 's very blue that painting . Very Moroccan . Very Matisse . " I was n't really paying attention yet . " What I mean is , on a purely theoretical basis , If I showed you a group of paintings , would you automatically know which one was best ? " " Oh Mickey , of course , sure . You bet . The Patricia Dolan prize for excellence is awarded to ... this one . " I reached up and pressed my fingertips to his philtrum , which is perfectly formed , like that of a Raphael angel . His lips parted a little , and I slid my index finger down and slipped it between them . We were like children , always touching , always playing . He welcomed my finger with a brief touch from the tip of his tongue , just for an instant , but then he pushed my hand and turned his head away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked in a measured voice , very slowly and deliberately , keeping all of his consonants rounded up instead of letting them blur at the edges , " very seriously , Patricia , given your expertise in Dutch paintings of the seventeenth century , that you could pick out the best Vermeer from a group of paintings that are all by Vermeer ? " * * * Sometimes I study her for so long that I need to get away from that room , and I go for a walk along the cow path that passes by the cottage and goes around the hem of the cove and up the opposite side . At the edge of a field where the cow path doubles back , I like to climb through a barbed-wire fence that 's there to keep cows in , not the likes of me out , and then I walk across a series of crooked ancient fields toward the sea , all the way to the rock at the top of the cliff-I 'm not sure which-is called Ardnageeha , which means " height of the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not afraid of the wind . Think of those skies filling the canvas ; think of those towering dark clouds , those windlashed trees . At Ardnageeha , I imagine Jacob van Ruisdael beside me , working with his characteristic probity , painting the winds portrait . ( Continues ... )
