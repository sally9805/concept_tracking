IT 'S A SUNDAY AFTERNOON in early May . Bud McMahon , who 's eighty-one and dying of esophageal cancer , has been to church with his wife , Annie . Friday they went to the clinic , where they were given the diagnosis . Tomorrow they have an appointment with a surgeon , but they 've been warned there is probably nothing the surgeon can do . Now McMahon 's sitting in the living room with his son , Web . Annie 's in the bedroom resting . But McMahon knows it 's not just that . She wants McMahon and Web to talk , just the two of them . She hopes that now , at last , they 'll learn to get along . <p> McMahon has always had problems with Web . He 's never been the strong , stoic son McMahon wanted . He 's smart ; he teaches painting and art history at the university . When he was young , he wanted to be a real painter . And maybe he could 've been , maybe he had the talent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Web 's cynical about it now . About what little painting he still does , about the students he teaches . And he 's been married for nearly twenty years to a successful woman , Ellen , who despises McMahon . They 've chosen-Web and Ellen-not to have children . They had their careers ; Ellen 's a psychologist , some kind of therapist or counselor , and neither of them wanted to sacrifice that for children . Careers . They did n't talk about their work . They talked about their careers . <p> McMahon knows that Web 's here now because he wants to get things said before it 's too late . Web 's had a breakdown . He had an affair with a student . ( One of many , probably , McMahon thinks : Web 's always been attractive to women young enough and dumb enough to mistake his weakness for wisdom-or at least sophistication . ) Ellen , who had probably been looking for an excuse for some time , ordered him out of the house . Web then drank and drifted his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roulette by himself in the middle of the night . ( Or so Web had said . McMahon doubted there 'd been bullets in the gun . The empty-gun suicide attempt , that would be Web . All self-pity , no risk . ) He took sick leave from the university . He was just out now , after spending a month in a high-dollar moon ward called Harbor View . McMahon knows what kind of advice he would 've gotten there : Go to the root of the problem , talk things through with your father . Using the kinds of words McMahon had heard Ellen use . Closure , that was the one he hated most . Well , if that 's what he wanted now , all he had to do was wait a few months and McMahon would be dead . Real fucking closure . But Web 's not the kind to let it go at that . He 'll have to pick at the sores . And on account of Annie , McMahon will have to let him do it . It irritates McMahon . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time ago . Why should they kid themselves about that now , either of them , just because McMahon is dying ? <p> Just now , Web looks like he might get up out of his easy chair and leave . He does n't know what to say , how to start . McMahon can see that . He gives Web a little more time , then says , " The Braves are on the TV , I think . You want to watch ? " <p> Web perks up , as if that were the cue he 's been waiting for . " I 'm thinking about making it up with Ellen , " he says . " I think she 'll take me back . " <p> Well , Christ , of course . It 's the way of the weak , always going back to the suffering they 're used to . " You want that ? " <p> " I think so . " <p> What can McMahon say to that ? It was a terrible marriage , Web 's and Ellen 's . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with something or other all the time . She 'd get so bad she could n't breathe . But the doctors never could find out what it was . They said it was psychosomatic . McMahon thought she was allergic to Web . She 'd be better off without Web . If she stayed away from him , she 'd probably never cough again . And , God knows , Web would be better off without her . Even Annie agreed with that - and she thought divorce was a sin . <p> " I do n't know , " McMahon says . " Are you telling me that 's what you want to do ? Or are you wanting my advice ? " <p> " Your advice , I guess . You and Mother , you 're as different from each other as Ellen and I are . " <p> McMahon can hear Annie moving around in the kitchen . " That 's right . Your mother and me , " he says , " we were as different as daylight and dark . I drank and cussed and roared around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navy . I thought I would be , but I was n't . I was hard to be around . You know that . But your mother , she waited it out . She stuck by me . It was part duty that kept her by me . Religion . Fear of God . But I do n't think even that would 've been enough . So it was love too . She 's always loved me . I do n't know why . I did n't deserve it . But that 's what it was . " <p> Web looks at him . He seems a little confused . " What are you saying then ? You think we should stick it out too ? Ellen and me ? That it 's our duty ? " <p> " I do n't know , son . I never liked Ellen . You know that . Just then , I was trying to tell you to go back to her . But that 's just because I thought that 's what you wanted me to tell you . But I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , you and her . " <p> " I could change . That could change . " <p> There it is , a thing that has always bothered McMahon about his son . The way he has of seeing weakness as duty . He says , " You asked me , I 'll tell you . Sometimes a man 's better off with a stump-broke goat than he is with a woman . " <p> By the time Annie wakes up and finds her way into the TV room , Web 's gone and McMahon is watching the Braves . Annie stands in the doorway and leans over her walker . She 's looking around the room as if Web might be hiding somewhere . " What happened ? " she says . <p> " He 's thinking about going back to Ellen . " McMahon speaks loudly , slowly , and clearly . Even with her hearing aids , she 's almost deaf . " He 's gone . " <p> " What did you tell him ? " <p> " I told him not to . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stands there for a long moment and stares at him . She 's trying not to say what she wants to say . McMahon can see that . She 's always blamed him for the troubles they 've had with Web . And she wants to blame him now , for this . But she does n't . She wo n't . It 's one of the things about dying ; people stop telling you what they think . They start trying to protect you from life . <p> " He just wants to know you love him , " she says . " That 's all . " " I 've loved him since the day he was born . I love him now . I 'll love him till I die . If he does n't understand that , fuck him . " McMahon believes that 's true : He loves his son , he just does n't like him . Can hardly tolerate him . <p> " May God forgive you . " <p> She steps back out of the doorway , pulls her walker to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turns into it , and lurches , precariously , angrily , away from him . <p> McMahon turns his attention back to the TV . Maddux is pitching against the Mets . This is what McMahon wants to do now , watch someone do a hard thing as well as it can be done . Someone who has to work with a very small margin of error doing something that , in any real sense , makes no difference whatsoever . <p> He tries to concentrate on the game , tries as if he were the catcher , Bako , to call the pitches and the location before they 're thrown . He 's good at this . He knows the game . But today his mind wo n't be diverted . It returns to Web . He 'll be back , sooner or later , McMahon tells himself . His father is dying . Guilt will drive him back . <p> Guilt . You get down to it , he thinks , maybe that 's all that holds us together , all that makes us a family . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that your love has n't been strong or pure enough . <p> " There 's nothing I can do , " the surgeon says . He 's a man in his fifties with a strong round face . His hair is gray , and he has a thick mustache that still has some red in it . His eyes are a clear blue , and McMahon likes the honest way they hold his gaze . This is not one of those doctors who looks down at his charts when he has something hard to say . This surgeon is a man he can trust . <p> " I want you to cut it out , " McMahon says . " Or try to , anyway . If it do n't work , I 'll die on the table . Clean . " <p> " Mr. McMahon ... " <p> " Only problem I got now is I ca n't eat . Food wo n't go down , just lumps up and comes back . All I expect you to do is go in there and clear a path . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glances at Annie , who was in her youth the most beautiful woman he 'd ever seen . Now she 's old and confused . He 's sure she has n't heard anything that 's been said . " It 's the only pleasure I got left . " <p> The surgeon , still looking straight at him , opens his hands , a gesture of helplessness . " Mr. McMahon , " he says . " I 'm a surgeon . It 's my nature to be direct . You understand that ? " <p> " It 's why I 'm talking to you . " <p> " Yes sir . I see that . So what I 'm telling you is that with this kind of cancer-esophageal cancer-by the time we find it , most of the time it 's too late to operate . I 'd go in . I 'd find that it 's spread . I 'd close it up . And you 'd be way worse off than you were when I started . You 'd suffer more and die sooner . " <p> McMahon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What did he say ? " she asks . <p> " Says he ca n't do anything . " <p> She looks at the surgeon , who has swiveled on his stool so that he faces her now . " That 's right , Mrs. McMahon , " he says in a loud , clear voice . " Nothing I can do . " <p> It seems to McMahon that Annie 's eyes , made bright by a film of tears , look almost young again . Jesus , he thinks , what will happen to her ? That sweet woman . <p> He gets up and walks over to her . He stoops and places his hand over her elbow . " Well , Annie , " he says , " I reckon we best be headed home , let these folks get back to business . " <p> " What ? " she says . <p> " Home , " he tells her . <p> " There are things we can do , " the surgeon says . " Sometimes radiation helps . " <p> McMahon does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her little claw-footed metal walker in one hand , his elbow in the other . Then he looks at the surgeon and says , " Cure me , will it ? " <p> " It might give you more time . It might let you eat a little . " <p> " What 's the odds ? " <p> " I 'll make you an appointment with Dr. Johns . He 's the specialist . " McMahon gives him a half-grin . " First one you dodged , " he says . The surgeon smiles , shrugs . " Odds are good it 'll give you a couple more months . Might let you eat a little . Eggs maybe . Even that 's a long shot . " <p> " Eggs . " He laughs outright . " Well , fuck it then . " <p> " Donald ! " Annie 's the only person on earth who calls him Donald . <p> " You have to do what he says . " <p> He looks at her , surprised that she 's heard . <p> " I mean it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> He turns back to the surgeon . " My Annie , " he says . " You make the appointment . I 'll think about showing up . We 'll split it up that way . All right with you ? " <p> " The girl at the desk , she 'll give you a time . " <p> He pulls in at the White Spot on the way home . " What are you doing ? " Annie asks . <p> " We 're going to go in here , and you 're going to order yourself one of their burgers with the fried onions on it , and I 'm going to get me two of them , like I always have , and we 're going to eat . " He says this at such volume that the man getting out of the truck next to them turns and looks . <p> " You ca n't eat , " Annie says . <p> " I can die trying , " he says . <p> He helps her out of the car and lends her his supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diner . He orders and then tells the waitress they 'll need a pitcher of water . " And bring it now , you do n't mind . Got to get the skids greased . " <p> He and Annie do n't talk while they 're waiting for the food . He 'd have to talk so loud that it would be like making a public speech . McMahon would like to say something , tell her maybe that he does n't want to go back to the clinic , does n't want to let strangers decide how he will spend the little time he has left . Or maybe he would just talk about how much he 's always liked these little burgers , the thin patties , the fried onions . He can remember when the place opened , back in the ' 50s . The first time he ate here , he was home on leave after Korea . The hamburgers were twelve for a dollar . The man who ran it then was the father of the one who runs it now-that man there , flipping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed across the back . And , hell , this man , the one here now , he must be sixty . Christ , it comes and it goes . They give you a little time in the sun , and then they drag the darkness down . <p> He reaches across the table and lays his right hand atop Annie 's left . She stares at their hands for long moment , and he knows she 's trying hard not to cry . Then she looks up at his face . She leans forward , touches his cheek with her free hand , and tells him she loves him . He nods and says he loves her too . She ca n't hear him . He knows that . And maybe he should say it again , loudly enough so that she-and everyone else in the diner-can hear . But he does n't . Instead , when she takes her hand away from his face , he takes that hand too . And he holds it . And as he looks at her then , he thinks how old she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the food comes , they move so the waitress can set the plates down . Annie folds her hands in her lap and lowers her head . He watches her . Grace . She 's never doubted that . <p> Of course , he ca n't eat . Nothing gets down . He goes to the toilet and gags up the bite he tried to swallow . He returns to the table and watches Annie eat her burger . She does it without appetite . A duty . <p> McMahon believes in nothing outside of this life . Not really . There may be some kind of God , but He does n't pay much mind to any of us . World War II taught McMahon that . He 'd been on two ships that had been torpedoed and sunk off the coast of North Africa . He had floated in an ocean full of dead men . Who lived and who died-it had all been shit luck , cold chance . But he 's glad now that he went to church with Annie almost every Sunday of the forty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let her see him as one of the redeemed . Maybe that will be enough to get her through . <p> He tells himself that next time he 'll try to do better with Web . He owes it to Annie . Pretty soon , Web will be all she has . <p> It 's a twenty-mile drive from the White Spot to their old white hillfarm house . McMahon drives and wonders how long he 'll be able to do that . When they pass the county hospital , he says , " That 's where Josie was born . She was the only one of us born in a hospital . " Josie was the youngest of his nine brothers and sisters . They 're all dead now . He thinks about how they died , each of them - and where . All but two of them died in a hospital . <p> It 's a bright afternoon . The middle of May . The trees are lush . There are flowers everywhere , bursts of color in every yard . As they pass the veterans ' cemetery , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the benches near the ground he 'll be buried under . But he decides that would worry Annie , and he drives on . <p> When they get home , he gets out of the car and helps Annie . As they 're walking , he looks over her head at his garden . The tomato plants are already thigh-high . " Well , " he says . " I reckon a man 's still got to tie up his tomatoes . " <p> McMahon is right . Web does come back . He 's with them now in an examining room at the clinic , and they 're listening to the radiological oncologist . He 's a small , neat , soft man who speaks in a low , smooth voice . McMahon decides there 's no point listening to this man , much less talking to him . Here he is , this doctor , surrounded daily by the dying , and he does n't know anything but to lie . <p> " It 's terminal , you 're saying , this cancer ? " Web asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Here at the HooperKrock Clinic , " he says , " we do n't believe in terminal illness . " He smiles . <p> Web rocks back a notch . " What ? " <p> " We have to remain positive , " the doctor says . " Attitude is everything in a case like this . " <p> " In a case like what ? " <p> " Like this , " the doctor says . " Life-threatening . " <p> " But not terminal ? He wo n't die . " <p> " We ca n't say that . But we ca n't give up . " <p> Web looks at McMahon , who shrugs . He 's a little tickled by this , McMahon is . After all , it was Web who persuaded him to show up for the appointment , Web who told him over and again that he could n't just think about himself , that he had a family , that he owed it to all of them to let the doctors do what they could . That he owed it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No point in this , " McMahon tells Web . " You looking for straight answers , and this man , he 's a fucking radiation salesman . " <p> Web laughs , a big , loud , good laugh . McMahon likes that . It 's one of the things he 's always liked about his son . He says , " Let 's take your momma home . " <p> But then the doctor changes . He gives them a brisk , blunt assessment of what the radiation might do . It ca n't hurt anything , and there 's a fair chance it could help . It 's a statistical certainty that it wo n't save McMahon 's life . An extra two or three months , that 's what they 're talking about . A little time . " It wo n't make you sick , not the way it used to . We 've gotten much better with that . You might lose some hair . You might feel a little weaker during that time . But you 'll just have to come over here once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , and you 'll feel better for a while . I ca n't say how long . " <p> " What did he say ? " Annie asks . <p> " Two or three months , " Web says . Then he raises his voice . " He says the radiation might give Dad two or three more months . " <p> She turns to McMahon . " I want those months , " she says . McMahon nods . " My Annie , " he says . <p> A week later , Web 's back . The three of them are in the living room in the old farmhouse . McMahon is sitting in his recliner . He 's not wearing a shirt . He took it off to show Web the blue cross at the top of his chest , just below his neck . It 's the target for the radiation machine . Just yesterday , McMahon had his first treatment . Web sits at the end of the couch nearest McMahon . Annie 's on the couch too , at the other end . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She just looks at one or the other of them every so often and smiles . As long as Web and McMahon are talking without raising their voices , Annie can hope they 're making up . McMahon knows that . And he 's decided to try . He 'll talk to Web . He 'll listen . He 'll do his best to understand . He wo n't say anything hard , even when he thinks it 's the hard thing that needs to be said . <p> They have finished talking about the radiation for now , and Web is telling McMahon that he and Ellen have talked . They 've decided to take some time and think things through . She wants to be sure . She wants Web to be sure . She does n't want them to make the same mistake again . They need to wait . <p> What they 're waiting for is for me to die , McMahon thinks . But he does n't say anything . And , Christ , who knows ? Maybe his death is what they need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to say something , so he does . He says , " That makes sense to me . There 's a lot of pain there . You want to go easy . " <p> " Too much , maybe , " Web says . " Too much . I do n't know . " He leans forward on the couch . He looks down . <p> McMahon wants to tell him , Buck up , be a man , cut her loose . But he does n't . He does n't say anything . <p> Web looks up , sits up , shakes his head . " I 'm sorry , " he says . " Here you are with cancer , and I 'm complaining about my problems . " <p> " Hell , death 's easy , " McMahon says . " Nothing you can do about it . But you now , you got choices to make , one way or the other . " <p> McMahon watches Web think about this . " There 've been times , " Web says , " when the thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It sounds like a line he 's rehearsed . This is n't the turn McMahon wanted the talk to take . " Ought not be , " he says . " You 're way too young and smart to be looking for solace . There 's too many other things to try . " <p> Web nods . " Painting , " he says . He looks toward the front window as if there might be something out there he could paint . Then he looks down at his lap . Then he looks up at McMahon . " When I understood how good you had to be at it to make it matter , I quit trying . I got scared . I played games with paint , but I never painted . " He nods again . " That 's what I 've decided to do now . I 'm going to paint . " <p> McMahon wonders whether that 's something Ellen told him , or maybe the moon-ward doctors . But " Sounds good to me , " he says . " It 's what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , it is . " He hesitates , and McMahon can feel an edge in the air . " Look , " Web says . " I have n't talked to Mother about this . I know what she 'll say . She 'll say yes to anything I ask . And then you 'll say yes . For her . I do n't want it to happen that way . " He stops again . <p> " Want what to happen ? Say yes to what ? " <p> " I want to paint you . I want to move in here-for a while , anyway , the rest of the summer , maybe . And I want to paint you . " <p> Now it 's McMahon who does n't know what to say . <p> " You must think I 'm some kind of vulture , asking this . And maybe that 's right . I do n't know . I just know I want to do it . " <p> " And if I say no ? " <p> " I wo n't mention it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " You think you can stand living here ? " <p> " If I 'm painting , I can . This matters to me . You , me , the painting . Even if I ca n't do it , I 'll know it mattered . I wo n't be able to kid myself anymore . " <p> " Well , all of us , you know , we 're good at finding ways of kidding ourselves . No matter what . " <p> " Not about this , " Web says . " I know the difference between a real painting and a fake one . For a lot of my life , I 've wished I did n't . " He gives a half-nod to help make the point . " Look , " he says . " If I fail , it 'll be an honest failure . I promise you that . " <p> " Well , then , " McMahon says . " I ca n't say no to that . " <p> Web moves in two days later . He sleeps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twin bed in it . The same pine desk he used in high school is there too . There 's an end table and a lamp on one side of the bed , a window on the other , a cheap chest of drawers against one wall . Otherwise empty . It looks like what it has been-a room no one uses . <p> Other than his painting , drawing , and writing materials , Web does n't bring much . A few changes of clothes , the necessary toiletries , a couple dozen books . He says he 'll do the cooking and cleaning , drive Annie to the grocery store or Wal-Mart or wherever she needs to go , and do whatever McMahon wants him to do in the garden . He wants to help , he says . He does n't want to be any burden . <p> He offers to drive McMahon to the clinic for his radiation treatment , but McMahon says there 's no need for that . Not yet . He 'll drive himself-and Annie , if she wants to go-as long as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . <p> And so they settle in . <p> The radiation does n't cause McMahon any real problems . He does n't even lose any hair . And he enjoys the weekly drives to the clinic with Annie . He keeps the window down , the air conditioner off . He likes the sun , the movement , the way memory seems to enter the car with the warm wind . <p> They do n't talk much during the drives . He 's fine talking to Web or most anyone else . He still tells stories to whoever comes by the house for a visit , anyone who can hear . But if he says more than a sentence or two so that Annie can hear them , he can feel a strain in his upper chest , can feel what he calls the termites in his throat . Sometime before he dies , he 'll probably lose his voice . The termites will take it . He knows that . If you look at it one way , it 's funny . An old man who ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A marriage . <p> Six weeks go by , and McMahon loses thirty more pounds . He 's down to 160 now , 50 pounds less than what he calls his living weight . He 's getting by on juice and broth and Ensure . Once in a while he manages to choke down a little yogurt , but it 's not worth the trouble . " Hell , " he tells Annie , " you go to all that trouble , it 's still yogurt . " He still has n't lost any hair-or not enough to be noticed , anyway . The radiation therapist tells him he 's lucky , almost everyone loses some hair , and a lot of people lose it all . " Hell , me , " McMahon says , " I got hair with a positive attitude . It 'll keep growing after I 'm dead . " <p> McMahon is so weak he lets Web drive him and Annie to the clinic every Tuesday . A couple times a week Web also drives Annie to the Superstore , pushes her up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out groceries and toiletries . Nights , Web sits with McMahon in front of the TV and watches the Braves . Sometimes , Annie sits with them . Now and again McMahon catches her looking uncertainly , hopefully at him or Web . Usually , though , she falls asleep after an inning or two . <p> One night McMahon 's in bed asleep , and then , just like that , for no good reason , he 's awake . He feels an absence beside him . Annie 's not there . He raises his head a little and sees her kneeling against her side of the bed . He looks at the nightstand clock . Nearly three o'clock . He lies there on his back , watching her , tears in his eyes . He knows what she 's praying for . She 's been praying for it since Web was a teenager . She 's praying that her husband and her son , the two people on earth she loves , will learn to love each other . <p> McMahon 's on morphine now , and he spends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his paper and his coffee to the back porch , sits in the old high-backed , split-cane rocker , and stays there until nearly noon . Most mornings , Web is out there with him for the first couple hours . He begins by taking photographs of McMahon from different angles and distances . He uses two cameras , one for color , one for blackand-white . When he has taken his photographs , he sets up his easel , places his sketchpad on it , and begins to draw . All this photography and drawing-and , even worse , the apologies Web keeps offering-bothers McMahon . He does n't want Web out there-does n't want anyone there , not even Annie most of the time . He just wants to sit on his own in the silence and the sun . And this ... well , this seems so , what ? Scientific , or something . Some kind of experiment Web 's doing . It would be just like him to think that if you did everything just so , followed the right set of rules , gauged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . <p> The first few drawings each morning are quick , rough sketches .

He 'll sometimes spend an hour on the last one . When he finishes , he puts all the morning 's drawings in a folder , carries the folder to the porch swing , and sits there for a while . He and McMahon talk a little then , or try to . Neither of them knows what to say . It 's very awkward . Web makes the silence that surrounds them seem unnatural . <p> At the end of the first morning , McMahon asks to see the last drawing . But the request makes Web dodgy . It takes him several nervous minutes to explain that the drawings are n't ready to be seen yet-he 's still getting his eye , his touch . It has been so long , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This seems so painful to Web that McMahon lets it go , and nearly three weeks go by before Web carries a morning 's final drawing to McMahon and holds it up before him . McMahon is surprised by how much he likes it . You can see death in every line of the face , but a dignity-or maybe just the memory of a dignity-remains in the eyes and the mouth . McMahon looks at Web . He understands that his son has made him an offering , an offering he has worked hard to make right . " I forgot how talented you are , " McMahon says . " An awful thing for a father to have to say . But it 's true . It 's something you have that has nothing to do with me . So I forgot about it . I 'm sorry . " <p> There are tears in Web 's eyes .

" God 's own . " <p> Web is back in fifteen minutes with the Camels and a black Bic lighter . " Been fifteen years , " McMahon says . " Got to where I had bronchitis about two-thirds of the time . " He taps the pack sharply against the arm of his rocker . Then he opens it and takes out a cigarette . He looks at Web and offers him one . Web takes it without hesitation , clearly pleased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first Web 's cigarette , then his own . <p> He coughs once , then again . He 's dizzy for a moment and a little queasy . He lets his head and stomach settle before taking a second drag . Much better . And the next drag is better still . He holds the cigarette out and studies the burning tip . " By God , " he says , " I 've loved these sons of bitches . " <p> Web laughs , that good deep laugh . <p> And then they begin to talk , light talk but real , about smoking and quitting smoking . <p> In the days that follow , Web continues to start their morning by taking photographs , but now he 's painting after that instead of drawing . Some days he works five or six hours without a break . McMahon is content to sit that long and longer . Sometimes he thinks he could just sit there day and night until he dies . Often now Annie comes out on the porch and sits with him . They rarely say anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure on her face . He knows she thinks her prayers have been answered . It 's funny , McMahon thinks : All they needed to become a family , the three of them , was a killing cancer , a steady supply of morphine , and , on Web 's part , about thirty years of failure . <p> One evening McMahon and Annie are sitting at the kitchen table . Annie is eating a bowl of chicken noodle soup and a pimento-cheese sandwich she bought that afternoon when Web took her to the Superstore . McMahon 's having his Ensure , which Annie has poured into a fluted glass . The stuff looks like Pepto-Bismol . McMahon wishes it tasted as good . He 'd rather be in the den watching the game , but he does this for Annie . He has gagged about half the Ensure down when the front door opens . McMahon hears Web walking through the living room and dining room , talking to someone . McMahon ca n't make out the words , but he knows who the other person has to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sees her just behind Web , in the doorway . Ellen . <p> They 're dressed up . Web 's wearing a wheat-colored jacket , a tie . Ellen 's in a nice blue dress . Good-looking people , for their age . They should 've had kids . <p> McMahon looks back at Annie . She 's intent on the soup . She still has n't heard anything . He says , almost yelling , " Annie . The kids are back . " <p> She looks up at him , then turns and raises her gaze to take in Web and Ellen . " You all sit down , " she says . Her chair jerks backward . " I 'll get you some ... some supper ? " <p> McMahon holds up his glass of Ensure . " Got plenty of this . Buy it by the goddam case . " <p> Web goes to Annie , puts a hand on the back of her chair , bends down and kisses her on the forehead . " We 're fine , Momma . We 've already eaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at Ellen . " Come on in , " he says . " Sit down . " <p> She does . Web sits across the table from her . There is a silence . <p> McMahon does n't know what to say . This is the woman Web has loved and hated and ca n't get over , the one who has marked him for life . Maybe he ought to just live with her , do the suffering face to face . McMahon takes a sip of the Ensure , sets the glass down , shakes his head . " Cure you of wanting to live , this stuff . You get done , you got to lick a dog 's ass to get the taste out of your mouth . " <p> Web laughs , but Ellen merely smiles politely , tolerantly . " It 's our anniversary , " Web says . " We went to Bella Italia over in Ft . Smith . " <p> " You bring me a sausage ? " McMahon says . <p> Web smiles , says nothing . <p> " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks at Ellen , then back at Web . " Which anniversary , I mean ? " <p> " Thirty years , " Web says . " 1971 . " <p> McMahon nods . He lets them watch him think about the thirty years . " You 're back together then ? " <p> " We do n't know , " Web says . " We 're talking . " McMahon looks at Ellen . <p> " We want to be sure , " she says . " Sometimes I think we were always wrong for each other . " <p> McMahon shakes his head . " No such thing as being sure , " he says . " You and Mrs. McMahon , " Ellen says . " You 're sure . Anyone can see that . " <p> McMahon cocks his head as if in surprise . " Me ? Annie ? Oh , no . " He gives a short nod and a half-smile . " I been married fifty-eight years . " He lets the smile broaden . " To the wrong woman . " <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . But she laughs . " Piece of wisdom , " McMahon says . " Only one I got to pass on to you . You fall in love , and then sooner or later you going to find out it 's to the wrong woman-or man , your case . Question is , what do you do then ? " <p> " What 's he saying ? " Annie asks Web . <p> " He 's telling Ellen about marriage . " Web enunciates the words loudly , slowly . " About you and him . " <p> " Lord have mercy , " she says . And then she laughs . <p> Two weeks later , on a Wednesday , McMahon loses his voice . The cancer is in his larynx . He can make himself understood if the listener sits close and leans forward . But it 's all breath , little rushes of air . And he 's in his wheelchair almost all the time now . He can walk no more than a step or two . He has to have help in the toilet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the morphine . <p> Web is still taking pictures every morning and still painting too . He 's finished three portraits , but has n't been satisfied with them . McMahon does n't think any of them is as good as the drawing . But he 's in a morphine haze , and , like everything else , his eyes are going . So he does n't know . <p> Ellen has n't been back . Web says they 're still talking , still thinking . They 've hurt each other a lot . They still do n't know what they 'll do . McMahon suspects that whatever they do they 'll be sorry . Sometimes that 's the way it is . <p> In the evening Web wheels him out on the porch . Annie joins them . Web begins saying the things he needs to say-that he loves McMahon , that he 's sorry he hated him so long , that he 's going to keep painting , that he 'll paint as well as he can , do honest work , that he 'll take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listens and nods . He reaches over and touches Web 's arm . Web takes the hand and holds it . He quits talking . McMahon is staring at the sunset . " Annie , " he says . But there is only the forcing of breath , no sound she could possibly hear . <p> Still , the sky-an old glory of dying light . It is beautiful . It is almost enough . <p> He knows he will not see another . <p> Author Affiliation
