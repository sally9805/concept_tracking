Section : THE CULTURE WAR <p> Freethinkers are always happy to discover like minds engaged in free inquiry in an otherwise unthinking society . But there 's nothing quite as vindicating as those occasions when famous people have the audacity to raise their voices and speak freely about their aversion to organized religion . <p> As a journalist , interviewing as many as one hundred musicians every year , I 'm always amazed at the number of artists who do just that . In a country where more than 70 percent of the people consider themselves Christian , the number of freethinking musicians seems to level the playing field . In fact , artists might be the freethought movement 's greatest ambassadors simply because they are able to communicate freethinking to the masses as few others can . <p> Take for instance Sean Danielsen , front-man for the band Smile Empty Soul ( Lava Records )  --  a well recognized band with a song on the Spiderman 2 soundtrack . In an interview I conducted earlier this year Danielsen told me that his antipathy toward religion would likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does on the current self-titled album . " Religion is just such a big bad part of my life that it 's going to come out , " he said . <p> And it 's easy to understand why religion has had such an effect on the artist . According to the biography on the band 's website ( **31;974;TOOLONG ) , at the age of seven Danielsen 's " very religious " mother and stepfather took him to live in an abandoned summer camp in Maine . Isolated for three years in what he described as " the middle of the forest , " Danielsen now freely expresses his displeasure with organized religion and the effect it has on people like his parents : <p> I 'm definitely against all organized religion just because , when you really look at it , organized religion has caused most of the death in the history of this planet . Most of the wars were fought over organized religion . And if people would just give that shit up it would solve a lot of problems in this world . <p> Lyrically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 350,000 copies , is laden with critiques of religion . Take for instance the lyrics of " Every Sunday " : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> One of the group 's music videos , " Nowhere Kids , " which was yanked off the air by MTV , takes on sexual abuse by the clergy . " It starts with a scene of a perfect suburban family standing in front of their house , " explained Danielsen . " Their priest is there . The video is real dark . Later on in the video the dad pretty much beats the son and the priest molests the little boy . And because people do n't want to see shit like that right now , we get our video yanked . " <p> Danielsen and his band Smile Empty Soul , however , are anything but alone in their discontent with religion . <p> The veteran punk-metal rock band , Boy Sets Fire ( Wind-up Records ) , also tackles organized religion on its current album , Tomorrow Come Today . Songs like " Bathory 's Sainthood " attack blind dogmatism : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Nest lambastes wishful thinking . " It 's just about hope and its ability to basically heal what 's going on in our country , " explained vocalist Nathan Gray , " and that wishes are bullshit , something you can throw around without responsibility . If you 're hoping for something , you have to make it happen . " <p> One of the more profound and best-known freethinking artists , Ani Difranco , has recently released a beautiful album , Educated Guess , comprised of penetrating , often deeply rational lyricism . One of its better songs , " Animal , " takes time to briefly step on the toes of Christianity : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> But Difranco is anything but coy about her thoughts on hardcore Bible thumpers . In her poem " Literal , " featured in the CD booklet , she gracefully takes on religious literalists : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Yet of all the freethinking popular artists currently making waves in the music industry , none compare to the kind of overt iconoclasm of Bad Religion . <p> After twenty years in the industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold , Bad Religion is likely the best-selling , openly atheistic rock band in American history and is renowned as one of the best punk bands ever . Bad Religion 's latest album , The Empire Strikes First , features the band 's most transparent ode to atheism , appropriately entitled " Atheist Peace . " Though the song runs just three seconds shy of two minutes , the lyrics , sung by Greg Graffin , are as brazenly poignant as the song is blazingly fast : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Bass guitarist Jay Bentley told me that the song is Graffin 's way of showing how people without religion are often above the frays resulting from religious conflicts . Bentley adds : <p> I think that Greg 's concept of " Atheist Peace " is basically just saying , " Look , a lot of today 's problems are being sparked by religion ; " and that 's true in America and it 's true in the Middle East . There 's a lot of issues that are coming up because of religious ideology . And I think what Greg is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have those problems . I do n't feel oppressed by another religion and I do n't feel like I have to defend my faith . " <p> Graffin , an avowed atheist , recently received his doctorate from Cornell University . Bentley says Graffin 's denunciation of religion stems from the studies he conducted for his thesis , which , according to Bentley , focuses on religion and its effect on the evolution of humankind . " Graffin 's pretty much being straightforward about his feelings , " said Bentley . <p> Expressing himself fully , Graffin offers an even bolder diatribe , on traditional notions of God 's beneficence in " God 's Love " : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Other songs like " The Quickening " and " Live Again  --  The Fall of Man " are replete with rational appeals for science and reason over faith . <p> When it comes to spreading the word of reason , many of us are probably inclined to give all the credit to academic intellectuals , scientists , and philosophers . But we should also realize the vital role artists play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Artists have the ability to speak to people at a level of intimacy often unattainable by scholars . And bands like Smile Empty Soul and Bad Religion and musicians like Ani Difranco prove that religion does n't have a monopoly on poetry and art ; freethinkers , liberated from religious dogma , are often the world 's best creators . <p> By Jeff Nall <p> <p> Jeff Nall lives in Central Florida .
