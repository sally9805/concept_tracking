<p> The first few days after his son was born , Scott Johnson had only one prayer . <p> He whispered it aloud heading from his Lawrenceville home to Gwinnett Medical Center , where his wife , Tori , and their baby were hospitalized . He repeated it while he stood outside the neonatal intensive care unit , looking at the tangle of tubes and wires coming from the baby 's covered crib . <p> It was his first prayer of the morning and the last he exhaled at night . <p> " God , please take care of Robert Scott . I ca n't be his father . You 're the only father he has right now . " <p> Like most babies in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit , Robert Scott was born prematurely , 12 1/2 weeks earlier than the 40-week ideal . <p> That was 16 months ago . Then , confronted with the circumstances of his son 's birth , Scott Johnson thought , " I ca n't pick him up . I ca n't hug him . I ca n't show him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The memories are still painful for Johnson . Though he considers his son 's progress miraculous , tangible evidence of God 's grace , he knows some medical challenges await . But he says he has learned to live one grateful day at a time , and to cherish having his son and wife with him . <p> For a few days in September 2002 , he feared he would lose both . <p> Multiple complications at birth <p> The neonatal ICU at Gwinnett Medical Center is a quiet place , with dimmed lights and carpeted floors . You can hear the gentle whoosh of breathing apparatuses and see numbers glowing on machines . Many babies lie in isolettes designed to ease the transition from womb to world , their eyes shielded from light , their bodies wrapped in blankets . Nurses keep vigil . <p> Typically , the longer a baby stays in its mother 's womb , the better its chances . Some babies in the facility arrive after only 23 weeks and have a 25 percent chance of surviving , said nurse Betsy Dodson . Babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance . <p> Complicating Robert Scott 's condition was that his mother had peritonitis , a severe infection , when he was born on Sept. 2 , 2002 . It had developed two weeks after doctors removed her ruptured appendix . The baby weighed 2 pounds , 13 ounces at birth . Besides pneumonia , he had a low number of platelets , the cells that cause blood to clot . He was also jaundiced , with low blood sugar . But his parents were thankful he was alive . <p> With his wife and baby sick , Scott Johnson , then 27 , spent days and some nights in the hospital . The Johnsons have attended North Metro Baptist Church since they moved from Knoxville to Gwinnett four years ago . People from his Sunday school class wanted to visit , but Scott did n't want to see them . He was living the crisis ; he did n't want to talk about it . <p> Four days after Robert Scott was born , his left lung collapsed , and another line was inserted into his body . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 28 , was passing out from pain in the middle of a sentence . But , drip by drip in her intravenous line , she began to improve . <p> When she was well enough to get out of bed , her first destination was the neonatal ICU . She peered through the window at her baby 's isolette , wishing she could hold him . She could n't . She blew him a kiss and waved . <p> " There was n't much we could do for him , " she said . " When I came home from the hospital , I was eaten up with what else might happen . When I finally realized that there was nothing I could do to prevent anything from happening , I had to turn it over to God . " <p> Eventually , she and Scott could touch their child . Two places on his body did n't have a tube inserted or a wire attached : the top of his head and a small place on his side . As soon as Tori and Scott touched him , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate slowed . <p> ' Kangarooing ' helps <p> The Johnsons said they were aware of people praying for them : people in their church , family and friends in Thomasville , Cartersville and throughout Georgia and Tennessee . The names of the Johnsons were circulated on e-mail lists , passed from one neighbor to another . They say that these prayers helped sustain them . <p> By early October , a month after Robert Scott was born , he was medically stable , which meant his parents could pick him up and give him a sponge bath . Such an ordinary event seemed extraordinary to them . They began holding him on every evening visit to the hospital , cradling him and having a family devotional . <p> The staff of the neonatal ICU cites studies showing that skin-to-skin contact between parent and child helps a baby to thrive . The practice is called " kangarooing , " and the Johnsons began doing it with their son in a private room . They were willing to do anything if it could help him , Dodson said . <p> " Tori @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work out , " she said . " They were so positive . They were at peace that we would do the best for their baby . " <p> One evening when the couple got to the unit , Scott began crying . He pointed to an empty corner where an isolette had held a baby a few weeks younger than Robert Scott . The isolette had been moved . The baby had died . The couple was reminded , Tori said , " that that could be any of us . " <p> By Nov. 12 , eight days before his actual due date , Robert Scott had made significant progress and weighed 4 pounds , 13 ounces . The only lines coming out of his body were a feeding tube and a breathing tube . <p> " It was hard to get Robert Scott off the ventilator , " said Dodson , who was the baby 's nurse during the last part of his hospital stay . <p> Robert Scott 's lungs were n't fully developed when he was born , and initially he needed lots of respiratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three breathing machines . They damaged and scarred his lungs , but doctors expect his lungs to regenerate as he gets older . <p> Two weeks before Christmas 2002 , Tori and Scott brought their baby home , taking a tank of oxygen and a cache of medications for his stomach , lungs and bowels . Tori sent an e-mail to friends and family , announcing the joyous homecoming . <p> For months , there were two oxygen tanks in their house , a big one in the living room downstairs , a smaller one in the baby 's room upstairs . They checked monitors and followed a strict schedule for medications . <p> In the winter months , they took three trips back to the hospital with Robert Scott when respiratory problems erupted . A rotation of therapists  --  physical , speech and occupational  --  still visit the Johnson house regularly . <p> Last July , Tori reached a milestone : She took Robert Scott to the Mall of Georgia without his oxygen tank . For the first time , passers-by did n't ask what was wrong with her baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his dimples and big blue eyes . <p> " I was just another mother , with another baby , " she said . " It was thrilling . " <p> Still some questions <p> Robert Scott continues to make progress . Half walking , half crawling , he can scoot across the family 's living room floor and reach the second-floor stairs in less than a minute . They have mounds of toys to amuse and distract him . <p> Tori and Scott still are n't comfortable taking him to the church nursery , fearing he 'll catch a cold that will develop into pneumonia . They 'll take him when he 's stronger . <p> Doctors have told the Johnsons there 's a chance Robert Scott could be mildly retarded or develop cerebral palsy , but no one knows yet . What is known is that he has a 12-millimeter hole in his heart . When it shrinks to 3 or 4 millimeters , surgeons will close it , sometime after his second birthday . <p> In the meantime , the Johnsons take nothing for granted . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee , " Tori said . " We 're on the efforts committee , but he runs the results committee . " <p> Sometimes late at night , when the Johnsons are lying together in their bed , Scott waits until Tori 's breathing becomes deep and regular , signaling that she 's asleep . He slips out of the covers and walks into Robert Scott 's room . <p> He stands by the crib , watching his son 's tiny chest moving up and down , up and down . He gently touches his son . <p> When Scott comes back to his bedroom , he watches his wife sleeping for a few seconds , just to make sure she 's still there .
