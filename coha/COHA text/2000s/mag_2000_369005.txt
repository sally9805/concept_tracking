Lonnie Johnson had come home to tinker again . In 1982 the young nuclear scientist spent his days developing advanced space systems for the Strategic Air Command . At night , while his wife and kids slept upstairs , he used mathematic and scientific formulas to launch his own dreams from the basement . He had built a model of a heat pump that used water instead of unfriendly Freon . Attaching a homemade nozzle to the end of tubing and connecting it to his bathroom sink , he carefully turned on the water . It shot out a stream so powerful that its air currents ruffled the curtains . " Eureka ! " Johnson told himself . " This would make a great water gun . " <P> The rest , as they say , is history . Johnson , a small-town prodigy called the Professor by his high school buddies , had wrought one of the best-selling toys ever : the Super Soaker , a pump-action water gun capable of streaming water 50 feet . In the 12 years since he first got U.S. Patent No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is listed in official government records , more than 200 million Super Soakers have been sold . Revenue estimates for the gun range as high as $400 million . " Lonnie is the American success story , " says Dick Apley , director of independent inventor programs for the U.S. Patent Office . <P> The Super Soaker is just one of 62 patents ( with an additional 18 pending approval ) that Johnson has amassed since his basement days . He 's had ideas for hair-drying rollers , a digital thermostat , a baby-diaper detector that activates musical nursery rhymes when wet , and a device that measures soil moisture and waters grass automatically . Many of his ideas never went further than the prototype . He did n't have the money or the contacts in those early days to push them into production . " There are all kinds of ways to skin a cat , and there are all kinds of mousetraps , " says Johnson , 51 . " Lady Luck is indifferent . She smiles sometimes , and she frowns sometimes . " <P> History books already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , showing his work next to the everyday inventions of other black scientists and engineers who are relative unknowns : the man who invented refrigerated trucks , the woman who developed a machine for hair permanents or the man who patented the automatic traffic signal . Officials from the Patent Office , which reports that only 6% of patent applications come from blacks , hail Johnson as a role model and cite his Super Soaker to capture the imagination of schoolchildren . <P> As a kid in Mobile , Ala. , Johnson says , he was inspired by the legend of George Washington Carver . Johnson was born to a large family in the segregated South ; his father worked as a civilian driver at the local Air Force base , and his homemaker mother sometimes worked in a laundry or as a nurse 's aide . In the summer , Johnson 's parents would pick cotton on his grandfather 's farm . The family lived on $126 a month , but they were not so poor as others in the neighborhood .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
