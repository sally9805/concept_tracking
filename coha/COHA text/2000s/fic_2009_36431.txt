1 <p> Best Performance by a Bad Girl <p> Oscar night . Hollywood . The blaze of klieg lights . The smell of perfume , jasmine , and fear in the air  --  I love it . <p> No evening in the year holds greater power . To those who soar or suffer by Hollywood 's whims , this annual honor , bestowed by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences , is instant and indelible . Tonight , amid the glitter and pageantry , transformations would occur . A thousand well-dressed people would walk into Hollywood 's Kodak Theatre , but in three hours ' time , only a few dozen of them would walk out holding golden statuettes , branded for the rest of their lives : THE BEST . <p> And before those worthy names could be called onstage inside the theater , another glittering pageant was well in progress outside . We had a little ritual of our own that also glorified the evening 's finest talent but perhaps , in a moment of much-needed balance , punctured a few inflated egos as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I took my part on the star-spangled battlefield . I , Maxine Taylor , have the privilege of holding a mike and brushing elbows with the great ones  --  and the battle scars that come with it . While the talent of the stars is luminous , fascinating , unquestionable , their fashion choices may not be . Someone , after all , must play the role of jester at Hollywood 's royal court , and that would be me . <p> The crowd around me , Jack Nicholson bumping into Leo-nardo DiCaprio , was aswirl . In my earpiece , the voice of my young , hotshot director , Will Beckerman , boomed , " Max , grab Cameron ! " And suddenly , as is the nature of the evening , a gorgeous young celebrity dressed in some unfortunate piece of satin was thrust at me by her phalanx of handlers . I let go of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie , two solid-gold " gets , " allowing them to be pulled off into the onrush of lights and crowds , and I revved up , turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me into a nice tight two-shot . <p> " Cameron Diaz is here , " I announced to my athome audience above the noise of the throbbing crowd . I 'd snagged another Alister before any other red carpet reporter . Everyone kept a scorecard of gets , a list of celebrity interviews one was able to get , and our careers could be instantly over if our ratio of Alist to Blist should suddenly fall . Hundreds of my competitors , stretched down a long row beside me , were now quietly seething at my good fortune . I blocked all that out as my camera 's onair light glowed red . <p> Cameron smiled and said , " Max Taylor ! It 's good to see you . " There was the requisite hugging and kissing . Then she added , " Be nice . " <p> We both laughed . Like that would happen . <p> Over broad whitened smiles , Cameron and I eyed each other closely . What she saw was a fairly well-kept faux-blond , thirty-three-year-old woman . ( Okay , who was I kidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they could put bamboo under my nails , and I 'd still deny it . ) I was dripping in borrowed estate diamonds and draped in a stunning gold Michael Kors gown . Tasteful ... yet wow . Cameron 's eyes narrowed , recognizing perhaps that I now wore the same borrowed diamond earrings she 'd worn two years ago . <p> I , on the other hand , felt my own eyes grow wide as I gazed at the outfit she 'd selected . " Who are you wearing ? " I asked , my raspy voice perhaps just a tad raspier , gaping at the monstrous green gown that only a Trappist monk could love . <p> Cameron mentioned the name of a young designer , then turned 360 degrees so we could absorb the full effect of all those wasted yards of seaweed-hued satin . " Tell the truth , Max , " she said like a brave young thing who was ready to take her medicine , " what do you think ? " <p> " It 's something ! " I marveled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Cameron beamed . " You doll . " <p> Then , before I could add , ... but you 're not one of them , she heard her name called from the stands of screaming fans and turned to wave . That 's the red carpet . Blink and your interview is O-V-E-R . <p> I quickly changed gears . As the dewy beauty was whisked away to yet another interview , trailing a long train of poison-green tulle , I turned to my camera . " Cameron Diaz . Someone I love and adore and worship . But I have to tell you  --  even Winona Ryder would n't shoplift that dress . " <p> Yes , I said that . <p> Oh , come on . I 'm Max Taylor , and that 's my thing . I worked my way up from the cellar comedy clubs in Manhattan by telling the truth and saying what no one else would say . Look , I 'll make a promise : if you should discover the cure for cancer , I swear I will not make a joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You , Cancer Curer , are safe with me . Global-Warming Averter , too . But everyone else ... watch out . <p> The mad swirl of pre-Academy Award excitement ratcheted up a notch , and I checked my borrowed diamond-encrusted Harry Winston watch : twenty-six minutes until Oscar showtime inside the Kodak Theatre , if one could trust a $140,000 timepiece to tell good time . Which meant in just twenty-six minutes , our red carpet coverage would end , and I still had n't nailed an interview to top last year 's show . And in the castle where I work , they serve last year 's jester as appetizers . Around me , the throng of glittering almost-stars , ministars , megastars , and over-the-hill dino-stars , along with all their nervous star tenders , began pressing forward as they realized it was time to get out of the hot afternoon sun and into their seats . <p> I , as always , kept right on talking  --  " Was n't Julia Roberts gorgeous this year ? The government should pay her to stay home and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  filling the airtime until my next celebrity was delivered . <p> Just off-camera was my own crew , the guerrilla commandos who kept me powdered and prepped throughout two hours of red carpet combat : hair , makeup , personal assistant , darling pet , all accounted for . Add to this behind-the-scenes cadre my celebrity-wrangler , Cindy Chow , the predatory huntress who even now stalked arriving VIPs , tracking down the most transcendent names for me to interview . Cindy , with her disgustingly thick black hair and tall , slender , pilates-toned body , looked like your typical , everyday fabulous L.A. chick . But do n't let the sweet demeanor and those double-C cups fool you . That woman has a vicious streak , which is an excellent trait in a wrangler . She was waving at me to get my attention . <p> " Ah , " I said , spying the man she had in her hot little hands , " here comes a repeat Academy Award nominee , the guy who Walked the Line , Joaquin Phoenix . " I jabbed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brooding movie star coming up the red carpet . " Joaquin ! " I shouted , trying not to spit . It 's a hard name to pronounce . Try it . <p> He slowed down but did n't quite make eye contact . <p> " Amazing performance , Joaquin , " I yelled . Why had n't Cindy brought him closer ? He was just outside mike range . Joaquin , what kind of mother names her son Joaquin ? Clearly a mother who does n't give a damn who spits at her kid all his life . <p> He took another step toward me , but then , pulled along by his agent and still several feet from my particular square of red carpet , he came to a complete halt . <p> My earpiece buzzed alive . " Where the hell is your next interview ? " screamed my frazzled director . I was now on the air , live , interviewing nobody . I momentarily envisioned Cindy losing her job in the bloody postmortem of this night 's show . It was war , and our side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great crush , Deborah Norville stepped off her mark and grabbed Joaquin 's arm , snatching him away for herself . I was furious and tried to reach for him myself , but Little Miss Locust Valley Tea Party had a grip on him that could win her a World Wrestling title . Bitch ! Of course I kept score . We all do . " You lost him , " cried my director into my ear . Like I did n't know that . " We 're dying here . Go to Drew , " his voice ordered . <p> " Let 's see who Drew is talking to now , " I said to the camera , seamlessly moving our live show along , segueing to my daughter , who held an interview position with her own camera crew closer to the door of the Kodak . I checked the video monitor and saw my lovely daughter and cohost standing next to the extraordinarily tall and dreamy Vince Vaughn . Our director , Will , was still yelling something stupid in my ear , but I was at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-five years old and single , so why was n't this naturally endowed girl wearing a " bait " dress with the neckline cut down to her waist ? I despaired of her insistence on good taste . Opportunity missed . <p> " Say hi to Vince for me , " I said cheerfully , handing the show off . Drew laughed her sparkling professional laugh and took it from there , and my own camera light went dark . <p> It 's kindly been noted by the press that with my first red carpet coverage of the Oscars in 1985 , I invented the red carpet arrival . But now , alas , dozens of entertainment news outlets have charged onto the scene : Entertainment Tonight , Access Hollywood , along with all the networks and hundreds of magazines , so we are in a glutted market . Drew and I are the featured hosts with cable television 's firecracker-style network , Glam-TV , and the suits at Glam expect us to outdo our competitors , star for bloody star . It 's cutthroat . With such jackals as Diane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuit ( I kid , but you do n't want to get near an elbow when Charlie is running after Jennifer Lopez ) , the thing that distinguishes our trademark red carpet coverage for Glam boils down to a steady stream of big names , their own unfathomable sense of style , and , frankly , what unrehearsed and exciting moments Drew and I can coax out of them . Clearly , we are at a disadvantage without some big stars , and standing out on the carpet without a gigantic celeb next to me for more than thirty seconds of wasted time , I was now starting to get cranky . <p> I looked over at my wrangler , Cindy , my inner temperature rising . Her job was to provide fresh meat . She 'd bungled Phoenix , and amid this blinged-out courtyard maelstrom of yapping publicists and beefy hangers-on , Cindy appeared not to be giving up without a fight : she was hanging on to the tuxedoed arm of Jamie Foxx as if her career were passing before her eyes . With Phoenix gone , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spotted the superstar 's limo as it pulled up to the curb , expertly identifying Foxx through ultradarkened windows ; made a beeline up to the rear door , outrunning the wrangler from Extra , elbowing aside the wrangler from E ! , and tripping the wrangler from the BBC ; caught Jamie by the sleeve of his midnight blue Armani jacket just as he stepped out onto the carpet ; and herded him , between his stops to wave at the throngs of screaming fans in the bleachers , right down to my portion of the red carpet . On a good day , Cindy was like an Australian shepherd in a beaded Vera Wang . Looked like she was getting back to a good day . Thank God . <p> Billy Bush , standing down the row of entertainment reporters , called out , " Jamie ! Over here ! " and almost got his attention . Devon Jones from Entertainment Tonight screamed even louder , " Jamie , loverboy ! " and at that , Jamie turned his head . But Cindy hung on tight and delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said just as my camera 's light glared red . Finally . As we chatted about his picks for the Oscars this year , I heard Drew in my earpiece , letting Will , back in the control booth , know she was ready to go with Naomi Watts . <p> Drew has been my cohostess on all our Glam-TV Red Carpet Specials . While at age fourteen she had shown signs of a mother allergy so severe she had caused me to reconsider with dismay the sixty-one hours of hard labor I 'd endured to bring her into this world , Drew had , at age twenty-five , grown up into a friend and wonderful interview partner . We make a good team . All the stars who will no longer talk to me  --  the bastards  --  will stop for Drew , who is young and bright and , let 's face it , less lethal . Better for our show , she knows and likes all of young Hollywood  --  she went to school with many of them  --  and that history works in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stand at the head of the line , and she always stands at the last position on the red carpet , ready to catch any celebrities who might manage to float past me on their way into the Kodak . <p> If I am like the strainer in the sink of Hollywood , Drew is the trap down at the bottom of the drain . <p> The pace of our preshow was picking up . Jamie Foxx left . Drew interviewed Naomi . I got a few quick words with Halle Berry , who looked amazing in Prada , and Sigourney Weaver , who did n't . Only twenty minutes until the doors to the Kodak would be closed . A crush of jewel-encrusted attendees choked the courtyard . <p> As we broke from our nonstop coverage for a quick commercial break , I turned to look at all the splendor and spandex . Between Drew and me was an ever-moving ocean of celebrities : Daniel Day-Lewis , Keira Knightley , and Cate Blanchett , each trailed by cameramen with handhelds grabbing full-length " beauty " shots ; film producers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wives they were most likely cheating on ; Denzel Washington escorting his beautiful daughter ; young actors and the scantily clad teenagers with whom they were falling in or out of love ; the accompanying fleet of agents , public relations mavens , managers , mothers , escorts , flacks , and handlers ; closeted gays and their " girlfriends " ; out lesbians and their girlfriends ; and a string of dozens of fixed-camera units focused on entertainment reporters who were feasting on all the glamour like a gang of dolled-up vampires with their fangs in the neck of Hollywood . I shook my head . Poachers ! <p> I looked up to see George Clooney approaching . Now , this was more like it . In my ear , I heard Will 's voice barking that we had thirty seconds to air , but with George on the way , I began to relax for just a second . In this business , that is one second too long . <p> George is always a doll , and the renewed , super-charged-up Cindy had nabbed him , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air , ET 's Devon Jones circled around Cindy and George , and then begged his publicist , Stan Rosenfield , " Stan , let me have five seconds . " <p> " No ! " I shouted over the crowd , glaring at Cindy . <p> " Three seconds , " Devon pleaded , tugging on the publicist , who was holding on to George . " We 'll put you on the air , too . " <p> " We 're ready right now , " I lied . But all could see that my red light was off and Devon 's was on . <p> Meanwhile , Will , watching our lost skirmish from the control booth where he could see us from various angles on many screens , had been in the middle of counting down to my live shot with George . " Five  --  four  --  three  --  " he 'd been saying . Then , suddenly , he screamed in my ear , " Damn it ! You lost another one ! " <p> Cindy , in shock , grabbed hold of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to reporter Sam Rubin on live coverage , and spun her around , propelling her in my direction . <p> " ... two ... one ! " came the disembodied voice of Will in the last of the countdown from my earpiece . <p> " Hi , Pam , " I said brightly , " I see you brought your two most dazzling accessories . " Then I immediately launched into an impromptu discussion on her latest marriage and divorce situation , making several bitterly brilliant jokes about failed relationships . This was not the lightest subject for me to joke about these days since Drew 's engagement to that idiot Burke Norris had recently been called off . The story goes that she dumped him . Technically . But her decision was heavily influenced by his appalling fondness for spending the night at other women 's apartments . It made my teeth hurt ; I detested him so much , but okay . Drew was moving on . They were simply incompatible . She was a Pisces , and he was an asshole . <p> " One minute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood smiling at my live camera , reminiscing off the top of my head about all the brooding leading men I had once known or , frankly , fantasized about . <p> Meanwhile , Cindy was trying to snatch back our lost star George Clooney , who was now graciously receiving suck-up compliments from Devon Jones as the precious remaining minutes until the Oscar telecast clicked off . <p> My lineless eyes narrowed . No matter how expensive her borrowed dress , Devon looked , as always , cheap . She had taken thin to an extreme and had yet to find a shade of red that did n't make her look like a hooker long past retirement age , but that was simply no excuse to swipe the Aest of the Alisters from the clutches of my wrangler and keep him for herself . Devon was known to be a talent-challenged reporter , but she had been around the block and had hung on to her job year in and year out by finding ever new ways to stoop lower . <p> Cindy , at this point , slammed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also off-camera , stood my hearty behind-the-scenes crew . No one in my position can do the job alone , and I do not perform without wonderful backup . Allie , my makeup girl , with her waiting powder brush , and Unja , my hairstylist , with his can of hairspray , shook their heads in sympathy at the lethal Clooney poaching . My stern Samoan driver/bodyguard , Malulu Vai , held my tiny Yorkshire terrier , Killer , and both looked equally miffed . <p> Pam Anderson said , " And that 's why I am planning to take night classes at UCLA . " With a wave , she walked on . <p> Meanwhile , Cindy looked after the one that got away , her eyes frantic . Clooney 's publicist was edging George down the runway . Devon 's " three seconds " had turned into " a thirty , " and she clearly was n't letting George move on . Noting all this , I still had to keep my head in the game , so I gave my live TV audience a brief review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could go wrong ! She looked amazing from the ankles up , but did you see her shoes ? Are you kidding me ? The straps . The platforms . The rhinestones . The tassels . Cinderella would rather stay single than put those on . " <p> My support team , off-camera , were all amused . Only I really feel the pressure . Only I know quite literally how we are doing at every second of the show . This perception of the rhythm of the show fuels my performance but also makes me vibrate on a slightly higher key  --  all my senses ratcheted up . My support crew , however , never quite gets how seriously we are teetering on the brink of disaster . Even now , Allie was bent over laughing , which drives me crazy . Unja was just happy to be at the Oscars . Even my Yorkie , Killer , had a smile for me . Okay , from Malulu I got nothing , but what else was new ? <p> Then , from out of nowhere , Cindy refished Joaquin Phoenix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . <p> " Here he is ! " I shouted out to all of America . " The guy who so brilliantly played Johnny Cash in Walk the Line , a movie , I should point out , that made me realize not all country singers pee out the window of their tour buses and wear Roach Motels around their necks . Oh , " I assured my audience , " some do . They 're animals , believe it . But not all ! So I learned something . The man you 're all waiting to meet . Here 's ... " <p> Cindy , still out of my camera shot , turned a shade of purple that did n't really go with her peach gown . She had lost Phoenix yet again . This time , he chose to schmooze with the beautiful Scarlett Johansson . Cindy started giving me big , call-it-off hand signals , arms swinging down across her body as if she were waving off a jet from landing on an aircraft carrier in stormy seas . <p> At this point , time ticking away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right oncamera broken one of our unspoken rules and glared a bit at Cindy from my upstage eye , but as I had just had that very eye relifted not too long ago , I resisted the urge . Here I was , Maxine Taylor , the Queen of the Red Carpet , with no star to interview . <p> " Screw him , that bag of no talent , " I said to my camera brightly . " Here 's an even better star ! " Take that , Joaquin . And this time , with my famous croak shouting above the crowd noise , I yelled out , " George ! George ! " and George Clooney , God love him , waved at me , breaking off from talking to Devon . He came over and spoke to me for a full , undivided minute and gave me the worldwide exclusive on what brand of underwear he preferred ( Calvins ) . Is there any wonder why women worship this man ? It was a glorious red carpet moment ! <p> The next interview was Drew 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my stylists rushed in to powder and straighten and spray . <p> " You were so funny , " giggled Allie as she touched up my lip gloss with a tiny brush . In addition to knowing her Bobbi Brown from her Laura Mercier , Allie was an insistent laugher . <p> " You do n't have to laugh , " I told her . " You do makeup . That 's enough . " She 'd been doing my makeup for seventeen years , and we 'd had three hundred of these conversations . <p> " George Clooney ! " moaned Unja , as he rushed up with a hairbrush at the ready . I had recently discovered Unja , my darling new hairstylist , on a visit to London , and for tonight 's event I had brought him to the States for his first visit . Surrounded by all this glorious Hollywood manhood , Unja was coming unglued . He 'd brought a tiny camcorder and was now documenting every second of the trip . Here , closer to celebrities than he 'd ever been in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cap and had it on permanent record mode . Unja fingered my straight blond bangs a quarter inch to the left and said distractedly , " I wish these were longer . " <p> " I ca n't see . " <p> " Who cares ? This is so now , " Unja advised . <p> " I suppose it could help , " I added . " I 'm blind as a bat , so when I say to somebody , ' I did n't know who you were , ' they 'll just think it 's the hair . " <p> Allie , bringing out her powder brush and swiftly powdering down my shine , giggled . <p> Unja pushed daintily at the ironed-straight bangs . " I can move them over a smidge . " <p> " Just part it so that the iris shows . " <p> He worked on it . " This style is really hot , " he added in his cute British accent . " You look like a Jewish Marilyn Monroe . " <p> " Right . The way she looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could now see my precious teacup Yorkie , Killer , over on the sidelines . Killer , seven pounds of pure personality and fluff , tilted his little head , and I smiled at the good boy , who was staying so nice and quiet while Mommy worked . <p> Holding Killer was my Samoan bodyguard , Malulu Vai . Tall , swarthy , and devoted to plus-size pantsuits , Malulu had come to me four years ago after a scary fan incident , but I had kept her around long after it turned out that idiot had misaddressed two hundred passionate love notes meant for Liz Taylor . Anyway , I had become fond of Malulu . Okay , she probably was n't the only graduate of the University of Pago Pago with a BA in philosophy to be employed as a driver , but I appreciated her for her other handy skills : she had an instant grasp of every sort of technological gizmo and gadget , was a master of the secret and deadly Samoan martial art , Limalama ( " hand of wisdom " ) , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twelfth Night and Fiddler on the Roof with a Samoan lilt . <p> Malulu looked at me , perplexed . " Marilyn Monroe , she was Jewish ? " Unfortunately , Malulu has absolutely no sense of humor . Tell me I 'm not being punished . <p> Through the earpiece , I heard Will 's squawk : " In fifteen seconds we go to commercial . You can wrap it up , Drew . " <p> I checked the Winston . In just nine minutes we would finish our show and be off the air , but first a long commercial break . <p> Cindy came rushing up to me . " Joaquin Phoenix . That bastard ! I 'll make it up to you . I promise . I 'm so  --  " <p> I waved her apologies away . Like it or not , we are in the major leagues . There is only one Academy Awards night . If one member of the team blows it , we 're all out of work on Monday . " Drew , " I hissed , " who does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finishing up with Matt Damon ! " I let the accusation hang in the air . <p> " Mom , " Drew called , pushing through the crowd . Cindy melted into the background . <p> I looked up through my bangs , startled . Drew , having completed her interview and thrown to commercial , had rushed over to my camera position to see me . <p> " Drewie , we only have a few minutes on this break . " <p> " Five , " she said . " Mom , we need to talk ! I just got the most amazing text message . " She held up her BlackBerry , waving it . <p> " It better not be phone sex from that traitor Joaquin Phoenix , because I 'm telling you , I am through with men with scars . " <p> " You wo n't believe this , Mom . I just got a text from Halsey ! " <p> Oh , no . Not Halsey again . While everyone admired Halsey Hamilton 's talent , her life choices were just a shame . Drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and somehow Drew had appointed herself the rescue ranger for this mixed-up girl , but it was like trying to save a drowning elephant . When it came to screwing up a life , Lindsay and Britney could take lessons from Halsey Hamilton , who was currently the tabloid princess du jour . <p> I looked at my daughter  --  beautiful dress , beautiful jewels , beautiful skin she 'd inherited from her mother  --  and worried , yet again , at her commitment to her bent-on-destruction friend . A year of headlines had screamed , " Halsey in Club Raid ! " " Halsey Busted for Pills ! " " Halsey in Rehab ! " " Halsey in Rehab Again ! " " Halsey Fills Out Permanent Change-of-Address Card and Directs Mail to Rehab for Life ! " Only in the last few months had the headlines died down . Even after her role in the Best Picture front-runner , The Bones of War , brought her a Best Actress nomination , Halsey had kept an amazingly low profile . <p> " So ... what ? She 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As if that were a question . <p> " No , no , no , " Drew said , smiling . " She 's fine . She 's great . " <p> " Wonderful , " I said , unable to resist pushing my daughter 's long , dark hair off her face . Instantly , Unja appeared with a hairbrush , his videocam still attached to his head , and quietly went to work , performing magic on her heavy curls . <p> Drew knew my feelings regarding her hairstyles and suspected sabotage . " Mom ! " <p> I looked all innocence . " What ? Unja thinks you need a little help . Humor him . " To distract her , I recalled , " Halsey 's in Expectations , is n't she ? " I referred to the luxury rehab facility in Malibu that had been the temporary home to many of Hollywood 's young and wasted . It was such a shame about all these girls . But with Halsey it was somehow worse . She 'd risen from a celebrated childhood acting for Spielberg and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and blossomed into that miracle , a child star who still looked good after puberty and could act . But with all the fame and the money came the turmoil . She 'd been arrested so many times for drinking and driving , her bail bondsman had given her a bythe-dozen discount . <p> " She 's not at Expectations anymore . She checked out of there in November , " Drew said . " She moved to another rehab place called Wonders in Pasadena . " <p> " Thanks for telling me . " I looked at Drew accusingly . She and Halsey had been close for several years . Drew , about six years ahead of Halsey at school , had been her " big sister , " so you think I would have been told . <p> " You never listen , " Drew replied . <p> " That 's because you never tell me anything good . " <p> Mother . Daughter . Does it ever change ? <p> Drew , her hair now completely gorgeous , gently waved Unja away . " Mom , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know . " <p> I was impressed . Usually Halsey had her people issue a press release every time she went to the bathroom . Good for her . Maybe this time all the help the poor girl was paying for was actually working . <p> In our ears , Will 's voice snapped , " Two minutes to air . Drew , get back to your place . " <p> " Mom , " Drew said , waving her BlackBerry . " Halsey completely disappeared for months . She 's been taking care of herself . She 's doing the steps . She wanted to stay away from Hollywood until she had four months of sobriety . But ... " <p> " But what ? " <p> " Mom , " Drew said , abruptly changing the subject . " Tell the truth . How are we doing tonight ? " <p> " We 've done better . I counted thirty-two gets . " <p> " Twenty-nine , " Drew said . <p> " Damn you for being better at math than I am . " <p> " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretend , but what good does that ever do ? We were now in a crowded field , and our ratings would only stay high if we delivered the best stars . Twenty-nine gets meant we were down five from last year . That 's huge . We 'd get the final ratings for our show later , but I knew in my gut we were going down . So , yes , we were in trouble . <p> Drew knew it too , yet she looked excited . " Mom , Halsey is the answer . " <p> " She 's not coming tonight , is she ? " It had been rumored and reported for weeks that she would absolutely not jeopardize her shaky sobriety by attending the awards show . Even Perez Hilton , the Web gossip star , assured fans Halsey was n't coming . <p> " She 's here ! " Drew whispered , waving the BlackBerry . <p> " Can we get her ? " This would be phenomenal . Amazing . No one would remember the ones we missed if we got an ungettable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ten other gets . I felt the adrenaline pump . I recalled years past and the many sleepovers at our old Bel-Air house  --  Halsey hanging out with Drew and her big-girl friends . <p> From our earpieces we both heard Will 's warning : " One minute ! " <p> " Oh , yeah , " Drew said , smiling . " She says she 'll only do one interview , and we have it ! " <p> I smiled back at my adorable , sensible , sober daughter . " I always liked Halsey , Drewie . She 's a troubled girl , but good , thank God . She remembers you have always been a very good friend to her . " <p> " No , no , she wants to talk to you . " <p> " What ? Why not you ? " <p> " She 's wearing an amazing outfit and wants you to do your whole Max Taylor fashion thing . Look , she 's pulling up in that white Hummer limo . See ? " <p> I looked off in the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sucker out of the toilet yet . The only red carpet show to get Halsey Hamilton . On earth . Exclusive . I could imagine tomorrow 's network coverage of the Oscars : wall-to-wall video clips on every channel . The winners . The fashions . And Best Actress Halsey Hamilton  --  it could happen  --  in her shocking return to Hollywood , as seen in her exclusive interview with ... me . The public would walk over nails to see her . What did Halsey look like after these long months of exile ? Had she let her hair grow out ? Did she get a few tattoos removed ? Had she bought underpants ? In an instant , our fortunes had turned . <p> Drew squeezed my hand , then pushed quickly back to her spot as Will counted down the seconds to airtime in our ears . <p> My red light blinked on . " Hello , we 're back ! What a wild night this has been . But get ready . We have lots more show coming . And wait ! We have big news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's awards ceremony , the adorable Halsey Hamilton , is on her way here right now . " <p> Quickly , Malulu , always dependable , slipped me an info card on Halsey below camera range as I continued , " It 's a night to congratulate Halsey on her magnificent performance in one of the year 's best films , and we certainly will , but this one dramatic high point only accentuates many , many lows . Everyone knows the regrettable events . The arrest for indecent exposure on a Singapore Airlines flight to Asia , where charges were eventually dropped . The rush to St. John 's hospital after her eighteenth birthday party where her stomach had to be pumped after eating , her publicist later claimed , too many pieces of rum-spiked birthday cake . The fourteen-hour marriage to Thom Denney , the drummer of indie band Whaler , who , it turned out , was still married ; and the wedding-night video threesome with the minister  --  as seen on YouTube . All tragic missteps . " <p> In the background , I could hear an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen , doors are closing . Please take your seats . Doors are closing . " <p> I pressed on . " But here 's our happy ending . Halsey went away to rehab . She got the help she needed . She straightened herself out . And now the Best Actress nominee for The Bones of War is coming here . To the Oscars ! Tonight . So stay right with us here on Glam-TV , because I have the one ... and only ... interview with Halsey Hamilton . " <p> By this point , even I was excited about what was to come , but scanning the now thinning crowd , I noticed with a weary eye that Halsey had not yet appeared . Damn ! I listened to my earpiece and followed Will 's onthe-fly advice . " But first , " I said brightly to the camera , " Drew has both Colin Farrell and Will Ferrell . Take it away , Drew . " <p> The camera light went off and all hell broke loose around me . Danny , my bald lug of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap and dirty jeans topped by the required formal dinner jacket  --  was the first to speak . " Hey , Max . No shit . Halsey is talking to us exclusive ? " <p> " Yes . So listen up . " My troops  --  Allie , Unja , Danny , Cindy , and Malulu , holding an alert Killer  --  gathered . " Look around chickadees . The news has broken . " Actually , I myself had just announced Halsey 's surprise arrival , but now every news director from here to Uzbekistan had heard me and alerted the media . Damn . <p> The buzz was working its way around the red carpet . I saw Ryan Seacrest practically drooling and making a run for the open drop-off spot at the curb . MTV 's coolest entertainment reporters , those hot young Sullivan brothers , Matt and Kevin , thought nothing of knocking Ryan aside . Mary Hart , Lisa Rinna , Sam Rubin , Devon Jones , and Al Langer were grabbing their portable mikes and heading over . Even Charlie Gibson looked longingly at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several hundred were craning their necks to see if Halsey was arriving . We had to get this right . <p> " Now , look , " I said , " Cindy ... " <p> My wrangler , tall and gorgeous in her strapless gown , shiny black hair pulled back , looked alert . " I 'm on this , Max . " <p> " No excuses , no regrets . Halsey is mine . Understand me ? Mine ! Do not let this one get away or you 'll be floating facedown on the Yangtze River ! " <p> " I 'm on this , " Cindy repeated , a strained smile on her face . She lifted her beaded gown and ran off . That girl ran like a gazelle . <p> Allie powdered my forehead , but I shooed her away . " Can you see Cindy ? Did she get to Halsey ? " The curb was only about fifteen feet away , but even up on my four-inch-high , **26;2005;TOOLONG Manolo sandals I could n't see over the crowd . <p> " Look , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best view . " Halsey 's limo has arrived , but the door has n't opened . She is n't coming out . Hey , it 's a feeding frenzy near that limo . " <p> Despite my Michael Kors and my diamonds , I realized this was not the time for ladylike . I was off-camera , and as long as Drew kept one of her Farrell-Ferrells joking and the other one smoldering  --  not such an easy task  --  my mike was not " hot . " Stepping up onto a packing crate , which the faithful Malulu miraculously procured , I screamed out , " Cindy ! Halsey is ours . Exclusive . Go and get her ! " <p> The circus of reporters and cameramen with handhelds crowding close at Cindy 's heels , pressing hard against Halsey 's limo , heard me too . For that matter , who , even as far away as Santa Monica , had n't ? <p> Cindy saluted me , then , shoving the crowd back , she knocked hard on the window of the long , white stretch Hummer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and looked inside . Whatever she saw inside Halsey 's limo , Cindy threw her hands up to her mouth and did n't make a move . <p> What ? What could Cindy possibly be thinking ? Ticktock , ticktock . We were minutes from the end of a live telecast . If Halsey had become momentarily shy of the press  --  that would be a first , but after four months stashed away at rehab , who could blame her ?  --  Cindy just had to gently urge her along . <p> On the small television monitor that showed the live feed of our program , I could see the right-this-second live version of our show as it was being broadcast to all of America . Drew was wrapping up her segment , having both laughed at Will Ferrell and drooled at Colin . She was now ready to throw the show back to me . <p> " Cindy , " I yelled to my girl at the curb , just nanoseconds before my mike would go live again . " Just grab her ! Bring her ! Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The crowd of reporters and cameramen with handhelds did n't give an inch , but Cindy knew what was at stake . She slivered herself into the open limo door and disappeared . <p> Minutes seemed to chug by . Hours . Days . Then Cindy 's Vera Wang-covered butt backed out into view . <p> " Are you getting this , Danny ? " I called to my cameraman as he worked the lens to focus a close-up on Halsey Hamilton emerging from the Hummer . From my earpiece I heard the end of Drew 's " ... so back to you , Mom . And say hi to Halsey for me ! " <p> " Yes , Drew . I will ! " I said into my suddenly hot mike . Just a few feet away at the curb , Cindy , having pulled Halsey onto the red carpet , cautiously kept her hand locked on Halsey 's wrist . But Cindy stepped out of the way and allowed the world to welcome this returning princess . <p> " Oh my God ! Oh my God ! " whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wearing ? " demanded Unja in his stiff British accent , from behind his little personal camcorder , aghast . " Do you like her gown ? " <p> " Dat not funny , " added Malulu , holding a well-behaved Killer . <p> Halsey Hamilton , the nineteen-year-old beauty with the head of shining auburn tresses , was now standing in full view of the screaming fans , amid dozens of flashbulb-popping paparazzi and the entire international press corps . <p> Did I like her gown ? <p> What gown ? <p> Tall , slender , stunning Halsey was standing on the red carpet . <p> She 'd remembered to do her hair . <p> She 'd remembered to do her makeup . <p> She 'd forgotten to put on her clothes . <p> Copyright 2009 by Joan Rivers and Larry A.
