Alex Morse charged through the lobby of the new University Medical Center like a doctor to a code call , but she was no doctor . She was a hostage negotiator for the FBI . Twenty minutes earlier , Alex had deplaned from a flight from Charlotte , North Carolina , to Jackson , Mississippi , a flight prompted by her older sister 's sudden collapse at a Little League baseball game . This year had been plagued by injury and death , and there was more to come  --  Alex could feel it . Sighting the elevators , she checked the overhead display and saw that a car was descending . She hit the call button and started bouncing on her toes . Hospitals , she thought bitterly . She 'd practically just gotten out of one herself . But the chain of tragedy had started with her father . Five months ago Jim Morse had died in this very hospital , after being shot during a robbery . Two months after that , Alex 's mother had been diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive the week . Then came Alex 's accident . And now Grace  - -  A bell dinged softly , and the elevator opened . A young woman wearing a white coat over street clothes leaned against the rear wall in a posture of absolute exhaustion . Intern , Alex guessed . She 'd met enough of them during the past month . The woman glanced up as Alex entered the car , then looked down.Then she looked up again . Alex had endured this double take so many times since the shooting that she no longer got angry . Just depressed . " What floor ? " asked the young woman , raising her hand to the panel and trying hard not to stare . " Neuro ICU , " said Alex , stabbing the 4 with her finger . " I 'm going down to the basement , " said the intern , who looked maybe twenty-six  --  four years younger than Alex . " But it 'll take you right up after that . " Alex nodded , then stood erect and watched the glowing numbers change above her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commuting by plane from Washington , D.C.  --  where she was based then  --  to Mississippi to relieve Grace , who was struggling to teach full-time and also to care for their mother at night . Unlike J. Edgar Hoover 's FBI , the modern Bureau tried to be understanding about family problems , but in Alex 's case the deputy director had made his position clear : time off to attend a funeral was one thing , regularly commuting a thousand miles to be present for chemotherapy was another . But Alex had not listened . She 'd bucked the system and learned to live without sleep . She told herself she could hack the pressure , and she did  --  right up until the moment she cracked . The problem was , she had n't realized she 'd cracked until she caught part of a shotgun blast in her right shoulder and face . Her vest had protected the shoulder , but her face was still an open question . For a hostage negotiator , Alex had committed the ultimate sin , and she 'd come close to paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plate-glass partition , what would have been a miraculous escape ( being grazed by a couple of pellets that could have blown her brains out but had n't ) became a life-altering trauma . A blizzard of glass tore through her cheek , sinuses , and jaw , lacerating her skin and ripping away tissue and bone . The plastic surgeons had promised great things , but so far the results were less than stellar . They 'd told her that in time the angry pink worms would whiten ( they could do little to repair the " punctate " depressions in her cheek ) , and that laymen would n't even notice the damage . Alex was n't convinced . But in the grand scheme of things , what did vanity matter ? Five seconds after she was shot , someone else had paid the ultimate price for her mistake . During the hellish days that followed the shooting , Grace had flown up to D.C. three times to be with Alex , despite being exhausted from taking care of their mother . Grace was the family martyr , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : tonight it was Grace lying in an intensive care unit , fighting for her life . And why ? Certainly not karma . She 'd been walking up the steps of a stadium to watch her ten-year-old son play baseball when she collapsed . Seconds after she hit the stairs , she voided her bladder and bowels . A CAT scan taken forty minutes later showed a blood clot near Grace 's brain stem , the kind of clot that too often killed people . Alex had been swimming laps in Charlotte when she got word ( having been transferred there as punishment duty after the shooting ) . Her mother was too upset to be coherent on the phone , but she 'd communicated enough details to send Alex racing to the airport . When the first leg of her flight touched down in Atlanta , Alex had used her Treo to call Grace 's husband , whom she 'd been unable to reach before boarding the plane . Bill Fennell explained that while the neurological damage had initially not looked too bad  --  some right-side paralysis , weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which the doctors said was not uncommon . A neurologist had put Grace on TPA , a drug that could dissolve clots but also carried serious risks of its own . Bill Fennell was a commanding man , but his voice quavered as he related this , and he begged Alex to hurry . When her plane landed in Jackson , Alex called Bill again . This time he sobbed as he related the events of the past hour . Though still breathing on her own , Grace had lapsed into a coma and might die before Alex could cover the fifteen miles from the airport . A panic unlike any she had known since childhood filled her chest . Though the plane had only begun its taxi to the terminal , Alex snatched her carry-on from beneath the seat and marched to the front of the 727 . When a flight attendant challenged her , she flashed her FBI creds and quietly told the man to get her to the terminal ASAP . When she cleared the gate , she sprinted down the concourse and through baggage claim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and told the driver she 'd give him $100 to drive a hundred miles an hour to the University Medical Center . Now here she was , stepping out of the elevator on the fourth floor , sucking in astringent smells that hurled her four weeks back in time , when hot blood had poured from her face as though from a spigot . At the end of the corridor waited a huge wooden door marked neurology icu . She went through it like a first-time parachutist leaping from a plane , steeling herself for free fall , terrified of the words she was almost certain to hear : I 'm sorry , Alex , but you 're too late . The ICU held a dozen glass-walled cubicles built in a U-shape around the nurses ' station . Several cubicles were curtained off , but through the transparent wall of the fourth from the left , Alex saw Bill Fennell talking to a woman in a white coat . At six feet four , Bill towered over her , but his handsome face was furrowed with anxiety , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence , he looked up and froze in midsentence . Alex moved toward the cubicle . Bill rushed to the door and hugged her to his chest . She 'd always felt awkward embracing her brother-in-law , but tonight there was no way to avoid it . And no reason , really . Tonight they both needed some kind of contact , an affirmation of family unity . " You must have taken a helicopter , " he said in his resonant bass voice . " I ca n't believe you made it that fast . " " Is she alive ? " " She 's still with us , " Bill said in a strangely formal tone . " She 's actually regained consciousness a couple of times . She 's been asking for you . " Alex 's heart lifted , but with hope came fresh tears . The woman in the white coat walked out of the cubicle . She looked about fifty , and her face was kind but grave . " This is Grace 's neurologist , " Bill said . " I 'm Meredith Andrews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Grace calls KK ? " Alex could n't stop her tears . KK was a nickname derived from her middle name , which was a family appellation : Karoli . " Yes . But please call me Alex . Alex Morse . " " Special Agent Morse , " Bill said in an absurd interjection . " Has Grace asked for me ? " Alex asked , wiping her cheeks . " You 're all she can talk about . " " Is she conscious ? " " Not at this moment . We 're doing everything we can , but you should prepare yourself for "  --  Dr. Andrews gave Alex a lightning-fast appraisal  --  " you should prepare for the worst . Grace had a serious thrombosis when she was brought in , but she was breathing on her own , and I was encouraged . But the stroke extended steadily , and I decided to start thrombolytic therapy . To try to dissolve the clot . This can sometimes produce miracles , but it can also cause hemorrhages elsewhere in the brain or body . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to risk moving Grace for an MRI . She 's still breathing on her own , and that 's the best hope we have . If she stops breathing , we 're ready to intubate immediately . I probably should have done it already "  --  Dr. Andrews glanced at Bill  --  " but I knew she was desperate to talk to you , and once she 's intubated , she wo n't be able to communicate with anyone . She 's already lost her ability to write words . " Alex winced . " Do n't be shocked if she manages to speak to you . Her speech center has been affected , and she has significant impairment . " " I understand , " Alex said impatiently . " We had an uncle who had a stroke . Can I just be with her ? I do n't care what her condition is . I have to be with her . " Dr. Andrews smiled and led Alex into the room . As she reached the door , Alex turned back to Bill . " Where 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ridgeland was a white-flight suburb ten miles away . " Did he see Grace fall ? " Bill shook his head somberly . " No , he was down on the field . He just knows his mother 's sick , that 's all . " " Do n't you think he should be here ? " Alex had tried to keep all judgment out of her voice , but Bill 's face darkened . He seemed about to snap at her , but then he drew a deep breath and said , " No , I do n't . " When Alex kept staring at him , he lowered his voice and added , " I do n't want Jamie to watch his mother die . " " Of course not . But he should have a chance to say good-bye . " " He 'll get that , " Bill said . " At the funeral . " Alex closed her eyes and gritted her teeth . " Bill , you ca n't  --  " " We do n't have time for this . " He nodded into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly to the edge of Grace 's bed . The pale face above the hospital blanket did not look familiar . And yet it did . It looked like her mother 's face . Grace Morse Fennell was thirty-five years old , but tonight she looked seventy . It 's her skin , Alex realized . It 's like wax . Drooping wax . She had the sense that the muscles that controlled her sister 's face had gone slack and would never contract again . Grace 's eyes were closed , and to Alex 's surprise , she felt this was a mercy . It gave her time to adjust to the new reality , however fleeting that reality might be . " Are you all right ? " Dr. Andrews asked from behind her . " Yes . " " I 'll leave you with her , then . " Alex glanced at the bank of CRTs monitoring Grace 's life functions . Heartbeat , oxygen saturation , blood pressure , God knew what else . A single IV line disappeared beneath a bandage on her forearm ; Alex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure what to do , and maybe it did n't matter . Maybe the important thing was just to be here . " You know what this tragedy has taught me ? " asked the familiar bass voice . Alex jumped but tried to hide her discomfiture . She had n't realized Bill was still in the room , and she hated showing any sign of weakness . " What ? " she said , though she did n't really care about the answer . " Money is n't really worth anything . All the money in the world wo n't make that blood clot go away . " Alex nodded distantly . " So , what the hell have I been working for ? " Bill asked . " Why have n't I just kicked back and spent every second I could with Grace ? " Grace probably asked the same question a thousand times , Alex thought . But it was too late for regrets . A lot of people thought Bill was a cold fish . Alex had always thought he tended to be maudlin . " Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alex asked , not taking her eyes from Grace 's face . She felt a strong hand close on her shoulder  --  the wounded shoulder  --  and then Bill said , " I 'll be back in five minutes . " After he 'd gone , Alex took Grace 's clammy hand in hers and bent to kiss her forehead . She had never seen her sister so helpless . In fact , she had never seen Grace close to helpless . Grace was a dynamo . Crises that brought others ' lives to a standstill hardly caused her to break stride . But this was different . This was the end  --  Alex could tell . She knew it the way she had known when James Broadbent went down after she was shot . James had watched Alex charge into the bank just seconds ahead of the go-order for the Hostage Rescue Team , and he had gone in right behind her . He saw her take the shotgun blast , but instead of instantly returning fire at the shooter , he 'd glanced down to see how badly Alex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second blast square in the chest . He was n't wearing a vest ( he 'd taken it off upon learning that the HRT was going in ) , and the shotgun chopped his heart and lungs into something you saw behind a butcher 's counter . Why did he look down ? Alex wondered for the millionth time . Why did he follow me in at all ? But she knew the answer . Broadbent had followed her because he loved her  --  from a distance , true , but the emotion was no less real for that . And that love had killed him . Alex saw tears falling on Grace 's cheeks  --  her own tears , numberless these past months . She wiped her eyes , then took out her cell phone and called Bill Fennell , who was standing less than thirty feet away . " What is it ? " he asked frantically . " What 's wrong ? " " Jamie should be here . " " Alex , I told you  --  " " You get him , goddamn it . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence . Then Bill said , " I 'll call my sister . " On impulse , Alex turned and saw him standing near the nurses ' station . He 'd been talking to Dr. Andrews . She saw him disengage from the neurologist and lift his cell phone to his cheek . Alex leaned down to Grace 's ear and tried to think of something that would reach the bottom of the dark well where her sister now dwelled . " Sue-Sue ? " she whispered , simultaneously squeezing the cold hand . Sue-Sue was another nickname based on a middle name  --  a family tradition . " Sue-Sue , it 's KK . " Grace 's eyes remained shut . " It 's me , Sue-Sue . It 's KK . I 'm back from Sally 's . Wake up , before Mama gets up . I want to go to the carnival . " Seconds dilated into some unknown measure of time . Memories swirled through Alex 's mind , and her heart began to ache . Grace 's eyes stayed shut . " Come on , Sue-Sue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Alex felt a twitch in her hand . Adrenaline surged through her , but when she saw the frozen eyelids , she decided that the twitch must have come from her own hand . " Kuh ... kuh , " someone coughed . Alex turned , thinking it was Bill or Dr. Andrews , but then Grace clenched her hand and let out a sharp cry . When Alex whipped her head around , she saw Grace 's green eyes wide-open . Then Grace blinked . Alex 's heart soared . She leaned down over her sister , because though Grace was only thirty-five , her eyes were almost useless without glasses or contacts . " KK ? " Grace moaned . " Iz zah wu ? " " It 's me , Gracie , " Alex said , rubbing a strand of hair out of her sister 's cloudy eyes . " Oh , Goth , " Grace said in a guttural voice , and then she began to sob . " Thang Godth . " Alex had to clench her jaw muscles to keep from sobbing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drool ran down her chin whenever she struggled to speak . She sounded exactly like Uncle T.J. , who 'd died after a series of strokes left him without a shred of his old identity . " Wu ... wu have tuh thave Jamie , " Grace gargled . " What ? I missed that . " " Havuh thave Jamie ! " Grace repeated , struggling to rise in the bed . She seemed to be trying to look behind Alex . " Jamie 's fine , " Alex said in a comforting voice . " He 's on his way here . " Grace shook her head violently . " Wissen ! Havuh wissen ! " " I 'm listening , Sue-Sue , I promise . " Grace stared into Alex 's eyes with all the urgency in her soul . " You  --  have  --  tuh  --  thave  --  Jamie ... Gay-Gay . You thuh ... onwe ... one ooh can . " " Save Jamie from what ? " " Biw . " " Bill ? " Alex asked , sure she must be wrong in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alex blinked in astonishment . " What are you talking about ? Is Bill hurting Jamie in some way ? " A weak nod . " Ee wiw ... thoon ath I 'm gone . " Alex struggled to understand the tortured words . " Hurt Jamie how ? Are you talking about some sort of abuse ? " Grace shook her head . " Biw  --  wiw  --  kiw  --  Jamie 's  --  thole . " Alex squinted as though trying to decipher some coded text . " Bill ... will ... kill ... Jamie 's ... soul ? " Grace 's head sagged in exhaustion . " Gracie ... Bill is n't my favorite person . You 've always known that . But he 's been a good father , has n't he ? He seems like a basically decent man . " Grace gripped Alex 's hand and shook her head . Then she hissed , " Eeth a monther ! " Alex felt a chill . " He 's a monster ? Is that what you said ? " A tear of relief slid down Grace 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then turned and glanced over her shoulder . Bill Fennell was still speaking to Dr. Andrews , but his eyes were on Alex . " Ith Biw coming ? " Grace asked in a terrified voice , trying in vain to twist in the bed . " No , no . He 's talking to the doctor . " " Dogtor  --  duthend  --  know . " " Does n't know what ? " " Whuh Biw did . " " What do you mean ? What did Bill do ? " Grace suddenly raised her hand and gripped Alex 's blouse , then pulled her head down to her lips . " Ee kiwd me ! " Alex felt as though ice water had been shunted into her veins . She drew back and looked into Grace 's bloodshot eyes . " He killed you ? Is that what you said ? " Grace nodded once , her eyes filled with conviction . " Grace , you do n't know what you 're saying . " Even with a partially paralyzed face , Grace managed a smile that said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean that . Not literally . " Grace closed her eyes as though gathering herself for one last effort . " You ... onwe one ... ooh can thop im . Too ... wate ... fuh me . I urd ... dogtuh ... out thide . Thave Jamie for me ... Gay-Gay . Pleath . " Alex looked back through the glass wall . Bill was still watching her , and his conversation looked as if it was winding down . Alex had always known Grace 's marriage was n't perfect , but what marriage was ? Not that Alex was any authority . She had somehow reached the age of thirty without tying the knot . After years of badge groupies and badge bolters , she 'd finally accepted a proposal , then terminated the engagement three months later , after discovering that her fianc was cheating with her best friend . In matters amorous , she was a ridiculous clich . " Sue-Sue , " she whispered , " why would Bill want to hurt you ? " " Thum-one else , " Grace said . " Wuh-man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a fact ? " Another half-paralyzed smile . " Uh  --  wife  --  knowth . " Alex believed her . During her engagement to Peter Hodges , a feeling very like a sixth sense had told her something was amiss in their relationship . Long before there was any tangible clue , she 'd simply known there was betrayal . If she had possessed the same instinct about conventional crimes , she 'd already be an SAC instead of a hostage negotiator . Correction , she thought , I 'm a common field agent now . " If Bill wants to be with another woman , " she said , " why does n't he just divorce you ? " " Muhn-ey ... dum-me . Would coth Biw miw-yens ... tuh do that . Five  --  miwyen ... may-be . " Alex drew back in disbelief . She 'd known that Bill had been doing well for some years now , but she 'd had no idea he was that wealthy . Why in God 's name was Grace still teaching elementary school ? Because she loves it , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grace had closed her eyes , seemingly drained by her efforts . " Tew ... Mom ... I tho-we , " she said . " Tew huh ... I be waiting fuh hurh ... in heaven . " The smile animated the living half of her face again . " If  --  I  --  make it . " " You made it , honey , " Alex said , balling her free hand into a fist and holding it against her mouth . " Well , look at this , Dr. Andrews ! " boomed Bill Fennell . " She looks like she 's ready to get up and out of that bed . " Grace 's eyes snapped open , and she shrank away from her husband , obviously trying to use Alex as a shield . The terror in her eyes hurt Alex 's heart , and it also thrust her into full-defense mode . She stood up and blocked Bill from coming to the bedside . " I think it 's better if you do n't come in , " she said , looking hard into her brother-in-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked past her to Grace , who was literally cowering in the bed . " What are you talking about ? " he asked angrily . " What the hell 's going on here ? Have you said something about me to Grace ? " Alex glanced at Dr. Andrews , who looked confused . " No . Quite the reverse , I 'm afraid . " Bill shook his head in apparent puzzlement . " I do n't understand . " Alex probed his brown eyes , searching for some sign of guilt . Grace 's fears and accusations were probably the product of a dying woman 's hallucinations , but there was no doubt about the reality of her terror . " You 're upsetting her , Bill . You can see that . You should go downstairs and wait for Jamie . " " There 's no way I 'm going to leave my wife 's bedside . Not when she might  --  " " What ? " Alex asked , a note of challenge in her voice . Bill lowered his voice . " When she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped toward Bill and said , " Perhaps we should give Grace and her sister some more time alone . " " Do n't try to massage me like that , " Bill said irritably . " I 'm Grace 's husband . I 'm her husband , and I 'll decide who  --  " " She 's my blood , " Alex said with bone-deep conviction . " Your presence here is upsetting Grace , and that 's all that matters . We need to keep her as calm as possible . Is n't that right , Dr. Andrews ? " " Absolutely . " Meredith Andrews walked around Alex and looked down at her patient . " Grace , do you understand me ? " " Yeth . " " Do you want your husband in this room ? " Grace slowly shook her head . " I wan ... my bay ... be . Wan Jamie . " Dr. Andrews looked up at Bill Fennell , who towered over her . " That 's good enough for me . I want you to leave the unit , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes sheened with anger . " I do n't know who you think you are , or who you think you 're talking to , but I give a lot of money to this university . A lot of money . And I  --  " " Do n't make me call security , " Dr. Andrews said quietly , lifting the phone beside Grace 's bed . Bill 's face went white . Alex almost felt sorry for him . The power had clearly passed to Dr. Andrews , but Bill seemed unable to make the decision to leave . He looked , Alex thought , like an actor on a DVD movie after you hit pause . Or that 's what she was thinking when the alarm began to sing . " She 's coding ! " Dr. Andrews shouted through the door , but the shout was unnecessary . Nurses were already running from the station to the cubicle . Alex jumped out of their way , and an instant later Bill did the same . " Cardiac arrest , " Dr. Andrews said , yanking open a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no crash cart ; everything was already here . The quiet cubicle suddenly became a whirlwind of motion , all directed toward a single purpose  --  to sustain the life fast ebbing from the body on the bed . " You need to leave , " said a tall male nurse standing behind Dr. Andrews . " Both of you . " Dr. Andrews glanced up long enough to give Alex a moment of eye contact , then returned to work . Alex backed slowly out of the ICU , watching the final act of her sister 's life unfold without any hope of playing a part herself . Ridiculous regrets about choosing law school over medical school pierced her heart . But what if she had become a doctor ? She would be practicing two thousand miles away from Mississippi , and the result would be the same . Grace 's fate was in God 's hands now , and Alex knew how indifferent those hands could be . She turned away from the cubicle  --  away from Bill Fennell  --  and looked at the nurses ' station , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they focus on all those screens at once ? she wondered , recalling how difficult it was to watch multiple surveillance feeds when the Bureau had a TV rig set up on a static post . As she thought about that , she heard Dr. Andrews say , " I 'm calling it , guys . Time of death , ten twenty-nine P.M. " Shock is a funny thing , Alex thought . Like the day she was shot . Two searing chunks of buckshot and a half pound of glass had blasted through the right side of her face , yet she 'd felt nothing  --  just a wave of heat , as if someone had opened an oven beside her . Time of death , ten twenty-nine P.M .... Something started to let go in Alex 's chest , but before the release , she heard a little boy say , " Hey ! Is my mom in here ? " She turned toward the big wooden door that had brought her to this particular chamber of hell and saw before it a boy about four and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had run all the way from wherever he 'd started . He was trying to look brave , but Alex saw fear in his wide green eyes . " Aunt Alex ? " said Jamie , finally picking her out of the uniformed crowd . Bill 's big voice sounded from behind Alex . " Hello , Son . Where 's Aunt Jean ? " " She 's too slow , " Jamie said angrily . " Come over here , boy . " Alex looked back at her brother-in-law 's stern face , and the thing that had started to let go inside her suddenly ratcheted tight . Without thought she ran to Jamie , swept him into her arms and then out the door , away from this heartrending nightmare . Away from his dying mother . Away from Bill Fennell . Away ... Continues ...
