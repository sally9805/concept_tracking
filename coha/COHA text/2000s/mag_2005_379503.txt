Between 1950 and 2005 , the world 's use of oil grew more than eightfold , bringing global demand to 85 million bbl. of oil per day . Despite that incredible growth , the world 's oil appetite is just getting a head of steam , as countries like China and India finally move toward lifestyles comparable to those of Europe and the U.S. Most oil-forecasting models show demand rising to between 120 million and 130 million bbl. per day by 2025 or 2030 . The only way this demand can be met is for most of the additional supply to come from the Middle East , with Saudi Arabia providing the bulk . <P> Do n't bet on it . <P> For decades , almost all public-policy planners , aided by most oil experts , assumed that the Middle East had vast quantities of proven oil reserves that could be extracted at extremely low cost , thereby enabling oil demand to grow to almost any level . Anchoring that belief is a hope that Saudi Arabia 's oil production can increase from around 9 million bbl. a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bbl. a day by sometime between 2025 and 2030 . <P> After spending more than two years researching my book Twilight in the Desert , I am convinced that it is highly improbable that Middle Eastern oil  --  and particularly Saudi Arabian oil  --  can grow to those far higher levels . Instead there is a risk that Saudi Arabia 's oil output and the rest of the Middle East 's oil supply may start to decline . <P> Saudi Arabia 's specific production risk stems from the fact that almost 90% of its supply comes from only five key but aging giant oil fields . Each of those aging fields is exposed to a potential production decline . The implications of this risk are enormous , since 35 years of intense exploration in the kingdom has unearthed only one significant new oil field , Shaybah . Its peak production is less than 3% of Saudi Arabia 's oil output . <P> The likelihood that Saudi Arabia can increase its output to even 15 million bbl. a day is remote . Even maintaining its current production rate for an indefinite period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abqaiq and Berri fields ( which still make up about 90% of Saudi Arabia 's light crude ) now pump oil from water-injection wells  --  essentially the low-hanging fruit . Once that ends , oil production in those key fields will decline , and the declines could be steep . The two other giant fields producing lesser-quality oil are subject to this same risk . Quantifying the timing and the magnitude of the pending drop is impossible based on the skimpy data Saudi Arabia now discloses . But the risk is real , and the drop could happen soon . <P> The bottom line : the global oil supply has probably peaked . While the world expects to consume 120 million bbl. a day two decades from now , actual supply may be half that rate . This conclusion aptly portrays the potential magnitude of the energy ditch we are now in . It is impossible to calculate the odds of this supply-demand imbalance happening , but prudent planning argues that the world should assume the bleaker scenario . Then it follows that a global plan to use oil more rationally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
