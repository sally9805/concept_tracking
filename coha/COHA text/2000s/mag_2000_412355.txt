Five lightweight rainjackets that will keep you dry and even handle the occasional hailstorm . By Michael Lanza // Rain is a good thing . Without rain , we would n't have our vast forests , and many of our great rivers would turn into wispy runnels of brown water each summer . We would n't have such a rich diversity of plant and animal species . There 's even something aesthetically pleasing , something soul-nourishing about hiking in the rain . Okay , let 's stop being nice and cut to the chase : If you 're a backpacker , rain stinks . No one ever proclaims with joy and zest , " Heading to the mountains this weekend ! Gee , I hope it pours buckets ! " We 've all experienced how time seems to drag like a ship 's anchor when the sky is cryin ' . And anyone who sings in the rain has n't marched for miles with a creek draining off a pack lid down the back of his neck . You ca n't avoid the rain , but what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cope . To help you in this respect , we gathered seven field testers who routinely spend an inordinate amount of time in wet , miserable conditions and asked them to put five rainjackets through the wringer . Our wrinkled-skin warriors traipsed around for 4 months beneath unfriendly skies in New England , the southern Appalachians , and the Northwest . In selecting the test jackets , we established backpacking-specific criteria . We wanted packable , allpurpose , waterproof/breathable shells that wo n't set you back more than $300 . In essence , a rain shell that keeps out the elements , breathes like a bellows , weighs a few ounces , and shrinks down to nothing when you 're through with it . Our field of five garments includes two relatively lightweight jackets best suited to moderate temps ( the Marmot and Helly Hansen ) ; two mountain parkas designed for cooler conditions ( the Bean and Lowe ) ; and one that falls between these two categories ( LaFuma ) . Lastly , because fit looms so large in any evaluation of a jacket 's performance , FINAL GRADE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nothing matches the PreCip in moderate temps . We 'd have to dig deep into the BACKPACKER fieldtest archives to find the last time the least expensive product aced the rest of the competition . " Is that $99 price tag for real ? " John wondered , disbelieving . " It 's the steal of the century , nay , the millennium . " This featherweight 13.5-ounce shell packs up barely bigger than a softball . The pit zips and front mesh pockets vent like open doors in a house . ( " You have a wind tunnel that keeps the air moving inside , " Kelly said . ) Most appealingly , the pit zips open and close easily , unlike jackets with hook-and-loop storm flaps that have to be wrestled open . As for breathability , I found that the jacket breathed well when I needed to cool off . In general , testers felt a bit damp when working hard , and some said they 've worn more breathable shells . But on the good side , the PreCip dried in respectable time . We found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City of Rocks , I hiked in everything from hail to rain showers with strong , cold wind . Roger reported staying " very dry " under the jacket during 5 inches of rain on New Hampshire 's Mt . Cardigan . Janet , on the other hand , hiked through wind-driven rain and got wetter each day as water penetrated her defenses . Most of us liked the fit , citing features like good shoulder articulation and room for layers underneath . I liked being able to roll up my sleeves as if the jacket were a jersey , but Paul and Roger found the sleeves and torso short and snug ; Roger felt rain draining into his pants when he raised his arms . The hood adjusts easily and provides adequate coverage , though it could be a little deeper . Jeb pointed out that the qualities that make the PreCip so packable translate to less warmth when the mercury drops , which means you must have a layer handy to pull on underneath . Paul , Kelly , and I wondered about the longevity of the thin fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Contact : Marmot , ( 707 ) 544-4590 ; www.marmot. com . Reader service #121 . FINAL GRADE : 3.9 L.L. Bean Gore-Tex Mountain Guide Parka A hardy , durable shelf ideal for the coldest and wettest of Mother Nature 's moods . This mountain parka finished a close second to the Marmot PreCip . Janet found the Bean jacket well-suited to " typical New England spring weather  --  temps in the low 30s with 3 days of steady rain . " John stood below a small waterfall belaying an ice-climbing partner with " never a thought of wetness entering , unless I looked up . " Kelly dug trenches in the rain for several hours on a trail project without leakage . And I outlasted steady rain , icy gales , and winddriven snow and ice pellets . This shell can take it . And it can dish it back out-the moisture , that is . In the aforementioned torrent , Janet lived in her Guide Parka and " was never so sweaty that I felt trapped . " Roger noted the inner surface never got excessively wet , thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I skied with a heavy pack without feeling clammy , and the jacket dried almost completely in the time I spent dumping gear and changing into dry boots afterward . Only hot-blooded Jeb found the shell 's respiratory limits ; after a hard hike , a map inside his inner pocket was damp from perspiration . Except for tall Kelly 's pining for slightly more shoulder and hip space in the women 's model , we could speak no evil about fit in the torso and sleeves . Jeb and I did complain about the hood not staying over our foreheads . And Janet and I did n't understand why the pit zips do n't extend below the armpitsa significant shortcoming in the ventilation department . But the rest liked the hood , the hook-andloop closures on the wrist cuffs , and the stiff collar ( it swallows up the hood ) for fending off the elem With its reinforced nylon shoulders and sleeves we were all tempted to agree with Paul 's off chart durability rating of 6 . The flip side of that jacket , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much jacket . Note : As we go to press , we 've just learned that Bean is discontinuing the women 's version of the Mountain Guide Some sizes may still be in stock . Contact : L.L.

FINAL GRADE : 3.4 Lore Alpine Alpine Pro Jacket The Alpine Pro is a tough storm jacket with a great hood best suited to hikers whose perspiration tendencies require breathability . " Between the heavy-duty durable waters ( DWR ) coating , serious storm flaps , and water-resistant zippers , you 'd have to go swimming in this thing for water to get inside , " John said . None of us managed to find conditions soggy enough for dampness to penetrate the Alpine Pro 's defenses  --  except Paul , who had to go swimming in it to prove John correct . While training whitewater guides on Washington 's Wenatchee River-conditions far more extreme than those for which any of our test jackets were designed-Paul marveled that " only a bit of wetness seeped in the lower half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within . The Alpine Pro does n't release body moisture as well as the Marmot or Bean jackets . Roger 's experience was our paradigm : He had to strip the jacket off when moving uphill , and in subfreezing temps he found frost buildup inside . Though we liked the depth of the pit zips-Paul equated them to " airplane hangar doors " - we were n't crazy about the double hookand-loop storm flaps that inhibited easy venting . Ditto for the front zipper and pockets . The Alpine Pro is n't a quick drier , either . That said , we loved the hood . It 's deep , yet eminently adjustable , with a stiff brim that projects far enough to cast a shadow to your chin if the sun comes out . It hugged my face nicely when the wind roared and ice and snow flew horizontally while I was on a solo backcountry ski trip in Yellowstone . Roger sang its praises on a trip in northern Maine that saw 8 inches of snowfall 1 day and - 25F and 50 mph winds another . But as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Napoleon-style , two front pockets ; the arrangement makes you cross your arms to warm your hands . In the fit category , John , Janet , Kelly , and I found the sleeves a bit too long , though the gaping cuffs ' closures did seal up neatly . The women judged the fit billowy overall , while Paul and Roger liked the extra room . The jacket is also stiffer and bulkier than the others in the test .

FINAL GRADE : 3.1 Helly Hansen Willis Jacket Ifyou 're a light sweater who stays on trai4 andyou are n't too rough on your rainwear , the ultralight Willis may do the trick . The Willis is a featherweight ( only 15.5 ounces ) and highly packable jacket for mild temps . None of us detected a single leak through the fabric or waterproof zippers-not even John , after holding it to " a lawn sprinkler pointed dead-center at the pocket zippers . " The only report of a chink in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limp hood brim " for allowing too much windblown snow and rain " to hit my face . " In the all-important breathability department , the Willis left us wanting . While hiking in New Hampshire 's White Mountains , Janet said that the inside of her jacket and her clothes quickly became wet , and " the hood liner often stuck to my skin and hair . " Roger " felt hot and sticky after moderate exertion . " In Idaho 's Sawtooths , John stopped four of us at the top of a steep hill and stuffed a hand in our armpits to compare dampness under various shells . " My Willis felt the wettest , " he reported . Moisture build-up inside has a lot to do with how well the jacket ventilates , and most of us faulted the torso zips , which run from just above the waist to the armpits without extending down the underarm . Other venting limitations : The pit zips are hard to access beneath a backpack ; the front zipper does n't open from the bottom as well as the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janet , John , and Paul did like the roomy fit for layering , but Jeb , Kelly , and I found the Willis almost baggy . Only Roger reported the jacket fitting too tight . Sleeves tended to be long , but there was good shoulder articulation . As for durability , we noticed some torn stitching and damaged drawcords , and wondered about the longevity of the Willis 's light fabric . We 'd recommend it more for three-season trail hiking than heavy off-trail bushwhacking . Contact : Helly Hansen , ( 800 ) 435-5901 ; www.hellyhansen.com . Reader service #124 . FINAL GRADE : 2.7 LaFuma Conway Stretch Gore-Tex Jacket A decent shell that stretches for good freedom of movement , the Conway would be enhanced with some better venting options . Like the other jackets : the Conway kept out rain . Even John , ever determined to unearth leaks , could n't find any wet spots even after wearing it in his shower . From rafting Washington 's rivers to hiking its mountains , Paul hardly noticed the rain . While Janet stayed dry , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DWR treated exterior shell failed to bead up . For breathability , the jacket drew mixed conclusions . Jeb and John gave it a favorable assessment and lauded the mesh lining for keeping skin feeling dry . The rest of us found the Conway hot and sticky . " Tight and clammy , " Janet said . " I got steamy hiking up a slight incline at a moderate pace in drizzle and 50 deg F  --  typical conditions for most backpackers . " We particularly missed pit zips , a feature we consider vital in a backcountry shell , and mesh lining in the chest pockets , which can help with ventilation . The Conway has a two-way front zipper , but that did n't make up for the lack of venting . We 'd also prefer a deeper hood ; the Conway 's shallow headpiece did little to keep rain off faces . Most testers liked the fit overall , though Paul picked nits with the length of the sleeves ( too short ) , and Jeb said the front billowed and got in the way when zipped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch Gore-Tex panels across the shoulders , which improve flexibility noticeably during hiking or skiing .

Some people pack an el-cheapo rain poncho while others swear by their superhigh-tech waterproof/breathable jacket , all of which illustrates an important point : Getting the right shell has as much to do with personal needs and hiking habitats as it does with the quality of a garment . In other words , buying more jacket than you need makes no more sense than buying less jacket than you need . Ask yourself a few questions : What range of temperatures do I normally encounter-rarely below 45F or sometimes below freezing ? Is there a high likelihood you 'll encounter snow and frigid winds , or monsoonlike humidity ? Do you want a jacket strictly for summer and early fall , or for all four seasons ? If you typically hike in mild weather , get a lightweight jacket . That is , a shell that weighs 20 ounces or less , has thin fabric , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold-weather warrior , on the other hand , needs armor-plated fabric , a batten-down-the-hatches hood with good adjustability , and a stiff collar to keep the elements off your neck . If you 're not sure , consider whether you get cold easily or tend to sweat a lot . A cold person 's safe bet is the warmer parka . A hot person will probably be happy most of the time with a lightweight jacket and can handle colder temps by layering underneath the shell . Next , consider your personal physiology . ff you perspire easily , you 'll need pit zips , venting pockets , and a two-way front zipper . If you stay dry no matter how hard you work , skip the bells and whistles to save a few ounces . Also look at how hard you treat your gear : If you like bushwhacking , scrambling , or climbing , look for fabric built to withstand abuse , plus reinforcement panels in high-friction areas like shoulders , elbows , and lower back . Once you make your purchase , the best way to prolong the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the test jackets come with a factory-applied water-repellent finish ( DWR ) that causes rain to bead up on the outer surface . This coating can become compromised by dirt , campfire smoke , even oils from your skin . Washing with a mild detergent and a trip through the drier on low heat often reactivates the beading properties . ( Note : Always check manufacturer recommendations first ; some advise using a nondetergent soap like Nikwax Tech Wash , while others recommend a small amount of powder detergent . ) Eventually , the DWR will wear off you 'll know because the shell will consistently " wet out " or appear to soak up water and it wo n't breathe properly . Some manufacturers recommend certain DWR-restoring products . Gore 's Revivex and Tectron 's Outdoor Fabric Protector performed the best in our review of DWR treatments ( Outfitting April 1998 ) .
