<p> It 's dinner time . Family is at the table . Dad 's special phone rings . <p> The man on the other end of the phone wants to talk sex . Sex with a little girl . Dad gets up from the dinner table and walks away , phone pressed to his ear . <p> This is the front line of the new undercover war on child pornography  --  a place where a West Point graduate with a degree in computer engineering has to step away from his own family 's dinner table and pretend to be a man interested in trading a fictitious daughter for sex . <p> " I use names that mean nothing to me . It 's difficult for me to talk about having sex with a child , so I do n't want to use the name of someone I know , " says the agent , coordinator of the FBI 's Safe Child Task Force in Atlanta , who described the scene at his dinner table . <p> He is among the agents on the forefront of fighting a resurgent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiped out two decades ago , when federal customs agents and postal inspectors cracked down on importing or creating pornographic images of children , leaving collectors with little to trade . <p> Now , the Internet and digital cameras have given the subculture new life . It flourishes in shadowy online chat rooms with nicknames that conceal their true nature , and in brazenly open Web sites that peddle child porn from overseas . And where child molestation once played out behind closed doors , now it often plays out on the Web , for anyone who cares to look . <p> Such was the case , police say , with six men arrested in Gwinnett County this month on charges they raped a 12-year-old girl at Wilbur Caldwell 's home in Duluth . Caldwell posted images of the girl 's abuse and advertisements for men to come have sex with her , police say . <p> And the case of Steven Pease of Alpharetta , who was arrested last week on charges he molested his three daughters , ages 5 , 7 and 12 . Some of the abuse was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took requests for what should be done to the girls . <p> Such cases are almost unbearably common , said Michelle Collins , director of the child exploitation unit of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children . <p> More than 40 percent of the 775 child pornography subjects identified by center analysts were being molested by a parent and the resulting images broadcast to the Web , she said . <p> The Safe Child Task Force is examining Pease 's computer to learn whether he was charging for the shows , and to see if they can track down those who viewed the material . <p> In the wake of these high-profile child molestation cases , the task force  --  formed in 2000 to combat the spread of child pornography  --  opened a door into a world where few people would ever want to venture . <p> The Atlanta Journal-Constitution agreed not to publish the names of task force members and their detailed investigative techniques to avoid compromising ongoing federal investigations . <p> The task force works inside a featureless room off limits even to other FBI agents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must give agents permission to continue what they do every six months . <p> Psychological testing is a way of life . <p> So is the anger caused by seeing so many young children abused . <p> " It enrages me , " says one member of the task force . " But I have to use that rage very precisely to make sure these guys never see the light of day again . " <p> On the wall behind the task force director 's drab cubicle hangs one of his daughter 's drawings , a bright-yellow blob titled " Mashed Potatoes . " <p> Nearby , there 's a sign hanging on the wall that , in any other office , would take on the tone of a joke . Here , you 're not so sure . <p> " DANGER : Many illegal activities in progress . Enter at your own risk . " <p> World of horrors <p> Technically , illegal things are under way here . <p> Undercover investigators with the Safe Child Task Force pose as pedophiles with children to trade . They receive child porn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Internet . <p> At precisely 2:24 p.m. on a recent afternoon , the task force leader sits down at a computer that 's entirely disconnected from the FBI 's government network and calls up a popular peer-to-peer file sharing program , the kind many people use to download music . <p> At 2:26 , using codes and acronyms that would mean something only to pornographers , pedophiles and the police officers who chase them , the agent makes the screen swim with the titles of hardcore files that appear to feature children being molested . <p> Later , he opens a horrifying folder of images . It represents what the task force has collected over years of trolling Web sites and chat rooms and raiding pedophiles ' homes in a seemingly futile effort to stem the tide of child exploitation . <p> Here are little children engaged in every sort of sex imaginable , pleading and with fear in their eyes . There are dated images of naked girls posing , almost naively . And newer , much more graphic photos . <p> Peer-to-peer services are n't the only method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ log on anonymously are a growing problem , and molesters gather in chat rooms on the Web and on lesser-known corners of the Internet . <p> They talk about their desires , trade tips , pictures and videos . <p> " It 's like a support group , " the task force leader says . <p> Computer experts needed <p> Agents use a variety of techniques to check the flow of pornography , from logging into chat rooms and monitoring the conversations to tracking the unique numerical identifiers carried by still images and videos as they criss-cross the Web . <p> One weak spot in the fight on online child pornography involves a shortage of technicians trained to scour computers for traces of illegal files and other clues that can lead them to pornographers and predators . <p> That shortage can have very human consequences . <p> It took investigators in another state six months to review a computer seized in a child molestation investigation , according to Rusty Grant , special agent in charge of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation 's computer unit . <p> When authorities finally reviewed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being molested . Had the computer been reviewed earlier , Grant said , the abuse could have been stopped sooner . <p> Georgia is n't in much better shape , Grant said . <p> Such waits are common here , although his lab tries to give priority to child sex crimes when they come in . <p> The work can take days to complete . Technicians must go through each image on a computer , examining each for evidence of a crime . <p> It 's tedious , and it can take a toll on investigators . The FBI unit has existed for nearly six years . The longest anyone has stayed is three or four . The work is satisfying , but hard to stomach . <p> One agent peels a sheet of lyrics from the wall of his cubicle . It 's the song " Holy Water , " by the country group Big &; Rich . <p> " Someone ran away with her innocence , " the agent reads from the sheet . " A memory she ca n't get out of her head ; I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praying , kneeling at the edge of her bed . " <p> It 's a song he first heard about six months after starting his first child porn case two years ago , one that required him to examine a thousand graphic images as part of an investigation that 's still ongoing . <p> The case left him drained , emotionally distant and withdrawn . <p> One day , he found himself driving down the road , hearing this song on the radio , and breaking down in tears . <p> He credits his wife with helping bring him out of his shell , and now he offers his expertise to parents through his church . He wants to help them , and asks for their help in return . <p> " I want them to pray for me , " he says . " I need that extra shield of protection around me .
