It was Thanksgiving Day and hot , because this was New Orleans ; they were driving uptown to have dinner with strangers . Ella pushed at her loose tooth with the tip of her tongue and fanned her legs with the hem of her velvet dress . On the seat beside her , Benjamin fidgeted with his shirt buttons . He had worn his pilgrim costume , brown shorts and a white shirt and yellow paper buckles taped to his shoes . In the front seat their father drove without a word , while their mother dozed against the window glass . She wore a blue dress and a strand of jade beads and a knit cotton hat beneath which she was bald . <p> Three months earlier Ella 's father had explained what chemotherapy was , and how it would make her mother better . He had even taken Ella to the hospital once when her mother had a treatment . She remembered it like a filmstrip from school , a series of connected images she wished she did n't have to watch : her mother with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bag of orange liquid , her father speaking softly to himself as he paced the room , her mother shaking so hard she had to be tied down . <p> At night Ella and her brother tapped a secret code against the wall that separated their rooms : one knock , I 'm afraid ; two knocks , do n't worry ; three knocks , are you still awake ? ; four , come quick . And then there was the Emergency Signal , a stream of knocks that kept on coming , which meant her brother could hear their mother and father crying in their bedroom . If it went on for more than a minute , Ella would give four knocks , and her brother would run to her room and crawl under the covers . <p> There were changes in the house , healing rituals which required Ella 's mother to go outside and embrace trees or lie facedown on the grass . Sometimes she did a kind of Asian dance that looked like karate . She ate bean paste and Japanese vegetables , or sticky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have dinner with people they had never met , people who ate seaweed and brown rice every day of their lives . <p> They drove through the Garden District , where Spanish moss hung like beards from the trees . Once during Mardi Gras , Ella had ridden a trolley here with her brother and grandmother , down to the French Quarter , where they 'd eaten beignets at Cafe du Monde . She wished she were sitting in one of those wroughtiron chairs and shaking powdered sugar onto a beignet . How much better than to be surrounded by strangers , eating food that tasted like the bottom of the sea . <p> They turned onto a side street , and her father studied the directions . " It should be at the end of this block , " he said . <p> Ella 's mother shifted in her seat . " Where are we ? " she asked , her voice dreamy with painkillers . <p> " Almost there , " said Ella 's father . <p> They pulled to the curb in front of a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vines covered the walls and moss grew thick and green between the roof slates . Under the porte  --  cochere stood a beat-up Honda and a Volkswagen with mismatched side panels . A faded Big Wheel lay on its side on the walk . <p> " Come on , " their father said , and gave them a tired smile . " Time for fun . " He got out of the car and opened the doors for Ella and her mother , sweeping his arm chauffeur-like as they climbed out . <p> Beside the front door was a tarnished doorbell in the shape of a lion 's head . " Push it , " her father said . Ella pushed . A sound like church bells echoed inside the house . <p> Then the door swung open , and there was Mr. Kaplan , a tall man with wiry orange hair and big dry-looking teeth . He shook hands with Ella 's parents , so long and vigorously it seemed to Ella he might as well say congratulations . <p> " And you must be Ben and Ella " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nod . Her brother kicked at the doorjamb . <p> " Well , come on in , " he said . " I have a tree castle out back " <p> Benjamin 's face came up , twisted with skepticism . " A what ? " <p> " The kids are back there . They 'll show you , " he said . <p> " What an interesting foyer , " their mother said . She bent down to look at the brass animals on the floor , a turtle and a jackal and a llama . Next to the animals stood a blue vase full of rusty metal flowers . A crystal chandelier dangled from the ceiling , its arms hung with dozens of God's-eyes and tiny plastic babies from Mardi Gras king cakes . On a low wooden shelf against the wall , pair after pair of canvas sandals and sneakers and Birkenstocks were piled in a heap . A crayoned sign above it said SHOES OFF NOW ! <p> Ella looked down at her feet . She was wearing her new patentleather Mary Janes . <p> " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and touched her shoulder . He stepped out of his own brown loafers and set them on top of the pile . Then he knelt before Ella 's mother and removed her pumps . " Shoes off , " he said to Ella and Ben . <p> " Even me ? " Ben said . He looked down at his paper buckles . <p> Their father took off Ben 's shoes and removed the paper buckles , tape intact . Then he pressed one buckle onto each of Ben 's socks . " There , " he said . <p> Ben looked as if he might cry . <p> " Everyone 's in the kitchen , " Mr. Kaplan said . " We 're all cooking . " <p> " Marvelous , " said Ella 's mother . " We love to cook . " <p> They followed him down a cavern of a hall , its walls decorated with sepia-toned photographs of children and parents , all of them staring stone-faced from their gilt frames . They passed a sweep of stairs , and a room with nothing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting on beds of cloud . <p> " What 's that room ? " Benjamin said . <p> " Meditation room , " Mr. Kaplan said , as if it were as commonplace as a den . <p> The kitchen smelled of roasting squash and baked apples and spices . There was an old brick oven and a stove with so many burners it looked as if it had been stolen from a restaurant . At the kitchen table , men and women with long hair and loose clothes sliced vegetables or stirred things into bowls . Some of them wore knitted hats like her mother , their skin dull-gray , their eyes purple-shaded underneath . To Ella it seemed they could be relatives of her mother 's , shameful cousins recently discovered . <p> A tall woman with a green scarf around her waist came over and embraced Ella 's mother , then bent down to hug Ella and Benjamin . She smelled of smoky perfume . Her wide eyes skewed in different directions , as if she were watching two movies projected into opposite corners of the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " We 're so happy you decided to come , " the woman said . " I 'm Delilah , Eddy 's sister . " <p> " Who 's Eddy ? " said Ben . <p> " Mr. Kaplan , ' their father said . <p> " We use our real names here , " Delilah said . " No one is a mister . " <p> She led their parents over to the long table and put utensils into their hands . Their mother was to mix oats into a pastry crust , and their father to chop carrots , something Ella had never seen him do . He looked around in panic , then hunched over and began cutting a carrot into clumsy pieces . He kept glancing at the man to his left , a bearded man with a shaved head , as if to make sure he was doing it right . <p> Delilah gave Ella and Benjamin hard cookies that tasted like burnt rice . It seemed Ella would have to chew forever . Her loose tooth waggled in its socket . <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's plenty of time to play before dinner . " <p> " What kids ? " Benjamin asked . <p> " You 'll see , " said Delilah . She tilted her head at Ella , one of her eyes moving over Ella 's velvet dress . " Here 's a little trick I learned when I was a girl , " she said . In one swift movement she took the back hem of the dress , brought it up between Ella 's knees , and tucked it into the sash . " Now you 're wearing shorts , " she said . <p> Ella did n't feel like she was wearing shorts . As soon as Delilah turned away , she pulled her skirt out of her sash and let it fall around her legs . <p> The wooden deck outside was cluttered with Tinkertoys and clay flowerpots and Little Golden Books . Ella heard children screaming and laughing nearby . As she and Benjamin moved to the edge of the deck , there was a rustle in the bushes , and a skinny boy leaped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there breathing hard , his hair full of leaves , his chest bare . " You 're on duty , " he said . <p> " Me ? " Benjamin said . <p> " Yes , you , " the boy said . " Both of you . " He motioned them off the porch with his arrow and took them around the side of the house . There , built into the side of a sprawling oak , was the biggest , most sophisticated treehouse Ella had ever seen . There were tiny rooms of sagging plywood , and rope ladders hanging down from doors , and a telescope and a fireman 's pole and a red net full of leaves . From one wide platform-almost as high as the top of the house-it seemed you could jump down onto a huge trampoline . Even higher was a kind of crow's-nest , a little circular platform built around the trunk . A red-painted sign on the railing read " DAGNER ! " Ella could hear the other children screaming , but she could n't see them . A collie dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Take off your socks ! That 's an order , " the skinny boy said . Benjamin glanced at Ella as if to ask if this were okay . Ella shrugged . It seemed ridiculous to walk around outside in socks . She bent and peeled off her anklets . Benjamin carefully removed his pilgrim buckles and put them in his pocket , then sat down and took off his socks . The skinny boy grabbed the socks from their hands and tucked them into the waistband of his shorts . <p> The mud was thick and cold between Ella 's toes , and pecan shells bit her feet as the boy herded them toward the treehouse . He prodded Ella toward a ladder of prickly-looking rope . When she stepped onto the first rung , the ladder swung toward the tree and her toes banged against the trunk . The skinny boy laughed . <p> " Go on , " he said . " Hurry up . And no whining . " <p> The rope burned her hands and feet as she ascended . The ladder seemed to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buck and sway as they climbed . At the top there was a small square opening , and Ella thrust both her arms inside and pulled herself into a dark coop . As she stood , her head knocked against something dangling from the ceiling on a length of string . It was a bird 's skull , no bigger than a walnut . Dozens of others hung from the ceiling around her . Benjamin huddled at her side . <p> " Sick , " he said . <p> " Do n't look , " Ella said . <p> The suction-cup arrow came up through the hole in the floor . <p> " Keep going , " said the boy . " You 're not there yet . " <p> " Go where ? " Ella said . <p> " Through the wall . " <p> Ella brushed the skulls out of her way and leveled her shoulder against one of the walls . It creaked open like a door . Outside , a tree limb as thick as her torso extended up to another plywood box , this one much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crawled upward . Benjamin followed . <p> Apparently this was the hostage room . Four kids stood in the semi-darkness , wide-eyed and still as sculptures , each bound at the ankles and wrists with vine handcuffs . Two of the kids , a boy and a girl , were so skinny that Ella could see the outlines of bones in their arms and legs . Their hair was patchy and ragged , their eyes black and almond-shaped . In the corner , a white-haired boy in purple overalls whimpered softly to himself . And at the center of the room a girl Benjamin 's age stood tied to the tree trunk with brown string . She had the same wild gray eyes and leafy hair as the boy with the arrows . <p> " It 's mine , it 's my treehouse " she said as Ella stared at her . <p> " Is Mr. Kaplan your dad ? " Benjamin said . <p> " My dat-tee , " the girl corrected him . <p> " Where 's your mom ? " <p> " She died " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benjamin sucked in his breath and glanced at Ella . <p> Ella wanted to hit this girl . She bent down close to the girl 's face , making her eyes small and mean . " If this is so your treehouse , " Ella said , " then how come you 're tied up ? " <p> " It 's jail , " the girl spat . " In jail you get tied up . " <p> " We could untie you , " said Benjamin . He tugged at one of her bonds . <p> The girl opened her mouth and let out a scream so shrill Ella 's eardrums buzzed . Once , as her father had pulled into the driveway at night , he had trapped a rabbit by the leg beneath the wheel of his car ; the rabbit had made a sound like that . Benjamin dropped the string and moved against Ella , and the children with ragged hair laughed and jumped on the platform until it crackled and groaned . The boy in purple overalls cried in his corner . <p> Benjamin put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand it here , " he whispered . <p> There was a scuffle at the door , and the skinny boy stepped into the hostage room . " All right , " he said . " Who gets killed ? " <p> " Kill those kids , Peter , " the girl said , pointing to Benjamin and Ella . <p> " Us ? " Benjamin said . <p> " Who do you think ? " said the boy . <p> He poked them in the back with his suction-cup arrow and moved them toward the tree trunk , where rough boards formed a ladder to the next level . Ella and Benjamin climbed until they had reached a narrow platform , and then Peter pushed them to the edge . Ella looked down at the trampoline . It was a longer drop than the high dive at the public pool . She looked over her shoulder , and Peter glared at her . Down below the collie barked and barked , his black nose pointed up at them . <p> Benjamin took Ella 's hand and closed his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumbled forward into space . <p> There was a moment of terrifying emptiness , nothing but air beneath Ella 's feet . She could hear the collie 's bark getting closer as she fell . She slammed into the trampoline knees first , then flew , shrieking , back up into the air . When she hit the trampoline a second time , Benjamin 's head knocked against her chin . He stood up rubbing his head , and Ella tasted salt in her mouth . Her loose tooth had slipped its roots . She spit it into her palm and studied its jagged edge . <p> " Move , " Peter called from above . The boy in purple overalls was just climbing up onto the platform . Peter pulled him forward until his toes curled over the edge . <p> " I lost my tooth ! " Ella yelled . <p> " Get off ! " <p> Benjamin scrambled off the trampoline . Ella crawled to the edge , the tooth gleaming and red-rimmed between her fingers , and then the trampoline lurched with the weight of the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and into the bushes , too small to make a sound when it hit . <p> When she burst into the house crying , blood streaming from her mouth , the long-haired men and women dropped their mixing spoons and went to her . She twisted away from them , looking frantically for her mother and father , but they were nowhere to be seen . Her throat ached with crying . There was no way to explain that she was n't hurt , that she was upset because her tooth was gone , and because everything about that house made her want to run away and hide . The adults , their faces creased with worry , pulled her to the sink and held her mouth open . The woman with skewed eyes , Delilah , pressed a tissue against the space where her tooth had been . Ella could smell onion and apples on her hands . <p> " The time was right , " she said . " The new tooth 's already coming in . " <p> " Whose is she ? " one of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's parents . It was strange to hear those familiar words , Ann and Gary , in the mouths of these long-haired strangers . <p> " Your mother is upstairs , " Delilah said , her eyes swiveling toward some distant hidden room . " She felt a little swimmy  --  headed . Your dad just brought her some special tea . Maybe we should let her rest , hm ? " <p> Ella slipped out from beneath Delilah 's hand and ran to the hall , remembering the stairway she 'd seen earlier . There it was before her , a curve of glossy steps leading to nowhere she knew . Her mother 's cough drifted down from one of the bedroom doors . Ella put a foot onto the first stair , feeling the eyes of the adults on her back . No one said anything to stop her . After a moment , she began to climb . <p> In the upstairs hallway , toys and kids ' shoes lay strewn across the floor , and crumpled pants and shirts and dresses lay in a musty-smelling heap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record player sat in the middle of the hall , its vacant turntable spinning . Ella stepped over the cord and went into the first room , a small room with a sleeping bag on the bare mattress ticking . In a cage on the nightstand , a white rat scrabbled at a cardboard tube . A finger-painted sign above the bed said CLARIES ROOM . Her mother 's cough rose again from down the hall , and she turned and ran toward the sound . <p> In a room whose blue walls and curtains made everything look as if it were underwater , her mother lay pale and coughing on a bed piled high with pillows . Her father sat on the edge of the bed , his hands raised in the air , thumbs hooked together and palms spread wide . For a moment Ella had no idea what he was doing . Then she saw the shadow of her father 's hands against the wall , in the light of a blue-shaded lamp . A shock of relief went through her . <p> " Tweet , tweet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father said . " A birdie . " <p> Ella 's mother turned toward her and smiled , more awake , more like her real self than earlier . " Do another one , Gary , " she said . <p> Ella 's father twisted his hands into a new shape in the air . <p> " A dog ? " Ella said . <p> " A fish ! " said her mother . <p> " No , " he said , and adjusted his hands . " It 's a horsie , see ? " <p> " A horsie ? " said Ella 's mother . " With fins ? " <p> That made Ella laugh a little . <p> " Hey ; ' " her mother said . " Come here , you . Smile again . " <p> Ella did as she was told . <p> " What 's that ? You lost your tooth ! " <p> " It 's gone , " Ella said . She climbed onto the bed to explain , but as she flopped down on the mattress her mother 's face contracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " her mother said . She touched the place where her surgery had been . <p> Ella 's father gave her a stern look and lifted her off the bed . " Your mom 's sleepy , " he said . " You should run back downstairs now . <p> " She 's always sleepy , " Ella said , looking down at her muddy feet . She thought of her tooth lying out in the weeds , and how she 'd have nothing to put under her pillow for the tooth fairy . <p> Her mother began to cry . <p> Ella 's father went to the window and stared down into the yard , his breath fogging the glass . " Go ahead , Ella , " he said . " We just need a few minutes . " <p> " My tooth , " Ella said . She knew she should leave , but could n't . <p> " It 'll grow back bigger and stronger , " her father said . <p> She could see he did n't understand what had happened . If only her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blue light her mother looked cold and far away , pressed under the weight of tons of water . <p> " I 'll be down soon , " her mother said , sniffling . " Go out and play . " <p> Ella opened her mouth to form some protest , but no words came out . <p> " Go on , now , " her father said . <p> " It fell in a bush ! " she wailed , then turned and ran downstairs . <p> The other children had come in by then . Her brother stood in line at the downstairs bathroom to wash before dinner , comparing fingernail dirt with the boy in purple overalls . Hands deep in the pockets of her velvet dress , Ella wandered through the echoing hall into a room lined from floor to ceiling with books . Many of the titles were in other languages , some even written in different alphabets . She recognized D'Aulaire 's Book of Greek Myths and The Riverside Shakespeare and Grimm 's Fairy Tales . Scattered around on small tables and decorative stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panther  --  man . On one table sat an Egyptian beetle made of milky-green stone , and beside him a real beetle , shiny as metal , who flew at Ella 's face when she reached to touch his shell . She batted him away with the back of her hand . <p> And then , just above where the beetle had fallen , Ella saw a shelf without any books at all . It was low , the height of her knees , with a frayed blue scarf pinned against its back wall . Burnt-down candles stood on either side of a black lacquer box , and on top of this box stood a glass filled with red water . <p> Ella reached for the glass , and someone behind her screamed . <p> She turned around . Clarie stood in the doorway , dress unbuttoned at one shoulder , face smeared with mud . <p> " Do n't touch that , " she said . <p> Ella took a step back . " I was n't going to . ' <p> Clarie 's eyes seemed to ignite as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She held it near a lamp , so the light shone through it and cast a red oval upon the wall . <p> " It 's my mother , " she said . <p> For dinner there was a roasted dome of something that looked like meat but was n't . It was springy and steaming , and when Mr. Kaplan cut it open , Ella could see that it was stuffed with rice and yams . Benjamin tried to hide under the table , but their father pulled him up by the arms and set him in his place . He prodded his wedge of roast until it slid onto the tablecloth . Then he began to cry quietly . <p> " The kids are n't vegetarian , " their father said , in apology to the men and women at the table . He picked up the slice of roast with his fingers and put it back on Ben 's plate . The other men and women held their forks motionless above their own plates , looking at Ella 's mother and father with pity . <p> " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called seitan . Wheat gluten . The other kids love it . " <p> The boy and girl with almond-shaped eyes and ragged hair stopped in mid-chew . The girl looked at Benjamin and narrowed her eyes . <p> " I do n't eat gluten , " Benjamin said . <p> " Come on , now " , their father said . " It 's great . " <p> Ella 's mother pressed her fingers against her temples . She had n't touched her own dinner . Ella , sitting beside her , took a bite of wheat gluten . It was almost like meat , firm and savory , and the stuffing was flavored with forest-smelling spices . As she glanced around the table , she thought of the picture of the First Thanksgiving on the bulletin board at school : the smiling Pilgrims eating turkey and squash , the stern-faced Native Americans looking as if they knew the worst was yet to come . Who among them that night were the Native Americans ? Who were the Pilgrims ? The dark old house was like a wilderness around them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I jumped on the trampoline " said the boy with ragged hair , pulling on the sleeve of the woman next to him . " That boy did a flip . " He pointed at Peter , who was smashing rice against his plate with his thumb . " He tied his sister to the tree . " <p> Mr. Kaplan set down his fork . He looked sideways at Peter , his mouth pressed into a stern line . " I told you never to do that again " he said . He sounded angry , but his voice was quiet , almost a whisper . <p> " She made me ! " Peter said , and plunged a spoon into his baked squash . <p> Mr. Kaplan 's eyes went glossy and faraway . He stared off at the blank wall above Ella 's mother 's head , drifting away from the noise and chatter of the dinner table . Next to him Delilah shuttled her mismatched eyes back and forth . Ella 's mother straightened in her chair . <p> " Ed " she called softly . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tell us about your tai chi class . " <p> " What " he said . <p> " Your tai chi class . ' <p> " You know , I do n't really want to talk right now , " he said . He pushed back his chair and went into the kitchen . There was the sound of water , and then the clink of dishes in the sink . Delilah shook her head . The other adults looked down at their plates . Ella 's mother wiped the corners of her mouth with her napkin and crossed her arms over her chest . <p> " Does anyone want more rice ? " Ella 's father asked . <p> " I think we 're all thinking about Lena " said the man with the shaved head . <p> I know I am , " said Delilah . <p> " Infinity to infinity , " said the man . " Dust into star . " <p> The men and women looked at each other , their eyes carrying some message Ella could n't understand . They clasped each other 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " they repeated . " Dust into star . " <p> " Matter into energy , " said the man . " Identity into oneness . ' <p> " Matter into energy , " everyone said . Ella glanced at her father , whose jaw was set hard , unmoving . Her mother 's lips formed the words , but no sound came out . Ella thought of the usual Thanksgivings at her uncle Bon 's , where everyone talked and laughed at the table and they ate turkey and dressing and sweet potatoes with marshmallows melted on top . She closed her eyes and held her breath , filling her chest with a tightness that felt like magic power . If she tried hard enough could she transport them all , her mother and father , Benjamin and herself , to that other time ? She held her breath until it seemed she would explode , then let it out in a rush . She opened her eyes . Nothing had changed . Peter kicked the table leg , and the collie , crouched beside Clarie 's chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his collar , her knuckles bloodless as stones . <p> Mr. Kaplan returned with a platter of baked apples . He cleared his throat , and everyone turned to look at him . " Guess what we forgot , " he said . " I spent nearly an hour peeling these things . " He held the platter aloft , waiting . <p> " Who wants some nice baked apples ? " he said . " Baked apples . I peeled them . ' <p> No one said a word . <p> After dinner the adults drifted into the room with the straw mats and Indian goddesses . Ella understood that the children were not invited , but she lingered in the doorway to see what would happen . Mr. Kaplan bent over a tiny brass dish and held a match to a black cone . A wisp of smoke curled toward the ceiling , and after a moment Ella smelled a dusty , flowery scent . Her mother and father and the rest of the adults sat cross-legged on the floor , not touching each other . A low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and substance . Ella saw her father raise an eyebrow at her mother , as if to ask if these people were serious . But her mother 's shoulders were bent in meditation , her mouth open with the drone of the mantra , and Ella 's father sighed and let his head fall forward . <p> Someone pinched Ella 's shoulder , and she turned around . Peter stood behind her , his eyes narrow . " Come on , " he said . " You 're supposed to help clean up . " <p> In the kitchen the children stacked dirty dishes on the counter and ran water in the sink . The boy and girl with almond eyes climbed up onto a wide wooden stepstool and began to scrub dishes . Peter scraped all the scraps into an aluminum pan and gave it to Clarie , who set it on the floor near the dog 's water dish . The collie fell at the leftover food with sounds that made Ella sick to her stomach . Clarie stood next to him and stroked his tail . <p> Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . " Somebody forgot this under the table " he said . <p> Again there was the dying-rabbit screech . Clarie batted her palms against the sides of her head . " No ! " she shrieked . " Put it down ! " <p> Benjamin 's eyes went wide , and he set the glass on the kitchen counter . " I do n't want it , " he said . <p> The boy in purple overalls squinted at the glass . " Looks like Kool-Aid " he said . <p> " She gets all crazy , " said Peter . " Watch . ' Peter lifted the glass high into the air , and Clarie ran toward him . " You ca n't have it , " he said . <p> Clarie jumped up and down in fury , her hands flapping like limp rags . Her mouth opened , but no sound came out . Then she curled her fingers into claws and scratched at Peter 's arms and chest until he twisted away . He ran across the kitchen and onto the deck , holding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screaming . <p> The ragged-haired brother and sister looked at each other , arms gloved in white bubbles . In one quick movement they were off the stool , shaking suds around the kitchen . " Come on ! " said the boy . " Let 's go watch ! " <p> Benjamin grabbed Ella 's hand and pulled her toward the screen door . The children pushed out onto the deck and then ran toward the tree castle , where Clarie and her brother were climbing the first rope ladder . It was dark now , and floodlights on the roof of the house illuminated the entire castle , its rooms silver-gray and ghostly , its ropes and nets swaying in a rising breeze . The children gathered on the grass near the trampoline . <p> Peter held the glass as he climbed , the red water sloshing against its sides . " Come and get it , " he crooned . He reached the first room , and they heard the wall-door scrape against the trunk as he pushed it open . Then he moved out onto the oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the zoo . He might as well have had a tail . <p> Clarie crawled behind him , her hands scrabbling at the bark . Peter howled at the sky as he reached the hostage room . Benjamin moved toward Ella and pressed his head against her arm . " I want to go home , " he said . <p> " Shh , " Ella said . " We ca n't . ' <p> High above , Peter climbed onto the platform from which they had jumped earlier . Still holding the glass , he pulled himself up the tree trunk to the crow's-nest . High up on that small , railed platform , where the tree branches became thin and sparse , he stopped . Below him Clarie scrambled onto the jumping platform . She looked out across the yard as if unsure of where he had gone . " Up here " Peter said , holding the glass high . <p> Ella could hear Clarie grunting as she pulled herself up into the crow's-nest . She stood and reached for the glass , her face a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crow's-nest platform . <p> " Give it ! " she cried again . <p> Peter stood looking at her for a moment in the dark . " You really want it ? " <p> " Peter ! " <p> He swept the glass through the air . The water flew out in an arc , ruby-colored against the glare of the floodlights . Clarie leaned out as if to catch it between her fingers , and with a splintering crack she broke through the railing . Her dress fluttered silently as she fell , and her white hands grasped at the air . There was a quiet instant , the soft sound of water falling on grass . Then , with a shock Ella felt in the soles of her feet , Clarie hit the ground . The girl with the ragged hair screamed . <p> Clarie lay beside the trampoline , still as sleep , her neck bent at an impossible angle . Ella wanted to look away , but could n't . The other children , even Benjamin , moved to where Clarie lay and circled around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slid down the fireman 's pole and stumbled across the lawn toward his sister . He pushed Benjamin aside . With one toe he nudged Clarie 's shoulder , then knelt and rolled her over . A bare bone glistened from her wrist . The boy in purple overalls threw up onto the grass . <p> Ella turned and ran toward the house . She banged the screen door open and skidded across the kitchen floor into the hall . At the doorway of the meditation room she stopped , breathing hard . The adults sat just as she had left them , eyes closed , mouths open slightly , their sound beating like a living thing , their thumbs and forefingers circled into perfect O 's . She could smell the heat of them rising in the room and mingling with the scent of the incense . Her father 's chin rested on his chest as if he had fallen asleep . Beside him her mother looked drained of blood , her skin so white she seemed almost holy . <p> " Mom , " Ella whispered . " Mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . For a moment she seemed between two worlds , her eyes unfocused and distant . Then she blinked and looked at Ella . She shook her head no . <p> " Please , " Ella said , but her mother closed her eyes again . Ella stood there for a long time watching her , but she did n't move or speak . Finally Ella turned and went back outside . <p> By the time she reached the tree castle , Peter had dragged Clarie halfway across the lawn . He turned his eyes on Ella , and she stared back at him . The sound of the mantra continued unbroken from the house . Peter hoisted Clarie again under the arms and dragged her to the bushes , her bare feet bumping over the grass . Then he rolled her over until she was hidden in shadow . He pulled her dress down so it covered her thighs , and turned her head toward the fence that bordered the backyard . <p> " Get some leaves and stuff , " he said . " We have to cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benjamin 's hand , but he pulled away from her and wandered across the lawn , pulling up handfuls of grass . She watched the children pick up twigs , Spanish moss , leaves , anything they could find . The boy in purple overalls gathered cedar bark from a flower bed , and Peter dragged fallen branches out of the underbrush near the fence . They scattered everything they found over Clarie 's body . In five minutes they had covered her entirely . <p> " Go back inside , " Peter said . " If anyone cries or says anything , I 'll kill them . ' <p> Ella turned to go , and that was when she saw her tooth , a tiny white pebble in the weeds . She picked it up and rubbed it clean . Then she knelt beside Clarie , clearing away moss and leaves until she found Clarie 's hand . She dropped the tooth into the palm and closed the fingers around it . A shiver spread through her chest , and she covered the hand again . Then she put her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Drawn by the sound of the chanting , they wandered into the hall . All around them hung the yellow photographs , the stony men and women and children looking down at them with sad and knowing eyes . In an oval of black velvet , one girl in a white dress held the string of a wooden duck , her lips open as if she were about to speak . Her eyes had the wildness of Clarie 's eyes , her legs the same bowed curve . <p> At last there was a rustle from the meditation room , and the adults drifted out into the hall . They blinked at the light and rubbed their elbows and knees . Ella 's mother and father linked arms and moved toward their children . Benjamin gave a hiccup . His eyes looked strange , the pupils huge , the whites flat and dry . Their mother noticed right away . " We 'd better get going , ' she said to Ella 's father . " Ben 's tired . " <p> She went into the foyer and pulled their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around in bewilderment , as if he could not believe people were leaving . He patted Benjamin on the head and asked Ella 's mother if she wanted to take some leftover food . Ella 's mother shook her head no . Her father thanked Mr. Kaplan for his hospitality . Somewhere toward the back of the house , the dog began to bark , a crazy , high-pitched bark , as if the world were ending . Ella pulled Benjamin through the front door , barefoot , and her parents followed them to the car . <p> All the way past the rows of live oaks , past the cemetery where the little tombs stood like grounded boats , past the low flat shotgun houses with their flaking roofs , Benjamin sat rigid on the back seat and cried without a sound . Ella felt the sobs leaving his chest in waves of hot air . She closed her eyes and followed the car in her mind down the streets that led to their house , until it seemed they had driven past their house long ago and were moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they would fall asleep thinking of dark forests and wake to the lives of strangers . <p> Author Affiliation
