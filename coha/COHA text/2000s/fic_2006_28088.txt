Chapter One Kai Ford stuck his surfboard into the sand , ran full speed into the ocean and dove into a wave . The sound of rushing water filled his ears . He broke the surface , tasting salt , and whipped his blond hair out of his eyes with a toss of his head . Then he scanned the ocean horizon What he saw made him grin . Good-sized waves were rolling in one after another , like lines of soldiers : marching toward shore . Time to rock and roll ! He splashed out of the water and crossed the hot sand to his surfboard . The board was a beauty . At seven feet long , it was known as a shortboard ? the best length for doing tight maneuvers on a wave . It was made of fiberglass , foam , and balsa wood . Except for the black rubber traction pad near the tail , the deck was covered with bold graphics in neon colors . The underside was glossy white and sported three curved , triangular fins at the tail . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one end-was attached to the tail . When Kai reached his board , he secured the strap around his ankle . Then he picked up his board and headed back into the ocean . He floated the shortboard in front of him , pushing it along until the water reached his waist . With one smooth motion , he slid facedown onto the center ofthe deck He pulled his arms through the water in even strokes , paddling away from shore . Kai was as comfortable in the sea as he was in his own bed . He 'd grown up playing in the sand and surf of this stretch of southern California beach . Kai 's father had once been a professional surfer , and he made sure that his son respected the awesome and unpredictable power of the sea . When Kai showed an interest in surfing , his dad had taught him the rules of safety before they even began with the basics of the sport . That was four years earlier , when Kai was ten . Since then , he had become as confident on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snowboards . He could n't imagine a life without surfing-and hoped he 'd never have to . Kai continued to pull himself along through the water . He was n't alone . Eleven other people were out surfing . Some sat on their boards , watching for a good wave . Others , like Kai , were paddling out to join the lineup-the place where surfers waited their turn to surf . Only two people were actually standing on their boards and slicing their way back toward shore . Kai reached the lineup and sat up . As he bobbed , on the waves , a cool breeze blew across his face , arms , and chest . He adjusted the neck of his long-sleeved rash guard shirt . He was glad he 'd decided to wear the shirt instead of going bare chested . Not only did the stretchy fabric keep his chest from being scraped by the board , it kept him warm ! Kai looked out , to sea and spotted , a decent swell He glanced around . No one else was making a move to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay down on his board and stroked hard to stay ahead of the wave . Then he felt it the moment the wave surged beneath him and started pushing him forward . Now ! instinct told him . In , one explosive move , be shot from a prone to a standing position . His stance was practiced and sure : feet shoulder width apart , left foot forward , right foot planted on the traction pad , and knees bent . He stretched his arms out and leaned forward for balance . He 'd caught the peak of the wave perfectly . It was a " left " a wave that broke from his left side toward right . He rode the swell frontsidem , with the white water boiling at his back and the crest rounding in front of him . The water beneath the board was like a living thing , rippling and strong. , He pumped the board , pushing . It up and down with his feet , hoping to get enough speed to reverse direction and catch some air . When he did n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bailed when the water was a few feet deep . He pulled on the leash to bring the board back then returned to the lineup . When he got there ; Kai saw Vaughn , a boy he knew from school . Vaughn was with another , boy who looked older and wore tinted swim goggles . The other boy looked vaguely familiar , but with those goggles , Kai could n't place him . " Hey , Vaughn , how 're you . doing ? " he called , raising a hand in greeting . Vaughn returned the wave . Kai paddled closer to them . " What 's up , Kai ? " Vaughn said . " Hopefully me , on my board-and soon ! " Kai replied with a grin . Vaughn laughed . " Yeah , I 'm hoping to get in a few good runs , too . " He introduced the other boy . " Kai , this is my cousin , Roger . He 's visiting for the weekend . " Roger nodded then turned back toward where the waves were forming . Kai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he 'd seen Roger somewhere before . He decided to satisfy his curiosity . " You look kind of familiar , " be said to Roger . " You ever surf here before ? " " No , " Roger muttered . " Roger usually rides , farther up the coast , " Vaughn added hurriedly . " Oh yeah ? " Kai said with interest . " I 've surfed some places up there , too I bet that 's where I saw you . " " Doubt it ' " . Roger said . " I surf at a private beach . " Kai looked excited . " But I still could have seen you there ! My dad took me to a private beach up the coast last year . The waves were killer ! " He smiled ruefully . " Unfortunately , the rocks under the waves were killer , too . I rolled over one that , cut my leg something fierce . See ? " He pointed to a three-inch-long , jagged ; white scar on his left thigh . " I almost passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a face . " Gross . Do n't tell me you kept . surfing ! " " I wanted to ; but my dad made me go to the first aid station By the time I got it fixed up , we had to leave , " Kai said . " How come ? " Vaughn asked curiously . " The beach was being dosed down so some movie company could shoot a surfing scene that afternoon . " Kai rolled his eyes . " Someone told me the star of the movie was afraid he 'd be mobbed by fans . Talk about ego , huh ? " Kai expected Vaughn to agree with him about how silly movie stars could be . Instead , Vaughn glanced at his cousin then dropped his gaze to the water . Roger lifted his goggles and fixed Kai with a cold stare . ' What do you know about it ? " the older boy said . " Maybe the guy just wanted a little privacy . I mean , I bet if you 're an actor you get recognized all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's all you want . " He fit the goggles back in place , spun his board , and paddled furiously away to catch the next wave . Kai stared after him open-mouthed . He 'd finally realized where he 'd seen Roger before .
