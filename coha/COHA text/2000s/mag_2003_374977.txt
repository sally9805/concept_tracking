BAGHDAD SIMON ROBINSON <P> It 's not easy being the freeloading , oversexed , overlooked scion of an Iraqi dictator . Consider Uday Hussein , 39 , who in 1990 wrote to an uncle , " It is difficult being in the family of Hussein . People want to kill us . " That quite possibly includes the people who looted his lavish three-story riverside home down to its marble walls . The looters took everything they could , including fuses from the fuse boxes . But they left documents that , as I learned during a walk-through of the building late last week , paint a colorful portrait of the unhappy eldest son of Saddam , who has n't been seen since reportedly entering the restaurant obliterated by U.S. bombs in the al-Mansur neighborhood . <P> The palace , in the tony Baghdad suburb of Karada , was not Uday 's main residence but rather a safe house in which Uday could hide out , as well as , according to a neighbor , a " love nest " to which he would bring his many girlfriends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him fishing with friends , riding a motorbike in a black leather jacket , posing with pet lions and hanging out in shorts and a cowboy hat . <P> Many of the writings Uday left behind are mundane , like a few cards from his handwritten video-collection catalog . The Ls include License to Kill ( two copies ) , Like Father Like Son and Loose Cannons . But some are significant . An official letter signed by Uday and countersigned by seven witnesses , for example , says that well-known opposition Shi'ite leader Thafer Mohammed Jaber was captured on Sept. 3 , 1995 , and was being kept in one of Saddam 's palaces . Jaber , say local Iraqis , has not been heard from since . In a 1990 letter , Uday reveals that his father plans to create a greater Iraq that includes Kuwait , Palestine and Arabstan , a region of Iran historically controlled by Baghdad . The note says Saddam is beginning with the easiest  --  Kuwait . And then there is Uday 's university transcript from 1988 , the year he was awarded a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a class of 174 students , " the transcript reads before detailing his grades : excellent in every subject , except Physical Training and First Aid , in which he was satisfactory , the highest grades offered for such courses . <P> Although shot in an ambush in 1996 , an attack that left him walking with a cane , Uday loved fast cars and faster living . In 1989 , documents show , he bought a red Lamborghini Countach from a Kuwaiti dealer and sent a letter asking about a Ferrari that turned up in Jordan . " Is it still there ? " he wanted to know . Neighbors say looters carried away bottles of Scotch and wine , but they left receipts from Uday 's 1989 New Year 's party , which seem to confirm he liked a tipple . The revelers downed 12 bottles of gin and 11 cases of beer , plus vodka , champagne and Pepsi . <P> Uday 's expensive tastes were n't confined to cars and booze . A 1980 certificate from a Swiss dealer indicates that Uday owned a solid-gold watch with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a problem : the charred corners of $100 and $50 bills litter the house . " He used to light cigars with them , " says a neighbor.
