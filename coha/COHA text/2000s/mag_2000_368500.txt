But 85 years later , the Greek Revival mansion in Marshfield , Mo. , was about to be condemned when Michaelene and Larry Stevens bought it . Restored to its previous grandeur , Dickey House is now a retreat where guests can eat pumpkin pancakes with cider syrup and watch doves fly about a private aviary . <P> Set on two acres filled with looming oak trees , flower gardens , a fountain and a gazebo , Dickey House combines the convenience of a hotel with the intimacy of a B and B. The three rooms in the mansion and four suites in cottages on the grounds are all equipped with private bath , TV and VCR , and are decorated with elegant Victorian antiques . <P> There 's fun to be had outside the grounds too . Local attractions include antiques shops , wineries , a replica of the Hubble Space Telescope and a regular round of arts festivals . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour away , bills itself as the " live-entertainment capital of the world .
