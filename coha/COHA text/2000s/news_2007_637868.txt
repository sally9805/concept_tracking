<p> A bill in Congress would increase the amount of money seniors can borrow when they take out a federally insured reverse mortgage . <p> The increase would be good for people in the Bay Area and other high-cost markets who want to take as much equity as possible out of their homes . But it also would increase the already stiff fees for everyone in high-cost areas , regardless of how much money they borrow . <p> A reverse mortgage lets cash-strapped seniors 62 or older borrow against their home equity without making monthly payments . Interest costs are added to the principal . The loan balance , including principal and accrued interest , does n't have to be repaid until the borrower dies , sells the house or moves out of it for more than 12 months . <p> Homeowners can get their money in a lump sum , in a line of credit they can tap into as needed , or in monthly payments for either a set number of years or for life . The line of credit is the most popular option . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of the home will satisfy the loan . Even if the home 's value falls below the loan balance , the lender can not come after the borrower 's other assets . <p> A reverse mortgage must be the first and only mortgage on your property . However , you can refinance a conventional mortgage with a reverse mortgage . <p> Originally , reverse mortgages were intended to help seniors who had paid off their mortgage raise cash for living expenses or medical bills without selling their homes . <p> But many people who have refinanced their homes are reaching retirement age with a mortgage payment and no paycheck . Some are refinancing with a reverse mortgage , thus eliminating their monthly payment . <p> Bronwyn Belling , a reverse mortgage specialist with the AARP Foundation , calls this " a phenomenon that was not anticipated . " <p> It is believed to be fueling the rapid growth in reverse mortgages . <p> All reverse mortgages are made by private lenders . The vast majority are insured by the Federal Housing Administration , part of the Department of Housing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conversion Mortgages . <p> With an insured loan , the amount you can borrow is based on your age ( the older you are , the more you can borrow ) , the interest rate ( the lower the rate , the more you can borrow ) and the appraised value of your house . <p> In the formula , the appraised value is capped at 95 percent of the median home price in your metropolitan area , but it ca n't exceed $362,790 . <p> That maximum applies to the appraised value of the home , not the loan amount . The loan is always smaller because it is reduced by the age and interest rate factors . <p> For example , a 65-year-old in the San Francisco metropolitan area could borrow no more than $172,968 with a monthly adjusting FHA reverse mortgage . An 80-year-old could borrow up to $237,326 . <p> The bill , HR1852 , would cap the appraised value at a single nationwide limit equal to the Fannie Mae maximum for conforming mortgages . Today that limit is $417,000 everywhere except in Alaska and Hawaii , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $417,000 would let people in the Bay Area and other high-priced areas borrow more . How much more depends on their age and interest rates . According to one calculation supplied by HUD , a 74-year-old in San Francisco could borrow about 15 percent more if the bill passed . <p> That would be great for people who want to borrow as much as possible , but not so great for people who want to borrow smaller sums . <p> With an FHA-insured reverse mortgage , you must pay a 2 percent loan origination fee plus a 2 percent fee for mortgage insurance . <p> These fees are based not on the amount you borrow , but on the lesser of the appraised value of the house , up to a certain limit that varies by metropolitan area . It is $362,790 for the Bay Area and other high-priced areas . <p> If the bill passes , that limit would also go to $417,000 in all states but Alaska and Hawaii . <p> Today , anyone in the Bay Area who takes out an FHA-insured reverse mortgage  --  regardless of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $14,511 , in fees . <p> If the bill passes , the fees would increase by $2,169 to $16,680 . <p> These fees are in addition to title insurance , recording fees and other closing costs that can add a few thousand dollars to the cost of a loan . <p> Most borrowers fold these fees and closing costs into their loan amount , so there 's no cash out of pocket . <p> These steep fees can make reverse mortgages a very expensive option , especially if you move out of your home after just a few years . Pro-rated over many years , the fees are less burdensome . <p> " You need to think long and hard about how long you 're going to stay in your home , " says Susan Black , director of financial planning at eMoneyAdvisor . <p> In addition to those costs , borrowers must pay a fee for mortgage insurance that increases their annual interest rate by half a percentage point . <p> All FHA-insured reverse mortgages have variable interest rates pegged to the one-year Treasury bill . The interest rate is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , depending on how often it adjusts and interest rate caps . <p> In the last year , some lenders have introduced what are called alternative reverse mortgages that are not insured . Some permit very large or unlimited loan balances . Their fees may be higher or lower than FHA reverse mortgages . At least one lender , BNY Mortgage , offers a fixed-rate reverse mortgage . <p> Because these mortgages are so complex and home equity is such an important asset for seniors , the government requires borrowers to obtain HUD-approved counseling before taking one out . Last year , California required HUD-approved counseling for alternative reverse mortgages as well . <p> " I have seen people 's lives saved by reverse mortgages . I have seen people 's lives ended by reverse mortgages . That 's why counseling is so important , " says Shirley Hochhausen , a lawyer who specializes in predatory lending cases . <p> Counselors must talk to seniors about other options , such as selling their home and downsizing or renting , moving in with relatives , taking out a regular mortgage or home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brett Gookin , a wealth manager at Kochis Fitz , recently compared alternatives for a 90-year-old client who wanted cash from her $3 million San Francisco house . <p> " We looked at selling the home and renting , or taking out a mortgage , an equity line of credit or a reverse mortgage , " he says . <p> " Selling the home outright would give her the most after-tax resources , " he says . But like many seniors , she was emotionally attached to the house . <p> Before deducting fees , she could get 50 to 60 percent of the equity in her home with an alternative ( non-insured ) reverse mortgage , 75 percent with an equity line of credit and 80 percent with a conventional mortgage . <p> The starting interest rate would have been 9 percent with the reverse mortgage , 7.25 percent with the home equity line of credit and 6.5 percent fixed for 10 years with an interest-only mortgage . <p> He found a surprising disparity in reverse-mortgage fees . Two lenders wanted about $40,000 up front . A third wanted only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the end , they chose the home equity line of credit . The fees were between $3,000 and $6,000 , and she can pull out as much as she needs to live on and cover her mortgage payment . <p> She needed two of her children to co-sign the loan , something not all seniors can do . <p> In her case , taxes and her children 's inheritance were secondary issues , Gookin says . But they always should be considered . <p> A reverse mortgage " is a good idea for some people and not for others , " AARP 's Belling says . <p> " There is so much change , so many new products in the pipeline , if someone does n't have an urgent pressing need , it might be worthwhile to wait . We expect in two years there will be better products , more options , lower fees . " <p> On the other hand , a rise in interest rates could offset the advantage of waiting . <p> HR1852 also would eliminate the volume cap on FHA-insured reverse mortgages , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy them , says Meg Burns , FHA 's director of single family program development . It also would allow reverse mortgages on co-ops and would let someone essentially buy a house with a reverse mortgage . <p> It has passed a House committee and is waiting a vote by the full House , she says . " We expect it will be introduced on the Senate side shortly , " Burns adds . <p> Online resources Department of Housing and Urban Development <p> links.sfgate.com/ZLP <p> AARP <p> www.aarp.org <p> National Reverse Mortgage Loan Association <p> links.sfgate.com/ZLQ <p> CHART : <p> Reverse mortgages FHA-insured reverse mortgages made each fiscal year , which runs from Oct. 1 through Sept. 30 .
