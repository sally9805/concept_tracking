BITTER TRUTHS // Jim Crow was not merely about the physical separation of blacks and whites . Nor was segregation strictly about laws , despite historians tendency to fix upon such legal landmarks as Plessy v. Ferguson ( 1896 ) , Brown v. Board of Education ( 1954 ) , and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . In order to maintain dominance , whites needed more than the statutes and signs that specified " whites " and " blacks " only ; they had to assert and reiterate black inferiority with every word and gesture , in every aspect of both public and private life . Noted theologian Howard Thurman dissected the " anatomy " of segregation with chilling precision in his classic 1965 book , The Luminous Darkness . A white supremacist society must not only " array all the forces of legislation and law enforcement , " he wrote ; " it must falsify the facts of history , tamper with the insights of religion and religious doctrine , editorialize and slant news and the printed word . On top of that it must keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate public accommodations  --  all this in order to freeze the place of the Negro in society and guarantee his basic immobility . " Yet this was " but a partial indication of the high estimate " that the white South placed upon African Americans . " Once again , to state it categorically , " Thurman concludes , " the measure of a man 's estimate of your strength is the kind of weapons he feels that he must use in order to hold you fast in a prescribed place . " // As the interviews in this chapter  --  and indeed most of the interviews in this volume  --  suggest , the arsenal of weapons white southerners felt it necessary to use against black southerners was truly prodigious . In firsthand recollections stretching back to the early twentieth century , Behind the Veil informants tell stories of rapes and beatings , of houses burned to the ground and land stolen , of harrowing escapes in the middle of the night to evade lynch mobs or to avoid the slower , grinding death of perpetual poverty and indebtedness on southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about needing a pass to travel in Baker County , Georgia , is revealing . Passes had been common in the slave South and were used extensively in South Africa during apartheid , but the idea that an American citizen might need one to travel in his own home state in the post  --  World War II era seems outrageous , and in fact passes were not typical after slavery ended . Yet , Searles had been given one . He had seen the mutilated body of a Baker County lynching victim , and he knew how desperately white southerners wanted not only to keep blacks in a fixed position socially , but also to control their movements . Above all , he , like others of his generation , knew at some level that white control over black bodies and therefore black labor was key to southern agriculture and to the region 's slowly industrializing economy . Thus , whites rarely hesitated to use force against African Americans who threatened to destabilize labor arrangements or who tried to " steal away , " escaping from debt and abuse on tenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from bondage a generation or two earlier . The legacy of whites ' drive for social stability and control includes both the broken bodies of lynching victims and the grim wariness of men and women like Arthur Searles. // While a number of the stories in this chapter are about lynching and other forms of racial violence , informants also tell of moments that were less dramatic but nonetheless humiliating . " You could shop , " Theresa Lyons of Durham , North Carolina , suggests , " but if you walked up and a white person walked up later , they waited on the white person first . I mean , it was just a known that you were n't going to get waited on . Even when I knew that something was it , no matter how bad I wanted it , I would n't buy it . I would leave . " // For African Americans such as Lyons and Searles , life in the Jim Crow South was a process of navigating treacherous waters . Just as any stretch of ocean might offer smooth sailing on any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even helpful at times . However , they might also be unaccountably hostile and prejudiced . Thus , blacks had to remain ever vigilant in case storms of white fury should suddenly begin to blow . // Because they had to fight racist people as well as institutions the struggle of blacks against racial oppression was never so impersonal as a seaman 's struggle against the elements . Instead , living Jim Crow meant confronting bitter truths about human nature , including the arbitrary unpredictability of alleged white " friends " suddenly becoming mortal enemies . Among the most poignant of these realities emerged when African American children came to understand that blacks and whites were different in the eyes of their society . Often , the circumstances that led up to this realization were mundane , but the realization itself could be devastating . Walking to school , going to the store , playing on rural farms and city sidewalks , black children confronted racial differences in the taunts of white children , in the degrading treatment of black adults , and in their own observations of who was better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just automatically grow up inferior , " as Charles Gratton of Birmingham , Alabama , laments , " and you had the feeling that white people were better than you . " Yet , parents and other black adults worked hard to counteract such lessons . Employing a variety of child-rearing strategies , they encouraged black youths to maintain their self-respect regardless of white attitudes . // Children 's experiences also varied . Those who lived in or near cities often remember the physical signs of segregation  --  placards above water fountains , separate platforms at the train station , the often-shifting terrain of racial separation on the street car or bus . In the rural South , children 's memories of learning about racial difference are sometimes more subtle ( rural children played together ) and sometimes brutally stark ( in the countryside , white violence tended to be even less restrained ) . The stories of boys and girls also differ . Ferdie Walker 's memories of white policemen exposing themselves to her at a Fort Worth bus stop are but one case in point . // Even after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required them to perform , adult blacks regularly encountered new limitations on their freedom . Every visit to the doctor , every effort to get a job or buy land , much less register to vote , could result in a further restriction , an additional humiliation arbitrarily imposed . African Americans ' efforts to meet even basic needs such as health care could take them into minefields of white recalcitrance , as the testimonies of Milton Quigless and G. K. Butterfield suggest . Henry Hooten found that white southerners ' prejudices went with them even across the Atlantic during World War II . And , in 1958 , Walter Cavers uncovered the bitter truth that a seemingly straightforward car accident , for which he was not at fault , could result in terrible consequences . // For many Behind the Veil informants , a deep personal knowledge of American race relations at their worst has resulted in a sense of obligation to pass on an understanding of Jim Crow 's bitter truths to subsequent generations . // Chapter One ends with long narratives by Willie Harrell and Ann Pointer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South in the pre  --  World War II era and both of whom clearly feel they have important stories to tell . As these final two excerpts suggest , the history that Behind the Veil informants self-consciously narrate is a history with a purpose . " I 'm telling you , " Ann Pointer insists to the young man conducting her 1994 interview , " it sound funny to you because you never have been subject to nothing like this , but that 's what I want to tell you : how horrible it is when everything you do , the white man 's got to approve it . " // RALPH THOMPSON // Young children in every era interrogate the world around them as they come of age . During the years of segregation , African American children , encountering the puzzling realities of Jim Crow , looked to their parents and elders for answers to questions such as : " Why ca n't I drink out of the water fountain ? " " Why ca n't we try on clothes at this store ? " Or : " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white folks come walking down the street ? " // Explaining the laws of segregation and the practices of racial " etiquette " was a constant and extraordinarily difficult task for African American parents . How could they teach children the rules they had to follow in order to survive without damaging their self-esteem ? Ralph Thompson , who grew up on a tenant farm in the Memphis area in the late 1930s and early 1940s , describes his parents ' efforts to explain segregation and racism to him and his siblings . // They talked to us a little bit about that , but as things happened . They might respond to things . I can remember the insurance man coming over there one day and called my mother " Auntie . " And she looked at him and said , " Do n't you call me Auntie . ' I 'm not your Auntie . ' " I can remember that . His name was Mr. Watson , and this was back in the forties . You could just see little things like that and how they responded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep you away from things that would be embarrassing when they could n't fight back . For instance , going in a grocery store or something like that . If we went downtown and they had the colored drinking fountain and white drinking fountain  --  in looking back , my sister and I talk about it now  --  my mother would always tell us to drink water before we left home . So we did n't get caught into drinking water out . Little things like that . Things like going in a store and you ca n't try the clothes on . When I got up to about 12 , 14 , 15 years old , and I 'd go to Thom McAn to buy shoes , if I had a $20 bill , they would check that $20 bill like it was counterfeit . I could n't walk in a Thom McAn shoe store and buy a pair of shoes because they did n't want to take my money . They would treat me like this is counterfeit , and they 'd look at it . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that . You go to a store , and you 're standing there and a white person walks up , and they 'll wait on that white person and just make you stand . So my parents kind of kept us away from that and they would n't let us do certain things . // When you look back at it , you can tell why  --  because they could n't defend us . So they tried to shield us from it by sending us or taking us in a different direction , and whatever was going on , they tried to keep it away from us , so to speak . My daddy , if it was a white person around talking to him in some kind of business format , he would move away from us or tell us to go play or something . I guess that was to protect us from something that might be said to him that he was n't able to defend . If they were talking about planting or settling up or something like that . He very seldom would do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere else . // But just being called a " nigger , " I ca n't remember no adult person calling him one . I remember kids did it , but I do n't remember any adults doing us like that . I can remember at the drugstore , some evenings we would stop in there and get ice cream , and the pharmacist was real nice to us . He could scoop the ice cream up . He 'd scoop it up and he could throw it up in the air and catch it with the cone , and that was kind of entertaining . We 'd come through there in the afternoon . If we bought ice cream , he 'd do that for us . In this particular drugstore he did n't put any stools at his counter . When you look back I guess he said I 'll treat you as fair as I can and if I do n't put the stools here , I do n't have to worry about nobody sitting down . You get your ice cream . You have to move on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed like . I can remember that guy . // LILLIAN SMITH // A few years older than Ralph Thompson , Lillian Smith grew up in a predominately black neighborhood in Wilmington , North Carolina , in the 1930s . She , too , describes how her elders approached the task of instructing children in the laws and practices of Jim Crow . // The main thing , the theme throughout , was that we 're living in a segregated society . I did n't understand segregation until I was maybe nine or ten years old , when I was reading and I could see the signs saying " colored " and " white . " You could n't drink at a water fountain even though you were shopping in the same store that people of any other nationality were shopping in . We would ask questions about that and my parents and grandparents said : " You would get arrested . " So , when that word was used , any time you saw " white " and " colored , " unless you wanted to be arrested and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was the dividing line , and that lesson was really laid down solidly when we were , I would say , between seven and nine . // Naturally , you would ask , " Why ? " The question would always come back that we were living in a country that had segregated laws , and we were called " colored " people at that time . See , the signs said " colored . " You were not looked upon as having full rights that all other citizens should have . We should be treated differently . That was what the sign was . And then , of course , they started talking about slavery . So from about age seven on , they started giving us information about slavery  --  before I even read about it in a book . Because in our culture , which was our racial group , what most of us knew about slavery was handed down from word of mouth , from family members or friends or neighbors or whatever , and maybe a lot of it never was written . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you know what to avoid and how to respond and behave . Because , see , the working word there was " behavior . " You have to watch your behavior. // CHARLES GRATTON // Charles Gratton was born in 1932 and grew up in the Norwood neighborhood of Birmingham , Alabama . Asked when he first became aware of segregation , he describes how he was " programmed " in the bitter truths of Jim Crow . // Actually , when I got old enough to know myself , to really know I existed . I mean , I was born into this thing and raised in it . I can remember very close in my mind times when my mother would send me to this grocery store that was approximately a mile away , which was the only grocery store in Norwood . She would give me instructions before I 'd leave home and tell me , " Son , now you go on up to this store and get this or that for me . If you pass any white people on your way , you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move over . Do n't challenge white people . " So I was just brought up in that environment . // They also had a park . It was about a block from where I was born and raised and where I lived , and it was known as the white people 's park . They had a tennis court there and nice park trees , and blacks was n't allowed in that park . I mean we just could n't go there . You know , it 's just one of those things . // Some days I would be sick , and I could hear the schoolchildren playing during their lunch hour down at Norwood Elementary School , which was all white , and that 's what really stuck in my mind . I 'd say , " It 's a shame that I have to walk so far to school every day . " When I 'd hear those schoolchildren playing , I 'd say , " Here I am a block and a half from the elementary school , and I 've got to walk six or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , I can almost hear those kids , those white kids down at this elementary school playing , and the noise and laughing and playing , and I 'm at home sick basically from the exposure of walking those six and seven miles to school every day . Whether it was raining or not , I had to go . So those are some of the memories that I have of my childhood growing up over at Norwood . // I do n't know if I ever just specifically came out and asked that question of why things were the way they were , but it was one of those things where you had been programmed all along , ever since you got old enough to know right from wrong . To challenge white people just was the wrong thing to do . You just automatically grow up inferior , and you had the feeling that white people were better than you . It just really was n't any question asked then about why . I mean , that was white people things . That was a white people school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any right to go there . It basically never entered my mind . // Most blacks in the South felt that way , until the late fifties and sixties , when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. come along with his philosophy , and it started giving black people some hope that the way we were being treated was n't right and this thing can change . Just some hope that we were waiting on . Whenever I would hear Dr. King talk , it seemed like he was touching me from the inside . He could touch your feeling from the inside , things that you would want to say but you just did n't know how , things that were right and wrong but you kept it inside of you because you did n't know how to express it . So he was really a great leader and a great man , and I think he done a wonderful job in what he done for our people as a whole . // FERDIE WALKER // Ferdie Walker was born in 1928 and grew up in Fort Worth , Texas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awareness of Jim Crow , when children encountered racist stereotypes about black men and women 's sexuality . From the days of slavery on , whites justified the sexual exploitation of black women by describing them as lustful " Jezebels " who supposedly wanted the sexual attentions white men forced upon them . Meanwhile , black men 's efforts to advance politically and economically after the Civil War encouraged white southerners to create a new black male character-type to go along with the " Uncle Tom " and " Sambo " of the old plantation : that of the black beast rapist . The rape or attempted rape of a white woman became the standard explanation for why thousands of black men were lynched in the South in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , despite the fact that rape was not even a charge in the vast majority of cases . // Just as lynching persisted into the post  --  World War II era , degrading sexual stereotypes continued to affect individual black men and women 's lives in myriad ways . In Ferdie Walker 's case , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexually harassing an 11-year-old child simply because she was black . As Walker explains , her terrifying childhood experiences resulted in a lifelong distrust of the police , shaping her own child-rearing practices and her work as a public health nurse in the 1950s. // I tell you this one thing that really sticks in my mind , one really harassing kind of thing that I went through at that time . I was 11 years old , and I will never forget it . I used to go back and forth to church on Sunday afternoons to the United Methodist youth group , and I always rode the bus . You had to stand on the corner , which was about two blocks from my house , to catch the bus . In those days , all police people were white , and all bus drivers were white , and these policemen would harass me as I was standing on this corner waiting for the bus to come . Sometimes the two of them would drive up . The bus stop was up high and the street was down low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd expose themselves while I was standing there , and it just really scared me to death . And the only reason I did not go home at that time was because if I had gone home , my mother would have made me stay . So I just stepped back from the corner , and because I rode that way all the time , the bus driver did n't have to see me standing there at the corner . He 'd always stop and I 'd get on the bus . // But it was these same cops . So I had a morbid fear of policemen all of my life and it has not completely gone away . This was in the broad open daylight with the sun shining . But I will never forget it , and it always comes back to me every time I get into a really tight experience . That was really bad and it was bad for all black girls , you know . // It was really hard for me to tell my children that policemen were helping people . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I said , " Well , this is something that you got to do . " I had a job as public health nurse at Topeka , Kansas , and we had a lot of child abuse even then and that was in the fifties . My supervisor gave me a situation . She said , " Now when you go to a house and a man is beating his wife , what are you going to do ? " I said , " Call the minister . " And she said , " Ferdie , you 're an intelligent person . You know that 's not right . " I told her . She 's a wonderful person . I said , " Alice Jensen , I know that 's not the right answer . I should call the police , but I do n't believe in the police . " And that was after my third child was born . So it has taken a long time for me to have any kind of trust in policemen as a group even when I tried to say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like everybody else . " But it 's really very difficult for me . That has stayed with me. // STINE GEORGE // When blacks in the Jim Crow South aspired to economic and social equality with whites , their white neighbors often met them with disapproval or even violence . Such was the case when Seine George 's father William bought a piece of coveted real estate at the urging of his white boss , Jesse Morgan , who also helped him negotiate a loan from the Federal Homing Authority ( FHA ) . Morgan believed that William George had earned the right to the land since he had always been a " good nigger . " Morgan 's sons disagreed , and the George family soon saw their house burned to the ground . Seine George 's younger brother and sister died in the flames . // Mr. Morgan said to my father , " You 've been a good nigger , so I 'll tell you what I 'm going to do . I 'm going to sell you this farm . " Dad said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't buy no farm . " He said , " The government will buy it for you . In fact , we already started buying it . You just go over there and talk with Brown "  --  that was the FHA man  --  " and he 'll let you sign the papers . I 've already got them made up . We 're the government . " Laughter . That was it . Talk to my daddy , he 'll tell you the same . " We 're the government , " Morgan said . " Just go over there and sign the papers . " // That 's what happened . Morgan did n't tell his sons about what he had done . He did n't want to tell them until after my dad signed the papers . That farm was on the main road at that time , see , and nothing but white folks there , and good land on a hill , too . See , black folks would always get in the bottom , but this was on a hill , nice hill land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway , them sons had a fit . It was two of them . Boy , they had a fit , and they went over there and they were going to stop it because they said their daddy was senile , he did n't know what he was doing . The people at the FHA office said , " Well , he 's done signed the papers . We ca n't withdraw it now . " // So then they came out to the house mad . See , one of Morgan 's sons had a fence put all the way around the farm . In fact , my dad did all the work , but he bought the fence and the posts and everything . It was new wire . It had just been up about a year . So they came out there and told my dad , " That 's our wire . " Said , " You 've got to take all that wire down and roll it up and give it back to us . " Around that whole farm , see , take up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continues ... ) //
