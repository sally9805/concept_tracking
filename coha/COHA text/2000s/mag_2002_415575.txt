<p> Our boys have guns , bullets , tanks , planes - just about everything you 'd need to do battle . There 's even an enemy . So why is n't there an actual war ? A dispatch from Afghanistan <p> OPERATION CHEROKEE Sky begins after dark on June 29th when a Canadian reconnaissance or " reccy " platoon departs Kandahar Air Field in southern Afghanistan . About a dozen troops aboard Toyota 4x4s set out on the seventy-five-mile journey to the town of Qalat , in the east , believed to be a secret Taliban stronghold . The reccy platoon 's job is to drive into the mountains north of the town and scout landing zones for a helicopter assault on two caves , dubbed " Big-Ass Cave " and " Smaller-Ass Cave " by operation planners . <p> Next morning at about eight Zulu ( military time ) , a fifty-vehicle armored column assembles outside the gates of the airfield . Its job is to drive to Qalat and then encircle a medieval fortress that intelligence analysts believe is being used as a Taliban staging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty miles south and sweep through a village where Taliban forces reportedly held a conference a week earlier , which ended with them rampaging through the countryside , burning a school and shooting villagers , killing at least one . About 500 Canadians are slated for this mission . One hundred Americans are also involved , serving as helicopter crews , in Air Force Special Operations ground teams and in Special Forces , whose behind-the-scenes role is to control the entire operation . <p> Before the Canadians depart in their armored column on the morning of June 30th , they crowd onto a dusty spit of land for an address from their commander , Lt. Col. Patrick Stogran . He stands on a pile of dirt atop a bunker and tells his troops not to fear the enemy . " If they fuck with us , the wrath of hell on earth will be upon them , " he says . " The fury of hell is 500 men in green baggy suits , " referring to the forest-green combat uniforms worn by the Canadians . These seem out of place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only because of a massive screw-up back in Ottawa . They are extremely uncomfortable and as such have become both a joke and a symbol of the toughness of the soldiers who wear them . Playing on this theme , Stogran continues , " If they go to hell , I want visions of green demons to be the last thing they see . " <p> Stogran is a lean , handsomely weathered forty-three-year-old who in his dress uniform and dark-green beret bears a passing resemblance to famed British World War II Gen. Bernard Law Montgomery . Stogran is something of a character at Kandahar Air Field , where the main Canadian force in Afghanistan is posted . In briefing sessions , he jokingly refers to the Taliban enemy as " heathens . " At the same time , he carries Muslim prayer beads given to him " by a mujahedin friend . " When the Canadians held a tough-man fighting contest in early June , Stogran entered and took on his deputy commanding officer , a beefy man at least fifty pounds heavier . Spectators claim the vastly outmuscled Stogran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring during a timeout ( still , the colonel lost ) . Stogran 's flair for the dramatic is tempered by his directness and sincerity . In April , after four of his soldiers were killed and eight seriously wounded in an accidental bombing by the U.S. Air Force , he sat in the scarred rose garden outside his office and cried . <p> Despite his grief over that loss , Stogran does not hide the excitement he feels at commanding an army during war . When I run into him a few nights before the launch of Cherokee Sky , he expresses regret that this will be the Canadians ' final mission before going home at the end of July . " When I came home after Bosnia , " he says , referring to the peacekeeping mission the Canadians have maintained in the bloody former Yugoslav republic since the mid-1990s , " civilized life seemed almost boring . " He smiles . " There 's something to be said about living in a place of total lawlessness and anarchy . You never know what 's going to happen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kandahar in January , was involved in two major operations before Cherokee Sky . But its ambition to prove itself in combat has been thwarted by faulty intelligence assessments of where the enemy is actually located . " I thought Tora Bora was going to be something magical , " Stogran says , referring to the massive hunt for al Qaeda in the caves of southern Afghanistan in January . " But in the end it was far less than we had expected . It was the same in Anaconda . We expected to find hundreds of enemy fighters . We probably encountered twenty-five . " <p> Few American officers will speak as candidly about unmet objectives in Afghanistan . The last major operation prior to Cherokee Sky , the American-led Apache Snow II , entailed a massive helicopter assault on two villages north of the Pakistani border in early June . It took ten days of planning , 200 American soldiers and more than a dozen helicopters and fighters to capture a few hundred dollars ' worth of corroded ammunition and weapons . <p> THE MAIN ARMORED COLumn departs Kandahar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimistically referred to as " Highway One " on Coalition maps , is littered with blown-up fuel trucks , bomb craters and collapsed bridges . About twenty miles east of Kandahar , it starts to degenerate into a single narrow , rutted lane . The column includes seventeen eight-wheeled Canadian armored vehicles - Bisons or Coyotes - and about a dozen American Humvees outfitted with anti-tank missiles and automatic grenade launchers . The remaining twenty-five or so vehicles are fuel and transport tracks . Overhead , Apache Attack helicopters fly air support . <p> In pre-mission briefings , the governor of Qalat , Hamidullah Tokhi Khan , was portrayed as an active Taliban supporter masquerading as a U.S. ally . During a slide presentation in the briefing room , Khan 's name was projected on the wall beneath a warning in bold red letters , THIS GUY IS NOT TO BE TRUSTED . Cherokee Sky 's mission was to surround Khan 's fort , outside of Qalat , where 300 of his soldiers maintained a garrison . Stogran would then stride up to the fort 's gate and demand entry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Stogran said at the briefing . " We can expect resistance . " Following an expected confrontation and possible exchange of gunfire with the fort 's gatekeepers , Coalition troops would enter and conduct a room-to-room search , detaining and frisking each of the fort 's occupants and arresting those believed to be Taliban . <p> But in the last hours before the mission starts , everything changes . During the final briefing , an American Special Forces soldier with the code name Coyote interrupts Stogran to announce a new plan . Coyote says that his men have delivered a letter to a close ally of Khan 's , warning the warlord that Coalition forces will be coming to his province . Furthermore , Coyote explains that an SF team will be entering the fortress and meeting with Khan hours in advance of the Canadian armored column . <p> Stogran shows no reaction to the news that his surprise siege has been scuttled . Without missing a beat , he says , " Then I intend to walk in solo to the fort and do some handshaking and backslapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provoke a confrontation , he adds , " What we will do next will be determined by my pucker factor " - " pucker factor " being military slang for " ass-puckering fear , " the instinct a soldier has to either stay , fight or flee . Coyote interrupts again , telling the colonel that he wo n't actually be walking into the fort . " Our guys are now planning to have Governor Khan send some guys to meet you outside the fort . " <p> But even this plan falls apart within hours of the mission 's departure . Soon after the convoy leaves , a fuel trailer bursts into flames because of the desert heat . Another breaks an axle . Due to the dust and mountainous terrain , radios in the vehicles cease operating beyond a three-mile range . The road is jammed with traffic - trucks carrying fuel and tires from Pakistan and cars filled with returning refugees , their roofs stacked five feet high with bags and bird cages . ( Afghans , even in the worst poverty , have a mania for keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take four hours . Nearly nine hours after we began , we reach the fortress at Qalat . <p> By the time we arrive , we learn from radio chatter that " Sunray " - Stogran 's call sign - has been greeted warmly at the fort by Khan . Stogran 's troops , frustrated that their showdown with the Taliban has turned into a meet-and-greet , speculate sardonically on their commander 's fate . " Sunray is staying inside the fort , " says a voice over the radio . Somewhere in the darkness , another Canadian voice calls out , " You think they 're raping Sunray yet on the hood of one of their trucks , eh ? " <p> The governor , suddenly a friend of the Coalition , has invited us to camp that night outside his mansion in a desert plain above town . We drive several more miles before reaching a barren field in front of Gov . Khan 's walled compound , which is about half the size of a Wal-Mart . We circle the armored vehicles , post watches and sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a helicopter air assault on mountain caves forty-five minutes to the north . <p> Just before sunrise , the seventeen Bisons and Coyotes form a ring around a mountain dubbed " Objective North . " The idea is to cut off any Taliban fleeing Big-Ass and Smaller-Ass caves , which are at this moment being invaded by 200 Canadian troops dropped in by choppers . The first Apache escorts appear overhead just as a shepherd leads a flock of sheep across the desert to a well . <p> But the caves turn out to contain nothing more than bat droppings . Over the radio , someone asks permission to blow up Big-Ass Cave " to deny the enemy a hiding place , " though you get the idea it would also be a fun thing to do for bored soldiers with plenty of C-4 explosive . The request is denied due to the fear that destroying Big-Ass might bring down an entire side of the mountain and wipe out other caves thought to contain primitive wall drawings . " It 's not good if we blow up cultural stuff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disappointment in his voice . <p> After this operation sputters out , we pick up a U.S. Air Fonre two-man Special Operations team , who go by the names Dragon-1 and Dragon-6 . They pile into the Bison , greeting the Canadians with warm handshakes . Special Operations soldiers annoy just about everyone in the regular Army because they tend to have the most up-to-date weapons and gizmos and get to accessorize their fatigues with cool add-ons such as exotic hiking gear and colorful local garb . Dragons 1 and 6 wear the latest Patagonia " wicking fabric " shirts and Arab head scarves and smell of coconut suntan lotion . Both are covered in grime from their adventure on the mountain - they had explored all the caves on their own , hours before the air assault - but both are handsome enough to be Abercrombie &; Fitch models , dirtied up by make-up artists for an ad campaign . <p> The Canadians receive the young Americans with icy politeness . Gradually , though , the twin Dragons , who are so damned friendly , win the Canadians over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old , " passes the time chattering about his favorite motorcycles back home and their relative merits in picking up girls at the mall - " Pull up in a Buell and chicks just slide onto your seat . " Then he switches subjects to at vacation he took last summer in Germany . " I thought about hitchhiking , " he says . " But my mom worried that it was too dangerous , so I rented a car . " <p> INSIDE KHAN 'S FORT , ABOUT fifty Canadian and American soldiers have set up a camp , where they have been sleeping for the two nights since the operation began . At the outset of Cherokee Sky , the plan had been to surround , search and possibly arrest the 300 or so troops in this fort . Now , Coalition soldiers mingle guardedly with Khan 's men , barefoot solders armed with AKs . Many paint their lids with black kohl eyeliner , a fashion once popular among the Taliban . <p> U.S. Sgt. Maj. Iuniasolua Savusa stands near a camo net strung up by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asks . The fort is known to have existed since at least medieval times . Some speculate the place had been a fort since Alexander the Great moved his army through here more than 2,000 years ago . <p> But it is n't so much history that permeates the place as it is the smell of human feces . Khan 's 300 men utilize every spare inch of dirt as an open-air toilet . In some places , dried excrement is piled six inches deep . <p> " My first night here , " says a Canadian sergeant , " I woke up with a fucking turd next to my head . " <p> " I do n't blame Alexander the Great or Genghis Khan , whoever the hell it was , for getting the fuck out of here , " says Savusa , spitting tobacco juice into the dust . " I hope we do the same . " <p> Unlike the rest of the men , Lt. Col. Stogran is in high spirits . He stands in an impromptu command tent set up with wall-size maps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are going to air-assault the mountains around the village of Shinkay , " he tells the assembled commanders . " We are sending our armored squadron down tonight to block exits from Shinkay . Governor Khan has agreed to provide soldiers to sweep the village . " <p> After marathon meetings with Khan during the previous thirty-six hours , the warlord has now denounced the Taliban and declared his undying loyalty to the Coalition cause . In a few hours , Khan says , 200 of his own troops will go door-to-door in Shinkay , rounding up traitors . <p> Col. Mike Linnington , the American commander in Kandahar , cinched the deal when he flew in and presented Khan with a gift bowie knife inscribed with the logo of the 101st Airborne Division . Through a translator , Col. Linnington explained that Jim Bowie had been an American hero who died at the Alamo in Texas , the home state of President Bush . According to witnesses , the story had been garbled in translation and Khan believed the knife was a gift from Bush himself . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days later , Linnington tells a reporter , " Boy , I was good . I bullshitted that bastard left and right . " <p> The final pre-raid meeting with Gov . Khan takes place later that evening . Stogran , accompanied by a translator , the U.S. Special Forces soldier Coyote and a handful of other SF , meet the warlord in a carpet-lined room in his mansion . Khan , a potbellied man in his late thirties , greets the Coalition emissaries warmly . The room smells of fresh paint . <p> Coyote does most of the talking for the Coalition side . " How many soldiers are you giving us for this mission ? " he asks . <p> " I will prepare fifty mujahedin for the assault , " Khan says through the translator . " Thirty of these come from my personal guard . " It 's far fewer than the 200 men promised by the governor earlier in the day , but he vows , " The enemy can not escape from us . I will give you my best commander ; he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the district so well . " <p> Coyote thanks him profusely . <p> " If one American is shot , " Khan swears , " five of my men will be shot . " <p> He promises Stogran that his soldiers will turn up three prominent Taliban leaders in Shinkay . Stogran seems happy to believe this prediction . <p> " Shinkay offers the possibility of excitement , " he says . <p> OUR ARMORED COLUMN rumbles into action four hours before sunrise . In central Qalat , we stop to pick up a passenger , an SF soldier who goes by the nickname Halo . SF function in twelve-man teams called Operational Detachment Alphas . They display a swaggering , almost reckless sense of humor and function as a law unto themselves . Some ODA teams are rumored to have adopted all of the customs common among Afghan soldiers , including the constant smoking of hash . One ODA team I encounter pulls me aside , laughing hysterically at what they call my " Rolling Stoned " press card . " Rolling Stoned will love this ! " a soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera . " It 's the best cache we 've found so far in Afghanistan . " Given his weirdly excited laughter , I half-expect to see photos of ear necklaces or some similar forbidden war trophies . Instead of trophy ears , however , he scrolls through the images until he finds several showing teammates holding wet , sticky buds of marijuana . <p> " Howdy ! " Halo shouts to the half-dozen guys in the back of the vehicle once he 's aboard . Without waiting for a response , he launches into a monologue about the woes of Afghanistan . " Did you know there 's water everywhere here ? It runs in underground rivers just beneath the surface of the desert . Problem is Afghans do n't even know how to drill a well . They dig wells by hammering pipes directly into the ground . They do n't understand the concept of drilling . But that 's what happens when your whole country 's illiterate , and if they can read , the only book they know is the Koran . They 'd rather just run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Afghan native dress - " shooting each other . " <p> Halo , who is thirty-six years old , resembles the comedian Chris Elliott on steroids , and like a comic character , his taunting cheerfulness seems a thin disguise for his anti-social tendencies . Still , he seems to be having a good time in Afghanistan . <p> " You should see these guys try to shoot their guns , " he says , laughing . " They do n't even aim . A lot of them saw the stocks off their AKs because they think it looks neat . Without the stock , an AK shoots gas out the back . The only way to fire it is to hold it out and spray . They 're lucky if they hit you at twenty meters . We hit ' em with ambushes at 300 meters with a sniper rifle with a silencer . All you see is one guy slump over . His buddy stands up to see what 's going on , we take him out . We 've taken out five guys before the rest realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convoy grinds to a halt . We 're now in a mountain pass - part of an old smuggler 's route to Pakistan - and it 's impossible to see why the lead vehicle has stopped . " It 's a fork in the road , " Halo says confidently . " Afghans - at least here in the south - will always stop at a fork in the road . Even if they 've been down it a hundred times before , they 'll have to debate about it . " <p> As if on cue , a voice comes over the radio saying that we 're stopped because Khan 's soldiers ca n't decide which fork to take in the trail . Halo slumps against the side of the vehicle . <p> The convoy resumes its march haltingly , stopping for a few more forks . The third time , several of the trucks turn oil their engines . One of Khan 's soldiers walks down the line of vehicles , stopping at each , gesturing wildly . <p> Halo points to him and says , " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother-in-law . " The commander draws near . " This man has a barely functional relationship with reality , " Halo says . " See that watch on his wrist ? That 's a joke . He does n't even know how to tell time . I 've asked him what time it is , he ca n't tell you - his watch is upside down . " <p> Khan 's commander is asking occupants of each vehicle if they have any spare AA batteries , which are prized commodities in these parts . For the next twenty minutes the Afghan troops refuse to budge until finally we hand over batteries . <p> The original plan called for the armored column to take up positions behind the village of Shinkay under cover of darkness . Then , Canadian troops would drop into the mountain passes , blocking the retreat of Taliban soldiers flushed out in the door-to-door sweep conducted by Khan 's soldiers . But Khan 's men could n't locate the route behind the village , and so we roll into the Shinkay valley long past sunrise . Given our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town . <p> We enter the first narrow opening in the outer wall of Shinkay just as the helicopters swoop in over the horizon . Children rush out onto rooftops . Women peek out of doors , crying . Some kids cover their eyes in fear . Our engines throw up a horrible racket as we squeeze into the narrow , high-walled streets . When we reach the western gate of the village , our Bison sets up a blocking action . We 're joined by two Toyotas full of Khan 's troops . <p> " This is going to be a dry well , " Halo says . " Khan 's troops are n't going to do anything . " <p> As he speaks , several of Khan 's soldiers descend from the trucks and crawl beneath them to nap in the shade . <p> " Khan really does n't want to help us , " Halo says . " See , two weeks ago our ODA first visited Khan . We told him if he did n't go along with us , we were going to kill him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us now , but he 's afraid to take on the Taliban here . " <p> Halo climbs down from the truck to consult with his SF comrade Coyote Several local elders appear bearing cups of hot chat tea to offer the foreign occupiers . Coyote , Halo , a translator and a portly village elder gather behind the Bison . Through the translator , the elder thanks the coalition soldiers for visiting his village . <p> " I 've heard it all before , " Halo says " He 's going to tell us the bad guys left town . They always say the same thing . " <p> The old man stops speaking and shoots Halo a look . The translator says , " There was a bad man here three weeks ago , but he left on his motorcycle to a different village east of here . " <p> Stogran scrubs the entire mission a couple hours later , and we withdraw from Shinkay without conducting a search . " I thought Khan 's men were going to search specific locations in town , " Stogran says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked at me , confused . He said , But the Taliban are over there . ' He pointed east . Perhaps the problem had something to do with the commander 's obvious inability to read a map . " <p> On the long ride back to Qalat , Halo says , " We are going to talk to Khan tonight . He 's got to give us something , or else we 'll have to renew our offer to kill him . " <p> Next morning , outside Khan 's mansion , the warlord 's commander leads a small caravan of Toyotas stacked with crates containing surface-to-air missiles - an arms cache they turn over to the Coalition as a show of good faith . In the wrong hands , the missiles could easily be used to shoot down Coalition jets or passenger liners . Twenty-six of the missiles are Russian SA-7s or Pakistani knockoffs . Three are British-made Blowpipe missiles , precursor to the American Stinger . These are marked as having been manufactured in 1984 - about the time the CIA 's program to arm Afghanistan in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A journalist from a wire service walks down to the area where the missile boxes were unloaded . " This arms cache was discovered as a result of the successful Coalition mission in this area , " Halo tells the reporter .
