<p> " At 17 , I thought I knew everything . " <p> Sixty years later , sitting in her kitchen and reminiscing about the war , Jeaninne Gillingham can hardly stop laughing as she recalls her girlish recklessness and the headstrong adventure that swept her from this sleepy town in Normandy to Oelwein , Iowa . <p> " He was a big tall man , very good looking , " she remembers . " I thought ' That 's the one I want to talk to . ' So I took out my English books . " <p> Jeaninne Massey 's chance meeting in a field near her home with Howard Gillingham , a welder repairing tanks with the US 2nd Division just after D-Day , changed her life . But she was hardly alone . <p> Almost as soon as they hit the beaches , GIs started hitting on the local girls . And around 6,000 of them took home French war brides . Some of their stories of cross-cultural love are chronicled in the new book , " Des Amours de GIs , " published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shedding new light on an aspect of World War II history that has been little explored . <p> Thumbing their noses at language barriers , cultural differences , and often at their parents , these Franco-American couples brought together in the heat of war or the glow of liberation let their passions rule . Today , writes Hilary Kaiser in the prologue to her book , " We are struck by their naivete , their romanticism , and the impetuosity of their decisions . " <p> Half the marriages that Ms. Kaiser recounts ended in divorce , weighed down with incompatibilities . A pert Parisian shopgirl found herself picking cotton on her husband 's farm in the middle of segregated Alabama , and could n't stand it . Another woman realized after a couple of years of life in America that she and her husband " had absolutely nothing in common . " <p> Despite the difficulties , however , and the often hasty nature of their origins , many of these marriages , facilitated by the War Brides Act of 1945 , which paid the women 's transatlantic voyages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , was married to her husband for nearly 50 years , until Howard died in 1994 , and says their relationship was strengthened by the unaccustomed things she found herself doing in Oelwein , such as building the family home . <p> " I made the cement , I made everything . Before , I had never even made my bed . You see what love can do ? " she says with a broad grin . <p> Jeaninne Gillingham coped with that sort of reality . So did Jacqueline Decker , who now lives just a few miles from Utah Beach , where her husband Ambrose landed in1944 . But reality was far from her mind when she met him in Paris a year later , Mrs. Decker acknowledges . <p> " When you are 17 and 23 , when the girl is cute and the boy is good-looking , that 's a pretty powerful attraction , " she says . " Plus , it was the end of the war , we were living a special time , everything bad was over , it was like a movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women who dared to leave everything they knew behind " were rather adventurous , and saw a chance for a better life , " says Kaiser . Marcelle Boswell Rougeaux , who found herself married to an Alabama farm boy , recalls in the book : " I was just 18 , I was fed up with the war and the shortages and looking after my three sisters and my brother all the time . America offered a new horizon . " <p> In the girls ' imaginations , America was the land of milk and honey , especially after the privations of war time . Little did they realize how hard a landing they risked , especially if their eyes had lighted on a poor boy : Many of them found themselves living with their in-laws , who were not always welcoming . They had to learn a new language and new customs while their husbands looked for work . Fitting in was rarely easy . <p> None of that went through Jeaninne Massey 's head in the weeks after D-Day , as she courted Howard Gillingham each evening after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cafe , and he had spent it near the front line repairing tanks . <p> " We would go to the Americans camped in their tents to bring them strawberries and milk and butter , and they would give us chocolate and other treats we had not seen for years , " she recalls . " My mother told my father , ' You notice your daughter always talks to the same big GI ? ' And he said , ' They do n't understand each other , so do n't worry . ' I do n't know how we communicated : I used a dictionary , we used our hands . " <p> On the evening of July 25 , " I arrived like usual " at the field where the Americans were camped " and there 's nobody there . Boy . But everybody knew about Howard and me , and someone bring me a cigarette pack with a message on the back : ' We 've moved to the church . ' For the first time and the last time for several years we kissed . Big thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Where to , Jeaninne did n't know , but that did not stop her from writing to Howard in care of his unit , even though she did not know whether he was getting her letters , and she heard nothing back . " I never let it go , " she says now . " What women want , women get , and we were very romantic . " <p> In one letter , in her carefully elaborate French schoolgirl 's handwriting , she wrote to him : " I write well the American but I do not know speak it , I wait for you in order to learn . Have trust in me . " ( She still has some of those letters , " Returned to Sender , Addressee Unknown " or copies she made of them at the time . ) <p> And then , six months later , she received a Christmas card from Howard , a sign that he was still interested . Jeaninne wrote back : " My mother want that you learn very much the French in order to speak with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your head . " <p> Not that Jeaninne 's mother and father were very keen on this liaison , based on a six-week pidgin English courtship . When Howard proposed , in one of his haphazardly spelled , pencil-scrawled letters , " My father said he would have to come back a civilian and a Catholic . He figured that would stop everything . " <p> Meanwhile the months of absence and the long silences caused by the vagaries of war-time mail played on Jeaninne 's nerves . " It is soon one month that I have not mail from you ... I ask myself what you have or if you are angry with me ? " she wrote in June 1945 , by which time Howard was in Germany . <p> He allayed her fears with a surprise one-day visit ( he had received permission to visit his wounded brother in a Paris hospital and made a detour to Normandy ) . " I did n't know if he had any hair , " Mrs. Gillingham laughs . " I had never seen him without his helmet . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he found work repairing agricultural machinery . Jeaninne went back to her letter writing . " Here it is cold and raining , I sure do n't like that , " she wrote in November 1945 . " It is the winter that begin and I fear that it may be necessary to spend it without to see you , my heart is melancholy . I have always known you in the fine days of summer . " <p> Eighteen months later , Howard had converted to Catholicism and saved up the money to come back to France and marry Jeaninne . The wedding " was a big to-do . Everybody came out to see that . " Then he brought her back home . <p> America was a shock , and not always a pleasant one . Howard 's first treat for his new bride - a hamburger and malted milk in New York - did not go down very well . " I did n't think too much of that . I was used to good fancy French restaurants . " <p> And the dress code in rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost , " Jeaninne remembers . " Where were all the beautiful hats , the pretty dresses ? Howard took me to buy a pair of jeans and when I had put them on he threw a bucket of water over me . I had no idea what was happening . " <p> Jeaninne and Howard spent 14 years in the US before returning with their children to Normandy to take over the Massey family cafe in Le Molay Littry . " It was hard . Americans do n't leave just like that . We had the house and furniture paid for . It was kind of rough " to pull up stakes , Mrs. Gillingham recalls . <p> Howard never learned to speak French properly before he died and it never really bothered him , nor any of his cafe 's customers . This week the cafe and the town 's main newsstand - both run by Jeaninne 's sons - are sporting red , white , and blue in the windows , and a lot of photos of Howard Gillingham . " I am proud to be French and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one of those photos . " I fight for both sides . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
