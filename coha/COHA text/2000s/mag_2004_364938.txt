A good line of dialogue can make a career . At just 19 , Keira Knightley owns one widely quoted multiplex moment . In last summer 's Pirates of the Caribbean : The Curse of the Black Pearl , Knightley dismissed a black-toothed marauder with a metal pole and the trailer-ready line , " You like pain ? Try wearing a corset . " Now , if all goes according to plan , she will add a second epigram to her name . In King Arthur , which hits theaters nationwide on July 7 , she plays Guinevere as a heavily muscled , lethal woman warrior . ( Arthur , like Pirates , is a Jerry Bruckheimer production . ) When one of the more sensitive knights of the Round Table confesses before battle to fearing the hairy , scary enemy , Knightley 's Guinevere scoffs , " Do n't worry , I wo n't let them rape you . " <P> With a bit of tweaking , both lines could have been delivered by Arnold Schwarzenegger , which may explain why Knightley has so quickly ingratiated herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it much of an achievement . Knightley , a native Londoner , has a refined look , brisk comic timing and a brawler 's instinct for knowing when to shut up and throw a punch , but that does n't mean she 's ready to tackle Chekhov . " I do n't think I can call myself an actress yet , " she says . " I just do n't think my skill level is that high . I hope that with every job it gets better . But until I 'm good , I can say I 'm trying to be an actor , but I do n't think I 've completely made it . " <P> Knightley is n't being modest . She just does n't believe in kidding herself . Of the acting challenge presented by King Arthur , she says , " I had to work out physically quite a bit , but pretty much it 's scream a lot and enjoy being painted blue . " ( Her Guinevere wears so much blue war paint that she looks like the world 's most ferocious Smurf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bend It Like Beckham and her beatific cameo in Love Actually . Few actresses talk as frankly about the artistic limits of their work or as exuberantly about their physical imperfections . ( Knightley likes to point out her acne for those who ca n't see it . ) Few actresses also refuse to hire a personal assistant on the grounds that it would feel " absurd " to do so . Yet all this self-deprecation may explain why she 's a burgeoning star . " She really does lack pretense , " says Bruckheimer . " I 'm a big believer that if you project somebody on a 100-foot screen , you look into their soul . Keira appreciates everything she gets , and she does n't take herself seriously . Believe me , the audience sees that . Honesty and believability make movie stars . She 's got both . " <P> By sunnily questioning her talent and not approaching each role with a cyborgian ambition to be the next Julia Roberts , Knightley has separated herself a bit from the ever expanding galaxy of post-adolescent It girls ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim to actually being the next Julia Roberts . Knightley has Roberts ' angular frame , avenue-wide smile and unforced sass , and she 's grateful for what she calls the " insane and ridiculous luck I 've had getting these big roles , " but she does not possess the genetic code to be happy as a full-time romantic heroine  --  pirate thwacker . ( To date , she is a holdout from the Pirates sequel . ) What she would rather do is " keep learning , do strange things , keep pushing to get better . "
