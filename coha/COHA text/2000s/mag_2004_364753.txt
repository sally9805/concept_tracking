Doctors used to joke that the best way to combat obesity was to build up your biceps ... in order to push yourself away from the table . Then came the discovery in 1995 of genes that regulate leptin , the hormone that controls how much fat your body stores . Since then , scientists have identified dozens of compounds related to weight , some released in the brain and others in the gut . <P> All of which has set off a pharmaceutical feeding frenzy , because every compound scientists can identify as weight related represents a potential target for drug development . And any drug that can safely prevent or reduce weight gain is not only a potential blockbuster but a lifesaver as well . <P> Finding those drugs , however , wo n't be easy . Weight may be a single number , but it represents the sum of a bewildering network of overlapping metabolic pathways , all designed to protect the body from starvation by packing on as many pounds as possible . In addition , not everybody gains weight the same way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all overweight people . " The whole feeding mechanism is a survival mechanism , and it is strongly defended for that purpose , " explains Ken Batchelor of GlaxoSmithKline . " What we are attempting to do with pharmacology is to reverse that process . " <P> Scientists are channeling their efforts toward two main targets : the feeding center in the brain , which is supposed to tell the body when to eat and how much , and the myriad signals that originate in the gut and then flow into the brain , triggered by the amount of food you eat . These messages order the body to burn calories right away or store them as fat for later use . <P> On the eating side , researchers at Glaxo are studying cholecystokinin , which is released by the intestines after a meal to signal the brain that the body has had enough . Giving obese patients a synthetic form of cholecystokinin before meals tricks the body into feeling full , so patients eat less . About 25% of the participants in an early trial lost almost 7 lbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regeneron , based in New York , are tapping into the same feeding hub in the brain but through a different protein that is more closely related to leptin . Regeneron 's agent , Axokine , fools the brain into thinking that the body 's fat stores are well stocked , short-circuiting the need to eat . People who took Axokine and stayed on a low-calorie diet and exercise program lost twice as much weight as those who relied on diet and exercise alone . <P> At Pfizer , researchers have stumbled upon an agent that curbs the brain 's attraction to fatty foods  --  but so far , only in mice . More studies will show if the same effect occurs in people .
