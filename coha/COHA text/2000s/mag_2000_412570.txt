HOW CAN I SEE MORE ANIMALS WHEN I RIDE ? // A human on a bike is nearly an animal . Dogs chase us because we 're the shape and speed of prey , and horses are spooked by us because we resemble predators-fast and silent ( at least those of us who know anything about chain lube ) . Do enough riding and you blunder into animal stories only another cyclist will believe . Riders we know have hit ( or hopped over ) armadillos , rattlesnakes , tarantulas , bats , giraffes ( really ) , turtles , tuna ( do n't ask-it 's barely believable even to us ) , lemurs , wild pigs , goats , and of course there was that nasty incident involving a Giro Boreas and a flying squirrel . My personal file includes kangaroos jumping across my front wheel , the smell of Yukon bear so thick it clogged my nostrils , howler monkeys in Venezuela hurting all manner of organic matter at me from the thick canopy above and rutting deer waking me in the middle of the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across America , I 've been scared by several big , hairy beasts-one named Tiny tried to show me his tattoo . But my all-time most frightening encounter is a tale of fear , feathers and loafing . I found myself a quarter of a mile down an isolated road on a chilly New Hampshire afternoon , searching for a quaint log cabin I 'd been told overlooked a placid lake . At the bottom of the muddy hill where I stopped , a goose waddled from behind some scrub , squawking louder than a 747 . A watch-goose . I laughed . Several more appeared , hissing and bobbing their heads like out-of-control windup toys , and my laughter faltered . In all , six geese materialized before I had my bike pointed back up the hill . I never made it . The birds reached me before I even had my feet in the toeclips . I abandoned my bike and fled toward a tree , thick orange beaks pecking me as I went . Dogs might have gotten bored and given up the lonely watch . Geese know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the next hour , treed by geese . Animal encounters-even the ones that remain purely visual-strike something primal in us . They make for great stories . They remind us that cycling is about more than getting fit or getting someplace .
