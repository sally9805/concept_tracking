Los Angeles ' Insatiable Thirst For Water , Which Drained The Owens Valley , Has Ruined Lives , Shaped The City 's Politics And Provoked Ongoing Controversy <p> At the moment , Chris Plakos is a little embarrassed . The public relations manager for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is looking for a river he ca n't find . We 're driving down a road 200 miles from Los Angeles , in the Owens Valley , which parallels the Sierra Nevada for about 100 miles . Plakos ' employer owns most of this valley , having obtained it decades ago by means that may fairly be called ruthless . Plakos wants to show me how , these days , the municipal utility has become more enlightened toward the region and its residents . <p> We know the river is east of us , so it should be a simple matter of pointing the rented SUV in that direction . But we are caught in a whiteout caused not by snow but by salt , blowing off a dry lake bed to the south . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which at high doses have been shown to cause cancer in animals . <p> We keep the windows rolled up tight . <p> Plakos is also embarrassed because the salt-out is traceable to his employer 's past policies , and the utility , in a historic turnaround after decades of hostility and acrimony , recently agreed to do something about the problem . So he does n't need this possibly toxic atmospheric pollution just now . These dust storms , which have long plagued the area whenever the wind is just so , arise from Owens Lake . Once a shallow 110-square-mile body of briny water that still managed to support an abundance of grasses , birds and other wildlife , it was drained decades ago by L.A. 's seemingly bottomless demand for water , transforming the lake into a vast , dusty , cracked-white patch of high desert . It 's the most visible casualty in the battle for the water that turned Los Angeles into a major metropolis  --  a battle about to be rejoined as the city eyes untapped water sources beneath the Mojave Desert . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate or the $31 billion a year the entertainment industry generates for the city that makes Los Angeles possible . It 's water . Without it , the town one newcomer in the 1860s called a " vile little dump " ( pop . 13,000 ) would never have evolved into the second most populous city in the United States . <p> L.A. 's 19th-century movers and shakers knew that the city 's health and prosperity depended upon the availability of freshwater . Los Angeles sits on a semiarid coastal plain , with desert on three sides and the Pacific Ocean on the fourth . Freshwater was limited to the meager flow of the Los Angeles River , now a much-maligned concrete channel , and the paltry 15 inches of rain that the area averages a year . <p> The spigot for Los Angeles is located north of Owens Lake and the small town of Independence , off US 395 and down a mile of bad road . It consists of nothing more than two 20-foot-long concrete blocks . Here , on the eastern slope of the Sierra 4,000 feet above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meander the valley 's entire length before emptying into Owens Lake , smacks abruptly into a concrete barricade . Then it is directed to a manmade , arrow-straight dirt channel . <p> This is the gateway of the Los Angeles Aqueduct . Nearly a century ago an army of 5,000 men used dynamite , steam shovels , dredging machines and mules to dig out 233 miles of canals and tunnels . They carved the aqueduct out of unforgiving terrain , laying pipe across searing stretches of desert and going over , and often through , solid Sierra rock . Completed in 1913 , the aqueduct still carries up to 315 million gallons of water a day to thirsty Angelenos . <p> You might think this engineering marvel worthy of notice . After all , it is largely responsible for the Southern California of today , as well as the ever-innovating city that has shaped so much of American life and world culture . But there 's no roadside attraction here , no plaque , no visitors . Just wind , the gurgle of water and the occasional distant whine of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etched into one of the concrete walls : " A.D. MCMXI , LOS ANGELES AQUEDUCT INTAKE . " <p> The low profile likely reflects the fact that as the aqueduct carried away the valley 's water , it also carried away the local economy . It left Owens Valley farmers and ranchers high and dry . They responded with lawsuits , protests-and finally , dynamite of their own . <p> The Owens Valley water war has provoked impassioned debate and been the subject of numerous books . It also provided the backstory to the 1974 film Chinatown , which , though fiction , has contributed to the popular perception that Los Angeles raped the Owens Valley . Others contend that the area 's economics were spiraling downward anyway and that California 's future lay inevitably on its southern coast . The truth , as usual , is more complicated . <p> To be sure , a critical part of the aqueduct story is the tale of wealthy Los Angeles businessmen speculating in real estate . They included Harrison Gray Otis and his son-in-law , Harry Chandler , owner and publisher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harriman , president of the Southern Pacific railroad ; and Moses Sherman , a real estate developer and member of the city 's water board , which established policy for this utility . Otis would use the Times ' considerable influence to rally support for the aqueduct . Most historians believe that Otis and his colleagues engaged in shadowy dealings and traded on inside information , learning ahead of the public ( probably from Sherman ) where the aqueduct would terminate and where excess water would be stored  --  in the water table under the San Fernando Valley , adjacent to Los Angeles . All told , Otis and his colleagues bought 16,000 acres of this valley , which they later sold at a handsome profit . <p> But the main story of the greening of Los Angeles centers on two other men : William Mulholland and Frederick Eaton . Different as night and day , they were warm friends before becoming bitter enemies . Without their efforts , the aqueduct would not have been built ; yet the project would prove to be each man 's undoing . <p> An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall with curly hair and a bushy mustache . He was in his 20s when he settled in L.A. in the late 1870s , after stints as a sailor , dry goods merchant and lumberjack . His first job in the city  --  at $1.50 per day  --  was as a deputy zanjero , or irrigation ditch tender , with the privately owned Los Angeles Water Company . But Mulholland was too ambitious to remain a zanjero for long . Teaching himself mathematics , hydraulics and geology , he became a hydraulic engineer within two years , foreman within eight , and then , at 31 , superintendent , a position he retained after the city purchased the water company . <p> For some of that time his boss was Frederick Eaton , a Los Angeles native raised in a well-to-do family . In contrast to the rough-hewn Mulholland , Eaton was sophisticated and polished . He loved his native city , serving as superintendent and chief engineer of the L.A. Water Company and then , from 1898 to 1900 , as mayor of L.A. <p> By 1900 , L.A. 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mere decade earlier . By 1904 , the figure had again nearly doubled . As the population rose , the water table began to drop . Some estimates suggested that the Los Angeles River would provide enough water for no more than 250,000 people . Both Eaton and Mulholland realized an entirely new source was needed . <p> Mulholland began looking throughout Southern California for an alternative supply of freshwater , but it was Fred Eaton who came up with a solution . On a camping trip to the Sierra in the early 1890s , Eaton had gazed down upon Owens Lake and thought about all the freshwater flowing into it and going to waste . Yes , Los Angeles was some 200 miles away , but it was all downhill . All one would have to do to move it to the city was dig some canals , lay some pipe and let gravity do the rest . Furthermore , he realized , several streams flowing out of the Sierra could be used to generate hydroelectric power . Imagine , a 200-plus-mile aqueduct running downhill to L.A. and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades , as his civic interest joined his personal financial interests , Eaton grew increasingly evangelical about Owens Valley water . <p> In September 1904 , he took Mulholland to Owens Valley with only " a mule team , a buckboard , and a demijohn of whiskey , " Mulholland later recalled . Despite the hooch , it was the water and not the whiskey that made a believer out of Mulholland . He readily endorsed Eaton 's proposal to build an aqueduct . Eaton , meanwhile , was buying water options from Owens Valley ranchers and farmers whose pastures bordered the river , without disclosing the city 's plan . He also purchased a 23,000-acre cattle ranch in Long Valley , most of which he hoped to sell to the city , at a tidy profit , for use as an aqueduct reservoir . <p> Historians differ on Eaton 's motives . Some say he duped Owens Valley residents . Others say his purchases , though cunning , were justifiable because they benefited the city , which lacked the money to buy the land until voters later approved a $1.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied charges that he acted duplicitously . <p> Grandson John Eaton , who until a year ago lived on one of the last acres of land in Long Valley passed down from his father , Harold Eaton , believes that his grandfather had no need to double-deal . " People were seeking him out to sell their property , " he says . " They saw him as this crazy millionaire who wanted to become a cattle baron and who was foolishly overpaying for land . And they wanted to get out . " It was a hardscrabble life , what with the valley 's short growing season , and the playing out of local gold and silver mines , the market for its produce . Of course , had the sellers known the buyer in the shadows was the city of Los Angeles , they would n't have sold their land so cheaply , if at all . <p> In any event , when the ranchers and farmers learned the real story in 1905  --  " Titanic Project to Give the City a River " headlined the Los Angeles Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave town for awhile . <p> The construction of the aqueduct , under the direction of Mulholland , proceeded quickly . To provide power for electric shovels , he erected two hydroelectric plants  --  still in use today  --  on creeks that dump into the Owens River . He also built some 500 miles of roads , ran telephone and telegraph lines across 150 miles of desert , and laid down 268 miles of pipe to provide drinking water for the workers . <p> Conditions were harsh . Temperatures in the Mojave Desert could swing 80 degrees in a single day . " In the winter , it was just as windy and bitter cold as it was hot in summer , " Raymond Taylor , the aqueduct 's medical director , said at the time . Over the six years of construction on the aqueduct , 43 men died out of the 5,000 or so who worked on it , a toll that some experts say was rather low considering the scope of the project and the rugged terrain . <p> On November 5 , 1913 , Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminus in the San Fernando Valley , with parades , fireworks and speeches , including a famously terse one from Mulholland : " There it is , " he said , as the gates opened , " take it . " <p> Eaton did not attend . His years of dreams of a real estate empire had come to naught . Mulholland had balked at Eaton 's price for the Long Valley land , which most historians peg at $1 million  --  and refused to pay it . Consequently , the completed aqueduct at first had no reservoir in the Long Valley area . <p> For a time , life in Owens Valley remained largely unaffected by the aqueduct . Most farming and ranching took place at the valley 's northern end , above the aqueduct 's intake point , so the river still provided plenty of water . Valley produce still found a market , however reduced , at local mines , many of which were still operating . <p> But things changed . People continued to pour into Los Angeles , and several years of drought in the 1920s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city began pumping groundwater directly from the aquifer beneath Owens Valley . Starved of water , local farms and ranches failed . Businesses followed . Some Owens Valley farmers sued Los Angeles and lost . Others began taking water directly from the aqueduct . The city countered by buying valley property in a checkerboard fashion  --  purchasing one farm but not the one next to it , which pitted neighbor against neighbor . <p> Owens Valley residents took matters into their own hands at 1:30 A.M. on May 21 , 1924 . A caravan of cars with about 40 men set out from Bishop , the largest town in Owens Valley , headed 60 miles south , and just north of Lone Pine , dynamited the aqueduct 's concrete canal . Six months later , a number of Owens Valley residents , led by local banker Mark Watterson , seized the aqueduct 's Alabama Gates spillway , near Lone Pine and opened its gates , sending the precious liquid back into the Owens River . <p> Mulholland was furious . He dispatched two carloads of gun-toting city detectives to break up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valley sheriff warned them not to start trouble , saying , " I do n't believe you will live to tell the tale . " The detectives backed down . Soon local families arrived at the spillway , some bearing food ; picnic blankets were spread and a huge barbecue ensued . Movie cowboy Tom Mix , shooting a film on location nearby , sent over his mariachi band to perform . The press arrived and took pictures . In the meantime , Watterson 's brother , Wilfred , also a banker , went to L.A. and appeared before the Los Angeles Joint Clearinghouse Association , a group of bankers , asking for a new commission to negotiate city payments to the valley . When the bankers agreed , the siege ended peacefully . <p> But negotiations between the commission and Owens Valley locals , represented by the Wattersons , dragged on . In December 1924 , Wilfred Watterson presented the commission with two invoices , one for $5.3 million in reparations to ranchers , the other for $12 million to purchase the remaining land in the valley . The commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew . Litigation ensued , but stalled in the courts . The city bought more valley land , displacing farmers and ruining more local businesses . Finally , valley frustrations reached another boiling point . On May 20 , 1927 , several men detonated explosives outside Mojave , 100 miles north of L.A. , destroying a part of the aqueduct . A few days later , more blasts rocked the aqueduct farther north and , on June 4 , still another . A train filled with L.A. detectives armed with Winchester carbines was sent to guard the aqueduct . <p> Though the detectives had no legal right to do so , they placed Owens Valley under martial law . It did n't help . Over the next two months , seven more blasts occurred at sites along the aqueduct , from Mojave in the south to Bishop in the north , damaging pipes ' and a power plant and downing telegraph lines . <p> In the end , what broke the valley 's spirit was malfeasance by two of its own . In August , the Watterson brothers ( whose bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were later convicted on 36 counts . Some said the brothers had merely been trying to stay afloat financially , and helping others stay afloat , by moving money from one business account to another , recording deposits never made and debits already paid . Their defenders pointed out that none of the money ever left Inyo County . The state 's prosecuting attorney , an Owens Valley local and a friend of the brothers , was said to have cried while delivering his final argument . The Wattersons were sentenced to ten years in San Quentin and their five banks closed . Posted on the door of one was the message : " This result has been brought about by the last four years of destructive work carried on by the city of Los Angeles . " <p> Fred Eaton , whose plan to sell his Long Valley ranch was stymied by the city , now had worse problems . His son Harold had mortgaged it to the Wattersons ' bank in loans totaling $320,000 . When the bank failed , the ranch went into receivership and the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered ten years earlier . <p> Eaton died in 1934 at age 78 , his dreams of fortune unfulfilled . " He was bitter , " says his grandson John Eaton , " because he felt he 'd been made the goat for all the troubles that came to ail the Owens Valley , and because he felt he never got the proper credit for his role in the creation of the aqueduct . " <p> Mulholland , for his part , died a chastened man at 79 , a year after Eaton 's death . A dam that Mulholland had built in San Francisquito Canyon , outside Los Angeles , collapsed in 1928 , less than 12 hours after he had inspected it and pronounced it sound . A wall of water 100 feet high roared down the canyon , sweeping away trees , homes , cars , a railroad trestle and animals , and killing at least 400 people . Mulholland , although cleared of wrongdoing , blamed himself . He soon retired from the water department and became a virtual recluse , a " stooped and silent " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( In the 1990s , David Rogers , a forensic geologist who studied the dam rupture , concluded that while there were some flaws in the construction , it was a massive landslide that felled the dam . ) <p> Today most of the people residing in the Owens Valley make their living from tourism , with the majority of skiers , fishermen , campers and so on coming from ( where else ? ) Los Angeles . Some ranches and farms still exist , but most of their fields are leased from the L.A. Department of Water and Power . The bulk of Owens Valley land is empty , its former vitality reduced to groupings of shade trees where houses once stood ; long , V-shaped ditches , once used to water fields , now dusty and weed choked ; an occasional concrete silo surrounded by sagebrush . <p> The aqueduct was extended north another 100 miles in the 1940s , to a second large body of water , Mono Lake . Another entire aqueduct was built in 1970 alongside Mulholland 's . Almost 100 years have passed since William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Water and Power engineers , the mandate is still the same : keep the water coming . <p> I 'm standing somewhere in the middle of Owens Lake  --  white , cracked , powder-dry and stretching off in every direction  --  with Ted Schade , an engineer and senior project manager for a tiny regional agency , the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District . The agency is responsible for enforcing the federal Clean Air Act in Owens Valley , and thanks largely to it , things here are looking up . <p> Right now , the wind is still , and it 's OK to breathe . Yesterday , upwind and north of the lake , I saw a huge white cloud boiling off the lake bed . According to the Environmental Protection Agency , when the wind blows , this lake is the single largest source of particulate matter pollution in the United States . <p> Schade 's agency has been David to the Los Angeles utility 's Goliath since the mid-1980s , when the city , responding to a California state law , was required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and figure out how best to stop the pollution ( which meant , in effect , that the city paid the salaries of its antagonists ) . In 1997 , Schade 's group approved a plan that ordered the city to flood the dry lake bed with water or grow a salt-tolerant grass . Where the water came from was up to the city , but of course , the only readily available water was from the aqueduct . " The city just went crazy , " says Schade . " They filed a lawsuit , tried to withhold money , and appealed the plan to the state of California . " <p> Then the utility 's new general manager , S. David Freeman ( now California Governor Gray Davis ' energy czar ) , called a truce . " He just said what the city was doing was wrong , " says Schade , " and within a couple of weeks we had an agreement . " Grudgingly , the city agreed to have ten square miles of dust control measures in place by 2001 , with incremental improvements after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the aqueduct 's precious water had begun ; by January 2002 , more than 7,600 acres of dusty Owens Lake bed had been submerged in a few inches of water . But more remains to be done . In other sections of the lake bed , the city is currently planting more than 2,600 acres with hardy native grass that tolerates high salt and both freezing and blistering temperatures . The project is scheduled to be complete by 2006 , by which time Los Angeles should have implemented dust control measures on more than 14,000 acres of Owens Lake bed , using about 50,000 acre-feet of water a year , enough to supply almost a quarter of a million people . <p> If water politics in Southern California today are no longer as rough-and-tumble as in Mulholland 's era , controversy continues to surround the struggle to meet the demand for water in the fast-growing region . <p> In one recent flap , water officials representing the greater Los Angeles area have struck a preliminary agreement with a private firm that owns large parcels of the Mojave Desert and controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inc. , proposes to service Southern California by pumping water out of the aquifer as well as using it to store water diverted from the Colorado River . The project , though approved by the Department of the Interior , still faces opposition from California Senator Dianne Feinstein and some environmentalists . In stating their concerns that drawing water from the aquifer will damage the fragile desert ecosystem , opponents also note that the aquifer runs under two dry lakes , and specifically cited what happened to Owens Lake as an example of what could go wrong . <p> Maybe that will be Owens Lake 's legacy , says Schade : an object lesson for what not to do .
