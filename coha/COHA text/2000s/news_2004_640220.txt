<p> Arrogance , ignorance <p> Democrats who fear Ralph Nader 's candidacy have , as FDR said , only fear itself to fear . Democrats still can not accept that no one but Bill Clinton and Al Gore were to blame for having lost the 2000 election . <p> The Democrats snatched defeat from the jaws of victory because of a divisive and arrogant campaign . Yet they persist with the same today . <p> Notice , too , how the Democrats and media seldom mention that fiscally conservative H. Ross Perot won 20 percent and then 13 percent of the popular vote in 1992 and 1996 , helping Clinton to two less- <p> than-majority victories , while Nader took less than 4 percent of the vote in 2000 . <p> MIKE SPANIOLA <p> Vail <p> Criticism went too far <p> Re : ' Official likens teachers union to terrorists , ' Feb. 24 news story . <p> In a meeting of the nation 's governors at the White House on Monday , Education Secretary Rod Paige called the National Education Association a ' terrorist organization . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Washington , D.C.-based headquarters and not to the nation 's teachers . Nevertheless , the damage has been done . <p> The NEA is the teachers that make up its membership , pure and simple . By accusing the NEA of being a terrorist organization , Paige has , intentionally or not , implied that each of the teachers it represents is , in effect , a terrorist . The United States knows very well the true face of terrorism , and the NEA is not it . Given the events since Sept. 11 , and our country 's subsequent war on terrorism , such accusations are not only intolerable and inaccurate but irresponsible as well . <p> I am a teacher and a member of the NEA , but I am most certainly not connected with any sort of terrorist organization , be it real or imagined . I am not a terrorist , nor are my colleagues . We are professionals doing the best that we can to ensure a proper education for each student who comes through our classroom door . <p> Public criticism of education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for longer than I have been teaching . Teachers in general and the NEA in particular have been the constant targets of that criticism , and to a certain degree , teachers have learned to cope with the criticism , if not accept it . Nevertheless , Paige 's comments went beyond criticism . They were an insult to anyone who teaches , be they a member of the NEA or not . <p> SARAH STEINBACH-BALL <p> Denver <p> Ending the confusion <p> Re : ' Bush : Ban gay marriage ; Despite president 's call , amendment faces obstacles , ' Feb. 25 news story . <p> I 'm glad to see President Bush has stated he wants to end ' growing confusion ' and that he ' believes it is important to have clarity ' on the issue of marriage . Good thing , because I am definitely confused . <p> Let 's look at some of the other groups that are allowed to marry . Convicted murderers ? No problem ; you can even get married while doing your time . Child molesters ? Just live out your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to church with your beloved . Wife beaters and child beaters ? Step right up ; the path to marriage is clear for you . Third or fourth time to take your lifetime vows ? Hey , everyone makes mistakes . <p> But gays ? No way . They might crack the sacred foundation of one of the most valued traditions in our nation by forcing their lifestyles on us . Next thing you know , we 'll all be forced to attend a weekly gay marriage dressed in pink ballerina tutus and watch ' Will &; Grace ' every night . <p> The issue comes down to this : Is America truly the land of equality and justice for all ? Or will we allow the intolerant to dump on the single most important document in our country , the Constitution ? <p> RICHARD SMITH <p> Fort Collins <p> Government is n't God <p> It seems to me that the Federal Marriage Amendment is specifically written to allow civil unions in states that so choose them . But what is marriage , in the eyes of the state , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage is sanctification before God . In order to maintain the separation of church and state , and prevent the codification of bigotry into the hallowed Constitution , I suggest an alternative to the amendment that recognizes all unions between two parties ( marriage and otherwise ) as civil unions . We who would like to get married before God need to do it at our place of worship , not the county courthouse . <p> DONALD MEYER <p> Denver <p> A step back in time <p> President Bush said he will support a constitutional amendment saying marriage can only be between a man and a woman . Homosexuals , therefore , are relegated to second-class citizenship , just as women and blacks were in the past . My , how we 've progressed . What exactly is the threat ? <p> As long as we 've returned to the days when we codify the various degrees of freedom and citizenship of parts of our population , why not make this amendment comprehensive and include Democrats , anybody who is not an evangelical Christian , any woman who has ever had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past or in the future , questioned going to war ? If we are going to have despotism , let 's go all the way ! <p> It appears this constitutional proposal is about a word - ' marriage . ' Apparently , some kind of civil arrangements will be allowed as long as they are not called marriages . What it really is , though , is a statement that homosexuals are to be officially considered aberrant and less than human . This is the most blatant pandering to a significant part of the president 's electoral base imaginable and is an affront to the significance of the Constitution and everything our country supposedly stands for . What 's next , a revival of the Ku Klux Klan ? <p> JOHN BORGEN <p> Grand Junction <p> Equal representation ? <p> President Bush said that the issue of same-sex marriage can not be left to the courts to decide . However , when he took office , he was quite happy to leave the issue of his election to the courts . It is absurd to allow the far right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not second-class citizens . They pay more taxes than most . Are they getting equal protection under the law ? <p> TOM WATSON <p> Denver <p> Issue confuses law <p> The gay-marriage issue is being covered poorly and distorted by the media . What societal benefit can result from legal acceptance of same-sex marriage ? <p> What is being ignored is that pension law , health insurance law , real estate law , partnership law , inheritance law , life insurance law , tax law and divorce law will all be upset by legal acceptance of same-sex marriage . These issues are hardly mentioned in media coverage of the subject . <p> ERNEST J. LAWINGER <p> Dillon <p> It 's about being fair <p> Re : ' From two couples , a couple of views , ' Feb. 25 news story . <p> I think Jonathan and Jennifer Jameson are a shining example of the path and behavior that all Christians should display . They show a keen understanding of fairness , love , tolerance and all basic Christian values . They admittedly do n't agree with homosexuality or gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also accept that they are not perfect , and that they are in no position to judge the personal lives of others . It was perfectly stated in the article when the couple explained that having a constitutional ban on gay marriages is not going to stop people from practicing homosexuality . Nobody is asking anyone to agree with gays or their lifestyles . The whole issue is simply an issue of fairness and legality . <p> RYAN SPRADLIN <p> Colorado Springs <p> Questions for Owens <p> Re : ' Owens speaks out on gay nuptials ; Governor fears state may have to recognize homosexual marriages from other states , ' Feb. 20 news story . <p> Well , well , well , well , well , the governor finally opines about the gay-marriage situation in San Francisco and Massachusetts . Up to now , we , your loyal subjects , have kept quiet about your marital problems , but now that you 've shown your own hypocrisy , you 're going to have to answer a few questions : <p> 1 . What exactly is the status of your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' undermine ' your traditional marriage ? <p> 3 . Why would you consider throwing stones when you 're living in a glass house ? <p> DIETER ZERRESSEN <p> Denver <p> To Reach Us <p> Phone : 303-820-1331 <p> Fax : 303-820-1502 <p> E-mail : openforum@denverpost.com ( Please send straight text , not attachments . ) <p> Mail : The Open Forum , The Denver Post , 1560 Broadway , Denver 80202 <p> Letters guidelines : The Post welcomes letters of up to 200 words on topics of general interest .
