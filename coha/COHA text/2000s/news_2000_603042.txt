<p> &lt;&gt; State and federal investigators are trying to trace the source of a pungent gas that experts say attacks the lungs and brain . Townsfolk point to the USA 's largest beef processor , IBP . And a USA TODAY investigation finds a long history of alleged environmental misconduct . &lt;&gt; <p> LEXINGTON , Neb.  --  White clapboard houses , faded and peeling , paint a ghostly outline of this small town on the Great Plains where the world 's largest meatpacker , IBP , kills one head of cattle every 11 seconds . <p> Originally known as Iowa Beef Packers , IBP today employs about one-quarter of Lexington 's population  --  2,300 workers  --  and exports prime beef worldwide . But the stench of burning blood , bristle and bone lingers in the western Nebraska air . <p> And the vast skyline once limned by green haze from the town 's abandoned alfalfa mill is tainted now by an invisible toxic cloud that burns residents ' throats and leaves a bitter taste on their lips . <p> Some Lexington parents say they keep their children inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be seen pulling tanks of oxygen as they amble through Wal-Mart . One farmer , on land near IBP 's waste lagoon , talks of doubling over to vomit because of the stench . <p> " It 's a dead , heavy , nauseating smell . It makes you sick to your stomach , " says Bertha " Tootie " Carroll , who lives on a farm 1 1/2 miles southeast of the IBP plant . <p> " It smells like money , " responds Tim Shively of BHA Real Estate , repeating a shopworn joke on Main Street . <p> Nebraska officials say the chemical component of Lexington 's putrid air is hydrogen sulfide , a byproduct of organic decay in cattle-feed lots , the city sewer system and IBP 's slaughterhouse . Hydrogen sulfide corrodes the lungs and starves the brain of oxygen required to process new information and recall the past , experts say . <p> The state says it ca n't pinpoint IBP as the primary source of hydrogen sulfide , whose toxicity first was identified in the deaths of mid-19th century sewer workers in Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it plans to spend $ 3 million to cover a waste lagoon at the edge of town . <p> But in another Nebraska town where IBP does business , the federal government is taking action in a lawsuit prosecutors say could affect IBP plants throughout the Great Plains . On Jan. 12 , the Justice Department filed a lawsuit accusing IBP of violating federal air , water and hazardous waste laws at the company 's flagship plant and former headquarters in Dakota City . <p> The Justice Department , acting on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency , alleges IBP emitted up to 1,800 pounds of hydrogen sulfide a day in Dakota City without notifying federal regulators . Disclosure is required for hydrogen sulfide emissions greater than 100 pounds a day , the government says . <p> The lawsuit also alleges that IBP exceeded the federal Clean Water Act by dumping excessive ammonia into the Missouri River since at least 1988 . <p> The Justice Department says it intervened after state officials failed to stem the company 's tide of environmental abuses . <p> " This case presents a pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoidance of environmental regulations , " says U.S. Attorney Thomas Monaghan . " We will hold them accountable . " <p> IBP denies the charges . In response to questions from USA TODAY , IBP spokesman Gary Mickelson said the Justice Department can not prove IBP 's hydrogen sulfide emissions were excessive . <p> " During the period in question , " Mickelson said , " IBP was not required to measure air emissions from ... non-specific , non-point sources such as lagoons and manhole covers within its operations . Without such data , it was impossible to know if any air-quality exceedances were taking place . " <p> Mickelson added : " The ammonia levels in the treated water we release into the river do not cause an adverse environmental impact . " <p> In an interview with USA TODAY in September , IBP CEO Robert Peterson said : " We have no intention of harming the environment . We have every intention of living within the rules . " And IBP told the Securities and Exchange Commission in a March 1999 filing that it was in " substantial compliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But regulatory records reviewed by USA TODAY show the EPA repeatedly warned IBP from September 1998 to January 1999 that it violated federal air , land and water laws in Nebraska . <p> More broadly , court records and regulatory filings reviewed under Public Records Act requests in several states outline a 20-year history of alleged environmental misconduct by IBP : <p> * Idaho . State Division of Environmental Quality records show that IBP 's meatpacking plant near Boise exceeded regulatory wastewater guidelines by up to 1,200% , and the plant 's use of nitrogen waste as fertilizer exceeded regulatory guidelines by up to 500% before the company negotiated broader waste limits and improved treatment systems in December 1998 . <p> IBP 's Mickelson says , " Exceeding these guidelines is not a violation of the law or our permit , nor were we ever cited by the ( state ) . " <p> State officials say IBP did violate the company 's permit , in part by failing to monitor local groundwater for nitrate-waste poisoning . Idaho officials also say IBP wastewater , aerated by sprinklers , contained massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered imposing a consent order on IBP , according to a December 1998 internal report that cited " several unresolved compliance issues . " Instead , the state agreed to issue IBP a new environmental permit that accommodates the company 's production requirements with added operating safeguards and enforcement provisions . <p> * Illinois . The state attorney general seeks to fine IBP up to $ 10,000 a day for six years for alleged violations of the state 's odor law at the company 's Joslin plant . Illinois residents ' complaints of irritated throats , nausea and difficulty breathing parallel hydrogen sulfide-related concerns in Nebraska . IBP is contesting the regulatory action in court . <p> * Nebraska . After the EPA began inquiring about hydrogen sulfide emissions , IBP recalculated its 1994 , 1995 and 1996 state air records , and , in June 1998 , submitted corrected data " along with its appropriate fees , " regulatory records show . <p> In addition , the Justice Department says , IBP incorrectly filed or failed to file federal toxic-air reports at several plants in Iowa , Nebraska and Kansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' largest polluters and has been cited for several environmental failings , EPA records show . <p> IBP comes to town <p> Two dozen empty storefronts lined Main Street when IBP opened its Lexington slaughterhouse in November 1990 . <p> Shop owners parked in front of surviving businesses to lend the appearance of prosperity . Some homeowners , unable to pay their mortgages , greeted bank officials with their keys and walked away . <p> IBP officials arrived as heroes who would resuscitate the downtrodden local farm economy . During a town hall meeting , IBP Vice President Troy Calhoun soothed residents ' environmental concerns by saying , " Odor does not have to be objectionable either to people within our plant ( or in ) the environment in which they work . " <p> Calhoun described slaughter waste as smelling like " rotten wood . It is a wet , musty , I often use the term ' sweet , ' pervasive odor . " <p> Each year since moving to town , the company increased beef production and employment . It now contributes $ 58 million to the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at IBP did n't stay long . It is hard , dangerous work at pay that starts slightly above the minimum wage . <p> Soon , busloads of workers from California , Texas , Mexico and Guatemala rolled into town . The demographic shift galvanized major changes in Lexington neighborhoods and schools . <p> Meanwhile , Lexington developed one of the highest crime rates in Nebraska . Last year , Lexington police recorded an arrest rate of 100 per 1,000 residents , nearly double the state average . <p> " In less than two years , IBP hired and terminated a labor force equal to 76% " of the town 's 1990 population , according to research of state revenue records by anthropologists Lourdes Gouviea at the University of Nebraska and Donald Stoll at the University of Kansas . <p> And unease with IBP 's environmental record grew . Nebraska regulatory files are filled with anonymous complaints such as this in December 1997 : " Have been sick ever since they moved in . The smell is just terrible . " <p> Citizens investigate <p> In Dakota City , a citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushing regulators to respond . <p> Modlin , 52 , a grandmother who manages her husband Ken 's business as an electrician , lives alongside the Missouri River , a mile from IBP waste lagoons . She attributes family members ' burning lungs , persistent fatigue and mood swings to hydrogen sulfide emissions at the IBP plant . <p> Eventually , she persuaded state regulators to visit her home to inspect copper plumbing that was black and crusted from oxidation . Officials also documented oxidation on the fence surrounding IBP lagoons , according to their inspection notes . <p> " All it takes is one person bringing in one doorknob that is corroded or tarnished to make you know you 've got something you should look at , " says Michael Linder , director of the Nebraska Division of Environmental Quality . <p> The federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry also investigated . In December 1997 , it concluded that Modlin 's concerns were " valid . " <p> The agency , an arm of the Department of Health and Human Services , said hydrogen sulfide results " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poses " a threat to public health , especially to those with pre-existing respiratory problems and those located closest to the potential fallout areas . " The agency now is undertaking a long-term study of hydrogen sulfide 's health effects in Dakota City and Lexington . <p> The Justice Department , seeking quicker results , retained Kaye Kilburn , head of environmental medicine at the University of Southern California , to assess the potential impact of IBP 's hydrogen sulfide emissions on a group of two to three dozen Dakota City residents . <p> Kilburn , interviewed before he became a government consultant , says hydrogen sulfide gradually destroys humans ' ability to breathe by converting an oxygen-carrying , iron-containing enzyme in the body to ferrous sulfide , which is akin to " fool 's gold . " <p> " You 're progressively dehumanized by the dose , " Kilburn says . " The evidence is pretty convincing that whether explosively or insidiously  --  at low doses  --  the effects ( of hydrogen sulfide ) are the same : It 's this progressive loss of brain . " <p> Infants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . Thus , some Dakota City residents were stunned when IBP offered last year to donate its former factory headquarters as a child day-care center after moving to a new campus in Dakota Dunes , S.D. <p> IBP 's Mickelson responds , " We believe this to be an excellent project that will benefit hundreds of area families . We are proud to be a part of this effort and would be extremely disappointed if it did not move forward . " <p> Witness bashing ? <p> Meanwhile , largely because of Modlin , Nebraska 's legislature enacted one of the country 's first laws to limit so-called Total Reduced Sulfurs , about 95% of which consist of hydrogen sulfide . The balance includes toxic methyl mercaptan , dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide . <p> Modlin 's public success met with private angst , however . <p> EPA records show that IBP asked Dakota City to investigate the councilwoman for conflicts of interest after she rallied public protest against the company . <p> The city investigated and found no conflict . <p> Company lawyer Bruce Smith also contacted the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chemist Donna Rhee , practiced law without a license when she petitioned to intervene in a state hearing on IBP 's plans to further expand the Dakota City tannery . The ethics complaint was referred to the Lincoln Police Department , which declined to press charges . <p> The EPA , in turn , accused IBP of " possible witness bashing " in a criminal referral to the agency 's enforcement division and inspector general , a copy of the referral shows . <p> " Big companies should not harass citizens for their participation in activities " in a public debate , wrote EPA Compliance Coordinator Cecil Ray Taylor . IBP denies wrongdoing . EPA declines to comment . <p> In December , Modlin was diagnosed with a brain tumor and is undergoing radiation treatment . No evidence correlates Modlin 's health problems to environmental concerns . And Modlin does not contend the two are related . However , she acknowledges , both weigh heavily on her . <p> A state air-quality monitor installed in Modlin 's home registered 2,873 violations of the new Total Reduced Sulfurs standard last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 times the legal limit , according to the Nebraska Division of Environmental Quality . <p> IBP says it is not the area 's only source of hydrogen sulfide . But rather than comply with state requests to quantify its emissions , the company offered to spend $ 10 million on environmental upgrades at the Dakota City tannery if the state would approve permits for a 50% increase in capacity . <p> When Nebraska regulators refused to approve the expansion , IBP responded by withholding the environmental improvements . <p> The standoff persisted for two years . One day before the Justice Department filed its lawsuit , IBP submitted a 2-foot stack of records it says are responsive to state regulators ' demands . In Washington , Justice Department attorney Deborah Reyher says , " That emissions data will prove the federal case , to the extent we need any more proof . " <p> ' How guilty ? ' <p> In Lexington , lawyer Greg Lauby parks his dented Buick with the missing hubcap on a gravel road near Tootie Carroll 's farm and the IBP waste lagoon . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air monitor at this site registered 1,766 violations of Nebraska 's Total Reduced Sulfurs standard last year . <p> Lauby , who considers himself a connoisseur of slaughterhouse smells , tilts his nose heavenward . " This smell  --  the H-2S  --  is like sewer gas , " says the attorney , 52 , who , like Modlin , devotes his personal time and resources to investigating IBP 's environmental record . " H-2S " is the scientific abbreviation for hydrogen sulfide gas . <p> " There 's another smell ; a greasy smell , " Lauby continues . That is IBP 's rendering of animal carcasses , he says . <p> " And then there is another one that is burning blood . <p> " I find all of them offensive at the levels they occur . But the only one I worry about the toxicity of is the H-2S . " <p> Lexington Police Chief Charles Clark , whose wife , Sandy , works as a security officer at the IBP plant in the town 's center , wrinkles his nose and says , " The state 's telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make an educated guess .

This lawsuit will benefit no one . It only further delays the environmental improvements we have been trying to make at Dakota City since 1997 . We also strongly refute the allegations stated in the government complaint . . . . <p> IBP and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early November reached an agreement to work out details for IBP to receive the permitting needed to make an estimated $ 13 million in environmental improvements , as well as to expand the plant 's hide tannery . However , by December , NDEQ officials unexpectedly backed out of the tentative agreement , indicating they need federal government concurrence before engaging in any permitting activity . <p> While we would still like to proceed with the Dakota City project in 2000 , it now appears this litigation will result in another missed construction season . We can not move forward without the necessary permits from the government . Our comprehensive package of environmental improvements will , in the end , be implemented . Why not sooner , rather than later ? . . . <p> * Air emissions . . . . Allegations about air quality exceedances in the Dakota City area need to be put into proper context . First , in a hearing challenging the validity of NDEQ 's TRS ( Total Reduced Sulfurs ) standard , it was determined there was no evidence to support the contention there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City area . Secondly , the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry has identified numerous other sources of TRS in the immediate region , none of which have been subject to the scrutiny received by IBP . Third , based on data published by local critics on TRS emissions by these sources , 99% of the time , there are no air quality violations taking place . <p> IBP announced in May 1997 plans to voluntarily build three new covered lagoons at Dakota City , which means all active lagoons at the company 's wastewater treatment plant would be covered . The company would also voluntarily install equipment designed to scrub air released from our hide tannery . . . . These and related initiatives will significantly reduce hydrogen sulfide emissions from IBP 's operations . <p> IBP 's proposed tannery expansion will increase tanned hide production by 50% , but only result in an estimated 10% increase in wastewater . . . . <p> * Wastewater . The federal government alleges IBP has violated ammonia limitations . IBP officials disagree . The company had no ammonia limits until a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were stayed by NDEQ administrative order after IBP appealed . . . . A revised permit was later drafted by NDEQ in December 1996 with no ammonia limits . <p> The government also claims treated wastewater from IBP 's treatment plant has failed toxicity limitations . What the government is not telling is that a new , more accurate testing method  --  recognized as valid by EPA and the NDEQ  --  shows IBP to be in compliance with the May 1995 toxic unit limitations in wastewater allowed to be discharged into the Missouri River . . . . <p> FOR TEXT WITHIN GRAPHICS " Something in the air " AND " Population boom " PLEASE SEE MICROFICHE
