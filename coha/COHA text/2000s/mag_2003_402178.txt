Want bright , easy foliage ? This is the plant for you . // Gardeners want lots of show for not much dough . That 's why they should plant coleus . It costs little , grows quickly , and has the gaudiest foliage imaginable . It 's equally happy in the ground or in a pot . And from the time it 's planted until a hard freeze in fall , it supplies eye-popping color . A tropical plant usually treated as an annual , coleus owes its appeal to phenomenal genetic variability . There is hardly a leaf color , shape , size , or growth habit that coleus has n't mastered . Red , orange , yellow , or pink leaves . Huge , scalloped , frilly , or tiny leaves . A plant that creeps , a plant that stands tall , coleus does it all . Tacky No More As popular as coleus is now , not long ago people considered it tacky . Hot , cheery , assertive colors were out ; cool , tranquil , shy pastels were in . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ + white + nothing else = one boring garden . According to Pam Baggett of Singing Springs Nursery in Cedar Grove , North Carolina , Southerners picked up on this quicker than others . " On a typical summer day in the South , it 's so hot and humid and sunny out that the sky 's almost gray . Under those conditions , pastels do n't look like much , " she says . " I also think we 've gotten over wanting our gardens to look soft and silver like British ones . People are injecting more personality into their gardens . " Pam is certainly doing her part . Her mail-order catalog lists 58 selections ; another 150 or so lurk in her greenhouse , waiting to be liberated . She attributes her ardor for coleus to her childhood in Carolina Beach , North Carolina , " back when it had this exquisite boardwalk and enormous carousel . It was like a carnival every night . I fell in love with color . " Photograph above : Planting coleus on each side of the porch is a surefire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Several types of sun-loving coleus form a lush , vibrant border . No flowers are needed for continuous color . // Tips for Beginners If the colors of coleus have you smitten , too , now is the time to act . Garden centers are offering more and more named selections . But for better assortments and really wild-looking plants , buy from a mail-order nursery . Although it 's tempting to plant one of each coleus you find , do n't mix them all together like toppings on a pizza . You 'll get more impact by planting a sweep of one type here and a mass of another type there . Large , shrubby selections ( up to 36 inches tall ) , such as ' Aurora ' and ' Alabama Sunset , ' work well in the back of the border . Creepers and spreaders , such as the Ducksfoot Series and ' India Frills , ' are great for edging , filling in spaces between other plants , or cascading from hanging baskets and window boxes . Native to Java ( an island of Indonesia ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moist soil , some liquid fertilizer every couple of weeks , and a good Southern summer , and it will grow faster than the national debt . Most older selections , such as those in the Wizard Series , fade and burn in full sun , but some newer types tolerate both sun and shade . They include the beautiful selections shown on these pages as well as the Florida Sun , Solar , Stained Glassworks , and Sunlover Series . Older types also sprout antenna-like flower spikes all summer , which detract from the foliage . But the new sun coleus bloom very little , keeping all eyes on the prize . How can you avoid losing your prize when a frost finally threatens in fall ? One way is to root a cutting . Though coleus root quickly in water during summer , in fall they do better in potting soil . Dip the cut ends in rooting powder , and stick them into moist soil . Provide the bright light of a windowsill , and they should make it through winter . But even if they perish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a little dough .
