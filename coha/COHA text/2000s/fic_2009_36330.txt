1 <br> <br> The rules of the New Haven Youth League required that each kid play at least ten minutes in each game . Exceptions were allowed for players who had upset their coaches by skipping practice or violating other rules . In such cases , a coach could file a report before the game and inform the scorekeeper that so-and-so would n't play much , if at all , because of some infraction . This was frowned on by the league ; it was , after all , much more recreational than competitive . <br> With four minutes left in the game , Coach Kyle looked down the bench , nodded at a somber and pouting little boy named Marquis , and said , " Do you want to play ? " Without responding , Marquis walked to the scorers ' table and waited for a whistle . His violations were numerous  --  skipping practice , skipping school , bad grades , losing his uniform , foul language . In fact , after ten weeks and fifteen games , Marquis had broken every one of the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long since realized that any new rule would be immediately violated by his star , and for that reason he trimmed his list and fought the temptation to add new regulations . It was n't working . Trying to control ten inner- city kids with a soft touch had put the Red Knights in last place in the 12 and Under division of the winter league . <br> Marquis was only eleven , but clearly the best player on the court . He preferred shooting and scoring over passing and defending , and within two minutes he 'd slashed through the lane , around and through and over much larger players , and scored six points . His average was fourteen , and if allowed to play more than half a game , he could probably score thirty . In his own young opinion , he really did n't need to practice . <br> In spite of the one-man show , the game was out of reach . Kyle McAvoy sat quietly on the bench , watching the game and waiting for the clock to wind down . One game to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a basketball coach . In two years he 'd won a dozen , lost two dozen , and asked himself how any person in his right mind would willingly coach at any level . He was doing it for the kids , he 'd said to himself a thousand times , kids with no fathers , kids from bad homes , kids in need of a positive male influence . And he still believed it , but after two years of babysitting , and arguing with parents when they bothered to show up , and hassling with other coaches who were not above cheating , and trying to ignore teenage referees who did n't know a block from a charge , he was fed up . He 'd done his community service , in this town anyway . <br> He watched the game and waited , yelling occasionally because that 's what coaches are supposed to do . He looked around the empty gym , an old brick building in downtown New Haven , home to the youth league for fifty years . A handful of parents were scattered through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marquis scored again . No one applauded . The Red Knights were down by twelve with two minutes to go . <br> At the far end of the court , just under the ancient scoreboard , a man in a dark suit walked through the door and leaned against the retractable bleachers . He was noticeable because he was white . There were no white players on either team . He stood out because he wore a suit that was either black or navy , with a white shirt and a burgundy tie , all under a trench coat that announced the presence of an agent or a cop of some variety . <br> Coach Kyle happened to see the man when he entered the gym , and he thought to himself that the guy was out of place . Probably a detective of some sort , maybe a narc looking for a dealer . It would not be the first arrest in or around the gym . <br> After the agent/cop leaned against the bleachers , he cast a long suspicious look at the Red Knights ' bench , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned the stare for a second before it became uncomfortable . Marquis let one fly from near mid- court , air ball , and Coach Kyle jumped to his feet , spread his hands wide , shook his head as if to ask , " Why ? " Marquis ignored him as he loafed back on defense . A dumb foul stopped the clock and prolonged the misery . While looking at the free-throw shooter , Kyle glanced beyond him , and in the background was the agent/cop , still staring , not at the action but at the coach . <br> For a twenty-five-year-old law student with no criminal record and no illegal habits or proclivities , the presence and the attention of a man who gave all indications of being employed by some branch of law enforcement should have caused no concern whatsoever . But it never worked that way with Kyle McAvoy . Street cops and state troopers did n't particularly bother him . They were paid to simply react . But the guys in dark suits , the investigators and agents , the ones trained to dig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> Thirty seconds to go and Marquis was arguing with a referee . He 'd thrown an F-bomb at a ref two weeks earlier and was suspended for a game . Coach Kyle yelled at his star , who never listened . He quickly scanned the gym to see if agent/cop No. 1 was alone or was now accompanied by agent/cop No. 2 . No , he was not . <br> Another dumb foul , and Kyle yelled at the referee to just let it slide . He sat down and ran his finger over the side of his neck , then flicked off the perspiration . It was early February , and the gym was , as always , quite chilly . <br> Why was he sweating ? <br> The agent/cop had n't moved an inch ; in fact he seemed to enjoy staring at Kyle . <br> The decrepit old horn finally squawked . The game was mercifully over . One team cheered , and one team really did n't care . Both lined up for the obligatory high fives and " Good game , good game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to college players . As Kyle congratulated the opposing coach , he glanced down the court . The white man was gone . <br> What were the odds he was waiting outside ? Of course it was paranoia , but paranoia had settled into Kyle 's life so long ago that he now simply acknowledged it , coped with it , and moved on . <br> The Red Knights regrouped in the visitors ' locker room , a cramped little space under the sagging and permanent stands on the home side . There Coach Kyle said all the right things  --  nice effort , good hustle , our game is improving in certain areas , let 's finish on a high note this Saturday . The boys were changing clothes and hardly listening . They were tired of basketball because they were tired of losing , and of course all blame was heaped upon the coach . He was too young , too white , too much of an Ivy Leaguer . <br> The few parents who were there waited outside the locker room , and it was those tense moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his community service . There would be the usual complaints about playing time . Marquis had an uncle , a twenty-two year-old former all-state player with a big mouth and a fondness for bitching about Coach Kyle 's unfair treatment of the " best player in the league . " <br> From the locker room , there was another door that led to a dark narrow hallway that ran behind the home stands and finally gave way to an outside door that opened into an alley . Kyle was not the first coach to discover this escape route , and on this night he wanted to avoid not only the families and their complaints but also the agent/ cop . He said a quick goodbye to his boys , and as they fled the locker room , he made his escape . In a matter of seconds he was outside , in the alley , then walking quickly along a frozen sidewalk . Heavy snow had been plowed , and the sidewalk was icy and barely passable . The temperature was somewhere far below freezing . It was 8:30 on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices at the Yale Law School , where he would work until midnight at least . <br> He did n't make it . <br> The agent was leaning against the fender of a red Jeep Cherokee that was parked parallel on the street . The vehicle was titled to one John McAvoy of York , Pennsylvania , but for the past six years it had been the reliable companion of his son , Kyle , the true owner . <br> Though his feet suddenly felt like bricks and his knees were weak , Kyle managed to trudge on as if nothing were wrong . Not only did they find me , he said to himself as he tried to think clearly , but they 've done their homework and found my Jeep . Not exactly high-level research . I have done nothing wrong , he said again and again . <br> " Tough game , Coach , " the agent said when Kyle was ten feet away and slowing down . <br> Kyle stopped and took in the thick young man with red cheeks and red bangs who 'd been watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he said , and immediately saw the shadow of No. 2 dart across the street . They always worked in pairs . <br> No. 1 reached into a pocket , and as he said " That 's exactly what you can do , " he pulled out a leather wallet and flipped it open . " Bob Plant , FBI . " <br> " A real pleasure , " Kyle said as all the blood left his brain and he could n't help but flinch . <br> No. 2 wedged himself into the frame . He was much thinner and ten years older with gray around the temples . He , too , had a pocketful , and he performed the well- rehearsed badge presentation with ease . " Nelson Ginyard , FBI , " he said . <br> Bob and Nelson . Both Irish . Both northeastern . <br> " Anybody else ? " Kyle asked . <br> " No . Got a minute to talk ? " <br> " Not really . " <br> " You might want to , " Ginyard said . " It could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <br> " If you leave , we 'll just follow , " Plant said as he stood from his slouch position and took a step closer . " You do n't want us on campus , do you ? " <br> " Are you threatening me ? " Kyle asked . The sweat was back , now in the pits of his arms , and despite the arctic air a bead or two ran down his ribs . <br> " Not yet , " Plant said with a smirk . <br> " Look , let 's spend ten minutes together , over coffee , " Ginyard was saying . " There 's a sandwich shop just around the corner . I 'm sure it 's warmer there . " <br> " Do I need a lawyer ? " <br> " No . " <br> " That 's what you always say . My father is a lawyer and I grew up in his office . I know your tricks . " <br> " No tricks , Kyle , I swear , " Ginyard said , and he at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I promise you wo n't regret it . " <br> " What 's on the agenda ? " <br> " Ten minutes . That 's all we ask . " <br> " Give me a clue or the answer is no . " <br> Bob and Nelson looked at each other . Both shrugged . Why not ? We 'll have to tell him sooner or later . Ginyard turned and looked down the street and spoke into the wind . " Duquesne University . Five years ago . Drunk frat boys and a girl . " <br> Kyle 's body and mind had different reactions . His body conceded  --  a quick slump of the shoulders , a slight gasp , a noticeable jerk in the legs . But his mind fought back instantly . " That 's bullshit ! " he said , then spat on the sidewalk . " I 've already been through this . Nothing happened and you know it . " <br> There was a long pause as Ginyard continued to stare down the street while Plant watched their subject 's every move . Kyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an alleged state crime ? In second-year Criminal Procedure they had studied the new laws regarding FBI interrogation . It was now an indictable offense to simply lie to an agent in this very situation . Should he shut up ? Should he call his father ? No , under no circumstances would he call his father . <br> Ginyard turned , took three steps closer , clenched his jaw like a bad actor , and tried to hiss his tough- guy words . " Let 's cut to the chase , Mr. McAvoy , because I 'm freezing . There 's an indictment out of Pittsburgh , okay . Rape . If you want to play the hard-ass smart-ass brilliant law student and run get a lawyer , or even call your old man , then the indictment comes down tomorrow and the life you have planned is pretty much shot to shit . However , if you give us ten minutes of your valuable time , right now , in the sandwich shop around the corner , then the indictment will be put on hold , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it , " Plant said from the side . " Without a word . " <br> " Why should I trust you ? " Kyle managed to say with a very dry mouth . <br> " Ten minutes . " <br> " You got a tape recorder ? " <br> " Sure . " <br> " I want it on the table , okay ? I want every word recorded because I do n't trust you . " <br> " Fair enough . " <br> They jammed their hands deep into the pockets of their matching trench coats and stomped away . Kyle unlocked his Jeep and got inside . He started the engine , turned the heat on high , and thought about driving away . <br> Excerpted from THE ASSOCIATE by John Grisham <br> Published by Doubleday <br> Reprinted with permission of the publisher . <br> Copyright 2009 by Belfry Holdings , Inc . <br> Continues ...
