Chapter One I still remember my first glimpse of Mr. Inconnu . It 's easy to remember , because it was also my last one . It was while I was in training . I was hastening between Quonset huts , to the mess hall . It was raining . It 's always raining in the Alaska panhandle , except in the winter when it 's snowing . And this was spring , shortly after the Good Friday earthquake of 1964 . We had n't gotten the direct impact , for the epicenter was five hundred miles to the northwest , at the northern end of Prince William Sound . But the tsunamis had swept to the far reaches of the Pacific , with twenty-foot waves as far as California . We had been mostly shielded by Chichagoff and Admiralty Islands , but we 'd gotten some messy aftereffects . And now the rain was worse than usual . So I was n't able to get a really good view of the group of men emerging from the HQ Quonset , including the elderly guy-or at least he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sure . His hair , which I could see before he pulled the hood of his parka up over it , was gray , shading to white at the temples . His left side was turned to me , and even in these conditions I could see he had one hell of a facial scar . Then he turned toward me , and for a very small fraction of a second our eyes met . Then he wasgone . That was all there was to it . I 'm certain I would n't have noticed him at all , except that something about him seemed oddly familiar . Afterwards , I described him to my roommate Dan Buckley , who 'd been at the facility longer than I had and fancied himself the ultimate repository of insider knowledge . Even while condescending to enlighten my ignorance , he could n't entirely conceal his surprise at the glimpse I 'd gotten . " Hardly anybody ever sees him , " Dan explained . " The only people he has direct contact with are the higher-ups . I guess he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had somehow lost ground by revealing that he was impressed , Dan leaned close and spoke in his wisdom-imparting voice . " They say he 's got direct , automatic access to the President . " " I suppose he 'd have to , considering ... " As I replied absently , most of my mind was contemplating the fact that I 'd seen the man who was the ultimate reason all of us were there , up the Lynn Canal Inlet from Juneau , not quite halfway to Skagway . And now that I knew who he was , I remembered the one slide , made from a poor-quality photo , that I 'd seen of him . Of course , he looked older now , as was only to be expected . But the scar was still a dead giveaway . But I 'm getting ahead of my story . All this was , of course , after I 'd been recruited for the Prometheus Project . I remember the day that began , too . In fact , I 'd remember that day even if I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my generation can ever forget . * * * Those of the younger generations ( God , have I actually lived long enough to hear myself using a phrase like that ? ) find it very difficult to believe that not so very long ago Washington , DC , was like some sleepy , comfortably down-at- heels southern state capital . It 's true , though . At least as recently as the early 1960s you could just drive your car into the Capitol parking lot , and if you could find a space that was neither reserved nor already taken-which was often possible-you could simply park and walk into the Capitol building . No metal detectors . No Delta Force wannabes waiting to swoop down on you . And as for the White House , you just strolled along the street-it was a street then-to the East Wing and got in line . I swear it 's true . And it was n't just the big-deal government buildings . Washington had at least its share of large hotels , of course , but even those had character . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars that had aged well , their walls covered to practically the last square inch with framed , faded , autographed photos of politicians who 'd gotten soused there . Those places had even more character . So did the sidewalk cafes that lent a delightful suggestion of Paris or Rome in the days before the freaks took over the sidewalks . The whole city oozed character . It was a great town . Really . May I be sentenced to live in today 's DC if I lie . I was there in November of 1963 . It was a little over a year after I 'd parted company with the Army . ( No , I do n't want to talk about it . ) My new career had taken me out of town , and I liked this particular job because it brought me back to Washington , where I was based . I loved Washington-especially in the autumn . Forget those famous cherry blossoms in the spring . Autumn was best . Not that I had all that much time to appreciate it . I was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Georgetown-an area recently made fashionable by the Kennedy administration types , but still recognizable . The bar was a little place on one of the side streets off M Street , not far from the footbridge across the canal . I was to meet George Stafford there . As I approached the place , I became aware that something was not quite right . People were hurrying into the bar in abnormal numbers for early afternoon-people who did n't look like regulars . I immediately realized I should n't go in . Even if the meeting had n't been blown , any out-of-the ordinary event at the venue meant it would be , or at least should be . Either way , it was time for me to take a leisurely stroll along the Potomac riverfront . But a zillion generations of monkey ancestors told me to follow the crowd , out of sheer curiosity to see what all the fuss was about . Inside , the sense of wrongness grew . People were clustered at the bar-but they were n't drinking , to speak of . And they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the rows of bottles . The voices from the TV had the unmistakable tone of news announcers trying to fill a silence . I shouldered my way through the oddly passive crowd . I got to the bar just in time to see the latest of the cruelly interminable reruns of the motorcade in Dallas , focusing on one open-topped car and on the famous chestnut-haired head which suddenly slammed forward with the impact of a bullet . You have to understand . We did n't know any of the stuff that came out about him later . Like the fact that he was the kind of guy who , at the time his wife was undergoing a difficult and possibly life-threatening childbirth , was off cruising the Med with a boatload of bimbos . The kind of guy who cheerfully signed his name to a book Daddy had had ghost-written , and afterwards cheerfully accepted the Pulitzer prize Daddy bought for the book . In fact , he hardly ever did anything in his life for any reason except to please Daddy . And Daddy was , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal in American history ... besides being a Nazi sympathizer , unlike most crooks , who at least are refreshingly apolitical . A good match for Mommy , whose religious bigotry would have been considered a bit much in the sixteenth century . No , we did n't know any of that at the time . All we knew was that he was young and vivid and stood out like a flame among the bald , boring old farts who in our experience-I was twenty-seven then-made up the political establishment . Call us nave if you want . I ca n't stop you . I ca n't even disagree with you . All I can say is that he meant something to us , as though something new had come into our world with him . And now that something had been snuffed out . That was why , for decades afterwards , in the teeth of all the evidence , people went on believing in various conspiracy theories , the more far-fetched the better . We could n't accept the fact-and it is a fact-that the assassination had been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loser . That truth was unacceptable because it somehow diminished us . Surely the obliteration of what had meant so much to us-defined us , in a way-had to mean something , because we meant something . Did n't we ? In my case , it did n't help that I 'd been in the Army 's Special Forces before ... never mind . He had always been kind of a special patron of ours . He 'd reviewed us once , and passed within a few feet of me . Anyway , I do n't remember much of the rest of that day , or the next few . At some point , though , I ended up at Matt Kane 's , not far from the Fourteenth Street sleaze strip , late at night . That place was another great thing about the old Washington . If you walked in through the storefront-like entrance , it was just a medium-seedy Irish neighborhood tavern . You had to know the side door , off to the right , that led through a slightly alarming-looking corridor to the " Bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole thing having been brought over from the Auld Sod brick by brick was probably bullshit . But it was full of banners and Gaelic road signs and all the rest , and it hosted the best Irish bands to cross the Atlantic . Tonight , though , the usual liveliness was gone . And I was ignoring the justly famous beer list . I had ordered another Irish on the rocks when I became aware that the barstool beside me had acquired an occupant . " Better go easy on that stuff , Bob , " said George Stafford . " You missed the meeting in Georgetown , " I stated . Even on that day , I 'd retained enough presence of mind to check out the crowd . He had n't been there . " I know . I was unavoidably detained . There was a lot going on that day . " " Golly , George , thanks for telling me that . What would I do without you ? I never would have known if you had n't ? " " Cut the goddamned sarcasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looked like he had n't slept in days . " It just happens that the present situation is especially difficult for the people I work for . " " About whose identity I 've never been entirely clear . " I was pleased with myself for being able to navigate through that sentence . In fact , the accomplishment seemed to call for a drink . I suited the action to the thought . " You do n't need to be ' clear ' on it . All you need to know is that I represent people who sometimes need certain services on an ad hoc basis , with no questions asked . The very fact that you 've never shown an interest in their identity is one of the main reasons you 've gotten their business . " " Point taken . Okay , what do you-sorry , I mean the people you represent-need this time ? " Actually , I had a pretty good idea , if only in general terms . Stafford was something in the government , I knew that much . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't the FBI or the CIA or anything like that . Those would n't have had any need for the services of a freelancer like myself-they had their own people . No , his agency just had occasional , obviously somewhat irregular contacts with some superspooky outfit or other ... and it did n't want to use its own people to make those contacts . Instead , it used **26;684;TOOLONG contractors like yours truly , who had no idea who they were ultimately working for , and could be disavowed and forgotten like a bad smell if such became necessary or convenient . ( The English language had n't yet become debased enough for a term like " plausible deniability , " but that was the idea . ) Which was fine with me . The money was good , and since I was expendable , they had no reason to be concerned about my background . A marriage made in heaven , you might say . " The matter concerning which we were supposed to meet in Georgetown has been canceled indefinitely . But now there 's something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arisen over the last few days . " I patiently endured Stafford 's circumlocution , knowing his inability to communicate without it . " There 's somebody coming to Washington . Several people , actually . But you only need to worry about one of them . She 'll be arriving at National Airport tomorrow . " He passed me a typed itinerary . " You 're to meet her and bring her to the address in here . " He slid a sealed envelope along the bar . " Do n't open it until you 've actually picked her up . " My eyebrows rose . This exceeded even Stafford 's usual capacity for cloak-and- dagger theatricality . But I was perfectly willing to play his games as long as I was paid to do so . " How will I know her ? " For answer , Stafford handed me a wallet-sized photo . It showed a handsome brunette , not too much older than me but too severe-looking for my taste . " You will address her as ' Miss Smith ' , " Stafford went on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . " " While keeping a straight face ? " I inquired , straight-faced . Stafford looked pained , and I raised a hand to forestall him . " I know , I know : ' no questions asked . ' I will ask one question , though . Are you expecting trouble ? " " There should n't be any . " Stafford 's tone seemed oddly at variance with his words . It was n't an assurance , but a kind of desperate , almost truculent assertion , as though things were happening that had no business happening . " However , it seems that the possibility ca n't be entirely discounted . Why do you think we 're hiring you ? " " Skip the flattery . I expect a hazardous-duty bonus . " Stafford flushed . " Why ? This is simply what we pay you for in the first place . " " Nope . You pay me-and , I imagine , others like me-because you want to keep your hands clean . Fine . But I get the impression that this is n't exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ass , I expect to be compensated accordingly . " " Do n't push it , " Stafford snarled . " Remember , if it was n't for us , you would n't be in business at all . " There was an element of truth to this . I 'd put out the word through various acquaintances that I could provide certain services discreetly . The result had been my first contact with Stafford . Shortly after that , my license to operate a private security service had come through , despite the **25;712;TOOLONG discharge from the Army that I had on my record . I could n't pretend that the two had been unconnected . Still , I did n't appreciate him reminding me of it . So I turned my attention back to my drink , ignoring him and waiting patiently while he jittered . " All right , " he finally blurted . " I ca n't make a firm commitment . But we 'll talk about it after she 's safely delivered . " " Fair enough , " I allowed , deciding it would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his present emotional state . Shortly thereafter , I departed , seeking my car . Even the hookers on Fourteenth Street seemed subdued . Everybody was subdued these days-except Stafford , who acted like he was fending off a nervous breakdown . My apartment-cum-office was east of Rock Creek Park , which was why I could afford it . It was n't bad , though . I had half of the second story of an **31;739;TOOLONG four-story building just off Dupont Circle . My three front windows were up where most passersby never look , above the storefront first floor . The doorway in the entry hall at the stairway landing , with its understated plaque reading Robert Devaney , Security Services , led directly into the office part : very basic , for I had no receptionist , nor any need of one . I 'd found it was cheaper to hire an answering service-this was decades before voice mail , remember-and return any calls that seemed promising . Stafford and a few others knew the code-phrases to drop . So the office was really a place to do whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I suppose it had been somebody 's parlor , once upon a time . Behind the desk was a door leading to the living area , consisting of three rooms with the usual functions . In addition , there was what had clearly been a workshop . I 'd hired a carpenter to conceal one wall of it behind a kind of shallow cabinet . The wall itself held hooks and racks to support tools . Now they held my tools-two of which I selected the following morning . Even then , the Colt 1911 A1 was considered old-fashioned almost to the point of obsolescence . I still liked it , for its reliability and for the sheer stopping power of its .45 ACP slug . It went into an armpit holster-it was just barely small enough to carry that way , even under a loose-fitting jacket . Another holster fit around my right ankle . It held a Beretta .25 , a gun on which I wasted very little respect . In fact , I regarded it as just the thing for a firefight in a phone booth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sins in a last-ditch holdout weapon . ( Continues ... )
