<p> David Duval sat calmly in front of his locker , talking about his struggles as if the discussion were almost cathartic . <p> Once one of the world 's best players , Duval has become one of golf 's biggest mysteries , mired in a slump that has been severe and shocking . Heading into the P.G.A . Championship , which begins Thursday at Oak Hill Country Club , Duval has made only four cuts in 18 events this year . He has missed the cut in all three majors . And his best finish is a tie for 28th . <p> To appreciate how stunning that is , one has to appreciate Duval 's talent . In 1999 he briefly supplanted Tiger Woods as the world 's No. 1-ranked player , winning four times before mid-April . From 1997 to 2001 , Duval won 13 tournaments , capped by his victory at the 2001 British Open , the crowning moment of his career and his first major championship . <p> " It 's funny when you hear these idiots expounding on why my game is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If my game is so bad , then why was I No. 1 in the world ? If your swing is n't sound , you 're not going to have success for eight years at this level . " <p> But the 2001 British Open was Duval 's last victory , and the two-year drought has forced him to take a harder look at his game and his life . He remains one of golf 's most introspective and straightforward personalities , and while his difficulties have tested him , they have not defeated him . At age 31 , he believes strongly that his game will come back . He is working with a new coach , Jack Lumpkin , and a new psychologist , Gio Valiante , searching for his old game with a new perspective . But he is not expecting the road back to be easy . <p> " Unfortunately , I measure success right now differently than I used to , " Duval said . " Do I have a chance to win this week ? Yeah , I have a chance . Do I expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be having four days where I feel good , where I feel comfortable , where I do n't wander mentally . <p> " Up until the last 12 months , I 've had a terrific career . I 'm in a bad cycle right now , and unfortunately for me , it 's lasted a little longer than I expected . " <p> What happened to Duval ? There is no simple answer , or simple solution , to his problems . But injuries and lost confidence have been major factors . Since hurting his back in 2000 , Duval has changed his posture over the ball , leading to other inconsistencies in his swing . His back flared up again last week at the International , forcing him to make a trip last weekend to see a specialist . Though Duval is not always in pain , compensating for his back has led to habits in his swing that have been hard to break . <p> Once one of the game 's most consistent drivers , Duval will now sometimes hit shots without warning that sail wildly into trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole that ruins his round . He started becoming far less consistent in 2001 , and even after winning the British Open he sensed his game beginning to slide . <p> " It was n't like I hit the ball great that week , but I made every putt , " Duval said . <p> The worse Duval played , the more he worked on his game , which engrained some bad habits even deeper . Though golf is hardly Duval 's only interest , he resents the notion that he no longer works as hard on his game . He is a bachelor who loves to snowboard and fish , and he is as likely to talk about a book he is reading as he is to talk about golf . Yet , he has missed being in the hunt on Sunday , and he insisted it had not been for lack of trying . <p> " People have started to question my desire , wondering why I 'm not angry , " Duval said . " What do I have to be angry about ? About one million men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masters like I did this year . My saying that is n't losing my desire . It 's just taking a step back and realizing that I 'm still very fortunate . <p> " After I shot 83 at Augusta and missed the cut , nobody from the media watches me hit balls for two hours on the range . People make these statements about me , but they 're not based on fact . I have n't lost my desire . " <p> But as he continued to struggle , the golf course was no longer a place of solace for Duval , a private person who had always felt most comfortable inside the ropes . Imagine coming to the golf course , knowing you will probably play poorly and knowing that thousands will be watching . For a professional golfer , that is a lonely place to be , but Duval has been there , like at the Greater Hartford Open last month , when he shot an opening-round 83 , then withdrew . <p> To Duval 's credit , his stoic , professional on-course demeanor has not changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite his frustration . <p> " It 's easy to act professional when you 're beating everybody , " Duval said . " It 's harder to act professional when you 're playing like a slouch , like I 've been . I think that shows more about your character . And the support I 've gotten from fans out there has been really gratifying . " <p> Duval also has close friends on the Tour , but he is not naive enough to believe that everyone in the locker room is rooting for him , especially those he was never close to , or those who may have envied his success . Asked what percentage of his peers wanted him to become a top player again , Duval put his head down and laughed . <p> " I 'm sure there are some people who are a little happy about how I 'm playing it , " Duval said , smiling . " That 's O.K. You certainly find out who your friends are . " <p> One of those friends is Davis Love III , who has four victories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " There 's two amazing things about David , " said Love , who played a practice round with Duval today . " No. 1 , he has played poorly for this long . And No. 2 , what a great attitude he has . He 's still the same guy . He still has fun . When he hits it by me , he 's still cocky . " <p> Love suggested that Duval seek two people for help  --  Lumpkin , Love 's longtime swing coach , and Valiante , a psychology professor from Rollins College in Florida , who has also worked with Love . Valiante has worked with Duval for several months , while Lumpkin and Duval began working together this week . <p> " We 're trying to get him back to swinging like he used to swing , " Lumpkin said . " David has always had a little bit of an unusual swing , but it was good enough for him to be No. 1 in the world , or No. 2 in the world , for a long time . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to say too much until we 're farther along . " <p> David Leadbetter , the well-regarded swing coach who worked with Duval before Lumpkin , does not believe that Duval has to make major swing changes to be successful again . <p> " David has very much what I 'd call a homegrown swing , but you look at players from the past , like Lee Trevino , who 've been very successful with that kind of swing , " Leadbetter said . " Sometimes , only the player himself knows the intricacies of his swing . It 's not a swing you would teach , with a strong grip , closed club face , the head coming up . It 's almost the antithesis of what golf instruction is about . But he 'll get it back . It 's a confidence thing . " <p> Valiante has been concentrating on the mental side , talking to Duval about his thinking on and off the course . <p> " I felt like more than anything , I needed to hear a new voice , " Duval said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Duval still laughs a lot , he still lives a fortunate life on his terms and he still finds enjoyment away from golf . But he looks forward to arriving at a major once again as one of the favorites , instead of being ranked No. 137 in the world . <p> " No matter how long you play , no matter how much you practice , this is a game you 'll never master , " Duval said . " I 'm working hard to get back to where I want to be , addressing everything that needs to be addressed . Really , that 's all I can do . " <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
