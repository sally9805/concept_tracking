<p> Ah , the sounds of spring ! Birds chirping , peepers peeping , a breeze rustling in the trees - as lawn mowers rumble , cellphones ring , and car stereos throb their way through neighborhoods . <p> Warm weather brings all kinds of sounds to life . But hearing the natural world in springtime is getting harder than ever no matter where you live , according to Les Blomberg , executive director of the Noise Pollution Clearinghouse , based in Montpelier , Vt . <p> " Without question our society is much noisier than it used to be , " he says . " People used to move to the suburbs to get away from it , but now they have to listen leaf blowers , riding mowers , eight-lane highways . We 've brought our noise with us from the city . " <p> Noise pollution , which has been a back-burner issue for decades , is causing new stirrings of revolt . Along with legislation at the federal level , antinoise campaigns are under way at the state and local level as residents rally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soundscape . <p> " Right now we 're at the infancy of the antinoise movement - where air and water pollution were in the 1960s , " says Ted Rueter , a Tulane University political scientist who three years ago created a " Noise Free America " website . <p> Noise pollution activists like Dr. Rueter say they get a lot of e-mail berating them for bothering about noise when there are more serious issues out there . But an even larger and growing number of responses come from those who are fed up with the din . <p> " We 're still at the point where people need to know that others feel the same way , " Rueter says . " It 's like secondhand smoke used to be . People were once afraid to speak up for fear of being called a nut or kook . " <p> Transportation - from planes , trains and cars - was the nation 's major source of noise for the first half of the 20th century . At least since World War II , though , other noisemakers have steadily intruded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wilderness . Now more recent inventions are proliferating and adding to the mix , Mr. Blomberg says . <p> Car alarms , jet skis , cellphones , snowmobiles , chain saws , and riding lawn mowers have pumped up the volume in every walk of life . Now , there 's " the Beast , " a cherry red Ford Bronco with a 48,000-watt stereo system . <p> " Boom cars , " along with their kin " vroom cars " with modified mufflers , came of age in the 1990s . But the Beast is a boomer with few peers . With shatterproof glass and a huge power supply , it can pump out 175 decibels - eight times the sound of a Boeing 747 . <p> Alma Gates , the silver-haired grandmother who created and owns the Beast , lets it out to play only to blow competitors away at " sound drag racing " competitions . Yet the boom-car phenomenon , urged on by car-stereo manufacturers , has produced thousands of Beast-wannabes cruising America 's streets . ( " Shake the living , wake the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sony offers : " All new ways to offend . " ) <p> And that 's a problem for Carla Moore , from Youngstown , Ohio . For years she put up with boomers , until the subsonic vibrations began shaking things on her mantel . Finally she decided to fight it with citizen action . <p> In February 2002 , Youngstown was designated one of the " noisy dozen , " by Noise Free America . ( Jesse Ventura recently won the award for touting his new Hummer and its powerful stereo system . ) <p> After news articles about the designation appeared , Ms. Moore began appealing to the city to strengthen its noise ordinance . It did . Now Youngstown police find it easier to cite boomers and the noise level has improved - though not enough to suit Moore . <p> " We used to have hummingbirds and rabbits come to our yard , " she says . " But since the booming started you do n't really hear birds anymore in the warm months . I used to sit and listen to the wind in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now all we can hear are these cars running up and down the street . You ca n't hear anything else . " <p> Street noise is the No. 1 problem Americans cite when asked what bothers them most in their neighborhoods . In a 2001 US Census survey , 11.8 million households ( out of 106 million reporting ) said street or traffic noise was bothersome . An additional 4.5 million residents said it was so bad they wanted to move . <p> Standing on a Boston street corner , Blomberg gazes at a tripod-mounted decibel meter - taking sound-level readings that show the traffic at about 70 decibels . A horn blast and accelerating diesel truck engine send the meter soaring to 80 decibels . That 's really loud because every 10 decibel increase effectively doubles the noise . <p> Blomberg , who hold a master 's degree in philosophy , says the increasing noise is becoming an environmental-justice issue because poor communities often suffer from loud noise at night . <p> Even so , noise pollution has taken a back seat for decades . The Environmental Protection Agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Reagan , funding was cut and it was closed in 1981 . <p> Back to Congress <p> Now , antinoise activists are on the political warpath again . In Congress , at least 10 bills aim to regulate noise - mostly aircraft flights over wilderness , park lands , and residential areas . Rep. Nita Lowey ( D ) of New York has proposed - repeatedly - a Quiet Communities Act that would reinstate EPA 's noise abatement office . <p> But most of the action lies at the state and local level . Scores of cities - from Chicago to Los Angeles - are tightening noise ordinances . In California alone , at least 17 cities - including Sacramento and San Diego - have clamped down on leaf blowers . Vancouver and Toronto are considering similar regulations . Indeed , leaf blowers seem to have become the poster child for noisiness . Robin Pendergrast , a power-equipment company lobbyist , warned the industry in a 2000 analysis that more than 450 communities in 20 states , Canada , and parts of Europe , had tried to restrict or ban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where car alarms and the thumping basses of the club scene cause the most complaints , noisiness is under attack . And city officials are listening . A two-year-old push to bring peace and quiet to New York neighborhoods is called " Operation Silent Night . " Armed with sound meters , New York 's finest are citing businesses that violate noise ordinances . <p> One grass-roots group called " the Silent Majority " is pushing hard to ban the bane of sleep-deprived New Yorkers - the car alarm . A recent study by Silent Majority , entitled " Alarmingly Useless , " calculated the monetary cost at more than $ 400 million in lost productivity , health costs , property values , and diminished quality of life . <p> " In my neighborhood people have punctured tires of cars when the alarm wo n't shut off , " says Aaron Friedman , who heads " The Silent Majority . " " A friend of mine says he 's even seen cars set on fire and burned when the alarm wo n't shut off . " <p> Noisy and needless ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarms is a widely shared sense that they are ineffective . Insurance studies show little or no difference in theft rates between cars with alarms and those without , Mr. Friedman says . " It 's quite shocking how frustrated people get , " he says . " But then again , these alarms are designed to irritate people at 120 decibels . It 's like living in a war zone when you 're trying to sleep . " <p> Some see the problem as part of a larger issue of " the commons , " others as a health issue . The World Health Organization has issued guidelines and the European Union has taken steps to monitor sound across its member nations . But the bottom line is that since noise always trumps quiet , people have to care about the quiet in order to preserve it - which means they have to care about their neighbors . <p> When moving does n't work <p> The traditional solution for the noise-annoyed has been to insulate one 's home or move . But with boom cars on the loose , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer a guarantee . " You might move and have a new noise problem pop up , " Blomberg says . " What we 're seeing now is the growth now of community-oriented solutions . " <p> One of those solutions could be technological . Speaker technology is so sophisticated it could be used on fire trucks to target only the street ahead and side streets - not the air above or behind the truck . <p> High-tech rescue <p> " People assume that because we live in a technological society the one price we must pay is noise , " Blomberg says . " But the same technology can be used to quiet the noise - that 's a message that has not reached people . " <p> As the noise level rises , so will lawsuits against manufacturers of noisy products , and more antinoise legislation is already coming , Rueter predicts . Besides ongoing litigation against airport noise , the running legal battle over snowmobile noise in Yellowstone National Park and similar sites is just the first round of national noise-related litigation , he says . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep a lid on the sound and fury of lawyers in courtrooms . His website admonishes that " good neighbors keep their noise to themselves . " <p> Then again , there 's always Lorain , Ohio 's solution : the sledgehammer . After residents there petitioned to stop the booming , the city adopted an ordinance permitting confiscation of the offending car stereo system after a second offense . <p> Pete Rewak is the municipal court officer in Lorain who carries out the death sentence of municipal judges on offending car stereos . It 's not a job he relishes . But ever since his picture appeared in the paper swinging his big hammer , he 's had people telling him they 'd like to help out . " Yep , some people do say that , " he says . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
