Section : On Political Books While American life is getting better , we are n't getting happier . TABLE <p> Gregg Easterbrook is frustrated . He is certain that life is getting better for Americans and many others . He knows that we are living better than our grandparents did , and better than our great-grandparents imagined . ( He 's right . ) He believes , and sought to demonstrate in his 1995 book , A Moment on Earth , that environmentalists have succeeded and that the world is getting cleaner , though they wo n't admit it . ( The green crowd was n't swayed . ) <p> But people are n't convinced . Why are n't we happier , he wonders ? Why , even before September 11 , did so many Americans tell pollsters that the country was going downhill ? Why is depression an increasingly common affliction ? What are we so stressed out about ? In his sixth book , Easterbrook sets out to answer a question posed by sociologist Alan Wolfe : " Why do capitalism and liberal democracy , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest happiness for the greatest number , leave so much dissatisfaction in their wake ? ' : <p> It is a very good question . Easterbrook  --  who writes for The New Republic , The Atlantic Monthly , ESPN.com. , and this magazine , among others wanders through Western philosophy and psychology ( having written an earlier book on faith ) seeking an answer . Ultimately , he does n't find a satisfying one . <p> The case that we are living a lot better than our recent ancestors in terms of health , longevity , and the goods and services we consume is a strong ' one . Easterbrook makes the case with anecdotes and what journalists call " factoids , " those irresistible nuggets that lodge in the reader 's mind and pop out at dinner table discussions . Hem 's one : " The typical American place of dwelling , " he writes , " has 5.3 rooms for its average of 2.6 people . This means that a long-standing metric of comfortable living , ' a room of their own , ' has been done one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own ... Today the typical circumstance for an American , even a typical child or teenager , is to have his or her own bedroom surely the first time in history this has been achieved for an entire large society . " ( My recent tour of college campuses with my 17-year-old daughter , however , suggests that Easterbrook gets carried away when he suggests that the typical college student has a single and that the " austere small dorm room of the past , two twin beds and two desks wedged in together " is disappearing . ) He does n't , though he might , dwell very much on the ways in which the Internet has changed our lives for the better . But hem 's a factoid I uncovered while preparing this review : His book lists for $2495 , but at the end of September you could have ordered it for $17.47 on Amazon.com . <p> Although Easterbrook asserts that he is trying to show that " average people " are " better off , " he inexplicably opens his first chapter by describing restaurants that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguing that these are n't the private jets of the super-rich , but one- and two-engine planes of farmers , oil field workers , and others in the middle Class . " Thousands of private aircraft are owned for personal use by people who are not rich , " he asserts . I 'm sure that 's true , but it 's not a very good way to convince skeptical readers that " average people " are better off . The middle 60 percent of American households , the Census Bureau says , had an annual income between $18,000 and $84,000 in 2002 . I doubt a significant fraction of those folks own private aircraft . <p> My favorite factoid in this paradox , though one that might better serve a book attacking the decadence of US. society , is this : " For $75,000 Jackson &; Perkins of Somis , Calif. ... will give a new rose variety the name of your choosing , fly you and a companion to Los Angeles for a week that includes a fine dinner with the company 's plant-breeders and , once the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country to anyone you select , so that friends and family will smell the rose that bears your name " He says more than 100 rose lovers have spent a total of over $7.5 million on this . <p> The cover of this book shows a glass of water that is , depending on your perspective , half-full or half-empty . Easterbrook 's goal , in part , is to convince readers that it 's half-full , and he provides a lot of evidence . But my sense is that convincing people takes more than facts and one-liners gleaned from the Statistical Abstract of the United States . Skeptical readers are more convinced when these facts and figures are accompanied by portraits of real people , perhaps a comparison of a modem middle-class family 's life to that of its parents . This is hard to do well . Talking to ordinary people might shed light on the central question of this book : Why are n't we happier ? Easterbrook has chosen instead to look for answers in the library . <p> He offers several intriguing hypotheses . Among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This wonderful phrase describes something obvious once you think about it : The solution to one problem seems to bequeath another . We invent a polio vaccine , then fear the vaccine may cause other ailments . We make wireless communications possible and cheap , then find ourselves unable to escape the office or fearful that the SUV driver behind us is devoting more attention to his cell phone than the road . We find new miraculous cures for disease , then wonder if we can afford them . So much for the end of history . <p> BAD NEWS SELLS . Bad news helps political groups on the left and right raise money . It helps political challengers attack incumbents . It preoccupies the intellectual elites who have ready access to the printing press . It sells newspapers and draws viewers to local TV news stories . Here 's another of Easterbrook 's nuggets that sticks with you long after you 've put the book down : The local NBC affiliate in Washington , DC , changed the name of its weather segment from Weather-Center to StormCenter during a snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  even for sunny days . <p> LACK or SLEEP . Americans sleep an hour less a night than they did a generation ago , he says , and two or three hours a night less than a century ago . <p> HUMAN NATURE . Perhaps we have an evolutionary predisposition to the negative which helped our ancestors survive . " We are built to be effective animals , not happy ones , " evolutionary psychologist Robert Wright has written . Or perhaps the problem is that most Americans and Europeans are descended from people who were n't prosperous , people who were right to believe that the rich get everything and the rest of us get nothing . He calls this " abundance denial ? ' Once it was true ; it is no longer . <p> ENVY . We constantly compare ourselves to others , particularly to others who have more . I think there 's a lot to this explanation : One big change in the past quarter century , it seems to me , is how much ordinary Americans know or think they know about how well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine , and other media . And these media are n't concentrating on royalty or business aristocracy , but on the large number of folks with houses and cars that the bulk of us will never be able to afford . <p> Easterbrook dwells briefly , perhaps too briefly , on the nature and effects of economic inequality in the United States today . He has been convinced by Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless that the slowdown in the growth of incomes of the middle of the middle class which began in the mid-1970s and lasted through the mid-1990s , is explained away by immigration . Native born Americans did great . The national numbers were distorted by the influx of immigrants who did n't earn much by American standards , but did much better than they would have in their home countries , he argues , so there 's nothing to worry about or discuss . The economic impact of immigrants is worth some thought , and Mr. Burtless 's provocative point is worth examination , but it 's too facile an explanation for what happened in the 1970s and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1973 meant that living standards of the American middle class did n't improve as much in a generation as they had , for instance , in the quarter century after World War II . That was n't all about immigration . The widening gap between the wages of those with an education and those without made for greater inequality . So did a change in social norms in all sorts of American institutions . They now tolerate and even encourage much greater rewards for the best producers ( " pay for performance " ) than had previously been the case not only in law firms , investment banks , and baseball teams , but also in big companies who rely on temps or outside contractors whom they pay less and offer fewer benefits . <p> As if to shield himself from critics who accuse him of overlooking the poorest among us , Easterbrook includes a chapter with four prescriptions : provide universal health care , raise the minimum wage even if it means higher prices , pay CEOs less , and , spend more on foreign aid to poor countries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write more on how to accomplish each of these goals without unwelcome side effects . How , for instance , do we raise the minimum wage without pushing even more low-skilled jobs off-shore ? The chapter reads like an afterthought . <p> But what most fascinates Easterbrook is why the haves are n't happier . He offers a remarkably trenchant survey of psychologists ' thinking and research on the question of happiness along with Henny Youngman 's penetrating insight : " What good is happiness ? It ca n't buy money ? . ' He speculates on whether the satisfaction of so many material wants gives people the time and leisure to be depressed . He dissects the origins of modem stress . He wonders if concern about the future prevents us from enjoying the present . He suggests that our new-found ability to be alone ( in our houses , on our jobs , in our cars , on our computers ) denies us the pleasure of the company of others . And he suggests , though not in so many words , that we 're like the dog in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's chasing , and asks : " Now what ? " <p> Then he turns to sermonizing , with some strong arguments and a few interesting examples , that we would be better off if we had a more positive attitude and were more grateful , more forgiving , more spiritual . I 'm sure he 's right , but I doubt he will convince anyone who is n't already convinced . I think he knows that . ' Gradually moving beyond materialistic obsession , while discarding fashionable theories of pointlessness in order to reclaim a mostly hopeful view of the human prospect , " he writes , is the sort of change that " men and women must make for themselves ? ' <p> It 's hard to argue with that . I 'd add another ingredient : We 're short on idealistic , inspiring , and charismatic national leaders at the moment . I 've met and read about enough good souls working on college campuses and in small towns , and of selfless quests to alleviate disease and poverty in the Third World ( see Tracy Kidder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working in Haiti ) to avoid despair . I wish a couple of them had more prominence nationally or internationally . <p> The optimistic journalist is rarely held in high regard by his or her peers , ( I know : I wrote a book with a colleague in 1998 that argued that the American middle class would do better over the next 20 years than it did over the past 20 years . ) Those who predict calamity get more attention and often more respect . I suspect that 's always been true . Easterbrook 's goals here are , first , to persuade the reader that his optimism is justified and , second , to explain why people do n't seem to accept such a view . On the first , he provides plenty of ammunition to those who already agree with him but , I fear , not enough convincing argument or criticism of competing views to persuade any reader who does n't already see the world the way he does . On the second , the reader joins him on an often interesting intellectual quest , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> By David Wessel <p> <p> David Wessel , the deputy Washington bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal , writes a weekly column called " Capital . " <p>
