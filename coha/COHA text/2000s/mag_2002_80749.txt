With 78 nations competing in the Olympics , Salt Lake City is a Babel of languages . And no tongue is stranger  --  more exotic , more impenetrable  --  than English . At the Winter Games " toe picks " are n't used by guitar-playing monkeys but are the notches at the front of a figure skater 's blade . They 're used to perform " toe loops , " which sound like a cereal once endorsed by Lou Groza but are in fact figure skating jumps performed by the same people who do hydrants , Lutzes and Salchows . As for " camel spins "  --  they 're what you get in bed after smoking a carton of filterless cigarettes . // " Curling " is what happens to your chest hair when you take a swig of Polygamy Porter , an actual Utah beer whose slogan is , Why have just one ? Curling , though , is also an Olympic sport played largely between the " hog lines . " Hog lines also form at Olympic media bus stops , for few of the 8,418 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines you 'll find curling writers , whose prose frequently reads like this , from a press release from USA Curling : // " USA stole a single in the second end when Sweden 's last-rock draw for one was just slightly heavy . The middle ends were the toughest for the Americans . ' After that double for three in the third did n't work , we got a little flat , ' said Coach Bud Somerville , Tim 's father . But the Americans played the sixth well to force Sweden to draw for one against three U.S. counters . The dramatic seventh was set up by vice skip Mike Schneeberger , who made a raise takeout and rolled the shooter over to guard against another U.S. rock . Then came Lindholm 's draw , and eventually the counterpunch. " // If Maximilian Berlitz had covered the Olympics , he 'd have hanged himself from his headphone cord . // Consider that a " slider " is both a luge athlete and a kind of curling shoe . Thus , curlers often wear sliders , but sliders seldom wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All My Children . A slider shaking her " bootie " is a luger removing snow from her shoe . A slider who " eighty-ones " his " rodel " is a luger who crashes his racing sled . And a " slider with vinyl " remains , as ever , a White Castle cheeseburger. // " Mitt Romney " is how a German orders his eggs . A " biathlete " is nor Dennis Rodman . And " driving the skeleton " is what Jerry Buss 's chauffeur does . It is all very confusing . // For instance , a hockey team plays on a rink , but a curling team is a rink , and that rink plays on a " sheet . " The sheet , to hear curlers describe it , is composed  --  depending on conditions  --  of " heavy ice , " " straight ice " or " swingy ice . " Swingy ice is not an effeminate rapper but a sheet that has a lot of " curl " in it . But what , pray tell , is a " curly sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? // Snowboarding is best watched while wearing a U.N . General Assembly headset . You 'll need simultaneous translation of every utterance . For example , a " sick ho ho with backside rotation " does not necessarily describe one of Luther Campbell 's backup dancers but may refer to a hand-plant-and-twist maneuver in the halfpipe . ( A " halfpipe " is what boarders are forbidden to smoke in the weeks before Olympic competition . ) And a " wet cat " is a 900-degree rotation during a " McTwist . " ( A McTwist is an inverted aerial , and what Ronald McDonald gets his underwear in when you try to order breakfast after 10:30 . ) Snowboarders , you see , can be wonderfully descriptive  --  lyrical even . When a boarder loses balance in the air and rotates his arms wildly in an effort to recover , he is said to be " rolling down the windows . " // Freestyle skiers gave us the felicitous " yard sale , " for the kind of crash that leaves a skier 's arms , legs , skis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is also maddening for broadcasters , who have to know , in an instant , a " lay tuck tuck " from a " lay tuck full " from a " lay full tuck " from a " lay lay full " from a " lay full full " from a " half tuck half " from a " half half full " from a " half full half " from a " full tuck full " from a " full full full " from a " full double full tuck " from a " full double full full " from a " double full full full " from a " full double full double full . " // How much tuck turns a lay full tuck to a full double full double full ? Difficult to say , because my tongue is in a French braid . This much is certain , though : The next time you see some dude " ridin ' goofy , " do not alert Disneyland security . Just smile and say , " Dude , you are sick .
