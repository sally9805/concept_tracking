<p> Recently , the Cook County sheriff 's police raided a local establishment and impounded several video poker machines as well as the day 's take from the machines , nearly $1,500 . The Chicago Crime Commission has indicated that these machines have put tens of millions of dollars into the pockets of organized crime . <p> The owner of the establishment pleaded guilty to two counts of gambling , and his penalty was set at $250 . This fine was equal to the amount of money the owner took in before he had finished his morning coffee break . What kind of deterrent is that ? The raids were a result of a months-long undercover investigation that cost tens of thousands of dollars . Clearly , the state has to increase the penalties for illegal gambling if such police crackdowns are going to have any effect . <p> Meanwhile , the Village of River Grove has lost hundreds of thousands of dollars that it could have earned from the revenue-sharing pact that was incorporated into the Rosemont Casino package . This is a great deal of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as River Grove . <p> The state authority has held up the casino project , in part , because of concerns that organized crime figures would benefit from the proposal put forth by Emerald Casino . The point man for Emerald , Kevin Flynn , has proven himself to be incompetent and self-serving . <p> I do n't blame commissioners for covering their noses in his presence . However , there are other proposals out there , and I would hope that they be given prompt attention so that River Grove 's taxpayers might soon reap some benefit from people 's desire to wager . <p> I am not a gambler , I do not play the lottery and have never stepped foot on a casino boat . However , millions of Illinois residents do gamble . As long as that is the case , give them a pleasant casino in which to play the slots and put their losses back into their communities . That would be better than having them play video poker in the back room of a tavern and pump a fortune into the pockets of organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grove Village Board <p> In regard to public hearings on the tollway increase to be held today at 7 p.m. at various locations : <p> Naturally , none of the locations is close to populated areas where a mass of people will attend , and all of them are set for the same time on the same day .

Enthusiasm matters . <p> Don Baylor , the Chicago Cubs manager , may inwardly wish his team to win , but no one should manage a team who has n't been thrown out of a game at least once in defense of his team and plays that are decisive . <p> As I watch the manager , there or on television , the view of the Cubs ' manager in a continual nonchalant stance for the entire game(s) leaves me wondering if he likes baseball . <p> The Cubs have talent , reasonable pitching , a wonderful park and enthusiastic fans there and through television , but the lack of visible emotion by the manager , and sadly the team , leaves the fan anxious to give up as well . <p> I think what is lacking is enthusiastic leadership . Go , Cubs , go ! <p> Gene Malone , Kenosha , Wis . <p> I have been watching with great amusement the feud between the Cubs and the residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would develop some common sense , but apparently not , so I have a few points for them to consider . <p> Did you not notice that stadium there when you moved in ? <p> The Tribune Co. is not a charity organization and is in business to make money . <p> The Cubs do not owe you the right to see the games for free . In fact , for years you have been given the privilege , and it is at the Cubs ' discretion whether that continues . <p> The Cubs and the Tribune Co. have done more to help the community than you have ever done or could even think of doing . <p> You people act as if the Cubs owe you something , and by putting those screens up , they are being bad neighbors . Well , if someone were to look into my house to get a free peek , they would be called " Peeping Toms . " I also think that you should know that taking something without paying for it is stealing . If you want to see the games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be , then do what I and every other Cubs fan has to do : Buy a ticket ! <p> Larry Poindexter , <p> Woodstock <p> I was interested to read just how solicitous the city is being to the residents of Wrigleyville , and how much they want the neighborhood to preserve its quality of life . <p> Is n't this the same city that let Jerry Reinsdorf ruin the Armour Square neighborhood in order to build new Comiskey Park ? <p> Why is the city so caring about Wrigleyville , yet so callous toward Armour Square ? Could it be that the yuppies of Wrigleyville ( and its well-connected alderman , Bernie Hansen ) have clout , while the poor and lower middle-class folks of Armour Square did not ? <p> Fred Butzen , <p> North Center <p> As a vendor at both Chicago ballparks , I think I have a unique view about the battle between the Cubs and the fans . The Cubs want more money from ticket sales , so they want to expand the seats in the bleachers . The fans want pure baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cubs do ? They put up a screen to further alienate the fans and the homeowners in the area . <p> I just hope that cooler heads prevail before the neighborhood decides to try to vote the ballpark dry . It would only take 51 percent to vote any precinct dry . That would take money out of the Trib 's pocket . This would show the Cubs that the neighborhood is more important than any company . However , this would take a lot of money out of the pockets of people who need it more . For me and a lot of vendors , this is extra money to pay for school for my children . <p> I just hope they settle this in a way that makes both sides happy . <p> Ron Raney , North Park <p> Listening to the complaints of the neighbors of Wrigley Field about the behavior of Cubs fans , you 'd think we were hearing about Beirut in the early ' 80s " Cubs play hardball , " news story , April 4 . But in this entire stupid controversy about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation does n't seem to be getting addressed . <p> With the transformation of the rooftops on Waveland and Sheffield from local color to corporate culture over the last 15 or 20 years , we can be sure of one thing : The people paying $100 a seat for these perches are no longer neighborhood folks who just happen to live in cool buildings . No , they too probably drive to the neighborhood , take up parking spaces that locals feel they own , drink too much and run amok on their way back to the suburbs . <p> But since these barbarians are n't attending the game at Wrigley Field itself , it 's hardly fair to blame the Tribsters for their wanton behavior . <p> And since everyone agrees that the Cubs management has to address uncivilized behavior from its patrons , neighborhood activists ought to demand that the owners of various rooftop clubs  --  Murphy 's Bleachers , Hi-Tops , the Sports Corner , the Cubby Bear and Bernie 's  --  be held responsible for their contributions to this oh-so-sad urban horror show . <p> Bill Savage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chicago office tax division of Arthur Andersen .
