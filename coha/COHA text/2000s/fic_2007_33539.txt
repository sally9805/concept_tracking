Four marble gargoyles glared down from the roof of the stately home in San Francisco 's Sea Cliff district . A For Sale sign had been stabbed into the small patch of lawn beside the driveway . No one was home . She 'd just called , using her cell phone . A crisp ocean breeze whipped against her thin summer suit , causing her usually perfectly coiffed pale blond hair to fly askew as she opened the lockbox hanging from the doorknob with a Supra key , a computerized entry device . It would leave a record that she 'd been there , but at this point that hardly mattered . Inside the box was the house key , and she used it to enter . She knew the house well , with its overabundance of electronics gear , its lack of flowers and houseplants , and its need for colorful luxurious towels and a few candles to soften the bathrooms-all easy-to-remedy problems . The large living room looked untouched . Expensive gold and marble objets were exactly where she 'd last seen them . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not very original , but easy to get at . Any good burglar could find a wall safe no matter where it was hidden , anyway . She swung the picture aside and punched in the combination . The distinctive flatblack leather box was gone . Her heart sank . How could she prove-An ear-splitting crack , like a gunshot , echoed through the house . She started , holding her breath . It was a car backfiring , nothing more . But even as she thought that , she was struck with an eerie feeling about the house and felt an overwhelming need to get out of there . On rubbery legs , she headed toward the entry , when she heard a door slam . The sound came from the far side of the house , from the kitchen . She forced herself to stop , to be rational . The earlier sound could n't have been a gunshot , not in this neighborhood . Her imagination had run away with her , that 's all . The home owner must have just returned . Now , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She hurried to the kitchen . Sprawled out on the floor before her lay the body of a man , facedown . A gaping , bloody hole covered the base of his head , blood oozing all around him . No one could survive that , she thought . She turned cold , deathly cold , as she crept closer . Is it . . . ? Relief coursed through her . She could n't see his face , but his black hair was streaked with gray . He was older than the man she 'd feared he might be . Still , the world began to spin at the sight , and she immediately looked away , stumbling backward and gripping a countertop . Through the kitchen window , she saw the shadowy figure of a man dash from the house . Behind this home and its neighbors was an alleyway for garbage trucks , service deliveries , and the like . There , the man got into an older , black Volvo . She only saw him from behind , and he wore a flat gray cap with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black box . The color and shape were like that of the container she 'd expected to find in the safe . The one she 'd been looking for . . . He was taking it . . . getting away ! And at her feet lay a dead man . Then , completely unlike the normally composed , contained , self-controlled businesswoman that she was , Caterina Amalfi Swenson let out a string of curses . Angelina Amalfi hung up the phone and cha-cha-cha'ed her way around the living room of her Russian Hill penthouse apartment . Life was good . She was engaged ; she 'd lost the six pounds she 'd gained vacationing in Arizona-well , half ; and now . . . now ! . . . she could scarcely breathe she was so excited . Internationally known chef Jacques Poulon-Leliellul was going to be in San Francisco next Monday , and he wanted to meet with her , Angie Amalfi , to talk about assisting him in the writing of his next cookbook . Recipes from his restaurant in the city , which apparently was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted a local food writer to be involved . He 'd heard about her from a friend of a friend , and had his secretary phone to make an appointment if she was interested . Was she ever ! " Mr. Poulon-Leliellul is a creator of food , not sentences , " his secretary explained . " I understand completely , " Angie said , bursting with enthusiasm for the project . " I ca n't wait to meet him . " " You 'd be his ghostwriter , " the secretary added . Angie thought a moment-ghostwriters were called " ghosts " because they were unseen ; their names were n't given . Could she get around that ? She was sure she 'd do such a fantastic job that not only could she convince the chef to include her name on the cover , he 'd positively demand it . " I understand . " " Just one more thing , " the secretary warned . " Be sure you pronounce his name correctly . Americans tend to do really horrible things to French names . " " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The secretary sounded relieved . " You have a lovely accent , but keep in mind that he prefers Poulon-Leliellul . " " I 'll remember , " Angie promised . The conversation ended with another word of caution . " Noon on Monday . Be prompt . Chef Poulon-Leliellul demands punctuality . " " No problem , " Angie said , before lavishing thanks and a good-bye . As it was only Tuesday , she had an entire week to study his recipes , his culinary philosophy , and anything else she could learn about the man . That was plenty of time since the only other thing she had to do was to finalize her wedding plans . She still had a few decisions to make : what kind of wedding , where to have it , and when . Matter of fact , the only thing she 'd nailed down was who . She was just about to phone that " who " - her tall , handsome , broad-shouldered , blue-eyed fianc , San Francisco Homicide inspector Paavo Smith-with the exciting news when the phone rang again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
