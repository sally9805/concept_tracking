You 'll get lost , " she told him . " The same way you did in Seville-you nearly got us killed on those narrow streets . It 's your style , you think it 's cute . But it 's pouring cats and dogs . " He ignored the cliche . " How can I get lost ? I can see the cathedral from here . " They were staying in the Hotel Alhambra Palace , overlooking Granada , Brad Quigley and his longtime companion , Leonora Kling , experimenting to see if a vacation together might nudge their long relationship into marriage or breakup . She was in her fifties ; he was sixty ; they worked in different firms within the limpid backwater of Boston finance and had known each other , at first merely collegially , for fifteen years . Her position and income were equal to his ; her professional accomplishment shielded them both , to an extent , from the overhanging questions of any prolonged heterosexual connection . There was almost no reason why they could n't go on as they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet ... a small , brisk brunette , she was growing , he could see , brittle , her gestures jerkier , her temper quicker to flare , her judgments snappier and yet prone to sudden reversals and selfdoubts . Since exercise classes and conditioning gyms had become the fashion , Leonora looked too thin-deprived . Her fine  --  boned beauty conformed to the low-maintenance style of Cambridge and Beacon Hill . She did not deign to dye the gray from her hair , left long and pulled taut at the back , and the squint lines in her face were deepening , exaggerating her increasingly frequent expression of a slightly deaf person blaming you for not speaking louder . " My mother would want me to go , " he said . " Mi madre . She would want me to see the tombs of Ferdinand and Isabella . She loved them so . " " Do n't I know it , " Leonora said , though the two women had never met . The only other time Brad had been to Spain , twenty years ago , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing research for a romantic novel concerning the two monarchs and their only surviving child , the love-crossed Joanna the Mad . It had been a strange trip , beginning with a humiliating , to Brad , embarrassment when the busy clerk at the Madrid hotel , slipping in English , had called his mother " your wife . " The clerk had quickly , sizing them up , corrected it with a self-critical chuckle to " your mother , " but for Brad a confusion between his mother and his wife held an abysmal plausibility . Not that his mother looked the part , she was grayhaired and stout ; but he was forty , and freshly divorced , and what wife , really , would he ever know as well as he knew her ? Even as a fetus he had been attuned to her moods and inner workings ; she loomed to him less as another person than as an overarching weather . To dilute their relationship he had proposed that they invite along his fifteen-year-old daughter , Belinda , who had taken the divorce hardest . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hotel room every night , he remembered . His task had been to drive his companions each day out from Madrid to one of the towns-Segovia , Avila , Valladolid , Toledo-where his mother had found a lead , a hint of treasure , in the writings of Prescott and Washington Irving and John Foster Kirk , which had enchanted her in college . Although she could read some Spanish , she was shy of speaking it , and it fell to Brad to negotiate their tourism : " Por favor , donde esta el convento ? " His mother would gaze at some tombs within the convent , take a few notes , and once reached out and touched a marble foot , worn glossy by other touches , of funerary sculpture . " What a dear little pointed shoe , " she said . Yet he could not believe she was finding what she wanted , the key to crack open that opaque , late-medieval world and get it to spill its colorful mysteries within reach of her pen . The cities surrounding the traces of history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of burgeoning industrial development ; post  --  Franco Spain was hurrying to cast off its romantic isolation and the picturesque backwardness that had attracted centuries of infatuated travelers . Belinda , helplessly adolescent , lightly freckled and still bearing some baby fat , endured hours in the back of the little rented Fiat and politely tried to interest herself in the stultifying relics , from the Escorial to the castle and aqueduct in Segovia , that her grandmother had come so arduously far to see . All the girl asked , as reward for her patience during this week 's ordeal , was to visit the disco of the Madrid hotel , and this her guardians granted on the last night . She returned , while her insomniac father at last slept soundly in his room , around midnight , rosy and giddy and full of strange tales , for her grandmother 's ears , of Spanish boys-how they danced , how they somehow communicated , how happy they seemed to see her . Photograph // Separating from Leonora made Brad nervous ; they had been constantly together for six days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ querulousness that their peaceful intermittent evenings together in Boston did not reveal . So long the manager of her own life and of other people 's millions , she distrusted his management of their trip . In Seville he kept leading her , she felt , astray-his map-reading took them up narrow medieval streets abuzz with motor scooters and speeding taxis . She was afraid of falling into the traffic , or having her bag snatched by a passing pair of gypsies on a Vespa . She forbade Brad to give money to beggars , lest he attract a band of feather-fingered pickpockets . She was convinced that all taxi drivers were cheating them , even if their meters were on . Her demands taxed his poor Spanish beyond its means : " Ask him what those extra charges are for . Tell him he 's going the long way around . " She found scarcely endurable the cacophony of competing tour guides in the Alhambra , and in Cordoba complained , five centuries late , that the Spanish had crassly built a cathedral in the middle of the marvelous mosque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired the notion that one should not drink the faucet water in this country ; sin hielo had become one of his phrases , not always comprehended , and for her sake he was always sidling into dark , private-seeming bars and buying a plastic bottle of agua mineral . So it was with a relieved sense of private adventure that he set out , beneath his umbrella , on the puddled little lane that led to the town from the hotel . It twisted down through hairpin turns ; the cathedral quickly sank from sight behind tall shuttered housefronts and , as she had predicted , he became lost . The tiny lettering on his wet little map required fishing his reading glasses from the pocket of his reversible parka ; he kept drifting downward , hoping for a clarifying park or monument . At last he emerged into a broad boulevard roaring with commuter traffic . Only a few pedestrians hurried past under their umbrellas . Even inspected through reading glasses , the map offered no clue to where he was on it . Granada was more of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gypsy pickpocket having thin rainy-day pickings , jeered at him from the doorway of a closed bank . Brad was too proud , and too mournfully pleased with his drenched and solitary condition on this errand of obscure filial piety , to ask for guidance . His instinct was to walk uphill , back toward the hotel , itself lost from sight , where Leonora waited . For her sake he at last went to a news kiosk and asked the woman in charge , " Por favor , senora , donde esta la catedral ? " She gestured brusquely and gave the impatient answer , " Derecho , " which meant either to the right or straight ahead . He damply plodded on , missing the goad of his mistress 's tongue . The cathedral , entered by a side door near the altar , almost slipped by him . There were many more visitors inside than he had expected on this foul day , including several busloads of Japanese in transparent plastic raincoats . The recumbent effigies of the Catholic Sovereigns were easy to find , though hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nave on pompous marble sarcophagi . Brad joined a line of Japanese who seemed to know the ropes and found himself stepping down into a crypt beneath the sarcophagi . There , in a small vaulted space , behind bars , an arm 's length away , five plain , black , toylike lead coffins held the remains of King Ferdinand , Queen Isabella , their unbalanced daughter , Joanna 's unfaithful husband , Philip the Handsome of Burgundy-he died at twenty-eight , and his widow kept the embalmed body in her bedroom for years-and , in the smallest hexagonal lead box of all , the dust of a child , a child left out of guidebook history , which did report that Joanna 's madness had not impaired her fertility : two emperors and four queens could claim her as mother , and her insanity flickered down through generations of Hapsburgs . Whatever , Brad wondered , had made his own mother think that she could encompass in a work of her imagination these pious , benighted , casually cruel monarchs ? She would speak of Juana la Loca as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the masterful husband she had never had . Now she was herself in a box , buried cherrywood instead of lead in a low  --  ceilinged crypt , but the body reverting to its skeleton all the same . Her body in Spain had been overweight , and dressed in wintry American clothes , so that as Brad remembered her she sweated , pink-faced at the long lunches with him and Belinda on the hot sidewalks by the provincial plazas while they waited for the convents and churches to reopen , her bifocals misting as she consulted her guidebooks and notebooks . Yet , brave soul , she never complained of discomfort , or that she had come all this expensive way and was not finding what she wanted . Now her spirit , not as mad as Cousin Juana 's but fanciful , had brought him again to Spain , dragging poor nervous , brittle Leonora with him , who did n't trust even the faucet water . He must be nicer to Leonora , he resolved , emerging into the lifting rain and climbing back to the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break off the relationship as soon as they were back in Boston . The clouds overhead were breaking up , exposing ragged fragments of blue : an El Greco sky . In Madrid , which they had saved for the second week , she seemed to relax ; it looked to her like a grander Boston , with a bigger public garden and more centrally located art museums . Her taut dark looks and severe hairdo led several pedestrians to address her in Spanish , mistaking her for a native ; she liked this , blushing as she protested , " No , no , gracias-soy americana . " More quickly than he she learned her way around . In the Prado she found for him a little Goya , an odd painting of a dog , which he dimly remembered from his previous trip , on view in a kind of basement . It was not to be found among the Goya portraits of the royal court on the first floor . Girlishly proud of her Spanish managerial skills , Leonora led him up , through the tourist throngs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goya 's depressive last phase had been sequestered , like a mad person in the attic . He had remembered a complete dog , perhaps thinking of one by Francis Bacon ; in reality the painting was titled Half-Submerged Dog , and showed only a Thurberesque profile , a sketch Goya must have meant to return to . Brad wondered why he had treasured this memory for two decades . " I could n't let you not find your little dog , " Leonora said , he thought a bit possessively . " You 've always talked about it . " " I have ? " He felt as if he had never been in Madrid before . He could not spot the hotel where he and his mother and daughter had stayed , on a wide straight street where he had been politely , wordlessly given a ticket for making a U-turn . Only the grounds of the imperial palace , cropped cypresses seen from a balustrade , rang a faint bell ; the mismatched trio had walked there the first groggy afternoon and , resting his arms on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An exotic formality and gloom had seemed to arise from the gardens , with their boxy patterns of privet and truncated inky  --  green cypresses . Entry was forbidden , as Brad remembered it . The king was still youthful and revered , and Spain was clinging to his image as a safeguard against a return of civil chaos . Now the king was a beefy , good  --  natured sexagenarian , the prime minister was a socialist , euros had replaced pesetas as the coin of the realm , and the palace gardens were open to the public . Brad descended with Leonora into the once-forbidden grounds ; they seemed innocuous , chilly , and empty , just another piece of tourist Europe , as impersonally accepting of them as the hotel clerks who took their unmatching passports and handed them back without a flicker of CounterReformation puritanism . Leonora had become more kittenish than she was in Boston . " Was n't that clever of me , " she insisted as they left the Prado , " to find your little dog for you ? " " Perro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , it was very clever , dear . " From Madrid he and Leonora took a day trip to Toledo , by train . Their mood , near their vacation 's end , had turned lighthearted . She did not furiously object when , in the station , he gave a few coins to a gypsy with a dirty  --  faced infant sleeping in her arms . He had been to Toledo once before , but by car , with his madre and hija . They had had a flat tire on the way , and his doping out enough instructions to replace it with the spare had been one of his Spanish triumphs . The flat tire was all he remembered of that excursion except for an old ochre bridge , with studded wooden doors , that they had walked across in sunshine , Toledo massed behind them on a steep , congested hill . Today , too , was sunny . The train climbed through vineyards and freshly green fields for an hour and then stopped outside the city , on the other side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twittery English women who seemed to know the ropes to a red bus that quickly filled ; a large group of others from the train crossed the street and trooped away on a diagonal road . Watching them disappear , Brad envied them their secret , some sort of shortcut , with no fare . The bus , stymied by a few torn  --  up streets , dropped them off at a spot Brad could not locate on the map ; he got as lost as in Granada in the rain , while Leonora lost patience at his side . She needed a bottle of water , and was fearful of being robbed in the narrow , twisting streets . " Amazing , " he admitted , " how these Spaniards hide their cathedrals . " " But this is the biggest Gothic cathedral in Spain ! " She was almost wailing . " You 're the only man in the world who could totally not find it ! " When they did come upon it , and prowled amid its five huge aisles , he could not find in himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his mother , now as dead as Queen Isabella , and his younger daughter , now married and the mother of three , had marveled together at the exquisite choir stalls , the towering altarpiece , the elaborately robed carved Madonna dating from the old Visigothic church , and , most memorable of all , the Baroque hole , a piece of sky lined with Heavenly figures , incongruously broken into the Gothic vaulting behind the altar in the eighteenth century . It was as if they had been blind . They would have been weary after their adventure with the tire , and his mother would have had her checklist of sights to feed her fiction . Where had they parked ? It was hard to imagine his overweight , overheated mother laboring up and down the streets and stairs that he and Leonora dutifully traversed , from the old Jewish quarter in the west of the city to the Museo de Santa Cruz in the east . As they wearily leaned on a balustrade , he saw his bridge , glowing in the late-afternoon light . The train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I bet , " Brad told Leonora , " if we crossed that bridge , and walked to the left , we 'd come to the railroad station . " " What makes you think that ? " " I think this map shows it . " " You think . Why are there are no people on the bridge ? It goes nowhere . " " They would n't let a bridge stand that went nowhere . Remember all those people who did n't get on the bus but crossed the street and walked away diagonally ? They must have been walking to this bridge . Here it is , on the map . It 's called the Puente de Alcantara . " " How do we get down to it ? " It was a reasonable question , so Brad thought she was going to be reasonable . They were standing at a considerable height above the river ; several busy thoroughfares intervened . " I do n't know , " he confessed . " Maybe into that parking lot ; 1 think I see some steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her long years of being single had hardened a habit of self-preservation . " You think , " she said . " You do n't know . " " I know that bridge . We were all on it together . " " That was ages ago , you 're not even sure of that , I can tell from your voice . Look across the river : there 's no road on that side . Brad , I have news for you . I 'm taking the bus . I know where it leaves from . If you want to try your precious bridge , I 'll meet you at the station . Give me my return ticket . " " Oh , shit , never mind , " he told her . " We 'll go back and take the stuffy , expensive bus together . But it could have been a lyrical experience . " At heart he was relieved that he did n't have to plod down in search of the entry to the bridge , and that by defying him she had put some space between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black at the bus stop , a triangular square bustling with young Europeans stripped to their shorts and backpacks , Brad widened the distance by buying , at a portable stand , what he had been craving all day , a popsicle . " Do n't , " Leonora begged . " The bus will come . " " No , it wo n't , " he said . There was a type-vanilla inside a chocolate skin bumpy with small bits of nuts-that he especially craved ; he rarely saw them for sale around Boston , and men in business suits do n't eat popsicles anyway . " Want a bite he offered , poking it at his companion , with her gray  --  streaked hair and censorious frown . " I certainly do not . Eat it fast , you 're not allowed to eat on buses . What a baby . " And Leonora softly shrieked , with a panic deserving a graver emergency , when the bus pulled up in the next minute . In the squeeze at the door , he held the half-finished popsicle behind his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was horrified , as they took seats at the back , that he was still gnawing at the popsicle stick , with its fast  --  melting burden . She elaborated : " You 're a disgusting , selfish baby . " He waited to reply until he could say , " There . All gone . Nothing spilled . You may apologize whenever you want . What do I do with the stick ? Could you put it in your purse ? Please ? " The bus , avoiding the tom-up streets on its way out , crossed the river on a smooth highway bridge and pulled up across from the station within ten minutes . Enjoying his new , bumptious role of hostile bad boy , Brad said to Leonora , " Okay , smartie . We 're here forty minutes early , I hope you 're happy . " " I 'm not unhappy , " she said . Her anxious fury had abruptly given way to a softer , more experimental mood . Rather than cross the street to the station , she pointed at a vending machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can get me a bottle of water . " The insertion of the euro and the responsive thump of the cold bottle was a transaction satisfying to them both ; after two weeks in this country , they were learning the ropes . " Let 's walk down a little , " Leonora said , " to where you think you saw those people going to this bridge you say was so great . " " I did n't say it was great , it was just something I remembered . " The street turned an oblique corner and became , on the side nearer the river , bucolic and scarcely trafficked . Beyond a low stone wall the riverbank held tall grass dotted with poppies and white , daisylike flowers of a heraldic simplicity . The walk was short , scarcely a city block long , to the end of the old bridge , its fortified gates , its ochre arches . The road they had just traveled had been invisible , slightly sunken , from the other side . " So , I was right , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that Leonora had been right about access from the parking lot ; he could n't see any stairs . The approach would have been long and diagonal , on weary feet . " Okay , thanks , " he said . " Let 's catch the train . " " No , I want you to walk on the bridge . There 's time . How silly I was , Brad , not to trust you-it was so close . " The bridge had been unpopulated when they had viewed it before , but now whole families , from small children to patriarchal , black-clad men with canes , were strolling and dawdling between its waist-high walls . Leonora insisted on pulling her little camera from her purse and photographing Brad posing at the far end , with its elaborate tower and gate . The tall wooden doors , cracked and darkened with age , still bore the studs , heraldic metal florets in rigorous rows , that had been nailed into his memory . Here they had once stood , in the same warm dust , his mother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the moment amusing , or writing something in her notebook , but exactly what was long gone , and her novel had never been published . Leonora put her camera away and stood closer to Brad , in the heat the old stones radiated , than necessary-a European , rather than an American , conversational distance . " Now , was n't I nice , " she flirted , " to find you your dear mother 's bridge , after you were so mean ? " She had given him a bridge . " Oh yes , very , " he said . " You were very nice . I wo n't be mean ever again . " Her pale pointed face , in its hopeful uncertainty , its shy determination to be winning , had shed years ; it had drawn so close he smelled the shrimp paella they had shared for lunch , and the watery dark of her Spanish eyes swallowed him with its plea .
