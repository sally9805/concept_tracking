Chapter 1CLAY From my first breath in this world , all I wanted was a good set of lungs and the air to fill them with-given circumstances , you might presume , for an American baby of the twentieth century . Think about your own first gasp : a shocking wind roweling so easily down your throat , and you still slipping around in the doctor 's hands . How you yowled ! Not a thing on your mind but breakfast , and that was on the way . When I was born to Helen and Jeremiah Land , in 1951 , my lungs refused to kick in . My father was n't in the delivery room or even in the building ; the halls of Wilson Hospital were close and short , and Dad had gone out to pace in the damp September wind . He was praying , rounding the block for the fifth time , when the air quickened . He opened his eyes and discovered he was running  --  sprinting across the grass toward the door . " How 'd you know ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . " God told me you were in trouble . " " Out loud ? Did you hear Him ? " " Nope , not out loud . But He made me run , Reuben . I guess I figured it out on the way . " I had , in fact , been delivered some minutes before . My mother was dazed , propped against soggy pillows , unable to comprehend what Dr. Animas Nokes was telling her . " He still is n't breathing , Mrs. Land . " " Give him to me ! " To this day I 'm glad Dr. Nokes did not hand me over on demand . Tired as my mother was , who knows when she would 've noticed ? Instead he laid me down and rubbed me hard with a towel . He pounded my back ; he rolled me over and massaged my chest . He breathed air into my mouth and nose  --  my chest rose , fell with a raspy whine , stayed fallen . Years later Dr. Nokes would tell my brother Davy that my delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child with such swampy lungs . When Dad skidded into the room , Dr. Nokes was sitting on the side of the bed holding my mother 's hand . She was wailing  --  I picture her as an old woman here , which is funny , since I was never to see her as one  --  and old Nokes was attempting to ease her grief . It was unavoidable , he was saying ; nothing could be done ; perhaps it was for the best . I was lying uncovered on a metal table across the room . Dad lifted me gently . I was very clean from all that rubbing , and I was gray and beginning to cool . A little clay boy is what I was . " Breathe , " Dad said . I lay in his arms . Dr. Nokes said , " Jeremiah , it has been twelve minutes . " " Breathe ! " The picture I see is of Dad , brown hair short and wild , giving this order as if he expected nothing but obedience . Dr. Nokes approached him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His lungs ca n't fill . " Dad leaned down , laid me back on the table , took off his jacket and wrapped me in it  --  a black canvas jacket with a quilted lining , I have it still . He left my face uncovered . " Sometimes , " said Dr. Nokes , " there is something unworkable in one of the organs . A ventricle that wo n't pump correctly . A liver that poisons the blood . " Dr. Nokes was a kindly and reasonable man . " Lungs that ca n't expand to take in air . In these cases , " said Dr. Nokes , " we must trust in the Almighty to do what is best . " At which Dad stepped across and smote Dr. Nokes with a right hand , so that the doctor went down and lay on his side with his pupils unfocused . As Mother cried out , Dad turned back to me , a clay child wrapped in a canvas coat , and said in a normal voice , " Reuben Land , in the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The truth is , I did n't think much on this until a dozen years later  --  beyond , of course , savoring the fact that I 'd begun life in a dangerous and thus romantic manner . When you are seven years old there 's nothing as lovely and tragic as telling your friends you were just about dead once . It made Dad my hero , as you might expect , won him my forgiveness for anything that he might do forever ; but until later events it did n't occur to me to wonder just why I was allowed , after all , to breathe and keep breathing . The answer , it seems to me now , lies in the miracles . Let me say something about that word : miracle . For too long it 's been used to characterize things or events that , though pleasant , are entirely normal . Peeping chicks at Easter time , spring generally , a clear sunrise after an overcast week-a miracle , people say , as if they 've been educated from greeting cards . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice every day of the week , but to call them miracles evaporates the strength of the word . Real miracles bother people , like strange sudden pains unknown in medical literature . It 's true : They rebut every rule all we good citizens take comfort in . Lazarus obeying orders and climbing up out of the grave  --  now there 's a miracle , and you can bet it upset a lot of folks who were standing around at the time . When a person dies , the earth is generally unwilling to cough him back up . A miracle contradicts the will of earth . My sister , Swede , who often sees to the nub , offered this : People fear miracles because they fear being changed  --  though ignoring them will change you also . Swede said another thing , too , and it rang in me like a bell : No miracle happens without a witness . Someone to declare , Here 's what I saw . Here 's how it went . Make of it what you will . The fact is , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few witnesses but me . Yes , enough people saw enough strange things that Dad became the subject of a kind of misspoken folklore in our town , but most ignored the miracles as they ignored Dad himself . I believe I was preserved , through those twelve airless minutes , in order to be a witness , and as a witness , let me say that a miracle is no cute thing but more like the swing of a sword . If he were here to begin the account , I believe Dad would say what he said to Swede and me on the worst night of all our lives : We and the world , my children , will always be at war .
