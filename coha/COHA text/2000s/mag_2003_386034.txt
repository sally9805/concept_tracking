Section : Notebook How the String Cheese Incident  --  five barefoot , mandolin-plucking improvisers from Boulder  --  is taking on the most hated corporation in music <p> WHAT DO YOU CALL A COMPANY THAT HAS PRESERVED its near monopoly for more than a decade despite numerous antitrust lawsuits , that charges exorbitant fees to its captive customers , whose CEO is said to revel in the fact that he " crushed " one of America 's most beloved rock and roll bands when it dared to take the company on , that ( for these reasons and more ) is near the top of most American 's list of companies they love to hate ? Well , some people call it Ticketbastard , but Ticketmaster does n't mind , so long as people keep calling  --  and logging on and walking up to its outlets , which they did enough times last year to buy 95 million tickets , worth $4 billion , on behalf of its parent , Barry Diller 's InterActiveCorp . <p> They call , of course , because they have no other choice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment industry , scooping up the exclusive right to deal tickets for nearly 90 percent of the nation 's arenas and amphitheaters , and more than 70 percent of the clubs and theaters . And in the unlikely event that an artist is performing at a non-Ticketmaster venue , the company also has exclusive contracts with the country 's top promoters  --  Clear Channel , AEG , and House of Blues , among them  --  which together sell about 30 million tickets a year . <p> It 's an arrangement that makes sense for Ticketmaster 's promoter clients  --  and not only because it leaves them free to concentrate on getting people to turn out for a show rather than making sure that tickets are printed properly or that each seat is occupied by only one fanny . A part of each service charge is rebated to the promoter or venue , creating a steady income stream invisible to the consumer  --  a practice that , according to one recently signed client , is central to Ticketmaster 's sales pitch : " We 'll take all the heat , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " With its hardball tactics , indifference to public wrath , and technology that even its fiercest opponents acknowledge is spectacular , Ticketmaster is a juggernaut , one that leaves concertgoers fuming about having to pay what the company indelicately calls " convenience charges " that can cost more than 50 percent of the ticket ; about being forced to wait through Britney-on-hold to talk to a computer ; about having to deal with a corporate behemoth to indulge in rock and roll . <p> Resistance to Ticketmaster has proved futile  --  for performers as well as audiences . In a highly publicized fiasco nearly a decade ago , Pearl Jam tried to buck Ticketmaster , canceling its 1994 tour when service fees put prices over the $20 limit the band had vowed to maintain . An attempt to tour the next summer in non-Ticketmaster venues collapsed under its own logistical weight . And when neither congressional hearings nor an antitrust complaint filed with the Department of Justice led to any relief , opposition to Ticketmaster seemed crushed . <p> Pearl Jam could n't take Ticketmaster on in court because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the String Cheese Incident does , and in August the Colorado-based jam band filed an antitrust suit in federal court , alleging that Ticketmaster has used its exclusive deals-and colluded with another ticket dealer  --  to foreclose competition , to keep service charges high , and to interfere with other ticketing companies , all violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act . At issue are tickets that promoters hold back from the public for bands to use as they see fit  --  to give to friends or family , to use for promotion , or to sell directly to fans . ( SCI Ticketing essentially resells the tickets , pocketing only the service charges . ) <p> Ticketing is not the band 's only nonmusical enterprise . In fact , String Cheese Incident and its ancillary concerns comprise an entertainment mini-conglomerate big enough to nearly fill a two-story office building in Boulder . Friendly dogs roam the hallways that connect offices for the various businesses : a management company that handles affairs for String Cheese and other bands ; SCI Gear , which hawks T-shirts and stickers bearing the band 's distinctive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; SCI Fidelity , which produces albums for the band and other performers ; the Footprints fan community-service project ; even a travel agency that books accommodations for bands and fans on tour and helps String Cheese stage its International Incidents in places like Costa Rica . <p> In some ways , this vertical integration simply reflects the band members ' preference for control over their own affairs  --  " 50 percent perfectionism and 50 percent paranoia , " according to guitarist Bill Nershi . But it 's also a business model tailor-made for the music that String Cheese plays . The quintet has a wide-ranging musical vocabulary , but at its artistic heart is the attempt to use the many styles of popular music ( folk and bluegrass , jazz and rock , calypso and reggae ) as springboards for improvisation that reaches for musical ecstasies  --  bright flashes of inspiration that can catch an audience up in a Dionysian celebration of the moment of creation . It 's a risky approach to performance , and it depends on an audience willing to tolerate the inevitable detours and dead ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and financially , the fans ' devotion must be nurtured , according to String Cheese 's Michael Kang , who plays mandolin and violin . " It 's a minor miracle that we get to do what we get to do , " he told me . " It 's all because of the fans . We have to keep the connection alive . " <p> To judge from the numbers , String Cheese has succeeded in doing that . Nearly 300,000 tickets were sold to Incidents last year , mostly to a tie-dyed legion of fans who follow the band from town to town , creating a scene  --  part traveling Chautauqua , part ' 60s re-enactment camp  --  that would be familiar to an older generation that traipsed around after the Grateful Dead : parking lots where veggie burritos are sold by hemp-clad vendors listening to last night 's show on their boom boxes ; shows where fans greet each other with hugs and hang raptly on every note and lyric ; and do-it-yourself ticketing . Grateful Dead Ticket Sales has served Deadheads for 20 years , and like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone line in a candle shop owned by the brother of the band 's bassist ) builds fan loyalty by offering early sales of hotly demanded shows , tickets printed on icon-bearing stock , and a family sensibility that turns a ticket into a token of belonging to the String Cheese community . It 's an approach that leaves customers satisfied , even as the band grows . " You can still call and talk to a real person who has answers and is happy to help , " one ticket buyer told me . " You can still spot the staff at shows , boogying down with the rest of us . " <p> With so much at stake symbolically and financially , it 's no wonder String Cheese is willing to spend big money ( even before lawyers ' fees , litigation expenses are expected to exceed a million dollars ) to preserve its right to sell tickets to its own shows . But things were n't always this contentious between SCI Ticketing and Ticketmaster . Until fall 2001 , in fact , the two companies worked together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing business through Ticketmaster , which operated the ticketing page and fulfilled the orders . The two companies shared the service charges , and up to half of the band 's tickets were sold this way . But , says band manager Michael Luba , when tickets went on sale , " it would be a mad rush for the first 10 seconds , which would invariably blow up whatever system we were using . There were all sorts of other problems , like multiple charges . We would get letters from kids saying , ' I 'm defaulting on my student loans because Ticketmaster charged my credit card $3,000 when all I wanted was a $25 ticket . ' We got pushed to the brink where we had almost burned the bridge with our fans . " <p> So SCI Ticketing invested $250,000 in its own software and equipment and opened in September 2001 , selling more than 90,000 tickets in its first year with deeply discounted fees . ( An online customer buying two tickets , sent via ups , to each of four String Cheese shows on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would cost $365.25 from Ticketmaster  --  a $100 difference that , Luba likes to point out , is enough to buy a pair of tickets for another show , with money left over for gas to get there . ) This success is what provoked Ticketmaster , according to Luba , who thinks the company realized that " if a bunch of idiots from Colorado can figure out how to do this , then what 's to stop the New York Yankees or anyone else ? " <p> Terry Barnes , Ticketmaster 's CEO , confirms that in spring 2002 , his company was feeling pressured by online upstarts-not only by SCI Ticketing , but by a large number of band-run sites . " All of a sudden , " he told me , " band holds were going up and our inventory of tickets to sell to the public was going down . We felt that we had to act to protect our investment . " In May , Ticketmaster sent its clients a letter warning them that the practice of holding tickets for bands was getting out of hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their exclusive deals . A subsequent letter defined " excessive " as anything more than 8 percent of the seats  --  far lower than String Cheese 's usual allotment . In short order , promoters with Ticketmaster deals , or working in Ticketmaster venues , began to waffle on providing the band tickets , sometimes refusing outright . But String Cheese insisted on getting its customary allotments and was soon scrambling to find space in the dwindling number of non-Ticketmaster locations or , more often , haggling with nervous promoters over something once taken for granted . One show had to be moved on a moment 's notice , tickets already sold were declared invalid , and relations with promoters were strained to the point that , says Luba , some were reluctant to deal with the band . That slowed the company 's growth , SCI Ticketing already has clients besides String Cheese , including Steve Winwood and Charlie Hunter . But attempts to expand further , which its president , Jason Mastrine , says have included discussions with the White Stripes and Bob Dylan , have stalled because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give us tickets from show to show , band to band , year to year . " <p> Ticketmaster issued a press release denying that it is stifling competition from SCI Ticketing and accusing them of trying to " free-ride " on the infrastructure that it built . Luba disputes this charge . " If that 's the case , then do n't let us use it . Just let us in the building  --  we 'll use our system . " SCI Ticketing , Luba said , does n't want to compete for the entire range of ticketing services  --  phone , online , and walk-up outlets as well as ticket printing and reading  --  that Ticketmaster provides its client venues ; it only wants to sell tickets directly to fans . " We just want to serve the artists and the artists ' fans , " Luba says . <p> But the suit filed by SCI Ticketing alleges that an arrangement between Ticketmaster and another online ticketing service , Musictoday , shows that Ticketmaster wants to control any artist-to-fan ticketing it does allow . In the deal , worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for antitrust violations  --  as they had threatened to do when the May 2002 letters came out . In return , Ticketmaster agreed to tolerate excessive holdbacks  --  up to half the house for Musictoday 's biggest clients , the Dave Matthews Band , Phish , and the Dead . String Cheese claims that Musictoday and Ticketmaster have colluded to cut others out of the ticketing business . And according to Bert Foer , president of the American Antitrust Institute , the deal may prove fateful , much as Microsoft 's bundling arrangements did in its antitrust trials : " In the same sense , here you have a monopolist apparently using its monopoly power to discriminate among people that have to do business with it , and giving favors to those who play the game , which is to reduce competition . " <p> Many in the industry wonder why SCI Ticketing does n't seek a safe harbor like Musictoday did . Robert Tucker , the former head of ticketing for Musictoday , recently cut a similar deal with Ticketmaster to do fan ticketing for Radiohead . Tucker says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal battle  --  advice he is sure Luba will ignore . Still , Tucker seems to admire the band 's unyielding position . " Everybody else is doing as much as they can not to incur the wrath of Ticketmaster , " he says . " String Cheese is probably at the most adventurous edge of righteousness . " <p> It 's an edge where the band seems ready to make a prolonged stand . Soon after the lawsuit , SCI Gear released a new T-shirt sporting a String Cheese-ified " Do n't Tread on Me " logo , capturing the revolutionary American principle that , according to the band , makes the adventure worth taking . " The thick stream that runs through the history of the band is not ever taking the easy way out , " Kang , the mandolin and fiddle player , told me . " As painful and hard as this is , we 'd rather stick it out on our own . " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Gary Greenberg <p>            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
