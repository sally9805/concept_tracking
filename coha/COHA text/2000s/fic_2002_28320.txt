Although Keevan lengthened his walking stride as far as his legs would stretch , he could n't quite keep up with the other candidates . He knew he would be teased again . Just as he knew many other things that his foster mother told him he ought not to know , Keevan knew that Beterli , the most senior of the boys , set that spanking pace just to embarrass him , the smallest dragonboy . Keevan would arrive , tail fork-end of the group , breathless , chest heaving , and maybe get a stern look from the instructing wingsecond . Dragonriders , even if they were still only hopeful candidates for the glowing eggs which were hardening on the hot sands of the Hatching Ground cavern , were expected to be punctual and prepared . Sloth was not tolerated by the Weyrleader of Benden Weyr . A good record was especially important now . It was very near hatching time , when the baby dragons would crack their mottled shells , and stagger forth to choose their lifetime companions . The very thought of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To be chosen -- to be a dragonrider ! To sit astride the neck of a winged beast with jeweled eyes : to be his friend , in telepathic communion with him for life ; to be his companion in good times and fighting extremes ; to fly effortlessly over the lands of Pern ! Or , thrillingly , between to any point anywhere on the world ! Flying between was done on dragonback or not at all , and it was dangerous . Keevan glanced upward , past the black mouths of the weyr caves in which grown dragons and their chosen riders lived , toward the Star Stones that crowned the ridge of the old volcano that was Benden Weyr . On the height , the blue watch dragon , his ridermounted on his neck , stretched the great transparent pinions that carried him on the winds of Pern to fight the evil Thread that fell at certain times from the skies . The many-faceted rainbow jewels of his eyes glistened fleetingly in the greeny sun . He folded his great wings to his back , and the watch pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view was obscured as Keevan passed into the Hatching Ground cavern . The sands underfoot were hot , even through heavy wher-hide boots . How the bootmaker had protested having to sew so small ! Keevan was forced to wonder why being small was reprehensible . People were always calling him " babe " and shooing him away as being " too small " or " too young " for this or that . Keevan was constantly working , twice as hard as any other boy his age , to prove himself capable . What if his muscles were n't as big as Beterli 's ? They were just as hard . And if he could n't overpower anyone in a wrestling match , he could outdistance everyone in a footrace . " Maybe if you run fast enough , " Beterli had jeered on the occasion when Keevan had been goaded to boast of his swiftness , " you could catch a dragon . That 's the only way you 'll make a dragonrider ! " " You just wait and see , Beterli , you just wait , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contemptuous smile from Beterli 's face , but the guy did n't fight fair even when a wingsecond was watching . " No one knows what Impresses a dragon ! " " They 've got to be able to find you first , babe ! " Yes , being the smallest candidate was not an enviable position . It was therefore imperative that Keevan Impress a dragon in his first hatching . That would wipe the smile off every face in the cavern , and accord him the respect due any dragonrider , even the smallest one . Besides , no one knew exactly what Impressed the baby dragons as they struggled from their shells in search of their lifetime partners . " I like to believe that dragons see into a man 's heart , " Keevan 's foster mother , Mende , told him . " If they find goodness , honesty , a flexible mind , patience , courage -- and you 've got that in quantity , dear Keevan -- that 's what dragons look for . I 've seen many a well-grown lad left standing on the sands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or tall or handsome . And if my memory serves me "  - -  which it usually did : Mende knew every word of every Harper 's tale worth telling , although Keevan did not interrupt her to say so --  " I do n't believe that F'lar , our Weyrleader , was all that tall when bronze Mnementh chose him . And Mnementh was the only bronze dragon of that hatching . " Dreams of Impressing a bronze were beyond Keevan 's boldest reflections , although that goal dominated the thoughts of every other hopeful candidate . Green dragons were small and fast and more numerous . There was more prestige to Impressing a blue or brown than a green . Being practical , Keevan seldom dreamed as high as a big fighting brown , like Canth , F'nor 's fine fellow , the biggest brown on all Pern . But to fly a bronze ? Bronzes were almost as big as the queen , and only they took the air when a queen flew at mating time . A bronze rider could aspire to become Weyrleader ! Well , Keevan would console @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that was n't bad . He 'd even settle for a green dragon : they were small , but so was he . No matter ! He simply had to Impress a dragon his first time in the Hatching Ground . Then no one in the Weyr would taunt him anymore for being so small . Shells , Keevan thought now , but the sands are hot ! " Impression time is imminent , candidates , " the wingsecond was saying as everyone crowded respectfully close to him . " See the extent of the striations on this promising egg . " The stretch marks were larger than yesterday . Everyone leaned forward and nodded thoughtfully . That particular egg was the one Beterli had marked as his own , and no other candidate dared , on pain of being beaten by Beterli at his first opportunity , to approach it . The egg was marked by a large yellowish splotch in the shape of a dragon backwinging to land , talons outstretched to grasp rock . Everyone knew that bronze eggs bore distinctive markings . And naturally , Beterli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the biggest of the candidates , had chosen it . " I 'd say that the great opening day is almost upon us , " the wingsecond went on , and then his face assumed a grave expression . " As we well know , there are only forty eggs and seventy-two candidates . Some of you may be disappointed on the great day . That does n't necessarily mean you are n't dragonrider material , just that the dragon for you has n't been shelled . You 'll have other hatchings , and it 's no disgrace to be left behind an Impression or two . Or more . " Keevan was positive that the wingsecond 's eyes rested on Beterli , who 'd been stood off at so many Impressions already . Keevan tried to squinch down so the wingsecond would n't notice him . Keevan had been reminded too often that he was eligible to be a candidate by one day only . He , of all the hopefuls , was most likely to be left standing on the great day . One more reason why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now move about among the eggs , " the wingsecond said . " Touch them . We do n't know that it does any good , but it certainly does n't do any harm . " Some of the boys laughed nervously , but everyone immediately began to circulate among the eggs . Beterli stepped up officiously to " his " egg , daring anyone to come near it . Keevan smiled , because he had already touched it -- every inspection day , when the others were leaving the Hatching Ground and no one could see him crouch to stroke it . Keevan had an egg he concentrated on , too , one drawn slightly to the far side of the others . The shell had a soft greenish-blue tinge with a faint creamy swirl design . The consensus was that this egg contained a mere green , so Keevan was rarely bothered by rivals . He was somewhat perturbed then to see Beterli wandering over to him . " I do n't know why you 're allowed in this Impression Keevan . There are enough of us without a babe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm of age . " Keevan kept his voice level , telling himself not to be bothered by mere words . " Yah ! " Beterli made a show of standing on his toe tips . " You ca n't even see over an egg ; Hatching Day , you better get in front or the dragons wo n't see you at all . ' Course , you could get run down that way in the mad scramble . Oh , I forget , you can run fast , ca n't you ? " " You 'd better make sure a dragon sees you , this time , Beterli , " Keevan replied . " You 're almost overage , are n't you ? " Beterli flushed and took a step forward , hand halfraised . Keevan stood his ground , but if Beterli advanced one more step , he would call the wingsecond . No one fought on the Hatching Ground . Surely Beterli knew that much . Fortunately , at that moment , the wingsecond called the boys together and led them from the Hatching Ground to start on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replenished in the main kitchen caverns and sleeping cubicles , the major hallways , and the queen 's apartment . Firestone sacks had to be filled against Thread attack , and black rock brought to the kitchen hearths . The boys fell to their chores , tantalized by the odors of roasting meat . The population of the Weyr began to assemble for the evening meal , and the dragonriders came in from the Feeding Ground on their sweep checks . It was the time of day Keevan liked best : once the chores were done but before dinner was served , a fellow could often get close enough to the dragonriders to hear their talk . Tonight , Keevan 's father , K'last , was at the main dragonrider table . It puzzled Keevan how his father , a brown rider and a tall man , could be his father -- because he , Keevan , was so small . It obviously puzzled K'last , too , when he deigned to notice his small son : " In a few more Turns , you 'll be as tall as I am -- or taller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . The dragonriders were relaxing . There 'd be no Thread attack for three more days , and they 'd be in the mood to tell tall tales , better than Harper yarns , about impossible maneuvers they 'd done a-dragonback . When Thread attack was closer , their talk would change to a discussion of tactics of evasion , of going between , how long to suspend there until the burning but fragile Thread would freeze and crack and fall harmlessly off dragon and man . They would dispute the exact moment to feed firestone to the dragon so he 'd have the best flame ready to sear Thread midair and render it harmless to ground -- and man -- below . There was such a lot to know and understand about being a dragonrider that sometimes Keevan was overwhelmed . How would he ever be able to remember everything he ought to know at the right moment ? He could n't dare ask such a question ; this would only have given additional weight to the notion that he was too young yet to be a dragonrider . " Having older candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keevan settled down near the table . " Why waste four to five years of a dragon 's fighting prime until his rider grows up enough to stand the rigors ? " L'vel had Impressed a blue of Ramoth 's first clutch . Most of the candidates thought L'vel was marvelous because he spoke up in front of the older riders , who awed them . " That was well enough in the Interval when you did n't need to mount the full Weyr complement to fight Thread . But not now . Not with more eligible candidates than ever . Let the babes wait . " " Any boy who is over twelve Turns has the right to stand in the Hatching Ground , " K'last replied , a slight smile on his face . He never argued or got angry . Keevan wished he were more like his father . And oh , how he wished he were a brown rider ! " Only a dragon -- each particular dragon -- knows what he wants in a rider . We certainly ca n't tell . Time and again the theorists , " K'last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , " are surprised by dragon choice . They never seem to make mistakes , however . " " Now , K'last , just look at the roster this Impression . Seventy-two boys and only forty eggs . Drop off the twelve youngest , and there 's still a good field for the hatchlings to choose from . Shells ! There are a couple of weyrlings unable to see over a wher egg much less a dragon ! And years before they can ride Thread . " " True enough , but the Weyr is scarcely under fighting strength , and if the youngest Impress , they 'll be old enough to fight when the oldest of our current dragons go between from senility . " " Half the Weyr-bred lads have already been through several Impressions , " one of the bronze riders said then . " I 'd say drop some of them off this time . Give the untried a chance . " " There 's nothing wrong in presenting a clutch with as wide a choice as possible , " said the Weyrleader , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Has there ever been a case , " she said , smiling in her odd way at the riders , " where a hatchling did n't choose ? " Her suggestion was almost heretical and drew astonished gasps from everyone , including the boys . F'lar laughed . " You say the most outrageous things , Lessa . " " Well , has there ever been a case where a dragon did n't choose ? " " Ca n't say as I recall one , " K'last replied . " Then we continue in this tradition , " Lessa said firmly , as if that ended the matter . But it did n't . The argument ranged from one table to the other all through dinner , with some favoring a weeding out of the candidates to the most likely , lopping off those who were very young or who had had multiple opportunities to Impress . All the candidates were in a swivet , though such a departure from tradition would be to the advantage of many . As the evening progressed , more riders were favoring eliminating the youngest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Keevan felt he could bear such a dictum only if Beterli were also eliminated . But this seemed less likely than that Keevan would be turfed out , since the Weyr 's need was for fighting dragons and riders . By the time the evening meal was over , no decision had been reached , although the Weyrleader had promised to give the matter due consideration . He might have slept on the problem , but few of the candidates did . Tempers were uncertain in the sleeping caverns next morning as the boys were routed out of their beds to carry water and black rock and cover the " glows . " Twice Mende had to call Keevan to order for clumsiness . " Whatever is the matter with you , boy ? " she demanded in exasperation when he tipped black rock short of the bin and sooted up the hearth . " They 're going to keep me from this Impression . " " What ? " Mende stared at him . " Who ? " " You heard them talking at dinner last night . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mende regarded him a moment longer before touching his arm gently . " There 's lots of talk around a supper table , Keevan . And it cools as soon as the supper . I 've heard the same nonsense before every hatching , but nothing is ever changed .
