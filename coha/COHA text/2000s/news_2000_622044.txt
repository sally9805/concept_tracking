<p> Northern Mountain Supply reinvented itself by going online . <p> For more than 22 years , the Eureka company sold camping and other outdoor equipment at its retail store . Then , in 1996 , Scott Sway , the company 's president , decided to set up Northernmountain.com and a digital catalog . Since then , the company 's workforce has grown to 26 from 12 . In less than two years , sales have doubled and profits are up , too . <p> " Being located behind the redwood curtain ' in Humboldt County , we do n't have local access to a lot of supplies and resources , " said Sway . Going online overcame that obstacle . <p> The company found its business software and buys many of its supplies on the Web . It markets almost exclusively via search engines , and Sway said the company researches information online " before virtually every major decision . " <p> Sway is one of dozens of Northern California business owners who responded to a recent Chronicle survey of readers about their online experiences . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers , expand their markets and increase their efficiency . <p> The cost of going online can range from nothing for free services on the Web to many thousands of dollars for fee services and professional advice . <p> While some businesses have found nirvana on the Web , others have found it nerve-racking , costly and a huge investment of time . <p> On the plus side , the Loomis Group , a 50-person , 12-year-old San Francisco advertising/public relations agency , began using the Internet five years ago to send creative work to clients . <p> Carol Walker , the agency 's media relations manager , said the move has saved " tremendous time and money " compared with sending the design by FedEx or taking it in person to the client . Loomis also uses Web kiosks to let clients view all invoices , PR materials and ads on their own terminals . <p> Edward Bell , owner of a San Rafael executive search firm of the same name , says urgency is the name of the game in his industry , too . He finds the Internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quickly e-mailing job information and resumes back and forth between companies and candidates . <p> Brandt Williams , president of Group S in Alameda , also is a fan of online services " to speed up the startup process . " His company , which is developing online sales productivity tools , turned to another online company called HRPath.com to set up a hiring structure , including employee handbook and application forms , as well as insurance coverage and payroll services . Williams also endorses online recruiting services such as Monsterboard and Career.com . <p> At AquaPrix , a Hayward company that distributes water purification systems , " we are always looking for ways to stretch every dollar , " said chief executive Lynne Leahy . That 's why she has turned to the Internet for office support services like payroll and banking . " Online means it 's done instantly , " she said . <p> Although it primarily markets the water systems to corporations , AquaPrix also has some products for consumers , which it sells on its Web site . It hopes to expand that e-commerce function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sending out twice-monthly updates with tips and news about drinking water . <p> She would like to buy office supplies online but has found that Web sites have a more limited selection than superstore catalogs . And she is hoping to expand into barter for advertising and other services . <p> You do n't have to operate in Silicon Valley or deal with high-tech types to get hooked on the Net . The Great Plate Bar &; Grill in Tracy uses the eBay auction site to buy items ranging from plates , silverware and pizza pans to sound equipment and copier toner cartridges . The restaurant uses the Net to buy " most everything but food , " says co-owner Shawn Perry . <p> When a piece of equipment breaks down , Perry likes going online to find tech support or repair manuals . He said the restaurant used Microsoft FrontPage to develop a Web site to attract new customer traffic . <p> Joyce Hooks , owner of Timeout for Fun and Games in Oakland , is expanding her Web site from solely providing information to selling chess sets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to CloudSource , an Oakland startup that specializes in offering small businesses custom Web sites for a fixed fee , and is eagerly awaiting promised e-commerce features . <p> Some budding entrepreneurs say they owe their business concept to the Internet . <p> For example , Izabel Loinaz is a flamenco dancer who needed a day job . So a year ago , she started a personal assistant service called Peace of Mind for individuals and businesseses . <p> For $25 to $45 an hour , the San Francisco resident will organize a garage or entire office and do chores like picking up dry cleaning for time-pressed clients . But Loinaz spends most of her work hours on the Web , researching products and services and buying them for customers . <p> She said her favorite online small-business Web sites for general information are Onvia.com , AllBusiness.com and the Small Business Administration 's SCORE site . She likes the Professional Organizers Web Ring and the National Association of Professional Organizers for networking , marketing tips and checking out the competition . <p> When she developed her own Web site , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prices to ensure she gets the best price for her customers , Loinaz visits Epinions.com , Productopia.com , Deja.com , PriceWatch.com and About.com . She said she gets the best price , including shipping costs , on most equipment from Palm units to photo scanners from Buy.com . She also likes Webvan and Amazon.com . <p> Although some users find they often spin their wheels on the Web , Loinaz said , " I have been doing it long enough that I usually know exactly where to find what my customers want at the best price in half the time it would take me to drive anywhere in this city . " However , she admits it is sometimes nice to see and touch before buying . <p> Some buyers find it necessary to visit real stores . <p> Brent Bardsley , who operates Applied Bioengineering out of his home in Cupertino , believes online shopping services should give customers at least as much product information as they might find in a store . <p> But when he visited OfficeSupplies.com , he was dismayed to find that 's not necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refills but gave up when he could n't get product photos or precise measurements to ensure that he was buying the right product . He also ran aground trying to buy HP Bright Paper because it was n't stated whether the $5.56 price was for 250 or 500 sheets . <p> Many entrepreneurs find it even more difficult to set up a Web site and e-commerce services . <p> Ric Lobosco took his San Rafael management consulting firm , Allies Consulting Services , online five years ago and vividly remembers all the problems , beginning with a defective USRobotics modem . <p> Finding the right Internet service provider was n't a snap , either . Lobosco started with America Online , shifted to Best Internet and now is considering changing to Advanced Telecom Group and upgrading to faster DSL service . <p> " Much of dealing with the Internet and getting various services is a headache for the nontechnical and uninitiated , " said Lobosco . Even though he has a technical background and was able to resolve some problems , he said creating a Web site was a nightmare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impression of fabulous results in a short time , when the truth is far different , " he warns . Many developers " do n't try to learn about the company 's business or needs and are more concerned with their own ego and agenda . They get a business to pay for the developer 's chance to show off , ' and the result is a hideous mix of terrible site structure , inappropriate graphics , poor marketing materials , etc . " <p> Nevertheless , Lobosco figures that in the long run , going online will save his management consulting firm time and money . <p> " It 's about building our brand and educating our prospects , " said Lobosco . " Instead of printing up materials and mailing them , which is costly in time and money , we have information on the Internet , which is easy to change and always there .
