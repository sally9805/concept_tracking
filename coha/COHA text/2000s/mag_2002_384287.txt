Five-step plans for clear SKIN , healthy HAIR , and a mess-free MAKEUP BAG . // DETOX YOUR skin Whatever your winter-complexion woes , get a fresh start with this speedy renewal plan , developed with aesthetician and Repechage founder Lydia Sarfati. 1 . Steam : Steaming softens debris in your pores and prepares your skin for the rest of the facial . Incorporating aromatherapeutic herbs such as chamomile and rose will help relax you . Boil four cups of water , then pour into a bowl over four tablespoons of herbs ( try Better Botanicals Facial Steam , $14.99 , left ) . Cover your head with a towel and hold your face about 15 inches above the steam for five minutes . Splash your face with lukewarm water . 2 . Cleanse : Since winter 's scant humidity has probably left your skin dry and sensitive  --  even if it 's oily below the surface-it 's best to remove dirt with a soothing cream cleanser . If you 're super-dehydrated , look for an ingredient such as soy proteins , wheat proteins , natural oils , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your skin . ( Try BlissLabs Fully Loaded Cleansing Milk , $23 , left , or Repechage Hydra 4 Cleanser , $32. ) 3 . Exfoliate : Dull , lifeless skin cells can make you look , well , dull and lifeless . Exfoliation is the key to letting your glow show , but gritty scrubs can damage skin . Two nonabrasive alternatives : The Earth Therapeutics Cosmetic Cloth , $10 , far left , is made of soft exfoliating fibers . Or try a scrub with a gentle sloughing ingredient , such as jojoba beads or polyethylene beads , plus a humectant , such as honey ( try Aqua Dessa Spa Therapy Honey Buff Facial Scrub , $25 ) . 4 . Unclog : Now your pores are ready for de-Bunking . Though nothing can permanently shrink them , a clay mask will draw out the stuff clogging them , leaving pores looking smaller and tighter . ( Try Geom6r Herbal Detox Mask with Glycolic Acid , $35 , or Urban Decay Urban Defense Skincare Tub-O-Mud , $24 , left. ) 5 . Moisturize : No , Grandma was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . Dryness can make you look older , and it does n't feel great either . Pick a creamy moisturizer with UVA and UVB protection ( try Avon Age Block Environmental Protection Cream , $12.50 , left ) . If you 're more oily , opt for an oil-free lotion ( try Biotherm Biosensitive Fluide SPF 12 , $30 ) . REHAB FOR YOUR hair Lots of women let their hair go during the winter . Get your mane back in ready-to-flaunt shape with these expert-approved tips . 1 . Get a cut : Hair is usually left longer and bulkier in winter , says stylist Edward Tricomi , co-owner of New York 's Warren-Tricomi Salon . But as humidity sneaks back into the atmosphere , it causes hair to fluff up . To counteract that pouf , you do n't have to do anything drastic ( unless you want to ) ; simply ask your stylist to give your hair a few layers or remove a little weight . ( The scissors shown here are just a little artistic license . We don't-we repeat , don't-recommend taking matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a professional haircut , not merely a straight-across trim. ) 2 . Remove buildup : Styling-product crud can make your hair dull , greasy , or flat . If you 've let your hair get a little too long over the winter , you may have OD 'd on products to keep it under control , says Paul Wallace , senior director of research and development for Clairol . The best advice here is still the tried and true , says Wallace : Use a clarifying shampoo ( try Charles Worthington Dream Hair Unbelievably Clean Total Detox Shampoo , $14 , left ) once a week . Follow it with conditioner . On the days you 're not clarifying , suds up with a moisturizing shampoo ( try Tresemme Hydrology Intense Moisture Shampoo , $3.89 ) . 3 . Remoisturize : Freezing-cold temps and biting winds can leave your scalp flaky and your strands dry and brittle . Leave-in conditioners are great everyday tress-soothers , but they tend to be absorbed by the hair before they get to the scalp , says Wallace .

Boost shine : Shine is a phenomenon that occurs when your hair 's cuticle ( its outer  --  most layer ) lies flat and thus reflects light . But cold weather , excessive brushing , and chemical treatments ( dye jobs and perms , for example ) can rough up the cuticle , causing it to peel and scatter light , so you get less shine . Certain ingredients-silicone is the best-can form a light film over your hair , temporarily flattening the cuticle . When hair is dry , rub a few drops of a silicone-based serum from roots to ends . ( Try Graham Webb Vivid Color Reparative Shine , $19.95 , left. ) 5 . Seal in glossiness : Silicone evaporates quickly , often leaving you sans shine by lunchtime . To enhance shine 's staying power , mix your serum ( #4 ) with a longer-lasting gel , suggests Chuck Warren , senior director of research and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then rub over hair 's surface ( try Got 2B Spiked-Up Max-Control Styling Gel , $6.49 , left ) . For a weeklong shine fix , the day after you clarify , apply a hot-oil treatment before you suds up , leave it on for one minute , then shampoo ( try Alberto V05 Smoothing Treatment with Chamomile &; Raspberry , $3.29 for two tubes ) . Positively charged polymers in the oil will bond to negatively charged damaged strands , helping the cuticle lie flat , says Perry Romanowski , research-and-development project leader for Alberto Culver . GIVE YOUR makeup A MAKEOVER Cynde Watson , a Bobbi Brown Cosmetics makeup artist , picks spring 's five essentials . 1 . A foundation stick : Wax-based sticks are great for two reasons : Since they contain some emollients but are n't too greasy , they work for all skin types , and most are designed to double as a concealer . To find the right shade , go to a department store , swatch two colors on your jaw , blend them in ( but not together ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The patch that has disappeared is the hue for you . ( Try Bobbi Brown Foundation Stick , $35 , left. ) 2 . A sheer powder : A lightweight powder with a hint of tint will add a little color to your complexion without giving you a too-done-up pancake look . Loose and pressed powders are equally effective , but pressed is less messy and usually comes with a puff and a mirror-perfect for toting . Choose a shade that works with your undertones . ( Try Hard Candy Peace Powder in Sheer , $26.50 , left , or Cover Girl Clean Pressed Powder , $3.60. ) 3 . A double- or triple-duty mascara : Thanks to modern mascara formulas , one swipe of the right wand can nix the need for lash curlers and false eyelashes . Lush up your lashes with a tube that does two or three of the following : lengthens , thickens , curls , separates . Black is , as always , the most versatile color , but dark brown and midnight blue are nice alternatives . ( Try Pupa Flex-Up Mascara in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) 4 . An eye-color palette : How to pick the perfect palette ? Look for one with , at the very least , three shades that serve different purposes : a natural hue ( such as bone or gray ) that works as a base color for your entire lid , a dark color ( think navy blue or black ) that you can use in the creases of your lids or as liner , and a seasonal hue ( such as lavender or aquamarine ) to get the look of the moment . ( Try Stila Ceylon Green from the High Tea Collection , $28 , left , or Merle Norman Luxiva Lasting Eyecolor Trio in Playful , $17. ) 5 . A lip-and-cheek tint : Using the same shade on your lips and cheeks is a goof-proof way to give balance to your face . For spring , your best color bets are light berry , coral , and mauvy brown . Do n't worry about overdoing it : The stains of today go on sheer for a naturallooking flush .

Photograph Photograph Photograph Photograph Photograph // AND WHEN It 's hard to ditch your favorite lipstick . But makeup that 's been around too long can create more than just clutter ; it can also cause an infection ! L.A. makeup artist Julie Hewett offers these three telling tests . - By Jolene Edgar 1 . Time test : Since most cosmetics have a finite shelf life ( one exception : loose powders ) , try to keep track of their age . Mascara is the quickest to cause trouble . Every time you remove the wand , you expose the mascara to airborne bacteria . To minimize your risk of an eye infection , buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule , replace other products once a year ( unless the product fails one of the other tests sooner ) . 2 . Smell test : Lipsticks , foundations , and concealers can be quality-checked with a quick sniff . All wax-based products-even those labeled " fragrance free " - are slightly scented to hide their waxy smell . As they age , the fragrance dissipates , revealing their unpleasant ( almost rancid ) base aroma . If you smell a funky odor , it 's time to toss . 3 . Sight test : There 's really no risk of bacterial infection with powder eyeshadows or pressed powders , since you 're constantly brushing off the top layer , but you should still trash them when they 're cracked or cakey-looking to preserve peak color performance . ( That repeated brushing motion also deposits oils from your face onto the powder , making the pigment less consistent . ) One last sight warning : When liquid products ( such as foundation ) separate as oils rise to the top of the bottle , chuck " em .
