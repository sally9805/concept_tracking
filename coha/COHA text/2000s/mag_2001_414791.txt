SOME OF ITALY 'S BEST BOTTLES ARE AS CLOSE AS YOUR CORNER STORE // IN ITALY , WINE IS everywhere-in every province , on every table , and in the blood of every man , woman , and , yes , child . No wonder , then , that just about everything Italian looks sexier , tastes superior , and feels so fine . Fortunately , some of that passion gets bottled for the rest of us to enjoy . Among wine pros , Italian wine is like golf : irresistible after the first taste but damned hard to master ( though it 's lots of fun to try ) . These numbers tell the story : dozens of unfamiliar terms-spumante , riserva , vigneto , collina , and so on ( all of them sound romantic and important , but only a few really matter to the buyer ) - 20 different wine regions , more than 250 different quality wine appellations , hundreds of indigenous grapes you 've never heard of , plus all the usual suspects , like chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon . All this can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not if you break it down the way I do . Then it 's as easy as uno , due , tre : There is one rule of thumb for buying and drinking Italian wine ( whether you 're in familiar territory like Chianti or trying something totally new ) ; there are two kinds of wine ; and there are three colors and key regions . UNO From clothes to cars to coffee , you probably already-or should-buy all your favorite Italian stuff by brand . A sound strategy , because whether it 's Illy for your espresso machine or Loro Piana for your custom suit , top brands guarantee signature style and a high-quality standard . Knowing your preferred specs ( grind , thread count , whatever ) allows you to buy virtually without thinking about it . You can look at Italian wine the same way-almost . There are a few big winery brands I could n't live without because you ca n't beat them for consistency and availability . These are the fail-safe names I rely on when I 'm buying for hotels : Antinori , Ruffino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve me well when I find myself in a place where choice is limited-at a supermarket or when I 'm dining with the aunts and uncles at a chain restaurant . But here 's what I mean by " almost " : Since the best Italian wines are artisanal products , limiting yourself to the big winery brands means you 're sure to miss out on some of the best Italy has to offer . And because the little guys do n't invest a lot in advertising and marketing , they can often deliver top quality at a lower price . So how do you find these little gems ? Look for the best importer names ( see " Names to Know , " left ) . Memorize a few of them so that when you 're scoping the Italian section of your liquor store , it 's just a matter of looking for the importer 's mark-usually a strip label adjacent to the main label . These specialty import companies comb the vinecloaked Italian countryside to source all the great small wineries , including the upand-comers , in much the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jordan . In addition to having a solid stable of wines from Italy 's classic regions , many of the best importers venture even farther afield to find worthy wines from less well known areas-and pass the savings on to you . DUE Wine snobs might accuse me of oversimplifying , but here goes : There really are just two kinds of Italian wine . With such an intense subject , I say the simpler , the better ; this is about enjoyment , not expertise . Once you break it down to a few basics , instead of feeling intimidation when confronted with the restaurant list or the wine-shop shelf , you 'll feel excitement about the possibilities .

In fact , to Italians , wine is food , as much a staple of the table as salt and pepper are in America . And Italians have a couple of ways of looking at eating . First , there 's fueling , which can be pleasant enough . Then there 's the " food experience , " and here everything 's important-from the company to the ambience to the plate itself . The same goes for Italian wine . For every day , there are literally hundreds of what I call vini bambini- " baby wines " - that are tasty , inexpensive , no-brainer choices you can enjoy often with whatever you 're eating . Finding them is easy . First , pick a price point , say ten dollars or less . Second , go with one of the big winery brands listed above , or any wine with one of my best-of importer labels . ( This works even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the label . ) Finally , pick a preferred style-lightto-medium , which is a good bet if you 're with people whose preferences you do n't know , or full-bodied if you like something more intense . If you prefer a light-to-medium body , go with the ones you 've heard of . For whites , that 's pinot grigio , Soave , Orvieto , Frascati . For reds , it 's Chianti , valpolicella , and anything from one of the three classic regions-Tuscany , Piedmont , and Veneto . All the familiar Italian wines are from central and northern Italy , where the everyday baby wines are n't full-bodied . If you 're partial to full-bodied wines , you can try anything else . This gets you a raft of fun wines from southern Italy , including Sicily and Sardinia . You might not have heard of the regions , wine types , or grapes , but so what ? Most wines from outside the classic zones are full-bodied , tasty , and cheap for two reasons : It 's hot there , and that gives you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the supply is abundant , which keeps prices low . When you 're neither fueling nor quaffing , you 'll want to look at the second type of Italian wine-a category I call the classics . Italians call them vini da meditazion ( meditation wines ) because at the very least they command your attention and may well blow your mind . The ones worth memorizing come from the classic zones , again , Tuscany , Piedmont , and Veneto . I 've arranged them by body style , roughly from lightest to fullest so you can match them with food of a similar weight ( that way , the wine does n't overpower the dish and vice versa ) . They are : Piedmont-Barbaresco and Barolo ( both from the Nebbiolo grape ) . Tuscany-Chianti classico and riserva , Vino Nobile , Brunello . Veneto-Amarone . All of these classics are red , which brings us to our final handy tip . TRE Included in the three colors of Italian wine is , of course , white , but overall , the Italians do n't really take white wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holidays , when some pink ( rosato ) might be thrown in for the refreshing chill . Most of the bianco they export to us for quaffing . Nothing wrong with thatjust do n't expect a meditative experience ( see " Vini Bambini , " page 55 ) . Okay , that 's more than enough info to make you maestro of your vino mondo , but do remember one final point : Italian wine is never meant to be a solo affair . In the true Italian style , it belongs to a trio that includes good food and good company . That part 's up to you .
