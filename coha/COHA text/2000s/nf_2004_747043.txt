ABSTRACT <p> This study examined whether and how self-efficacy to communicate with parents and peers about sex relate to sexually experienced adolescent males ' and females ' ( N = 144 , 112 ) condom attitudes , intentions , and use . Results showed that males who reported greater self-efficacy to communicate with parents used condoms more frequently ; and both males and females who can communicate with peers used condoms more frequently . Self-efficacy to communicate with peers was related to more positive condom attitudes , which in turn were associated with greater condom commitment and use . Greater ability to communicate with parents was also related to greater condom commitment and use among males . These results suggest the importance of designing interventions that give adolescents the skills they need to feel efficacious in their ability to communicate about sex and contraception . <p> The 2001 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey ( YRBS ) showed that nearly half of all high school students report a history of engaging in sexual intercourse ( 45.6% ) , with males reporting higher rates than females ( 48.5% and 42.9% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caucasian and Latino students ( 60.8% versus 43.2% and 48.4% , respectively ; CDC , 2002 ) . The primary risks involved in sexual behavior among adolescents are STDS , including HIV , and pregnancy , both of which are preventable through consistent and correct condom use . Although adolescents ' use of condoms has increased over the last decade , actual condom use is still inconsistent and less than optimal . Results from the 2001 YRBS indicate that among sexually active students , the prevalence of condom use , which was increasing throughout the 1990s , has leveled off since 1999 with no increase in condom use reported since that time . Condom use during last sexual intercourse was reported by 57.9% of students , with reported rates significantly lower for females ( 51.3% ) than for males ( 65.1% ; CDC , 2002 ) . Identifying factors that lead to increased condom use among sexually active adolescents is therefore paramount to reducing adolescents ' risk for STDs , HIV , and unplanned pregnancy . <p> A long-standing body of literature shows that adolescents who communicate with their parents about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than adolescents who do not have such conversations ( for a review of the literature , see Holtzman &; Robinson , 1995 ; Jacard &; Dittus , 1993 ) . Overall , the majority of research indicates that adolescents whose parents talk with them about sexual issues are more likely to delay sexual onset , and when sexually active , are more likely to use contraceptives , use condoms , and have fewer sexual partners than those adolescents for whom this communication does not occur ( Adolph , Ramos , Linton , &; Grimes , 1995 ; DiClemente , Wingood , Crosby , Cobb , Harrington , &; Davies , 2001 ; Fox &; Inazu , 1980 ; Holtzman &; Robinson , 1995 ; Hutchinson &; Cooney , 1998 ; Jaccard , Dittus , &; Gordon , 1996 ; Miller , Levin , Whitaker , &; Xu , 1998 ; Pick &; Palos , 1995 ; Whitaker &; Miller , 2000 ; Whitaker , Miller , May , &; Levin , 1999 ; Wilson , Kastrinakis , D'Angelo , &; Getson , 1994 ) . Parental comfort with the interaction ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discussions ( Jaccard &; Dittus , 1993 ; Miller , Kotchick , Dorsey , Forehand , &; Ham , 1998 ; Pistella &; Bonati , 1998 ) , and the frequency of communication ( Sigelman , Derenowski , Mullaney , &; Siders , 1993 ) have been shown to influence the effectiveness of such communication on adolescent sexual behavior . <p> Although the research base on peer communication and its relation to adolescent sexual behavior is more limited , there is evidence that adolescents ' perceptions that their peers support condom use is associated with more consistent condom use ( Boyer , Shafer , Wibbelsman , Seeberg , Teitle , &; Lovell , 2000 ; DiClemente , 1991 ; Romer , Black , Ricardo , &; Feigelman , 1994 ; Whitaker &; Miller , 2000 ) ; and the perception that peers are sexually active is linked to greater adolescent sexual activity ( Boyer et al. , 2000 ; Holtzman &; Robinson , 1995 ; Kinsman , Romer , Furstenberg , &; Schwartz , 1998 ; Romer et al. , 1994 ; Whitaker &; Miller , 2000 ) . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex partners are more likely to use condoms ( Crosby , DiClemente , Wingood , Cobb et al. , 2002 ; DiClemente , 1991 ; Shoop &; Davidson , 1994 ; Stone &; Ingham , 2002 ) . Therefore , it is reasonable to expect that conversations among adolescent peers about sex would also play a critical role in adolescent sexual risk behavior . <p> Very few studies have examined the simultaneous influence of parent and peer communication on adolescent sexual behavior . Holtzman and Robinson ( 1995 ) found that high school students who talked to their parents about HIV were less likely to have unprotected sex , while students who reported discussing HIV with peers were more likely to have unprotected sex . Gender differences emerged as well , with males more affected by conversations with peers and females more influenced by conversations with their parents . Furthermore , Whitaker and Miller ( 2000 ) found that for both engaging in sexual behavior and condom use , parental communication about sex and condoms moderated the peer norm-behavior relationship . Specifically , the relationship between perceived peer norms regarding sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condom use was stronger for those adolescents who had not discussed condoms or sex with a parent . These findings suggest that poor parent-adolescent communication regarding sexual issues may cause greater reliance on perceptions of peer norms as a guide to sexual behavior . Thus , there is a need to further explore the simultaneous and interactive relationship between peer and parent communication and the sexual behavior of adolescents . <p> While the aforementioned studies have explored the link between peer and parent communication and sexual behavior , to our knowledge no study has examined the role self-efficacy for communicating about sex with parents and peers plays in adolescent condom use . Self-efficacy , people 's beliefs about their capabilities to produce designated levels of performance , is thought to determine how people feel , think , motivate themselves , and behave ( Bandura , 1994 ) . If adolescents ' perceived ability to communicate with their parents and peers about sex plays a role in adolescent condom use , interventions targeting the ability to communicate with peers and parents regarding sexual issues may be warranted . Indeed , one study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gage , Jarvis , Mendoza , &; Parish , 1998 ) found that self-efficacy for communicating about safer sex influenced both actual sexual communication and perceived benefits of using condoms among adult female partners of men with HIV and hemophilia . <p> Further , studies have not explored how perceived ability to communicate about sex might influence adolescents ' condom use , and as such , the mechanism underlying this link remains unknown . Well-tested theoretical models of health behavior ( e.g. , The Theory of Reasoned Action and The Theory of Planned Behavior ; Ajzen &; Fishbein , 1980 ; Fishbein &; Ajzen , 1975 ) contend that a person 's intention to act on a behavior is the immediate determinant of that behavior . Behavioral intentions are proposed to be a function of a person 's attitude toward or evaluation of the behavior as well as his or her perceptions about what significant others think about that behavior . Using these models as a guiding framework , we were interested in examining whether and how perceived self-efficacy to communicate regarding sexual topics with parents and peers influences attitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual condom use . We hypothesized that adolescents ' reports of their ability to communicate with parents and peers about sex would be related to their attitudes about the use of condoms , which in turn would be related to an increased commitment or intention to use condoms as well as more frequent use of condoms . Because adolescent males and females differ in their rates of discussion about sexuality with their peers and their parents , and given that condom use is often not under the volitional control of the female , regardless of positive attitudes about and strong intentions to use condoms , we examined this model separately for male and female adolescents . METHODS <p> Study Participants <p> Participants were recruited from physical education classes in four urban academic high schools to participate in a longitudinal school-based STD and AIDS education and skills training program . Ninety-five percent of the students ( N = 813 ) provided written parental consent to participate in the study and completed the baseline questionnaire . Of these students , 256 ( 31% ) indicated that they have engaged in sexual intercourse as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you ever engaged in sexual intercourse ? " These sexually experienced adolescents comprised the study sample . Only data from the baseline survey are discussed in this study . <p> The sample was comprised of 144 male adolescents ( mean age = 15.40 years , SD = 1.10 ) and 112 female adolescents ( mean age = 15.35 years , SD = 1.12 ) , all of whom reported being sexually experienced . Participants were ethnically and racially diverse , including 4% Chinese , 9% Filipino , 29% Hispanic or Latino , 33% African-American , 9% Caucasian , 2% American Indian , and 14% multiethnic or other . <p> Procedures <p> One of the study investigators and four research assistants administered the anonymous , self-report , baseline questionnaire during physical education classes . The questionnaire took approximately 40 minutes to complete . <p> Measures <p> Perceived self-efficacy to communicate with parents about sex . A single item measured adolescents ' perceived ability to communicate with their parents about sex : " I could talk to my parents if I had a question or was concerned about sex . " Responses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Never " ( 0 ) to " Always " ( 4 ) . <p> Perceived self-efficacy to communicate with peers about sex . A single item measured adolescents ' perceived ability to communicate with their peers about sex : " I could talk to one of my friends if I had a question or was concerned about sex . " Responses were scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale , ranging from " Never " ( 0 ) to " Always " ( 4 ) . <p> Condom attitudes . Adolescents ' perceptions regarding the extent to which condoms are reliable , helpful , spoil the mood , and protect against STDs were measured using a 4-item scale , with responses scored on a 5-point Likert scale anchored by " Totally disagree " to " Totally agree . " Scores were reverse coded so that higher scores reflected more positive attitudes toward condom use ( Cronbach 's alpha = .58 ) . <p> Condom commitment . Four items were used to assess adolscents ' intentions to talk to their partner about using condoms , insist that a condom be used , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condom . Responses were scored on a 5-point scale , with higher scores reflecting a greater commitment to condom practices ( Cronbach 's alpha = .85 ) . <p> Condom use . Adolescents ' condom use was measured using a single item : how often the adolescent or his or her partner used condoms when engaging in sexual intercourse . This item was scored on a 5-point Likert-scale , from ' lever " ( 0 ) to " Always " ( 4 ) . RESULTS <p> Descriptive Statistics on Model Variables <p> Table 1 displays the means and standard deviations for each of the study variables for males and females separately ; and t-tests identify gender differences on these variables . As can be seen in the table , males reported greater self-efficacy for communicating with their parents about sex than did females ( t = 1.70 , p &lt; .10 ) ; while females reported greater self-efficacy for communicating with friends about sex than did males ( t = 4.43 , p &lt; .001 ) . The mean level of condom use was 2.77 ( SD = 1.55 ) for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eighteen percent of males and 31% of females reported never using a condom , whereas 52% of males and 32% of females reported always using condoms . T-tests indicated that males reported more consistent condom use than did females ( t = 3.05 , p &lt; .01 ) . No gender differences were found for condom attitudes or condom commitment . <p> Correlations Between Model Variables <p> Table 2 presents correlations between the model variables , for males and females separately . These correlations indicate a significant bivariate relationship between male adolescents ' reports that they can communicate with their parents about sex and their condom commitment ( r = .23 , p &lt; .05 ) . Further , self-efficacy for parent communication about sex was positively related to adolescent males ' condom use ( r = .19 , p &lt; .05 ) . No such relationships were found for the adolescent females . Peer communication self-efficacy was not directly related to condom use for either males or females . However , peer communication self-efficacy was positively related to adolescent males ' and females ' attitudes toward condom use ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's &lt; .05 ) . As expected , for both males and females , condom attitudes and commitment were significantly positively related , as were condom commitment and use . <p> Test of the Hypothesized Model <p> Path analysis was used to examine the predicted relations among the study constructs as described in the hypothesized model . In path analysis , a series of ordinary least squares regression equations are calculated . First , condom attitudes were regressed on parent and peer communication . In the second equation , condom commitment was regressed on condom attitudes and parent and peer communication . In the final equation , condom use was regressed on all previous variables in the model . Since race/ethnicity was not related to condom use nor did the pattern of results vary by racial group , race/ethnicity was not included as a variable in the equations . All analyses were conducted separately for males and females . Results are illustrated in Figure 1a ( males ) and Figure 1b ( females ) . <p> Adolescent males and females who reported being able to communicate with their peers about sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These attitudes in turn were positively associated with their commitment to use condoms , which was then related to their condom use ( male partner use ) . In addition , adolescent males who reported being able to talk to their parents about sex were more committed to using condoms than were adolescent males with less positive beliefs in their ability to communicate with their parents about sex . No relationship between communication self-efficacy with parents and the other model variables was found for the females . The model accounted for 48% and 28% of the variance in sexually experienced male and female adolescents ' condom use , respectively ( Fs = 23.38 and 8.86 , p 's &lt; .001 ) . DISCUSSION <p> This study examined how perceived self-efficacy to communicate about sex with parents and peers relates to sexually experienced adolescents ' condom use . It was hypothesized that an adolescent 's perceived self-efficacy to communicate with parents and peers about sex would be related to his or her attitudes about the use of condoms , which in turn would be related to an increased intention to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge , this is the first study to examine self-efficacy to communicate with parents and friends , rather than communication with sex partners or qualities of communication with parents or peers , and to begin to identify a process by which such communication might influence condom use . <p> Our findings demonstrate that , among adolescents who are already having sex , those who report being able to discuss sex are more likely to have safer sex . Specifically , reports of being able to communicate with peers about sex appear to play a role in sexually experienced adolescent males ' and females ' condom use , and the ability to communicate with parents about these issues seems also to be important for sexually experienced adolescent males ' condom use . Contrary to previous belief ( Coleman , 1961 ) , these results indicate that peer relations have a potential positive rather than a detrimental effect on adolescent behavior . These study results are in contrast to those of Holtzman and Rubinson ( 1995 ) in two important ways . First , they found that males were more influenced by conversations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for females . Second , they found conversations with peers to be related to more rather than less risky sexual behavior . There are several explanations as to why the results may have differed . First , Holtzman and Robinson included both sexually experienced and nonsexually experienced adolescents . Second , their study focused on communication about AIDS or HIV infection specifically , whereas the present study asked about the ability to talk to parents and peers about sex in general . Finally , the adolescents in our study reported being able to talk to their peers about sex more often than to their parents , with males reporting greater self-efficacy communicating with parents than did females , and females reporting greater self-efficacy in communicating with peers than did males . In the Holtzman and Rubinson study , adolescents talked with their parents more than peers , with no reported gender differences . <p> As expected , the relationships between communication self-efficacy and condom use were complicated and indirect , via adolescents ' attitudes toward and intentions to use condoms . For both males and females , a greater ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , self-efficacy in communicating with parents regarding sex was related to males ' commitment to use condoms . Further , consistent with the Theory of Reasoned Action and The Theory of Planned Behavior ( Ajzen &; Fishbein , 1980 ; Albarracin , Johnson , Fishbein , &; Muellerleile , 2001 ; Fishbein &; Ajzen , 1975 ) , positive attitudes toward condom use were related to condom commitment , which in turn was a strong proximal correlate of adolescent condom use for both males and females . <p> There are several study limitations that must be acknowledged before further discussing the study results . First , this study utilizes cross-sectional data and therefore can not address the causal relationship between communication , attitudes , commitment , and actual condom use . It is possible that adolescents , once they become sexually active and decide whether or not to use condoms , feel more comfortable communicating about sex and are more likely to seek information from their parents and peers . Alternatively , a greater ability to communicate with parents and peers about sex may truly have a positive influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second , this study assessed perceived self-efficacy to communicate with parents and friends about sex , but did not assess whether this was related to how often such communication actually occurs . Third , the question concerning parental communication used in this study did not elicit information regarding the ability to communicate with mothers and fathers separately . Such information would be important given that there is evidence that communication with parents varies not only by the sex of the adolescent ( Nolin &; Petersen , 1992 ) , but the sex of the parent ( Miller et al. , 1998 ; Noller &; Bagi , 1985 ) . Finally , only one item was used to assess parent and peer communication self-efficacy about sex . <p> Despite these limitations , this is one of the first studies to examine perceived self-efficacy to communicate with peers and to suggest a process by which such perceptions may be playing a role in adolescent condom use . The results of this research indicate that having perceptions of high self-efficacy to communicate with peers , and parents if male , may have a direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and commitment , on condom use . Furthermore , as the research previously described indicates , if actual communication with parents positively influences condom use and sexual behavior , then efforts to improve adolescents ' self-efficacy toward such communication are warranted . According to Bandura ( 1994 ) , the most effective way to build one 's self-efficacy for a behavior is through mastery experiences with the behavior . As such , having successful experiences in communicating with parents and peers about sex will build a strong perceived self-efficacy for such communication , which increases the chance that the adolescent will attempt such communication in the future . Adolescents who doubt their efficacy to communicate about sexual issues will expect themselves to fail at it , and will therefore be less likely to attempt to talk to peers or parents about sexual issues . <p> These findings suggest that efforts to enhance adolescents ' perceived self-efficacy to communicate about sexual issues with parents and peers may be helpful not only to improve communication , but to improve attitudes about , intentions to use , and actual use of condoms . Programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequency between parents and adolescents about sex have been described ( Anderson , Koniak-Griffin , Keenan , Uman , Duggal , Casey , 1999 ; Benshoff &; Alexander , 1993 ; Foulds , 1990 ; Jorgensen , Potts , &; Camp , 1993 ; Oliver , Leeming , &; Dwyer , 1998 ; Snegroff , 1995 ) . One study , which looked at the effect of enhancing a school-based abstinence-only curriculum with parent-child communication homework assignments , found that participating adolescents reported greater comfort with , and increased frequency of , communication with their parent about sexual issues , and lower intention to have sex before completing high school than did those students who did not receive the communication homework assignments ( Blake , Simkin , Ledsky , Perkins , &; Calabrese , 2001 ) . Similar studies on how to enhance communication skills regarding sex with peers could not be found . However , as pointed out by Whitaker and Miller ( 2000 ) , adolescents who do not talk with their parents about sexual issues are less likely to believe their parents are the most useful source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow perceived peer norms to guide their sexual behavior . Improving self-efficacy to communicate with peers regarding sexual issues could help teens achieve a more realistic assessment of their peers ' sexual behaviors , rather than depending on perceived peer sexual norms , which can ultimately promote risky sexual behavior ( Holtzman &; Rubinson , 1995 ; Romer et al. , 1994 ) . <p> Programs , however , need to go beyond targeting the adolescent alone and consider the larger social context of adolescents . An adolescent 's perceptions of low self-efficacy may be warranted if prior attempts to communicate with parents or peers were negatively received . Enhancing parent and peer communication skills and/or guiding adolescents to other sources of sexual information as needed , such as health care provider , school counselor , or other adult relatives who may be more receptive , may be helpful for improving adolescents ' sexual knowledge and their self-efficacy for communicating about such issues in the future . <p> Prior to further development of such interventions , research is needed to identify the content and methods of parent and peer conversations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to address how parents and peers can best convey information in terms of content , process , and affect about sexual behavior , the use of contraception and/or condoms , the potential negative ( and positive ) consequences associated with adolescent sexual behavior , and strategies to reduce pregnancy and STDs . Finally , if adolescents are going to use condoms , they must also have perceptions of strong self-efficacy to talk to their sexual partners , insist that condoms be used , carry condoms with them , and to refuse to have sex if no condom is available . Overall , programs designed to decrease risky sexual behavior and prevent adolescent pregnancy , STDs , and HIV should strive to give adolescents the skills they need to feel efficacious in their ability to communicate about sex and contraception with adults , peers , and potential sex partners , as well as to provide the knowledge needed to make informed sexual decisions . <p> This research was supported by the Centers for Disease Control ( Grant No .
