Chapter One " I 'm going crazy , " Mala murmured . Jumping to her feet , she strode to the plate glass window overlooking the pristine city surrounding her town house . The planet Nerak , where the light never faded and everything was white . So horribly white-colorless , stark and cold . Just like everything on her planet . " Would you like a hormone smoothie ? " Barton asked over the monitoring system . She stuck her tongue out . " No , I would n't like a smoothie . " A small aero unit whizzed past , rattling her window . Everything moved too fast . Instant gratification . Sad ? Drink a happy smoothie . Tired ? Drink an energy smoothie . Horny ? Drink a hormone smoothie . Everything was a quick fix . " You get this way every year . I 'm only suggesting a smoothie because it usually calms you . " She cocked an eyebrow . " Maybe because it has a sedative in it ? " " We could copulate . " A door that blended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barton stepped inside the room . He was like no other . Six feet , three inches of rugged , sexy male . Blond hair , blue eyes ... she should be happy . She should . Should n't she ? Then why was she so frustrated ? " It 's been three years , twenty-one days , fourteen hours , twenty-two minutes and nine seconds since you 've had an orgasm , " he informed her . And he was driving her crazy . She did n't want perfection , but Barton was exactly the way she 'd ordered him . A gift from her cousin on Mala 's twenty-first birthday . Together they had chosen everything about him . He was their creation . At the time , her older cousin , Kia , had been going through a rebellious period and had smuggled a catalog of male specimens into Mala 's apartment . Barton was born from a sketch they 'd compiled . But they had taken their creation a step further . They 'd practically breathed life into him . At least , as much life as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the emotions of any Nerakian . He was the perfect male . He was still perfect five years later . Everything about her life was perfect . She hated it . " You 're grinding your teeth again . I take it sex is not an option . " " No , sex is not an option . " She turned back to the window . " Ahh . " " Ahh , what ? " she asked without turning around . " You 've been looking at that book again . " She stiffened , then quickly relaxed her shoulders . " What book ? " That was the most un-innocent sounding question she 'd ever asked . " You 're being evasive , are n't you ? You know perfectly well what book I mean . The one from your grandmother 's travels . The one about that other place ... Earth . " Why had she even thought she could fool him ? He 'd been around her too long . There was nothing she could hide . So why did she even try ? She might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes narrowed as she faced him . " You swear on the promise stones that you wo n't say a word ? Even if they threaten to remove your microchip ? " His chin jutted forward . " Have I ever betrayed you ? " " Sorry . " Damn , she had to remember that Barton was special . Although very analytical , he still had feelings . She 'd made sure of that even though her cousin had warned against adding the sensitivity chip ... among others . But she did n't want just a companion unit . She had to have more than a machine . Well , she 'd certainly gotten more than she bargained for with Barton . She went to the bookcase and pulled three reference books from the shelf and reached to the back of the case , pushing a hidden button . Her fingers tingled when they brushed over the book-her grandmother 's diary , and even more precious ... the film . She glanced behind her before bringing them out . " Hide the window . " Barton waved a hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only then did she bring the materials out . " Do you realize how much trouble you can get into by just having these documents ? " " Of course I do , " she told him as she carried everything to the lounging sofa . " They barred distant travel after my grandmother 's last voyage-the year I was born . They said our society was being tarnished by the ideas that were brought back . " You do realize the Coalition is looking out for your best interests . From the small amount of information on space travel that I have programmed into my system , Earth is by far the most untamable . " " But do n't you see , that 's what makes it so exciting . People can actually think for themselves . They do n't have a Coalition of Elders telling them what 's in their best interest . They 're allowed to make their own mistakes . They can grow and learn from them . " She placed the film in the change port . A hologram filled the room with sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees , could almost feel the spray from the waterfall as it cascaded over the mountain and splashed down into the pond . She inhaled . " I wonder what it smells like on Earth ? " " Earthy ? " She frowned at Barton before letting the unfolding scenes capture her attention once more . The hologram was n't much different than the ones she inserted into the port when she wanted to go to a park or just get away from the noise inside the town bubble . This hologram really existed . That was the difference . Her grandmother had labeled the documentary an XXX-rated Western movie . Whatever that meant . Not that it mattered that much . This was her proof there was more in the universe than Nerak . There was even a title on the box : Callie Does The Sheriff . She wished her grandmother had explained more instead of leaving so many unanswered questions . She returned her attention to the waterfall . The woman washed herself beneath the spray of water , her thin pink dress transparent as she slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression on the woman 's face , the sensation must have been enjoyable . Her grandmother 's journal had described something similar and called it bathing . She said it was a barbaric custom Earth people did to cleanse their bodies . How odd they had to run a white brick over their body . Every morning , Mala went to the chamber , waved her hand and beams of light rid her body of bacteria . But the woman did seem excited . For a moment , she wished she had a white brick to rub over her body . It looked much more enjoyable than beams of light she never felt . Sighing , she watched what happened next , even though she 'd secretly watched the film before . The woman had n't seen the man yet . When she turned from the waterfall , her pupils dilated . The man sat atop a four-legged beast , gazing upon her , but there was something in his eyes that made Mala 's thighs tremble . It was as if no one else existed for him . He climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his shirt sparkled in the sunlight . She held her breath , watching his face and the lazy look he gave her before he sat on a rock and pulled off his boots . " Sheriff , what are you doing ? " The woman 's voice trembled . " What I should 've done a long time ago , Callie May . " He removed his clothes before stepping into the water , every inch of his backside displayed for Mala 's enjoyment . Muscles rippled as he waded farther out , then dove beneath the murky green water . When Sheriff emerged , he was beside Callie May , taking her into his arms , lowering his mouth to hers . He moved his hand to her breast , massaging . Mala could barely swallow , let alone breathe , her gaze riveted on the couple . Sheriff tugged the front of Callie 's dress and it opened . " I want to see you , darlin ' . You 've been teasin ' me for a long time . " " But we 're out in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide , but Mala did n't think she looked that upset . " What if someone sees ? " she said in a breathless voice . " I do n't care . " He cupped her breast before lowering his head and covering it with his mouth . He suckled for a moment , then raised his head . " I 'm going to make love to you , baby . The hot , dirty kind . You ai n't never had an orgasm like you 're gon na have with me . " " Is n't he magnificent ? " Mala breathed . " This was what I was designed from ? He seems rather savage if you ask me . " Barton sniffed . Sometimes she wanted to remove Barton 's sensitivity chip . She turned off the hologram . " It 's a primitive planet . I 've read my grandmother 's journal . The beast the man sat upon is a horse . " She frowned . " Or maybe a cow . I 'm not quite sure . Her journals are a little difficult to translate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of information . Her time on the planet was very brief . " " And the couple in the hologram ? They were about to copulate ? " " I 'm not sure . I think so . " She bit her bottom lip . " Yes , I 'm almost certain of it . Some of the film was damaged so I 'm not positive how their encounter ended . I think they joined , but it was more intense than just copulating , more going on than relieving stress . " " Would you like me to do what Sheriff did ? I can , you know . " How did she tell him something would be lost in the process ? She did n't want to join for the sake of release . She wanted someone who would ... who would make love to her . Was that asking too much ? " Why are you so fascinated with Earth ? " He changed the subject . " It 's not like you 'll ever go there . " A half smile played around her lips . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains all the information I would need to survive . " She took a deep breath . " I know where they store the space travel crafts . " " Those old scraps of metal ? I doubt you 'd be able to get one of them out of its port . " His beautiful blue eyes grew round . " You do n't actually plan ... " " Yes ! " She flung her arms wide and twirled around the room . " Barton , I do n't belong here . I want to experience life , not watch it on a hologram . I want to know what dirt feels like . I want to walk barefoot through a meadow . I want to stand beneath a waterfall . " " But you can do that now . " " No , a hologram is n't the same . I do n't want to find myself transported to a make-believe park . I want the real thing . " " But with reality comes other things-like pain . There are no thorns to step upon in the Coalition 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt . It 's perfect . " She plopped down on the lounging sofa and drew her knees up . " Do n't you see ? I do n't want perfection . I want to experience everything . " " I ... see . " Now she 'd hurt his feelings . Barton had been programmed to see to her every need . There were no men left on her planet . He was the perfect male specimen . " You 're my friend , " she told him . " But I need more . Please try to understand that it 's not you . It 's me . " He raised his chin . " When are we making the journey ? " She flinched . This was the hard part , but she could n't risk putting him in danger . " Just me . I wo n't take a chance with you . " When he opened his mouth , she hurried on . " Besides , the Coalition wo n't even realize I 'm gone if you 're here . I just want to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer than a few rotations . " He hesitated . " You 'll swear on the promise stones ? " " I 'll swear . " " I still do n't like it . They may be closer to us in language and atmosphere , but their culture is so far behind ours . How will you manage ? " " Grandmother 's book . " She raised the journal . " I 've studied it very carefully . I know their favorite saying is , well , hell , and that it 's early summer on the planet . I have everything I need right here . " She tapped her finger on the book . What she was about to embark on finally sunk into her brain . She was going to Earth . A slow smile curved her lips . Maybe she 'd even meet the man in the hologram . The one called Sheriff . * * * Earth ! It was beautiful . A big round ... ball . Much bigger than she 'd expected . A lot bigger than Nerak . Her planet was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth sparkled . Mala sighed with utter joy and tried to focus , but it was n't that easy . She was here-at least , almost . Her palms began to sweat . Her heart beat faster . This was it , and the most important part so she had to stay calm . The craft began to shake as she entered the atmospheric pull . Her grandmother had n't mentioned such violent movement , but then , the craft had n't been nearly as old , either . " Please do n't fall apart , " she breathed , grasping the guidance bar and manually steering the craft . She would be fine . She was almost positive . Her coordinates were exactly with her grandmother's-sort of . She pointed the craft toward Earth . It plunged downward . Here I go ! The blue sky filled her glass shield . She was moving faster than she could maneuver the small ship . Mountains whizzed past with her barely having time to get out of the way . " Tree ! " She dodged it ; limbs slapped the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the right , then the left . Oh , no , this was n't good . Things were moving way too fast ! Bam ! Her head rammed against the craft 's guidance panel as the craft jerked and bumped to a grinding stop . Dry , powdery dust swirled behind Mason McKinley 's Jeep like a small tornado in the fading light of day . If they did n't get some rain soon , his small ranch would dry up and blow away . He glanced upward . Not a dark cloud in the sky . He wished he could say the same about his life . Too many complications . He stopped in front of his modest log home and killed the engine , slipping the keys into his jeans pocket as he climbed out and started toward the house . His dog , Blue , jumped out of the open back and took off at a run chasing an imaginary jackrabbit . Good old Blue . He shook his head . The dog would n't know what to do if he ever caught a rabbit . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot on the bottom step , knowing the dispatcher at the office was about to speak . " Sheriff , we have a situation . " Francine 's new word this week-situation . Everything was a situation . He removed his Stetson and ran a weary hand through his hair before taking the radio out of the leather holster and keying the mike . " What kind of situation ? " " Harlan says he saw a flying saucer . " He gritted his teeth and counted to ten . If Harlan did n't stop this nonsense , he was going to lock him up for disturbing the peace-namely his . Mason 's gaze shot toward the town he 'd just left . The reporters from The National Gossip were still at the motel . Somehow , Harlan had convinced them Bigfoot roamed the surrounding woods . Bigfoot , of all things ! How could anyone actually believe that kind of nonsense ? Now there were about three reporters wandering around their small Texas town in search of anything they could claim was the mythical beast . They were n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in it to make a buck , but all they 'd accomplished was pissing off a lot of people who in turn kept the phone lines to his office lit up . Jimmy Wilson said some idiot was snapping pictures of his Braham Bull . Mason shook his head . Old Red was the meanest bull in the county . The reporter was lucky to get back across the fence before the angry animal trampled him . His radio crackled again . " Sheriff , he said it was on the north side of your property . Close to the highway . Said there was a bright light-like maybe it crashed . " He keyed the radio again . " It was probably one of the big rigs going around Devils Curve . You know when it gets close to dusk the lights flicker about . People have been reporting spaceships for years now . " " You want me to tell him that ? " Harlan would n't give him any peace until he checked it out . Damn , how the hell had his life become so problematic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ridden Dancer in a couple of days . The ride would do them both good and he still had a couple of hours before it got good and dark . " Tell him I 'll check it out . " " Ow ! " Mala 's head pounded horribly . Was this what physical pain felt like ? She was n't sure she liked it . In fact , she was positive she did n't like it . Tentatively , she reached up and lightly touched her forehead . Her finger came away wet ... and tinged red . Oh , no , she was starting the deep sleep cycle , her lifeblood draining from her body . Her bottom lip trembled . Not before she set foot on Earth . She 'd at least have that much before the air left her body . Except the door did n't open when she stood in front of it and waved her arm . She manually pushed on the button . Nothing . Not even a little squeak . It did n't budge . Now what ? She did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface . That would n't be fair at all . (
