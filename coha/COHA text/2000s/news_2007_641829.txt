<p> Who would n't jump at the chance to hang out on the set of the Eddie Murphy " NowhereLand " movie shooting here and see what the actors eat , maybe get a glimpse of Eddie himself ? <p> When the Chef Robrt Catering staff invited me to tour their trailer , I thought " Jeez , what a pretentious showbiz name . " Then I thought , " Well , maybe he 's French . " <p> But when Robrt Lamkin answered his cellphone , he sure did n't sound French . But the fact that he answered his own phone seemed like a good sign . <p> And when I got to the set just north of the Downtown Aquarium , he was cooking his own food , another good sign . <p> Robrt runs this movie-catering operation from a 35-foot RV , a double grill/trailer and a truck with a built-in , walk-in fridge . It 's like the ultimate covered wagon , complete with three convection ovens , a six-burner stove with a grill and a 20-gallon coffee urn . One of seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plus $75,000 in extra gear , and the support truck , about $150,000 . <p> " It 's a nomadic life , " says the chef as he cuts limes for mango chutney . " We 've gone from the edge of the Grand Canyon to the Golden Gate Bridge to the Little Bighorn . If they 're filming , we 're wrangling food . " <p> He got his start in movie catering on " Dances With Wolves , " where he also earned his Frenchy-sounding nickname . " I was talking on the radio in a cheesy French accent . Kevin Costner heard me , and he and the crew started calling me ' Ro-bear , ' and it stuck . " <p> Somehow , it does n't sound like name-dropping when he tells the story . <p> Robrt 's been feeding actors for 18 years , and he 's used to special requests . He 's flown into locations everything from New York steaks to a sushi chef , but he does n't see his clients as spoiled divas , rather as hardworking executives who want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film like this , you have to handle every curve ball and still keep the actors and producers happy , " he says , neatly separating lime segments . " You have to be able to make everything from exotic fare to white-trash grilled cheese . " <p> He wo n't say who wanted the " white-trash " food but , when pushed for names , tells how Kevin Kline would come into the trailer and " chop ground beef at the grill with me . " And Keanu Reeves , notoriously careful about what he eats , " has a terrible weakness for my semisweet chocolate walnut cookies . " <p> On this movie , starring Eddie Murphy as a distracted executive whose daughter 's imaginary world holds the answers to his troubles , Robrt and his seven- <p> person crew will feed about 350 people twice a day while filming in Denver through Friday . <p> " Typically , actors and actresses eat when the crew eats , " he says , still working his way through a giant bag of limes . " It is odd when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but what 's remarkable is their normalcy . " <p> As if on cue , Murphy strolls past the buffet line , inspecting the veggie burgers . Acting cool , I say , " Oh wow , that 's Eddie ! " His knife still slicing through lime segments , Robrt glances over and says , " Nah , that 's his stand-in . " <p> I ca n't take my eyes off the man who looks like , well , Eddie Murphy 's double . Exactly like him - buff in a skin-tight turtleneck and black skullcap . <p> Murphy usually sends his assistant 's assistant over for food , preferring to stick close to the set , Robrt 's business partner , Ray Bidenost , tells me . That 's right , his assistant 's assistant . <p> Producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura has worked with Chef Robrt Catering since producing his first movie in 2004 , and through shooting " Transformers " in 2006 . " As a producer , my first production , ' Constantine , ' had Chef Robrt on it because I knew that a well-fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an e-mail to The Post . " Plus Robrt 's cookies are in life 's greatest treats category . He should franchise them . " <p> During the " Transformers " shoot at Holloman Air Force Base in southern New Mexico , the company flew specialty meats and fish into El Paso , Texas , and a member of the catering crew drove the 180-mile round trip to retrieve them . <p> Excessive ? Not in Robrt 's book . He 's been on many locations in the middle of nowhere . " Food is actually critical . More often than not , you 're the best restaurant in town . " <p> Robrt counts on executive chef Brad Combs to keep his wagon running smoothly . Combs works his culinary network to bring in as many local ingredients - and helpers - as possible . Today , two Johnson and Wales University students , Jeremy Cartwright and Erin Higgins , help the crew of six feed 340 people . <p> And that 's nothing . Once , in San Francisco , the company was set to feed 3,000 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and defrosted chicken cutlets , and nobody had any idea that was n't part of the plan . <p> This night , the cast and crew and extras will dine on slow-roasted lamb with red curry sauce and the mango chutney Robrt 's been working on all morning . <p> " If we walk on set , we 're celebrities in our own right , " he says . We did n't get to put that statement to the test , as Robrt got word that shooting would finish an hour early , so he would have to have dinner ready early as well . At the other location , the Belmar ice rink in Lakewood . No one complains as they pack up the entire operation and double-wrap the huge bowl of mangoes and lime segments . <p> " This pays quite well - you can work nine months and then have three months off . A chef can make comfortably over $100,000 a year , " says Robrt .

We do this for the love of food , and for someone to smile and say ' How did you make this ?
