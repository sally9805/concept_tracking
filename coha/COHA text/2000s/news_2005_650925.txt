<p> PRESIDENT BUSH 's choice to succeed Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board has raised a roar of approval . Economist , scholar , presidential counselor and former Fed governor , Ben S. Bernanke is a nominee from central casting . <p> But there is one rub . The man with the gray beard and the perfect resume  --  winner of the South Carolina state spelling bee , Ph.D . from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , former chairman of the Princeton economics department  --  professes to believe the impossible . He insists that the Fed can keep the economy chugging and prices stable just by pushing a single interest rate ( the so-called federal funds rate ) up and down . <p> Alan Greenspan , of course , has long espoused the same impossibility , as have other Federal Reserve officials and many private economists . A little thought experiment will reveal their error . <p> Let us say that Mr. Bernanke 's field of expertise was energy prices rather than interest rates , and that the president named him to the Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ventured a long-term oil-price forecast , would anyone even bother to write it down ? Would anyone expect him , once confirmed , to actually fix the price ? <p> Those who did would have to call the idea by its discredited name  --  price controls  --  and would have to explain why the secretary-designate knew better than the market at which price the supply of oil would meet the demand for oil . They would also have to explain why this episode in price controls would turn out better than the long series of flops that preceded it . The world would laugh . <p> Yet we seem to accept , and even desire , exactly such ludicrous claims of foresight from a Fed chairman . It follows that anyone who is willing to take the job as Fed chief is , by that reason , unqualified to hold it . <p> Wall Street , of course , has other ideas . Thus the rally in stock prices following word of Mr. Bernanke 's nomination was no vote of confidence that the presumptive chairman would settle on the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather , an expression of hope that he would do his all to ensure a speculatively appropriate ( meaning very , very low ) rate . <p> Perhaps . But Mr. Bernanke 's history shows he is not so much a believer in easy money as in the capacity of the Fed to take the right anticipatory action . Is the rate of inflation too high ? Not high enough ? With a twist of the monetary-policy dial , the problem is on its way to being solved . Let the Fed announce its target for inflation  --  say , 2 percent a year  --  and juggle its interest rate to cause that desired inflation rate to materialize . In so many words , the nominee contends , policymakers control events , rather than the other way around . <p> We are all susceptible to believing an impossible thing . Mr. Bernanke has the special susceptibility of the straight-A student . The economic world he sees is his to command . He can comprehend it , even measure it ( no small achievement given the subjective , even arbitrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expresses his supreme self-confidence in some of the bluntest language ever spoken by a central banker . <p> Late in 2002 , the Fed started to warn against the risk of deflation , that is , of broadly falling prices . Now , deflation is no bad thing if you find yourself at the cash register with a shopping cart full of groceries . But Mr. Bernanke did not have the shopper exclusively in mind . " When inflation is already low and the fundamentals of the economy suddenly deteriorate , " he said in a speech that November , " the central bank should act more pre-emptively and more aggressively than usual in cutting rates . " <p> Some modicum of inflation is a must , he said . Let prices start to sag , and they could go right on sagging , as they had done in Japan for years . The solution : print money . The counterarguments for sitting tight ( Are not falling prices a natural and , on balance , benign consequence of the incorporation of China and India into the global economy ? By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would n't the Fed distort a whole host of prices and interest rates ? ) found no sympathy with him or Mr. Greenspan . <p> So Mr. Bernanke , then one of seven Federal Reserve governors , sought to assure the world that United States monetary policy would stop deflation before it started . Yet here was a tricky assignment , for the post-1971 dollar is purely faith-based . Not since the Nixon years has a holder of dollars had the privilege of exchanging them for a statutory weight of gold . Rather , the dollar is a piece of paper , or electronic impulse , of no intrinsic value . It is legal tender whose value is ultimately determined by the confidence of the people who hold it . <p> In the Greenspan era , the United States became an immense net debtor . A prudent American central banker , it might seem , would therefore be at pains to spare these overseas accumulators of greenbacks any unnecessary anxiety about inflation damaging the shelf life of their money . Not Mr. Bernanke . In that 2002 speech , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government can ( and in certain circumstances should ) print up as much of it as it wants . And it should not be stymied in the work of restoring the rate of inflation to a decent minimum even if interest rates fell to zero . <p> The Fed could , if necessary , buy up all the Treasury 's debt , using dollars created specially for the purpose . Or , for a double-barrel stimulus , it could also buy up private debts ( mortgages , car loans , bonds and the like ) . And as a last resort , the Fed could figuratively put in place an idea that the economist Milton Friedman once theorized for illustrative purposes : It could drop money out of helicopters . Approbation for Mr. Bernanke is not quite universal on Wall Street ; after that speech some took to mockingly calling him " Helicopter Ben . " <p> Many were the blessings , real and imagined , of the Greenspan era : low inflation , falling interest rates in a growing economy , a pair of notably mild recessions and a succession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Reserve . Stock prices were bubbly ( until the bubble burst ) , and Wall Street prospered . But debt grew and grew , and the gulf between what the United States consumes and what it produces  --  the trade deficit  --  widened to break all records . <p> Now Mr. Bernanke stands to inherit what Mr. Greenspan and he , among others at the Fed , wrought . Certainly they have whipped deflation . But by pressing down interest rates to the floor , they have pushed housing prices to the sky . And they are the uneasy witnesses to an unscripted climb in the Consumer Price Index , which , in September , registered a 4.7 percent increase over last year . <p> Do n't worry , many counsel . The seemingly alarming inflation data are the statistical tracks of a boom in energy prices caused by the Iraq war and the Gulf Coast hurricanes . It will pass . <p> But what if it does n't ? What if a new cycle of rising prices has already begun  --  as I happen to believe it has ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the future , wo n't soon be changing the way the Fed operates . Rather , it will be the world 's dollar holders who will change the way they operate . <p> If America 's creditors sense that inflation is robbing them of their wealth and that the Bernanke Fed is too slow to raise its interest rate , they will sell their dollars and dollar-denominated securities . Such an exodus would , among other things , tend to increase the costs of imported goods and drive up dollar-denominated interest rates . In other words , events would control the Fed . <p> Since each of the world 's major currencies is a scrap of paper of no intrinsic value , some of these disaffected dollar investors may buy gold . Mr. Bernanke does n't talk much about that barbarous relic . What would he make of a flight from a rationally managed currency into an inert precious metal ? I will guess that it would astonish him . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
