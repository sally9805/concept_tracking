Chapter One Bergdorf Blondes are a thing , you know , a New York craze . Absolutely everyone wants to be one , but it 's actually trs difficult . You would n't believe the dedication it takes to be a gorgeous , flaxen-haired , dermatologically perfect New York girl with a life that 's fabulous beyond belief . Honestly , it all requires a level of commitment comparable to , say , learning Hebrew or quitting cigarettes . Getting the hair color right is murder , for a start . It all began with my best friend , Julie Bergdorf . She 's the ultimate New York girl , since glamorous , thin , blonde department-store heiresses are the chicest thing to be here . Someone heard she 'd been going to Ariette at Bergdorf for her color since high school , because apparently she told her personal shopper at Calvin Klein who told all her clients . Anyway , it was rumored in certain circles that Julie got her blonde touched up every thirteen days exactly and suddenly everyone else wanted to be Thirteen-Day Blondes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very white , like Carolyn Bessette Kennedy 's was . She 's the icon , the hair to worship . It 's beyond expensive . Ariette is like $450 a highlight , if you can get in with her , which obviously you ca n't . Inevitably , Bergdorf Blondes are talked and gossiped about endlessly . Every time you open a magazine or newspaper there 's another item about a BB 's latest romantic drama or new obsession ( right now it 's fringed Missoni dresses ) . But sometimes gossip is by far the most reliable source of information about yourself and all your friends , especially in Manhattan . I always say why trust myself when gossip can tell moi the real truth about moi ? Anyway , according to gossip I 'm this champagne bubble of a girl about town - New York being the only town that cares about having girls about it - living the perfect party-girl life , if that 's what you think a perfect life is . I never tell a soul this , but sometimes before the parties I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are straight out of a movie like Fargo . I 've heard that almost all Manhattan girls suffer from this debilitating condition . They never admit it either . Julie gets the Fargos so badly that she 's never able to leave her apartment in The Pierre in time for anything she has to be in time for . Everyone thinks the party-girl life is the best life you can lead here . The truth is that combined with work it 's completely draining , but no one dares say that in case they look ungrateful . All anyone in New York ever says is " everything 's fabulous ! " even if they 're on Zoloft for depression . Still , there are plenty of upsides . Like , you never have to pay for anything important like manis or pedis or highlights or blow-outs . The downside is that sometimes the freebies wreak havoc with your social life - believe me , if your dermatologist 's kid ca n't get into Episcopal he 'll be on the phone to you day and night . To be specific , last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sixty-third and Madison for her " super-duper-casual baby shower . Just the girls getting together , " she 'd said . There were three staff per guest , handmade pink cookies from Payard Patisserie on Lexington , and chocolate booties from Fauchon . It was about as casual as the inauguration . No one ate a thing , which is standard protocol at Upper East Side baby showers . I 'd just walked through the door when my cell rang . " Hello ? " I said . " You need highlights ! " yelled a desperate voice . It was George , my hairdresser . I use George when I ca n't get in with Ariette which is almost all the time because she 's permanently booked with Julie . " Are you in Arizona ? " I asked . ( " Arizona " is what everyone says instead of " rehab . " A lot of hairdressers in New York visit Arizona almost every month . ) " Just back , " he replied . " If you do n't go blonde you are going to be a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd think George , being a hairdresser , would know this already , I explained that a brunette like me ca n't go blonde . " Can in New York , " he said , choking up . I ended up spending the present-opening ceremony in Mimi 's library discussing addictive personality types with George and hearing all the one-liners he 'd picked up in rehab , like " Say what you mean and mean what you say and do n't be mean when you say it . " Every time George goes into rehab he starts talking more and more like the Dalai Lama . Personally I think if hairdressers are going to offer deep insights they should be exclusively on the subject of hair . Anyway , no one thought George 's behavior was odd because everyone in New York takes calls from their beauty experts at social occasions . It was lucky I was out of the room when Mimi opened my gift , which was a library of Beatrix Potter books . She totally freaked because it was more books than she 'd ever read . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than controversial literature at baby showers . Sometimes the hairdressers and their addictions and the parties and the blow-outs take up so much time it starts to feel like work and you ca n't focus on your real career . ( And I do have a real career to think about-more of which later . ) But that 's what happens in Manhattan . Everything just kind of creeps up on you , and before you know it you 're out every night , working like crazy and secretly waxing the hair on the inside of your nose like everyone else . It 's not long before you start thinking that if you do n't do the nose-hair-wax thing your whole world 's going to fall apart . Before I give you the rest of the goss from Mimi 's shower , here are a few character traits you might want to know about me : 1 . Fluent in French , intermittently . I 'm really good at words like moi and trs , which seem to take care of just about everything a girl needs . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me exactly fluent , but I say , well , that 's lucky because if I spoke perfect fluent French no one would like me , and no one likes a perfect girl , do they ? 2 . Always concerned for others ' well-being . I mean , if a friendly billionaire offers you a ride from New York to Paris on his PJ ( that 's a quick NY way of saying private jet ) , one is morally bound to say yes , because that means the person you would have been sitting next to on the commercial flight now has two seats to themself , which is a real luxury for them . And when you get tired you can go sleep in the bedroom , whereas however hard I look I have never found a bedroom on an American Airlines 767 . If someone else 's comfort is at stake , I say , always take the private jet . 3 . Tolerant . If a girl is wearing last season 's Manolo Blahnik stilettos , I wo n't immediately rule her out as a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person is lurking in a past-it pair of shoes . ( Some girls in New York are so ruthless they wo n't speak to a girl unless she 's in next season 's shoes , which is really asking a lot. ) 4 . Common sense . I really am fluent in it . You 've got to recognize it when a day is a total waste of makeup . 5 . English lit major . Everyone thinks it 's unbelievable that a girl who is as obsessed with Chlo jeans as I am could have studied at Princeton but when I told one of the girls at the baby shower about school she said , " Oh my god ! Ivy League ! You 're like the female Stephen Hawking . " Listen , someone that brainy would never do something as crazy as spend $525 on a pair of Chlo jeans , but I just ca n't help it , like most New York girls . The reason I can just about afford the $325 jeans is because the aforementioned career consists of writing articles for a fashion magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeans will make you deliriously happy . ( I 've tried all the other jeans - Rogan , Seven , Earl , Juicy , Blue Cult-but I always come back to the classic , Chlo They just do something to your butt the others ca n't . ) The other thing that helps fund my habit is if I do n't pay my rent on my Perry Street apartment . I often do n't , because my landlord seems to like being paid in other ways , like if I let him come up for a triple espresso he reduces my rent by over 100 percent . I always say , waste not , want not , which is a terrible clich the British invented during the war to get kids to eat their whole-wheat bread , but when I say it I mean , waste not money on boring old rent when it can be un-wasted on Chlo jeans . 6 . Punctual . I am up every morning at 10:30 AM and not a minute earlier . 7 . Thrifty . You can be frugal even if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , you know , some girls get so jealous , but I hardly pay for a thing I wear . You see , fashion designers in New York love giving clothes away . Sometimes I wonder if fashion designers , who I consider to be geniuses , are actually thickos , like lots of mean people are always saying they are . Is n't giving something away for nothing when you could sell it for something a bit stupid ? But there is something really , really clever about this particular form of stupidity because fashion designer-type people all seem to own at least four expensively decorated homes ( St. Barths , Aspen , Biarritz , Paris ) , whereas all the clever people with regular jobs selling things for money only seem to own about one barely decorated house each . So I maintain that fashion designers are geniuses because it takes a genius to make money by giving things away . Overall , I can safely say that my value system is intact , despite the temptations of New York , which , I regret to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * * Talking of princesses , Mimi 's shower was packed with the Park Avenue version . Everyone was there except - oddly - Julie , the biggest princess of them all . The most glamorous girls were all working the $325-Chlo-jeans look . They looked deliriously happy . Then there was another group who were working the Harry Winston engagement ring look and they seemed what I can only describe as beyond radiant . Jolene Morgan , Carl Phillips ( who had the biggest ring , but then she 'd gotten a deal because her mom was a Winston ) , and K.K. Adams were in this group . Soon they abandoned the main party for an engagement-ring summit in Mimi 's bedroom , which is so big an entire dorm could sleep in it . Everything in there 's upholstered in dove gray chintz , even the insides of her closets . When I finally got poor George sorted out and off my cell , I joined them . Jolene - who 's curvacious and blonde and pale and worships Sophie Dahl because she heard she 's never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wondered how she could be sure this latest fianc was the right one . " Oh , easy ! I 've got a new , watertight method of selection . If you use the same criteria to choose a man that you would when choosing a handbag , I guarantee you will find one that suits you perfectly , " she explained . Jolene 's theory is that a man has many wonderful things in common with a handbag , like the fact that there 's a wait list for the best ones . Some are two weeks ( college boys and L.L. Bean totes ) , some are three years ( funny men and alligator Herms Birkin bags ) . Even if you are on the list for the whole three years , another woman with a superior claim can jump the line . Jolene says you have to hide a really sexy one or your best friend will borrow it without telling you . Her main concern is that without one , a girl looks underdressed. " ... which makes it completely understandable that a girl may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds one that really suits her , " concluded Jolene . Maybe I had misjudged Jolene Morgan : I secretly used to think she was one of the shallowest girls in New York , but Jolene has hidden depths when it comes to relationships . Sometimes you go to a baby shower expecting nothing more than a conversation about the advantages of a scheduled C-section ( you can pick your kid 's birth sign ) , and come away having learned a lot about life . The minute I got home I e-mailed Julie . To : **27;1435;TOOLONG From : Moi@moi.com Re : Happiness Just got back from Mimi 's baby shower . Darling , where were you ? Jolene , K. K. , and Cari all engaged . Have detected glaring difference between Chlo jeans happiness and engagement ring happiness this afternoon . I mean , have you any idea how awesome your skin looks if you are engaged ? * * * Julie Bergdorf has been my best friend since the minute I met her at her mother 's corner apartment in The Pierre Hotel on Fifth and Sixty-first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started Bergdorf Goodman and a whole chain of stores around America , which is why Julie says she always has at least $100 million in the bank " and not a dime more , " as she puts it . Julie spent most of her teens shoplifting from Bergdorf 's after getting out of Spence each day . She still finds it hard not to see Bergdorf 's as her walk-in closet even though most of it was sold to Neiman Marcus years ago . The best thing she ever stole was a Faberg egg encrusted with rubies that was once owned by Catherine the Great . Her excuse for her childhood hobby is that she " liked nice stuff . It must have been so icky being a Woolworth kid , I mean they used to have to shoplift , like , toilet cleaner , but I got to take really glam stuff , like handmade kid leather gloves . " Julie 's favorite words are icky and glam . Julie once said she wished there was no ickiness in the world , and I said to her , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 've got to have the ickiness just for contrast . She said , oh , like if there were no poor people then no one would be rich , and I said , well , what I actually mean is , if you were happy all the time , how would you know you were happy ? She said , because you 'd always be happy . I said , no , you have to have unhappiness to know what happiness is . Julie frowned and said , " Have you been reading The New Yorker again ? " Julie thinks The New Yorker and PBS are completely evil and boring and that everyone should read US Weekly and watch the E ! channel instead . Our mothers were both mainline Philadelphia WASPs who had been best friends in the seventies . I grew up in England because my dad 's English and everything about England is " better " according to Mom , but you do n't get department-store heiresses in England and Mom was very concerned that I should have one as a friend . Meanwhile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her daughter .
