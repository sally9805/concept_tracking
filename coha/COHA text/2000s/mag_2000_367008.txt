The owner of a chain of supercenters in Michigan would hardly seem a match for Henry Kissinger in a debate over the Vietnam War , but at the 1995 Gerald R. Ford Foundation board meeting , the former Secretary of State indeed lost a heated argument on the subject to one Fred Meijer of Grand Rapids . At issue was an 18-step metal ladder , utterly unremarkable except that in April 1975 thousands of desperate South Vietnamese , fleeing capture by the invading North Vietnamese for freedom in the U.S. , had clambered up its sturdy steps onto the roof of the U.S. embassy in Saigon and into American helicopters perched there . To Meijer , the gray ladder was an uplifting symbol of hope ; to Kissinger , it was a grim reminder of the U.S. failure in South Vietnam that had cost more than 58,000 American lives . <P> It was Meijer 's entrepreneurial son Hank who unwittingly sparked the contention when he went to Ho Chi Minh City ( formerly the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon ) in October 1994 , in search of promising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's impending normalization of relations with Vietnam . While driving down Le Duan Boulevard one afternoon , Hank Meijer asked his driver to stop at the former U.S. embassy , atop which the tragic last moments of America 's involvement in Vietnam had been played out . Abandoned since and allowed to run down into a weed-choked eyesore where only chickens wandered among the shards of broken glass , the padlocked building was slated for the wrecking ball . <P> " Then I saw the ladder from the evacuation , " Hank Meijer relates . " My first thought was , That 's an important piece of history ; perhaps I can pay somebody a few hundred bucks to weld it off with a blowtorch , then crate it up and ship it back to Michigan for display at the Ford Museum . " He resisted , but when he returned to Grand Rapids and told his father about the ladder , Fred Meijer was captivated , and determined to put those " 18 steps to freedom " on permanent display before the American people . He figured his fellow board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he broached the idea of acquiring the ladder at the next meeting he met with surprisingly harsh resistance from Kissinger . " It 's just a terrible idea , " the nation 's only celebrity diplomat kept repeating . " Why would you want to remind visitors about this horrible chapter in American history ? " <P> Somewhat startled , Meijer held his ground . " Henry , if we do n't acquire the ladder , it will end up in the bowels of the Smithsonian . " To which , an annoyed Kissinger shot back , " That 's a good place for it . " <P> Then the ex-President spoke up for his old friend Meijer , likening the " freedom ladder " to the concrete slab from the Berlin Wall that adorns the museum 's entrance . " No one knows more than I how humiliating it was , " Ford reminded his Secretary of State . " As you recall , I had to sit in the Oval Office and watch our troops get kicked out of Vietnam . But it 's part of our history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made to get the ladder . " To some , this staircase will always be seen as an emblem of military defeat , " Ford notes . " For me , however , it symbolizes man 's undying desire to be free . "
