It was a well-known fact among those in the British diplomatic corps that whenever His Majesty , King William IV , had a sticky situation on his hands , Sir Ian Moore would get the assignment . No one else had a chance . It was true that Sir Ian , thirty-five years of age , had a successful , decade-long career as a diplomat . It was true that he was unmarried , unfettered , and willing to be a roving ambassador , able to go wherever duty to king and country sent him . Of course it was true that his loyalty and honor were beyond question . But during this time of peace in Europe , truly sticky situations where a diplomat could make his mark were rare , and many of Sir Ian 's colleagues wished His Majesty 's favorite ambassador would retire to his estate in Devonshire and give the rest of them a chance to shine . The Turks and Greeks were a perfect example . Those people would test the mettle of any diplomat , so when a minor skirmish between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one was surprised when Sir Ian was sent to Anatolia . But everyone was surprised when scarcely a fortnight after his arrival in Constantinople , he was recalled to Gibraltar . Ambitious young diplomats crossed their fingers , hoping that somehow , some way , Ian Moore hadfinally blotted his copybook . Ian knew his copybook was still quite satisfactory . As to the reason for his recall from the East , however , even Ian had to confess he was baffled . " Why fetch me to Gibraltar ? " he wondered aloud , sitting in his cabin aboard the Mary Eliza , one of His Britannic Majesty 's finest and fastest ships of the line . As the ship carried him across the Mediterranean , Ian studied the map of Europe spread out on the table before him . " What could it mean ? " His valet , Harper , looked up from the shirt he was mending . " It must be very serious indeed for them to send for you so suddenly . Something big is happening . " " I can not imagine what . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this part of the world at present , and they intend to replace me in the middle of it . To what end ? " " All I know is it 's a shame . There we were in Constantinople , just settled in for a good , long stay , and then in the wink of an eye , there 's a change of plan , and we 're sailing off again . " Harper shook his head with a sigh of regret . " Pity , that , " he added . " Mighty fetching , those Turkish ladies looked in those trousers , and those veils of theirs . . . makes a man wonder what 's underneath . The sultan was going to give you one of his slave girls , you know . " " Harper , a true British gentleman would never own a slave girl . Barbaric practice . " " Maybe so , sir , but one of those Turkish girls would have worked on you like a tonic . Not to say you 've been short-tempered of late , but  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nettled . " I have not been short-tempered . " " If you say so , but you have been working hard for many months and have n't had any time for ladies . " He paused , then added , " A man needs what he needs , you know . " Ian did not want to think about how long it had been since his needs in that particular area had been met . Too long . He shot a warning glance at the servant . " Harper , that 's enough . Any more impudence from you , and I shall begin a search for a new valet . " The manservant , who had been valeting him since his fifteenth birthday , was n't the least bit intimidated . The censure in Ian 's voice slid off him like water off a duck . " Do you a world of good to loosen your cravat once in a while , sir , if you do n't mind my saying so . " " I do mind . " Ian drummed his fingers against the table , focusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Gibraltar ? " he wondered again as he considered and rejected various possibilities . " Morocco is stable . Things in Spain are quiet . As for the French , well , our relations with them are n't good , but that 's nothing new . I can not imagine what the trouble is . " " Something to do with those Italians again , I say . " Ian hoped not . " I do n't see how that is possible . The Italian situation is resolved . The Treaty of Bolgheri has been signed , the Congress of Vienna remains intact , and Princess Elena will be marrying the Duke of Ausberg when she reaches the age of twenty-one . " " Talk is , she does n't want to marry him . " " She will do her duty . She has no choice . " Harper shrugged . " That 's as may be , but girls are most unaccountable , sir . Especially the Italian ones , " he added with feeling . " It 's the temperament . " If there was anyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd spent a lot of time in that part of the world these past few years , pouring the soothing words of diplomacy over the Prince of Bolgheri and the Dukes of Venezia , Lombardy , and Tuscany , to preserve peace in the region and keep Italian nationalists from rebelling against the Austrian Empire , but despite his many trips to the region , he did not understand the Italians . He found their passions too dramatic and their moods too volatile for his fastidious British nature . Ian gave up his speculations as a futile exercise and rolled up the map . Regardless of where they proposed to send him , he would do his duty . He always did . Nonetheless , when the Mary Eliza arrived at Gibraltar , and Ian presented himself at Government House , he could not help being surprised by his next assignment . " You 're sending me to London ? " " Not I , Sir Ian , " Lord Stanton corrected him . " These orders are from the Prime Minister himself . You are to depart for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Constantinople to take your place and deal with the Turkish situation . " Continues ...
