A response to Don Browning <p> IN HIS CRITIQUE of " Living Faithfully with Families in Transition " ( June 28 ) , a report submitted to the recent assembly of the Presbyterian Church ( U.S.A. )  --  and sent back to committee for revision  --  Don Browning argues that the report fails to give practical guidance . He also charges that the report reflects an elitist denial of the negative social impact that uncommitted marriages and nonintact families have on children . <p> Unfortunately , he misses the main point of the report , and he unwittingly champions a vision of family and ministry that supports patriarchy , family abuse and society 's abdication of support for those families that do not conform to a certain model . <p> Browning complains that the report 's policy recommendations are limited in number and disappointing in content . The report 's intent , however , was to be descriptive , not prescriptive . It examines how American families have changed over the past 50 years and the ways in which social structures have responded to those changes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American social structures  --  including governmental and nongovernmental institutions  --  and values support families in the midst of these changes . Rather than displaying elitism , the report reflects a deep concern for the factionalism that has arisen around the topic of family . Browning 's critique serves only to deepen the factionalism . <p> Some of the social changes noted in the report include these : <p> In 1999 , approximately 50 percent of the after-federal-tax income of U.S. families went to the bottom 80 percent of families while the other 50 percent went to the top 20 percent of families . In 1998 , the wealthiest 1 percent of households controlled 38 percent of the nation 's wealth while the bottom 90 percent of households owned 29 percent of the nation 's wealth . In essence , since the 1950s there has been a shift in the distribution of productivity gains away from most workers and toward the wealthiest 20 percent of U.S. families . At the same time , there has been a significant retreat in government policies that once promoted education , family-formation , and home ownership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in light of Browning 's arguments about the importance of committed marriages and the data indicating that children in intact families fare better on a number of socioeconomic indices . As the report shows , the single most important factor accounting for the well-being of some children in single-parent homes is income level . <p> If there is a preoccupation with the question of family form in the family report , it is precisely because the report is concerned with equal treatment of families . This stance is especially important when nontraditional families are being criticized for outcomes that are determined less by family form and more by societal structures and values . A culture of materialism , consumerism and individualism is more of a threat to the well-being of families than are changes in family form . As the report says , " Materialism shapes what people think is important , how we spend our time as well as our money , how we frame the goals of our lives , and how we judge the value of other persons . <p> Browning makes the bold statement that children do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " they are on average more invested in both their children and each other " ( my italics ) . On what basis is Browning making this assertion ? A search of the literature does not indicate that children from disrupted families do worse because the parents are less invested in the children . It certainly is the case that parents in such cases have decided to deinvest from one another as a married couple . But it 's irresponsible to assume that they have less investment in their children than intact married couples do . <p> Browning suggests that mainline churches talk about diversity but do not actually practice it , and he also suggests that other kinds of churches may actually end up having more to offer families struggling with family issues . He does not identify these churches , but one might suspect that they are the more evangelical churches . <p> But evangelical churches are not free of family discord and disruption . And the work of Lori C. Beaman and Nancy Nason-Clark gives evidence of the experience evangelical women have with domestic abuse . ( See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Identities in Evangelical Context and Nason-Clark 's article " The Evangelical Family Is Sacred ... but Is It Safe ? " in Healing the Hurting , edited by Catherine Clark Kroeger and James R. Beck . ) Soft patriarchy , linked with wifely submission and coupled with an underlying message of " Just get or stay married , " has the potential to contribute to a forceful imposition that at times can take on physically violent dimensions . <p> Like many who dislike the message , Browning attacks the messenger , calling the report on families elitist , the product of a church that is mostly white , relatively rich and well educated , three-fourths of whose members are married and only 19 percent of whom have experienced divorce . Browning conjectures that these facts may explain why the report takes a sanguine view of the effects of family disruption . <p> The authors of the report do express concern about the effects of family disruption . The report refers to research that shows that " divorce is typically the result of a painful disintegration of a shared vision of marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and it notes that " contemporary social science research presents convincing evidence that , on average , children do better in healthy , intact two-parent families than they do in step-families , adopted families , or single-parent families ( even when taking into account a variety of factors ) . " <p> But the report also indicates that a good deal of research substantiates the claim that economic deprivation increases marital conflict and the likelihood of divorce . It points out that the impact of divorce on children is a complicated matter , and rather than suggest only one solution  --  " Get or stay married "  --  it suggests that we need to identify the many variables that lead to the poor performance of children in single-parent , step-parent or adoptive families . <p> And what of the elitism of the Religion , Culture and Family Project that Browning directs ? A review of the contributors to that project reveals that they are overwhelming white , middle-class and highly educated . Does this profile compromise the research and negate the value of their contributions ? I will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project , as Browning has challenged the authors of " Living Faithfully , " to identify the less than idealistic motives that drive their work . <p> Finally , Browning is mistaken in saying that the report makes a limited number of practical policy recommendations . In fact , the section on Policy Principles and Recommendations lists a number of practical recommendations which thoroughly challenge the social policies and structures of the government , social agencies and the church . <p> By Homer U.
