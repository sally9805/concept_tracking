It was about 3:30 Thursday afternoon when I stopped by Marilee Doerring 's house to pick up a new key . I have keys to all my clients ' houses . I carry them on a big round ring like a French chatelaine . If a robber broke into my apartment , it would n't be to rip off my Patsy Cline CDs , it would be for my key ring . I 'm Dixie Hemingway , no relation to you know who . I 'm a pet-sitter . I live on Siesta Key in Sarasota , Florida , and so do all my clients . Until three years ago , when the world crashed around me , I was a deputy with the Sarasota County Sheriff 's Department . Now I take care of animals . I go to their homes while their owners are away and feed them and groom them and play with them . They do n't ask a lot of questions or expect much from me , and I do n't have to interact with people any more than I choose to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , I was about to become a lot more involved with a lot more people than I wanted to be . Siesta Key is an eight-mile barrier island connected to the mainland by two bridges . The Gulf of Mexico laps at the west side , and Sarasota Bay and the Intracoastal Waterway are on the east . Inside the key itself , there are fifty miles of canals , so we have almost as many boats and boat docks as we have seabirds , which is a bunch . You name it , we 've got it . Terns , plovers , gulls , egrets , herons , cranes , spoonbills , storks , ibis , and pelicans all happily scoop up their favorite entres on our beaches and in our backyards . Offshore , manatees and dolphins play in the warm water . Counting part-time residents , the key is home to about 24,000 suntanned people . Except for " the season , " whensnowbirds come down and inflict their money on us , and spring break , when college students get drunk and pee on the hibiscus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the map , it looks like an alligator 's head with an extremely long and skinny nose . Siesta Village and Roberts Bay form the head , with Crescent Beach where eyes would be . The nose is just wide enough for one street -- Midnight Pass Road -- with private lanes and tourist lodgings on each side , along with occasional undeveloped wooded areas . Marilee 's cat was a silver-blue Abyssinian named Ghost . Awful name , sweet cat . I had taken care of him several times before , and the only thing different about this time was that Marilee had called the night before to tell me she 'd had her locks changed , so I would have to pick up a new key before she left town . She lived on the bay side of Midnight Pass Road , about midway between Turtle Beach and the south bridge . Her street was curvy , lushly tree-lined and short , the house a low-slung stucco with a red barrel-tile roof and deep recessed arches over doors and windows , the kind of Mexican-Mediterranean hybrid that Floridians love . Dwarf schefflerias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the front yard , interspersed with clumps of red geraniums and bird of paradise plants . The front door undoubtedly had once hung on a cathedral in some South American country , and the doorbell was a deep-bonging thing that sounded like it might have come from the same cathedral . As I waited , I could hear the faint sound of classical piano music from next door . Marilee opened the door a cautious slit and peered out at me . Later , I would wonder about that , but at the time it did n't seem unusual for a cat owner . A cat can be taking a nap on its hundred-dollar kitty pillow or watching a television program especially designed for its feline pleasure , but let somebody open an outside door the narrowest bit , and it will go streaking out like it 's escaping a torture chamber . Marilee was stunningly beautiful , with glossy black hair tumbling over her shoulders in the kind of casual disarray that takes a lot of work . It framed an oval face with skin like a cosmetic commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that perfect . Her eyes were dark violet blue , with thick black lashes , and her mouth had the kind of moist expectancy that automatically makes you think of sex . I could smell expensive perfume , the kind I 've only worn by rubbing a strip from a magazine on my wrist . She was wearing a short pink terry-cloth robe that cost more than my entire wardrobe , including the winter coat I have salted away in mothballs in case I ever travel north . Her legs were long and slim , tanned enough to look healthy but not so dark as to look like she tarted herself up in a tanning booth . At first she looked surprised to see me , then in that breathy voice of hers , said , " Oh , you 've come for the key ! I was just about to jump in the shower . Hold on , I 'll get it . " She closed the door and I imagined her bare feet sprinting over Mexican tile . Next door , the music stopped and a moment later the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and headed toward Midnight Pass Road . As it made the turn , I could see the driver was a young man , no more than a teenager , which surprised me . Somehow , I never think of teenagers listening to classical music , which shows what a lowbrow I am . Marilee opened the door again , wider this time , and stretched her arm out , with a loop of red silk ribbon dangling from a finger . A shiny new door key hung on the ribbon like a gold pendant on a necklace . Feeling a bit like the upstairs maid , I held out my hand and let her drop it into my palm . I said , " Do n't forget to leave me a number where I can reach you , and the date and time you 'll return . " I should have whipped out my notebook and made her give me the number right then . But she knew the routine , and I already had all the pertinent information in my files -- her vet 's name and number , the dates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite foods and toys and where they were located , and his favorite hiding place in case he decided to play Where 's Ghost ? I told her to have a safe journey and not to worry about Ghost , and went on my merry way . I never saw Marilee again , at least not alive . My alarm went off at 4:00 the next morning , and I got right up . One thing you can say for me , I wake up well . I sleep in underpants , so all I had to do was pull on khaki cargo shorts and a T-shirt and lace up my Keds . I brushed my teeth , splashed water on my face , pulled my hair into a ponytail , and I was ready . Animals do n't expect you to dress up for them . I could go naked for all they care . By 4:15 , I was halfway to my first stop . The sky was just beginning to pink a little around the edges , and the early April air was a balmy seventy degrees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Key , tickling the undersides of palm leaves and sending orgasmic tremors through trailing bougainvillea . Snowy egrets open their topaz eyes and stretch their blue-toed feet , and great blue herons stilt-leg it to the edge of the shore to pick up breakfast coming in on the tide . The air tastes of brine and fish and sand , and throaty chants of mourning doves underscore the squawk of seagulls rising and circling on air currents . It 's my favorite time of day , a time when I have the streets almost to myself and can zoom along on my bike like a gull looking for early-waking grubs and unwary snails . I always see to the dogs first and leave the cats and occasional birds and rabbits and hamsters for later . It is n't that I play favorites , it 's just that dogs are needier than other pets . Leave a dog alone for very long and it 'll start going a little nuts . Cats , on the other hand , try to give you the impression they did n't even know you were gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll say . " I did n't notice . " Then they 'll raise their tails to show you their little puckered anuses and walk away . My first stop was at Sam and Libby Grayson 's , a retired couple who had gone north to visit their daughter . A wooded area separated the Graysons ' street from Marilee 's , and with tall trees lining the street and woods behind , it was like being in the middle of a dark forest . The Graysons ' house was a two-story ultramodern built of cypress and glass , with a high vaulted cage around the lanai that gave it a look of dignified exuberance . One of the bulbs in the twin coach lights flanking their garage had burned out , and I made a mental note to replace it when I came back in the afternoon . Until a few years ago , nobody on Siesta Key ever thought about burning security lights . But since everybody north of Georgia seems to have looked up one day and said , " By gawd , I 'm moving to Florida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even a murder now and then . So now people on Siesta Key leave night lights burning so potential burglars and rapists can see better . I propped my bike in front of the garage and sorted through my keys . Rufus , the Grayson 's schnauzer , started barking to show me he was on the job as guard dog , but he knew it was me and his heart was n't in it . As soon as I pushed open the door , he was all over me , not the least bit ashamed to let me see how glad he was that I had come . I like that about dogs . They do n't worry that you might not like them as much as they like you and hold off until they 're sure , they just go ahead and declare themselves and take the chance of being rejected . I knelt down to hug him and let him kiss my chin . " Hey , old sweet Rufus , " I said , " How 's my old sweet Rufus ? " Dogs like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . Cats expect you to have more self-restraint . I got his leash out of the wicker basket in the foyer , and as soon as I opened the door , he was out like a shot . I had to hold him steady while I locked the door behind me , and then we both loped off . Rufus plunged off the pavement to pee on a palm tree , then raced on ahead of me . My Keds made smacking sounds on the asphalt , so I moved to the edge of the street where pine needles muffled the noise . I did n't want to cause some retiree to think a criminal was running down the street and haul out his handgun . Something about not having to shovel snow anymore and being surrounded by sunshine and tropical foliage 365 days of the year causes a lot of people to feel so guilty that they compensate by scaring themselves with thoughts of imminent crime . They go out and buy themselves a gun and sort of hope they 'll get to shoot somebody with it , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to a hibiscus bush and I picked it up in a poop bag and kicked a cover of pine needles over the spot before I moved on . I like to be tidy . I let the leash play out so Rufus could feel independent , and he bounced into the middle of the street to check out a fluffy egret feather . He whoofed at it and nosed it around , showing off to let me see he was alert to anything new . Something caught his attention from the woods , and he raised his head and began barking loud , enough to wake everybody on the block . I jerked the leash taut and said , " Shhhh ! Quiet ! " He barked again and I turned to look over my right shoulder . I could have sworn I saw a figure slip behind a tree trunk in the murky shadows . Any number of things could have been moving around back there in the predawn shadows . A snowy egret or a great blue heron could have dived for a baby black snake from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early and leaped from a branch with a flash of white underbelly . Or somebody returning from a middle-of-the-night tryst might have seen me and ducked into that dark thicket . God knows , there are plenty of men and women who drift in and out of one another 's beds here on the key , and some of them are married to other people . But still , the skin on my shoulders puckered and I felt uneasy , with that tingly feeling that tells you unfriendly eyes are watching . I yanked Rufus out of the street and set off for the Graysons ' house so fast , he had to do a scrambling dance to catch up . As we trotted up the driveway , the Herald Tribune delivery man turned into the street and sailed a paper into the flower bed by the front walk . I retrieved it and put it in a wooden chest outside the front door where people leave drop-offs when the Graysons are n't home . Somebody had left a stack of paperbacks rubber-banded together , and in the pale glow cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post-it stuck on top with a heavily scrawled " Thanx ! " I fed and brushed Rufus and put out fresh water for him . With him following me like an aide carrying a clipboard , I did a fast check of the house to make sure he had n't gotten bored over night and chewed up something . The Graysons ' latest acquisition was a full-sized carousel horse that had once been part of John Ringling 's collection -- Ringling practically built Sarasota , and you ca n't turn around here without seeing something circus-related . The horse was mounted on a floor-to-ceiling brass pole in the dining room , and it gave the room a happy , carefree look . I took a moment to admire it before I turned on the TV in the den for Rufus . I set it on Nickelodeon so he could watch Mister Ed . Then I hugged him good-bye . " I 'll be back tonight , " I promised . " You be a good boy , okay ? " I do n't know why I ask animals questions like that . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freak out . Rufus was sitting in the front hall with his head cocked to one side when I shut the door behind me . I felt guilty leaving him alone , but everybody has to come to the realization sooner or later that we 're all alone in this world .
