The Churchills and the Raj // And Blenheim ? s Tower shall triumph O ? er Whitehall  --  anonymous pamphleteer , 1705 // On November 30 , 1874 , another baby boy was born on the other side of the world . This one also first saw light in his grandfather ? s house , but on a far grander scale  --  indeed , in the biggest private home in Britain . // Surrounded by three thousand acres of " green lawns and shining water , banks of laurel and fern , groves of oak and cedar , fountains and islands , " Blenheim Castle boasted 187 rooms.1 It was in a drafty bedroom on the first floor that Jennie Jerome Churchill gave birth to her first child . " Dark eyes and hair " was how her twenty-five-year-old husband , Randolph Churchill , described the boy to Jennie ? s mother , and " wonderfully very pretty everybody says . " 2 // The child ? s baptized name would be Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill . If the Gandhis were unknown outside their tiny Indian state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first Duke of Marlborough , had been Europe ? s most acclaimed general and the most powerful man in Britain . His series of victories over France in the first decade of the eighteenth century had made Britain a world-class power . A grateful Queen Anne gave him the royal estate at Woodstock on which to build a palace , which he named after his most famous victory . For Winston Churchill , Blenheim Castle would always symbolize a heritage of glory and a family born to greatness . // Yet the first Duke of Marlborough had been followed by a succession of nonentities . If the power and wealth of England expanded to unimagined heights over the next century , that of the Churchills steadily declined . // The vast fortune that the first duke accumulated in the age of Queen Anne was squandered by his successors . When Randolph ? s father inherited the title in 1857 , the same year the Great Mutiny raged in India , he had been faced , like his father and grandfather before him , by debts of Himalayan proportions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s grandfather had already turned Blenheim into a public museum , charging visitors one shilling admission . Randolph ? s father would have to sell off priceless paintings ( including a Raphael and Van Dyck ? s splendid equestrian portrait of King Charles I , still the largest painting in the National Gallery ) , the fabulous Marlborough collection of gems , and the eighteen-thousand-volume Sunderland library , in order to make ends meet.3 // In the financial squeeze which was beginning to affect nearly all the Victorian aristocracy , the Spencer-Churchills felt the pinch more than most . For Randolph Churchill , the Marlborough legacy was a bankrupt inheritance . In a crucial sense , it was no inheritance at all . His older brother , Lord Blandford , would take over the title , Blenheim , and the remaining estates . What was left for him , and for his heirs , was relatively paltry ( although much more than the patrimony of the great majority of Britons ) , with ? 4,200 a year and the lease on a house in Mayfair.4 // So the new father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own way into the world , just as his son would . And both would choose the same way : politics . // Randolph was the family rebel , a natural contrarian and malcontent . Beneath his pale bulging eyes , large exquisite mustache , and cool aristocratic hauteur was the soul of a headstrong alpha male . As he told his friend Lord Rosebery , " I like to be the boss . " 5 Young Lord Randolph was determined to make a name for himself as a member of Parliament . All he needed was an issue . // In 1874 an issue was not easy to find . At the time when Winston Churchill was born , British politics reflected a consensus that the country had not known in nearly a hundred years  --  and soon would never know again.6 The last big domestic battle had been fought over the Second Reform Bill of 1867 , when crowds in London clashed in the streets with police and tore up railings around Hyde Park . Passage of the act opened the door to Britain ? s first working-class voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were inclined to let it swing open any wider . // Both parties agreed that free trade was the cornerstone of the British economy , still the most productive in the world . Both agreed on the importance of keeping the gold standard . They even agreed that social reform was best left in private and local hands , although Parliament would occasionally give its approval to a round of slum clearances or a comprehensive health act . A twelve-hour day for the average workman , and ten and a half hours for women and young persons older than thirteen , made eminent good sense economically and morally . Giving them a government retirement pension or an unemployment check did not.7 // Tories and Liberals also agreed on maintaining an empire that was without rival and on defending it with a navy that was second to none . In 1874 that empire was not only the most extensive but the most cohesive on the planet.8 It emcompassed Britain itself , with England , Wales , Scotland , and Ireland welded together under a single government and crown . Across the Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada , the empire ? s first self-governing " dominion "  --  a word that would loom large in the later battles between Churchill and Gandhi . // Then there were the prosperous and stable colonies of white settlers in New Zealand and Australia which , although more than ten thousand miles away , felt a strong bond of loyalty to Britain and the Crown . Britain also directed the fate of two colonies in southern Africa , the Cape Colony and Natal , in addition to Lagos in Nigeria . Hong Kong , Singapore , and some scattered possessions in Asia and the Mediterranean completed the collection . // But the centerpiece of the empire was India , where Britain was the undisputed master of more than a quarter billion people . In 1874 two out of every three British subjects was an Indian . Since the Mutiny both political parties had closed ranks about dealing with India . The power of the British system of governance , or the Raj as it was called after the Mutiny , had become more extensive and more streamlined . The opening of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier to reach the ancient subcontinent than in the days before the Mutiny . // Most Britons still knew almost nothing about the subcontinent or its peoples . Nonetheless , the fact that they possessed India , and governed it virtually as a separate empire , gave Britons a halo of superpower status that no other people or nation could match . The attitude was summed up nine years later in Rudyard Kipling ? s poem " Ave Imperatrix " : // And all are bred to do your will // By land and sea  --  wherever flies // The Flag , to fight and follow still , // And work your Empire ? s destinies . // In the midst of this triumphant march to the future , the only hint of trouble was Ireland . The question of whether the Catholic Irish would ever enjoy any degree of " home rule " had become a live issue in Irish politics . In 1875 it sent Charles Stewart Parnell to Parliament , but otherwise Irish nationalism hardly registered in Westminster ; nor did any other issue. * // There seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no bitter clash of interests , no looming threats on the horizon for an unknown but ambitious politician to seize on . By 1880 Randolph realized he had only one way to get attention in Parliament : by becoming a nuisance and stirring things up . // The issue Winston ? s father seized upon was the Bradlaugh case . Charles Bradlaugh was a Liberal and a radical atheist who , when elected to Parliament that year , refused to take the oath of allegiance needed to take his seat in the Commons , because it contained the words " so help me God . " The question of whether Bradlaugh should be allowed to take his seat anyway stirred the hearts of many Conservative members , and Randolph ? s friend Sir Henry Drummond Wolff asked his help against Bradlaugh. // Randolph soon discovered that Bradlaugh made an easy target.9 He was not only a free thinker but a socialist , an advocate of birth control , and even a critic of Empire . Bradlaugh was also a radical republican who denounced the monarchy and aristocrats like Randolph in heated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 , 1880 , condemning Bradlaugh for his atheism , he also read aloud from one of Bradlaugh ? s pamphlets calling the royal family " small German breast-beating wanderers , whose only merit is their loving hatred of one another . " He then hurled the pamphlet on the floor and stamped on it . // The House was ecstatic . " Everyone was full of it , " Jennie wrote , who // * It would be registering sooner than most realized . Ironically , Kipling ? s triumphant poem was composed in 1882 , after the exposure of an Irish plot to assassinate Queen Victoria , to reassure the British public . Winston Churchill ? s earliest childhood memory was of wandering through Dublin ? s Phoenix Park and seeing the point where the British viceroy had been murdered only a couple of years earlier . // ? He would also be one of the first champions of Indian nationalism . When he died in 1891 and was buried in London ? s Brookwood Cemetery , among the three thousand mourners who attended the funeral would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gallery , " and rushed up and congratulated me to such an extent that I felt as though I had made it . " 10 Lord Randolph Churchill ? s career was launched as a sensational , even outrageous , headline-grabber . Together with Wolff and another friend , Sir Henry Gorst , he formed what came to be known as the Fourth Party , * a junta of Tory mavericks who ripped into their own party leaders any time they sided with the government , to the delight of journalists and newspaper readers . // Suddenly , thanks to Randolph Churchill , politics was fun again . When Bradlaugh was reelected in spite of being denied his seat , Randolph attacked him again , carefully playing it for laughs and for the gallery and the news media ; when the voters of Northampton insisted on returning Bradlaugh again , Randolph did the same thing . And then a fourth and a fifth time : at one point Bradlaugh had to be escorted out of the House chamber by police and locked up in the Big Ben tower . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters to keep voting for Bradlaugh , since they were also keeping Randolph in the headlines.11 // Lord Randolph had the good sense to realize that while the Bradlaugh case had launched his political rise , he needed more substantial issues to sustain it . He tried Ireland for a while , taking up the cause of Ulster Protestants in the North and lambasting the Irish nationalists of the south . He tested a new catchphrase , " Tory Democracy , " urging Conservatives to win votes and allies among Britain ? s newly enfranchised working class  --  but the phrase had more headline appeal than substance or thought behind it . He even tried Egypt , furiously denouncing the Liberal government ? s support of its corrupt ruler . Finally in the summer of 1884 , the man an American journalist called " the political sensation of England " turned to India . // Crucial though India was to the empire , few politicians had any expertise in the empire ? s greatest possession . In November 1884 Churchill planned a major tour of India . His friend Wilfred Blunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key introductions . He predicted " a great future for any statesman who will preach Tory Democracy in India . " 12 Lord Randolph left in December and did not return to London until April 1885 , after logging more than 22,800 miles . He then delivered a round of fiery speeches denouncing the Gladstone government ? s // * After the Liberals , Tories , and Irish Nationalists . // policies there , from neglecting the threat from Russia to failing to gain more native participation in the Raj . The speeches established him as the Conservatives ? " front line spokesman on India . " 13 So when they returned to power in June that year , he was the obvious candidate for secretary of state for India . // In terms of direct influence over people ? s lives , it was the single most powerful position in the cabinet , even more powerful than prime minister . At age thirty-six , Randolph Churchill would be overseeing an imperial domain that was , as he discovered in his travels and readings , unique in British history  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built an empire in India , conquering one of the most ancient and powerful civilizations in the world , is an epic of heroism , sacrifice , ruthlessness , and greed . But it is also the story of a growing sense of mission , even destiny : the growing conviction that the British were meant to rule India not only for their own interests but for the sake of the Indians as well . That belief would decisively shape the character not only of the British Empire in India but also of Randolph ? s son Winston Churchill  --  the man into whose hands the destiny of the Raj would ultimately fall . // Ironically , that empire ? s founding fathers , the group of God-fearing merchants living in Shakespeare ? s London who created the Honorable East India Company , never intended to go to India at all  --  any more than Queen Elizabeth I did when she gave them a royal charter on the last day of 1600 . Their aim was to get to the Spice Islands ( the Molucca Islands in today ? s Indonesia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adventurers were battling over fortunes in nutmeg , cloves , and mace . The East India Company ? s initial stop at Surat , on India ? s west coast , was supposed to be only a layover for ventures farther east . // But when the Dutch tortured and murdered ten of their merchants in the island of Amboyne in 1623 and foisted the English out of the Spice Islands , the London-based company had nowhere else to go.14 By 1650 , the year John Churchill was born in Devon , the East India Company found itself precariously perched in a tiny settlement near Surat called Fort St. George , doing business at the pleasure of the rulers of India , the Mughal emperors  --  at the time probably the richest human beings in the world . In 1674 the company acquired a similar outpost at Bombay , which King Charles II had received as a wedding present from the king of Portugal . Then in 1690 it built another , in Bengal at Kalikat , which the English pronounced Calcutta . //       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
