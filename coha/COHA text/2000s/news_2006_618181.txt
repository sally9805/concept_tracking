<p> Gov . Sonny Perdue is the state 's first chief executive since at least the 1970s not to have put his assets into a blind trust , which has spurred criticism by political opponents that he 's been able to openly pad his bankroll while serving in public office . <p> But not all governors , or other powerful elected officials , for that matter , put their assets into trusts to be managed independently by someone else when they take office . And even some who have , such as Florida Gov . Jeb Bush and U.S. Sen. Bill Frist ( R-Tenn. ) , have wound up being accused of either having investments with ties to government policy or personally trading stocks supposedly managed by a third party . <p> Because many state laws force governors and lawmakers to disclose their assets once a year , even politicians with blind trusts get to see how their money , stocks and businesses are being managed . <p> " The idea of a blind trust is that the governor will no longer have direct control over assets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Integrity , a nonpartisan research organization . " It 's sort of a questionable area as to whether it makes a big difference . " <p> Blind trusts are designed to shield public officials from charges that they use their political power to increase wealth . The trusts are often set up by friends or lawyers of public officials , who manage the stocks or other investments while the politician is in office . <p> The issue is being raised now , 3 1/2 years after Perdue took office , because of news reports that he 's been involved in several large land deals , including one with a developer he appointed to a state board . In addition , Perdue signed a tax bill with a barely noticed provision that afforded him a $100,000 tax deferral on one of those deals . <p> Perdue said he decided against a blind trust when he took office in 2003 because he did n't think an independent trustee could adequately manage his Houston County fertilizer and grain company . But that has left the Republican governor open to criticism from Democrats , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deals while earning a $131,000 state paycheck . <p> " If in the morning I 'm deciding where to build a road for the state and in the afternoon I 'm deciding where to buy land for myself , then , frankly , I might find that one meeting runs into the other , " said Rep. Tom Bordeaux ( D-Savannah ) , former assistant floor leader for Gov . Zell Miller . " A blind trust would prevent that collision . And the possibility of that collusion . " <p> Georgia 's past three governors  --  Joe Frank Harris , Miller and Roy Barnes  --  created blind trusts when they were elected . Each was a strong believer that such trusts helped give Georgians confidence that , as governor , their decisions were n't designed to make them rich . <p> " Any person that holds a position of influence , particularly with the ability to control legislation , should put their assets into a blind trust , " said Barnes , who was defeated by Perdue in 2002 . Blind trusts are not a legal requirement in Georgia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note that state law requires governors and lawmakers to disclose their assets once a year , which makes " blind trusts " not so blind . They argue that having a friend manage their assets while they are in office does n't necessarily make politicians more ethical . <p> " Just because you put things into a blind trust , it does n't automatically make you a saint , " said former state Sen. Rusty Paul , a lobbyist who once headed the Georgia Republican Party . <p> Land in Florida , Georgia <p> Democrats have criticized Perdue 's lack of a blind trust ever since The Atlanta Journal-Constitution disclosed that the Republican governor sold 318 acres of inherited land in Houston County in 2004 , then used $2 million in proceeds to buy Florida property from developer Stanley Thomas . A year earlier , Perdue had appointed Thomas , a campaign contributor , to the state 's economic development board . <p> The 20-acre Florida tract is surrounded by pricey development and is near I-4 and a new toll road leading to Disney World . Nearby lots of a half-acre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Florida property potentially lucrative . <p> A month after he bought the Florida property , House Ways &; Means Chairman Larry O'Neal ( R-Warner Robins ) , a lawyer who has created business partnerships for Perdue , sponsored a bill to allow Georgians who sell property in the state and buy out-of-state property to defer paying a capital gains tax . O'Neal pushed an amended version of the bill late in the 2005 session that made the tax benefits retroactive to property sold in 2004 . That allowed Perdue to defer taxes on the sale of his Houston County property . Perdue signed the bill into law three days before the annual April 15 tax deadline and took advantage of the tax break when he filed that year . <p> Perdue said he bought land in Florida because a Georgia purchase would have led to charges that he used his political influence to build roads or make other improvements to increase the value of his property . However , he also spent more than $300,000 in 2004 to buy Houston County land next to another major proposed development . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than doubled in value since he bought it , according to Houston County tax records . <p> Degrees of ' blindness ' <p> Exact figures on which governors use blind trusts are hard to come by . Rush said her organization , the Center for Public Integrity , is researching the subject . <p> A spot check by the Journal-Constitution showed that , among Southern governors , Republicans Jeb Bush of Florida , Haley Barbour of Mississippi and Phil Bredesen of Tennessee put assets into trusts when they took office . Republican Govs . Bob Riley of Alabama and Mark Sanford of South Carolina did not , according to their staffs . <p> " The blind trust does give citizens confidence the governor is not in office to push his own personal financial goals , " Rush said . " It elevates the public 's confidence that ' my governor is not going to worry about his personal stuff while I pay him a salary to do the state 's work . ' " <p> But Rush said it 's " questionable " whether such trusts make a big difference , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trusts . <p> In states like Georgia , governors have to file financial disclosure reports each year , so their assets are made public . Harris , who served as governor from 1983 to 1990 , dissolved his blind trust in 1986 , saying a financial disclosure law passed in the mid-1980s meant he could n't be blind to what was in the trust . However , Miller and Barnes kept blind trusts throughout their tenures . <p> Barnes disputed the notion that disclosure laws lessened the value of having a trust . <p> " I did n't even fill out the financial reports , " Barnes said . " Do you know when I saw what I had ? When it was published in the newspaper . " <p> Barnes ' trust proved to be a financial roller coaster . After three years , his net worth was down from the $9.5 million he started his term with . However , a run-up in bank stock prices boosted his net worth to $12.3 million in mid-2002 , the last time he had to file a disclosure . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net worth was put at $6 million , up from about $4.48 million in 2002 . However , he placed a " current value " of $185,700 on the Florida land he had purchased for $2.038 million in December 2004 . That 's the assessed value used by tax officials after special exemptions and covenants are included . If Perdue had listed the property as being worth what he paid for it a little more than a year earlier , his net worth would be counted as $8 million . <p> Even politicians who use trusts face criticism . <p> Florida Gov . Jeb Bush was slammed in 2002 because the two close political confidants that he chose to manage his trust made investments affected by Florida policy . <p> More recently , Frist came under insider-trading scrutiny for selling stock from several blind trusts in the hospital business his family started . <p> Not all trusts involve big-money investment deals . When he was governor , Miller put assets into a blind trust managed by Ed Sims , an Atlanta lawyer who chaired the state Democratic Party . Miller revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was running for re-election . His $340,000 worth of savings was stashed in four certificates of deposit and a checking account , safe investments , but destined to look downright pedestrian in the go-go stock market boom of the 1990s . <p> " He did n't want anybody to second-guess or criticize any of his decisions being based on personal interest , " said Keith Mason , Miller 's former chief of staff , who also put his assets into a blind trust . " He was highly sensitive to that . " <p> Paul , the former Republican lawmaker , said such trusts would n't work for many of Georgia 's 236 part-time legislators . He said his marketing business , which relies heavily on his personal contacts and skills , could n't have been run by an outside manager while he served in the state Senate . <p> " If I were to leave this business , it would shut down , " he said . " I ca n't put this business in a blind trust . My assets are in an active , ongoing business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument . <p> " At least the Democrats acknowledge that the flesh is weak and subject to temptation , " he said . " I guess Gov . Perdue wants us to believe he 's above being tempted . " Photo : Gov . Sonny Perdue says his business could not be handled adequately by a blind trust . Photo : Former Govs .
