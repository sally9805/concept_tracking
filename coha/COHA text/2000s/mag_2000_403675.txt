/Jan 2000 Seven-year-old Elise rarely eats in restaurants , and brings her own cupcakes to birthday parties . On school pizza days , she brings pizza made at home . She has a separate keyboard to plug into school computers and she always washes her hands when she enters her second-grade classroom . Posters bearing her picture are plastered around the school  --  in the classroom , staff room , gym , library  --  and her class eats at a special table in the lunchroom every day . Elise has an enemy lurking in her Vancouver public school , one she must avoid at all costs : peanuts . Ingesting peanut protein can send Elise into anaphylactic shock , which , according to her mother and medical experts , is frighteningly swift , severe and potentially fatal . The problem is , her foe is often the best friend of her classmates  --  peanut butter is a staple in North American lunch boxes  --  and its presence in Canada 's elementary schools has led to demands for change and , in some cases , tenacious debate . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nova Scotia banned peanuts from school premises , a move prompted by the life-threatening allergy of six-year-old Leigan Stapleton . A series of heated letters followed in The Halifax Daily News : " It is ludicrous to punish an entire school for the problem of one child , " wrote one reader . Another retorted : " It will not kill children to live without peanuts for six hours , while it would kill a child with the allergy in less than three minutes . " In late 1998 , Calgarians were embroiled in a similar controversy : Melina Leduc Benson pulled her six-year-old daughter from grade one at Erin Woods school when she could n't be guaranteed a nut-free environment . That same fall , Omar Maldonado did the same . His three-year-old son , Max , was enrolled in junior kindergarten in the Toronto Separate School Board . Maldonado says the school 's policies were n't efficient , and the administration " was n't positive " about making changes to provide Max with a safe school . So Maldonado withdrew Max and enrolled him in a nut-free private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we needed the peace of mind , " says Maldonado . " And it 's there . He 's looked after in a very positive way . You need to do your best to protect your child . If you do n't do your best to prevent a reaction , you 're only going to feel miserable . " Banning peanuts may sound rash , but for a severely anaphylactic child like Elise , even tiny amounts can kill . ( About one percent of the population is at risk of anaphylaxis . ) Most anaphylactic reactions are a result of cross contamination , where an allergic child accidentally ingests traces of peanut . At least two Canadian children have died this way  --  one from eating a cheese sandwich packaged with a peanut butter sandwich , and another from a jam sandwich made with a knife that someone else dipped in peanut butter . Unfortunately , as long as children love their M &M's,; granola bars and even Ritz crackers  --  all of which can contain trace amounts of peanut  --  many schools do n't dare to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents of allergic kids advocate an all-out ban . Calgary mother Nancy Wiebe , who found out about her daughter Laura 's anaphylactic allergy to peanuts four years ago , feels strongly that telling parents what their child is permitted to eat can have a negative effect . " It hits them in the face when the school tells them what they can and ca n't put in their kids ' lunches . The peanut ban puts people 's backs up . You 're starting off with people feeling defensive , and it 's hard to move back to a co-operative position from there . " It 's important to understand that not every peanut allergy is life-threatening , says Caroline Graham , a Toronto allergist . Symptoms vary enormously . Modest reactions include hives , swollen skin tissue , and flushed or itchy skin ; these allergies are n't considered anaphylactic . " Anaphylaxis usually includes a skin reaction plus one or more of the severe reactions  --  respiratory , gastrointestinal or cardiovascular , " says Graham . Respiratory reactions can include throat swelling , asthma , coughing and wheezing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cardiovascular reactions result in a drop in blood pressure , light-headedness and collapse . Elise had two anaphylactic reactions to peanuts as a toddler  --  the second more severe than the first  --  before a paediatric allergist diagnosed her . " Her face and eyes swelled shut , " remembers her mom . " The only comparison I can think of was that she looked like she 'd been beaten . She could n't communicate , she had trouble breathing and she was dazed and throwing up . " Since her diagnosis , Elise has worn a fanny pack containing an EpiPen , which can be lifesaving first aid . The injector , which resembles a fat marker , is filled with epinephrine ( adrenaline ) and is administered in an emergency by pushing its needle-like tip against the upper thigh . The drug then rapidly constricts blood vessels and relaxes muscles in the lungs to reverse swelling and improve breathing ( until the child can get to emergency ) . Anaphylactic children and adults carry the EpiPen , whether they are allergic to milk , seafood or wasps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Graham says peanuts are undoubtedly a more potent allergen than other foods . Peanut butter has a nasty reputation , and for good reason . " We allergists put it on a bit of a pedestal , but I think we 're justified , " she explains . " A smaller amount of peanut is required to trigger a reaction than , for example , milk . Those with allergies to peanuts also tend to have more severe reactions  --  but why , we do n't know . " There are a lot of unknowns . Reliable Canadian statistics are few , though recent data suggest that roughly three million Americans suffer from nut allergies and about 100 to 125 deaths from anaphylactic reactions occur each year in the US . Graham says these numbers can be divided by ten to provide a sketchy idea of the situation in Canada , but how many of these deaths occur from peanuts is not clear . Graham is a would provide a place where those with anaphylaxis could report their cases . When her daughter was first diagnosed , Nancy Wiebe was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scary when you first find out and you leave the doctor 's office with almost no idea how to live with it , " says the mother of two . " It 's pretty intimidating . " After researching the issue intensively , Wiebe co-founded the Calgary Allergy Network in early 1997 . Today , her Web site ( see Resources ) is getting visits from all over the world . " It started as an anaphylaxis support group , but it 's more of an info hub now . I put people in touch with resources and other parents . " Wiebe believes it is in Laura 's best interest to be schooled in a realistic environment  --  one where peanuts are not altogether absent . " It 's natural to want to protect your children , " she says . " But for me it 's a training issue  --  my daughter needs to learn to live in a world with peanuts . By the time she gets into junior high , she 'll need those living skills . My goal is to get her completely comfortable with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her allergy at an older age . Banning does n't address that at all . " Elise 's mother , Isabel Grant , agrees that bans are impractical , but she insists on limits . " I do n't buy into the " false sense of security " argument because when someone 's life is at stake , you need to be very rigorous . Elise needs to learn how to live in the world , and as she grows up , she 'll start exercising her own control . But I do n't think that because she needs to learn how to live in the world , we should relax and not have limits on nuts in schools . " Stewart Black , a Montreal father , says he 's not asking the parents of his allergic seven-year-old 's classmates to stop feeding their kids peanut butter  --  just not to send it to school . " I do believe that we should make elementary schools peanut-free , " he says . " I 'm aware that it might not be 100 percent , but we 're talking about kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidents happen . When they 're in the lower grades , they need help . " Despite the differences in opinion , each of these parents agrees that educating both adults and children is essential . Videos and books , says Wiebe , are among the best investments a school can make ( see Resources ) . Not only do these resources lower risks , notes Wiebe , they teach children about respect . Indeed , most parents of peanut-allergic kids say that their children 's most helpful supporters are their classmates . " The kids are great , " says Black . " They seem to understand the allergy better than anyone , and they 're so happy to co-operate . " Adds Grant : " The world would be a much simpler place if it were run by kids .

Why is it so much more prevalent now ? Just as there is mystery surrounding the particular potency of peanuts as an allergen , it is also unclear why peanut allergies affect so many more children than they once did . Caroline Graham , a Toronto allergist , says there are three closely related theories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involves the large increase in peanut consumption among North Americans . Between the late 1980s and early 1990s , peanut-butter consumption increased by billions of kilograms . " Peanuts are in more foods than ever , " says Graham . " Therefore the exposure is greater . " This means that an undiagnosed peanut-allergic child will almost inevitably come into contact with peanut protein at some point . Another theory is supported by evidence that peanut butter is being introduced to North American children at an earlier age , quite often when they are under 12 months . " Instead of adapting to the substance , a sensitivity occurs because their life and immune systems are so immature , " Graham explains . The third theory relates closely to the second . Some experts believe the allergy may develop in utero : The fetus absorbs the protein of a peanut product consumed by its mother and becomes sensitive to it . Many allergists and allergy-information groups are now trying to let women know  --  particularly those with a family history of allergies  --  that eating peanuts during pregnancy may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
