When Kim Jong Il succeeded his father as leader of North Korea six years ago , he was lampooned by the rest of the world as a pudgy playboy who drank cognac while his countrymen barely subsisted , many of them reduced to eating roots . He favored James Bond and Daffy Duck in his collection of some 20,000 videotapes . He was a lush who once showed up at a meeting so drunk that his father had him thrown out . Nobody had heard him utter anything more than " Glory to the heroic Korean People 's Army ! " He had a Howard Hughes-like obsession about germs , was so paranoid that he would have rivals purged , so ruthless that he was accused of masterminding a plot to assassinate a South Korean President and to down an airliner . He wore shoe lifts . <P> The portrait created by these rumors and suspicions  --  North Korea 's Dear Leader was unpredictable and goofy , and because he was thought to control a nuclear weapons program on one side of the world 's most fortified border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's summit in Pyongyang . When Kim Jong Il , still pudgy , and still wearing a poufy black hairdo , reached out with both hands to welcome South Korean President Kim Dae Jung , the makeover of the madman image was complete . The 58-year-old leader of the world 's most mysterious country had been transformed into a fellow who could crack jokes at his own expense , banter about kimchi recipes and show proper Confucian deference to the elder President Kim . " I am aware that one of your legs is not very comfortable , " he remarked to his 74-year-old South Korean counterpart during the limousine drive from the airport to the capital . Clasping Kim Dae Jung 's hands in a surprisingly touching show of warmth , he told the President , " I hope you stay here comfortably . " <P> If there was one thing that most Korea watchers felt they knew for sure , it was that the comfort of a South Korean President was not on the list of things Kim Jong Il cared about . But that was the old Kim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Part spin , part smarts and all opportunism , Kim 2.0 is an impressive creation , an example of a 180-degree image shift that was achieved in near Internet time  --  hardly something anyone would have expected from Pyongyang , where cell phones are as uncommon as Cokes . <P> But that 's precisely what the world got  --  much to the astonishment of the White House , which just weeks ago had been using Kim as Example A of a " rogue dictator " while trying to convince Russia of the value of a missile-defense shield . It 's too early to be sure that the new Kim is for real . The makeover , though , does seem to have legs . It 's not really that Kim is such a different guy  --  his charmingly opportunistic streak once helped him extort billions from foreign governments in exchange for capping his nukes program . It 's that his interests  --  and the world around him  --  have changed for good .                  @ @ @
