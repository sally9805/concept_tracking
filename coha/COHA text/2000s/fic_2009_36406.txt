Book One <br> 1 . <br> Isaac 's mother was dead five years but he had n't stopped thinking about her . He lived alone in the house with the old man , twenty , small for his age , easily mistaken for a boy . Late morning and he walked quickly through the woods toward town -- a small thin figure with a backpack , trying hard to keep out of sight . He 'd taken four thousand dollars from the old man 's desk ; Stolen , he corrected himself . The nuthouse prisonbreak . Anyone sees you and it 's Silas get the dogs . <br> Soon he reached the overlook : green rolling hills , a muddy winding river , an expanse of forest unbroken except for the town of Buell and its steelmill . The mill itself had been like a small city , but they had closed it in 1987 , partially dismantled it ten years later ; it now stood like an ancient ruin , its buildings grown over with bittersweet vine , devil 's tear thumb , and tree of heaven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was only the occasional human squatter . <br> Still , it was a quaint town : neat rows of white houses wrapping the hillside , church steeples and cobblestone streets , the tall silver domes of an Orthodox cathedral . A place that had recently been well-off , its downtown full of historic stone buildings , mostly boarded now . On certain blocks there was still a pretense of keeping the trash picked up , but others had been abandoned completely . Buell , Fayette County , Pennsylvania . Fayette-nam , as it was often called . <br> Isaac walked the railroad tracks to avoid being seen , though there were n't many people out anyway . He could remember the streets at shiftchange , the traffic stopped , the flood of men emerging from the billet mill coated with steeldust and flickering in the sunlight ; his father , tall and shimmering , reaching down to lift him . That was before the accident . Before he became the old man . <br> It was forty miles to Pittsburgh and the best way was to follow the tracks along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride as long as you wanted . Once he made the city , he 'd jump another train to California . He 'd been planning this for a month . A long time overdue . Think Poe will come along ? Probably not . <br> On the river he watched barges and a towboat pass , engines droning . It was pushing coal . Once the boat was gone the air got quiet and the water was slow and muddy and the forests ran down to the edge and it could have been anywhere , the Amazon , a picture from National Geographic . A bluegill jumped in the shallows -- you were n't supposed to eat the fish but everyone did . Mercury and PCB . He could n't remember what the letters stood for but it was poison . <br> In school he 'd tutored Poe in math , though even now he was n't sure why Poe was friends with him -- Isaac English and his older sister were the two smartest kids in town , the whole Valley , probably ; the sister had gone to Yale . A rising tide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . He 'd looked up to his sister most of his life , but she had found a new place , had a husband in Connecticut that neither Isaac nor his father had met . You 're doing fine alone , he thought . The kid needs to be less bitter . Soon he 'll hit California -- easy winters and the warmth of his own desert . A year to get residency and apply to school : astrophysics . Lawrence Livermore . Keck Observatory and the Very Large Array . Listen to yourself -- does any of that still make sense ? <br> Outside the town it got rural again and he decided to walk the trails to Poe 's house instead of taking the road . He climbed steadily along . He knew the woods as well as an old poacher , kept notebooks of drawings he 'd made of birds and other animals , though mostly it was birds . Half the weight of his pack was notebooks . He liked being outside . He wondered if that was because there were no people , but he hoped not . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a city , he did n't know , his mind was like a train where you could n't control the speed . Give it a track and direction or it cracks up . The human condition put names to everything : bloodroot rockflower whip-poor-will , tulip bitternut hackberry . Shagbark and pin oak . Locust and kingnut . Plenty to keep your mind busy . <br> Meanwhile , right over your head , a thin blue sky , see clear to outer space : the last great mystery . Same distance to Pittsburgh -- couple miles of air and then four hundred below zero , a fragile blanket . Pure luck . Odds are you should n't be alive -- think about that , Watson . Ca n't say it in public or they 'll put you in a straitjacket . <br> Except eventually the luck runs out -- your sun turns into a red giant and the earth is burned whole . Giveth and taketh away . The entire human race would have to move before that happened and only the physicists could figure out how , they were the ones who would save people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But at least he 'd have made his contribution . Being dead did n't excuse your responsibility to the ones still alive . If there was anything he was sure of , it was that . <br> Poe lived at the top of a dirt road in a doublewide trailer that sat , like many houses outside town , on a large tract of woodland . Eighty acres , in this case , a frontier sort of feeling , a feeling of being the last man on earth , protected by all the green hills and hollows . <br> There was a muddy four-wheeler sitting in the yard near Poe 's old Camaro , its three-thousand-dollar paintjob and blown transmission . Metal sheds in various states of collapse , a Number 3 Dale Earnhardt flag pinned across one of them , a wooden game pole for hanging deer . Poe was sitting at the top of the hill , looking out toward the river from his folding chair . If you could find a way to pay your mortgage , people always said , it was like living on God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go to college to keep playing ball , not exactly Big Ten material but good enough for somewhere , only two years later here he was , living in his mother 's trailer , sitting in the yard and looking like he intended to cut firewood . This week or maybe next . A year older than Isaac , his glory days already past , a dozen empty beer cans at his feet . He was tall and broad and squareheaded and at two hundred forty pounds , more than twice the size of Isaac . When he saw him , Poe said : <br> " Getting rid of you for good , huh ? " <br> " Hide your tears , " Isaac told him . He looked around . " Where 's your bag ? " It was a relief to see Poe , a distraction from the stolen money in his pocket . <br> Poe grinned and sipped his beer . He had n't showered in days -- he 'd been laid off when the town hardware store cut its hours and was putting off applying to Wal-Mart as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along , you know I 've got all this stuff to take care of . " He waved his arm generally at the rolling hills and woods in the distance . " No time for your little caper . " <br> " You really are a coward , are n't you ? " <br> " Christ , Mental , you ca n't seriously want me to come with you . " <br> " I do n't care either way , " Isaac told him . <br> " Looking at it from my own selfish point of view , I 'm still on goddamn probation . I 'm better off robbing gas stations . " <br> " Sure you are . " <br> " You ai n't gon na make me feel guilty . Drink a beer and sit down a minute . " <br> " I do n't have time , " said Isaac . <br> Poe glanced around the yard in exasperation , but finally he stood up . He finished the rest of his drink and crumpled the can . " Alright , " he said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city . But after that , you 're on your own . " <br> From a distance , from the size of them , they might have been father and son . Poe with his big jaw and his small eyes and even now , two years out of school , a nylon football jacket , his name and player number on the front and buell eagles on the back . Isaac short and skinny , his eyes too large for his face , his clothes too large for him as well , his old backpack stuffed with his sleeping bag , a change of clothes , his notebooks . They went down the narrow dirt road toward the river , mostly it was woods and meadows , green and beautiful in the first weeks of spring . They passed an old house that had tipped face-first into a sinkhole -- the ground in the Mid-Mon Valley was riddled with old coal mines , some properly stabilized , others not . Isaac winged a rock and knocked a ventstack off the roof . He 'd always had a good arm , better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never admit it . <br> Just before the river they came to the Cultrap farm with its cows sitting in the sun , heard a pig squeal for a long time in one of the outbuildings . <br> " Wish I had n't heard that . " <br> " Shit , " said Poe . " Cultrap makes the best bacon around . " <br> " It 's still something dying . " <br> " Maybe you should stop analyzing it . " <br> " You know they use pig hearts to fix human hearts . The valves are basically the same . " <br> " I 'm gon na miss your factoids . " <br> " Sure you will . " <br> " I was exaggerating , " said Poe . " I was being ironic . " <br> They continued to walk . <br> " You know I would seriously owe you if you came with . " <br> " Me and Jack Kerouac Junior . Who stole four grand from his old man and does n't even know where the money came from . " <br> " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's got plenty of money now that he 's not sending it all to my sister . " <br> " Who probably needed it . " <br> " Who graduated from Yale with about ten scholarships while I stayed back and looked after Little Hitler . " <br> Poe sighed . " Poor angry Isaac . " <br> " Who would n't be ? " <br> " Well to share some wisdom from my own father , wherever you go , you still wake up and see the same face in the mirror . " <br> " Words to live by . " <br> " The old man 's been around some . " <br> " You 're right about that . " <br> " Come on now , Mental . " <br> They turned north along the river , toward Pittsburgh ; to the south it was state forest and coal mines . The coal was the reason for steel . They passed another old plant and its smokestack , it was n't just steel , there were dozens of smaller industries that supported the mills and were supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mining equipment , the list went on . It had been an intricate system and when the mills shut down , the entire Valley had collapsed . Steel had been the heart . He wondered how long it would be before it all rusted away to nothing and the Valley returned to a primitive state . Only the stone would last . <br> For a hundred years the Valley had been the center of steel production in the country , in the entire world , technically , but in the time since Poe and Isaac were born , the area had lost 150,000 jobs -- most of the towns could no longer afford basic services ; many no longer had any police . As Isaac had overheard his sister tell someone from college : half the people went on welfare and the other half went back to hunting and gathering . Which was an exaggeration , but not by much . <br> There was no sign of any train and Poe was walking a step ahead , there was only the sound of the wind coming off the river and the gravel crunching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which all the bends in the river would keep slow . The shorter trains ran a lot faster ; it was dangerous to try to catch them . <br> He looked out over the river , the muddiness of it , the things buried underneath . Different layers and all kinds of old crap buried in the muck , tractor parts and dinosaur bones . You are n't at the bottom but you are n't exactly at the surface , either . You are having a hard time seeing things . Hence the February swim . Hence the ripping off the old man . Feels like days since you 've been home but it has probably only been two or three hours ; you can still go back . No . Plenty of things worse than stealing , lying to yourself for example , your sister and the old man being champions in that . Acting like the last living souls . <br> Whereas you yourself take after your mother . Stick around and you 're bound for the nuthouse . Embalming table . Stroll on the ice in February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could barely breathe but you stayed until it stopped hurting , that was how she slipped in . Take it for a minute and you start to go warm . A life lesson . You would not have risen until now -- April -- the river gets warmer and the things that live inside you , quietly without you knowing it , it is them that make you rise . The teacher taught you that . Dead deer in winter look like bones , though in summer they swell their skins . Bacteria . Cold keeps them down but they get you in the end . <br> You 're doing fine , he thought . Snap out of it . <br> But of course he could remember Poe dragging him out of the water , telling Poe I wanted to see what it felt like is all . Simple experiment . Then he was under the trees , it was dark and he was running , mud-covered , crashing through deadfall and fernbeds , there was a rushing in his ears and he came out in someone 's field . Dead leaves crackling ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . He knew he was at the end . But Poe had caught up to him again . <br> " Sorry what I said about your dad , " he told Poe now . <br> " I do n't give a shit , " said Poe . <br> " We gon na keep walking like this ? " <br> " Like what ? " <br> " Not talking . " <br> " Maybe I 'm just being sad . " <br> " Maybe you need to man up a little . " Isaac grinned but Poe stayed serious . <br> " Some of us have their whole lives ahead of them . Others --  " <br> " You can do whatever you want . " <br> " Lay off it , " said Poe . <br> Isaac let him walk ahead . The wind was picking up and snapping their clothes . <br> " You good to keep going if this storm comes in ? " <br> " Not really , " said Poe . <br> " There 's an old plant up there once we get out of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in there . " <br> Continues ...
