Over the past few years , President George W. Bush has demonstrated a staunch unwillingness to compromise with the Democrats  --  except when it comes to their worst ideas . He caved on school vouchers , even though his limited plan might have provided a needed jolt of creative competition in the poorest neighborhoods . And last week he indulged the Democrats  --  along with the powerful AARP and other selfish senior lobbyists  --  on prescription drugs for the elderly . <P> The Senate Finance Committee , once one of the few responsible congressional outposts , opened the bidding with a $400 billion proposal over 10 years . This just weeks after Congress passed a $350 billion tax cut that may well cost $800 billion to $1 trillion when its accounting tricks are untangled . And this in a year when a $400 billion federal budget deficit is predicted , along with many more deficit zeros in the years to come . <P> The Senate prescription-drug plan is yet another slovenly bit of business . Here 's how it works : You pay a $35-a-month premium . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your drug bills up to $4,500 . Then it stops . Then it starts again if you pay more than $5,800 a year . In other words , a senseless stop-and-go ladder system that applies to all Medicare recipients regardless of income . And its bottom line ? You have to spend $1,200 in premiums and deductibles and co-pays before the government spends $1,201 . About 35% of seniors would pay in more than they get back . Another curious feature : the program does n't start until 2006 . So why the rush to pass it now ? Could it be the 2004 election ? The Democrats have been boggled by Bush once again . They will have the sour satisfaction of getting their wish  --  prescription drugs for the elderly  --  while granting the President a domestic-policy triumph to equal his airborne landing on the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln . <P> Until last week the Republicans were more responsible than the Democrats on the prescription-drug issue . In 2000 Bush favored a plan that would help only the seniors who needed it most  --  the poorest , those who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More recently the Republicans hoped to use a prescription-drug benefit as an inducement to seniors who agreed to leave Medicare 's archaic , expensive fee-for-service system and join a managed-care group . The Democrats demagogued this as " herding the elderly into HMOs . " Actually , the Republicans were hoping to impose some structure on a runaway program whose costs will explode when the baby boomers retire  --  and they were proposing only that the elderly receive the same sort of ( managed ) care that most nonelderly Americans do . Those were the principles Bush abandoned last week . And the Republicans are complicit in another accounting fraud . The obvious defects in the Senate bill will be fixed sometime before 2006  --  you can bet no seniors will ever pay more into the prescription-drug plan than they take out  --  but not this year . The ultimate cost will be  --  What , $700 billion ? $1 trillion ?
