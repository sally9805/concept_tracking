HANDLE WITH CARE // The curse of the billy goat did n't get Cubs righthander Mark Prior . The curse of too much work too soon did . And the Cubs ' Carlos Zambrano and the Marlins ' Dontrelle Willis better watch out . They could be next . // Nothing puts a young pitcher at risk quite like severely increasing his workload when his body and arm are still developing . Most clubs , including the A 's , the Mets and the Rangers , do n't want their young pitchers to increase their innings by more than 30 in one year . // Becoming a 200-inning big league pitcher is like becoming a marathoner or a powerlifter . You need to build to that level incrementally , not by large jumps in workload . Proper development , however , often gets thrown aside once a pitcher gets to the cold business of the major leagues  --  where innings are most difficult and stressful. // Any team that heaps a 40-inning increase on a young pitcher is asking for trouble . That trouble usually shows up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over the last five seasons I tracked 24 pitchers age 25 and under who logged a 40-inning jump from the previous season or their previous professional high . Nine of them wound up on the DL the next year , including Prior , 23 , who has elbow and Achilles tendon injuries this season after a 67-inning jump ( including 23 ? postseason innings ) in ' 03. // Because of the stress placed on their arms last year , Zambrano ( +72 ? innings at age 22 ) and Willis ( +52 at 21 ) , though off to good starts , are also at risk-at least for a drop-off this season . Seventeen of the previous 21 overworked young pitchers had a worse ERA the year after . They include Tony Armas Jr. , Ryan Dempster , Kevin Millwood and Odalis Perez . // No team has treated young starters worse than the Royals . Since 2000 they have blown out the arms of Mac Suzuki ( +78 ? ) , Chad Durbin ( +61 ) , Chris George ( +49 ? ) and Runelvys Hernandez ( +92 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no business pushing Jeremy Affeldt , 24 , and prize prospect Zack Greinke , 20 , close to the 200-inning mark this year . Affeldt , the most talented pitcher in the Royals ' rotation , has never thrown more than 147 ? innings in a season ; Greinke threw a personal-high 140 last year when he was a combined 15-4 with a 1.93 ERA in Class A and Double A. // Likewise , the Mets are crazy if they expect Tyler Yates to spend the entire year in their rotation . Though Yates turned 26 last August , he has never pitched more than 107 ? innings in a season . // It takes great restraint to shut down a young , healthy pitcher as a precautionary measure . Detroit did it last year with Jeremy Bonderman , 21 , and Texas did it with Juan Dominguez , 23 . It may also require a team 's absence from a pennant race . Clubs with a shot at playing in October are more likely to push their young pitchers , even if they know the bill may come due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
