1 The captain punched in a number and held the phone to his ear . He looked out over Biscayne Bay , which was choppy , toward the sky over the Atlantic , which was dark . " What , " said a voice in the phone . " It 's me , " said the captain . " Yeah ? " " Have you looked out the window ? " said the captain . " What about it ? " " It 's getting worse , " said the captain . " It 's a tropical storm now . Tropical Storm Hector . They 're forecasting ... " " I do n't give a rat 's ass what they 're forecasting . I do n't care if it 's Hurricane Shaquille O'Neal , you understand ? I told you that last night . " " I know , " said the captain , " but I 'm just wondering if we could do this another ... " " No .

" " That 's where you 're wrong , " said the captain . " If we go out , we got customers . These people , they 're crazy . They do n't care about weather , they do n't care about anything . They just want to get out there . " " Then we 're giving them what they want . " " I do n't like it , " said the captain . " I mean , it 's my ship ; I 'm responsible . " " Number one , it ai n't your boat . Number two , you wan na keep working , you do what I tell you . " The captain gripped the phone , but said nothing . " Besides , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the captain thought : So was the Titanic . Wally Hartley awoke to the sound of his mother 's knock , followed by the sound of his mother 's voice through the bedroom door . " Wally , " she said , " it 's your mother . " She always told him this , as if somehow , during the night , he might have forgotten . " Hi Mom , " he said , trying not to sound tired and annoyed , both of which he was . He looked at the clock radio . It was 8:15 A.M. Wally had gone to bed at 5 A.M. The door opened . Wally squinted his eyes against the light , saw his mom in the doorway . She was dressed and had fixed her hair , as if she had somewhere to go , which she never did , unless you counted the supermarket . She 'd gotten up , as always , at 5:30 . " Did you want some waffles ? " she asked . " No thanks , Mom , " he said , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperation , at age 29-29 , for God 's sake-moved back in with his mother . Wally did not eat breakfast , but he had given up on trying to explain this to his mother . She 'd gotten it into her head that she would make waffles for her son . She was not one to give up easily . " Are you sure ? " she asked . " I 'm sure , Mom , " he said . " Thanks . " Wally waited for her to tell him that she had made some fresh . " I made some fresh , " she said . " Mom , thanks , but really , no . " Now it was time for her to tell him that she hated to see them go to waste . " I hate to see them go to waste , " she said . " I 'm sorry , Mom , " said Wally , because it would do no good to yell , IF YOU DO N'T WANT TO WASTE THE DAMN WAFFLES , THEN DO N'T MAKE THE DAMN WAFFLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll save them for later , in case . " And she would . She would wrap them in aluminum foil and put them in the refrigerator . Later today , when she was cleaning the kitchen for the fourth time , she would take them out of the refrigerator , throw them away , fold the aluminum foil ( she had pieces of aluminum foil dating back to the first Bush administration ) , and save it in a drawer , for tomorrow 's waffles . " I 'm sorry , Mom , " said Wally , again . She sniffed the air in his room . Wally hated that , his mom sniffing his room , his b.o . " It smells musty in here , " she said . Everything always smelled musty to his mother ; everything looked dirty . Show her Michelangelo 's David , and she 'd want to get after it with some Spic and Span . " It 's fine , Mom , " he said . " I 'm gon na vacuum in here , " she said . She vacuumed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She also did his laundry and straightened up his belongings . She folded his underwear . Wally had to keep his pot in his car , or she 'd find it . " Mom , you do n't need to clean my room , " he said . " It has a musty smell , " she said . " I 'm gon na vacuum . " Wally lay back on his bed and closed his eyes , hoping his mom would close the door , let him drift back to sleep . But no , she 'd been up for more than two hours , and she 'd had two cups of coffee , and there was nobody else for her to talk to , and Regis did not come on for another hour . It was time for the weather report . " Bob Soper said there 's a storm coming , " she said . Bob Soper was a Miami TV weatherman , her favorite . She 'd seen him at the Publix supermarket on Miami Beach once , at the deli counter , and she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historic event-he could n't have been nicer . This was one of the highlights of her life since her husband , Wally 's father , had died . " Tropical Storm Hector , " she said . " Bob Soper said it could be fifty-five-mile-an-hour winds . Very rough seas , he said . " " Huh , " said Wally , keeping his eyes closed . " So the boat wo n't go out , right ? " she said . " You wo n't go out in that ? " " I du n no , Mom , " Wally said . " Probably not . I have to call . But not now . I 'm gon na sleep some more now , OK ? I got in kind of late . " He turned his body away from the light , from his mother 's silhouette . " Fifty-five miles an hour , " she said . " They wo n't go out in that . " Wally said nothing . " I saw him at Publix that time , " she said . " Bob Soper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deli , waiting just like everybody else , " she said . " He could n't have been nicer . " Wally said nothing . " He got the honey-baked ham , a half pound , " she said . " Boar 's Head . " Wally said nothing . Ten seconds passed ; he could feel her standing there . " I just thought you might want some waffles , " she said . Another ten seconds . " I 'm definitely gon na vacuum in here , " she said , and closed the door . Wally , now totally awake , rolled onto his back , stared at the ceiling , and thought , as he did pretty much every waking minute that he spent in his mother 's house , I have got to get out of here . He willed his brain to think about how he was going to get out of there , and his brain , having been through this many times , responded with : despair . Wally was broke . His only assets , other than his clothes , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe $800 if he sold it , which he never would ; and his car , a 1986 Nissan Sentra that ran but was probably not salable , as its body was riddled with some kind of car leprosy . As a professional musician , Wally was currently making $50 a day , playing with the band on the ship , but that was only on days that the ship went out , and that money was usually gone within hours for the necessities of Wally 's life : food , gas , a cell phone , and pot . Wally was more than $5,000 in debt to three credit-card companies ; he did not know the exact amount , because he threw the statements away without opening them . Wally had gotten the credit cards a few months earlier when he 'd gotten his first-ever real day job , a short-lived attempt to leave the gig-to-gig life of the bar musician . He 'd gotten the job through his fiance , Amanda , who had grown tired of paying most of the rent on the apartment they shared . Amanda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No offense , " she 'd said one night , " but I do n't want to spend the rest of my life sitting at the bar getting hit on by creeps and listening to you play ' Brown Eyed Girl . ' " " I thought you liked ' Brown Eyed Girl , ' " Wally said . " I did , " she said , " the first three million times . " " You think we need some new songs ? " he said . " I think you need a new job , " she said . Lately this had become the theme of many of their conversations . " You 're almost thirty years old , " Amanda said . " How 're we supposed to get married on what you make ? How 're we supposed to raise a family if you 're out all night all the time ? Do you even want to get married ? " " Of course I want to get married , " said Wally , who was not one million percent sure , but also was not stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band , I mean , those guys are my best friends . We 've been through a lot . " " You 've been through a lot of pot , is what you 've been through , " she said . This had also become a theme . She used to happily partake in the doobie-passing back when they started dating , when she liked the idea that her guy was a musician , an artist . But she did n't smoke weed anymore , did n't even drink beer . When she came to gigs , which she did less and less often , she drank Perrier and looked bored . " What do you want me to do ? " Wally asked her . He really meant it . She was changing , and he was n't , and he did n't want to lose her , and it scared him that he did n't know what she wanted any more . " Do you love me ? " she asked . " Yes , " he said . " Of course I love you . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and I do n't want to lose her . " Then talk to Tom about the job , " she said . " OK , " said Wally . " I 'll talk to Tom . " Tom was Tom Recker , Amanda 's new boss , who was starting a new company and was hiring . He 'd hired Amanda away from her job as a secretary in a law firm to be his administrative assistant . As far as Wally could tell , administrative assistant was the same thing as secretary , but with more syllables . Recker was 26 and had an MBA from Wharton , which he would let you know if you gave him an opening . He lifted weights and Rollerbladed and-although he did not tell people this-believed he looked like Keanu Reeves . His company was called Recker International ; he was financing the startup ( Amanda confided this to Wally ) with $3 million he got from his father . Wally 's job interview consisted mostly of a lengthy explanation by Recker of what a great concept Recker International was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't understand it because every other sentence Recker said had " paradigm " in it . Later on , Wally looked " paradigm " up in the dictionary , but that had not helped . The actual interview part of the interview had been brief . " So , " Recker said . " Mandy tells me you play the guitar . " " Yeah , " said Wally , thinking , Mandy ? " She says you 're in a band , " said Recker . " Yeah , " said Wally . " What kind of music do you play ? " asked Recker . " Mostly covers , " said Wally , " but we try to ... " Recker interrupted . " I used to fool around with the guitar , " he said . " Huh , " said Wally . Sometimes it seemed like everybody he met used to fool around with the guitar . " Tell you the truth , I was n't bad , " said Recker , making an air-guitar move that told Wally , in an instant , that Recker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with it , but I 'm trying to run a business here . Not much time for fun , I 'm afraid . Somebody 's got to be the grownup . " Right , with Daddy 's money , thought Wally . " You have any business experience , Wally ? " asked Recker . " Well , " said Wally , " I handle the bookings for the band . " Recker laughed out loud at that-a hearty , Wharton-man laugh . " That 's not exactly the kind of experience I 'm looking for , " he said , still chuckling at the thought-bookings for the band ! " but I 'm going to take a chance on you . " He leaned forward and pressed his fingertips together , a 26-year-old Rollerblader talking to Wally like he was Wally 's dad . " Mandy tells me you 're a fast learner and a self-starter . Is that true , Wally ? Would you call yourself a self-starter ? " " Yes , Tom , I would , " said Wally , who , as Amanda well knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P.M. " Welcome to the Recker International team , " said Recker , reaching across his new desk to give Wally a manly handshake . " Thanks , " said Wally . " Hey , " said Recker , still shaking Wally 's hand , gripping it a little too hard , " maybe you can bring your guitar and entertain us at the Christmas party , ha ha . " " Ha ha , " said Wally . Asshole . And so Wally quit his band and joined Recker International , where his job title was assistant systems technician . What this meant was that he unpacked desktop computers and then helped the systems technician try , with sporadic success , to hook these up into a network . As far as Wally could tell , it did n't really matter whether the computers worked or not , because the other members of the Recker International team seemed to have no clear idea what they were doing . There was much wandering from cubicle to cubicle , long meetings about designing the web site , and a lot of talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that seemed like actual work . Except for Amanda . She was working all the time , many nights late , sometimes really late . He asked her what was going on , and she said a lot of things , and he asked her what kind of things , and she said complicated business financial stuff that she was too tired to talk about . He said he thought Recker was taking advantage of her , and she got mad and said she wanted to be part of this , this was important , this was going to be big , and Wally should be grateful to be part of a company run by somebody like Tommy , because he had vision . And Wally thought , Tommy ? One night , out of loneliness , Wally went to a bar where his ex-bandmates were playing . Wally was pleased to note that the guitar player they 'd replaced him with was n't particularly good . During the breaks , his old bandmates sat at his table and gave him a hard time about being a corporate sellout . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two breaks and some beers later , he told them what was going on with Amanda . They listened sympathetically-these were Wally 's oldest and best friends-then assured him that Amanda 's new boss was definitely porking her . Wally understood that they were just busting his balls . But when he left the bar , he drove to the Recker International offices . He let himself in with his security card and closed the door quietly . It was dark in the lobby and in the main cubicle area . Recker 's office door was closed ; there was light shining through the bottom crack . Wally could hear talking in there , then silence for a while , then more talking . He decided the talking was a good sign . He thought about leaving , but instead went to a corner cubicle and sat down . He was there almost an hour , not really thinking about anything , suspended in a pure state of waiting . Finally , Recker 's office door opened . Amanda walked out , holding her purse . Recker was behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some papers . They 'd been working . " Thanks for tonight , " Recker said . " See you tomorrow . " " OK , " said Amanda . " I 'm afraid it 's gon na be another long one , " Recker said . " We got that stupid brokerage thing to deal with . " " I 'll be here , " said Amanda , and turned toward the lobby . She was working late on financial stuff , just like she said , you jealous moron . You faithless jerk . You do n't deserve her . Wally shrunk down in the chair , praying they would n't notice him , off in the corner , in the dark . Amanda took a few steps . " Hey , Mandy , " said Recker . She stopped . Wally 's heart stopped . " Come here , " said Recker . And she turned and went to him , and in a second they were locked together , mouth on mouth , and Wally knew this was not the first time . Recker reached down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she moaned . Wally moaned , too , but they did n't hear him , as they slid to the floor , groping each other frantically . Nor did they see Wally stand up , take a step toward them , then turn and walk out of the office , eyes burning , trying to get his mind around the fact that he had no fiance , and no job , and nowhere to live . A few hours later , he showed up at his mom 's house , the house he grew up in , with all his stuff , which was n't much , piled randomly into his Sentra . It was still dark , but his mom was up already . " Mom , " he said , " I need to stay here for a while . " His mom looked at him for a moment . " I 'll make you some waffles , " she said .
