Her Scandalous Marriage By LaFoy , Leslie St. Martin 's Paperbacks LaFoy , Leslie Caroline stopped fiddling with the draping of a gown and watched as the black vehicle rolled to a stop in front of her shop . A town coach that fancy did n't belong in this part of London . God only knew why the man climbing out of it was studying her sign , but his pinched nose and curled upper lip clearly indicated his disdain . Proving , Caroline decided , that some days were doomed from the moment you opened your eyes in the morning . Mrs. Hobson had been waiting for her to open so she could change her mind about the fabric for her walking outfit -- -for the third time that week . Mrs. Ferrell had come in on her heels to complain about a side seam that had n't withstood , much less contained , what had to have been , at the very least , a thirty-pound weight gain . She 'd no more than stomped out when Mrs. Smythe had sashayed in with all four of her daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear to a cousin 's wedding next week . Caroline had seen poodles less pampered than the Smythe girls . And less inclined to bite . Now . . . Well , if the stranger ever stopped scowling , he 'd be an incredibly handsome man . Tall , dark haired , pleasingly chiseled jaw and well defined , rather high cheekbones . Not young , but not middle-aged yet , either . He had long , straight legs , a narrow waist , and a well-proportioned chest and broad shoulders . Inshort , he was a tailor 's dream walking about in custom leather boots . And obviously there was a grateful tailor somewhere because the suit the man was wearing was well made out of a very fine -- -very expensive -- -wool cloth . Given the quality of the suit , the hat he wore was most likely made of the finest beaver . Yes , all in all , the man coming through her shop door was a man of means and good taste , a man who moved with a natural grace and power . " Good afternoon , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the threshold and removed his hat . " How may I be of assistance ? " " You might summon the owner of this establishment . " His voice would be very rich and deep and pleasant if the haughty edge to it could be chipped away . " I 'm the owner , " she supplied , thinking that he had the most kissable mouth she 'd ever seen . What would he taste like ? She wondered ? What flavor was carnal delight ? " You are Miss Caroline Dutton ? " He knew her name ? Good Lord , had Wilamina Ferrell been serious when she 'd threatened to contact her solicitor ? " Yes , " Caroline admitted , her heart thumping . " How may I be of assistance to you , sir ? " " I am Drayton Mackenzie , Duke of Ryland . " Ryland ? Well , that said volumes . Her heart settled back to a normal beat . " And you are here because . . . ? " she asked coolly . " Because I am cursed . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she countered as she went back to adjusting the pins on the dress of the eldest Symthe poodle . " But I have heard of a woman in Whitehall who will cast and remove spells for a bottle of gin . " " I 've been cursed by your father . " " Have n't we all , " she quipped , tweaking the fabric and then leaning back to study the effects of the change . " From the grave . " Why did n't she find that surprising ? Why did she care enough to even wonder ? " I must admit that I 'm impressed . " " I am not here to impress you , madam . " That I'm-better-than-you manner of his was really insufferable . She glanced over at him . No , no one appeared to have broken his nose for it . Unfortunately . " Good , because you have n't impressed me at all . " At least not favorably in any sense other than the purely physical , she silently added . Carrying the dress through the curtain that separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referring to the awe inspired by my late father 's ability to make people dance to his tune despite his passage to the Great Beyond . " Drayton clenched his teeth and watched the curtain settle into place behind her . Yes , dear old Cousin Geoffrey had been one of the best at pulling strings . Damn him . As though it were n't bad enough that Geoffrey had played people as puppets while he lived , he 'd transferred the paddles to a barrister at his death so the manipulation could continue for the next decade . Maybe even longer , God forbid . Not that it was going to be hellishly difficult to meet the requirements where Caroline Dutton was concerned . She was pretty . She was tall and she was breathtakingly shapely . Add in flawless , fair skin , honey blond hair , strikingly blue eyes , and a deliciously saucy defiance . . . He did n't have the slightest doubt of her ability to turn male heads wherever she went . And the hopes and fantasies she stirred when she did . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a mistress of her . No , he was mandated to make a regal , untouchable lady out of her and then hand her off to the highest , most deluded bidder . What a waste of a naturally seductive female . But since Geoffrey had discreed and the law was prepared to enforce it . . . When she came back into the showroom , he said , " Let me begin again . " At her glance , he charged forward into the matter from the top . " I am here to discharge the duties attached to the inheritance of your late father 's estate . " " Ah , I see , " she said , as she went about straightening the chairs and footstools . " You see what ? " " Why you 've come to a place so obviously beneath a person of your importance , " she answered . " You were compelled to do so by the lure of a fortune . " His importance ? Ha ! " I am not unfamiliar with environs such as this . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He blinked and barely resisted the urge to lift his hand to his mouth . " Pardon ? " he asked , more irritated by her dismissive manner than he was interested or mystified . " Your upper lip , " she repeated , picking up a basket and checking the contents . " When you climbed from your carriage , it tried to crawl up your nose . " Drayton tried to suppress the shudder and largely failed . If Geoffrey had n't been dead , he 'd have killed him . " If , " he said crisply , determined to take the situation firmly in hand , " I might have your complete attention . " She sighed heavily , closed the lid of the damn basket , and looked at him . " Do go on , " she instructed tightly . " And then do go on your way . " Her eyes darkened considerably when she was angry . At the moment , they were terribly close to the color of a well-blued gun barrel . And they were fixed on him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slow breath and met her challenge full on , saying , " As your father saw death approaching , he resolved to rectify what he considered the wrongs he 'd done to others over the course of his long life . In addition to making several generous bequests to charities , he set aside funds for the proper maintenance and support of his children . " Her smile was barely civil . " I 'm sure they 're appropriately grateful . What does all this have to do with me ? " " You are his daughter . " " His illegitimate daughter , " she countered icily . " His direct legitimate descendants did not survive to assume the title . " " Or , as they say , they failed to survive him . " Well , yes , that was probably a fair statement . From all that he 'd ever heard , Geoffrey 's expectations of others had been considerably higher than any of those he had ever imposed on himself . " We were distantly related , " Drayton offered , choosing his words carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life . I ca n't say that I came away with the impression of his being a particularly ogreish or deliberately hard-hearted man . " " You 're one meeting ahead of me in the tally , " she said , her voice sounding oddly strained . " What impressions I 've formed of him over the years are from my mother 's life in his wake . Forgive me if I 'm not giddy with the thought of dancing off to the south of France to live a life of carefree abandon with the buckets of money he left behind for me . I know enough of my sire and his tendencies to keep a very firm grasp on reality . And that reality is that , like my mother , I must make my own way . " " I believe I mentioned that he had something of a change of heart at the end of his life . " " Yes , you did , " she allowed , heading for the curtain again , this time with the basket in hand . " You may leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task fulfilled . " The woman was maddening beyond belief ! This should n't have been anywhere near as difficult as she was making it . He followed her through the curtain saying , " Madam , I would appreciate it if you would stop walking away from me while I am talking to you . " Standing at a worktable littered with scraps of fabric and tubes of vellum , she looked over her shoulder at him and arched a brow . " If tossing a bag of coins at you were sufficient , " he declared , " I would have handed the matter off to a solicitor and not made the effort to appear here personally . As a condition of inheritance , your father has charged me with the personal responsibility of seeing you formally recognized as his offspring and situated in an advantageous marriage . " She tilted her head and blinked at him in a manner that was unexpectedly , stunningly coquettish . " What ? " " If tossing a bag -- - " " I heard what you said , " she interrupted , straightening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Quite clearly . My amazement is over the part relating to recognition and the arrangement of a marriage . Why would he suddenly care about such things ? " " I can only deduce that he was motivated by a keen sense of regret . " She arched her brow again and there was a decidedly sarcastic edge to her voice when she said , " Having to give an accounting to Saint Peter undoubtedly figured into it as well . " " Perhaps , " he agreed with a slight shrug . " I ca n't speak to the spiritual beliefs he might have held . Whatever his deeper motives were , the fact is that he intended for you to use his name to secure an elevated station in life and the financial certainty which attends it . " She rolled her eyes . " And how many men of substance are there who would be interested in marrying the twenty-three-year-old bastard daughter of a dead-as-a-doornail peer ? " " You will be amazed . " " The bastard daughter who has spent the last five years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head slightly back and pressed the back of her wrist to her brow . " Oh , gasp , " she whimpered in patently feigned distress . " Trade . " " You would be amazed by what men are willing to overlook in the light of a substantial dowry . " And be willing to give for a taste of you . " I would rather be left alone , thank you . " " Unfortunately , neither of us has a choice in the matter . " She considered him , an odd , almost taunting smile playing at the corners of her mouth . " Do you intend to take me from my shop by force , hold me in chains , and auction me to the highest bidder ? " Well , no , but he could n't afford to admit it . " If need be . " She laughed -- -the sound feathering over his senses -- -and walked past him saying , " And to think that you appear to be such a civilized man . You must be in desperate need of money . " And once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curtain , watching it fall back into place and facing a choice between trotting after her like some damn cocker spaniel or standing his ground with no one to witness or appreciate the show . He scrubbed his hand over his chin , pivoted on his heel , and stepped to the other side of the curtain . " My circumstances are not relevant , " he lied as he crossed the showroom . With the counter between them , he met her gaze squarely and said , " I am required to see you properly wed and settled and I will employ whatever means are necessary to achieve that end . " " Really ? " That one single word , the disdainful , mocking tone of it . . . He reached into his coat pocket , took out his ace , and laid it on the counter in front of her . " And this is ? " she asked even as she picked it up . " Notice from your landlord concerning the sale of this building , " he explained . " Do let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having looked at it . The color of her eyes was like that of a pure blue flame . " He 's sold it to you . And you are fully prepared to increase my rent to an utterly astronomical level if I refuse to play my part in assuaging my dead father 's conscience and securing your claim to his estate . " " That would be it in the proverbial nutshell , " he admitted , nodding . " The rent is now two hundred pounds a month . Payable semiannually , in advance . Which means the sum of twelve hundred pounds is due at the present moment . " He put out his hand , palm up , and added , " In the absence of my business manager , I will , just this once , set aside convention and accept your payment . " Caroline drew a slow , deep breath and considered her possible courses . None of them were pleasant . If she had a bit of chain and a padlock , she could fasten herself to the coal stove in the workroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't and now that he 'd made it a contest of money . . . It was n't a fair fight at all and she knew good and well that she was going to lose in the end . But surrendering without so much as a whimper . . . She lifted her chin . " Please consider this notification of my intent to immediately relocate my business . " " There is the matter of the unpaid balance on this month 's rent , " he countered instantly , apparently having anticipated her plan . " I 'm afraid that I will have to seize your inventory in lieu of that payment . " Of course . A man every bit as ruthless as he was handsome . " Are you a bastard by birth as well as by temperament ? " Anger flashed in the depth of his dark eyes . It did n't , however , show in his voice when he said coolly , smoothly , " Casting aspersions will not alter my course . Or yours . You are the daughter of a duke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duke . Not that it 's mattered one whit until today . " " Ah , " he drawled , as the tiniest of smiles lifted one corner of his mouth . " But today has arrived and your destiny has been forever altered . Please get your wrap and whatever personal items of sentimental value you might wish to bring into your new life . " I have snapped my fingers . Obey . Caroline counted to ten and brought her anger under control . " I ca n't walk out the door right this instant , lock it behind me , and hand you the key . " " Why ever not ? " " This is a business , " she explained tightly . " I have clients to whom I owe goods . They have made deposits and I have made promises . Aside from their disappointment , my professional reputation will be ruined if I simply up and leave . " " Your reputation as a modiste is now . . . pardon the pun . . . immaterial . " " And my assistant ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's to return from her shopping within the next hour or so . What 's she to do when she finds the shop closed and locked ? " " Leave her a note telling her that she 's free to find herself another situation . " " And my personal reputation ? " she demanded , her voice higher pitched than she liked . She paused to swallow and drag in a settling breath . " What of it ? Is there a proper chaperone waiting in your carriage ? " He shrugged . Barely . " Appearances do not matter overly much until such time as society becomes aware of you . Now please gather your belongings . We have much to do yet today and this has already taken far more time than I intended . " Far be it from her to inconvenience him . She folded her arms across her midriff . " And what will you do if I refuse ? " " Your trinkets will be left behind when I sling you over my shoulder and haul you out . " Trinkets . The pompous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she threatened , not caring that she sounded like a peevish child . " The public spectacle would be horribly embarrassing for you . " " Probably so , " he admitted with a full-fledged , heart tripping smile . " Which would mean , of course , that I could never appear in this part of town again . A tragedy I will simply have to bear as best I can . " Oh , to win against him . . . There had to be a way . Simply had to be . Perhaps she could make a pretense of gathering up her things and -- - " Yes , you could easily slip out the rear door while you are collecting your belongings . But please be aware that my footman is waiting there for you . " How he 'd known what she was thinking was a mystery she 'd ponder later . At the moment , she was too frustrated and resentful to see anything except the trap in which she 'd been caught . " You appear to have considered all of my likely reactions . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a nod . " But I must admit to being surprised by your resistance . Why do you feel the need to be such an obstinate creature ? I 'm offering all the stuff of grand , girlish dreams . Wealth , privilege , marriage . What could this . . . " He glanced around her shop and made a weak gesture to encompass it . " What could this place offer you that would be of equal worth ? " Place ? Place ? She gripped the edge of the counter in front of her in a desperate effort to contain her anger . No , her shop was n't a high-priced , self-important salon that decided who they 'd deign to serve and who was n't good enough to darken their door . But neither was it a dark and dingy and sweaty back room where clothes were assembled by women who were slaves in all but legal status . How dare he dismiss her shop as though the efforts to build it had n't amounted to anything . How dare he walk into her life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she and her mother had worked so hard to achieve . " I 'm not a girl , " she replied tautly , inwardly seething . " I 'm a woman , full-grown . I do n't pine to be a wife , to either a rich man or a poor one . As for dreams of castles and houses with names and attending fancy balls in elegant , obscenely expensive gowns . . . My father could n't be bothered with my dreams while he lived , could n't be bothered with me . My dreams died long before he did . As for what this place offers me . . . Independence and protection from the whims of selfish men like my father . Of men like you . " He cocked a brow and tilted his head , studying her for a second as though she were some exotic Egyptian bug in a display case at the museum . " Have you ever heard the expression , cutting off one 's nose to spite one 's face ? " He did n't give her a chance to reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his largesse accomplishes nothing that will make the least bit of difference to him or to anyone else . It will simply ensure that you spend the rest of your life as you have spent the first part it , existing on the margins of respectability and clinging by your fingertips to economic survival . " He was right , of course . Damn him . But there was something so terribly humiliating , so patently desperate about throwing away all the efforts as if they 'd been mere diversions while she waited to become a fairy-tale princess . " Perhaps , " he went on , " it might help to think of acceding as the fulfillment of your late mother 's greatest hopes . " She sucked in a deep breath , furious that he 'd stoop so low , weakened by the realization that her mother would have had her out the door and into his carriage before he 'd even gotten out of it . " And how is it that you know anything of her aspirations ? " she asked , stalling as she tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I said , I am thorough . I came here to take you away by any means necessary . I prefer , of course , to accomplish the task through reason and an appeal to your intelligence and sensibilities . To that end , I made a point of learning all that I could about you and the history of your parents ' relationship . " " Such as it was , " she felt compelled to add testily . " True . " He dredged up a smile that actually seemed slightly apologetic . " Unfortunately , ' brief ' and ' irresponsible ' seem to be the words to characterize all of your late father 's more . . . intimate relations outside his marriage . " " He had others ? " she asked , stunned less by the fact that her mother had n't been the man 's only victim than the fact that she 'd never considered the possibility . He nodded . " Three that produced offspring . There may well have been more , but the other ladies involved did not make claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said softly as Lord Thorough continued his monologue . " I have two siblings . " " Two sisters , " he clarified , looking at her as though she 'd suddenly become another kind of bug entirely . " Collecting them is next on my rather pressing list of tasks to be completed today . So if you could be so reasonable as to abandon your pride and understandable resentment of the past so that we may get on with it all , I would be most appreciative . " Part of her brain recognized that his request was a slightly milder , quieter version of a finger snap . Another part of her brain was whirling with childhood memories . Yet another was cringing at unacceptable possibilities . " Are my sisters older or younger ? " " Younger , " he supplied crisply . " Miss Simone is reportedly fourteen and Miss Fiona only eleven . " Oh , dear God . Babies . They were nothing more than babies . " And do you intend to see them established and married off as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps she was being needlessly concerned for their welfare . It could well be that their families would n't relinquish them . Or at the very least have the resources necessary to check the new duke 's influence and control . " What are their present circumstances ? " she asked . " Let it suffice to say that I do not anticipate any difficulties in acquiring them . " Acquire . As he undoubtedly acquired a new suit . Or a title . Or a mistress . God , fourteen . She remembered being that age . It had been horrible . Part woman , part child . Not sure which would surface in any given situation . Hideously , acutely aware of how her body was changing . Minute by minute , it seemed . And how her new body had changed the way men looked at her and how that had changed , overnight , all the rules for dealing with people . And eleven . . . She remembered that time , too . It had been awful in a different sort of way . Life had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly things in the world at eleven . Not that she 'd understood exactly what they were then , but she 'd sensed the shadows keenly enough that the distraction of old childhood games had started to feel like a dangerous thing . It was when you were n't paying attention that the monsters under the bed would grab your ankles and drag you off to hell . She would n't go back and relive those years for all the money in Christendom , all the tea in China . She 'd gotten through them and past them , but only because her mother had been such a strong and steady presence at her back . If she had n't been there . . . If she 'd been handed into the care of a stranger who issued decrees and saw to her care only because he had to . . . Caroline swallowed away the tickle of tears in her throat and surrendered to the whisper of her conscience . " And where , " she asked , " is it that the three of us will be . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopelessness and the weight of unexpected responsibility . " Ensconced ? Housed ? " he suggested . " I was thinking more along the lines of imprisoned , " she admitted . He ignored her lack of enthusiasm . " The current Season is over and everyone has retired to their country estates . Your father had one , of course , and it was among several properties that passed into my possession at his death . It is my plan that we all take up residence there and spend the coming fall doing whatever is required for young women to be considered socially acceptable . " It did n't bode well that he did n't appear to have any better idea of the specific tasks that lay ahead than she did . But the die had been cast and there was nothing to do but make the best of things . " I 'll accompany you , willingly , on three conditions . " His brow shot up . Warily , he asked , " And they would be ? " Believing that the strength of conviction accomplished far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The first is that you will place my account ledgers into the hands of an able manager to be settled fairly . I wo n't have those who have supported my mother and myself over the years treated shabbily . " " Consider it done . The second condition ? " " My assistant will see that the orders due in the next week are completed and delivered as promised . After that , she 'll join us in the country . " " Why ? " " Do n't ladies have personal maids ? " " Yes . Does she have experience at that sort of thing ? " " No , but then I have no experience at being a lady , so it 's not as though I 'd notice any shortcomings on her part . Either you agree to bring Jane to the country , or I wo n't go . " " What is one more female in a house full of them ? Your third condition ? " " If it becomes apparent that I do n't have the temperament or the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persist in humiliating me . You 'll allow me access to the money my father set aside for bribing a would-be husband so that I can reestablish an independent life for myself . " He narrowed his eyes . " Doing what ? " " The difference between being a modiste and a couturier is the price of the creation , " she explained . " It takes money to make money . With adequate funds , I 'm quite capable of designing and creating with the best in London . In Paris , too , for that matter . " He laughed . The sound was soft , but it was full and deep . More importantly , it brimmed with obviously sincere amusement and eased the knot around her heart . " You certainly do n't lack for confidence , " he observed . " I 'm the daughter of a duke , " Caroline replied . " Nobility is often just as much an attitude as it is the good fortune of being born on the right side of the sheets . Do we have an agreement ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly , almost . . . well , appreciatively . " I want it put into writing . " His brow shot up again . " You do n't trust my word ? " Oh , she liked taking him by surprise . There was something decidedly satisfying in knowing that he did n't have complete control of all the world and everyone and everything in it . " It 's nothing personal , Your Grace , " she assured him , coming around the end of the counter . " It 's simply that the last duke who promised a woman in my family something proved himself a liar . I learned from my mother 's mistake not to trust them any further than I can toss them . " Drayton watched her head toward the curtain , certain that she was walking away just because she knew it irritated him . But since he 'd won the larger battle of wills , he could afford to be magnanimous and let her have her little demonstration of defiance . " I will have my solicitor draw up the papers when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Fair , " she said , disappearing without so much as a glance over her shoulder at him . " I wo n't be but a few moments . " He tilted his head and considered the curtain . If it was all a ruse and she bolted . . . He really should have thought of bringing his footman along to guard the rear door . It was n't as though he had n't inherited one . He had a slew of servants . Enough that he was constantly either tripping over them or bumping into them . At some point he was going to have to learn to think like a nobleman and actually use them . And given the apparent intelligence , willfulness , and self-confidence of Caroline Dutton -- -no , it was Lady Caroline -- -he needed to get his feet under himself as quickly as possible . If he did n't , the charade was going to be blown to tiny , embarrassingly public bits . Continues ... by LaFoy , Leslie               @ @ @ @ @ @
