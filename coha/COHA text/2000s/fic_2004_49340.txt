Jim Young is the author of the novels The Face of the Deep and Armed Memory . A native of Minneapolis , he was a good friend of the late Clifford Simak , although you 'll soon see that his fiction is n't nearly as bucolic as most of Mr. Simak 's work was . In fact , " Ultraviolet Night " directly addresses urban issues that concern the great state of California , a state that should probably be considered the U.S. 's official Science Fiction State now that it 's governed by The Terminator . ( Here 's an exercise for the imagination : what would that Californian Philip K. Dick have made of seeing the star of Total Recall voted into office ! ) After twenty-two years of working in theForeign Service Department ( during which time he served in Botswana , Russia , London , and most recently as the U. S. Coordinator for the Organization for security and Cooperation in Europe ) , Jim retired and moved to-you guessed it-California. he is currently expanding this story into a novel . <p> DO N'T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus Christ , do n't let it be three o'clock . he glanced up at the read-out on the office wall and saw it was 2:54 P.M. Six more minutes to go before the programming drugs started to wear off . And then he 'd lose the edge he needed to fix the problem he 'd just found in the report that was due in Washington at the opening of business tomorrow . Everything the drugs were supposed to keep in check would start bubbling up inside him . just last week , he 'd found himself starting to wonder what effect all of it was having on his family . But so far the programming had always bounced back to remind him that he was , in fact , doing all this for his wife and child - especially for his very sick little boy . Four minutes , he thought as he turned back to the e-mail from the research division . Research had been screwing up the report for days , until now it was due in Washington in only a few hours . At first the e-mailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear exposition of the isolation of the new protein they were hoping the PDA would approve for human trials , and a solid explanation of its effect on the mammalian brain . But there , right near the end , he 'd discovered a brand new mistake they 'd made in redoing the analysis of variance in the animal trials . A brief shiver of dissatisfaction with the research division 's vice president passed through him , but the programming quickly suppressed it . Yet it was clear - this was a big enough mistake to end his career , not to mention everybody else 's at the research division in San Diego . After all , this protein was going to be the bottom line 's mainstay for the next decade - the real reason the new management team had bought the company . And the reason they made you director of research , Wilson , do n't forget that . Once they saw your report suggesting that karatonin could promote responsible behavior in human beings , they grabbed you . And if you do n't get this analysis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trials , and you 'll be looking for a new job . Simple as that . Wilson looked up at the wall again . Now it was nearly half-past four , and he was starting to feel as though he had n't eaten anything for a couple of days - lightheaded and almost feverish . he picked up the phone and called his wife . " Ellen , I 'm afraid I 'm going to be home late tonight . " " Is everything okay ? " She sounded worried . " Oh , we 'll survive . But I 've got to get a report out to the Food and Drug Administration in Washington tonight , and it is n't in any shape to show to them . If we do n't have it in the FDA offices by the time they open tomorrow , then our whole project gets put in limbo for another six months . " " You 've got to , then . " " Um-hmm. " he looked at the clock again . " How 's Jason ? " " Not the worst day we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burdened . " Jason is n't connecting very much today . Not even to music . But , knock wood , he has n't had any big tantrums so far . " " I wish I could be there . " he could hear her breathing and then she said , " Do n't worry , lover . Take care of that report . " " I love you . " " I do , too . " he clicked off the phone and sat back and looked at the ceiling , cracking his knuckles to get the tension out of his system , then gazing out over the rooftop solar panels toward the Pacific and the band of water desalinization pyramids that flanked the coastline of Los Angeles . He did n't dare say anything to anybody , but what he really hoped karatonin could do was overcome autism . What he was hoping for was a software solution to a hardware problem , a cure offered by the discovery that so much of what happened in the body was regulated by proteins rather than genes . Even though there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other primates . Not even the programming could keep him from thinking that there was one primate he would like to cure above everyone else in the world - his profoundly autistic five-year-old , Jason . 2 . Wilson got home late the next night , too . he found Ellen trying to coax Jason to lie down in his crib . Jason was n't having any of it , even though she 'd set the walls to his favorite shade of pink . They got the sleepy-time ambient music going and the bakery smell flowing out of the aromatron , but Jason still wanted to bang his head open against the heavily padded bars of the crib . The sleigh bells on the blue bunny hanging from the headboard jangled with every blow . " It 's bad , " Ellen muttered as she broke open a sedative patch and gently applied it to the back of Jason 's neck , then picked him up in her arms . " Quaternary so contrary , where did your mastodons go ? " Ellen sang as she rocked him . " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It always depressed Wilson to hear his wife extemporize because it reminded him that she 'd given up her musical career to take care of Jason , and he felt he had n't really been able to do much of anything to help . She laid Jason down in his crib . The bunny stopped jingling . Wilson nodded grimly . Afterward , when they were sure Jason was asleep , they stumbled into the living room , sat on the sofa , and stared at the floor while the aromatron whispered , unfolding the scent of a pine forest . Wilson closed his eyes and tried to imagine they were in the High Sierras instead of in an apartment complex that was barely middle class , perched along a mountain in south Chico Hills , only a few minutes away from south L.A. Ellen trembled beside him . he turned and saw her crying silently , reached over and wiped the tears from her cheeks . " Hey - it was n't so bad , " he told her , trying to smile . " Not like last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . " Remember what the doctors say - we 've got to keep trying to get through to him . " He moved closer and hugged her . " I was hoping the tests would show some improvement , too . " Wilson looked at the fireplace image playing on the video wall and thought , You should just be able to take your kid in for a quick genetic modification and make him normal . But the law says no , you ca n't tinker with human genes . Instead , there they were with home treatment and only one income to pay for it . If it had n't been for the anti-gene modification laws .... And then he lost track of what he would do , thinking about the blue bunny . Maybe he should volunteer Jason as a guinea pig , he thought . " I 'm going to do something about autism , someday , Ellen . " " Do n't think about it anymore , lover , " she said . She smiled now , almost genuinely . " It 's hard not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his . Your problem , Wilson thought as he stared at the image of the fireplace , is that you really do n't have the guts to tell her . Better say something , Wilson . " Um , Ellen , listen .... " " I 'm listening . " She looked at him quizzically . " We got the PDA approval today . " Her expression did n't change . " The Food and Drug Administration . They approved the new protein for human trials . " " Oh . Well - that 's - that 's good news . " " And what I 've been thinking is that we ought to see if they 'd let us try it on Jason . It might do him some good . " She squeezed his hand tight . Her fingers were cold . " And you have n't mentioned it before because it 's so risky . Right ? " she asked . He could n't lie . " Yeah . " 3 . In the early morning light , Wilson watched the spaceplane taking off from LAX , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattled toward the ocean . he hardly noticed the sonic boom as he thought about how to broach the question . Around him the commuters bobbed to the ambient soundtracks playing in their earphones , or babbled into their lip-ring phones , psyching up for another battle with the focus groups and power lunches that infested the Pacific Rim . " What d' you think about this nogo zone business ? " an old man said at Wilson 's side . he looked down and saw the speaker was addressing another white-haired retiree wearing a tank-top over a prominent pot belly . " Lunacy , " the second man replied . " And I blame it all on the terrorist attacks back at the turn of the century . Nobody ever needed any programming drugs back then .... " Wilson turned up the volume of his own ambient to shut out their conversation . It helped him focus . Clearly , he told himself , there 's no other way . First thing , right after the morning psych routine , you 've got to go ask the secretariat for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour or so they 'll probably get a memo out from one of the flesh-and-blood managers . Do n't forget , you 're going to need a Plan B if they turn you down , he told himself . Argue that they ca n't reject a volunteer . That ought to get you up to talk to the Entity . Then you can really make your pitch . Because that 's what it 's going to take . The streetcar halted in front of a palm-lined plaza . he got off and strode toward the security checkpoint . The magnetometers scanned him and a simulated voice said , " Good morning , Mr. Wilson . " He smiled stiffly in the direction of the security camera . The Pharos Corporation expected that smile . 4 . Across the wall of the assembly room billowed the image of a smiling , white-haired man , projected as though it were an image on an enormous flag that was waving in the wind . Microdroplets of rose-scented teamazine filtered down over the headquarters staff as they did their morning exercises . Actually , Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was a marvelous thing - a composite of several people . The true make-up of the chief executive Entity was a corporate secret , but Wilson could always pick out three individuals whenever he saw that image : Thomas Edison , Louis Pasteur , and Nikola Tesla . With a shift of the rhythm track , the image of the Entity took on a more three-dimensional quality . The proprietor was about to speak . " My fellow employees , " the Entity said with a nasal twang that ( after years of programming ) always made Wilson feel nostalgic , " This will be a special day for all of us . Keep to the program . " A shout went up and Wilson shouted with it , the teamazine rushing through him . " Keep to the program ! Keep to the program ! " Then one of the senior vice presidents stepped forward on the balcony overlooking the assembly hall , the bald man named Pettimento . He began to sing the company anthem , " Beyond the Blue Horizon , " and the crowd followed along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , and when the song ended his blood was pumping in time to the music . After that , the Entity 's face smiled patriotically and faded from the screen . " This is a proud day to work for the Pharos Corporation . Keep to the program ! " Pettimento cried . " The program ! " the crowd shouted back . Then the lights came up and the ozone generator started clearing the air and the soundtrack shifted to an ambient program - the sound that filled the building during normal working hours . They all hurried off to work . 5 . Wilson spent more than two hours arguing the case before the marketing department for seeking proteins that could counteract Down 's Syndrome . First you develop the means to enhance responsible behavior , then you work on the proteins that increase recall , and that ought to take you down the road to curing the mental aspects of the syndrome . It seemed like the next logical step following the isolation of karatonin . But marketing was n't interested . Could n't understand why they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to have any impact on them , either . After that the teamazine rush had faded . For a brief moment , he had a twinge of doubt about the company 's ability to accomplish anything as he staggered back to his office . Then he remembered there was something else he was supposed to do .... Oh yeah . Jason . Contacting the executive suite took most of the rest of the day . There were a couple of possible routes to an audience with the Entity . Since Wilson 's father had been on the board of directors , one or two of his father 's friends might be willing to help . If they were available . If they were n't on their ambient exercise regimen or golfing or .... Then there was Pettimento , the vice president to whom he reported . Pettimento had known Dad , too , back at Stanford . Sometimes Pettimento even pretended to recall who he was . So Wilson sent a hard copy note to the vice president , asking for an audience with the Entity to decide if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For the good of the program , " Wilson added in handwriting , thinking that struck just the right note of sincerity . Eventually a secretary phoned him to say , " Dr. Pettimento will be able to talk to you at four-thirty . " Wilson was pretty sure she was human ; none of that over-assured simulant about her . Not in the front office . 6 . The screen beeped three times and Pettimento 's long face appeared on Wilson 's screen precisely at four-thirty . " What can I do for you , uh , Tony ? " Pettimento asked . No smile , no hint of the **28;2052;TOOLONG , just a neutral expression and a phony air of bonhomie . Wilson smiled firmly and said , " I was wondering if you 'd consider taking volunteers for the karatonin project . " " Not yourself , I take it ? " Pettimento smirked so artificially that it made Wilson think of the ads challenging the viewer to guess if it was live or Simulex . " Hardly , " Wilson answered . he felt insulted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is the game , he told himself , and you lose by expressing weakness . Without dropping a beat he continued , " I was wondering if my wife and I could volunteer our son for the project . " " A little heinous this afternoon , are n't we ? " Pettimento frowned . " You know , I 'd like to be able to help you out - but we 've got a directive from the front office that says we 're supposed to buck any requests like yours right up to the level of the Entity . " Wilson smiled . " That 's okay with me . " " Tell me what you hope to accomplish with a one-on-one with the Entity . " " Well , it 's like this . My kid is autistic . " Pettimento nodded without diminishing his faint smile . It was clear the vice president had read Wilson 's file . " Here 's my reasoning : enhanced responsibility should limit selfdamaging behavior that occurs with profound autism . My wife and I agreed we ought to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides and he had to swallow , but could n't quite do so . he coughed once instead . " Sorry . " he coughed again . " Like I was saying , we wanted to see if the company would give it a try . " " I 'm sorry to hear about your child 's - problem . " Wilson leaned toward the screen . " Listen , Dr. Pettimento , we 've got to do something . " he almost added that he was going to need time off to help his wife , but that sounded too much like asking for a raise . And that was clearly not going to help the situation . Pettimento placed his fingertips together , too close to the camera to be in focus on the screen . " Well , Tony , this is a company that prides itself on being responsible and taking care of its employees . If the Entity ca n't help you out , then I 'm sure we can come up with something that will . " " So you 'll let me talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pettimento answered matter-of-factly . " Stand by for a few minutes . It always takes a bit before the front office responds . " Pettimento turned away from the camera and the screen faded to a digital blue . 7 . Wilson sat on the edge of his chair , fidgeting while a " please hold " notice blinked across the screen . Then a simulated voice announced , " Please stand by for the chief executive . " The screen resolved into a picture of the old man with the wind-blown white hair , billowing like a cumulus cloud around his head . " Good afternoon , Mr. Wilson . " One-on-one , the Entity sounded just like meat , Wilson thought . What you heard at the morning pepfest was a deeper and less nasal version of that voice . " Pettimento has explained your situation and your request to me . I 've got a few questions to ask you , if you do n't mind . " " No - please go ahead . " Wilson felt the sweat meandering down his sides again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Entity placed a hand to its chin . " If I get your drift-what makes you think that this treatment would have a positive affect on your son 's autism ? " Wilson took a deep breath . " Well , sir , there are a number of recent reports that show that some kinds of autism - involving a lack of ability to communicate with others and occasional repetitive behavior , some of it self-damaging - can be treated through cerebrum-repair techniques . " " All right , Wilson . I 'll look up the journal articles you 're talking about . " The Entity closed its eyes briefly . " Yes , I see what you mean . Iszetbegovich 's work was the main piece you were thinking about , am I right ? " " Uh , yes sir . " The chief executive frowned . " But Iszetbegovich reported a serious side-effect of his efforts , did he not ? Some forty percent of those treated suffered rapid decline and death . I note that one of our competitors , Avatar Interfacial , purchased the rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore have no idea what anyone has done with it since . " The Entity sounded almost displeased . " Well , sir , you see , things are so bad that - we 're willing to take the chance . " The Entity stared into Wilson 's eyes . " Your son 's in a bad way , is n't he ? " Wilson gazed at the Entity 's face ; he thought it looked like a man who 'd spent a lifetime calculating how much he could get out of a person . " Yes he is . " Wilson frowned and glanced down at his shoes . The chief executive rubbed his jaw and said , " I ca n't let you go through with it , Wilson . There 's just too great a chance that something might happen to your boy . " " But we 're willing to take the chance . " Wilson clenched his hands together . " We 'd sign a letter of understanding absolving the company of any blame . " " You know I 'd like to help you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wilson nodded . That , he thought to himself , is that . " I guess that means I 'm going to have to ask for some leave . " The Entity closed its eyes and said , " I think we can work that out , Wilson . I want you to stick with us , you know . You 've done very well for us here , and we really appreciate your work on both teamazine and karatonin . I know how hard - " and the Entity almost sounded choked up with grief and compassion " - your family difficulties must be for you . Please talk to Pettimento about arranging a reduced work schedule , and , if you do n't mind , I 'll check back with you in a couple of weeks to see how it 's working out . " " All right . " To his own ears , Wilson 's voice sounded small , like a whisper out in a desert . " Keep your chin up , son . " Then the screen went blank . 8 . After he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked down the beige Chico Hills street at the procession of almond-colored four-story apartment buildings , each one with its row of palm trees and carports filled with motorcycles and three-wheeled pods . The perfect home environment , he thought as he walked down the street , for the modern , dumbed-down mid-level executive . As he stood there the words bubbled up from inside him : You 've failed . No other way to put it , Wilson . You did n't get anywhere , and you 've probably gotten yourself in a lot of hot water for trying . He gripped his briefcase resolutely and walked toward his building , staring at the sidewalk in front of him . " Wilson ! " someone called out behind him . He turned around . A trim , short man with black hair came bounding toward him . " You do n't know me , " the man said as he came to a stop , " but my name is Richard de Hagen , and I 'd like to talk to you . " Wilson took a step backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another religious nut , he thought to himself . Like the one last week who was trying to tell everybody at the sashimi bar that the Shintoists were going to take over the world . " I 'd like to hire you . " " Not interested , " Wilson muttered . he turned away , thinking the man was a proselytizer for the Church of the Source . Once he got safely inside his apartment , he was going to call the neighborhood association and find out why they were letting one of them operate here . " I mean it . We 'd like to hire you , Wilson . At a much higher salary and with medical benefits that a skinflint operation like Pharos would never dream of offering . " Wilson turned around , the sweat breaking out along his neck in the late-afternoon Sun . " Just who the hell are you ? " " My name 's de Hagen . I work for Avatar . You 're the man who discovered the pheromone that creates team spirit , which is why we 'd like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson looked at de Hagen 's eyes . You could tell a lot about a man that way . But de Hagen 's eyes were lifeless ; they made him think of his father 's after he 'd died , lying there on the hospital gurney . Must be full of programming , Wilson thought . That 's what a cheapjack outfit like Avatar has to do to keep the hired help from telling business secrets to the competition . That 's what eyes like that mean . " Listen , " Wilson said as quietly as he could , " it 's probably not a good idea to try to meet me here . You know Pharos spies on its employees , do n't you ? " " That 's why I did n't phone . " " Make sure you never do . " " I promise not to . But take this and get in touch . " The man fumbled for something in his shirt pocket . " This will tell you what to do . " De Hagen fished out a small package , about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to Wilson , then walked away . Once he got into his apartment , Wilson found Ellen rocking Jason in the rocking chair by the front window . Jason was asleep . he bent over and kissed her and she held onto his arm . " Who was that man talking to you on the sidewalk ? " she asked softly , nodding toward the window . " I do n't know , " Wilson told her . " Some kind of woo-woo nut , I guess . " Ellen looked at him and it seemed to Wilson she was scared . " That was an awfully long conversation for dealing with a woo-woo nut . " Wilson took a deep breath and looked at the packet in his hands , proof that he was a traitor to the Pharos way of life . " What was he saying ? " Ellen asked . " I could n't figure it out , " Wilson told her . " At first I thought he was from the Church of the Source . " She shook her head slowly . " Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Does your boss , that Pettimento fellow - does he have a relative working in the governor 's office in Sacramento ? " " I do n't have a clue . " " Well , it was a man named Pettimento , and he was going on and on about how only the libertarian agenda could restore the freedoms we 've given up , and how we just need more law and order and less and less government . Everything he said was like that - self-contradictory , but put in a way so you had to think about it before you realized just how contradictory it was . And after the interview , the announcer said this was the man who was developing the governor 's social policy . " " Ellen , you know I do n't follow politics . " " Well , Tony , this really scared me . And when I see you talking to strangers on the street , that scares me , too . " he reached out and held her hand . " Do n't worry , babe . Everything 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the actinic L.A. sunshine looking at his reflection in the windshield of the rental pod , de Hagen kept trying to think about anything but about how badly he needed to hire this guy away from Pharos . Headquarters was in real trouble over the problems they were having with the memory enhancement drug , the cost overruns , the FDA and the NIH subpoenaing the files .... And if they did n't get somebody like a Tony Wilson on the job , the Feds might shut down the whole division . At least Avatar 's eavesdropping viruses had been right on target when it came to the timing of the approach . Nevertheless , de Hagen hated recruiting . It made him feel ... bad . But he had to keep at it because of the agenda item that must not be mentioned . Even thinking that he was n't supposed to be thinking about it almost set off his programming . he had to sit there for several minutes until the tremors stopped , gripping the steering wheel to keep from collapsing . After he was sure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started the engine and headed back toward Interstate 405 . At the hotel they 'd told him to avoid the " nogo " zone between the airport and Long Beach - they were expecting a lot of trouble because the Fourth of july was coming up , and there was always a riot in the nogo on the Fourth , they said . As long as he kept the pod on autopilot , he figured he would n't have any trouble finding the restaurant the hotel staff had recommended . Then he saw the construction zone ahead and the signs in Spanish . His high school Spanish was n't enough to help him figure out what the sign said ; all he could figure out was that " zona no vaya " must mean " nogo . " He wound his way through the traffic barriers and heard a helicopter flying overhead . Then he put his foot on the brake and coasted up to a sign in English that read : " Warning - Automatic pilot zone ends - Resume manual steering . " " Shit . " De Hagen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much traffic , he thought as he started to maneuver through the orange plastic cones . As far as he could tell he was now heading due south . But then he came to a maze of construction barriers and by the time he got through that he was n't sure which way he was headed . In the distance he saw a work crew putting up another sign , so he slowed down to read it . " Warning , " it read , " entering NOGO zone . " A state highway patrolman standing at the exit was waving toward him , so he pulled over and rolled down the window to talk to him . " Sorry about the signs , " the patrolman said as he leaned over to speak . " Somebody stole " em all this morning . Any way , I have to read you your van Volt rights . " " What 's that ? " de Hagen asked . " Under the van Volt decree , you have the right to enter the nogo zone at your own risk . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrolman smiled . " Okay . I 'll take that as a decision . What you need to do is go down Orange Street , here , and then to the third light and you 'll be able to get back onto the freeway and out of the zone . " " Uh , thanks . " he nodded at the patrolman and started driving . De Hagen took the exit and found himself in an almost Disneyesque , bland , **25;2082;TOOLONG neighborhood of dull tract houses . It took him about a block before he realized that all of them were burned-out hulls. he passed the first light . A derelict school bus blocked one of the side streets there . The second light was a couple of blocks farther along Orange Street . But when he got to the light he found that the intersection was blocked off in two directions by the wrecked bodies of burned-out cars . Jesus , he thought , this does n't look good at all . he crossed the intersection and pulled into an alley , backed out , and started to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled out of a parking lot and cut right in front of him , then halted . De Hagen rolled down his window and yelled , " What the hell do you think you 're doing ? " His programming started bubbling up inside him , trying to calm him down . A tremor passed through his legs and he felt dizzy , but then he realized that something was coming toward him along the side of the pod . he turned to see a kid with a gun . " Get outta the pod , suit , or I 'll blow ya freakin " brains out . " De Hagen stared at the heavily tattooed and pierced face with the word NOMAD stenciled on the forehead and then at the unwavering barrel of the pistol pointed straight at him . 10 . " He do n't look too good , " the gunman said to his companion after they dragged de Hagen 's unconscious form out of the back seat of their car . " I bet we get a big-bucks ransom for him , " said the short one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're gon na have fun tryin ' , " Nomad answered , smiling . 11 . Wilson had started the coffee maker and Ellen had just started her shower when the phone rang . " Good morning , " a baritone voice said , " is Tony Wilson there ? " Wilson could n't figure out who it was and the screen just blinked " processing " instead of displaying a caller ID . " Speaking , " he answered . " This is Roger Pettimento . " " Uh - good morning , sir . " " Wilson , I 'm sorry to bother you at home , but we 've got to ask you to come in early this morning . " " But I 've got to help prep our son - " " There 's been quite a development overnight . Have you listened to the news this morning ? " " No . " " Well , let me fill you in . A gang of tribalists abducted an executive from Avatar Interfacial . One of the gang members survived the rescue . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's okay . In the hospital . " Pettimento coughed . " Excuse me . The Entity has decided we have an extraordinary opportunity here . Management thinks the tribalist they 've captured would make an excellent test case for karatonin . We need a planning session about how to proceed , so I 'd like you and Allison Swansea to meet me in my office at 7:30 . " Ellen was going to have a fit when she heard this , Wilson thought . " Could we make it eight , Dr. Pettimento ? " Wilson started thinking that no paycheck was worth this kind of trouble . " I 'm sorry , Wilson . It 's got to be 7:30 . I 've got to catch an 8:30 flight to Sacramento to see if we can be declared the child 's corporate guardian . " Wilson cleared his throat . " Okay . " " I knew I could count on you . " The line went dead . 12 . " They want you to do what ? " Ellen shouted . Her face was red . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You might wake Jason . " She nodded . " You 'd better get going , Tony . Otherwise I 'm afraid I 'll be so angry at them that I 'll start yelling at you . " She grabbed him and hugged him and rocked her head against his shoulder . 13 . Pettimento switched on his office security unit and leaned across his desk . " Here 's the video of the capture that the police released to the news nets this morning , " Pettimento said , looking first at Allison Swansea Wilson 's immediate supervisor - and then at Wilson . The wall screen dilated into a view of the police dragging a young , apparently white , male out of one of the burned-out houses at the northern edge of the nogo zone . he wore swastika earrings and his face was heavily tattooed . " So that 's our boy , " Swansea murmured , brushing one hand over her frosted hair . " Any information about who he is ? " " Not yet , " Pettimento answered . With every word he spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But the legal department says we can still file for guardian status on a John Doe basis . " " We probably can , Roger , " Allison said , " but what happens if he turns out to be the child of some important family who then turns around and sues us ? " Pettimento leaned back from his desk . " And on what basis could they sue us ? " Pettimento 's fingers drummed away at the desktop . " Oh , how about wrongful pursuance of custody ? " Allison pulled her hair back into a pony tail and then let it go across her shoulders . " Just because the libertarians are in the governor 's office in Sacramento does n't mean that child custody law has gone away , you know . " " I want you to take that up with legal as soon as we 're done here . " Pettimento turned to Wilson . " And here 's what I want the research department to do , " Pettimento said , leaning across the desk . " Convert this little tribalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , we 'll try . " Wilson glanced over at Allison . She was leaning her head to one side ; he could n't tell if she understood just how difficult this was likely to be . " But I think we 've got to understand that there are probably a lot of things wrong with this kid that we ca n't take care of with karatonin . " " I 'm counting on you , Wilson . " With a sort of automatic smile , Pettimento drummed out the words with his forefinger , then leaned forward across his desk again . " Because this is what 's going to bury the competition . I find it deliciously ironic that Avatar fell into this sort of misadventure . It serves them right for being such heavy-handed - " Pettimento caught himself short , composed his features , and smiled . Calmly he added , " It 's the opportunity of a lifetime , and we 've got to seize it . " " I absolutely agree , Dr. Pettimento . " Wilson clutched his hands together to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep in mind that any behavioral modification program with a subject with other psychological problems is going to take several months . " " Not a problem , " Pettimento replied , glancing at his wristwatch . " As long as we can show a little progress every few weeks . " Allison nodded . " I think that 's a safe bet , do n't you , Tony ? " Wilson took her tone of voice as a signal that there was no chance he was going to be allowed to design this particular project . " As long as we do n't expect miracles , " Wilson answered , " we should be all right . all the test cases showed at least some improvement after a couple of weeks . " " That 's all I 'm asking for , " Pettimento said , raising his right hand as though he were going to catch a softball . " Do this for me , Wilson , and I 'll make sure we get some kind of special care for that son of yours . " Wilson looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's throat filled and he had to swallow several times before he could say , " Thank you , sir . " " Roger , " Swansea said , " while we 're on the subject , we really need to send a note to the Avatar people expressing our sympathy for their man de Hagen . " Pettimento looked non-plussed . " Why 's that ? " " Because it 's fitting , " Swansea said sweetly . " Besides , they 'll think we had something to do with it if we do n't . " Pettimento nodded as though he understood . " Take care of it , wo n't you ? " Then he nodded again and stood up . The meeting was finished . 14 . " We have n't seen a programming implant like yours for quite a while , " the doctor told de Hagen , crossing her arms . De Hagen tried to smile . he was not going to get into a discussion of how his parents had developed this particular programming device in order to convince the judge to let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught with all that fine cocaine and heroin in his veins . It was so typical of his parents to develop a new technology to compensate for their failings as human beings , and then to make a fortune out of it . Oh , and by the way , Richie boy , sorry about the side-effects . " I was one of the first trial cases , " he said quietly . The doctor nodded . " Well , you did n't suffer much in the way of trauma , so we 're going to discharge you , but if you have any trouble with your implant , I want you to get medical attention right away . Is that clear ? " She gave him a condescending look . " What kind of trouble are we talking about ? " " Oh , dizziness . " She shrugged . " A ringing in your ears , or any kind of visual . Unusual depth perception , flashes of color - that sort of thing . " " Okay . " " Well , then . " She stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and left the hospital room . He 'd gotten through the discussion without thinking of topic number one . Call it a small victory , he told himself . When he made it back to his hotel he called headquarters . " Good morning , " he said when he got through to O'Georgeovich 's office . " Is she in ? " " Oh , Mr. de Hagen , " the secretary answered , " hold for just a minute . " De Hagen did n't recognize the secretary 's voice and could n't tell if she was real or sim . Deep beneath the heavy layers of his programming , he felt a twinge of inadequacy over not being able to figure out which she was . " The Ms. has asked you to talk directly to the AI . Please hold . " " Uh , hello ? " he did n't really want to talk to artificial intelligence right now . But the beeping on the line indicated that the connection was already going through . " Richard , my boy ! " The resonant baritone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the artificial personality that held the Avatar Consortium together . " Thank the good Lord that you 've come through this all right . " " Well , I 'm glad , too . " " And , Richard - how did you make out with your assignment ? " De Hagen had to think for a minute exactly what the AI meant ; so much had happened he 'd put Wilson out of his thoughts . " Well , I would n't say I made much progress . At least I made contact . But not much more than that . " " Do n't sound so crestfallen , my boy . You did your best . " " I 'm sorry . " " Do n't worry about it . Now , here 's what our contacts have come up with : The competition is going to try to make an example of that lad who helped abduct you . seems they 're going to have him made a ward of their company . You can do that under some of this confounded legislation out there in California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Maybe so , my boy . Maybe so . But there 's no sign they had a direct hand in what happened to you . One could argue , of course , that the competition 's support for all these political splinter parties set the scene for what befell you . " " No. " he shook his head . " It 's my fault . I should n't have gotten anywhere near the nogo zone . " De Hagen 's hands started trembling and the inside of his head started to fizz . he was edging toward anger and his programming was trying to pull him back . " Self-recrimination will not help , Richard . " The AI cleared its simulated throat . " I think you should change your ticket and come home . If needs be , we can always send you back out again . " " All right . " De Hagen breathed deep , and the trembling in his hands began to abate . " I 'll be on the next flight out . " " And when you get back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do about the competition 's plan for this delinquent who attacked you . " The AI almost sounded bitter . " The Ms. will be in touch when you get back . " " Right . " just as soon as he put the headset in its cradle , the phone rang again . " Hello ? " " Richard , how are you ? " Even worse than the AI - it was his mother . 15 . Maybe she had n't really understood what Wilson had said . Allison Swansea asked quietly , " Would you repeat that ? " " I said the kid tried to commit suicide last night . " Allison sat down . This was the worst possible way to begin a Wednesday morning . Pettimento always held a senior management meeting at 9:00 on Wednesdays. he was going to want a very complete record of what had happened to Rico , the young tribalist , now that they had removed all the temporary tattoos and had started him off as a ward of the company .... " Give me the whole dump . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And please sit down . " " About eleven last night , " Wilson said as he took a seat , " Rico tried to hang himself using his bedsheets . We 've got sims monitoring all the time , so we had an agent in there before he could do himself any harm . " " Have we had - anybody talk to him yet ? " " That 's why I 'm here . I think you should come with me ? . " She nodded . " Now . " " Good God , Tony . I 've got the nine o'clock meeting to go to . " " That 's in twenty minutes . Spend just a couple of minutes with me , talking to Rico . He 's down from the euphoric they gave him , and the sims claim he 's maintaining . " She counted to ten under her breath . This was a part of the adventure that she did n't want to experience , thank you very much . Trying to sound as commanding as she could , she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Because you 're a clinical psycho-pharmacist , Allison . And you 're good at this sort of thing . In fact , we do n't really have anybody better . " He took a deep breath . " And you might recall that management has enjoined us from hiring any outside help on this case . " She glanced at him blankly - a look intended to remind him that she was in charge - then nodded once . " You 're right . I 'd better have a firsthand report for the meeting . " She got up and headed out the door . Wilson raced after her . 16 . " So are you , like , supposed to be my mom or somethin ' ? " Rico asked from his perch on the back of the sofa in his psychotropically pink room . " No , Rico . Fm Allison Swansea . " Rico sat there without moving . he was n't frowning , but he sure was n't smiling . " We wanted to see how you were doing , Rico , " Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , it sucks in here . " he glanced from Allison to Tony and back again . " Why 's that , Rico ? " Allison asked . " Everything . You wiped all my tats off . You make me wear this stuff . " He plucked at his plain blue T-shirt . " It 's all bullshit . " he slid down the back of the sofa and sat cross-legged on the cushions . " Bullshit , bullshit , bullshit . " Rico began slapping the cushions as hard as he could . " Hey - it 's going to be all right , " Tony said , walking toward him with his arms outstretched . Rico started screaming and leaped toward Tony with his fists flying . Tony spread his hands , palms outward , to keep the kid at bay . With a loud clicking sound , one of the sim agents opened the door and walked in . Rico took one look at the robot and fell silent , retreating toward the nearest corner of the room . " I hate them , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm afraid it 's time to go , " she said quietly . Then , turning toward the boy , she added , " Rico , I 'll be back later in the day . " " Thanks for coming , " Rico growled . 17 . " We need to win this one , " Pettimento told them , tapping the conference table with his fingers in time to his words . His eyes scored Allison , then raked across Wilson . Something about them made Tony think of cigarette ashes . " If we can show , " Pettimento went on , tapping his finger , " that we can turn around a completely screwed-up character like this kid , I dare say that none of the competition will stand a chance against us . " Pettimento mustered up a confident smile and gazed along the conference table , pausing briefly to nod at Dietrich from the marketing department , and finally focusing on Allison . Wilson noticed that a muscle in Allison 's eyelid was twitching . " And so , Allison , we 'd be grateful if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right , " she answered , trying to sound confident . " Well , as you all know , " she glanced around the room and then turned back toward Pettimento , " we 've had Rico with us for almost two weeks now . We 've made some improvement . For example , he 's put on three kilos and seems to have a more healthy appetite . But we had a bad night last night ; I wo n't try to put this diplomatically . " She inhaled deeply . " Rico tried to commit suicide . " Pettimento 's face seemed to collapse . " I 'm sorry to hear that , " he muttered . Several others around the table echoed his words . With a nod of her head , Allison said , " I 've decided that we have to begin an entire battery of reprogramming . Rico 's got to be able to maintain . " Pettimento lowered his head . " I ca n't emphasize sufficiently the importance of your succeeding . " " I think we 've got to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glared at him . " I think that goes without saying . " Pettimento frowned . " That will beau . " 18 . They 'd managed to get Jason to bed early enough so that Ellen could go for one of her long runs , and Wilson sat on the couch , trying to figure out how much he could say before his programming knocked him out . There had to be a way that he could tell Ellen what he thought about the way the human trial was going . just avoid the details and tell her that he thought everything was going disastrously wrong . Behind him he heard the front door open . " Lover , I 'm back , " Ellen said quietly . She sat down beside him and kissed him on the cheek . Heat cascaded off her face and she smiled at him with that amazing calm that always rose up inside her after she 'd gone running . " Honey , what 's the matter ? " sheasked . " Are y ou coining down with something ? " " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got a fever . " he shifted on the couch so he could face her . " Ellen , this is hard for me . There 's trouble at work . " She nodded . " Okay . " " They 're running a .... " His concentration drifted off . " They 're doing something that 's just bad science , " he managed to say at last . " Really ? I thought they were supposed to be such a reputable company . " he shrugged . " I guess they think it must be good business or something . " " Or they 're trying to show off so their lobbyists can get some kind of tax break in Washington . " " I never thought of that . " he reached out and grasped her hands in his . " You know how much I hate politics . " he raised her hands , kissed them and added , " I never would have thought of that . " She leaned toward him . " Tony , is this so bad you might lose your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trying to make him so sick he could n't answer . " Maybe . " His heart started pounding irregularly . " But if I keep a lowenough profile , I think I can survive . " " Well , we can always ask my father for help - if it comes down to that . " Wilson shook his head . " No , babe . I wo n't let that happen . He 'll try to make us put Jason in a home again , and I wo n't let that happen . I wo n't . " " Shhh . " She reached out and pulled him close . " Do n't wake Jason . " She started fumbling at his chest . " What are you doing ? " " Shh . I 'm unbuttoning your shirt . " She pulled him yet closer and kissed him . 19 . Two days after they started adding karatonin to Rico 's food , Wilson met the adolescent psychologist they 'd hired on contract , Dr. Richard Tare . " Call me Surf , " Tare said with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor . " " Even in front of Swansea ? " Tony asked . " Especially in front of her . " Tare shook his head . " Now let 's see if we can get this young man interested in education . " They walked into the encounter room where Rico was waiting for them . " Good morning , Rico , " Tare said as they entered the room . Rico looked up from his gameboy at Tare and said , " Hi , Surf . " " Hi , Rico , " Wilson added . Rico nodded back . " So like , I 've got a thing to put you , " Tare said , cutting the air with one hand , thumb and little finger extended . " We got a man here to get you , like , the same as school . " " Yeah ? " Rico looked interested . " Could I , uh , play sports ? " " You score a degree in Frisbee , my man , " Tare replied . " Could n't you just teach me how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the big ones , but we 'll see . " Tare turned toward Wilson and asked , " Do you think we can get authorization for me to teach Rico to surf ? " Wilson shrugged his shoulders . " I do n't see why not . But we 'll have to ask , of course . " Tare turned back to Rico . " So , like , there you are where you are . " Rico laughed . " But we got to get you an education , Rico . Seriously . " " Like , I was ready for that . You know I can read , don'cha ? " " Yeah . But there 's a lot more to it . " " As long as I get to surf . " Rico smiled shyly . " We 'll work it . " Wilson was having trouble following what they were talking about , so it was a relief to follow Tare out into the hall . Once outside , Wilson asked , " What the hell was that all about ? " Tare chuckled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dude , you got to qualify in youthspeak . " Tare shook his head and smiled . " Mr. Rico is willing . I do n't know about ready and able , but he 's definitely willing . " 20 . That night , at Surf 's request , Rico started keeping a journal . Surf had told him that he had to write in longhand in a spiral-bound notebook , on paper . His first entry read : " It suks here . But at least they do nt treet me like real bad like Nomad wich is an improovment I guess . " 21 . Two weeks later Pettimento called , his voice heavy through the telephone , sounding almost like the beginning of a rock slide . " Allison , " he said , " I need some kind of progress report on Rico . " She 'd been working through the quarterly marketing report and it took her a moment to realize what Pettimento was talking about . Then it clicked . " Did n't we just send you the weekly evaluation ? " " Yes you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What was going on here ? she wondered . Out loud she asked , " Can you be more specific , Rog ? " Pettimento cleared his throat nervously . " What I need is something that shows karatonin is helping the kid . " " Hmm . " She tapped her pen against the hardcopy marketing report . " Let me talk with people and get back to you . " Very quietly he added , " I need something for tomorrow morning . " " We 'll have it for you . " " Thanks . " Pettimento hung up . Allison sat there wondering what was wrong with Pettimento now . It had to be some kind of demand from the Entity itself . Nobody else could have had quite that intense an effect on the jerk . 22 . Tare saw the message from Swansea on his machine when he came back to his office . " Urgent . Please come in person to Room 1433 , East Tower , " it read , " Secure meeting soonest before COB . Repeat , urgent . Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to murmur , " What the hey ? " As he stood there waiting for his lower brain to stop broadcasting retaliatory lizard thoughts , it occurred to him that this was a message loaded with semantic interference , a veritable Cadillac of cognitive dissonance . That repetition of the word " urgent , " for instance - that looked like sheer fear . It was already after five when he headed out of his office and over to the executive tower . Once he got past the sims and into her office he realized that the vice president for research was not just scared , but outright panicky . " Oh - hello . " She looked up with a start from her computer screen . Her entire affect screamed out for sleep , with a faint , desperate undertone of sexual need . Tare considered that prospect , then rejected it . Too many grappling hooks . " I got your message . What 's it all about ? " " I wish I knew . " She pulled back her shoulder-length brown hair with both hands . Tare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd seen in , oh , the last thirty minutes . Then she reached out and flicked on the office security system . " I got a frantic call from the 18th floor asking for a brand-new report on our friend Rico . Something that will - and I 'm quoting now - show that " karatonin is improving the boy . ' " She blew out her cheeks in a surprisingly good imitation of Pettimento . " That 's not so hard to show . I 've taken him out surfing twice now , and I think there are actually some times when he 's been happy . " he smiled , remembering Rico laughing as he first stood up on his board . " Out there on the water , anyway . " Swansea nodded and smiled vaguely . " Are you keeping a journal on him ? " " You know I am . It 's company policy . " " I think that 'll do it . Can you release it to me and Pettimento ? " She shivered . It looked to Tare very much like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said slowly . " But I do n't like the idea . " " I 'm ordering you to turn it over , " she told him , frowning like a Marine Corps drill instructor . " Well , that 's just fine and dandy , but first you 're going to have to listen to my five bucks " worth . " he cleared his throat to make sure he was n't going to sound overbearing . " Karatonin works by enhancing the caudal ? area 's judgmental functions , so in most cases , it 's like a cup of coffee in the morning . But for about five percent of the people who take it , it causes depression . Nothing we 've seen suggests it can increase intelligence , or overcome the kind of culture that turns people into couch potatoes . " Her frown became deeper . " And now that you 've gotten that off your chest , I suppose you want to complain about the circus going on at the state capitol in Sacramento . " He shrugged . " Not particularly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't strike me as the libertarian type . " " Well , basically - they 're not really libertarians . " Leaning back in her chair , she laughed . " You are one of us , are n't you ? " " They 're just hangers-on in Sacramento , " he told her , trying not to show his anger at the state government . " They can talk the talk about reducing the federal government to nothing and dropping taxes in favor of users " fees . But they 've got nothing to do with real libertarianism . " She smiled and shook her head . " So that means you 're an independent . " " Pretty much . " " Take it from me - you 're going to have to learn to shut up if you 're going to make it in this company . " " I 'll take that under advisement . " She cleared her throat . " Look . Send me your journal pages . Whether or not we 're improving Rico 's caudal matter . " She smiled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Private Tare . " Thanks . " Tare nodded and left . Out in the hall , walking past the office of the vice president for nuance , he started berating himself for shooting his mouth off . Her comment about keeping his mouth shut kept going around and around in his head . Unless you help this kid out , Tare thought , that particular conversation at this particular time means you 're screwed . 23 . Rico sat down at the end of the day and wrote in his journal : " Today I wached a video . About hows come pepel are bad . Its becuz people are not responsebul enuf . It sed if you are responsebul then you will be a produktiv meber of sosiety . I wasnt sure if they know what they meen . Wen I axed wat , all Surf sed was I would find out . I hate wen they cant explain what they talking about . But it made me think about something scarey . About what I should do . But I do nt think Im old enuf for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month after Tare began tutoring Rico , something happened that surprised Tare . Partway through a survey of 20th century history , Rico froze and seemed to withdraw so completely that not even a video about the Battle of Midway could coax him out of his shell . After the video was over , Rico sat there , staring at nothing . Finally Tare gave up trying to teach the material and said , " Like , Rico , I thought you were interested in this stuff . " Rico shrugged but would n't look at Tare . " Was n't that a cool video ? " Rico nodded . " And yesterday you were like , the book on the second World War is way cool . And today you wo n't even look at the video . What 's happened , man ? " He did n't look at Tare when he muttered , " I started to - " Then he fell silent for a moment . " I just ca n't , Surf . " " Dude , what 's wrong ? " The boy nodded his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the gesture of a small child , Tare thought , not a fifteen-year-old . Retreat into a prepubescent pattern definitely meant something very bad had happened . " Dude , can you show me what 's wrong ? " Without saying a word , keeping his head bowed , Rico opened the book and handed it to Tare . It was open to a chapter titled , " The Holocaust : The Destruction of the European Jews . " 25 . In his journal that night , Rico wrote : " Surf is my best friend in this place . he says I am doing good at school but I still need to develop a sens of balans about things . What Surf does nt unnerstand is that Im special . I have the ability to swallow up all the troubles in the world and do something about them . The more I think about the more I guess it does nt matter how old I am . If Im the special one then I have to do it . " 26 . Tare slammed the report down on Swansea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid off karatonin , " he told Swansea , almost growling . he could n't help himself . " It 's making him blame himself for everything . And he 's got no way to deal with it . Before you know it , he 'll probably be psychotic . " Swansea 's nostrils flared . " I said I would take your recommendation into consideration , Dr. Tare . " " And I 'm telling you that if you do n't stop giving Rico this stuff I 'm going to quit . " Once more her nostrils flared . " Dr. Tare , I accept your resignation , effective immediately . " " You ca n't do that ! " he slapped his hands together . " I think the recording will make it quite clear that you offered your resignation after it became obvious that you could not carry out the policy of this corporation . Now I would be grateful if you would leave my office . " As her words sank in , Tare began to feel like he was floating - and the office seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I hope the recording also demonstrates , " he told her , " that I tried to warn you that this program is n't going to work . The kid 's too screwed up . " Swansea glared at him . " Get out now before I call security . " " I 'm going . " he backed away until he felt the doorknob behind him . 27 . Rico 's last journal entry read : " There 's no other way . There just is n't . If they can kill off millions and millions of people in holocausts then it does not matter what happens to me . Because I am another one of the special ones . We only come along every few centuries but no matter what we do another one of us will have to come along again to try to make things better . Eventually things will get better as long as we keep trying . " So I guess I 've decided to do it . " 28 . Allison nodded vigorously at the screen as the Entity concluded its instructions : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 'll see all the difference in the world . " She typed , " Right away . " The screen went blank , and Allison told the sims to get her the woman at the top of the short list to replace Tare - Cynthia Paneras . Allison typed a few notes for her work journal until the woman 's pudgy face appeared on the video screen . " Good morning , Cynthia , " Allison said . " Good morning to you , Ms. Swansea . Let me say it 's a privilege to talk to you . " Paneras smiled . Swansea thought it was one of the ugliest grimaces she 'd ever seen . " Let me say at the outset , Paneras , that you come highly recommended . Any initial thoughts about the approach you 'd like to take with our very troubled young man ? " " Yes . " She cleared her throat . " I hope you wo n't be offended ... if I tell you that I do n't think all these secular humanist history and adventure films he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , I think we need to emphasize morality . " " You mean the Bible ? " " Oh yes . " Paneras gazed up expectantly , almost grinning . " Do n't you think that 's what 's been missing in the boy 's program ? " Allison thought the Entity would be overjoyed , if it were capable of anything remotely like an emotion . " Sounds exactly like what he needs to me , " Allison told her , smiling as warmly as she could . 29 . Rico had been thinking about it since the whole scene with Nomad ended that long gone , nogo day . The way out . The end . The air 's so heavy , like rocks piled up on top of you , Rico thought as he walked toward the Metro station . Almost like a voice inside his head , something said , " Maybe you 'd be able to figure out another way . " But there was n't one . He 'd been thinking about it for all these months , and there just was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean , when they 'd let him go surfing , the voice had gone away for a while . But then it came back when he came into shore . So he 'd been maintaining and forcing himself to read . It was n't too bad until he read that story about the holocaust . And the Bible stuff just made it worse . he could n't stop thinking , why was the world so bad , and why could n't he just have a boring old mom and dad like everybody else , and why could n't he have helped them be better people .... And the answer was that it was all his fault . Like Dad used to say , " If you was n't here , I 'd be free . " But it was only in the last week , after they started having him read the New Testament , that Rico began to realize he was just like Jesus . Sometimes he started wondering if maybe he was Jesus . he was supposed to come back , after all . And then he figured out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries , only most of them did n't get a religion built around them . But what had kept him from making the decision was that everything he did was wrong and he hurt inside all the time and there was just one way out . Only that was n't the way Jesus felt . But he finally figured out that Jesus had felt just the same way he felt , only the people around him did n't understand what was going on inside his head . Rico walked up the steps to the Metro station and put his farecard through the turnstile and walked onto the platform . The sign showed the train was due in two minutes . He 'd done a good enough job of maintaining so that they kept telling him he was getting better and they started to let him go outside . Eventually they let him take the Metro on his own . Dr. Swansea kept saying what he needed was to get out . So they gave him a farecard and started him going to the YMCA . The swimming he liked . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , when he was playing softball and standing out in left field with the Sun waving down at him from the cement-colored sky , he had time to think . And that 's how he finally figured out how to do it . If you 've got all the things that are wrong in the world inside you , he thought as he looked across to second base , you have to take them all with you . You 've got to do it . He saw the train rushing toward him along the track . Even if you do n't really want to , you 've got to do it . Everything wrong in the world will end with you if you just .... Be like Jesus . And as he jumped in front of the train , he thought , I forgive even you , Nomad , for making me have sex with you all those times . The train smelled like oil and ozone and sounded like bowling pins scattering 30 . Wilson thought Pettimento looked like hell . The bags under his eyes were the color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him anymore , so he focused his attention on the signed photo hanging on the wall : the governor dressed as Annie Oakley , cradling a shotgun in each arm , like something from one of the cheap souvenir stands at Hollywood and Vine . Without looking up , Pettimento said , " The Entity is very disappointed that the team was not able to prevent Rico from killing himself . " After tapping his hands against the desktop , he looked up and almost whispered , " They 've told me that they would accept both of your resignations . " " But Rog , " Allison sputtered , " that 's not at all called for . " A warning chime rang and a synthetic voice announced : " Emergency call from your brother in Sacramento . " Pettimento frowned deeply and muttered , " Excuse me. " he picked up a handset and spoke quietly , then turned away from the others . At one point he almost shouted , " She did what ? " he said something very quietly about calling back , then returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pettimento stared at the top of his desk . Wilson and Swansea looked at one another nervously . Sweat rolled down from Wilson 's armpits and the sound of his heart drummed repeatedly in his ears . At last Pettimento said , " That 's the Entity 's offer . " he closed his eyes and shook his head . " So you 're looking for a scapegoat , " Wilson said . Allison turned and stared into Wilson 's eyes . " Damn it all , Wilson , ca n't you shut up ? " " Excuse me , " Wilson snapped back . " You were the one who overruled Dr. Tare , who was the only one who kept saying that karatonin was n't going to help the kid . " he turned back to Pettimento . " And because you would n't have done any of this without authorization from the Entity , which means that there 's something really wrong at the heart of this company , I 'm not going to tender my resignation . I want to stay here and fix it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Pettimento said , his voice a distracted monotone . " Well , I have news for you . " Wilson looked over at Swansea , who shook her head and would n't look him in the eye . " You 're going to have to fire me . " Pettimento looked at Wilson . " Then you 're fired , " Pettimento said coldly . " Report to personnel right now . " " And maybe it 's just in the nick of time , " Wilson said as he left . Swansea raised her eyebrows as Wilson went out the door . Once the door had closed , she said calmly , " You realize that under the terms of my contract you ca n't fire me . " Pettimento nodded . " I 'm aware of that , " he replied without looking up . As calmly as she could , she told him , " Let me assure you that I 'll have your resignation before you ever get mine . " Without looking backward , she left the room . 31 . " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Entity/ " She sat there , looking at the cool aquamarine walls of her office while the sims digested her request , " One moment , " the sim murmured . " One moment . We are processing . " The screen turned a royal blue , and then the simulated face of the grand old man materialized . " Allison , what 's happened ? " asked the fatherly voice . " We 're in very serious trouble . I 've tried to buy us some time with the news agencies about the boy 's suicide , but it 's turning into an international story now . " " Well , that was bound to happen . We 've got to go on as best we can . " The old man smiled in a manner intended to restore confidence , a gesture that Allison 's father had designed into the program when he was the head of design for Pharos . " I guess I should n't have let us do this sort of experiment until we had better long-term data . " " That 's why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just fired the person who was most likely to be able to carry out the sort of research we needed to get out of trouble . " " You mean the young Mr. Wilson . " " I do . " " Yes . Roger is telling me about that even as we speak . " There was that smile again . " He 'll have his reasons , of course , " Allison said . " But , as your records will show , Pettimento was responsible for rushing into this experiment . I did everything I could to make it succeed once we 'd started . But I think we should have sought some additional cover by bringing in an external psychological assessment team . I take the blame for that . And as you 'll recall , I fired the principal member of the assessment team with cause . " " I did n't trust him either , Allison , once we saw what sort of man Dr. Tare really was . " She took a deep breath . " I am invoking the ethics clause of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me go with the full severance package , or that you let Mr. Pettimento go and give me his job . " The gaunt old man nodded . " Give me a moment , Allison . I 'll have to process that . " The screen went blank , then shifted to royal blue again . She knew what was going on , but that did n't make it any easier . The many artificial intelligences that managed various parts of the company were conferring . Each one of them was modeled to reproduce the talents of famous individuals , and that entailed dealing with some of the model 's weaknesses as well . And so they were arguing , as any group of old people might , weighing whether she or Pettimento would do a better job in getting Pharos through this particular mess . The face reappeared on the screen . " We 've decided to let Mr. Pettimento go . You 'll need to assume his portfolio immediately . " 32 . It was three in the morning and Wilson sat alone in the living room , drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things considered , he thought , things were n't so bad . You 've got six months " worth of unemployment and you got out when the going was good . Still , Ellen had n't taken it very well . She called and canceled the child-care service at once , even though he 'd told her they had enough money to keep it . You know if you 're so worried about it , he told himself , you could always go and call Avatar and see if they still want you . he sat there on the lounge chair without moving . Somewhere he still had the package that the Avatar guy had given him . Quietly he got up and walked into the hall and started rummaging through the desk drawers . Then he remembered where he 'd put it . It took a couple of minutes to move the chair and open the wall safe . The packet of pills was where he 'd left it . he stuffed it into the breast pocket of his pajama tops and walked out to the kitchen and shut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read for the first time through the indications notice on the back of the package . " Ultraviolet Night antidependent , " the label said , " for use in overcoming psychological programming , including high-meme-content advertising , political and business propaganda . " By the time he got that far , his hands were shaking and he was feeling weak behind the knees . This was the stuff Pharos had warned him about . But to get rid of the stuff Pharos had put into him , he had to .... Despite the quaking in his limbs , Wilson managed to fill a glass with water and pop one of the capsules . 33 . Allison Swansea finished her morning shower and decided she had to try to get Wilson back . It was as simple as that . As soon as she got out of the blow drier , she called the sims on her secure line . " Call Tony Wilson and have him phone me this morning , " she said . There was a brief humming on the line , then the synthetic voice announced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reject any calls from the Pharos Corporation . " " Damn , " she said , placing the handset carefully back in its cradle . She considered the alternatives , ruled them out , and decided to go see him herself . 34 . When he woke the next day , Wilson felt stronger than he usually did in the morning , even though he had n't had much sleep . But there was something else going on inside him - something he could n't quite describe .... Ellen noticed the difference right away . " You got up in the middle of the night , lover , " she said . " Are you okay ? " " Oh , I just could n't sleep . " She shook her head . " No , there 's something else . " " Well , I started taking some anti-programming pills . " Ellen looked at him as though she had n't heard him right . " What 's wrong ? " he asked . " No - nothing . I just thought you used to say that Pharos did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's all . " He almost laughed . " Well , I was wrong . Like I was about a lot of things . " They had about an hour before Jason woke up , so they rushed through breakfast and Ellen went in and took her shower . Wilson sat down and phoned the Avatar headquarters number in Connecticut printed on the packet of Ultraviolet Night . " The Avatar Instrumentality , " a male voice announced when the connection had gone through . " Please connect me with Richard de Hagen . " " Please hold . " A quiet rhythm track began playing . When the music stopped , de Hagen came on the line . " Good morning , Tony . Can I help you ? " " I 'd like to know if there 's any chance your offer might still be open . " " I 'm not sure . I 'll have to check . " " Please . Please do . " " Are you on a secure line ? " de Hagen asked . " Uh , no. just my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to you tomorrow . " De Hagen cut the connection . Wilson looked at the handset and shook his head . Somehow he 'd thought that Avatar would have jumped at the chance to hire him . If they were n't interested anymore , then he was out of ideas . How strange it felt to be a man bereft of ideas . Maybe he 'd been programmed so long he would n't be able to adjust anymore ; this could be just the first indication of what the rest of his life was going to be like . A snippet from one of his college textbooks came back to haunt him , something about how programming had developed in response to increasing global economic competition . Without the programming , was he going to be able to compete in the job market ? It was a question he could n't answer . But if it were true , how in the hell were they going to keep taking care of Jason ? And until he was really free of the programming , how could he ever figure out what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the one person who had n't been given the full treatment had been the only contractor on the project - Surf Tare . If there was anyone who could help him figure out what his options were , Tare was the man . I 've got to talk to the guy , he told himself . And not over the phone where anybody could listen in . But in person . And while I 'm at it , I 'm going to ask him what he figures Pettimento was talking to his brother in Sacramento about , the day that I got fired . 35 . That morning , while Ellen was getting through the potty business with Jason , Wilson called Tare 's office number , learned he was in , and decided to ask Ellen . After they had Jason settled in his playpen , Wilson broached the subject . " Ellen , there 's somebody I want to go see . he was the psychologist on the Rico case . He 's working at a street clinic down in Long Beach . " She nodded absently while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The guy does n't seem to have a personal phone , and the clinic told me I could probably see him this morning if I went down there in person . " " Oh , Tony . " Her voice fell in disappointment , but she caught herself and tried not to let him see how much she did n't want him to go . " Could you manage Jason alone this morning ? " She swallowed and tried to look brave . " You 've really got to do this , do n't you ? ; " He nodded . There was n't anything else he needed to do more than just to talk with somebody else who knew what had happened . Jason laughed . " Did you hear that ? " Ellen asked . He laughed again . " Jason , what a good boy ! " Ellen said , leaning down to embrace him . Jason let her do it , although he quickly built up that autistic wall between himself and the rest of the world once more . Wilson hunkered down beside her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be gone for just a couple of hours . " She nodded , kissed him , and quickly turned back to Jason . 36 . Wilson had been gone about fifteen minutes when the doorbell rang . Jason had retreated into his quiet place , so she picked him up and put him in the playpen . Thinking Tony had forgotten something like his keys - which he did all the time - Ellen went to the front door without even looking at the security monitor . There was a severe looking , ash-blonde woman in a practically martial linen business suit . " Good morning . I 'm Allison Swansea of the Pharos Corporation . I used to work with your partner , Tony Wilson . " Ellen took an immediate dislike to her voice . " Yes ? " " Is Tony home ? " " No , I 'm sorry he is n't . What 's it about ? " " Well , I 've been put in charge of things - maybe you saw the news about the shake-up at the company ... ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been kind of - tied up - since Tony was fired . " " I see . " Swansea had n't been expecting that . " Well , could you tell Tony to call me when he gets back ? I think he 'd like what I 've done at the company . I 've cleaned up a lot of the problems . " She fished out one of her business cards from her purse and handed it over to Ellen . Ellen examined the card long enough to see that Swansea was listed as " senior vice president . " She looked up and said , " I 'll tell him just as soon as he gets back from Long Beach . " Swansea looked puzzled . " What 's he doing in Long Beach ? " " He went down to talk to one of the people he used to work with . I 'm sorry , I do n't remember the name . " Ellen smiled as though she were a complete ditz because that was exactly the way Ms. Swansea made her feel . " You mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Swansea shook her head . " They did what ? " Swansea smiled as though she were talking to somebody 's pet dog . " Well , as you say , you 've been , uh , preoccupied . " Ellen felt genuinely empty-headed now , and Jason began crying . " You 'll have to excuse me , " Ellen said , backing into the apartment and closing the door . She ran to see what Jason had done , but he seemed fine . he stopped crying when she picked him up , and she hugged him as though someone were trying to rip him out of her arms . She rocked him back and forth . Never again , she thought , am I going to let somebody look at me like I 'm some sort of underling without spitting in her face . 37 . Swansea walked back to her pod and got her secure phone out of her purse . " This is the vice president , " she said into the handset . It beeped twice , showing it had recognized her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What can I do for you , Allison ? " the fatherly voice asked . " Wilson went off to Long Beach this morning . " " But there 's serious trouble there - " She nodded vigorously , even though there was no camera to catch her gesture . " Canyoustilltrackhim ? Or has he taken enough deprogramming to clean out his system ? " Just a moment , Allison . " There was a quiet hum to let her know the line was still secure . " Yes , we can still track him , although it 's only a faint trace . He 's on the trolley , headed into central Long Beach . " " Can you get me a helicopter right away ? " " Oh , I 'm afraid I ca n't recommend using a helicopter . Drive to the Santa Monica water taxi port , and we 'll have a corporate speedboat waiting for you there . " She programmed the dashboard computer . " It should take me about twenty minutes to get there . " " The ship will be waiting when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She switched off the phone , put it back in her purse , and started the pod 's engine . 38 . Wilson looked up from his hard copy of American Psycho-Chemical Reviewbecause something flashed outside . he turned and looked out the window as the trolley rolled through the nogo zone . There was some sort of emergency van , lights flashing , driving alongside them . He did n't think much of it . Must be a fire someplace , he thought . That was when he heard the shooting . Damn , he thought , it must be some kind of trouble in the nogo . He 'd been happy to be alone on the trolley , but now he wished there were somebody else on board . Or at least that he was still able to afford a portable phone . Then he could have called Ellen . The trolley did n't stop at the stations in the nogo anymore ; they were all fenced off so the trains could keep rolling . But he was n't sure if the soldiers standing around by the stations were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . If only he had a phone .... 39 . As de Hagen sat looking out at the Pacific from the deck of the Novamira hotel , his phone began beeping at his side , three beeps followed by a pause - the signal for an incoming secure call . " Hello , " he said as he sat forward on his beach chair . " This is artificial intelligence , " said the ghostly voice , swirling undertones echoing faintly behind it . " We have detected an effort by the Pharos Corporation to rehire the prospect . You will need to intercept the prospect in Long Beach in approximately one hour . " " But they 've declared martial law down there ! Did n't you hear that on the news ? " " Yes , and I also heard they 've arrested the governor after the nets starting investigating her arms deals using the Los Angeles nogo zone as cover , which never would have happened had that boy not killed himself . Nevertheless , you 're going to have to take your scanning equipment to Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " " But how am I supposed to get there ? " " There is a water taxi waiting for you at the hotel pier . Number 344 . You must be on board in fifteen minutes . " " Right . " De Hagen switched off the call and started gathering his belongings together . Was it just his imagination , he thought as he looked out over the hotel 's beach front , or was that smoke billowing up from the direction of Long Beach ? Shivers ran through him ; he must have gotten a little too close to thinking consciously of the real agenda . It took him five minutes he could n't spare to regain control so he could stand up and get on with things . 40 . The trolley 's sim was n't working right . It ran through all of the stops until it reached the decrepit station at Seventh Street in central Long Beach . " This car is out of service , " the sim announced , " all passengers must exit . " Closing his copy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright sunshine . It took him a moment to orient himself . Tare 's office was about eight blocks north and a couple of blocks west . Unsure of his bearings , Wilson stuck to Long Beach Boulevard and cut left when he hit Fifteenth . After a couple of blocks he started seeing the graffiti . At first it was small , obviously painted by several hands . It repeated one slogan over and over again : " The right to buy weapons is the right to be free . " When he turned the corner , it looked like no more than two or three people had painted the slogan across windows and doors all along Fifteenth . The graffiti on Tare 's building was particularly thick . Wilson had to stand back to make sure he could see the street number properly through all the paint . There was an iron grill across the front door and a security screen at the side , made of some paint-resistant plastic . None of the graffiti had stuck to the surface , and Wilson pressed the button for service . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced . " Please come back - " " But I 've got to see Dr. Tare ! " he shouted at the sim . " He said he 'd be here ! " There was an electronic burping sound . " One moment , please . One moment , please . " A series of beeps followed . " Please place your ID on the screen , " the sim announced . Wilson complied , pulling out his wallet and producing his driver 's license . " You are expected , Anthony A. Wilson of Chino Hills . Please enter and wait for the exterior door to close . " Silently the grill and outer door swung inward . Wilson stepped forward into an art deco foyer , and the door shut behind him . " All right , " Tare said gruffly , opening a door across the foyer and leaning through it to look at Wilson . " Get in here . " " What 's wrong ? " " Well , to begin with , you 've been wandering around without a phone when they 've declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even after they ordered us to leave , I hung around because she called to say you were on your way here . " Wilson leaned back against the bulletproof glass of the door . What an idiot you 've been , Wilson thought . Images of Ellen and Jason spun through his head . " Look , " Tare said , a hint of kindness creeping into his tone , " come up to my office and we 'll try to figure out how to get out of this . " " D' you have a phone ? " " Yeah . C'm on , " Tare said . " We 'll take the stairs . You can never tell if the power 'll go off . " 41 . The sound of the speedboat 's engine almost drowned out the cellphone . Swansea had to shout , " I said I ca n't monitor him anymore . " " The National Guard has disabled the cellphone towers all around the nogo zone , " the fatherly voice said , straining to be heard . " So the tracker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to be less than two kilometers away from him to pick him up again . " " Ridiculous ! " Swansea shouted . " Put me through to that National Guard general , the one whose brother is on our board . " " Just a moment . just a moment , " the synthetic voice intoned. 42 . " The phone 's dead , " Wilson said , looking sheepishly over at Tare . " What ? " " No dial tone . " Wilson handed the set over . Tare put it to his ear . " Somebody must have knocked out the system . " " Jesus Christ , what am I going to do ? " Wilson looked out the window and rubbed his forehead . " I 've got to get hold of Ellen somehow . " " You never learn , do you , Wilson ? This is what you get for running off without checking out what 's going on around you . " " What ? " Wilson wondered what the hell Tare was going on about . " I bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major contributor to the governor 's campaign , did you ? " " Well , what 's that got to do with anything ? " Tare looked up at the ceiling and shook his head angrily , then gazed back at Wilson . " You heard about the governor getting arrested for running an illegal arms smuggling operation in the nogo . " Tare raised his eyebrows . " No , of course you did n't . Because you were n't interested . " Wilson shook his head . " No , no - you 're wrong . It 's this deprogramming stuff . It 's like I 'm just starting to wake up . " Tare frowned and took a deep breath . " Look , I do n't blame you for what happened to Rico . You were just the guy who isolated karatonin . I respect you for that . Maybe it 'll even do some good , some day . " But programming or no programming , you 're not the kind of guy who pays any attention to the big picture . Now you listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We were working for a very corrupt company . They were trying to come up with a drug that would make everybody responsible enough so they could get rid of the government . And they were willing to buy anybody to do it . Fortunately , they were so full of programming that they kept talking past each other , and never got as much done as people who 'd never been programmed at all . " " Stop it , " Wilson said , as though Tare were Jason , caught in the act of banging his head against the padded side of his crib . " The big picture is that the project was a failure . We tried to save a kid who grew up in the zone , and we were n't able to do it . " Tare laughed derisively . " Is that what you think ? " he laughed again . " It was n't a failure - it was too much of a success ! Did n't they ever show you Rico 's diaries ? " Wilson shook his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It figures . " Tare frowned again . " That was one of the things I had Rico do as part of his daily routine . Toward the last , he started thinking he was Jesus and that he had to die to save the world . It must have gotten worse when they started giving him all the religious bullshit . " " But we were giving him such small doses .... " Tare nodded . he was about to say something , when he was interrupted by a whooshing sound out in the street , rapidly followed by an explosion . ... ; " Get down , damn it ! " Tare shouted , dropping to the floor . Outside there was another whooshing sound , and Tare lurched forward , knocking Wilson off his feet . This explosion was closer . Windows rattled so hard they cracked , and the whole building shook . " RPGs , " Tare said . " : " What 's that ? " " Never in the service , huh ? " " No . " " I was a Marine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks away there was a heavy , mechanical coughing . " What was that ? " Wilson asked . " A machine gun . " Wilson got up on his hands and knees . " Sounds like they 're coming this way . " Tare edged toward the window and glanced down at the street , then turned back toward Wilson . " Let 's get out of here . If we 're fast , we might be able to stay ahead of " em . " 43 De Hagen had just gotten through the police line and a couple of blocks into town when he heard the explosions and the automatic weapons fire . he stepped into the boarded-up doorway of an abandoned store , got out his phone , and accessed the AI . " This is artificial intelligence , " the sim announced . " De Hagen here . I 'm in downtown Long Beach and there 's some kind of gun fight - " Another explosion sounded , this time only a few blocks away . " What 's going on here ? " " You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come under attack by one of the weapons syndicates operating in the nogo zone . " " What about the prospect ? " The phone murmured electronically until the sim added , " We have established contact . he is approximately nine blocks north of you , and proceeding in your direction . " " Show me a map . " De Hagen held out the phone so he could see its screen ; the AI displayed a map of central Long Beach , with a blinking dot to indicate Wilson 's location . he put the phone back to his ear and said , " I 'm going to go up and meet him . He 's far enough away from where the fighting 's going on so it should be safe . " " We do not recommend this course of action . " " Well , it 's about all I can do . " " Wait . Wait . " The sim murmured . " Alert . We have detected another party searching for the same prospect . Alert . " " Who is it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sirens wailed around them . A few blocks away there was an intense exchange of automatic weapons fire . Tare turned to look over his shoulder at Wilson and said , " We 're going to stop when we get to the end of the alley . If it looks clear , then we run across the street at an angle to reach the alley on the next block . " " Okay . " Tare ran past the trash cans and halted at the side of the building . He motioned Wilson forward , and then glanced around the corner . The street was empty . Wilson stopped behind him , leaning against the Avail . Behind them , maybe five blocks away , there was another RPG blast followed by more machine gun fire . " You see the alley ? " Tare asked , pointing . Wilson nodded . " Let 's go . " Tare darted out into the sunshine . Wilson jogged after him . Somebody had dropped a box full of leaflets in the middle of the street . Tare dodged the pile of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the fliers bore the slogan " Save the NoGo . " " Hurry up , " Tare shouted from the entrance to the alley . Wilson nodded and joined him . " Halt ! " somebody shouted from behind them . Wilson turned to see a slightly built man dressed entirely in black , including , despite the heat , a ski mask . he held some kind of rifle pointed in their direction . " So what are you high-powered consumers doing out here on this fine day ? " asked the man in black . " Shopping 's been canceled for the duration , in case you had n't noticed . " The man walked closer . " What do you want ? " Tare asked angrily . " Ah . " The man shifted his gaze to Tare . " So you 're the alpha male shopper , huh ? " he lifted up the gun and held it with both hands . " Look , " Tare went on , " you 've got to realize that there are people after us . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tare shook his head . " No they 're not . There 's some kind of security outfit after us . " " The hell you say , " the other growled , lowering his gun . " You 're no posse of the uprising . " " You do n't understand , " Wilson began . Tare grabbed Wilson 's shirt and almost growled , " Shut up . Let me handle this . " Tare loosened his grip on Wilson 's shirt and turned toward the man with the gun . " You got ta understand , " Tare said , speaking a little too loudly , " that this guy is full of microspores . D' you know what that means ? " The man in the mask shook his head . " They 've got him tagged . They can follow him with satellites if they have to . " " Just a minute - " Wilson started to say , but stopped when Tare turned and glared at him . " Well , then . Since you 're not shoppers , you better have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gun , the man in black loosened his backpack from one shoulder , reached inside it , and handed over a beat-up , yellowed paperback . Tare would n't touch it , so Wilson took the book . It was an old science fiction novel that he 'd read in high school - The World of Null- ? by A. E. van Vogt . " This is the book that started the nogo business , " Wilson said quietly , recalling that he 'd read it in his eleventh grade social studies class . " Bullshit , " Tare muttered . " Listen , you shopper asshole , " the man in black said , lifting his gun and resting it in the crook of his elbow , " you understand that book , and you understand everything we 're about ! No cops ! No government ! No taxes ! " " If that was such a good bunch of ideas , " Tare replied , " then why are you running around with an antique stun gun like that , dressed up like a ninja nursemaid ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised his gun and took aim at Tare 's chest . 45 . " I think that 's them in the alley , Ms. Swansea . " The state trooper braked to a stop , then stared intently at the telephoto screen set in the dashboard . " Looks like the guy they 're talking to has a piece . " " Officer , " Allison said , almost biting her tongue to keep from raging against the man 's overly cautious approach , " turn on your siren and move forward down the alley . " " That 's not our procedure , ma'am , " the officer said calmly . " I know these young radicals . They scare easy . We 'll have - " The National Guard captain sitting in the back seat interrupted her to say , " Looks like they 've seen us . " Swansea glanced at the screen , then looked out through the windshield . The man in black had knocked down one of the two figures - she could n't tell if it was Wilson or his companion - and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the patrol car and began jogging toward the two figures . Wilson was helping Tare to his feet when Swansea reached them . " Tony , " she began , trying to catch her breath . " I 'm so glad you 're all right . " " Allison , " Wilson replied , looking baffled . " What are you doing here ? " " I -I followed you . " Tare frowned . " I told you , Wilson . You 're full of spores . I was n't just bluffing . " The captain from the National Guard , dressed in camouflage , walked up and inspected each of them briefly with his deep-set eyes . " Ms. Swansea , I 'd be grateful if you 'd get back in the vehicle . Gentlemen , there 's a state of martial law here , and I 'll have to ask you to join us . We want to get everybody out of harm 's way . " he smiled at them and gestured back down the alley . As they walked toward the car , Swansea turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much I care for people who work for me ? I did this to make sure you were okay , Tony . " " Thanks , Allison . I 'm grateful . But I 'm never going back to Pharos again . I 've made my decision , and it stands . " " What are you talking about ? " She swiveled toward him and said in a commanding tone , " You 'll be able to take charge of a whole new project ! " Wilson shook his head . " You ca n't use your command voice on me anymore , Allison . I 've been deprogrammed . " Allison turned away , frowning . At first Wilson thought she was dazed . But as they drove through the vacant streets toward the waterfront , he began to think she was just disappointed . The expression made her look twenty years older . 46 . De Hagen rubbed his eyes , waiting for Wilson to phone him . As he sat there , de Hagen listened again to the recording of Allison Swansea reporting over her unsecured cellphone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . just as well that he had n't been able to reach Wilson during the riot ; Wilson did n't need to know that Avatar had been following him in Long Beach , right along with Pharos. just as well that it stayed that way . De Hagen looked at his wristwatch . Wilson was supposed to call in ten seconds . Quietly he counted them down . The phone rang , and de Hagen touched the " talk " button . " This is de Hagen . " " I want to accept the job , " Wilson said . " Are you ready to fax over the signed contract ? " " Yeah . Standby . " De Hagen could hear Wilson punching in the fax number , and his printer hummed and began extruding paper . As the contract was printing out , de Hagen said , " I wanted to tell you I read that article you published on autism a couple of years ago . " " What did you think ? " Wilson 's voice sounded strained , as though the subject were awkward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a project on brain damage repair that 's working along the kind of approach you wrote about - you know , finding a software solution to a hardware problem . " " Interesting . " Wilson sounded merely polite . " Well , I thought I 'd mention the article to our management . You would n't be able to take part in that project until you 've finished with the Alzheimer 's program you 're assigned to . But I thought you 'd want to know about the other project . " " I really appreciate that . I ca n't tell you how much I 'm looking forward to - just working in a place where everything 's just - well , straightforward . You know what I mean . " A woman 's voice called in the distance . " Tony - come quick ! Jason 's smiling ! " " Thanks for everything , " Wilson said . " I 've got to go . " De Hagen put the phone down and glanced around the hotel room . He 'd set the walls on a psychotropic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't doing any good . Recruiting always made him feel inferior to the people he was trying to hire . " It is now 11:30 , " his wristwatch announced , " and you must leave for the airport immediately . " That was when de Hagen made his big mistake . he stood there smiling and admitted that he 'd finally caught somebody who could run the brain damage project that would release him from the programming insert in his skull . That set off the fireworks , and when he tried to tell himself that he 'd finally done some good for someone , he could almost hear the programming shouting back in a perfect simulation of his father 's voice , " You 're never going to hurt anybody ever again ! " Ochre and magenta clouds billowed around him as the programming beat him down against the carpet . " You must leave for the airport immediately , " the watch said once more . That called him back from oblivion . he lay there on the floor , struggling to breathe like a man pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was the word . Focus on that word and clear the program . Saved . Yes , that was the word , de Hagen told himself . <p>
