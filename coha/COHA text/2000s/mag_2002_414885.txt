**25;1306;TOOLONG Morgan Weistling believes that his talent for drawing aids his success in painting figures in oil . <p> It was evident at an early age that Morgan Weistling had a love of drawing and a natural talent for it as well . Even before he was 2 years old , the boy 's father , a former art student , would help him draw . When he got older , Weistling would analyze books that his father had saved from his art school days . Later , he studied with famed illustrator Fred Fixler , who taught his students to draw from life . That intense instruction helped Weistling land a job as an illustrator at a top movie-poster agency while he was still a student . He worked in the industry for about 14 years before deciding to try painting without an art director ; he wanted to paint just for himself . His first piece was snapped up by the first gallery he visited , and from that moment on , the artist was committed to a new career in painting , concentrating on figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an illustrator helped him to learn the fundamentals of fine art  --  the basics that every painter must master . For any painting , he stresses , an understanding of shapes , values , edges , and then color is essential . He believes that learning to see shapes abstractly , apart from subject matter , is especially important for capturing the essence of what artists see in front of them . As for values , he narrows his down to just a few . " In nature , there is a limitless number of gradual steps of value to turn a form , " he notes . " But we are restricted by crude paints , so we must simplify . " Weistling sticks to five or six values for a painting , using three for the lights and two or three for shadows . <p> For figures especially , he executes several types of edges to suggest texture , as well as lead a viewer 's eye through the work . " I 'll go for a hard edge if there is high contrast , such as in light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fatty portions of the body , such as a cheek , I need a soft edge , because the light carries across the form , " explains the artist . " I paint firm edges where the body is muscular or bony , such as the bridge of the nose , but when one form merges with another , where the edge is practically invisible , I need a lost edge . An example of this would be a dark-haired model with a dark background , where the hair just seems to disappear . " <p> Weistling says that getting color correct is an aspect of painting that most artists want to learn right away , but he feels that other basics need to be emphasized first . " Unless you get shapes , values , and edges mastered , you might as well be painting with ketchup and mustard because that is how important color is in comparison , " he asserts . " If you observe shapes and place them correctly , establish simple values , and have a variety of edges that please the viewer 's eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was trained to observe color from life by constantly painting from life . Values are the key to getting the correct color . If you do n't get the values right , you wo n't be able to capture the color that you see . " <p> When Weistling chooses his colors , they are from his basic palette of oils , mainly Winsor &; Newton titanium white , cadmium yellow pale , cadmium yellow , cadmium red , alizarin crimson , yellow ochre , yellow ochre pale , raw sienna , terra rosa , raw umber , viridian , cerulean blue , cobalt blue , French ultramarine , and ivory black . He also uses Rembrandt transparent oxide brown . A thick piece of glass serves as his palette , and he places Masonite that has been gessoed a neutral gray underneath it . Taking safety precautions with his materials , the artist uses Turpenoid and holds his cleanup rag with a rubber-gloved hand to keep paint from absorbing into his skin . " I use a Sharper Image Quadra Air Cleaner in my studio as well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulls out of the air . " <p> As for brushes , Weistling prefers long-handled filbert and flat bristles up to 1 1/2 ? wide from the Robert Simmons Signet series . He also uses mongoose-hair brushes by Langnickel in all sizes , both flat and filbert , citing that in the darker areas of a piece , these brushes help to keep the paint thin so that the edges wo n't reflect light . " It can be very distracting having one 's brushstrokes pick up highlights , thus destroying the true value of the paint that was mixed , " he says . Weistling always tries to simplify what he sees , interpret it with minimal values , and omit minor details . He wants the personality of his subjects to shine . " It 's not in what you say , but in what you do n't say , " he advises . " Edit out the unimportant . " <p> When painting in his studio , the artist prefers acrylic-primed Claessens linen canvas , which he buys in rolls and stretches himself ; for outdoor work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weistling paints indoors , mainly because of his subject matter . His inspiration comes from the lifestyle of pioneers who lived during the Civil War era and the early 1900s . Weistling poses his models in custom-made costumes that are authentic to the period portrayed in his painting . He traces the Old West influence in his work to regional painters whom he has studied and admired including James Bama , Frank McCarthy , and Tom Lovell . He also draws inspiration from John Singer Sargent , Anders Zorn , Nicolai Fechin , Joaquin Sorolla , and many artists from the golden era of illustration , notably Dean Cornwell and N.C. Wyeth . <p> Weistling has won numerous awards for his paintings , including the 2002 Trustees Purchase Award from the Autry Museum Masters of the American West competition , the 2001 Nona Jean Hulsey Buyers Choice Award , and the 2001 Prix de West Purchase Award from the Oklahoma National Cowboy Hall of Fame Prix de West Invitational . The artist is represented by Trailside Galleries in Scottsdale , Arizona , and Jackson Hole , Wyoming .

DEMONSTRATION : SLEEPING SARAH <p> Step 1 . Weistling started this portrait with the model 's head , then calibrated the body measurements accordingly . " I used filbert sables to lay down some of the flesh tones , thinned with Turpenoid , " he explains . " I quickly roughed out the general size and position of the head on the canvas . I was not doing any serious drawing yet . I think of this step as though I were a sculptor , and this was my first lump of clay . " <p> Step 2 . Now the artist concentrated on the specifics of each shape . With this portion of the painting finished , he judged the rest of his measurements . " I squinted at the model to see shapes and values in simpler terms , " recalls the artist . " All the while , I was aware of the overall color harmonies that were affecting the head and figure  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistent throughout my color mixing . I began to work with small filbert bristle brushes on areas requiring less pinpoint accuracy . " <p> Step 3 . In this step , Weistling was n't concerned with technical aspects of the painting ; his focus was capturing the model 's essence . " I assessed if I had correctly stated the impression of her head as I saw it when I took a quick glance at her , " he says . " The way I applied the paint came naturally when I did n't think about it and instead continued to hone in on the shapes that make Sarah uniquely her . It was not about the details , though ; it was getting those things right that would make her recognizable in a group photo from a distance . " <p> Step 4 . The artist slowly worked his way across the canvas , trying to identify the positive and negative shapes . " I never moved on until I was happy with what was already on the canvas , " Weistling explains . " Here , I washed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately worked wet-in-wet and finished it off . This method allowed for softer edges and gave a looser quality to the work . " <p> Step 5 . Now that Weistling had established the most complex areas , he turned to secondary focal points that frame the model , such as the pillows and background . " The brushwork here is the result of careful measuring and working to achieve an accurate observation of what I was looking at , " says the artist . " I held my brush out and looked for plumb lines that would indicate where the next stroke would go . For example , I was concerned with the girl 's book and the flowers only as shapes that were placed accurately in relation to the figure . By holding my brush out horizontally , I checked that the bottom edge of the book lined up just above her elbow " <p> Step 6 . After Weistling laid in the fruit bowl , he concentrated on finishing details , such as the corners of the painting . " I made sure the color harmony and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artist . " When looking back on this stage , I think that if I would have stopped here , it would have had a more spontaneous , but still complete , look .
