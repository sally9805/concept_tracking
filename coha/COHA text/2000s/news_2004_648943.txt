<p> Two hours before the start of the Eastern Conference finals , under a bright sun that warmed the moist air to 88 degrees , a band played on a stage alongside a hockey arena next to a row of palm trees in flower beds , across the street from a water channel filled with pleasure boats . <p> " Wasting away again in Margaritaville , " the singer sang , as fans , some sweating in baggy black jerseys , danced to the beat . Above them , banners displayed pictures of the Stanley Cup alongside the words Beyond Belief . <p> What is the sports world to believe of the Tampa Bay Lightning , a team making its first appearance in the N.H.L. 's final four and leading the Philadelphia Flyers , 1-0 , going into Game 2 of the series in the St. Pete Times Forum on Monday night ? <p> The positive spin might be that hockey can succeed anywhere and draw sellout audiences even in a subtropical climate in midspring . It could also be that even a mismanaged and underfinanced expansion franchise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into an example of efficient spending and wise blending of personnel . <p> Or , a skeptic might suggest that hockey has become an overextended novelty show that sacrifices mainstream attention in pursuit of midsized markets as its southward continental drift melts its once-frozen grip on its traditional fan base . <p> Ron Campbell did not seem too concerned with these cosmic questions inside the modern , air-conditioned arena Saturday afternoon . Campbell , the president of the Lightning , is a self-described bean-counter with an accounting background , and he was busy counting the house . <p> " This is the first hockey game today that someone ca n't walk up and buy a ticket since we 've been here , " Campbell said , referring to the ownership group that took over in 1999 . " It 's not a one-time hit . We 're trying to build a business . We 're building a fan base . We 're building memories . We 're building a generation of fans . " <p> Saturday 's attendance of 21,425 was an arena record for hockey . If nothing else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but colorful history . The team is owned by Palace Sports and Entertainment , which owns the Detroit Pistons and turned that franchise from a local joke in the 1970 's into a league champion in the 1980 's . <p> No one else runs basketball and hockey teams in two markets . Under the ownership of Bill Davidson , the Palace group in 1999 bought a hockey team born in 1992 under chaotic circumstances . The initial down payment of $3 million on the $50 million expansion fee came from an English duke recruited by Phil Esposito , the first general manager . <p> " Two weeks after the league meeting I got a call from the league informing me that the duke 's check had bounced , " Esposito wrote in his memoir " Thunder and Lightning " ( Triumph Books , 2003 ) . " We had been had . " <p> Eventually , Esposito recruited Japanese investors , but his team did not have a major league rink . It played its first season at a fairgrounds coliseum that sat 10,000 fans and also played host to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner , was briefly involved in the management while under suspension by Major League Baseball . <p> As a publicity stunt , Esposito hired a female goalie , Manon Rheaume , who played part of one exhibition game . The Lightning next moved to a domed baseball stadium and occasionally drew crowds of more than 25,000 . <p> But the team was underfinanced and reached the playoffs only once in its first 10 seasons , losing in the first round in 1996 . A second ownership group arrived and sold after less than one year . When the Palace group took over in early 1999 , the Lightning already had a star to build around . <p> He was Vincent Lecavalier , a talented and telegenic rookie center from Ile Bizard , Quebec , who wore No. 4 in honor of Jean Beliveau . The Lightning added two more stars from Quebec  --  Martin St. Louis as a free agent and Brad Richards in the draft  --  and a Russian goalie , Nikolai Khabibulin , in a trade . <p> Then came Dave Andreychuk , a native of Hamilton , Ontario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free agent in 2001 . The final piece was the acquisition of defenseman Darryl Sydor , acquired by trade with Columbus in January . <p> John Tortorella , who took over as coach in January 2001 , took away Lecavalier 's captaincy and gave it to Andreychuk . He asked Andreychuk to change his role from scorer to checker and demanded that Lecavalier tailor his individual talent to a team concept . <p> Tom Wilson , president of the Palace group , said that Tortorella " took on Vinnie Lecavalier in a war of wills " and that most coaches would have been afraid to do it . <p> " And here 's a guy in his first real job saying : ' You know what ? He 's going to learn to play in the right way , ' " Wilson said . " Vinnie may have struggled with that for a while but , ultimately , John 's a better coach because of how Vinnie is and Vinnie 's a better player because of the experience . " <p> Davidson ; Wilson ; Campbell ; the general manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only Canadian in the chain of command is Bill Barber , the director of player personnel . Curiously , the only American player in uniform Saturday was John Grahame , the backup goalie who did not play . They perform regularly for an audience being weaned from free tickets , deep discounts and two-for-one promotions under a scoreboard that still explains icing and offside . <p> St. Louis , a finalist for the N.H.L. 's Most Valuable Player award , said : " I think they 're starting to get it . It 's fairly new down here . There 's a lot of snowbirds . " <p> Andreychuk said many of those northern transplants cheer for visiting teams like the Rangers or Boston . <p> " We feed off that , " he said . " We 're starting to convert some of those people . " <p> Lecavalier said : " It 's grown every single year since I started here at 18 . Especially now , everyone 's in the streets telling me ' Good luck ' and ' We 're going to be at the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling the sport is part of his role . " I 'm by no means a salesman , " he said . " If this organization is going about it the right way , it sells itself . You make your own bed . You need to win . " <p> Feaster , the general manager , said : " I think we had one or two official sellouts during the first two rounds . Our market has been overpromised and underdelivered to for so long . " <p> The season-ticket base is still under 10,000 , Campbell said , adding that regular-season gate receipts , not including revenue from luxury boxes , were about $21.5 million . <p> The team made the playoffs last season and won a round for the first time . This season , it won the conference championship with a payroll of $33.5 million , in the bottom third of the league . Although the Lightning projected a $10 million loss this season , the playoff success could allow it to at least break even , Wilson said . <p> The arena , which opened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerts and other events . Its location has spurred land development in the neighborhood , including a major hotel across the street and restaurants nearby . <p> But will the Lightning 's success build deep roots or prove ephemeral , as was the case in Miami when the Florida Panthers reached the Stanley Cup finals in 1996 before sliding back to the edge of local consciousness ? <p> Wilson , the Lightning 's Michigan-based chief executive , said : " If you look at Tampa , you might say , ' There 's a good example of a city that should n't have a hockey team . ' But then , all of a sudden , you have a successful team and you see how a city can get excited . <p> " It 's a good city that should have a hunger for good product . We went in there with 20 years of experience as pretty good marketers . It was a painful journey for a longer time than we ever anticipated . Big picture , we have done so much right .
