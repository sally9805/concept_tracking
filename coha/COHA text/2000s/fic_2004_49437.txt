" TO CATCH A STAR , YOU must know its secret name and its place in the heavens , " whispered Merlin , his mouth so close to Nimue 's ear his breath tickled her and made her want to laugh . Only the seriousness of the occasion stopped a giggle . Finally , after years of apprenticeship , Merlin was about to tell her what she had always wanted to know , what she worked toward for seven long years . <p> " You must send the name to the sky as a white bird . You must write it in fire upon a mirror . You must wrap the falling star with your heart 's desire . All this must be done in the single moment between the end of night and the dawning of the day . " <p> " That 's it ? " breathed Nimue . " The final secret ? " <p> " Yes , " said Merlin slowly . " The final secret . But remember the cost . Your heart 's desire will be consumed by the star . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But my heart 's desire is to have the power ! " exclaimed Nimue . " How can I gain it and lose it at the same time ? " <p> " Even Magi may not know their own hearts , " said Merlin heavily . " And it will be the whole desire of your heart , from past , present , or future . You will be giving up something that may yet come to pass if you choose not to take a star from the sky . " <p> Merlin looked at her as she stared up at the sky , watching the stars . He saw a young woman , with the dark face and hair of a Pict , her eyes flashing with excitement . She was not beautiful , nor even pretty , but her face was strong and lively and every movement hinted at energy barely contained . She wore a plain white dress , sleeveless but stretching to her ankles , and bracelets of twisted gold wire and amethysts . Merlin had given her the bracelets , and they were invested with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last three years . <p> There were other things that Merlin saw , out of memory and with the gift he had taken from a falling star . <p> There was the past , beginning when a headstrong girl no more than fourteen years old sought him out in his simple house upon the Cornish headland . He had turned her away , but she had sat on his doorstep for weeks , living off shellfish and seaweed , till at last he had relented and taken her in . At first he had refused to teach her magic , but she had won that battle as well . He could not deny that she had the gift , and he could not deny that he enjoyed the teaching . Over the years that enjoyment in teaching her had become something else , though Merlin had never shown it . He was nearly three times her age , and he had spent many years before Nimue 's arrival preparing himself for the sorrow that must come . He had not expected it to be as straightforward as simply falling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There was the present , the two of them standing upon the black stone with the new Sun shining down upon them . <p> The future , so many possible roads stretching out in all directions . If he wished , Merlin could try to steer Nimue toward one future . But he did not . The choice would be hers . <p> " My heart 's desire is to gain full mastery of the Art , " Nimue said slowly , " I can only gain that mastery by the capture of a star , yet that capture depends upon the sacrifice of my heart 's desire . An interesting conundrum . " <p> " You should stay here and think on it , " said Merlin . He stepped down from the black stone , the centerpiece of the ring of stones that he had built almost twenty years before . The black stone had been the most difficult , though it was small and flat , unlike the standing monoliths of granite . He had drawn it out of the very depths of the Earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced it into its current shape . " But breakfast calls me and I wish to answer . " <p> Nimue smiled and sat cross-legged on the stone . She watched Merlin as he walked away . As he left the ring of stones , the air shimmered around him , bright shafts of light weaving and dancing around his head and arms . The light sank into his hair and skin , and when it finally settled , Merlin 's hair was white and he appeared to be much older than he really was . It was a magical disguise he had long assumed , Nimue knew . Age was associated with wisdom , and Merlin had also found it useful to appear aged and infirm . Nimue expected she would probably do the same when she came into her power . A crone was always much more convincing than a maiden . <p> Not that she expected to be a maiden too much longer . Nimue had her own plans for that step from maiden to woman grown . Merlin was part of that plan , though he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Arthur 's warriors would do for Nimue . Merlin was the only man she had ever wanted in her bed . There had been some who had tried to influence her choice over the past few years , against all her discouragement . A few were still around , croaking and sunning their warty hides down in the reedy margins of the lake . Nimue was surprised they had lived so long . Most men died from such transformations . Sometimes she fed them flies , but she never let them touch her , either as toads or men . <p> Nimue turned her thoughts from failed suitors back to the conundrum presented by Merlin . Her heart 's desire was to have the power , yet she would lose her heart 's desire to gain the power . How could this be ? <p> She scratched her head and lay down on the rock , letting the heat from the Sun fall upon her . Unconsciously , she turned her palms up to catch the rays . The Sun was a source of power , one she used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sun 's power when the sky was clear , and she no longer even needed to think about it . Nimue could draw power from many sources : the Sun , the Earth , the moving stream , even the spent breath of animals and men . <p> What had Merlin lost ? Nimue wondered . What was his heart 's desire ? He must have wanted the power as she wanted it . He had gained it , and as far as she could see , he had lost nothing . He was the preeminent wizard of the age . The counselor and maker of Kings . There was no knowledge he did not have , no spell he did not know . <p> Perhaps there was nothing to lose , Nimue thought . Or if there was , it would be something she would never miss . A heart 's desire that could come to pass but did not was no loss . To see the future was not the same as to live it . Perhaps she would see her heart 's desire in the hearth fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of a loss was that ? <p> Nothing , thought Nimue . Nothing compared to the exhilaration of magic . <p> " Tonight , " she whispered and she curled up on the black stone like a cat resting up in preparation for extensive wickedness . " Tonight , for everything . " <p> MERLIN WAS NOT ASLEEP when she came to his chamber . He lay on his bed , but his eyes were open , gleaming in the thin shaft of moonlight from the tower window . Nimue hesitated at the door , suddenly shy and afraid . She had chosen to come naked , but with her long dark hair artfully arranged both to cover and suggest . She had taken a long time to get her hair exactly right , and it was held in place with charms as well as pins . <p> " Merlin , " she whispered . <p> Merlin did not respond . Nimue drifted into the room . Her skin seemed to glow with an inner light and her smile promised many pleasures . Any man would rise and take her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Merlin . I shall go to the black rock before the dawn . But I would go as a woman , who has known her man . Your woman . " <p> " No , " whispered Merlin . He did not move , but lay as still as the chalk-carving on the green of the hill . " There are men aplenty in the village . Two of Arthur 's knights are visiting tonight . They are both good men , young and unmarried . " <p> Nimue shook her head and stepped forward . Her hair fell aside as she knelt by the bed , her magic dissolving and the pins unable to hold on their own . <p> " It is you I want , " she said fiercely . " You ! No one else . You want me too ! I know it , as well as I know the ten thousand names of the beasts and the birds that you have taught me . " <p> " I do , " whispered Merlin . " But I am your teacher , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unequal in years and power . Go back to your own place . " <p> Nimue frowned . Then she rose and stamped her foot , then whirled away , light and shadows dancing in her wake . At the door , she looked back and her smile shone through the dark room . <p> " Tomorrow , I shall be my own mistress and you will not be master , " said Nimue . " I will catch my star and we can be as man and wife . " <p> Merlin did not move or answer . In an instant , Nimue was gone , and the room was silent once more . The shaft of moonlight slowly crawled over Merlin 's face , and darkness hid the tears that welled up out of his clear blue eyes . Young man 's eyes , unclouded by age or glamour . <p> " Ah well , " he muttered to himself . " Ah well . " <p> They were the words Merlin 's father had said upon his deathbed . Simple words , devoid of magic , greeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nimue did not go back to her own bed . Instead she put on her best linen dress , that she had dyed herself , blue from isatis bark , and stitched with silver thread that she had spun out of the deep earth . <p> That thread shone in the moonlight as she slipped out of the house and on to the headland . There was a pool at the edge of the western cliff , a pool of soft water , fed by spring and rain . It was always placid , mirrorlike , in sharp contrast to the sea that crashed on the rocks only a few paces away , but two hundred feet below . An ancient hawthorn tree leaned over the pool , all shadows and spiky branches . It had often been mistaken in the dark for a giant , or some fell creature . Every midwinter night , some hapless stranger would seek to use the power of the pool , only to flee in panic from the hawthorn . Invariably they found the cliff-edge and the pounding sea that would grind their bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pool and hugged herself against the bite of the wind , cold in this early morning . She whispered to herself , preparing for what must be done . <p> To find the secret name of a star <p> Ask the Moon that shares the sky <p> Fix its place between the branches of the hawthorn tree <p> Send the name to the sky on the wings of a bird <p> Burn the name in fire upon the mirrored waters of the lake <p> Wrap the star with heart 's desire <p> Between the darkness and the light <p> Then you shall a magus be .... <p> Nimue looked up to the heavens , and found the great disc of the Moon , yellow as ancient cheese . She let its light fall upon her face and open hands , and took in its power . But a yellow Moon was not what she sought . She waited , silent , the hawthorn tree softly groaning in the wind , the surf crashing deep below . <p> Slowly the Moon began to sink and change . The yellow faded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the change , and smiled . Soon she would ask it to name her star . She had already chosen one . A bright star , but not so bright it might overpower her . Not the Evening Star , that served no one and never would . But a star as bright as Merlin 's , though not as red . She would be his equal in power , if not in kind . <p> A bird called , the sleepy cry of something woken before its time . The wind fell and the hawthorn stilled . Nimue felt a tremor rush through her . Dawn was only minutes away . The Moon was silver , she must act . <p> She called to the Moon , a call that no human ears could hear . At first , there was no answer , but she had expected that . She called again , using the power she 'd drawn earlier from the Sun . The Moon grew a fraction brighter at the call , and through the void , her silver voice came down , quiet and imbued with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> As the name formed in her head , Nimue sank to one knee and looked up through the branches of the hawthorn . There , in the fork where two twisted branches met , she saw her star , bright between two strands of darkness . <p> Nimue splashed her hand in the pool and the droplets flew into the air to become a white bird , a dove whose wings made a drum-roll as it rose straight up toward the sky , the name of the star held in its beak where once it would have carried an olive branch . <p> The pool was still before Nimue 's hand left it , still and shining , reflecting the woman , the tree , the Moon and sky . With her forefinger and all that was left of the Sun 's power within her , Nimue wrote in fire upon the mirrored water , the three runes that spelled out the name " Ja-hal-iel . " <p> In the heavens , a star fell . The Moon sank , and the Sun rose . <p> In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bound it forever with the promise of her heart 's desire . <p> She felt something leave her , and tears started in her eyes . But she did not know what she had lost , and the exultation of power was upon her . <p> Nimue ran to the cliff top and threw herself into the air . Like a feather she drifted down , buffeted this way and that by the wind , but taking no harm . Before the cold water embraced her , she became a dolphin , plunging into a wave , sliding under the water to spin out the other side , laughing as only a dolphin can . <p> Nimue had been a dolphin before , but it was Merlin who had made her so . It was his star 's power that had given her the shapes of many things , on sea and air and land . Now she could transform herself at will . She jumped again and between two waves became a hawk , shooting up above the spray . A merlin , to be exact , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sped across the headland , past the pool , toward the rising Sun and Merlin . <p> With sharp hawk eyes she saw he had already risen , and was waiting for her in the ring of stones . He stood upon the black rock , without a glamour upon him , and Nimue felt love for him rise in her heart as bright and strong as the rising Sun . <p> She flew still higher , till she was directly above Merlin and he had to shade his eyes to look at her . Then she folded her wings and dropped straight down , down into his open arms . <p> They had one kiss , one brief embrace , before the stars they wore pushed them apart , the air itself wrenching them from each other 's grasp . Nimue shouted and directed her will upon her new-found power , to no avail . She was pushed completely off the black stone , to fall sprawling in the circle . <p> Merlin did not shout . He had fallen on his back , and was sinking into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , but some peaty bog that had trapped an unwary traveler . <p> He did not shout , but his voice was loud and clear in Nimue 's ear as she struggled to her feet . <p> " You were my heart 's desire , Nimue , waiting in the future , you were the price I paid for the art . Love never to be fulfilled . Forgive me . " <p> His hand stretched up from the stone . Nimue snatched at it , as if even now she might somehow pull him back . But her hand closed on empty air , and his disappeared beneath the surface of the stone . <p> " Forgive me , Merlin , " whispered Nimue . She made no effort to stem the tears that fell upon the rock . A bright star shone in the hollow of her neck , the promise of power and wisdom beyond anything she had ever dreamed . But she was cold inside , cold with the knowledge that this power was not her heart 's desire . Her true heart 's desire lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Or was he ? Nimue clutched her star and looked up at the sky , so bright above her . If a star could be plucked from the sky , then surely it could also be made to rise again ? To take its place in the firmament once more , unraveling all the threads of time that had been woven in its fall . If she could return her star , then surely Merlin would freely walk the Earth , and he in turn could free his star and regain his heart 's desire . <p> There were other powers in the world . Other places to find knowledge . Nimue stretched her slim arms above her head and in a moment was a bird , wide-winged and far-sailing . She rode a wind west , across the open sea , and was gone from Britain . <p> With her went all Merlin 's wisdom and power , and all hope for the kingdom of Arthur . The kingdom would sink into ruin as Nimue 's heart 's desire had sunk into the stone . <p> Sidebar   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
