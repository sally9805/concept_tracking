RED ALERT // * * * // How the world is running // out of fresh water // Water has been an important symbol in the legends and histories of many ancient cultures . Unlike people living in the urban , industrialized nations of the 21st century , most humans throughout history knew that their water resources could run out , and they developed a healthy respect for conserving whatever water they found . In biblical times , when Isaac returned to the land where his father Abraham had lived , the old wells he opened up were so important to life that they became a subject of dispute with other tribespeople . Later , Jacob 's well was so highly prized and carefully protected that it was in use during the days of Jesus many centuries later . // Other societies , like the traditional Inuit and the early Mesopotamians , placed equal importance on the water that sustained the lives of their people . The Inuit depended largely on water-dwelling seals , fish , and walrus for their food , and their deity was a goddess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ferocious justice , and all of her power came from water . Nuliajuk gave the Inuit food from the sea and ice to build houses . When she withheld her gifts , no one could live . In the strikingly different world of the early Mesopotamians , water was treasured for different reasons . Before this group moved to the fertile valleys of northern Iraq , they lived in the dry plains of the south . They did manage to harness water for their farms , but it was very scarce . That is why their water-god , Enki , became one of the most important deities in their pantheon. // Thousands of miles away , in China , the dangers of drought became a theme of one myth , in which a Great Archer shot down nine out of ten suns , to prevent the earth from drying out . Chinese tradition also held that water and other elements of the earth exist in a balance that should not be disturbed . If there was a disruption in the normal cycles of Nature , Chinese governors were called upon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for the harm done to crops by reducing taxes or by distributing grain from the country 's storehouses . Today , the normal cycles of Nature are being disrupted by climate change and the abuse of almost every water system on earth . However , unlike governments that followed the Chinese tradition described above , our governments are abdicating their responsibility to protect and conserve water , and they are handing its management over to the private sector . // Corporate control of the world 's water resources and distribution systems is a threat to the well-being of humans around the world because water is fundamental to life . All living ecosystems are sustained by water and the hydrological cycle . Ancient peoples , and those living closer to the forces of Nature in today 's world , knew that to destroy water was to destroy self . Only modern " advanced " cultures , driven by acquisition and convinced of their supremacy over Nature , have failed to revere water . The consequences are evident in every corner of the globe : parched deserts and cities , destroyed wetlands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * * // Nature is not entirely benign , and like the water-goddess of the Inuit , it will not tolerate this abuse forever . The signs are all present . If we do not soon change our relationship to water and the ecosystems that sustain it , all our wealth and knowledge will be meaningless . We are as dependent on fresh water for life as our ancient ancestors were . But many do not seem to be aware that this precious resource is disappearing . The clock is ticking , but they do not know it . // Finite Supplies // We 'd like to believe there 's an infinite supply of fresh water on the planet , and many of us have used water as if it would never run out . But the assumption is tragically false . Available fresh water amounts to less than one-half of one percent of all the water on earth . The rest is sea water , frozen in the polar ice , or water stored in the ground that is inaccessible to us . The hard news is this : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fresh water resources so quickly and relentlessly that every species on earth  --  including our own  --  is in mortal danger . The earth 's water supply is finite . Not only is there the same amount of water on the planet as there was at its creation ; it is almost all the same water . Only a small amount may enter our atmosphere in the form of " snow comets " from the outer parts of the solar system . But even if the snow comet theory is correct , the speculated amount of water involved is so modest , it would do nothing to alleviate the shortage crisis . // The total amount of water on earth is approximately 1.4 billion cubic kilometers ( about 330 million cubic miles ) . Canadian naturalist E.C . Pielou helps us visualize this statistic : if all the water on earth were solidified into a cube , each edge of the cube would be about 1,120 kilometers ( about 695 miles ) long , approximately twice the length of Lake Superior . The amount of fresh water on earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8.6 million cubic miles ) , a mere 2.6 percent of the total . Of this , only 11 million cubic kilometers ( about 2.6 million cubic miles ) , or 0.77 percent , counts as part of the water cycle in that it circulates comparatively quickly . However , fresh water is renewable only by rainfall . So in the end , humans can rely only on the 34,000 cubic kilometers ( about 8,000 cubic miles ) of rain that annually form the " runoff " that goes back to the oceans via rivers and groundwater . This is the only water considered " available " for human consumption because it can be harvested without depleting finite water sources . // Rain forms a crucial part of the hydrological cycle , the process through which water circulates from the atmosphere to the earth and back , from a height of 15 kilometers ( about 9 miles ) above the ground to a depth of 5 kilometers ( 3 miles ) beneath it . Water that evaporates from the oceans and water systems of the continents goes into the atmosphere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into saturated water steams , which create clouds , and when those clouds cool , rain is formed . Raindrops fall on the earth 's surface and soak into the ground , where they become groundwater . This underground water , in turn , comes back to the earth 's surface in the form of sourcepoints for streams and rivers . Surface water and ocean water then evaporate into the atmosphere , starting the cycle anew . // Most of the earth 's fresh water , however , is stored underground , just below the surface or deeper down . This is called groundwater , and it is 60 times greater in volume than the water that lies on the earth 's surface . There are many types of groundwater , but the most important type for humans is " meteoric water "  --  moving groundwater that circulates as part of the water cycle , feeding above-ground rivers and lakes . Underground water reservoirs , which are known as aquifers , are relatively stable because they are secured in bodies of rock . Many of them are closed systems  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . Wells and boreholes drilled into aquifers are fairly secure sources of water because they tap into these large reservoirs , but to be useful over time , an aquifer must be replenished with new water at approximately the same rate as the rate of extraction . However , around the world , people are extracting groundwater at rapid rates to supplement declining supplies of surface water . // Multiple Threats // All of the above-noted water sources are being taxed to their limit for multiple reasons . First , the world 's population is exploding . Ten years from now , India will have an extra 250 million people and Pakistan 's population will almost double , to 210 million . In five of the world 's " hot spots " of water dispute  --  the Aral Sea region , the Ganges , the Jordan , the Nile , and the Tigris-Euphrates  --  the populations of the nations within each basin are projected to climb by between 45 and 75 percent by 2025 . By that year , China will see a population increase greater than the entire population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an additional 2.6 billion people  --  a 57 percent increase over today 's level of 6.1 billion . To feed this many human beings , says the UN 's Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , agricultural production will have to increase by 50 percent . In such a scenario , demand for fresh water will obviously explode . As Allerd Stikker of the Amsterdam-based Ecological Management Foundation explains , " The issue today , put simply , is that while the only renewable source of freshwater is continental rainfall ... a finite amount of water , the world population keeps increasing by roughly 85 million per year . Therefore the availability of freshwater per head is decreasing rapidly . " // Furthermore , increasing numbers of people are moving to cities , where dense populations place terrible strains on limited water supplies and make delivery of sanitation services next to impossible . For the first time in history , as many people now live in cities as in rural communities . There are 22 cities in the world with populations of over 10 million inhabitants . By 2030 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown 160 percent , and twice as many people will live in cities as in the countryside . // Second , as a result of many factors , per capita water consumption is exploding . Global consumption of water is doubling every 20 years , more than twice the rate of human population growth . Technology and sanitation systems , particularly those in the wealthy industrialized nations , have allowed people to use far more water than they need . The average Canadian household now consumes 500,000 liters of water every year ( about 130,000 US gallons ) ; each toilet  --  and many homes have more than one  --  uses 18 liters of water per flush ( about five US gallons ) . And enormous amounts of water are lost through leakage in municipal infrastructure in countries all over the world . Yet even with the explosion in personal water use , households and municipalities account for only 10 percent of water use . // * * * // Industry claims the next big chunk of the world 's fresh water supplies , at 20 to 25 percent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is predicted to double by 2025 if current growth trends persist . Massive industrialization is throwing off the balance between humans and Nature on many continents , especially in rural Latin America and Asia , where export-oriented agribusiness is claiming more and more of the water once used by small farmers for food self-sufficiency . Latin America and other Third World regions also host more than eight hundred free trade zones , where assembly lines produce goods for the global consumer elite , and these operations are another major drain on local water supplies . // Many of the world 's growing industries are water intensive . It takes 400,000 liters ( 105,000 US gallons ) of water to make one car . Computer manufacturers use massive quantities of de-ionized fresh water to produce their goods and are constantly searching for new sources . In the United States alone , the industry will soon be using over 1,500 billion liters ( 396 billion US gallons ) of water and producing over 300 billion liters ( 79 billion US gallons ) of wastewater each year . Originally thought to be a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legacy in its short history . Silicon Valley has more Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) toxic Superfund sites than any other area in the U.S. and more than 150 groundwater contamination sites , many related to high-tech manufacturing . Close to 30 percent of the groundwater beneath and around Phoenix , Arizona , has been contaminated , well over half by the high-tech sector . // Irrigation for crop production claims the remaining 65 to 70 percent of all water used by humans . While some of this water use is for small farms , particularly in the Third World , increasing amounts are being used for industrial farming , which notoriously overuses and wastes water . These corporate farming practices are subsidized by the governments of industrialized countries and their taxpayers , and this creates a strong disincentive for farm operations to move to conservation practices such as drip irrigation . Much of the water usage that comes under this 65 percent heading should really be considered industrial , since modern factory farms have very little resemblance to community farms in any part of the world . // In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , massive pollution of the world 's surface water systems has placed a great strain on remaining supplies of clean fresh water . Global deforestation , destruction of wetlands , the dumping of pesticides and fertilizers into waterways , and global warming are all taking a terrible toll on the earth 's fragile water systems . ( See Chapter 2 . ) Another source of pollution is the damming and diversion of water systems , which have been linked to unsafe concentrations of mercury and water-borne diseases . And many such projects are being constructed throughout the world . The number of large dams worldwide has climbed from just over five thousand in 1950 to forty thousand today , and the number of waterways altered for navigation has grown from fewer than nine thousand in 1900 to almost five hundred thousand . In the northern hemisphere , we have harnessed and tamed three-quarters of the flow from the world 's major rivers to power our cities . // At the same time , overexploitation of the planet 's major river systems is threatening another finite source of water . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Yellow River in China , and the Colorado River in America are among the major rivers that are so dammed , diverted , or overtapped that little or no fresh water reaches its final destination for significant stretches of time , " warns Sandra Postel of the Global Water Policy Project in Amherst , Massachusetts . // In fact , the Colorado is so oversubscribed on its journey through seven U.S. states that there is virtually nothing left to go out to sea . The flows of the Rio Grande and upper Colorado rivers are in danger of being reduced by as much as 75 percent and 40 percent , respectively , over the next century , and in 2001 , for the first time in recorded history , the Rio Grande ceased to flow into the Gulf of Mexico . // Water levels of the Great Lakes have also hit record lows in recent years . In 2001 , the water was more than a meter below its seasonal average in the Port of Montreal , and Lakes Michigan and Huron were down by 57 centimeters ( about 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are greatly affected by the water tables of the Great Lakes , and the environmental watchdog group Great Lakes United is warning that one day , the St. Lawrence may no longer reach the Atlantic Ocean . // * * * // Drying Planet // A powerful new study by hydrological engineer Michal Kravc ? k and his team of scientists at the Slovakian NGO People and Water shows in minute detail just how profoundly humanity 's activities are affecting its sources of fresh water . Kravc ? k , who has a distinguished career with the Slovak Academy of Sciences , has studied the effect of urbanization , industrial agriculture , deforestation , paving , infrastructure building , and dam construction on water systems in Slovakia and its surrounding countries . He has come up with an alarming finding . Destroying water 's natural habitat not only creates a supply crisis for people and animals , it also dramatically diminishes the actual amount of fresh water available on the planet . // Kravc ? k describes the hydrological cycle of a drop of water . It must first evaporate from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake , or the sea , then fall back down to earth as precipitation . If the drop of water falls back onto a forest , lake , blade of grass , meadow , or field , it can cooperate with Nature and return to the hydrological cycle because it can be easily absorbed into soil or forest . But if it falls onto pavement and buildings in urban areas , it is not absorbed into the soil and instead it heads out to sea . This means that less water exists in the ground and rivers and less evaporates from land . Therefore a landlocked country will receive less rain because the water that should have stayed there ( absorbed into the soil or rivers or lakes ) has fled out to the ocean . // ( Continues ... ) //
