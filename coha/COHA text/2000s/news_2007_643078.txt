<p> THE seven million or so inhabitants of Second Life , the three-dimensional online world , have spent millions of dollars on digital makeovers , clothing and other goods and services for their avatars . <p> But will the game 's players buy anything for themselves ? <p> Retailers and manufacturers like Reebok , Adidas , American Apparel and 1-800Flowers.com are setting up shop in Second Life , hoping that users will steer their avatars to these stores and buy goods to deliver to their real world addresses . So far , retailers say they have low expectations for their efforts , but some believe that the experiments could yield important lessons on how people might operate in the online realm . <p> " What we 're doing reminds me of the early days of the online world , " said Christopher G. McCann , president of 1-800-Flowers.com . " The first site we launched in 1995 was in 3-D , because I said people would n't want just two-dimensional photos . Here we are , 12 years later , back into this virtual world . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week , is in a brick greenhouse bearing the company logo . There , users may browse various plants and cut flowers , including a collection of " Happy Hour " bouquets arranged to resemble cocktails . Avatars may take a free floral arrangement , or users may also click from the game 's 1-800-Flowers.com store to the company 's Web site to buy one directly . <p> Mr. McCann said that he expected to distribute more virtual bouquets than real ones . " This is more about relationship building for us right now , and exposing our brand , " he said . <p> The opening of virtual stores in Second Life raises interesting questions as virtual worlds mesh elements of both e-commerce and bricks-and-mortar retailing . How , for instance , does a company market itself ? <p> As with many companies that opened stores in Second Life , 1-800-Flowers.com contracted an outside vendor . That developer , This Second Marketing , which is based in San Francisco , created avatars wearing 1-800-Flowers.com T-shirts . The team trolled popular areas of Second Life handing out virtual fliers about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in 60 hours , according to Joni West , president of This Second Marketing . In the first three days the greenhouse was open , it had more than 900 visitors , she said . <p> Joseph Laszlo an analyst with the online consulting firm Jupiter Research , said that building a store on Second Life will not come easily to many online merchants . " You actually have to think more like a bricks-and-mortar retailer than a virtual retailer , " he said . <p> Mr. Laszlo said retailers must still consider such things as store layout , shelf space and ways to help users find an item . <p> Location can also matter , but not as much as in the physical world . Rather than walk aimlessly through Second Life , people tend to navigate the realm by searching for specific services or landmarks in the search box and transporting themselves directly there . <p> One of the more successful commercial applications within Second Life has been Reebok 's virtual store , where users may create custom versions of Reebok shoes for their avatars , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the San Francisco office of Rivers Run Red , the agency that created Reebok 's Second Life store , the site distributed more than 27,000 pairs of digital shoes in its first 10 weeks . <p> Mr. James said he did not know how many of those people clicked through to Reebok 's Web site to buy physical reproductions of their avatars ' shoes , but he said the effort , which began in October , was indeed helping to sell the real items . " This allowed people to get comfortable with their product in the virtual world , " he said . <p> Other Second Life retailers said they had not seen results in their stores . <p> " I 'm not really sold on it yet , " said Raz Schionning , who oversaw American Apparel 's entry into Second Life last year . Mr. Schionning said the store , allows people to buy digital versions of the company 's clothes , and also click over to AmericanApparel.net to buy the real items . <p> Mr. Schionning said he could not comment on the level of sales that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he indicated that the numbers were quite small . <p> " The user interface is not particularly intuitive , " he said . " It took me a while to figure out how to buy something . " <p> One problem with selling on Second Life , Mr. Schionning said , is that it is so new that retailers have not come to a consensus on how to do it . As a result , buyers are not sure how to approach a transaction . " We 've all become accustomed to how an e-commerce site works , " he said , " but on Second Life , those conventions have n't really been established . " <p> " It 's not unlike the way it was on the Web initially , " Mr. Schionning added . " So there might actually be an advantage to waiting and watching to see what happens . " <p> Either way , the sudden popularity of three-dimensional virtual spaces online suggests that consumers are ready for that sort of experience even if retailers are not . Mr. Schionning , for one , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's a gap between the current online shopping experience and the next generation , " he said . " A virtual world can at least bring you closer to the store experience without actually bringing you there . I 'm not convinced Second Life is that answer , but it is a step along the path . " <p> In the meantime , Linden Lab , the privately held San Francisco developer of Second Life , is enjoying the increased attention from businesses . <p> The company does not earn a commission on sales made on the site , but it charges rent to developers who want to create customized spaces on the service . Companies can lease a 65,000-square-meter parcel for $200 a month . But to develop that land , businesses typically pay technology companies between $100,000 and $5 million , industry executives said . <p> According to Christopher Mahoney , Linden Lab 's business development manager , the company has in recent months experienced a spike in interest from software developers . Those developers , he predicted , will be able to deliver photo-realistic renderings of offline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Imagine taking an avatar and walking around a house , painting the walls dynamically and furnishing it with products from Pottery Barn or Ikea , " he said . " There 'll be a point when a 3-D Internet solves problems in your real world . " <p> #
