<p> The beleaguered people of the Democratic Republic of Congo are bracing themselves for more turmoil following the shooting of President Laurent Kabila . Mr. Kabila - the larger-than-life former Communist who trained with Che Guevara - was reportedly shot about noon Tuesday , while meeting with top generals in the presidential palace . But conflicting reports emerged later that indicated he may have survived the attack . The incident was being portrayed as simply a heat-of-the-moment assault , perhaps by one of Kabila 's own bodyguards . Yet it could easily have been part of a plan to overthrow him . " This is Congo , so all things are possible , " says George Bloch , a Nairobi-based analyst with the International Crisis Group . Whether coup attempt or brawl , it plunges an already chaotic country into a period of even more uncertainty . Congo is at the heart of Africa 's " first world war , " as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright calls it . The conflict has drawn in six other national armies , at least four rebel groups , and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the country 's rich diamond and gold mines . Two million people are displaced inside Congo , and civilians are suffering from widespread abuses . Neighboring countries are struggling to cope with outflows of refugees . The extremely complex war is being fought for a bewildering variety of reasons : Congolese rebels want to overthrow Kabila , several countries want to improve their security by clamping down on Congo-based rebel movements , while others want control of Congo 's natural resources . On one side , Angola , Namibia , and Zimbabwe are allied with Kabila . And on the other , Rwanda , Uganda , and Burundi are fighting alongside the rebel troops inside Congo . Two schools of thought are emerging about the implications for Congo if Kabila is dead . Some observers say it could help bring an end to the war by removing a stubborn obstacle to peace . Yet others argue that Kabila was simply a figurehead who would not have come to power were it not for the assistance of Rwanda and Uganda , and would not have stayed there without help from Angola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backer - would simply replace Kabila with someone even more willing to do their bidding , perpetuating the conflict and the misery of the country 's 50 million people . " The Angolans have been sending all sorts of signals they were impatient with Kabila and his behavior and were soliciting all sorts of advice over who could replace him , " says Mr. Bloch . " If this was at all planned , the Angolans would have played a part in it . It 's hard to conceive of a putsch happening in Kinshasa without the support of the Angolans . " Bloch says Kabila would frequently disagree with his foreign backers on military issues , but that the next president will be one who meets with the approval of Angola . " What we 're likely to see is a regime that is even less independent than he was , and that 's not in the interest of the Congolese people . " Hannelie de Beer , senior researcher at the Institute for Strategic Studies in South Africa , says there have been increasing signs that Kabila was losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be " a leader that agrees with the way the generals want to proceed . This conflict could just draw out and continue , " she says . The Congolese people have never been able to choose a leader freely . After a particularly brutal colonization by Belgium , the left-wing independence President Patrice Lumumba was overthrown with the support of Western powers . Coincidentally , yesterday marked 30 years since Lumumba was assassinated . That ushered in three decades of despotic rule by US-backed Mobutu Sese Seko , who changed the country 's name to Zaire . Mobutu took corruption to new heights with such antics as chartering Concorde jets to pick him up from a specially built runway deep in the interior , while his people struggled to make ends meet . Kabila was the nominal head of the Rwanda- and Uganda-backed rebel movement that overthrew Mobutu in May 1997 . But the real might lay in the hands of Rwanda and Uganda . Any euphoria over Mobutu 's departure was quickly erased by Kabila 's reign , despite his attempts to portray himself as the democratic savior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracked down on independent journalists , and put relatives and friends into key positions of power . Within a year , Kabila fell out with his former backers . He rejected Rwandan attempts to influence politics in Kinshasa , while Rwanda grew livid at his dalliance with fighters responsible for the 1994 Rwanda genocide , in which 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed . <p> The current war began in August 1998 with Rwanda , Uganda , and Burundi propping up new rebel movements in the east . Angola , Zimbabwe , and Namibia came to Kabila 's aid , and the president commenced railing against the invasion of his country by the very countries who brought him to power . Rebels occupied nearly half the country by the time a cease-fire and peace accord was signed in July 1999 . The war barely slowed . Meanwhile , Kabila threw up roadblocks to the arrival of United Nations military observers and tried to freeze out the internationally appointed mediator , Ketumile Masire of Botswana . Just last month , Kabila and his allies suffered their most significant defeat since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democracy rebels overran the town of Pweto in the country 's mineral-rich southeast . This resounding defeat - and the accompanying loss of military muscle - may have been the final straw for Kabila 's foreign backers , say observers . On Tuesday evening , presidential aide Eddy Kapend appeared on television appealing for calm and announcing that airports and borders had been closed , yet said nothing about the shooting . Senior officials from Belgium , the US , Britain , and France said yesterday the president died while being flown to Zimbabwe for medical treatment . His death was also confirmed by officials from Congo 's military allies , Angola and Zimbabwe , and by Kabila 's US-based spokesman , John Aycoth . Despite that , Congolese government spokesmen insisted that Kabila was still alive early yesterday afternoon , Kinshasa time , more than 24 hours after the shooting . They said he had been flown to a hospital in another country , and that his son , Army boss Gen. Joseph Kabila , would temporarily take the reins . The streets of the capital were mostly deserted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few curious people milling about . The government 's statements that Kabila was alive failed to quell speculation about the implications of his death . One scenario suggested that with Kabila gone , the nations involved in the Congo could agree to preserve the military status quo . That would leave Congo divided into spheres of influence . " It may not mean an end to the war , and it also means the informal partition of the country , " says Bloch . " The intervention of these external powers has done horrible things for the Congolese . " Others wondered if the rebel alliance would use the opportunity created by the power vacuum to launch a military push . Ugandan-backed Movement for the Liberation of Congo has all but surrounded the Congo River city of Mbandaka , just a four-day march upriver from the capital . If Kabila is dead , Ms. de Beer says peace could in fact be closer . " His attitude toward the international community was really an obstacle to peace , " she says , describing Kabila as " belligerent and rude . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more tactfully . It will depend on who becomes the next president , " de Beer adds . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2001 . The Christian Science Publishing Society
