To understand why Evo Morales has come within a llama 's hair of being President of Bolivia  --  and why his formidable political power is giving U.S. officials fits  --  pay attention when he and his top advisers open their mouths . That is , see what they 're chewing : coca leaves , treasured by Andean Indians like Morales as a sacred tonic and as their most lucrative cash crop but better known to Americans as the raw material of cocaine . Over the past five years , the U.S. has got Bolivia to uproot almost all of its coca shrubs  --  only to see Morales , 42 , and his left-wing Movement to Socialism engineer an astonishing protest this year that could force Bolivia 's next government to let the plants flourish again . " The coca leaf , " says Morales , whose party took the second largest bloc of seats in parliamentary elections in June , " is our new national flag . " <P> To the dismay of the Bush Administration , it 's a banner waving over a large swath of South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antidrug strategy . The widening revolt against it is the loudest sign yet of a new resentment toward the U.S. in Latin America , where free-market reforms pushed by Washington have left much of the region 's 500 million people poorer . A former parliamentary Deputy from Bolivia 's central coca-growing region , Morales in the past was often dismissed as a radical relic in the land where Che Guevara died . But today he 's strong enough to have made it into this week 's presidential runoff vote in the new parliament , facing front runner Gonzalo Sanchez , a former President . More than that , Evo-speak  --  " The drug war is just a U.S. excuse to control our countries "  --  resonates beyond Bolivia 's borders . Next door in Peru , irate coca farmers have successfully pressured the government to suspend eradication . In Colombia , the coca crop has grown fivefold in five years , to more than 400,000 acres , despite almost $1 billion in U.S. eradication funds . Authorities now say they will spray only " industrial-size " coca fields and not those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voters . If Morales can thwart the U.S. in Bolivia  --  South America 's poorest nation but Washington 's eradication showcase  --  it means the elimination effort has been a washout.
