Donald Mead 's debut in our pages is a remarkable effort , a blend of history and fantasy that takes us into Zulu territory during the days of British colonial expansion . A criminologist by education , Mr. Mead now works in the finance department of an auto manufacturer ( thus proving , he says , that his grandmother was right about crime not paying ) . He lives , works and writes in Bloomington , Illinois . His previous credits include a couple of stories in a small online magazine and his interview of Joe Haldeman was published in Strange Horizons . He is working on more short stories and is marketing a series of novels tentatively entitled Feral Wizards . <p> " LET 'S MAKE LOVE , CETSHWAYO . " Ngqumbazi untied a knot and her beaded cape drifted off her shoulders . She folded the cape before placing it in the corner of the hut with her headpiece . Last of all , she removed her hip belt and skirt , all masterpieces of beaded decoration . Cetshwayo 's eyes followed her as she moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush , helping her with the knots . But his own royal symbols were weighing heavily , and he could do no more than lift his head from the grass mat to watch . Ngqumbazi flitted around a post and made for the candles . Cetshwayo raised his hand . " No . Leave them burning . Sihayo and the Great Ones might be back tonight . I want them to see the light and come by the hut . " She smiled , knelt and scooted on her knees to his side . " But I do n't want anyone to come knocking tonight . " She stretched out on her belly and draped an arm over his chest . " I 've told the other wives to stay in their huts . It 's just you and me , serenaded by the lowing of the cattle . " Cetshwayo felt a smile flicker on his face . Ngqumbazi 's skin was as smooth as otter fur . He traced his fingers up her arm to the copper rings just above her elbow . " You forgot to take your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't forget . And I left my anklets on too . " She curled a leg upward so Cetshwayo could see the adornment . The poor light from the candles was not enough to make out the colors , but he knew they could only be green and black beads woven in squares - the same pattern as her cape and headpiece . It was the royal pattern established in Shaka 's day when he placed Zulus above all of the Nguni tribes . Ngqumbazi let her leg drop . " I like the sound they make when we indulge our passion . Like wind through ripe millet . " Cetshwayo touched her face . " You are so beautiful . " She grabbed his fingers and kissed them . " Beautiful enough to blow out the candles ? " Cetshwayo shook his head . " I ca n't ... the Great Ones . " Ngqumbazi lost her smile . " They can wait . You 're king . There are plenty of huts in Ulundi they can sleep in until morning . " What could he say ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left with the fighting and dying . Not women . She laid her head on his chest Cetshwayo pretended not to notice her leg curl up by his side and her hand creep down to one of her anklets . It was a surreptitious , wellpracticed movement . Cetshwayo guessed she had been using the magic for years before he had figured it out . He could have destroyed the anklet long ago , but the effects of the spell were always pleasant . " I am the leopardess , " she cooed . Ngqumbazi always made the strange declaration before love-making . He used to think it was meant to stir his passion - no doubt what she wanted him to think - but it was just part of the spell casting . Indeed , there was an immediate stirring , but tonight was not the night for coupling . He touched a beaded string on his loin covering and mouthed silent words , " I am the tortoise . " The stirring subsided . It was only a matter of time before Ngqumbazi discovered that he had found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling sick ? " Cetshwayo rubbed his eyes and yawned . " I 've felt better . " She pulled his hands away from his eyes . " You look exhausted . Are n't you sleeping well ? " " No . Nightmares . " " Tell me . " He sighed . " The same every night . I 'm standing on the ocean 's shore in Ombane province and the water turns to blood . " Ngqumbazi shivered and pulled a wool blanket over the both of them . " It could be our enemy 's blood . " He helped her with the blanket until they were both snug underneath . " It could be Zulu blood . " " Zulus are used to dying , " Ngqumbazi said . " That 's what my father used to say . " " I have n't ordered war since I became king . " " But before you were king .... " Cetshwayo shut his eyes , but there was no stopping the memories . No one could be as brutal as his uncle , Shaka . His father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still a prince , Cetshwayo and his faction .... He turned on his side toward Ngqumbazi , keeping his eyes closed . Ngqumbazi tugged at his loin covering , but he stopped her . " Before I became king , my men and I slaughtered my brother 's faction - twenty thousand dead . A battlefield of slit bellies . " " But if you had n't .... " Ngqumbazi seemed to realize his burden , the weight of his memories . " If you had n't , your brother would 've killed you . It 's only a shame that Mbulazi got away . " " It does n't matter , " said Cetshwayo . " He has no more followers , no more cattle . " " I 'm sure he 's behind this trouble with the British . " Cetshwayo shook his head . " Not him . It 's something to do with Sihayo . He sent his brother into Natal to kidnap two of his runaway wives . Then he executed them both for cheating on him . " He felt Ngqumbazi shiver again even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flash and crack of thunder caused Cetshwayo to kick off the blanket . Ngqumbazi threw her arms around his neck and pinned him back on the mat . " Where do you think you 're going ? " Cetshwayo stared at her , not sure if she was joking . " The cattle - " " Dinuzulu is attending the cattle tonight . I 've seen to that too . " " But he 's only eleven . " " He 's a Zulu prince with a hundred men at his command ; I think he 'll manage . " Ngqumbazi retrieved the blanket as Cetshwayo settled back onto the mat . There was no fighting it . He groaned as rain began to pound the roof . " Curse the weather . Either too little water or too much . The drought should 've ended us all last year . " Ngqumbazi snuggled back on his chest . " And the rain this year wo n't stop . " Cetshwayo snorted . " At least the crops look better this year - if they 're not drowned . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our sins . He baptized me last month . " He turned his head to look at her . " Learning the white man 's religion from the fat parson ? " " What 's wrong with that ? " " Well , nothing I suppose . " Cetshwayo turned his eyes back toward the roof and grinned . " If you like being preached to by a sinner . " " What 's that supposed to mean ? What makes you think he 's a sinner ? " " John Dunn told me . He said Christians can only have one wife . The fat parson has fifty Zulu wives . " Cetshwayo laughed . " And I ca n't even count his children ! " Ngqumbazi glared . " And how many Zulu wives does John Dunn have ? " " I do n't know or care . He 's my kind of sinner . " Cetshwayo 's humor faded . " He 's the only white man who understands Zulus , our history , our ways . Do you think the fat parson really cares about us ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared a week ago . Left all his wives and children . " Cetshwayo closed his eyes . " He knows something about the British . He 's running for cover . " More lightning and thunder . " I do n't want to fight the British , " he said . " It 'll be much worse than fighting the Boers . " Ngqumbazi raised her head . " Hush ! You do n't want the warriors to think you have weak feet . " Cetshwayo gave an empty laugh . " My own brother tried to assassinate me , and my half-brothers are plotting against me . I lost two food testers last year . No one can call me a coward . " " Why do n't you move against Zibhebhu and Hamu - wipe them out ? " " No cause . Not yet , at least . The Great Ones wo n't support me . " Cetshwayo opened his eyes and looked at her . " The British issue comes first . Even my half-brothers know that . There 'll be plenty of time for feuds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what do you have time for now ? " She touched her anklet again . " I am the leopardess . " Cetshwayo declined the counterspell and smiled . " Blow out the candles . " CETSHWAYO CRADLED his face in his hands . " What does it mean ? " The chiefs and Great Ones crowded in his hut gave no answer . Rain battered the roof . He looked up and leaned back against a mud wall . Sihayo shrugged . His ostrich-feather headdress drooped around his eyes , waterlogged by his long march in the rain . " The British think they own everything . What they have is never enough . They always want more . They 're as bad as the Boers . " Old Tshingwayo shook his head . He had discarded his headdress and all of his furs in favor of a dry blanket , which he had fully wrapped himself in . Sitting , he looked like a tree stump with a weathered , gray-haired head on top . His only adornment was the head-ring of a married man . " I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle . The British ? I do n't know what they hope to gain by bullying the Zulu . " Hamu yawned and scratched his bulging belly . " I 'm hungry . " " Meat and millet beer are on the way . Be patient . " Cetshwayo realized his half-brother had arrived without his food tester . He could poison the fat schemer now and be done with him , but he might need Hamu 's warriors if there was a war with the British . His other halfbrother , Zibhebhu , was in his province with his warriors awaiting orders - at least he was supposed to be . Cetshwayo turned back to Tshingwayo . " Tell it again . " The twenty or so chiefs who were visiting during this time of crisis sat along the far wall , Cetshwayo 's hut being the only one large enough to accommodate so many . Although not Great Ones , they leaned closer to listen . Tshingwayo 's arm snaked out of his blanket to scratch his head . " We met at the Christian mission across the Tugela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to translate . And the British - some were red soldiers . Others wore ... " Tshingwayo paused to form his tongue around foreign words , " ... trousers and coats . Much finer than what the Boers wear . We sat and listened . " The old man stopped as trays were brought in , each bearing its weight in spiced goat meat , sliced melon , and bowls of steaming hot beer . Sihayo took up the story as they began grabbing food . " At first , it was good news - the Commission ruled in our favor in the border fight with the Boers . " Hamu laughed between gulps of beer . " One thing the British are good for - they can keep the Boers out of Zululand . " " But then came their demands . " Sihayo stopped his perusal of the food and looked at Cetshwayo . " Demands from the great white queen . " All stopped eating and stared at Cetshwayo . He set down his bowl of beer . " And their queen dictates to the Zulu king ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Tshingwayo . " And they want cattle ? " Sihayo sneered . " A fine for my brother sneaking into Natal for my two wives . They also want my brother . Ha ! " " You do n't have to turn over your brother to the British , " said Cetshwayo . " He did n't do anything wrong . " Sihayo turned back to the food tray and mumbled . " Stupid British ! " " And they demand that chiefs carry out no more executions without a trial and an appeal to you , " said Tshingwayo . Cetshwayo could see several chiefs look up from the feast . He shook his head . " How can I tell a chief what to do in his own province - within his own clan ? The British think I 'm like Shaka - total rule . Things have changed so much since then . " Tshingwayo nodded . Cetshwayo knew his friend could attest directly to that fact . The old warrior , now Great One , had survived the terror of Shaka fifty years ago and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say you can no longer call together the impi , " said Sihayo . Hamu looked up from a piece of roasted goat . " They would want that , would n't they ? Forty thousand armed Zulus ! They 'd drop their rifles and swim home to their great white queen . " They all laughed . Cetshwayo fell silent . He could not appear weak in front of the Great Ones and chiefs , but war with the British was a deadly way to prove one 's bravery . " To give in is to stop being Zulu , " he said . " To fight is to risk great loss , " said Tshingwayo . " Look what the British did to the Gaika , the Gealeka , and the hottentots . Crushed . They even shoot Bushmen just for sport ! " Hamu dropped his beer bowl with a clatter and turned to Cetshwayo . " They were n't Zulu ! The British have n't been in a real fight yet . Let them feel the thrust of the iKlawa and then they 'll leave us alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sihayo said . " Send them the cattle and see if that will suit them . " " Maybe , " Tshingwayo said . " Cattle are valuable . It might be enough for them to forget the rest of their demands . " Cetshwayo nodded . " And if we 're wrong ? " Hamu leaned back , bracing his bulk on his arms . " If we 're wrong we have forty thousand Zulus who will sweep them from the field . " Cetshwayo shook his head . Hamu lacked the experience to see the deadly implications of his words . Shouting near the hut 's entrance caused several of the chiefs to reach for spears . A woman , tall and powerful , leveraged herself into the hut . She was dragging along an Ulundi warrior who had both hands latched onto her arm and was straining to pull her in the opposite direction . The warrior , his white oxtail necklace half torn off , glanced wide-eyed at the assemblage . " Forgive me , " he said between labored breaths . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll have her out of here in no time . " Cetshwayo snickered . Despite the warrior 's words , the woman was having her way with him . She stood a full head taller , bracing her tree-like frame on legs of sinew and muscle . The copper coils around her arms rang as she yanked the young warrior along . The blue and green bead pattern on her throat collar and hip belt suggested she came from far away , perhaps as far as Msinga . She was fully a woman , with wide hips and breasts as sharp as iKlawa . Cetshwayo guessed her to be nearly thirty years old , although she still wore the small apron of a single girl . " Cetshwayo . " Tshingwayo nudged him and pointed at the woman 's headpiece . It was long like flowing hair and drifted down her back and around her shoulders - no doubt ox hair dyed black . It was decorated with hundreds of white beads , making it look like the midnight sky full of stars . Tshingwayo leaned close and whispered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as coincidence where diviners were concerned . " Let her go , " Cetshwayo said . The warrior released his weak grip on her arm . She drew back her hand as if to strike him , sending him whimpering out the hut 's door . Sihayo picked up his iKlawa and pointed it at her . " What 's your business ? You 've got a lot of nerve to interrupt the king and the Great Ones ! " Cetshwayo gathered a more telling view of her as she approached and bent down to her knees . Indeed she was from Msinga , the Umzansi clan , with ostrich egg-sized disks stretching her earlobes wide and beaded ropes for bracelets . A petite pug nose and almond-shaped eyes were also unusual for Zulus . She was beautiful . She stretched to a belly-crawl , perhaps aware that her life was not her own in this place . " Forgive my rudeness , but it is urgent . I must talk to King Cetshwayo alone . " Cetshwayo resisted the urge to dismiss the Great Ones and chiefs . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears of all Zulus . What 's your name ? " The woman raised her head and studied him for a moment . " Nokukhanya of the Umzansi . " " You fought well just to have a discussion with me . It must be important . " " The highest importance . The survival of the Zulus . " Hamu gave the diviner a glare and turned to Cetshwayo . " She 's nothing more than a witch . You should send her off ! " Cetshwayo regarded the girl . Hamu was right . An ill-omen from a diviner could easily cause fear among the chiefs , especially those who put stock in mysticism . A prediction of great loss might make them hesitant to fight . A vision of victory might make them too eager . Whatever came from this woman 's mouth meant losing influence over the Great Ones and chiefs . " Out with her ! " Cetshwayo bellowed . Hamu leapt to his feet . He had considerably more experience with women than the little warrior the diviner had dragged about . Grabbing her arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carried her toward the entrance . She shrieked and fought to look back . " Wait ! I beg you for only a moment of your time ! I know about your dream of the bloody ocean ! " " Stop ! " The dream . Every night Cetshwayo had the same dream . It gnawed at him like a hyena . He had to know . Hamu had stopped to look back but still held the girl . Cetshwayo let out a breath . " Release her . " Clearly disappointed , Hamu dropped her and returned to his tray of goat meat . The diviner crawled toward the group again , apprehension in her eyes . " You are wise to listen to me . War is ahead and Zulus need the blessing of the ancestors . " " What is your name again ? " Cetshwayo asked . " Nokukhanya , my king . " " And what do you know of my dreams ? " Nokukhanya gave a deep smile that caused a chill in Cetshwayo 's spine . " An ocean of blood , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes flashed . " Zulus are n't afraid to die . " Nokukhanya looked at the fat man , but her smile never wavered . " Your blood is in that ocean too , Hamu . As is that of your wives , sons , and daughters . " Hamu sneered . " Witch lies ! " She turned back to Cetshwayo . " All Zulus . " Hamu 's anger seemed overflowing . " So you 're saying we should bow down to the British ? To a white queen instead of a Zulu king ? Abandon our traditions ? " Nokukhanya shook her head . " No . We must fight or something worse will happen - our ancestors will desert us . " Tshing wayo lowered his eyes . " So we 're doomed no matter our path . Die in body one way , the in spirit the other . " Again , Nokukhanya shook her head . " There is a third way . A spirit in the shape of a lizard came to me one night and told me of a Zulu who might help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll order him to help ! " Nokukhanya 's grin broadened . " He is from the Cube clan . " " This story gets worse in the telling , " said Hamu . " Shaka was never able to defeat the Cube . Cetshwayo has no authority over them . " The woman shrugged . " He 's a diviner . He 'll help ... if the price is right . " Hamu scooted so he could lean back against the wall and folded his arms across his belly . " I knew we 'd get to a price at some point . " Sihayo looked at Hamu . " So what if there 's a price ? If negotiations fail , it 'll be war . If magic will help us avoid slaughter , then we should use it . " Hamu gritted his teeth . " It 's sorcery ! The war doctors will be furious ! " Cetshwayo turned to Tshingwayo . " What do you think , old friend ? You must have looked into the face of death a thousand times in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set down his beer . " I have weak feet when it comes to magic , and I have no doubt that this man she speaks of is a sorcerer , not a diviner . " He sighed and pulled his blanket around himself . " But once Shaka ignored a sorcerer who told him to watch for cows with knives , and within a week , Shaka 's brothers assassinated him while he was attending the cattle in the Ulundi corral . I advise that we negotiate with both the British and this sorcerer . " His eyes narrowed . " And you should call up the impi . " Cetshwayo glanced around at the other Great Ones . Sihayo nodded . Hamu looked away , but finally nodded too . Several of the chiefs in the back of the room were also nodding , but their agreement was hardly needed . " So be it . " Cetshwayo looked down upon the woman . " And the name of this diviner and his village ? " Still on her belly , she stayed silent . Cetshwayo fought back a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave him a twisted smile . " I will become your new Right Hand queen , Cetshwayo , and our son will inherit the Zulu throne . " THE IKLAWA BURSTING from the entrance of Cetshwayo 's hut was meant for his heart , but it was an unpracticed thrust . He grabbed the wielder 's arms and pulled . Ngqumbazi came spilling out with a cry , tumbling on the worn grass and losing grip of the weapon . She came to a rolling stop on her back . Her spectacular fall caused a roar of laughter . The break in the rain had beckoned the whole village of Ulundi to venture out for work and play . Scores had witnessed the blundering attack , and the laughter was attracting even more to watch . Three warriors , decidedly lacking in humor , came running from the corral , but Cetshwayo waved them off . Ngqumbazi sat up and looked at the surrounding villagers , her mouth gaping . Her searching eyes landed on Cetshwayo , and a scowl took hold . The iKlawa was back in her hands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest . Cetshwayo latched onto the wooden shaft of the iKlawa as he pivoted out of the way . This time , he kept the weapon as she went crashing to the ground . Howls of laughter filled the village . Cetshwayo smiled and approached , stopping well out of lunging distance . " You should stab to the belly , not the chest . The belly is harder to defend . " She looked up , grass and mud clinging to her sweaty body . Her face was chiseled hate . " I 'll kill you . Sooner or later , I 'll kill you ! " He leaned on the iKlawa . " And disappoint the British ? They 'll cut off the bead trade , and then what will you do ? " Fat tears leaked from her eyes . " I do n't care what happens to me or to you ! I wo n't see that woman as your new wife . I wo n't have another prince competing with Dinuzulu . He 's the rightful heir . " Cetshwayo tired of the chattering crowd and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dinuzulu is the rightful heir , indeed . He is the oldest and most capable by far . " " But that woman-that witch ! She wants to he by your side in my place as the Right Hand queen . She wants to be the mother of the next king . " Cetshwayo 's smile waned . " Who told you that rubbish ? " " Ha ! The truth nips at your heels . " Ngqumbazi tried to sound triumphant , but there was only pain in her eyes . " Men talk to their wives . Wives talk to each other . Everyone in Ulundi knows the sordid details . " " Then you should know it 's unlikely I 'll marry her . If negotiations go well with the British , there will be no need to pursue our agreement . " Ngqumbazi 's breathing had returned to normal . She stood , inspecting her bruises as she straightened . " And if negotiations fail , you will marry her just for a stray bit of information . " Cetshwayo shrugged . Part of him wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful and had a magnificent untouched body . But that was a dangerous wish . Failed negotiations meant a battlefield of dead Zulus - his nightmare of an ocean of blood . " Do n't worry . Even if I do marry her and she bears a male child , Dinuzulu will be king long before her child develops a desire to rule . " Ngqumbazi adjusted her beaded cape and apron . " And how did your father become king ? " Cetshwayo bit his cheek . She looked at him . Her tears had dried , leaving shiny streaks , and cold resignation had chased the pain from her eyes . " Should I remind you ? " " My father , Mpande , killed his half-brother , Dingane , to become king , " he said evenly . " And how did Dingane become king ? " Cetshwayo tightened his grip on the iKlawa . " Dingane and Mpande killed their half-brother , Shaka . " She did n't have to ask the next question . Cetshwayo had become king by succession after Mpande died seven years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill his own brother , Mbulazi . The hyenas still picked at the bones of Mbulazi 's followers . " And your own half-brothers plot against you even now , " she said . " They would n't ! Not now with the British on our border ! " She smiled . " Would n't they ? You may have exiled Mbulazi , but both Hamu and Zibhebhu covet your throne . Either of them might change sides and join the British . It 's not impossible . John Dunn was once your friend , but he took his Zulu retainers across the river into Natal . Now there will be Zulus fighting along with the British . " Cetshwayo picked up the iKlawa and laid it across his shoulders . He had an urge to check the cattle . It soothed him , and they seemed to like it when he recited poetry and painted their faces . He turned and took the path toward the corral . " At least get rid of the witch ! " Ngqumbazi called after him . He looked over his shoulder . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ! " Ngqumbazi 's voice had become hoarse . " She 's tricking you into this war . She 'll bring death to us all ! " Rain fell as if someone had cut the belly of the clouds with a great iKlawa . Nokukhanya , draped in a blanket , sat next to a village hut that looked over the Ulundi pasture . The hut 's sloping roof extended far enough to keep her dry , but it would not last . She would have to get soaked at some point , but by then , greater concerns would occupy her mind . She would once again put her life into the fickle hands of the Zulu king . The rain could not wash away the stench of ten thousand warriors the impi . Nokukhanya could scarcely imagine how the pasture held them all , and from her high vantage point , she could see hundreds more snaking through the countryside toward the gathering . The men of the impi had given up on fire , lacking the convenience of shelter , and were trying to escape the rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stretched cow hide over a wood frame seemed to work reasonably well as a personal roof . In battle , isiHlangu were even known to serve their actual purpose as shielding against thrown spears . Nokukhanya knew they would be useless against British bullets . The warriors of the impi had separated themselves into regiments , each several thousand strong . The distance between the regiments was roughly equal to two set fence posts . Zulus of different provinces stared at each other from across this divide , most with looks of suspicion , some with malevolence . There would be no fighting - not yet . But when the dancing started , along with the singing and boasting , Zulus would spill Zulu blood , and even Cetshwayo would not be able to stop it . The warriors were not always to blame . In past conflicts , Nokukhanya had seen war doctors use magic to stir their hearts , maddening them to the point of lustful massacre . That was why most tribes feared the Zulu . That was why other tribes no longer existed . Somewhere in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ province . Earlier , she had spotted the ear coverings made from green monkey hide that distinguished them . She even thought she had seen some of the young men from the Umzansi corral , her Zulu clan . Their isiHlangu were dyed black with only a few white marks - young and inexperienced . She had seen them tremble , their regiment next to the umCityo regiment with their solid white isiHlangu with rows of black marks - gray-headed with scars . Those Zulus remembered the old days Nokukhanya had heard of only in stories - human gore waist deep , the day the Blood River got its name , the days of Shaka . Movement between the regiments caught her eye . Three Ulundi warriors were escorting a man up the hill toward her . She stood and stepped into the rain , keeping the blanket around her shoulders . The man , perhaps in his forties judging by the slight droop under his eyes and uneven saunter caused by his knotted knees , had a strange face for a Zulu . His eyebrows were thick , his nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silt . Nokukhanya wondered if all those of the Cube clan looked like this or if he was an anomaly even among them . The only feature she recognized was the long , beaded hair of a diviner . She interposed herself in their path , causing them to stop . The leading warrior clenched his jaw . Nokukhanya had snuck past him a month earlier to see the king . The frightened little warrior in the rear was the one she had dragged into the hut . " You know where we 're going , " said the lead warrior . " Get out of the way . " Nokukhanya smiled . " I 'm just going to join you . " She fell in beside the man as they started off toward the king 's reviewing stand . The diviner glanced at her . " Who are you ? " " Nokukhanya . " She enjoyed the chance to build mystery with short answers . Brevity also created the illusion that she had more influence over the situation than she actually had . In truth , her entire future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name ? " " Umpisana . " He studied her more closely , this time staring at her ear disks . " Do those hurt ? " She shrugged . " Did your circumcision hurt ? " He grimaced and looked forward . " I suppose you 're behind my being here . " " No . Our departed ancestors are behind it . An animal spirit told me to seek you out . " " To do what ? " " Save the Zulu people . " Umpisana chuckled . " Feeling the blade of the British at your back ? Not all Zulus feel the threat . The Cube have n't made enemies of the British . Neither have the Qulsi . Why should we care if the white foreigners put you and your king into their corral ? " Nokukhanya suppressed a glare . " Do you really think the British will leave you alone after they finish with us ? Do n't be a fool ! " His chuckle died in his throat . " What do you think I can do against the British ? There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The spirit did n't say . He just named you and your village . I used my influence with the king and had him send an emissary to bargain with you .

What were you doing there ? " His chuckle returned . " Nervous ? Think I 'm working for the British ? " " You 'd better hope I do n't . You 're about to appear before the Zulu king . " Again , his humor failed him and his eyes widened . " I often go to Natal to make purchases . Cetshwayo has complete control of the glass bead trade , so the Cube are forced to travel to Natal . " Nokukhanya pulled the blanket more tightly around her neck and looked away . He was lying . A man of his standing - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , time-consuming task . He would probably send one of his wives who had a sense for colors and patterns . She wondered if that old Great One , Tshingwayo , had been right in calling him a sorcerer . The rumor was that sorcerers gained their power by sacrificing children . A Zulu child would be unthinkable , but if he knew he was being summoned by the Zulu king , a brief trip to Natal to kidnap a child from another tribe might not be out of the question . She studied him from the corner of her eye . He was carrying nothing more than a pouch for powders and herbs . " Where are your things ? " " Well outside of Ulundi , " he said curtly . " Hidden where no one will find them . No need to carry provisions around all day or however long I 'm here . " She glanced over her shoulder at the hills of scrub and trees . Was there a child in the wilderness just outside of Ulundi ? What if the hyenas found the child before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child and Umpisana returned for his sacrifice ? She had come too far now to get weak feet . If it appeared that she had misled the king and the Great Ones and brought Umpisana here by mistake , she might be the first casualty of the war . CETSHWAYO SAT on the reviewing stand alongside the Great Ones , three war doctors and twenty chiefs from scattered Zulu clans . Pitiless rain created puddles on the worn earth of the village corral , but the stand 's thatch roof kept them dry with the exception of a leak right over Hamu 's head . They had worked out their strategy for war with the British in quick fashion-before second meal . However , negotiations for the dancing and singing that was the prelude to war were dragging on well into the latter half of the day . The dour and angry faces surrounding him suggested that negotiations were far from over . " The umCityo regiment must be nearest the reviewing stand ! " shouted one . " We are the oldest ! " Cetshwayo regarded the speaker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His warriors made up nearly a quarter of the umCityo , although Cetshwayo was not sure which specific clan Dabulamanzi belonged to . It was hard to tell province and clan without their full battle regalia . Today , all of the chiefs chose a simple married man 's head ring and a warm blanket . All had backed down from Dabulamanzi 's claim except for one . " Ngobamakosi is the oldest regiment . " Cetshwayo recognized the deep , rumbling voice of Mavumengwana . Indeed , he was older , broad of shoulder and well-scarred . Had he any hair left , it would have been gray , though not as gray as Cetshwayo 's old friend , Tshingwayo . Mavumengwana might have been old enough to remember Shaka , but he would have been a child at the time . " You just say that because you 're Shaka 's old regiment , " said Dabulamanzi . " But you 've had too many replacements . Your isiHlangu are black and clean , but ours are white and marked . " Cetshwayo jumped to his feet with outstretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someone 's coming , " said one of the war doctors . The struggling stopped as all eyes turned toward the small procession that approached . " We 'll decide this later , " said Cetshwayo . " Here comes the diviner I told you about . Sit . " There were plenty of glares , but everyone sat down on the wooden floor of the reviewing stand . Ignoring the rain came three warriors surrounding the woman diviner , Nokukhanya , and a stranger wearing a diviner 's long headpiece . They stopped before the stand and the warriors dropped to one knee while Nokukhanya prostrated herself on her stomach . The stranger stood . Cetshwayo leaned forward and smiled . " You 're from the Cube , are n't you ? " The man nodded . " My name is Umpisana . " " All of you rise , " said Cetshwayo . " Even you , Nokukhanya . No Zulu should bow while a Cube stands . " The guards stood . Nokukhanya rose only to her knees and maneuvered closer to the reviewing stand . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the one who - " " Shut up , woman ! " Cetshwayo shouted . " He may be many things , but I 'll decide what use he is to me . And if he fails to live up to your prophecy and I end up fifty head of cattle poorer , I 'll stake you out for the lions myself ! " Nokukhanya , shaking , flung herself on her stomach . " Forgive me , Cetshwayo . I 'll say nothing more . " Cetshwayo gave her one last glare . When they first had met , he had indulged her rude behavior . Now that the impi was assembled , the chiefs were expecting to see a powerful king , someone who deserved to have their loyalty , someone uncompromising like Shaka . He turned to Umpisana . " You know war is on the way ? " " More than you know . " Cetshwayo was finding discussions with diviners to be unpleasant at best . " What do you mean by that ? " " I 've just been in Natal a week ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men on the border . There are oxen and wagons , cavalry , even some Zulus and other tribes all preparing to pour over the border . " Umpisana 's words set off a wave of muttering from the chiefs . They were ready for war , willing to spill Zulu blood to win recognition for themselves and their clans . Cetshwayo wondered if they would think differently if they knew they were facing annihilation . " You saw this ? " Umpisana nodded . " They 're probably crossing the Tugela River as we speak . " Sihayo leaned in and whispered . " At least we know where we stand . Your offer to pay the fine of cattle was not enough , but they wo n't catch us napping . The British move slowly , even with horses . They have to stay close to their oxen and supplies . If they 're crossing , we 'll hear it from runners before they make their first camp . " Cetshwayo rubbed his chin and regarded Umpisana . " What were you doing in Natal ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass beads , " he said . " Diviners have great need of beads . " Cetshwayo looked at Nokukhanya for confirmation . She nodded , although her eyes reflected dread . He bit back the urge to yell at her again . Instead , he looked at Umpisana and gestured to Nokukhanya . " This diviner had some sort of vision that you might be able to aid us in our war with the British . " Cetshwayo waited for a reaction from the diviner . Seeing none , he continued . " While we need no such magic to defeat the British , it could insult our spirit ancestors if I ignore the vision . If you have magic to defeat the British , I 'm willing to pay you for it . Certainly with more cattle . I can also offer glass beads in abundance and your choice of girls from the corral - " Umpisana raised his hand . " The Zulu king is very generous , and I would accept if I could , but I have no magic to defeat the British . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sputtered a laugh . Nokukhanya leapt to her feet and stared at Umpisana . She turned to Cetshwayo with pleading eyes . " The animal spirit would n't lie ! He has the power we need ! " Cetshwayo forced a smile to hide his rising panic . He needed just one advantage or strategy or even a trick that would be useful in this war . He needed a way to stop the ocean of blood . " You can think of no magic to help us ? A prayer ? A charm against bullets ? A potion of strength ? " Umpisana shook his head . " Nothing . May I go now ? " Zulus had a tradition of finding creative and painful methods to put people to death . Cetshwayo guessed those methods were somehow reflected in his expression judging by the horror on Nokukhanya 's face . She turned to Umpisana . " Is there nothing you can do ? You must have one spell or one skill that no one else has . " Umpisana bit his lower lip in exaggerated thought . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful in a war . " " What is it ? " Nokukhanya asked . " I can summon Intulo . " At first , Cetshwayo thought Umpisana was joking , but his eyes were steady and his face cold as a snake 's heart . None of the chiefs dared make a sound , not even Hamu . But the war doctors whispered to each other in harsh tones . One of them spoke up . " Summoning the lizard god is not a spell . That 's sorcery ! An abomination ! " " Quiet ! " Cetshwayo did not have to appease the war doctors like he did the chiefs . They had no power . They would tolerate anything if he paid them in cattle . Sihayo addressed Umpisana , a slight quiver in his voice . " And what will Intulo do for you ? " " I do n't have the power to hold him for very long , " Umpisana said . " He usually has the taste for meat - human flesh - so I 'm reluctant to use the spell at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill at your command ? " " Oh yes . " There was a glimmer in the diviner 's eyes . " He wants nothing more than to feast on men . I suspect it 's a desire residing in him from his days in this world - before he was elevated to the heavens by uKqil . " Sihayo spoke again . " Could he kill an entire army ? The British ? " Umpisana shook his head . " No . I once tested his hunger on a Swazi girl we had captured in a raid . As soon as he bit into her head , severing it , the spell was broken and he disappeared . " " Curse ! " Cetshwayo liked the idea of sending a god-like creature into the midst of the British and tearing them to shreds . They 'd never return to Zululand . But it was not really his power to do so . It was Umpisana 's - a Cube . He could certainly imagine the diviner sending Intulo after him and the Zulu impi . " Maybe there 's still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cetshwayo . " If Intulo could kill but one .... " Cetshwayo nodded and spoke to Umpisana . " Could Intulo be ordered to kill a specific man ? The general of the British soldiers ? " Umpisana was silent for a moment , tugging at his potion pouch . " Yes , I think so . He is like uKqil - all-knowing . If I told him to eat the leader of the British soldiers , and those soldiers were nearby for me to point at , I think he could do it . But as soon as he killed the man , he would vanish . " Sihayo snapped his fingers . " That might work . Imagine a creature such as Intulo appearing among them and gobbling down their general . They 'd run for home ! " Cetshwayo rested his head on his fists and considered the diviner . It might work . And he 'd pay Umpisana well if it did . Not that he would ever see the cattle . He could never let a Cube , an enemy , live with that kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her stomach again , no doubt joyous that her life would be spared . He would enjoy fulfilling their arrangement . She looked up and he nearly gasped . The look of terror was still in her eyes . Why ? " Cetshwayo . " He turned to Hamu . " If we scare away the British , how will our warriors earn honor in battle ? " " We still have Swazi and Boers to fight , " Cetshwayo said . " But - " " Quiet ! There will be plenty of opportunity to wash your iKlawa in blood . It is the Zulu path . The spirits put this man before me and I will use him . I can afford to anger queens and generals and politicians .. . but not the spirits ! " The ocean of blood was at his feet again . He had to stop it . He regarded the diviner . " What price ? " Umpisana answered quickly . " Two hundred and fifty head of cattle and ten virgins . " " Done ! " Cetshwayo stood . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to myself , " Umpisana continued . " And warriors to guard it . My art is secret , and no one must enter . Even if screams are heard from within , no one can ever enter . " Cetshwayo nodded . " Wait , " one of the war doctors spoke up again . " It 's easy to brag about spells and walk away with cattle . Let 's see proof of your power . " Umpisana looked at the war doctor and spoke through a clenched jaw . " Calling forth Intulo is hardly something I can do on a whim - " " I knew it ! " said another of the war doctors . " You 're a fraud ! You 'll take the king 's cattle and disappear ! " Umpisana 's eyes widened . " Proof ? You demand proof ? " " Perhaps another time - " Cetshwayo began . " I 'll show you proof ! " Umpisana bellowed . He pulled a bound and squirming rat from his potion pouch along with a knife . With a quick movement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the eyes of one of the warriors guarding him . The warrior dropped his iKlawa and isiHlangu and screamed , putting his hands to his face . The two other warriors looked at Cetshwayo , but he gave no orders , unable to speak . Umpisana shouted to the rain-filled heavens . " Spirit of Shaka , hear me ! " He approached the still blind warrior and cut two crossing slashes on his chest - not deep enough to kill , but more than adequate to cause blood to drench the front of his body . Umpisana looked up again . " Speak to us , Shaka ! I give you the body of this noble Zulu to receive your spirit ! " " Sorcery , Cetshwayo ! " said one of the war doctors . " Stop him ! " But he could not stop him . He was fascinated . Could Umpisana really call the spirit of Shaka ? It could be a good omen-the spirit of Shaka blessing the Zulu before the battle . And in front of all of the chiefs to hear it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tshingwayo . He had never seen fear on the old man 's face before , but he saw it now . His voice was a low tremble , like a last prayer . " Not Shaka . Please do n't bring him back . " Umpisana 's hand dipped into his pouch again and he withdrew a fistfull of white powder which he threw into the warrior 's cuts . The warrior collapsed and began shaking , foam spilling from his mouth . " Shaka , we are ready to receive your wisdom ! Shaka , reveal yourself ! " The warrior became rigid for a moment and then began to move like an old man rising in the morning . He got up on all fours and studied the ground as if never having seen dirt and mud before . Umpisana turned to the reviewing stand and extended an arm to the warrior . " Shaka ! " The chiefs shifted . No doubt they had heard the awful stories of Shaka , the king who forged the Zulu empire , but few had any firsthand knowledge . Even Cetshwayo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their uncle Shaka , had no memory of him . Only Tshingwayo remembered those days . The old man now flattened himself on the reviewing stand and whimpered . Umpisana turned back to the warrior . " Stand , Shaka . Give us the wisdom of the spirit world . " The warrior turned his head and looked . He braced his arms on the ground and maneuvered his legs underneath him . Once on his feet , he teetered , a scowl carved deep in his face . " Who are you ? " he asked , looking at Umpisana . " I am simply the diviner who called your spirit forth . " " My spirit ? " The warrior 's eyes gazed around and stopped on the reviewing stand and on Cetshwayo . He squinted as if trying to see through a fog . " Who are you ? " It was said as a demand . " I 'm Cetshwayo . " He glanced at Umpisana , but the diviner gave no instructions . Cetshwayo looked back to Shaka 's host . " I am king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of laugh that reminded Cetshwayo of a midnight walk in the frigid rain . " Is that a joke ? Little Cetshwayo is with his mother somewhere shitting his baby cloth . " The warrior 's eyes narrowed . " Why are you in the king 's place of honor ? Why are you in my place ? " Cetshwayo gulped . " Shaka , you died long ago . Only your spirit is here with us now in the body of a warrior . " " Died ? " The warrior looked at his hands , turning them about . " I remember being in the corral . Dingane and Mpande were coming at me with knives - " Cetshwayo had no experience in speaking with spirits , but this was not the conversation he had envisioned . He needed Shaka to give him a blessing from the spirit world . " Shaka . We will soon fight the British . Before we send you back to our ancestors , will you give us your blessing ? " The warrior looked at Cetshwayo . " Blessing ? No blessing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead the impi in my rightful place ! And after I slice open your belly and leave you to the hyenas , I 'll hunt down those traitors , Dingane and Mpande ! " Cetshwayo was about to bellow a curse at Umpisana when Tshingwayo let out a shriek . The old man leapt off the reviewing stand , snatched up the fallen iKlawa and plunged it into the warrior 's stomach . The warrior-host screamed and his legs went limp , but he did not fall . Tshingwayo still held hi up by the iKlawa 's shaft . He put his weight behind the spear until the steel blade erupted from the warrior 's back . He spit in the dying man 's face . " Back to the underworld with you , Shaka ! Back to the flames ! " At last , Tshingwayo let the warrior drop , blood and bile flowing from his mouth . Before his eyes faded , he rolled his head toward Cetshwayo . " Curse you . Curse you and all who follow you . " I AM THE SNAKE . Nokukhanya drifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloudy night helped hide her , but the rain had stopped so she had to be mindful of the rustle of her beads . A single warrior stood at the entrance . She cursed her poor planning . Had she started earlier , she would not have had to contend with a guard . But she could make do , and magic always helped . Her hand brushed the panel on her hip - blue beads on Gaboon Viper skin . I am the snake . She approached the rear of the hut and crept around to the front . The warrior , a young man from the Ulundi corral , leaned on one of his longer throwing spears . His isiHlangu lay nearby . She moved closer to the entrance . If the warrior looked to his left , she would be discovered . Magic could not make her invisible . But his lazy glances at the quiet village were not a danger . She was nothing more than a snake sliding silently in the dark . The warrior sighed and squatted . Nokukhanya darted through the entrance , hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held her breath and listened . Nothing . She stood for a moment to let her breathing return to normal . She waited for her eyes to adjust to the shadow of the hut , but the weak moonlight leaking in through the entrance was no more than a ghost 's breath . She would never see without a candle . She began to grope about . A low table dominated the hut and on it , a water jug . There were blankets , candles , empty bowls - enough to make a visitor comfortable . Nokukhanya lay down next to the wall farthest from the entrance and covered herself with a blanket , making a fold to peek through . If she positioned herself well , it would appear as if someone had merely dropped the blanket on the dirt floor . She did not have to wait long . Flickering orange bit away at the moonlight . There was the sound of shuffling and the harsh exchange of words . Umpisana entered with a reed torch in his hand . The flame drenched the hut in bronze , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch before . He went straight to the candles and grabbed a few with his free hand . Umpisana left but returned moments later without the torch and carrying lit candles , which he placed on the table . He took several more candles , lit them and placed them on the table and around the hut . The burning candles caused the air to grow heavy with the smell of cow dung . Dull yellow light now filled the hut . Nokukhanya gulped down a shiver . She had not been discovered yet , but that was only a matter of time . Her only hope of escape would be a dash for the door . If she was caught , she would have to fight . Umpisana did not look especially strong perhaps she could overpower him as she had done the young Ulundi warrior in Cetshwayo 's hut . Umpisana left again and returned carrying a pack by its strap and a rolled up blanket slung over his shoulder . The pack gave a metal clank as it slid from his hand to the floor . He gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bound into a log-shape by twine and bulged on one end , tapering at the other . It was the exact shape of a child . Nokukhanya bit her lip to keep from yelping . How could she have been so blind ? Umpisana opened his pack and withdrew a roll of black leather , something only white men made . He unrolled it , revealing an assortment of bright steel knives , all with tiny blades the size of crickets . She had seen the like before used by white doctors . They called them scalpels . Umpisana picked up one of the knives and studied its keen edge . He reached for his bundled blanket but then wheeled like a buffalo and ripped away her covering . Nokukhanya could only roll away . Umpisana followed , knife poised , until she was trapped sitting against the wall . She screamed to the guard outside . " Ulundi warrior ! Help me ! " Umpisana laughed . " Do n't you remember my agreement with Cetshwayo ? No one may enter , even if they hear screaming coming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the scalpel . She once had seen a British doctor use one to peel away skin from a Zulu patient with the ease of a painter 's stroke . She touched the snakeskin panel on her hip and looked into Umpisana 's cruel eyes . " I am the Gaboon Viper . " His eyes widened and he took a step back . It was an easy bluff , one he would figure out in no time . He took another step back , lowered his knife and smiled . " I 'm not going to hurt you . I just wanted to scare you . You should n't be in here . " Nokukhanya rose , keeping her back against the wall . She eyed the entrance , guessing it would take three full strides to reach it . But Umpisana seemed to lose interest in her . He put the knife away , knelt and began taking other items from his pack . " What did you hope to find anyway ? Or were you just spying on me ? " Her panic ebbed a bit . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bundle on the table . Umpisana looked up and followed her stare . " Still think I 'm a sorcerer ? " She flinched as he picked up the knife again , but he went straight to the bundle . He cut a cord and pulled open the very end of the blanket to expose stripped tree branches . " I need a particular type of wood for my fires . I had to cover them to keep them dry . " Nokukhanya leaned toward the bundle for a better look , but he covered the wood back up . They could be branches . " I 'm ... sorry for mistrusting you . " She took a few tentative steps along the wall toward the entrance . He ignored her and began unpacking food . " I heard about your bargain with the king , " he said . " You think you can usurp the Right Hand queen and bear the Zulu king 's heir ? " Nokukhanya nodded . Umpisana took a toy-sized red drum out of his pack and set it aside . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having you bring me here . We 're in a struggle greater than I first realized . This approaching war is more important than your petty social climbing or Cetshwayo 's nightmares . " Nokukhanya had shuffled all the way around the hut and now had her back to the entrance . She could escape at any time . " What 's so important about this war ? " He looked down at the toy drum . " It 's about stopping all foreign influence in Zululand and even in Natal and Transvaal . It 's about saving all of the tribes , not just the Zulus . " He looked at her . " Our children are in love with the white man 's ways . They 're learning English and Dutch . They 're becoming Christians . They seek white medicine , not tribal healing . " He looked sadly at the drum . " We 're dying . " " But I prefer glass beads , " she said . He laughed . " So do I sometimes . But with the Europeans gone , we 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " An ironic choice of words , she thought . " Umpisana ? " He looked at her . " I never told you it was a lizard spirit that had visited me . " His eyes flickered for the briefest of moments . " I can summon Intulo , the lizard god . It could only have been a lizard spirit . " " Yes . You 're right , of course . " She turned to leave . " Wait . " She looked back . " I must ask a favor of you . I find that I 'm in need of a spirit trap . " " A spirit trap ? Why ? " " It 's necessary for the summoning spell . I do n't have the bead weaving skills to do it myself , and only you have the magic to make one . " " But spirit traps are for the spirits of living humans . What good is one for Intulo ? " Umpisana turned abrupt . " It just works . I 'll worry about Intulo ! " She nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage . " He turned back to his pack . She gave the bundle on the table one last look . They might be blanches . It was a long walk back to the hut Cetshwayo had provided her on the far side of the village . Umpisana had almost bluffed his way out of his lizard spirit slip . The explanation was almost believable . But she had never mentioned anything to him about Cetshwayo 's nightmares . A scream pierced the night , causing Nokukhanya to skid to a halt and hold her breath . It started as a low whine and quickly rose to a feral howl , echoing through the sleeping village . It faded to nothingness , leaving her with cold dread . It was the scream of a child . " Umpisana ! " Nokukhanya glared at the guard . He glared back , not allowing her any closer to the hut . The mind-dulling throb of two hundred drums stopped and the chant of the three thousand warriors from the Ulundi regiment died with it . " Umpisana ! " She could hear her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears made it seem like a distant call . Umpisana appeared , scowling . His scowl dissolved when he looked into her face . He came running over . " What is it ? " " War doctors ! " Umpisana started a quick trot across the village toward the pasture . Nokukhanya ran next to him . The drums began again and another regiment took up its song . The entire impi was assembled away from the village in the pasture next to the Ulundi corral , but their song was so loud that Umpisana had to yell for Nokukhanya to hear . " What are they doing ? " " I 'm not sure , " said Nokukhanya . " They dug a shallow pit and started putting things around it - a broken iKlawa , an old bowl , a beaded collar . I asked an Ulundi woman what they were , and she said they were Shaka 's possessions . They bring them out for special ceremonies , but the war doctors got a hold of them and placed them around the pit . " They passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that led to the corral and pasture . The impi , twenty thousand warriors strong , stretched before them . The king 's reviewing stand was situated at the end of the pasture near the corral . The impi had transformed from the quiet men sitting under their isiHlangu to escape the rain Nokukhanya had seen three days earlier . They still remained separated into their regiments , but they had replaced their drab head rings and blankets with war regalia . And like their songs and dances , their battlewear was distinctive by regiment . Some wore leopard loin coverings while others preferred otter fur . Feathers of every kind lashed like whips as warriors danced to the drums . All warriors wore flowing ox tails , some around their biceps and knees , others as neck coverings . Officers distinguished themselves with fur capes . The umCityo regiment was now center focus , singing their war song while dancing with a right-footed double hop and a thrust with the iKlawa . Their isiHlangu waved like great fans , creating a cooling wind throughout the pasture . The noise was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she needed her hands free to communicate . She tapped Umpisana on the arm and pointed at the reviewing stand . Cetshwayo stood there flanked by the Great Ones and the chiefs , all dressed for war with weapons at their sides . They watched the umCityo regiment perform , their faces as severe as the call for killing in the song . There was another smaller ceremony occurring next to the reviewing stand . Nokukhanya and Umpisana moved closer . Three war doctors in long beaded headdresses , similar to those of diviners , stood near a pit no deeper than a man 's arm . They used hands to beat out a lively rhythm on drums tucked under one arm . They chanted , even though their words were lost in the din of the war song . A fourth war doctor was directing a line of warriors along one side of the pit . A warrior walked forward and the war doctor gave him a drink from a cup , which caused him to vomit . The war doctor turned the warrior so that he vomited into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another moved up to add his vomit to the pit . Umpisana pointed to the war doctors and bellowed at Cetshwayo . " Make them stop ! " There was no way to be heard over the singing and drums . If the king or anyone else on the reviewing stand saw Umpisana gesturing , they ignored him . Nokukhanya studied Cetshwayo . Aside from his fierce expression , she noticed his eyes were bloodshot and he was not blinking . She grabbed Umpisana 's arm and put her lips to his ear . " Watch out ! They 've been smoking dagga ! " Umpisana pushed her away and walked in front of the reviewing stand waving his hands . Again he yelled and gestured at the war doctors , but he was too far away for Nokukhanya to hear his words . Cetshwayo 's eyes flashed and he bellowed something back . Umpisana gave no response . Cetshwayo grabbed a throwing spear from one of the chiefs and lobbed it at the diviner 's chest . Umpisana dived away and the spear buried itself in the muddy earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Nokukhanya . He stopped next to her and brushed mud off of his body . " He said " no . ' " Nokukhanya and Umpisana watched as the war doctors ended the procession of warriors . One war doctor jumped into the knee-deep vomit with a rhinoceros-horn ladle while another spread a piece of leather on the ground next to the pit . The war doctor in the pit began to ladle vomit onto the leather . After several ladle-fulls , the war doctor next to the pit motioned for the first to stop his scooping . He then began to sew the ends of the leather together , trapping the vomit inside . Both ends of a bead rope were attached to the vomit bag . Nokukhanya felt Umpisana 's grip on her arm , and she was pulled back toward the village . By the time they were halfway back to his hut , the noise had diminished to the point where they could carry on a conversation . " What was that thing ? " Nokukhanya asked . " It 's called the " national ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic probably the most powerful magic the war doctors have . " " What does it do ? " " I 'm not sure . I 've heard of it only in stories . Powerful protection , I know that much . " " Why did you want them to stop ? " Umpisana stopped and turned to her , anger in his eyes . " War doctors are just troublemakers . Schemers . They want to stop me from calling Intulo . " Nokukhanya rattled her head . " I do n't understand . How will the national ring stop your spell ? " " It just will ! Do you have the spirit trap ready ? " " Yes . But I - " " Good , " he said . " Let 's hurry . " They ducked into his hut , which blocked enough noise to allow them to speak without yelling . Umpisana went to the table where a blanket hid what appeared to be a small body . " You know if we fail , Cetshwayo will kill us both . " She hesitated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Your life depends on my success . You know that , do n't you ? " She forced herself to look at him . Her voice sounded weak . " I ... yes , I understand ... but - " He turned to the table . " This is not the time for weak feet . There 's no turning back , and we have to hurry . " He pulled the blanket away . Nokukhanya found herself sitting against the wall , Umpisana shaking her back to wakefulness . Her throat was sore and her chest hurt as if she had screamed out every bit of air in her lungs . A red blotch of a nightmare clung to her - a nightmare about a butcher , but he was not butchering a cow . Umpisana helped her up and guided her toward the table . Her legs buckled as the reality of the nightmare presented itself . Umpisana caught her and forced her to look . It was a boy , although there was little left to tell . Instead of being butchered open like a cow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white tendons . Every bit of skin was gone , even the scalp . It was impossible even to tell if the boy had been native or European . She choked back her bile and looked closer into his face . The boy 's eyes shifted and looked back . Again , she found herself being helped back to her feet . " You 've got to stop fainting . We 're in haste . " Nokukhanya fought down a heave in her stomach . " You ... mm ... monster ! " " Perhaps , " he said . " But if this monster fails , we 're both dead . " He let her stand , swaying , and walked around the far side of the table where a scalpel sat next to the boy . " Of course , you would n't have any appreciation for the art this entails , would you ? " She gawked at him . " Art ? The art of torture ? The art of keeping someone alive while you remove his skin ? " His face twisted into a snarl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools , perfecting the spell , keeping the body moist and free of infection for days . It 's pure art . " Hysteria ate at her . " You 're insane ! " He sputtered a laugh . " Hardly . The spell is an old one . It 's usually done with cattle to summon minor spirits . I discovered it could be used to summon gods . All it required was a young human sacrifice . " " Let him go , " she said weakly . " Let him die . " " He 's really not suffering anymore , " Umpisana said . " The process drives them mad in the early stages . I 'm sure his mind is in a happier place . But I hear your plea . We both must hurry . Where is the spirit trap ? " Nokukhanya reached into a pocket in her maiden 's apron and pulled it out . It was nothing more than a drawstring pouch covered in green and white beads woven in a wedge pattern . The beads , infused with magic , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Cover his nose and mouth with the trap 's opening . All I have to do is cut off one remaining patch of skin . The spell will then end and he 'll die , releasing his spirit . " She complied . She wondered if the pouch on the boy 's body caused him pain , but he gave no reaction . Maybe Umpisana had told the truth and the boy was well away from this world and his horrible ending . " I 'm sorry , " she whispered . She struggled not to cry , afraid that her salty tears might hurt him . " That 's right , " Umpisana said , looking on . He picked up the scalpel and regarded its edge . " Why are you in such a hurry ? " Umpisana 's eyes shifted . " He 's near death . If he dies , we 'll fail and we will both die . " " But you were n't in a hurry when I called you out to see the war doctors . " " Yes I was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Liar ! He mentioned the need for haste only after seeing the national ring - magical protection for Cetshwayo . Umpisana cut into the boy . Nokukhanya shuddered as the boy unleashed his last agonized scream . Evidently his mind was not so far gone as to ignore his body 's demise . As the boy 's eyes closed and his lungs emptied , the spirit bag filled . She drew the strings tight and tied them off . Umpisana beamed at her . " Success ! You 've ensured both of our lives . Give me the trap . " For the first time in the day , she had a reason to smile . Umpisana 's smile did not last . " I said , give it to me . " She made a side step toward the entrance . Umpisana 's hand tightened on the scalpel and he leapt across the table at her . Nokukhanya easily evaded him and ran for the entrance . She turned to face him as he sprawled on the floor . " What 's your hurry now ? You wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spell - when you 're before the British soldiers . Of course , by then , Cetshwayo will be wearing the national ring , wo n't he ? " Umpisana pointed the scalpel at her . " Give it to me now or you 'll end up like this boy ! " She shivered at the threat but refused to show fear . " I 'm not powerless , Umpisana . And even if you find a way to capture me , I 'll have hidden the trap so you 'll never find it . You 'll have to wait for the battle with the British . " She turned and left . Umpisana bellowed rage from within the hut . The Ulundi guard glanced back at the entrance and then at her as she passed . Nokukhanya smiled . " Your orders are not to go in , remember ? " Cetshwayo took a drink from the water jug , replaced the stopper and set it aside . It was sunny at midday , and plenty of light from the hut 's entrance meant they could save the candles-if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You have n't run with your warriors for twenty years , " said Ngqumbazi . She was wearing all of her beaded accessories - cape , head piece , belt and apron , anklets and bracelets . What she could not wear she was tying off in a bundle to carry . " I 'll keep up , " he said . " Besides , I wo n't be the problem . For some reason that woman diviner , Nokukhanya , is coming along . " He placed the national ring around his neck and put on his ostrich-feather headdress . " Are my feathers straight ? " Ngqumbazi stood and began fiddling with the feathers , prodding them into place . " Who will lead the buffalo 's chest ? " " Tshingwayo . " She stopped fiddling and looked at him . " Tshingwayo is seventy years old ! " " He can run half a day at a near sprint and fight a battle afterward . " She snorted . " His bladder is weak . He 'll have to take a dozen breaks before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's horns ? " " Mavumengwana will lead the left horn . Dabulamanzi , the right . " Ngqumbazi went back to her packing , turning her attention to the leopard furs . " Have those two settled their differences ? " " It does n't matter . They 'll be far away from each other , attacking from opposite sides while Tshingwayo leads the chest straight on . " He picked up his iKlawa and two throwing spears and glanced around . " I must have left my isiHlangu outside . " Ngqumbazi threw down the furs and ran to him , wrapping her arms around him . " I 'll never see you again ! I 've heard there are thousands of British soldiers crossing the Tugela River ! " He hugged her , feeling hot tears on his chest . " We 'll win . You 'll see . " She pushed herself away . " You still think those two diviners will save us ? Look what they 've done for you already . After that curse from Shaka 's spirit , half the chiefs took their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you only have twenty thousand ! " Cetshwayo felt his anger rise . " I should 've killed that diviner-killed them both ! " " You still can , " she said . " Send warriors and be done with them . They 're bad luck . " He shook his head . The diviners were all he had left . If the spell to summon Intulo did not work , the impi would charge into British rifle fire - his nightmare revealed . He looked at her . " I 'm leaving fifty warriors with Dinuzulu . He 'll take you and all of the women up into the hills until we return . " " You want her to succeed ! You 're looking forward to marrying her ! I 've seen the way you look at her . It 's the way you used to look at me ! " Cetshwayo picked up his water jug . " Is it such a bad bargain ? If she saves the Zulus the only price is she 'll become my wife . And I 'll have to pay Umpisana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another step back and , as quick as a snake strike , pulled a knife from her apron . At first , Cetshwayo thought she was going to attack , but instead , she held it up for him to see . " Not a bad bargain at all , " she said , giving him a heartless smile . " I 'll even bless your wedding night . But I swear by my ancestors , I 'll kill her the next day ! " CETSHWAYO tossed his headdress and iKlawa aside and crawled up the side of the hill , Tshingwayo close behind . The rocky bluffs in this part of Zululand were desolate for most of the year , but the heavy rain and yesterday 's sun had sprinkled patches of color among the gray rocks . Fragrant wild flowers pushed up from every crevice deep enough to hold a handful of dirt , and grass brushed the hills in soft green . They reached the top and peered over . Tshingwayo pointed . " There ! With their backs against Isandlwana ! " In the valley was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding cooking fires , tending horses and oxen , pitching tents and cleaning weapons . Indeed , they had chosen to rest at the foot of the butte Tshingwayo had named - Isandlwana . Almost all of the soldiers wore bright jackets , turning the valley into a sea of red . Tshingwayo used his hand to shield the sun from his eyes . " Something 's wrong . " Cetshwayo studied the British more closely . The oxen-pulled wagons had not been circled around the resting army . The Boers used the defensive circling technique with deadly affect . The British knew this strategy too , but were neglecting it . Were they so confident they thought it unnecessary ? Were they so powerful ? One of the closest wagons caught his eye . The oxen had been unhitched and a dozen men surrounded it using planks and branches as levers . The wagon 's wheels were half sunk in mud . Tshingwayo looked at him and grinned . " They 're stuck ! Who would 've thought this rain would be a blessing ? The water will save us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew the water would not save them . It was just a wishful thought . British bullets would harvest Zulus like millet . A column of cavalry broke away from camp riding two abreast . They snaked away , hugging the hills to avoid the muddy flatland . Cetshwayo shook his head . " Why are they splitting their forces ? " Tshingwayo snapped his fingers . " The spirits favor us . We can forget the diviner and his magic . You should order the attack . " " No . " Tshingwayo hesitated for a moment . " Why not ? " Cetshwayo turned away and sat , looking down the hill . " Bullets , rockets , cannon .... " Tshingwayo sighed and sat next to him . " The warriors have been singing and dancing for three days . You heard the boasting . " Cetshwayo nodded . The boasting had started the first day , and he had been powerless to stop it . An umCityo regimental warrior had approached the reviewing stand and announced he would be the first to kill a British soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ngobamakosi regiment strutted forward and said he would break off the strangely bearded jaw of one of the British soldiers and present it to the king . The first countered that the umCityo were better singers . The second proclaimed the Ngobamakosi to be better dancers . Yelling broke out including plenty of pointing and name-calling , but as soon as the accusation of " weak feet " was shouted , weapons were raised . Thirteen had died before Cetshwayo and the chiefs could restore order . " Remember the boasts made , " said Tshingwayo . " Honor is at stake . " " I remember , " said Cetshwayo . " But they 'll follow my orders . " " You 'll make yourself vulnerable . Hamu will seize upon their anger and bring war against you . You 'll never be safe . " Cetshwayo laughed . " No Zulu is ever truly safe . Except perhaps my exiled brother , Mbulazi , living alone in Natal like a toothless lion . " He stood . " Send a runner . Bring the impi up to the valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And bring the diviners and chiefs to me . " Tshingwayo nodded , scampered down the hill and trotted off . Cetshwayo peeked over the hill again . The British almost had one of their wagons free of the mud . He counted twenty still stuck fast . The enemy had the advantage in pure killing power , but he had an advantage in numbers . He could move twenty thousand Zulus into spearthrowing distance without the British ever knowing . If the diviner 's magic failed , he would attack . The Zulus probably would be slaughtered to the man , but at least they would draw enough blood to earn themselves a name in the list of epic battles the British were so fond of recounting . Cetshwayo looked from eye to eye : the chiefs ; Hamu , his plotting brother ; Sihayo , his closest ally ; old Tshingwayo ; the two diviners . He even spared a glance at the one hundred warriors from the Ngobamakosi regiment who acted as their guard while they were exposed . The warriors , conspicuous with their leopard headbands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders back and chests forward . He was king of the impi - king of the Zulus , and even though it was a dangerous thought , he felt he could lead the attack straight into the smoking fire of the British . By the looks he received in return , they felt it too . Even Hamu 's eyes gleamed with pride . The ocean of blood . Cetshwayo rattled his head to clear the thought . He would not order the attack , not yet . Not until all was lost and death no longer mattered . He looked at Tshingwayo . " Where are the war doctors ? " The old man shrugged . " The diviners would come only if the war doctors stayed behind . " Cetshwayo , jaw clenched , turned toward Nokukhanya . She shook her head , eyes wide . " Not me - him . " She pointed at Umpisana who stood some twenty paces away from her . Cetshwayo had noticed that the two diviners stayed far apart for the entire trip across Zululand . Umpisana nodded . " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men full of superstitions . " " I make those decisions ! " Cetshwayo pointed his iKlawa at the diviner . " You 've been a curse to me ever since you arrived - refusing to bow down , angering Shaka 's spirit , screams coming from your hut . If this magic does n't work , you 'll lead the attack with nothing more than your bare hands ! " Umpisana gave a controlled , almost mocking smile . " I assure you , the magic will work to perfection . " Cetshwayo glared at him . " Then do it ! " The diviner glanced about . " Perhaps fewer guards . We do n't want to be seen . " Cetshwayo gnawed his lower lip and thought . Once they moved from behind the hill , they would be in view of the British , but they would be so far away , they would probably go unnoticed . Still , fewer numbers would help their need to remain hidden . He pointed . " Hamu , Sihayo , Tshingwayo and five warriors . " He led the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the butte rising above them . " Hurry . " Cetshwayo squatted to lessen his profile as did the others . Only the diviners remained standing . " The woman will approach , " said Umpisana . Nokukhanya shot Cetshwayo a frightened look before joining Umpisana . Cetshwayo guessed that Umpisana 's refusal to use her name was a result of some sort of rift . They could kill each other for all he cared . That would solve several problems . Just as long as they cast the spell first . Umpisana pulled a small bound lizard from his pouch , gave it a quick cut and set it on the ground . It hissed and thrashed while its blood oozed . The diviner unslung a drum from his shoulder and began tapping out a quick cadence while circling the lizard in a shuffling dance . Cetshwayo regarded the British forces again . There was little sign of movement . Even if they were spotted and soldiers were sent to attack , it would be too late . Intulo would rear up among them and devour their general . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tshingwayo caused Cetshwayo to look back . The tiny lizard had tripled in size , breaking its bonds . It writhed , and its hiss turned into a tortured growl . A bulbous swell grew on its back and when its skin could withstand it no longer , it burst , exposing a glistening , green tube open on its end . The smell of decay was thick . The tube , three fists wide and as long as a throwing spear , swayed and pulsated . Cetshwayo , his horror having sucked away his breath , had the impression that the tube was waiting for something , sniffing for it . " The spirit trap ! " Umpisana roared . " Feed it the trap ! " Spirit trap ? Cetshwayo forced away his doubts - the screams from Umpisana 's tent . He knew there would be a price beyond cattle and girls , but it was worth paying to be rid of the British . Nokukhanya hesitated , staring at the searching tube . Umpisana buried a fist in her stomach , sending her to the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belt and kicked her over when she tried to rise . He then lobbed the bag into the tube 's opening . There was a popping sound and a few stray beads spewed from the opening . The speed of the events was confusing , but Cetshwayo was certain he saw the ghostly image of a child 's head peeking out of the tube 's opening with terrified and pleading eyes . With a whoosh the head was sucked into the tube . There was a sound of crunching bones and splitting cartilage as the lizard underwent a new change , adding clawed arms , stout legs and a scalearmored backbone . Worst of all was its crocodile head with rows of teeth and maniacal intelligence behind cold eyes . It stood a full fence post taller than the tallest man Cetshwayo had ever seen . Umpisana approached the beast with arms spread . " Intulo . We are honored by your presence . " The lizard god remained motionless , eyes on the diviner . Cetshwayo noticed Nokukhanya staggering to her feet . She cradled her stomach and coughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give you a gift - fresh human meat . A blood-feast all for you ! " Intulo gave a quick snap of his jaws , sending a shiver up Cetshwayo 's back . Umpisana pointed . " Intulo , I give you Cetshwayo , king of the Zulus ! " " Traitor ! " someone shouted - it might have been Sihayo , but Cetshwayo did not have time to think about it . The image of death in the form of the lizard god was stomping toward him . He barely had time to jump and grab his weapons . A few spears from the warriors glanced off Intulo 's hide with no effect . Fear betrayed his legs and he stumbled . But before Intulo could pounce , the national ring , which hung from his neck , burst . What issued forth was not three-day-old stewed vomit , but a midnight mist that swirled before Intulo , stopping his advance . The mist took the solid form of a Zulu warrior , pure black and featureless like carved stone . It held an iKlawa in one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an ostrich-feather headdress , also black and stone-like . Standing as tall as Intulo , it pointed its weapon at the lizard god . " Kill him ! " Umpisana raged . " Kill Cetshwayo ! " Intulo stepped to the side , but the warrior spirit mirrored him . Umpisana bellowed in pain . Cetshwayo chanced a look and saw Nokukhanya backing away from Umpisana , a knife in her hand . Blood flowed from Umpisana 's side and he dropped to his knees . " Kill Nokukhanya ! Kill the witch ! " Intulo wheeled and sprang toward Nokukhanya . Cetshwayo turned to his spirit guardian . " Stop him ! Kill Intulo ! " But the guardian merely lowered its weapon and stood . Nokukhanya had no chance for escape . She could not even raise her knife in defense , not that it would have done any good . Intulo snapped down , severing her torso from her hips . He then vanished without a sign . The spirit guardian disappeared with him . Tshingwayo rushed forward . " Are you hurt ? " Cetshwayo stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine , but it would 've been better if Intulo had killed me . " The old man gave him a cross look . " Why do you say that ? " " Now , I will preside over the death of the Zulu people . If any of us survive this battle , we 'll be forced to watch the British change our ways , our religion , our rightful place in Africa . " Cetshwayo and Tshingwayo walked over to the others as they raised their iKlawa and surrounded the crawling Umpisana . Two warriors grabbed the diviner and pulled him to his knees . He looked up at Cetshwayo , blood oozing from his smile . Cetshwayo resisted the urge to strike . " Who ? " Umpisana coughed a bit . " Why , your brother , Mbulazi of course . He did n't want you to forget about his exile in Natal . " " And you contrived everything ? My dreams ? Nokukhanya 's spirit messenger ? " The diviner nodded . " Everything . And I would 've killed you in the village and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Nokukhanya . Even with his battle experience , her remains were difficult to look at . " She died to save me - to save the Zulus . " He wondered what his wife would say . " Your end comes either way , " said Umpisana . " You 've called the impi and now you must fight and die . Your brother hardly cares about the method of your death . " Cetshwayo motioned to Sihayo . Sihayo thrust his iKlawa down into the diviner 's chest and withdrew it in a spout of blood . The warriors let him fall . The rocky ground would not accept the blood , and it flowed around Cetshwayo 's feet like water . The sound of running caused them all to turn . The other Ngobamakosi regimental warriors were approaching , evidently sensing that something was wrong . Sihayo waved his arms and shouted . " No ! Go back ! We 'll be seen ! " Cetshwayo put a hand on Sihayo 's shoulder . " It 's all right . Now is the time to strike . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mavumengwana - take the buffalo 's left horn and attack south . Dabulamanzi is to lead the buffalo 's right horn and attack from the north . " The warrior sprinted off . Hamu stepped forward . " I have two thousand warriors . Where do you want me ? " Cetshwayo smiled and slapped his half-brother 's shoulder . " Join Tshingwayo . He will lead the buffalo 's chest . " Hamu smiled in return . Cetshwayo took strange comfort in Hamu 's loyalty . Were these peaceful days , they would be plotting the other 's assassination . Now , they would die together on the battlefield . " Cetshwayo .... " He wheeled , iKlawa raised . Umpisana , whom he had assumed was dead , was back on his knees , a scowl on his face . " Cetshwayo . I remember when your mother would suckle you during the reed gathering . " Tshingwayo raised his iKlawa . " Your magic ca n't keep you alive forever ! " Cetshwayo grabbed the old man 's weapon . " It 's not Umpisana - it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shaka ? " Fear infected his voice and it dropped to a whisper . " Not Shaka ! " " Cetshwayo . You 're really king of the Zulus ? " Cetshwayo nodded , tight grip on his weapon . " You want to defeat the British ? " His breath caught in his throat , but he managed a nod again . " You are attacking with the buffalo charge ? The horns on each side and the chest in the middle ? " " Let me kill him , Cetshwayo , " said Tshingwayo in a croaking voice . " Let me send him away to the eternal suffering he deserves . " " No , not yet ! " He turned to Shaka 's host . " Tell me . How do I defeat the British ? " " Keep three regiments in the buffalo 's loins . " " The buffalo 's loins ? " Cetshwayo slapped his iKlawa against his isiHlangu . " I do n't know what that means ! Buffalo 's loins ? " " Do n't be impatient ! " Shaka said with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not to attack . But they must be the best regiments - the Ngobamakosi , the umCityo and the Ombane . " Tshingwayo turned to Cetshwayo . " Three regiments ? They 'll go insane with the killing lust ! They 'll revolt ! " " Tshingwayo ? Is that you ? " Tshingwayo looked at Shaka 's host , loathing in his eyes . " You have no sway over me anymore . You 're a worthless ghost ! " Shaka laughed . " You 're old now , but when you struck me down at my first return , your thrust was that of a true Zulu . You will be in command of the buffalo 's loins . Order them to turn their backs to the battle so that they will not be enraged by the killing lust . After three charges by the buffalo 's chest , let them loose . " Tshingwayo looked at Cetshwayo . " I do n't know .... " " Do it , and be quick ! " said Cetshwayo . " Pull those regiments and hold them back ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off toward the valley where the impi was hidden . Cetshwayo pointed at Sihayo and Hamu . " You two will lead the buffalo 's chest . Bring me back red jackets to prove your victory . " They struck iKlawa against isiHlangu and sped away , taking the warrior guards with them . Cetshwayo was left alone . He looked at Umpisana - Shaka 's host . " You 've done it . You 'll save the Zulu people . " Umpisana 's eyes turned lifeless and his body pitched forward . He slowly rolled to face upward . Shaka 's voice was labored and distant . " This is my revenge , you fool . My revenge for the betrayal of your father and his half-brother who assassinated me . You 'll defeat the British today , but they 'll come back looking for you - looking for revenge - and they 'll turn Zululand into an ocean of blood . " At the Battle of Isandlwana , 1879 , most in the British invasion force headedfor Ulundi were killed , including 800 soldiers , 52officersand500 native allies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An estimated 3000 Zulus of the 20,000 strong impi died . The British learned a costly lesson and became more diligent in encircling their camps with wagons . The Battle of Isandlwana will always be a part of British military lore . It was one of the last engagements in which the British wore red jackets . After three more bloody engagements that year , Cetshwayo was captured and exiled to London . He returned to Zululand in 1883 to act as a puppet king for the British , but a rival Zulu clan with the aid of the Boers chased him into hiding . He died in 1884 . Cetshwayo 's son , Dinuzulu , inherited the Zulu throne that year . Shaka , his blood relatives , and their descendants have controlled the Zulu throne from 1781 to the current day . At the writing of this story , Goodwill Zwelethini is king of Zululand , now called KwaZulu-Natal province , part of South Africa . His position is purely ceremonia . <p>                @ @ @ @ @
