AUTHOR ? S NOTE // Legacy of Ashes is the record of the first sixty years of the Central Intelligence Agency . It describes how the most powerful country in the history of Western civilization has failed to create a first-rate spy service . That failure constitutes a danger to the national security of the United States . Intelligence is secret action aimed at understanding or changing what goes on abroad . President Dwight D. Eisenhower called it " a distasteful but vital necessity . " A nation that wants to project its power beyond its borders needs to see over the horizon , to know what is coming , to prevent attacks against its people . It must anticipate surprise . Without a strong , smart , sharp intelligence service , presidents and generals alike can become blind and crippled . But throughout its history as a superpower , the United States has not had such a service . // History , Edward Gibbon wrote in The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , is " little more than the register of crimes , follies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central Intelligence Agency are filled with folly and misfortune , along with acts of bravery and cunning . They are replete with fleeting successes and long-lasting failures abroad . They are marked by political battles and power struggles at home . The agency ? s triumphs have saved some blood and treasure . Its mistakes have squandered both . They have proved fatal for legions of American soldiers and foreign agents ; some three thousand Americans who died in New York , Washington , and Pennsylvania on September 11 , 2001 ; and three thousand more who have died since then in Iraq and Afghanistan . The one crime of lasting consequence has been the CIA ? s inability to carry out its central mission : informing the president of what is happening in the world . // The United States had no intelligence to speak of when World War II began , and next to none a few weeks after the war ended . A mad rush to demobilize left behind a few hundred men who had a few years ? experience in the world of secrets and the will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major powers except the United States have had for a long time past permanent worldwide intelligence services , reporting directly to the highest echelons of their Government , " General William J. Donovan , the commander of the wartime Office of Strategic Services , warned President Truman in August 1945 . " Prior to the present war , the United States had no foreign secret intelligence service . It never has had and does not now have a coordinated intelligence system . " Tragically , it still does not have one . // The CIA was supposed to become that system . But the blueprint for the agency was a hasty sketch . It was no cure for a chronic American weakness : secrecy and deception were not our strengths . The collapse of the British Empire left the United States as the sole force able to oppose Soviet communism , and America desperately needed to know those enemies , to provide foresight to presidents , and to fight fire with fire when called upon to light the fuse . The mission of the CIA , above all , was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pearl Harbor . // The agency ? s ranks were filled with thousands of patriotic Americans in the 1950s . Many were brave and battle-hardened . Some had wisdom . Few really knew the enemy . Where understanding failed , presidents ordered the CIA to change the course of history through covert action . " The conduct of political and psychological warfare in peacetime was a new art , " wrote Gerald Miller , then the CIA ? s covert-operations chief for Western Europe . " Some of the techniques were known but doctrine and experience were lacking . " The CIA ? s covert operations were by and large blind stabs in the dark . The agency ? s only course was to learn by doing  --  by making mistakes in battle . The CIA then concealed its failures abroad , lying to Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy . It told those lies to preserve its standing in Washington . The truth , said Don Gregg , a skilled cold-war station chief , was that the agency at the height of its powers had a great reputation and a terrible record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its peril during the Vietnam War . Like the American press , it discovered that its reporting was rejected if it did not fit the preconceptions of presidents . The CIA was rebuked and scorned by Presidents Johnson , Nixon , Ford , and Carter . None of them understood how the agency worked . They took office " with the expectation that intelligence could solve every problem , or that it could not do anything right , and then moved to the opposite view , " notes a former deputy director of central intelligence , Richard J. Kerr . " Then they settled down and vacillated from one extreme to the other . " // To survive as an institution in Washington , the agency above all had to have the president ? s ear . But it soon learned that it was dangerous to tell him what he did not want to hear . The CIA ? s analysts learned to march in lockstep , conforming to conventional wisdom . They misapprehended the intentions and capabilities of our enemies , miscalculated the strength of communism , and misjudged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CIA during the cold war was to steal Soviet secrets by recruiting spies , but the CIA never possessed a single one who had deep insight into the workings of the Kremlin . The number of Soviet spies with important information to reveal-all of them volunteers , not recruits  --  could be counted on the fingers of two hands . And all of them died , captured and executed by Moscow . Almost all had been betrayed by officers of the CIA ? s Soviet division who were spying for the other side , under Presidents Reagan and George H. W. Bush . Under Reagan , the CIA set off on misconceived third-world missions , selling arms to Iran ? s Revolutionary Guards to finance a war in Central America , breaking the law and squandering what trust remained reposed in it . More grievously , it missed the fatal weakness of its main enemy . // It fell to machines , not men , to understand the other side . As the technology of espionage expanded its horizons , the CIA ? s vision grew more and more myopic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They did not deliver the crucial information that communism was crumbling . The CIA ? s foremost experts never saw the enemy until after the cold war was over . The agency had bled the Soviets by pouring billions of dollars of weapons into Afghanistan to help fight the Red Army ? s occupying forces . That was an epic success . But it failed to see that the Islamic warriors it supported would soon take aim at the United States , and when that understanding came , the agency failed to act . That was an epochal failure . // The unity of purpose that held the CIA together during the cold war came undone in the 1990s , under President Clinton . The agency still had people who strove to understand the world , but their ranks were far too thin . There were still talented officers who dedicated themselves to serving the United States abroad , but their numbers were far too few . The FBI had more agents in New York than the CIA had officers abroad . By the end of the century , the agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was becoming a second-echelon field office for the Pentagon , weighing tactics for battles that never came , not strategies for the struggle ahead . It was powerless to prevent the second Pearl Harbor . // After the attacks on New York and Washington , the agency sent a small skilled cadre of covert operators into Afghanistan and Pakistan to hunt down the leaders of al Qaeda . It then forfeited its role as a reliable source of secret information when it handed the White House false reports on the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq . It had delivered a ton of reportage based on an ounce of intelligence . President George W. Bush and his administration in turn misused the agency once proudly run by his father , turning it into a paramilitary police force abroad and a paralyzed bureaucracy at headquarters . Bush casually pronounced a political death sentence upon the CIA in 2004 when he said that the agency was " just guessing " about the course of the war in Iraq . No president had ever publicly dismissed the CIA that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dissolution of the office of director of central intelligence in 2005 . Now the CIA must be rebuilt if it is to survive . That task will take years . The challenge of understanding the world as it is has overwhelmed three generations of CIA officers . Few among the new generation have mastered the intricacies of foreign lands , much less the political culture of Washington . In turn , almost every president , almost every Congress , and almost every director of central intelligence since the 1960s has proved incapable of grasping the mechanics of the CIA . Most have left the agency in worse shape than they found it . Their failures have handed future generations , in the words of President Eisenhower , " a legacy of ashes . " We are back where we began sixty years ago , in a state of disarray . // Legacy of Ashes sets out to show how it has come to pass that the United States now lacks the intelligence it will need in the years ahead . It is drawn from the words , the ideas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American national-security establishment . They record what our leaders really said , really wanted , and really did when they projected power abroad . This book is based on my reading of more than fifty thousand documents , primarily from the archives of the CIA , the White House , and the State Department ; more than two thousand oral histories of American intelligence officers , soldiers , and diplomats ; and more than three hundred interviews conducted since 1987 with CIA officers and veterans , including ten directors of central intelligence . Extensive endnotes amplify the text . // This book is on the record  --  no anonymous sources , no blind quotations , no hearsay . It is the first history of the CIA compiled entirely from firsthand reporting and primary documents . It is , by its nature , incomplete : no president , no director of central intelligence , and certainly no outsider can know everything about the agency . What I have written here is not the whole truth , but to the best of my ability , it is nothing but the truth . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ republic in history has lasted longer than three hundred years , and this nation may not long endure as a great power unless it finds the eyes to see things as they are in the world . That once was the mission of the Central Intelligence Agency . //
