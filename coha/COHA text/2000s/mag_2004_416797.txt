Follow me , " he said , and I did , ducking the rope and breaking the law , violating ski-area policy and risking my pass . And would n't you know itthe snow was deeper , lighter , and drier than what I 'd left behind . When I went to bed that night , I did n't feel the slightest guilt , nothing but the afterglow of fat powder turns and the seductive satisfaction of hiding a secret . How intoxicating the rush of the personal powder stash ! Poachito ergo sum . Few people talk openly about it , but on any given day , I 'd wager there 's more poaching in American ski areas than in all the Denny 's west of the Mississippi . Poaching is neck and neck with dope-smoking as skiing 's biggest open secret , and pretty much everyone I know does it from time to time . This includes the usual skidlike suspects , of coursebut patrollers , instructors , and marketing officials hit the dark side , too . It 's just part of skiing culture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes , reusing lift tickets , and sneakingvia Ho Chi Minh-style trailsonto the upper reaches of mountains , where tickets wo n't be checked . Fighting the power is a sentiment that runs deep among skiers . This does n't make it right , however . Skiing across a closed boundary , or onto a closed run , is wrong . Rules are rules , whether you agree with them or notand if you adhere to a rigid ethical stance , you would n't poach at all . People who argue that ski areas should n't bar us from our public lands or stretch ropes across the mountains ( I 'm one of them ) are offering worthy , if ultimately empty , justifications for their behavior . Skiing is indeed about unfettered freedom , but when we buy a lift pass , we 're making a commitment to follow the rules . The back of the ticket is right . But I 've been out there on countless stormy days , and mostly what I 've seen is a world colored by shades of gray . Which is another way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a winter night is long , I ca n't promise I wo n't poach again . Blame it on Adam , who was given the entire world but still wanted the one thing he could n't have , and in taking it not only got kicked out of paradise but passed down his fatal flaw to every human being who followed him . Poaching as original sin ? Why not ? How else to explain regular violations of ski-area policy except by pointing to the flawed makeup of human character and the powerfully seductive appeal of the taboo ? It 's as good an argument as any . Untouched powder is da kine ; I 'm human and ca n't help myself . Forgive me , Father , for I have poached . I have never poached wantonly or openly , and because I spend most of my time at resorts with open boundaries , I really have n't poached all that much . What little poaching I 've done I 've excused by doing it in what I consider to be a responsible manner . I 've spent many an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrols , shadowing them in gale-force blizzards , and witnessing the kinds of B.S. and foolishness that come of dealing with the public . I certainly do n't want to do anything that makes their job harder or endangers them or others . But there are shades of poaching , just as there are shades of gray in storms . Ducking a boundary rope where the average skier ca n't see you or your tracks is a far cry from ripping up a closed avalanche chute that overhangs a trail . One poach is minor , harmless , and victimless ; the other , serious , dangerous , and counterproductive . I suppose I 'm a boundary libertarian and an inbounds conservative . Some ski patrols are notoriously slow about opening their storm-day trails ( critics of Crested Butte Mountain Resort used to say its initials really meant " Closed Because it 's My Run " ) , and some resorts are ridiculously conservative about allowing access to the gnar , but most inbounds , off-limits trails are closed for damn good reasons . Conditions might be bad . A clueless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger could be high . There are a hundred legitimate reasons for closure . Boundaries are different , however . If a ski area abuts public land , I feel its boundaries should be openperiod . If it abuts private land , it 's the owner 's right to bar trespassing , but all 50 states now have statutes protecting landowners from litigation if a recreational user gets hurt on their property ; thus , there 's no good reason , short of orneriness , to prevent passage . Despite the occasional boneheaded yahoo , skiers are generally responsible about their backcountry sessions and should be trusted . Jackson Hole 's five years of open boundaries are proof that education can increase safety and keep accidents to a minimum . A closed boundary invites poaching . The good news for powder-starved skiers ( and bad news for incorrigible poachers ) is that resorts are in the midst of an unprecedented glasnost . Jackson 's boundary-opening may have been the highest-profile event , but throughout the ski world , resorts have been aggressively granting access to the backcountry . Part of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; part of it comes from smart businesses responding to the desires of their customers . The result is that there are fewer places to poach and fewer reasons to duck a rope , which is n't a bad thing at all . The forbidden fruit tastes pretty sweet , but it 's nice to eat an apple in the light of day , too . Illustration B/W PHOTO : STEVE CASIMIRO // <p>
