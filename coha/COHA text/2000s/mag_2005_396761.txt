You 'll drop pounds faster and keep them off longer if you team up with a buddy . Six dieters show you how <p> Anyone who enjoys a sport like tennis or golf knows that having a partner who plays as well as you do  --  or even better  --  motivates you to practice more and play harder . " So why would n't that same dynamic work for people who diet together ? " wondered Rena Wing , PhD , a behavioral scientist at Brown University . To test her theory , Wing studied 109 people who wanted to lose weight , and their dieting partners . Sure enough , she found that those who had a successful partner dropped twice as many pounds after a year of serious weight loss effort than those who dieted on their own . But men and women whose partners dropped the ball and gave up were no more likely to shed pounds than those who tried losing solo , says Wing , one of the founders of the National Weight Control Registry , a group of more than 4,000 people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off for a year or more . <p> The diet buddies in Wing 's study knew each other , but support does n't have to be one-on-one or even face-to-face . In fact , the latest trend is having a virtual buddy , one you can keep in your pocket or e-mail in the middle of the night . Here , five successful dieters talk about the buddies who helped them meet their goals  --  and point the way for you to imitate their success . the dog lover TABLE <p> When Jill Schmidt 's coworker mentioned that he knew someone who wanted to give away an 8-month-old Jack Russell terrier , this vice president of a public relations firm outside of Chicago was n't thinking about losing weight . " Sight unseen , I said I 'd take her , " she recalls . <p> When Schmidt picked up Princess , she was horrified to discover that the puppy was malnourished and underweight . Schmidt 's weight was at the other extreme . Since becoming a vegetarian 10 years earlier , she had been overdoing it on bread and cheese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Dog and owner had one thing in common : Both had been sedentary . " Princess was kept in a cage in a basement her whole life , " says Schmidt . " She had never even been on a walk . And I was a couch potato . " So Schmidt 's first order of business was to take Princess ( and herself ) for a stroll two or three times a day . " She 'd stop after half a mile , and I 'd pick her up and carry her back , " she says . <p> This pattern went on for months until Schmidt was logging about 16 miles a week  --  half of them carrying the dog . " As Princess gained weight , I started losing it , " says Schmidt . <p> Last summer , prompted by her initial success , she lost 30 pounds in 5 months . Schmidt made an appointment with a dietitian to help get her eating habits under control . The dietitian created a 1,200-calorie-a-day eating plan that emphasized fruits , vegetables , and whole grains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 138 pounds today . <p> Everyone has noticed Schmidt 's new slimmer shape , but she got the biggest tickle from a neighbor who had seen her walking and carrying Princess . " One day he told me he 'd noticed how much weight I 'd lost , and said he was thinking about getting a dog for his wife . " the foodie TABLE <p> After living in California for 14 years , Lucille Kahan , a business manager , returned with her husband to West Chester , PA in April 2003 . " I came back fat , " she says matter-of-factly of tipping the scale at 179 pounds . " When I ran into someone I knew when I was much thinner , I was embarrassed . I did n't want to lose weight to play tennis , live longer , or avoid heart disease . I just wanted to look good , " she says . <p> Even though Kahan had tried and failed with at least half a dozen other diets , her sister suggested she sign up for the Trevose Behavior Modification Program , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 30 years ago at the University of Pennsylvania . The university is no longer involved , but researchers continue to study the group 's progress and consider it among the most successful . <p> Not long into her first meeting , Kahan noticed a huge difference between the Trevose approach and her previous attempts . " On other plans , I could n't eat the foods I liked and , after awhile , I reverted to my old ways . With Trevose , absolutely nothing is forbidden . I could spend my 1,500 calories a day any way I wanted . " The catch is that members must attend every weekly meeting for the first 5 weeks and continue to achieve their weight loss goals , or they 're not allowed to stay in the program . They also make a commitment to keep detailed food records and attend monthly meetings for the rest of their lives . <p> Though the weigh-ins motivated Kahan , the group interaction at the meetings is what kept her coming back . " My group leader told us , ' Nothing tastes as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " During the meetings , she also worked on behavior modifications required by the program  --  a new one for each of her first 5 months . The initial challenge : not eating food at her desk , in her car , or while walking around the house . <p> Kahan reached her goal of 144 pounds last July . " I was ecstatic to fit into clothes that I had n't been able to wear for years , " she says . Not only was she able to resuscitate her own wardrobe , she could now wear a 1930s tailored suit her grandmother had left her . And she 's still losing : Kahan even shed a pound while on vacation at an all-inclusive Caribbean resort with around-the-clock buffets. the chat room cheerleader TABLE <p> Two years ago , Alicia Wilson 's 4-year-old daughters made an announcement that motivated her to take action . " They told me they wanted to be fat , just like me , " recalls Wilson , a stay-at-home mom who weighed nearly 265 pounds at the time . " They were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want my kids to grow up with the same low self-esteem I had . " <p> However , during that period , Wilson was slowly losing weight without really trying . Since moving with her family from California to Grandfield , OK , a year earlier , she had dropped 20 pounds . The farming community of 900 people does n't have a single fast-food restaurant , so her burger-and-fries habit had suddenly become history . But there was one real drawback to the change of address : The town does n't have a single weight loss support group , either . <p> Wilson found a compromise in eDiets.com , a weight loss Web site with 247,000 subscribers as of March 2005 . In October 2003 , Wilson logged on , selecting the eDiets plan from the more than 15 options , ranging from Atkins to vegetarian . Within minutes of entering her height , weight ( then 247 pounds ) , and 60-pound weight loss goal , she received a week 's worth of 2,200-calorie menus , shopping lists , and a workout schedule . Today she walks or jogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength-trains 3 or 4 days a week . <p> At the end of each week , Wilson logs in her weight on eDiets.com , which adjusts her daily calorie level ( she 's now at 1,600 ) and provides new menus . <p> The aspect of eDiets.com that has helped Wilson the most is the 24-7 chat room . Being able to check in with someone at the very moment she 's struggling with temptation has made all the difference in her weight loss . " One night early on , I was in a chat room at midnight trying to stop myself from eating leftover pizza , " recalls Wilson . " Talking to other members about everything from celebrity gossip to shopping took my mind off food . " Wilson has augmented the member support with emails and phone calls to the Web site 's diet and fitness experts , who are available by phone 13 hours every day . <p> The greatest benefit of Wilson 's " Net loss " is her relationship with her daughters , who now want to be fit , too . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the trampoline with us ? ' and I say , ' Let 's go ! ' " the gadget gurus TABLE <p> Financial analyst Mike Turgeon was reading the Providence Journal in early 2004 when he ran across an ad looking for candidates for a weight loss study . " Even though I had never been on a diet before , the ad immediately caught my attention because at 215 pounds , I was the heaviest I 'd been in my life , " says Mike , blaming the lifestyle change that followed his marriage to Kris . Big dinners , complete with appetizer , dessert , and wine , had become a daily splurge for the couple . <p> Mike learned that the research , funded by the National Institutes of Health , would examine the use of a Palm with nutrition software , a pedometer , and a Web-based support and weight loss education program . Being a guy who loves gadgets and numbers , he signed up . <p> But a few days into the program , he quit . " The change in my diet caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , so I sent the Palm back , " he admits . Deborah Tate , PhD , lead researcher , had another thought . " She told me that if Kris purchased her own Palm , she could use the software  --  though Kris 's results could n't be counted in the final tally , " says Mike . The couple went right to an electronics store . <p> Both Kris , who weighed 210 pounds , and Mike followed the study 's strict protocol : They met with scientists who weighed them and determined their initial calorie level ( 1,600daily for Mike ; 1,500 for Kris ) . Using their Palms as food diaries , the couple recorded every morsel they ate . The software calculated the calories and grams of fat they 'd consumed and let them know what remained in their daily allowances . <p> " I could record what I ate while at a business lunch , and no one could tell what I was doing , " says Mike . Kris , who has an interior design business , adds , " When Mike came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how many calories and fat grams we had left and decide what to have for dinner . " Before bed , they entered their step counts , aiming for at least 10,000 . <p> Once a week , Mike logged on to the Internet for an expert-led chat with other study participants , with Kris by his side . The chat not only churned out practical advice  --  like what to do when you feel hungry and how to keep a healthy pantry  --  but it also gave them encouragement . " I responded so much better to this virtual discussion than I would have in a face-to-face meeting , where I 'd always feared that I was going to be lectured , " says Kris . <p> Although the study involving the Turgeons ended , they still keep their Palms within reach . " Using it does n't allow you to talk yourself into having another serving of something because you think you have calories and fat grams to spare . Plus , I 'm more likely to be honest about what I 'm eating with the Palm than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kris. the 9-to-5 snacker TABLE <p> What could be worse for an overweight person than having a desk job ? For Dana Page , it was being employed by a financial services company where food seemed to be everywhere . " There was a caf serving sandwiches , fries , and chicken fingers , and vending machines filled with candy and soda . Plus , people brought in goodies from home to share , " says Page , who gained at least 20 pounds , reaching 196 pounds , after 6 years with the company . <p> But about 2 years ago , two co-workers she enjoyed having lunch with decided that they wanted to join the Weight Watchers meetings starting in the office building . " I really did n't want to do it , " Page says . " But because I enjoyed having lunch with my friends every day , I signed up , too . " <p> In September 2003 , Page began following the Weight Watchers Flex Points plan , starting with 26 points daily . ( Each point is roughly 50 calories . ) Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brought their own lunches from home . For her , consistency helped , and she often packed the same thing : A turkey sandwich , applesauce , carrots , baked chips , and a lollipop . <p> Learning how to plan meals and snacks and how to recognize when she was full helped Page stay on track , but she also credits her colleagues ' support . " I had a group of people who were rooting for me , " she says . <p> With the group 's encouragement , Page learned to make better choices when eating out and control what she consumed at lunch by brown-bagging it and not relying on vending-machine cuisine . After about 18 months , Page reached her goal weight of 141 pounds and became a lifetime Weight Watchers member , meaning she no longer has to pay for the meetings as long as she does n't exceed her goal weight by more than 2 pounds and weighs in once a month . By April , she had lost 9 more pounds . <p> Recently Page , who is single , left her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weight Watchers group near her home in Delaware . " One of the beauties of the plan is that you can move from group to group quite easily , " she says . " Although I had some trepidation about switching groups , after attending the first few meetings , I 'm confident that I can maintain my success .
