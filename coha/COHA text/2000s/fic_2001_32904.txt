Rose Season stood at the threshold of her sister 's bedroom and silently watched the shadows of an oncoming storm stretch like plum-colored talons across the empty bed . A great gust of icy wind from Lake Michigan howled at the windows . " Merry , " she whispered with longing . Rose resisted the urge to open the window and call out to her in the vast darkness . Merry 's presence was palpable tonight . Rose had read somewhere that the spirit lingered for three days after death . Merry had been dead for four . Did she tarry to be sure her last request was honored ? Her last request Why had she agreed to it ? Rose asked herself , wringing her hands . The request was crazy , intrusive , maybe even hurtful . No one would ever go along with it . What would her sisters do when they read Merry 's letter ? Especially Jilly . She 'd never spoken of that time , not once in over twenty-five years . It was as though it had never happened . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families always had a way of coming out in the end , did n't they ? The hall clock chimed the hour . Rose tilted her head , thinking to herself that she should be calling Merry for dinner now , telling her to wash up . A pang of loneliness howled through her like the wind outside . She wandered into Merry 's lavender room , idly running her fingers along the girlish white dresser , the dainty vanity table and the silver-plated brush , comb and mirror set . Strawberry-blond hairs still clung to the bristles . Across the room , she bent to pick up the ratty red-haired baby doll lying in the center of the pristine four-posterbed.How Merry had loved the baby doll . Spring , she 'd called it , and never once in twenty-six years slept without it . Rose brought the doll to her cheek , catching Merry 's scent still lingering in the fabric . Then , with a loving pat , she placed the doll back on the bed , careful to prop it against the pillow . Rose 's hands felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with agitated strokes , then moved to the bedside stand to straighten the lace doily , adjust the pleated lampshade and line up the many small bottles of prescription drugs that she was so familiar with . She could n't part with anything of Merry 's yet , not even these useless medicines . Without Merry to take care of , she felt so useless and detached in the old house , like the shell of a cicada clinging worthlessly to the bark . She needed work to keep her going , some focus to draw her attention from her mourning . With a discipline that was the backbone of her nature , Rose walked swiftly from the gloomy bedroom to the wide , curving staircase of the old Victorian that had been her home since she was born . The walls along the stairs were covered with dozens of photographs of the Season sisters at various moments of glory and achievement in their lives . For comfort , she glanced at the familiar photographs , treasuring the faces captured in them : Jilly , Birdie , Rose and Merry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The largest numbers of photographs were of Jilly and Birdie , the eldest two . There were fewer pictures of Rose , and hardly any of Merry , the baby . She longed for her sisters ; it had been nearly ten years since they had all been together . How sad that it took a funeral to bring them together again . Who would arrive home first ? she wondered . Birdie was extremely busy with her medical practice in Wisconsin , but Jilly had the farthest to comeall the way from France . Rose paused at a framed 1978 Paris Vogue magazine cover that showcased a young Jillian at twenty-one years of age , looking sex-kittenish in a fabulous pink gown that clashed in a chic way with her vibrant red hair . It was her first cover . Rose studied her eldest sister 's full red lips pursed in an innocent pout , her deep-set eyes of emerald-green and the come-hither pose exposing one long , shimmering leg that seemed to go on forever . She could n't imagine herself ever standing in front of so many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped her photograph . For that matter , Rose could n't imagine ever looking so seductive or desirable . Jilly was born at 12:01 a.m. on November 1 , 1955 . All Souls ' Day . Mother always told of how she 'd squeezed herself shut because she did n't want a child of hers born on Halloween . Who knew what nickname father would have chosen then ? Their father , William , claimed it was a family tradition to play with their unusual last name . After all , he was nicknamed Bill Season , But their mother , Ann , a petite beauty with a will of iron , swore no child of hers was going to be tagged for life with a name people laughed at . As a compromise , Ann Season gave her daughters strong , sensible names , allowing their father full rein with the nicknames . Thus for his first daughter , Jillian , born in a Chicago autumn , he thought himself clever to name her " Jilly Season . " Moving down the stairs , Rose perused the large collection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in most things Birdie came through for the prize . " The early bird catches the worm , " their father used to say with a wink of pride at his second daughter . Birdie was his favorite , everyone knew that . Jilly would tease her and say Birdie was the son he never had . She was a tall , broad-shouldered girl with a powerful intellect and an even more powerful , competitive spirit . Even the name " Birdie " seemed to mock her tomboyish body . Bill Season had chosen the nickname because she was born in early summer and was insatiable , howling for more food like a hungry bird in the nest . And she 'd certainly caught the worms , Rose thought as her gaze wandered over the photographs . The first was Birdie at sixteen , learning into the camera , dripping wet and clutching an enormous silver trophy for the state championship swimming team . She 'd been the captain , of course . And there were more photographs , of Birdie as class valedictorian , of Birdie winning trophies for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diploma from medical school . Birdie dazzling in white lace and tulle smiling at her handsome groom , Dennis , the biggest trophy of all .
