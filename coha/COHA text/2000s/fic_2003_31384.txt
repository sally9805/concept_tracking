My bed is frigid and the room dark . I 've placed many blankets on my bed , but they do n't stop the cold Wasatch wind that penetrates to my bones . I stare through the window at my snow-covered plants and realize I will miss my garden . I will miss the way the carrots emerge from seeds not much bigger than dust . I will miss thinning beets in the late spring . I will miss digging for new potatoes in the fall . I will miss harvesting buckets of zucchini for unsuspecting neighbors who will then have no idea what to do with them ; and I will even miss watching the plants turn brown and die each year as winter sets in . My garden has taught me that every living thing must die . I have watched it happen now for scores of years  --  I only wish I could have a few more summers in my garden with Emily . I have other grandchildren , and I do n't mean to play favorites , but the others live far away and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though our ages are more than seven decades apart , Emily and I are best friends . My name is Harry , a laughable name for a man who 's been completely bald most of his life . But , hairy or not , it 's my name nonetheless . It was my father 's name before me , and his father 's before him . I wish I could say it was a name I passed on to my own son . I ca n't . When he was born and it came time to give him a name , we chose Bob instead . He rarely visits ; he never writes . Now , on occasion , I wish I 'd named him Harry as well . Strangely , I 'm not bitter about what is happening to me . Why should I be ? I am no better than anyone else . I am no wiser , no stronger , and no smarter . ( Okay , I am smarter than ol ' man Ross who lives next door but that 's beside the point . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go quickly so I 'll be remembered as Grandpa Harry and not as the person I 'm becoming . I fear I 'll be remembered as a contemptible , cranky old man and that thought sickens me . The fact is , I 'm losing my mind . I have Alzheimer 's  --  an insidious disease that causes the nerve cells in the brain to degenerate . As it works its havoc , the brain shrinks and wastes away  --  dementia sets in , causing disorientation and confusion . There is no cure , no way to slow its determined progression . This disease is a thief . It begins with short spells of forgetfulness , but before it 's finished , it steals everything . It takes your favorite color , the smell of your favorite food , the night of your first kiss , your love of golf . Droplets of shimmering water cleansing the earth during an invigorating spring shower simply become rain . Mammoth snowflakes blanketing the ground in white at the onset of winter 's first storm merely seem cold . Your heart beats , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but inside you are dead . Inside your spirit is gone . I say it is an insidious disease because in the end , it steals your existence  --  even your very soul . In the end I will forget Emily . The disease is progressing , and even now people are beginning to laugh . I do not hate them for it ; they laugh with good reason . I would laugh as well at the stupid things I do . Two days ago I peed in the driveway in my front yard . I had to go and at the time it seemed like a great spot . A week before , I woke up in the middle of the night , walked into the kitchen , and tried to gargle with the dishwashing liquid that is kept in the cupboard beneath the sink . I thought I was in the bathroom , and the green liquid was the same color as my mouthwash . I get nervous . I get scared , and I cry ; I cry like a baby over the most ridiculous things . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times when I can still think clearly , but each day I feel my good time fading  --  my existence getting shorter . During my good spells , now just an hour or two a day , I sit at my desk and I write . I crouch over the keyboard on my computer and I punch the keys wildly . It 's an older computer , but it serves its purpose well . It 's the best gift Bob has given me in years . It 's an amazing machine and every time I use it , I marvel at how it captures my words . Younger people who have grown up with computers around them do n't appreciate the truly miraculous machines they are . They create magic . I 'm not a good writer , but I 've loved writing stories and poems all of my life . Writing always made me feel immortal  --  as if I were creating an extension of my life that nothing could destroy . It was exhilarating . I no longer write for excitement . There are times when my back aches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fingers to hit the right keys , but I continue . I write now for Emily . She is just seven years old . I doubt she 'll remember my face ; I doubt she 'll remember the crooked fingers on my wrinkled hands or the age spots on my skin or my shiny , bald head . But hopefully , by some miracle , she will read my stories and my poems and she 'll remember my heart , and consider me as her friend . That is my deepest desire . At times I feel bad that I 'm not writing to my other grandchildren , but I hardly know them . While they visit every Christmas , they do n't stay long . They are courteous , but they treat me like a stranger . It 's not their fault . I 'm not angry with them , and I hope they are n't angry with me . My worst fear is that before I finish , I will slip completely into the grasp of the terrible monster , never to return . If this happens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but they will not forget  --  and then , worse than being forgotten , I will be remembered as a different person than I truly am . I will be despised . I vow not to let this happen , so during my good times , I write  --  I write for Emily .
