<p> What are we to learn from the tragedy of Nikko Briteramos " Chicagoan sparks S. Dakota AIDS panic , " news story , April 27 ? As you may recall , Nikko is the 18-year-old South Dakota college student facing prosecution for allegedly having sex with his girlfriend without disclosing his HIV status . It 's tempting to brand Nikko an irresponsible menace , as the mainstream media have done , and imagine we 've learned all we need to know . But as we renew our commitment to contain the AIDS epidemic , we must understand the important lessons that may have been overlooked . <p> The first obvious lesson is that HIV is everywhere . It does n't stop at state borders or ivy-covered college gates . HIV does n't happen only to gay men , only to drug users , only to people in big cities , or only to people over 18 . <p> Just as real , and no less important , is the lesson that the HIV epidemic has been fueled by unprotected sex , and that our sexual partners either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with us if they do . But what other lessons might we be missing in our rush to conclusions about what this tragedy means ? <p> We have put enormous effort into a public health system that encourages people to get tested for HIV . Every time someone takes an HIV test , it gives us a chance to educate them about the disease , engage them in a discussion of their individual risks and discuss HIV prevention . If they test HIV positive , it gives us the opportunity to link them to health care and provide their partners with testing and prevention information . But these critically important opportunities are all lost if people are unwilling to be tested . <p> Now consider the lessons that Nikko 's experience may teach us about HIV testing . Nikko learned his status , cooperated with public health officials and honestly named his sexual partners . He was immediately arrested , imprisoned and branded a murderer on national television . Surely , many other young people at risk for HIV saw what happened to Nikko . Will they rush to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Or will they decide that the burdens of knowing their HIV status are so great and the risks of public vilification so high that only a fool would want to know his status ? <p> Finally , what lessons might Nikko 's experience teach people with HIV about cooperating with public health agencies on issues of partner notification and prevention ? If you have HIV , how can you now feel safe identifying your partners or discussing your sexual or drug habits with a public health worker , when you fear that worker may turn this information  --  and you  --  over to the police ? <p> Effective HIV prevention , for the millions of people at risk , of all ages , all over the country , demands that we have a public health system people trust  --  not one they fear . Unfortunately , Nikko 's experience teaches exactly the wrong lesson . It teaches those at risk , particularly young men , that perhaps they would be prudent to avoid learning their HIV status , and wise to stay as far away from the public health system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move quickly to restore trust in our public health systems . Public health officials in Chicago and elsewhere must act immediately to convince communities at risk that they are not handmaidens of the criminal justice system . Without those changes , this tragedy can only be a step backward in the fight against HIV . <p> Ann Hilton Fisher , executive director , <p> AIDS Legal Council of Chicago <p> In the last few days , I have had several close encounters with motorists who have given new meaning to the term " aggressive . " I have nearly been sideswiped by a driver who did n't bother to look when he decided he wanted the lane I was in . I have been passed by another driver who drove on the left shoulder of Route 41 . And I have nearly been in a collision when someone who found 1 cubic inch between my car and the car ahead of me decided he wanted to get ahead of me . <p> And yet police are going to be more concerned whether or not I 'm wearing my seat belt during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after something as ridiculous as seat belt use , police could write a year 's worth of tickets in one day by going after the real hazard on the road . <p> Regarding Tom Pierce 's letter May 7 about how " ordinary people " will be inconvenienced by having their vehicles confiscated because their licenses were suspended : Too bad ! It 's bad enough that people who drive without a license in most cases do not have insurance , so if they do get in an accident , " ordinary people " who are responsible enough to abide by the law have to carry " uninsured motorist " coverage to pay for your irresponsibilities . It has been a long time coming that something should be done about this . This might make the next driver think before they speed or drive while under the influence . <p> I also applaud loudly the Sun-Times for bringing this to the attention of us " ordinary people , " judges , police and legislators who observe the laws and are thankful for the privilege of driving . <p> B. Tiemens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-part series " Evolution " starting May 14 . This series is intended to sell Darwin 's theory of evolution , not to present good science . It amounts to a propaganda film for the doctrine of naturalism , which holds that life , including humans , is just an accidental byproduct of a purposeless , random process . <p> The first misrepresentation is in the title itself . Evolution is true in the very limited sense that species can change within certain narrow limits in response to environmental changes . There is little evidence for the claim that all life descended from a common ancestor through chance mutations and natural selection . <p> The producers of the show portray opposition to Darwin 's theory as coming from a group of scientifically illiterate fundamentalists who want to force everyone to accept the creation account in Genesis . Nothing could be further from the truth . The show wo n't tell you about the intelligent design theory , which is based on evidence showing that natural selection is inadequate to produce the " irreducibly complex " molecular machinery of cells or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Far from being raving fanatics , the intelligent design theorists are published , peer-reviewed biochemists and mathematicians . <p> Mike Baughman , Forest Park <p> Julian Russell of Charleston got it absolutely correct in his May 12 letter , " Old enough to vote . " As teens approaching adulthood , we have a particular responsibility to make civic participation just as imperative as our elders . <p> However , we as competent youth do n't need any prominent political figure to dictate to us what causes we should try to advance . Youth empowerment will flourish only if we ourselves plant the seed and nourish the soil . <p> I too want to see the voting age lowered so that teens are allowed vote . After all , voting is the most cherished constitutional right ! <p> Haamid Xavier Johnson , <p> Roseland <p> I do n't know what the big deal is about opening up Cuba to American trade again . If my memory serves me correctly , did n't Fidel Castro confiscate or nationalize all the property that belonged to people when he took power and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and invest in Cuba again , what 's stopping him from confiscating everything again ? <p> Reginald E. Johnson , <p> South Shore <p> For the City of Chicago to ask some city employees to work a few days with no pay because of a budget crunch , then for aldermen who are already making $85,000 a year , plus perks and benefits , to request a pay raise is outrageous ! Last time I checked , you can live pretty well on $85,000 . <p> There 's plenty of money in this city , and it 's not being spread around enough . Take cabdrivers . Cabdrivers routinely work 12-hour shifts . Unlike Chicago Transit Authority employees , cabbies get no salary , no wages , no medical , no dental , no optical , no sick days , no paid vacations , no paid personal days , no guarantee how much they will make in a given day , week , month or year . And no foreknowledge of when the leases or gas prices will go up . <p> Since Sept. 11 , some days cabbies have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lease and gas for 12 hours ' work . This , too , is outrageous ! There 's plenty of money floating around out there , and it needs to be sent to the people who need it most for the basics of survival ( the poor and working class ) before it 's sent to people who are already doing well . No pay raise for the aldermen ! <p> Rick Soderquist , Lake View <p> To the feuding white and black descendants of Thomas Jefferson " Jefferson group rejects descendants of slave , " news story , May 6 : How is it that you are so special that you should have your own club ? Do you think that because you have inherited a tiny speck of DNA from a great person who lived 200 years ago , somehow his genius is reflected in each of you ? <p> Jefferson 's greatness derives from what he accomplished through his own genius and initiative  --  not from his ancestors . <p> In the meantime , come join the rest of us peons who do n't know or care who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagree with the proposed aldermanic pay raise should vote against any alderman who votes for the proposal . For a part-time job , $85,000 is fairly substantial . <p> We might also adopt a strategy often used in the private sector : Allow a pay raise if a corresponding percentage of seats are eliminated . A 10 percent raise would require five fewer alderman . <p> Would we really miss them ? <p> John Morris , Near North Side <p> What an outrage that Ald. Ed Burke has the nerve not to step down now that his ward is majority Hispanic Juan Andrade column , May 3 . Even worse , he had the nerve to become alderman of the 14th Ward when it was majority Polish and Lithuanian . <p> In fact , the 14th Ward never had a huge Irish population . Burke must have committed a crime against humanity . There should be an investigation , led by Andrade  --  that is , if he is n't too busy writing columns that insult the very people he claims to be fighting for . <p> John Gorman , <p> @ @
