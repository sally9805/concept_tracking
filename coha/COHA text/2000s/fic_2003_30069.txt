Another journey west , Bold and Psin find an empty land ; Temur is displeased , and the chapter has a stormy end . Monkey never dies . He keeps coming back to help us in times of trouble , just as he helped Tripitaka through the dangers of the first journey to the west , to bring Buddhism from India to China . Now he had taken on the form of a small Mongol named Bold Bardash , horseman in the army of Temur the Lame . Son of a Tibetan salt trader and a Mongol innkeeper and spirit woman , and thus a traveler from before the day of his birth , up and down and back and forth , over mountains and rivers , across deserts and steppes , crisscrossing always the heartland of the world . At the time of our story he was already old : square face , bent nose , gray plaited hair , four chin whiskers for a beard . He knew this would be Temur 's last campaign , and wondered if it would be his too . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them rode out of dark hills at dusk . Bold was getting skittish at the quiet . Of course it was not truly quiet , forests were always noisy compared to the steppe ; there was a big river ahead , spilling its sounds through the wind in the trees ; but something was missing . Birdsong perhaps , or some other sound Bold could not quite identify . The horses snickered as the men kneed them on . It did not help that the weather was changing , long mare 's tails wisping orange in the highest part of the sky , wind gusting up , air dampa storm rolling in from the west . Under the big sky of the steppe it would have been obvious . Here in the forested hills there was less sky to be seen , and the winds were fluky , but the signs were stillthere . They ride by fields that lay rank with unharvested crops . Barley fallen over itself , Apple trees with apples dry in the branches , Or black on the ground . No cart tracks or hoofprints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets , The gibbous moon misshapen overhead . Owl dips over field . A sudden gust : How big the world seems in a wind . Horses are tense , Monkey too . They came to an empty bridge and crossed it , hooves thwocking the planks . Now they came on some wooden buildings with thatched roofs . But no fires , no lantern light . They moved on . More buildings appeared through the trees , but still no people . The dark land was empty . Psin urged them on , and more buildings stood on each side of the widening road . They followed a turn out of the hills onto a plain , and before them lay a black silent city . No lights , no voices ; only the wind , rubbing branches together over sheeting surfaces of the big black flowing river . The city was empty . Of course we are reborn many times . We fill our bodies like air in bubbles , and when the bubbles pop we puff away into the bardo , wandering until we are blown into some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge had often been a comfort to Bold as he stumbled exhausted over battlefields in the aftermath , the ground littered with broken bodies like empty coats . But it was different to come on a town where there had been no battle , and find everyone there already dead . Long dead ; bodies dried ; in the dusk and moonlight they could see the gleam of exposed bones , scattered by wolves and crows . Bold repeated the Heart Sutra to himself . " Form is emptiness , emptiness form . Gone , gone , gone beyond , gone altogether beyond . O , what an Awakening ! All hail ! " The horses stalled on the outskirts of the town . Aside from the cluck and hiss of the river , all was still . The squinted eye of the moon gleamed on dressed stone , there in the middle of all the wooden buildings . A very big stone building , among smaller stone buildings . Psin ordered them to put clothes over their faces , to avoid touching anything , to stay on their horses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground with their hooves . Slowly they rode through narrow streets , walled by wooden buildings two or three stories high , leaning together as in Chinese cities . The horses were unhappy but did not refuse outright . They came into a paved central square near the river , and stopped before the great stone building . It was huge . Many of the local people had come to it to die . Their lamasery , no doubt , but roofless , open to the skyunfinished business . As if these people had only come to religion in their last days ; but too late ; the place was a boneyard . Gone , gone , gone beyond , gone altogether beyond . Nothing moved , and it occurred to Bold that the pass in the mountains they had ridden through had perhaps been the wrong one , the one to that other west which is the land of the dead . For an instant he remembered something , a brief glimpse of another lifea town much smaller than this one , a village wiped out by some great rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . Hours in a room , waiting for death ; this was why he so often felt he recognized the people he met . Their existences were a shared fate . " Plague , " Psin said . " Let 's get out of here . " His eyes glinted as he looked at Bold , his face was hard ; he looked like one of the stone officers in the imperial tombs . Bold shuddered . " I wonder why they did n't leave , " he said . " Maybe there was nowhere to go . " Plague had struck in India a few years before . Mongols rarely caught it , only a baby now and then . Turks and Indians were more susceptible , and of course Temur had all kinds in his army , Persians , Turks , Mongols , Tibetans , Indians , Tajiks , Arabs , Georgians . Plague could kill them , any of them , or all of them . If that was truly what had felled these people . There was no way to be sure . " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The others nodded , pleased that it was Psin 's decision . Temur had told them to scout the Magyar plain and what lay beyond , west for four days ' ride . He did n't like it when scouting detachments returned without fulfilling orders , even if they were composed of his oldest qa'uchin . But Psin could face him . Back through moonlight they rode , camping briefly when the horses got tired . On again at dawn , back through the broad gap in the mountains the earlier scouts had called the Moravian Gate . No smoke from any village or hut they passed . They kicked the horses to their fastest long trot , rode hard all that day . As they came down the long eastern slope of the range back onto the steppe , an enormous wall of cloud reared up in the western half of the sky . Like Kali 's black blanket pulling over them , The Goddess of Death chasing them out of her land . Solid black underside fluted and rippled , Black pigs ' tails and fishhooks swirling into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heads , The men can no longer look at each other . They approached Temur 's great encampment , and the black stormcloud covered the rest of the day , causing a darkness like night . Hair rose on the back of Bold 's neck . A few huge raindrops splashed down , and thunder rolled out of the west like giant iron cartwheels overhead . They hunkered down in their saddles and kicked the horses on , reluctant to return in such a storm , with such news . Temur would take it as a portent , just as they did . Temur often said that he owed all his success to an asura that visited him and gave him guidance . Bold had witnessed one of these visitations , had seen Temur engage in conversation with an invisible being , and afterward tell people what they were thinking and what would happen to them . A cloud this black could only be a sign . Evil in the west . Something bad had happened back there , something worse even than plague , maybe , and Temur 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be abandoned ; he had been beaten to it by the goddess of skulls herself . It was hard to imagine him accepting any such preemption , but there they were , under a storm like none of them had ever seen , and all the Magyars were dead . Smoke rose from the vast camp 's cooking fires , looking like a great sacrifice , the smell familiar and yet distant , as if from a home they had already left forever . Psin looked at the men around him . " Camp here , " he ordered . He thought things over . " Bold . " Bold felt the fear shoot through him . " Come on . " Bold swallowed and nodded . He was not courageous , but he had the stoic manner of the qa'uchin , Temur 's oldest warriors . Psin also would know that Bold was aware they had entered a different realm , that everything that happened from this point onward was freakish , something preordained and being lived through inexorably , a karma they could not escape . Psin also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the two of them had been captured by a tribe of taiga hunters north of the Kama River . Together they had staged a very successful escape , knifing the hunters ' headman and running through a bonfire into the night . The two men rode by the outer sentries and through the camp to the khan 's tent . To the west and north lightning bolts crazed the black air . Neither man had seen such a storm in all their lives . The few little hairs on Bold 's forearms stood up like pig bristles , and he felt the air crackling with hungry ghosts , pretas crowding in to witness Temur emerge from his tent . He had killed so many . The two men dismounted and stood there . Guards came out of the tent , drawing aside the flaps of the doorway and standing at attention , ready with drawn bows . Bold 's throat was too dry to swallow , and it seemed to him a blue light glowed from within the great yurt of the khan . Temur appeared high in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hefted on their shoulders . He was pale-faced and sweating , the whites of his eyes visible all the way around . He stared down at Psin . " Why are you back ? " " Khan , a plague has struck the Magyars . They 're all dead . " Temur regarded his unloved general . " Why are you back ? " " To tell you , Khan . " Psin 's voice was steady , and he met Temur 's fierce gaze without fear . But Temur was not pleased . Bold swallowed ; nothing here was the same as that time he and Psin had escaped the hunters , there was n't a single feature of that effort that could be repeated . Only the idea that they could do it remained . Something inside Temur snapped , Bold saw ithis asura was speaking through him now , and it looked like it was wreaking great harm in him as it did . Not an asura , perhaps , but his nafs , the spirit animal that lived inside him . He rasped , " They can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer for this , no matter how they try to escape . " He waved an arm weakly . " Go back to your detachment . " Then to his guards he said in a calmer voice , " Take these two back and kill them and their men , and their horses . Make a bonfire and burn everything . Then move our camp two days ' ride east . " He raised up his hand . The world burst asunder . A bolt of lightning had exploded among them . Bold sat deaf on the ground . Looking around stunned , he saw that all the others there had been flattened as well , that the khan 's tent was burning , Temur 's litter tipped over , his carriers scrambling , the khan himself on one knee , clutching his chest . Some of his men rushed to him . Again lightning blasted down among them . Blindly Bold picked himself up and fled . He looked over his shoulder through pulsing green afterimages , and saw Temur 's black nafs fly out of his mouth into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asura and nafs both . The emptied body collapsed to the ground , and rain bucketed onto it . Bold ran into the dark to the west . We do not know which way Psin went , or what happened to him ; but as for Bold , you can find out in the next chapter . Chapter 2 Through the realm of hungry ghosts A monkey wanders , lonely as a cloud . Bold ran or walked west all that night , scrambling through the growing forest in the pouring rain , climbing into the steepest hills he could find , to evade any horsemen who might follow . No one would be too zealous in pursuit of a potential plague carrier , but he could be shot down from a good distance away , and he wanted to disappear from their world as if he had never existed . If it had not been for the uncanny storm he would certainly be dead , already embarked on another existence : now he was anyway . Gone , gone , gone beyond , gone altogether beyond . . . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dawn of the second day found him hurrying back through the Moravian Gate , feeling that no one would dare follow him there . Once onto the Magyar plain he headed south , into trees . In the morning 's wet light he found a fallen tree and slipped deep under its exposed roots , to sleep for the rest of the day in hidden dryness . That night the rain stopped , and on the third morning he emerged ravenous . In short order he found , pulled , and ate meadow onions , then hunted for more substantial food . It was possible that dried meat still hung in the empty villages ' storehouses , or grain in their granaries . He might also be able to find a bow and some arrows . He did n't want to go near the dead settlements , but it seemed the best way to find food , and that took precedence over everything else . That night he slept poorly , his stomach full and gassy with onions . At dawn he made his way south , following the big river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people he saw were dead on the ground . It was disturbing , but there was nothing to be done . He too was in some kind of posthumous existence , a very hungry ghost indeed . Living on from one found bite to the next , with no name or fellows , he began to close in on himself , as during the hardest campaigns on the steppes , becoming more and more an animal , his mind shrinking in like the horns of a touched snail . For many watches at a time he thought little but the Heart Sutra . Form is emptiness , emptiness form . Not for nothing had he been named Sun Wu-kong , Awake to Emptiness , in an earlier incarnation . Monkey in the void .
