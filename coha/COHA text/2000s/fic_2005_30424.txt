Jonathan Stride felt like a ghost , bathed in the white spotlights that illuminated the bridge . Below him , muddy brown swells flooded into the canal , spewing waves over the concrete piers and swallowing the spray in eight-foot troughs . The water tumbled over itself , squeezing from the violent lake to the placid inner harbor . At the end of the piers , where ships navigated the canal as delicately as thread through a needle , twin lighthouses flashed revolving beams of green and red . The bridge felt like a living thing . As cars sped onto the platform , a whine filled the air , like the buzz of hornets . The honeycomb sidewalk vibrated , quivering under his feet . Stride glanced upward , as he imagined Rachel would have done , at the crisscross scissors of steel towering above his head . The barely perceptible sway unsettled him and made him dizzy . He was doing what he always did -- putting himself inside the mind of the victim , seeing the world through her eyes . Rachel had been here on Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one knew . Stride turned his attention to the two teenagers who stood with him , impatiently stamping their feet against the cold . " Where was she when you first saw her ? " he asked . The boy , Kevin Lowry , extracted a beefy hand from his pocket . His third finger sported an oversized onyx high school ring . He tapped the three inches of wet steel railing . " Right here , Lieutenant . She was balanced on top of the railing . Arms stretched out . Sort of like Christ . " He closed his eyes , tilted his chin toward heaven , and extended his arms with his palms upward . " Like this . " Stride frowned . It had been a bleak October , with angry swoops of wind and sleet raining likebullets from the night sky . He could n't imagine anyone climbing on top of the railing that night without falling . Kevin seemed to read his mind . " She was really graceful . Like a dancer . " Stride peered over the railing . The narrow canal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down with bellies of iron ore . It could suck a body down in its wicked undertow and not let go . " What the hell was she doing up there ? " Stride asked . The other teenager , Sally Lindner , spoke for the first time . Her voice was crabbed . " It was a stunt , like everything else she did . She wanted attention . " Kevin opened his mouth to complain but closed it again . Stride got the feeling this was an old argument between them . He noticed that Sally had her arm slung through Kevin 's , and she tugged the boy a little closer when she talked . " So what did you do ? " Stride asked . " I ran up here on the bridge , " Kevin said . " I helped her down . " Stride watched Sally 's mouth pucker unhappily as Kevin described the rescue . " Tell me about Rachel , " Stride said to Kevin . " We grew up together . Next-door neighbors . Then her mom married Mr. Stoner and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Well , uh , pretty , " Kevin said nervously , shooting a quick glance at Sally . Sally rolled her eyes . " She was beautiful , okay ? Long black hair . Slim , tall . The whole package . And a bigger slut you 're not likely to find . " " Sally ! " Kevin protested . " It 's true , and you know it . After Friday ? You know it . " Sally turned her face away from Kevin , although she did n't let go of his arm . Stride watched the girl 's jaw set in an angry line , her lips pinched together . Sally had a rounded face , with a messy pile of chestnut curls tumbling to her shoulders and blowing across her flushed cheeks . In her tight blue jeans and red parka , she was a pretty young girl . But no one would describe her as beautiful . Not a stunner . Not like Rachel . " What happened on Friday ? " Stride asked . He knew what Deputy Chief Kinnick had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been home since Friday . She was missing . Gone . Just like Kerry . " Well , she sort of came on to me , " Kevin said grudgingly . " Right in front of me ! " Sally snapped . " Fucking bitch . " Kevin 's eyebrows furled together like a yellow caterpillar . " Stop it . Do n't talk about her like that . " Stride held up one hand , silencing the argument . He reached inside his faded leather jacket and pulled out a pack of cigarettes that he had wedged into the pocket of his flannel shirt . He studied the pack with weary disgust , then lit a cigarette and took a long drag . Smoke curled out of his mouth and formed a cloud in front of his face . He felt his lungs contract . Stride tossed the rest of the pack into the canal , where the red package swirled like a dot of blood and then was swept under the bridge . " Back up , " he said . " Kevin , give me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kevin rubbed his hand across his scalp until his blond hair stood up like naked winter trees . He squared his shoulders , which were broad and muscular . A football player . " Rachel called me on my cell phone on Friday night and said we should come hang out with her in Canal Park , " Kevin said . " It was about eight-thirty , I guess . A shitty night . The park was almost empty . When we spotted Rachel , she was on the railing , playing around . So we ran up on the bridge to get her off there . " " Then what ? " Stride asked . Kevin pointed to the opposite side of the bridge , to the peninsula that stretched like a narrow finger with Lake Superior on one side and Duluth harbor on the other . Stride had lived there most of his life , watching the ore ships shoulder out to sea . " The three of us wandered down to the beach . We talked about school stuff . " " She 's a suck-up , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the teacher 's theories on screwed-up families . She takes English , and the teacher 's poetry is so wonderful . She takes math and grades papers after school . " Stride silenced the girl with a stony stare . Sally pouted and tossed her hair defiantly . Stride nodded at Kevin to continue . " Then we heard a ship 's horn , " he said . " Rachel said she wanted to ride the bridge while it went up . " " They do n't let you do that , " Stride said . " Yeah , but Rachel knows the bridge keeper . She and her dad used to hang out with him . " " Her dad ? You mean Graeme Stoner ? " Kevin shook his head . " No , her real dad . Tommy . " Stride nodded . " Go on . " " Well , we went back on the bridge , but Sally did n't want to do it . She kept going to the city side . But I did n't want Rachel up there by herself , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she started making out with me . " " She was playing games with you , " Sally said sharply . Kevin shrugged . Stride watched Kevin tug at the collar around his thick neck and then caught a glimpse of the boy 's eyes . Kevin was n't going to say exactly what happened on the bridge , but he clearly was embarrassed and aroused thinking about it . " We were n't up there very long , " Kevin said . " Maybe ten minutes . When we got down , Sally -- she was n't ... " " I left , " Sally said . " I went home . " Kevin stuttered on his words . " I 'm really sorry , Sal . " He reached out a hand to brush her hair , but Sally twisted away . Before Stride could cut short the latest spat , he heard his cell phone burping out a polyphonic rendition of Alan Jackson 's " Chattahoochee . " He dug the phone out of his pocket and recognized the number for Maggie Bei . He flipped it open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss . The media 's got the story . They 're crawling all over us . " Stride scowled . " Shit . " He took a few steps away from the two teenagers , noting that Sally began hissing at Kevin as soon as Stride was out of earshot . " Is Bird out there with the other jackals ? " he asked . " Oh , yeah . Leading the inquisition . " " Well , for God 's sake , do n't talk to him . Do n't let any reporters near the Stoners . " " No problem , we 're taped off . " " Any other good news ? " Stride asked . " They 're playing it like this is number two , " Maggie told him . " First Kerry , now Rachel . " " That figures . Well , I do n't like dj vu either . Look , I 'll be there in twenty minutes , okay ? " Stride slapped the phone shut . He was impatient now . Things were already moving in a direction he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed the nature of the investigation . He needed the TV and newspapers to get the girl 's face in front of the public , but Stride wanted to control the story , not have the story control him . That was impossible with Bird Finch asking questions . " Keep going , " Stride urged Kevin . " There 's not much else , " Kevin said . " Rachel said she was tired and wanted to go home . So I walked her to the Blood Bug . " " The what ? " Stride asked . " Sorry . Rachel 's car . A VW Beetle , okay ? She called it the Blood Bug . " " Why ? " Kevin 's face was blank . " Because it was red , I guess . " " Okay . You actually saw her drive off ? " " Yes . " " Alone ? " " Sure . " " And she specifically told you she was going home ? " " That 's what she said . " " Could she have been lying ? Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sure she could . Probably did . " Stride turned his dark eyes on Sally again . She hooded her eyes and looked down at her shoes , her curls falling over her forehead . " Do you know something , Sally ? " Stride asked . " Did you maybe go see Rachel and tell her to lay off Kevin here ? " " No ! " " Then who do you think Rachel would have gone to see ? " " It could have been anyone , " Sally said . " She was a whore . " " Stop it ! " Kevin insisted . " Both of you stop it , " Stride snapped . " What was Rachel wearing that night ? " " Tight black jeans , the kind you need a knife to cut yourself out of , " Sally replied . " And a white turtleneck . " " Kevin , did you see anything in her car ? Luggage ? A backpack ? " " No , nothing like that . " " You told Mr. Stoner that she made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She asked if I wanted to see her on Saturday night . She said I could pick her up at seven , and we could go out . But she was n't there . " " It was a game to her , " Sally repeated . " Did she tell you to call me on Saturday and lie to me ? Because that 's what you did . " Stride knew he was n't going to get any more out of these two tonight . " Listen up , both of you . This is n't about who kissed who . A girl 's missing . A friend of yours . I 've got to go talk to her parents , who are wondering if they 're ever going to see their daughter again , okay ? So think . Is there anything else you remember from Friday night ? Anything Rachel did or said ? Anything that might tell us where she went when she left here or who she might have seen . " Kevin closed his eyes , as if he were really trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sally was sullen , and Stride wondered if she was hiding something . But she was n't going to talk . " I have no idea what happened to her , " Sally mumbled . Stride nodded . " All right , we 'll be in touch . " He took another glance out at the looming blackness of the lake , beyond the narrow canal . There was nothing to see . It was as empty and hollow as his world felt now . As he pushed past the two teenagers and headed to the parking lot , he felt it again . Dj vu . It was an ugly memory .
