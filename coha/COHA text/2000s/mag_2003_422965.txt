Section : FEATURE LIVING WELL Mystery surrounds our daily bread  --  more than we really know . In fact , it may be the key to our emotional , mental and physical longevity . <p> FOOD IS GLORIOUS . IT feeds us in every way  --  not only physically but emotionally . Just take a tour of the Food Network . Food elicits all sorts of emotions : The exciting , " bam , " Emeril . Nigella bites , with passion . The winking Naked Chef . And mystery when east meets west with Ming . <p> But food is more than just delectable and sustaining . It can actually heal us . Nutrients fight diseases of the heart , help prevent cancer and even keep the brain sharp . <p> " Food has health benefits beyond basic nutrition " says Cheryl Toner , M.S. , R.D. , director of health communications at the International Food and Information Council Foundation ( IFIC ) . We know fruits and vegetables have vitamins and that unprocessed foods are best , but what do whole grains , fruits and vegetables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat are a power source that helps our bodies resist disease as well as prolong cognitive function and improve mood . <p> Remember when you ate berries for vitamin C ? Today , studies suggest that berries also contain antioxidants that fight cell damage . Indeed , the growing popularity of alternative health is putting a spotlight on food , pushing people to look beyond traditional medicine for answers on how to cure and prevent disease . Good food , combined with exercise , may be just the ingredient for a healthy mind and body . By taking control of your health , you will even lift your mood . <p> According to the IFIC , most Americans believe that they have at least moderate control over their health and that nutrition plays a role even more significant than exercise and family-health history . " Foods for treatment and prevention of disease is an exploding area , " says Andrew Weil , M.D. , director of integrative medicine at the University of Arizona , in Tucson . " Any medical journal shows how groups of foods or food components affect health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' magical powers , it was likely linked to antioxidants . They neutralize cell-damaging agents and possibly reduce your risk of disease . Antioxidants occur naturally in foods of various types such as fruits , vegetables , nuts , fish oil , tea and numerous others . <p> Still , " there is some excessive Hype , " says Walter Willett , M.D. , Dr.P.H. , Harvard School of Public Health nutrition department chair . Antioxidants are n't a cure-all . " However , we are learning that foods have many more important functions than we had recognized earlier . For example , polyunsaturated fats do much more than lower blood cholesterol levels . They can help prevent blood clots and lower the odds of developing fatal heart rhythms . " <p> The role of essential fatty acids is another huge area of research . Says Weil , " They improve mental function and protect against heart disease and inflammation . The average American diet is seriously deficient in omega-3 fatty acids , and that has health consequences , " Good sources for omega-3s include fish , certain seeds and walnuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soy and whole grains are also recommended as part of an optimal diet . These contain phytochemicals , natural agents which help strengthen the immune system and protect against disease . <p> Phytochemicals are found in foods such as garlic , legumes and nuts , among many others . " Fruits and vegetables do n't contain disease-promoting substances ; they contain thousands of protective substances , " says book author Dean Ornish , M.D. , president and director of the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute in Sausalito , California . " It 's not just what you exclude from your diet , it 's what you include that 's important . " <p> Learning about foods is only part of the goal . To live a healthier life , you may need to change your ways . Shopping for , preparing and eating foods differently may be in order . Making the switch from chips to veggies is n't easy , so how do we find the motivation ? <p> For one thing , using the fear of death to motivate people does n't work , says Ornish . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifestyle , you start to feel better . You have more energy , you think more clearly , your brain and heart get more blood , you do n't need as much sleep and you have more stamina . " <p> New information surfaces continually , so it can get confusing . To decide what makes sense for you , read , consult your doctor or nutritionist and explore new foods . " Try making changes even if it 's just for a week . You 'll learn from experience how much better you feel . It 's a much more organic way of changing , " says Ornish . And , as Willett notes , " Decisions about eating should n't be made on the basis of a single study ; confirmation from various reputable sources is important . " That 's why PT has put together some of the most recent findings . From ginko to omega-3s , here are some studies that show the benefits . HEART <p> To protect your heart , you already know that you need to exercise and eat a diet low in saturated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not have considered . Soy , for one , is believed to reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering cholesterol . Many experts recommend 25 grams of soy protein a day . A study published recently in Diabetes Care shows that soy may help reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes in postmenopausal women because it contains the antioxidant isoflavones . You can get soy in many forms : edamame ( steamed soybeans ) , tofu and soynuts , for example . <p> Nuts also have heart-healthy effects , although they were once feared because of their high-fat content . But the Harvard Nurses ' Health Study found that women who ate an ounce of nuts at least five times a week for 14 years lowered their risk of heart disease by about 30 percent . <p> Nuts have monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats , and according to the IFIC , individuals with diets high in these fats enjoy lower levels of bad cholesterol . Saturated fats , on the contrary , increase " bad , " low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol . Other foods high in healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Omega-3 fatty acids are an equally important fat component that is found in abundance in oily fish such as salmon and mackerel , and to a lesser extent in other forms of seafood . These fatty acids help maintain and repair brain cells , which are made of fat . They also reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease , stroke and cancer . A study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that sudden cardiac deaths occur less frequently in those who eat ocean fish . <p> When listing heart-healthy ingredients , do n't forget wine and beer . We all know that moderate alcohol consumption can help prevent heart disease , but the latest research indicates that how often you drink may be more important than how much or what you drink . A recent study from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston reported that people who drink alcohol at least three times a week are less likely to develop heart disease than are nondrinkers and less-frequent drinkers  --  regardless of what is preferred : beer , wine or spirits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Clinical Nutrition , Dutch researchers studied beer-drinking with dinner . In the study of middle-age adults , levels of C-reactive protein , a compound associated with inflammation and blood clots , declined . <p> Indeed , wine , soy , nuts and fish are well-known for their heart-healthy benefits . But here are some surprising additions : Honey and chocolate , and the darker the better . Apparently , honey has the same heart-healthy , plaque-fighting antioxidants found in foods such as spinach and apples . At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign , a five-week study of men between ages 18 and 68 found that antioxidant levels in their blood increased after drinking water with honey . <p> Chocolate helps your heart as well . Its flavonoids , a family of antioxidants , help the body resist cell damage from free radicals . And , in turn , the sweet may decrease your risk for stroke and heart disease . MEMORY <p> Exercising your brain with crossword puzzles may help keep your thinking cap in order , but studies show that what you eat helps as well . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects . According to the Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University , cranberries help protect the brain from neurological damage . <p> Certain foods can also prevent other cognitive-related problems . Linoleic acid is nutritionally essential . It can be found in seed oils such as safflower and sunflower and , according to a Loyola University Medical Center study , may help control hypertension and thus prevent stroke , the nation 's third-leading killer . <p> Equally important is what you drink . According to a recent study published in Neurology , people who drink wine moderately have a lower risk of developing dementia , including Alzheimer 's disease . Red wine is especially favorable because it is high in flavonoids . On the other hand , the study also found that occasional beer drinking was associated with an increased risk of developing dementia . <p> And antioxidants , of course , are important in maintaining cognitive ability . These disease-fighting agents came into play once again in two recent studies published in the Journal of the American Medical Association . Researchers found that diets rich in antioxidants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . CANCER <p> Do n't forget your fruits and vegetables . Cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and watercress contain phytochemicals called isothiocyanates that help our bodies to break down potential carcinogens . Bok choy , brussels sprouts , cauliflower , kale , mustard greens  --  there are countless cruciferous vegetables that will give you what you need . <p> A diet rich in vegetables from the allium food group , such as garlic , shallots and onions , reduce the risk of prostate cancer , according to a study by the National Cancer Institute . Scallions offer the most protection , but if you prefer garlic , the study suggests that one clove a day will suffice . <p> Similarly , fruits have these protective powers , as well . Tomatoes , for instance , contain lycopene , which protects cells against carcinogens . Or , if you prefer , a daily serving of berries protects against cancer , as well . <p> Several studies have found health benefits in berries . Researchers at Ohio State University discovered that berries stop tumors from growing in rats . Black raspberries are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anthocyanins  --  believed to protect against heart disease by lowering LDL cholesterol . Berries are also high in phenols such as ellagic acid , an antioxidant that protects the body 's cells . MOOD <p> " People self-regulate their mood continuously with foods , usually through sugar and fatty foods , " says Robert Thayer , Ph.D. , professor of psychology at California State University , Long Beach . " It immediately makes them feel better , but unfortunately the effect is short-term . " <p> Thankfully there are healthful foods that can help lift your spirits . Recent research , published in Brain , Behavior , and Immunity , reports that there is a link between the amino acid tryptophan and mood changes . Researchers lowered the level of tryptophan in 27 volunteers  --  16 of whom had an immediate relative with major depression . Study authors found that depression occurred in half of the subjects who had a family history of depression , but in only 9 percent of those with no such family history . Foods such as turkey , milk and bananas contain tryptophan . <p> Additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trigger the same reactions as some antidepressants , according to a recent study in the American Journal of Psychiatry . The study authors found that chocolate releases endorphins , proteins with analgesic properties that occur naturally in the brain . But do n't overdo it on a box of chocolates ; just a tiny bit will give you a boost . <p> " By no means are we fully up to date on what science can tell us about the benefits of certain foods , particularly regarding mood , " says Thayer . " Try a food pattern , observe yourself and see if it works for you . " OSTEOPOROSIS/MENOPAUSE <p> Milk is n't the only thing that prevents bone deterioration . Tea contains fluoride and flavonoids that include estrogenlike plant derivatives-both of which may enhance bone strength . A Taiwanese study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine surveyed 1,037 men and women who were longtime tea drinkers . Increased bone density was found in people who drank an average of two cups a day of black , green or oolong tea for at least six years . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including collards , broccoli , sesame seeds , sardines and , yes , soy . Postmenopausal women with high concentrations of soy in their diet had stronger bone health according to a study at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . " Regular inclusion of soy in the diet protects the bones " says Weil . " But it 's important for young women to know that you ca n't reverse osteoporosis by suddenly trying to increase your calcium intake at menopause . " <p> Soy is also important in reducing postmenopausal symptoms . An Australian study of 58 women found a 40 percent decrease in hot flashes among those who consumed 45 grams of soy flour a day over a 12-week period . Not a bad alternative to hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) , especially in light of HRT 's risks  --  such as coronary heart disease , stroke and blood clots . Soy , and other vegetables and fruits , contain phytoestrogens  --  plant compounds that may mimic estrogen hormones in animals . " The more women eat a plant-based diet , the more likely they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That does not mean a vegetarian diet but a diet that emphasizes fruits and vegetables and is low in animal fats . " MIND OVER MUNCHIES  --  CHANGING YOUR WAYS <p> You 've digested all of this foodwise information  --  so , now what ? Do you start downing bottles of wine , eating tons of chocolate and topping everything with nuts ? The challenge ahead is sensibly changing your eating habits and making them stick . Keep in mind that you have high-energy cycles and low-energy cycles throughout the day , says Thayer . Your energy is up in the morning , low in late afternoon and lowest before bed . " When you are aware that these periods occur , you need to grit your teeth and not give in , " he says . He also advises taking a short , brisk daily walk . It will temporarily raise your energy , and with increased energy you can resist food urges . HEALTHY EATING AND STAYING ON TRACK Start out slowly by tweaking your regular menu . Eat a soy burger instead of meat ; use soy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Make a deal with yourself : Try one new plant-based food a week . Eat a wide variety of plant-based foods so that you wo n't get tired of the same thing . Do n't add nuts to your diet ; substitute them for other foods like red meats . Stick to small portions of nuts . You do n't want to consume too much fat . Try stir-frying vegetables and brown rice . If you do n't like plain steamed vegetables , use a sauce or mix them with olive oil and garlic after steaming . Try to make one or two meals at home weekly . 9 ) Learn to prepare easy dishes . Healthy food can be delicious but need not be burdensome to prepare . Make gradual changes ; you are less likely to stick with radical change . Give yourself pep talks ; persuade yourself to make healthy choices . Seek social support . If you want to change your habits , associate more with people who have the kind of habits you want . Spend more time with people who eat healthfully . You say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slice of toast or stewed in a pot of sauce , the tomato may well be one of nature 's more flawless creations . But there 's more to this fruit than just its satisfying taste . The tomato is filled with lycopene  --  an antioxidant that benefits many areas of health . For example , researchers from Harvard have found that tomatoes reduce the risk of a variety of cancers including prostate , breast and ovarian . And in other research , tomatoes have been shown to lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients  --  a good sign for improving cardiovascular health . In the joints Go for the right balance in proteins <p> For healthy joints , protein is necessary in your daily diet . Yet the average American loads up on red meat , a protein high in saturated fat . Substituting fish for meat , however , is one simple change you can make . Fish is relatively low in saturated fat , and it contains polyunsaturated fatty acids , or omega-3s . These essential fatty acids have been shown to help reduce inflammation of the joints . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legumes such as lentils and black beans . Up in smoke Fresh ways to kick the nicotine habit <p> Quitting smoking is n't easy : 70 percent of smokers have made at least one failed attempt . Patches , gums and nasal inhalers provide nicotine without the cigarette . So , many smokers just trade their cigarettes in for gum . Now there are more natural ways to fight nicotine addiction . Exercise , for example , distracts you and increases serotonin to improve mood ; as do natural boosters including St. John 's wort and valerian . Other alternatives such as nicotine-free homeopathic gum are also available . Lucky clover Easing hot flashes can come naturally <p> Women are turning more and more to phytoestrogens to allay symptoms of menopause and osteoporosis . Phytoestrogens come in many forms ; the most potent are compounds called isoflavones , which are found in legumes such as soy and red clover . Clover , for one , contains a variety of isoflavones , including genistein , daidzein , formononetin and biochanin . It also contains flavonoid compounds called coumestans , which some studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jawbreakers A healthy smile that fights disease <p> What 's in your toothpaste ? Sadist mass-market products can contain chemicals that may be harmful to health . Sodium lauryl , sorbitol , alcohol and fluoride can have ill effects  --  such as skin irritation and canker sores . There are , however , natural components that can give you a healthy smile and even whiter teeth . Coenzyme Q10 , for example , is used in natural products because a deficiency can result in diseased gums , And aloe vera is a healing plant used to treat irritated skin , Likewise . perilla-seed extract reduces bacteria and plaque formation that can result in gingivitis and periodontitis .
