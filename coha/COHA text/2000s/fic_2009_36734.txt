Day One <p> " McNeil , she 's not signing this crap . " <p> " She told me she was signing it last week . " <p> " She told you she was considering it . " <p> " No . " I moved the phone to my other ear and pinned it there with my shoulder . With my hands free , I shifted about ten stacks of papers on my desk , looking for Jane Augustine 's contract . I punched the button on my phone that would send a bleating plea to my assistant . " She told me she was signing it . Period . " <p> " That 's insane . With that lame buyout clause ? No way . No . Way . You have no idea what you 're doing , kid . " <p> I felt a hard , familiar kernel of fear in my belly . <p> " It 's the same buyout clause she had in her last contract . " I ignored the personal comment he 'd lobbed at me . I had gotten my fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years and , although I acted like such comments did n't sting , I often thought , You 're right . I have no idea what I 'm doing . <p> I finally found the current contract under a pile of production- facility agreements . I flipped through it as fast as I could , searching for the clause in question . <p> My assistant , Q  --  short for Quentin  --  stuck his head in my office with a nervous what now ? look . I dropped the document and put my hand over the mouthpiece . " Can you get me Jane 's last contract ? " <p> He nodded quickly , his bald , black head shining under the fluorescent lights . He made a halfhearted attempt to find it amongst the chaos that was my law office  --  redwell folders that spanned the length of my visitors ' couch , file folders , motions and deposition transcripts stacked precariously on my desk . Throwing his hands up , Q spun around and headed for his own tidy and calm workstation . <p> " I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Severny was the biggest agent/lawyer in town , representing more than half of Chicago 's broadcasters and nearly all its top actors . " Change the buyout or we 're walking . NBC has been calling , and next time I 'm not telling them no . " <p> I swallowed down the tension that felt thick in my throat . Jane Augustine was the most popular news anchor at the station owned by Pickett Enterprises , my client . The CEO , Forester Pickett , was a huge fan of hers . I could n't lose Jane to another station . <p> Meanwhile , Severny kept rolling . " And I want a pay-or-play added to paragraph twenty-two . " <p> I flipped through the contract and found the paragraph . It was tough , yes , and it was favorable to Pickett Enterprises , but as much as I could n't lose Jane , I could n't simply give in to anything her agent wanted . My job was to land the terms most favorable to Pickett Enterprises , and although the stress of that job was always heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would do my job . There was no alternative . <p> " No pay-or-play , " I said . " It 's nonnegotiable . I told you that last time , and I 'm telling you again . That comes from Forester himself . " It always helped to throw Forester 's name in the mix , to remind people that I was here , making their lives tough , because he wanted me to . <p> " Then let 's talk about the non compete . " <p> " Let 's do that . " I thumbed through the contract , grateful to have seemingly won a point . Q darted into the room with Jane 's previous contract , cleared a space on my desk and put it down . <p> I nodded thanks . <p> Q then placed a sheet of white paper on top of it , giving me a sympathetic smile . In red ink , he 'd written , Izzy , your meeting with the wedding Nazi is in forty-five minutes . <p> " Crap , " I said . <p> " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's what I told you before . It is crap . And we 're not signing it ! " And with that , he hung up . <p> " Mother hen in a basket ! " I yelled , slamming down the phone . <p> I was trying not to swear anymore . I thought it sounded crass when people swore . The problem was it sounded great to me when I did it . And it felt so damn good . But swearing was n't appropriate at a law firm , as Q had reminded me on more than one occasion , and so I was replacing things like goddammit with God bless you and Jesus Christ with Jiminy Christmas and motherfucker with mother hen in a basket . <p> Q sank into a chair across from my desk . " I know you 're crazed , and I know you have to leave soon , but first I need some of your fiery , redheaded decisiveness . " <p> I sat down , crossed my hands on my desk and gave Q my army-general stare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Q was wearing his usual crisp khakis and a blazer . He tugged at the blazer to try to hide the slightly protruding belly he hated  --  his personal nemesis to the perfect gay physique . Not that this deterred him from sizing up the rest of the male species . Q had emerged from the closet six years prior , and though he had a live-in boyfriend , Max , he still enjoyed the " new gay " privilege of ogling every man he came across . <p> He paused dramatically now . " Max 's mother is coming to town tomorrow . " <p> " I see your problem . " Max 's mother was a former Las Vegas showgirl , an eccentric woman with whom you 'd love to grab a martini , but who wears you out after two hours . The last time she 'd come to Chicago , Q nearly broke up with Max just for an excuse to get out of the house . <p> " How long is she in for ? " I asked . <p> " Two weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " I know it 's not going to work . " <p> " You can make her help with your Halloween party this weekend . " <p> He nodded , reluctantly conceding the point . " What am I going to do the rest of the time ? " <p> " Watch a lot of football ? " Q had retained many of his straight-man tendencies . A love of football was one of them . <p> Q had gray eyes that I 'd always found calming , but they flashed with irritation now . " That 's another not decisive , Izzy . There 's a question mark at the end of that sentence . And you know she 'll hover and talk , hover and talk . I wo n't see a single play . " <p> " Okay , okay . Tell Max she has to stay in a hotel , and you guys will pay for part of it . " <p> Q ran his hands over his head again . " I guess maybe that would work . " He sighed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " No , you do n't . " <p> " Yes , I do . " <p> Just then Tanner Hornsby , a high-ranking partner in his mid-forties , walked by my office . He was tall , with deep-black hair ( dyed , I suspected ) that arched into a widow 's peak . He was rumored to run five miles a day , every day , before work , and so he was lean and wiry , but he had the tired , slightly puffy eyes of a career drinker . <p> He stopped now and frowned at us . <p> Q turned in his seat . " Oh , hello , Mr. Hornsby , " he said in a breathy , effeminate voice , which he doled out only to annoy certain people like Tanner and his father . <p> " Hi , Tan , " I said . <p> His frown deepened . No one called him Tan . He was Mr. Hornsby to most , and Tanner to the elite few , myself definitely not included , but I needed him to consider me his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tan because I wanted him to know he did n't scare me , even if he did . Behind closed doors , Q and I had other names for him  --  Toad Horny , Tanned Hide , the Horned One <p> " I could n't help but hear your phone conversation from down the hall , " Tanner said . " Was that Steve Severny you were speaking with ? Problems ? " <p> Tanner Hornsby had negotiated hundreds of contracts with Steve Severny . Severny would never tell Tanner he did n't know what he was doing . <p> " No problems . " I gave Tanner my dutiful-nice-girl look that served me well at the law firm of Baltimore &amp; Brown . Though truthfully , I did n't need the look anymore . The ludicrous amount of dough I pulled in through the Pickett Enterprises work allowed me to get away with just about anything . I was my own little island amid a sea of associates who had n't been as lucky as me and , as a result , were forced to be ass kissers and line-toers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isabel ? " <p> " Just fine , Tan , thanks for asking . " <p> Ever since Forester Pickett had made me the lead attorney for Pickett Enterprises , taking the cases away from Tanner , Tanner had hated me . Tanner was lifelong friends with Forester 's son , Shane . He 'd originally gotten the Pickett Enterprises work because of that connection and thought he 'd never lose it . Every so often , Tanner tried to throw his lean , wiry weight around and remind me that he was still my superior by asking questions about billable hours or continuing legal education . I felt bad for him . I felt guilty . I had n't tried to take Forester 's work from him . Forester had simply taken a shine to me , and I rode that windfall as far as I could . I knew many attorneys at the firm thought I 'd gotten the work because I was a woman  --  a young woman with long curls of red hair who was n't afraid to wear high , high heels and drink with Forester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , I did n't care . I adored Forester . He was a smart , sweet man  --  not one of those older guys who oh so accidentally kept touching your hand and your elbow and your lower back . No , Forester was a prince , and like a prince he 'd swooped in and saved me from the torment and agony of being just another associate slave . The job was hard , but I knew I was now doing good things for Pickett Enterprises . Still , that knowledge could n't hedge my occasional yet powerful bouts of self-doubt or the feeling that I was an impostor , one who could be exposed at any time . <p> Tanner grunted . " Keep the hours up . We 've got the end of the year soon . " <p> I put a concerned look on my face , as if I did n't have the top billable hours of any associate at the firm , and nodded . " Sure . Will do . " <p> He left . Thank God . <p> My cell phone dinged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my desk . I picked it up . A text message from Sam . Hey , Red Hot Leaving for Cassandra 's . See you there . <p> " Dammit . " Cassandra was the wedding planner . <p> Q raised his eyebrows . <p> " Darn it , " I corrected . <p> I swiveled around and started scrambling through the chaos on my credenza until I found my bag . I could n't be late again . Plus , I needed to talk to Sam about this wedding stuff , which was starting to weigh me down as heavily as my job . <p> " Are you taking home the Casey research ? " Q asked . " We have to file the motion by tomorrow . " <p> " I know , I know . " I stuffed a pile of case law and my Dictaphone into my bag . <p> " And do n't forget Sam 's work dinner tonight at the Union League Club , " Q said . <p> I tried to ignore the mountain of panic taking over my insides . " Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always are . But I 'll leave early and work on the motion . " <p> " You can do it , " Q said . " You always do . " <p> " Thanks . " I stopped and smiled , and he flashed one back . <p> As I kept stuffing things into my bag , I thought about how a big blowout wedding had not been my idea . In fact , when Sam and I got engaged , I was fine to book a trip to the Caribbean with a few friends , throw on a little slip dress and get married to the sound of steel drums . But my mother , who had n't planned much of anything , or did n't usually care about much of anything , seemed stuck on a huge , traditional wedding . And my soon-to-be husband , who had legions of friends from grade school , high school , college , business school and work , said he was on board for that as well . I want everyone to see how much I love you , he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> My phone rang . Q took a step toward my desk and we both looked at the caller ID . Victoria McNeil . My mother . <p> Q picked it up , handed it to me and left the office . <p> " Hi , Mom . " I zipped up my bag . " What 's up ? " <p> " Izzy , I know you two picked out the plates with the silver border for the reception , but I think we should consider the gold again . " My mother 's voice was calm and smooth , as always . " I 've been thinking about it , and the linens are a soft white , rather than a crisp white , and that really lends itself toward gold rather than silver . " <p> " That 's fine . Whatever you think . " Reflexively , I extended the fingers of my left hand and glanced at my engagement ring , an antique , art-deco piece with an emerald-cut diamond . Looking at my ring used to make me grin . Now , it made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another thing . If you talk to your brother , Charlie , give him a little encouragement , will you ? We need him to try on suits . " <p> " The wedding is still six weeks away . " <p> " That 's right . Only six weeks away . " <p> My stomach hollowed . Only six weeks . <p> " Charlie has to stop dragging his feet , " my mom said . <p> I murmured in vague agreement , but for once I felt sim-patico with my brother . Mentally , I , too , needed to stop dragging my feet about this wedding thing . <p> " Do n't forget , you have another dress fitting tomorrow night . " <p> I tried not to sigh . " I know , " I said . " Battle number five . " <p> During the first visits with my bridal seamstress , Maria , it seemed she was trying to flatten my breasts and hide my hips , parts of my body I rather liked . I kept telling her , " I think the dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dutifully making the bustline lower and the waistline tighter , until the last time , when she 'd taken the pins out of her mouth and said in her accented English , " You want to look like hooker on wedding day ? " <p> I told her I 'd think about it . <p> I realized that most women wanted an ethereal look for their wedding , but I liked wearing sexy clothes on a daily basis , so why not for my wedding day ? Plus , Sam said he wanted me in something hot . So I was going to give him hot . <p> " Izzy , really , " my mom said . " I do n't want you showing nipple on your wedding day . " <p> I laughed , and it felt good , like it was loosening up my insides . " See you tomorrow . " <p> I logged off the computer , grabbed my bag and left to meet Sam . <p> It was just an average day . <p> The funny thing  --  although maybe funny is n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day could slap you around and send you reeling . I 'd had such a day twenty-one years ago when my father died . It was Tuesday , and it was gloriously sunny and clear  --  I always remember the weather first  --  and Charlie and I were playing in the leaves in the backyard , making painstakingly neat piles , which we would dive into with a yelp and destroy in an instant . <br> Continues ...
