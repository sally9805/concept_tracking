Chapter One : Sunny 's Wedding Toast New Year 's Day , This Year , Santa Fe Before he kidnapped me from my own wedding reception , Sunny Boy Blue that little prick , that darling Backwards Boy he nearly skipped the Big Event altogether . He was scheduled for Christmas , but to the tune of my mother 's tears , he missed his flight . Then he missed another , and it seemed that Russia was holding him back , like honey , or a fly trap . Alas , he pulled free with less than twenty-four hours to spare , time enough to wreak a little havoc , assassinate my New Year 's Day , my birthday , my wedding day , all my big holidays clustered together , a gaggle of ducks waiting to be shot down by this drunken imposter flown in from Russia . By the reception dinner , I wished him dead . Such a lovely scene , white linen tablecloths , candles , turkey and all the fixings . Any idiot with a camera knows it when he sees it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Groom with their families , the Wedding Party , seven of them at the table . I , Jennie , the Bride , had no choice in this ; one can not have a Wedding Party Table without the Family of the Bride , after all . Self-educated in protocol though this Bride may be , she knows the names of things , the proper and orderly procession of ceremony and event . Her brother at her table is the price this Bride pays for normalcy . I am the Bride and Chris is the Groom . The Happy Two , sitting like figurines at the table of honor . The room smells of the garlands of pine hung everywhere , from the vigas , around the doors , at the bases of candles on each table . Never mind her lumberjack shoulders and hulking seventy inches , this Bride , in her getup elegant forties-era satin gown , red lipstick , hair in a French twist she looks like a period piece . The Groom should be wearing a crisp uniform ; he should be on his way to war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers making an arch of their swords , and the Happy Couple should pass beneath it . Or , at the very least , the Wedding Party should all be laughing , leaning over to exchange pleasantries , lit by candles . She has left disposable cameras on every table for the guests , and later she can study photographs of the Wedding Party Happiness in a Wedding Album . Instead , before I could even take a bite of food , the Brother of the Bride pushed back his chair so hard it clattered to the floor . " Time for a toast , " he shouted , raising the silver flask of vodka he 'd been waving around since he got off the plane . The general murmur of conversation died down . People tittered nervously . What would the misbehaving brother come up with next ? His curling black lashes hung low over his eyes . He looked not so much drunk as sleepy . " Gorko ! Gorko ! " he cried . " Which , for the uneducated , means Bitter ! Bitter ! Russians yell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeten the wine . So everyone , all together now ! " He did n't even wait for them ; he tipped back that flask and took a long , thirsty gulp . " Gorko , " the guests cried , out of embarrassment or pity or even good humor . " Gorko ! " Trapping me from behind , my brother wraps his arms around me , his chin on my shoulder , his cheek to mine , and I steel myself against the stink of his vodka breath , the cigarettes , the odd underlying whiff of gasoline on him , and I smile broadly . A flurry of flashes comes from the tables , and I smile , smile , smile . At last I can pull away , and my brother catches my look . His eyes are pale green , so light they almost seem transparent . See-through eyes , I 've always called them . These are my father 's eyes . See , there 's old Daddy , Father of the Bride , sitting at the table too , in a tux , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little belly , his wild hair pulled back , looking practically normal himself , his eyes so sad and lost they almost break me . The Brother straightens . It seems his toast , if that 's what it is , will go on . " Juniper boughs for Juniper 's wedding , " he says to the room , pointing his flask at the centerpiece . " In Russia , this is called Troitsa . Branches all over the houses , maidens ' panties in the trees . " He tells the guests all about Russians . He says that Russians eat lard like Americans eat peanut butter , on spoons , straight from the can . To roll a joint , they shake tobacco from a cigarette and use the paper ; they 'll even use a ruble . He 's funny , charming , in the way loud , charismatic people are . The guests seem to be enjoying him ; they laugh , listen , laugh again . The Mother of the Bride is beside herself with adoration . The new In-Laws , the Bravermans , sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bites . Let him die , the Bride thinks , then takes it back , though God is n't listening anyway . God seems to have gone fishing , so the Bride prays to the God of Vodka , to the Minor Deities of Other Foreign Chemicals . Please , take him out of the picture for the night . Please , the Bride prays , I 'll take drool , vomit , anything , just shut him up , silence him completely . She says , " What , exactly , is the point here ? " " The point ! " the Brother announces to the room . " Juniper wants a point ! " He leans over her shoulder and breathes his smoky vodka breath into her face . " Am I getting on your nerves ? Am I pissing you off ? " She looks into his see-through eyes . She tells him no . His nose touches hers . He whispers , " Liar , liar , Juniper Tree on Fire . " He straightened . " The point , " he said , raising his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely bride ! " I stared down at the boots he wore with his tuxedo , heavy black combat-issue storm troopers . He leaned around me and pointed the flask at Chris . " To her brave groom , Mr. Braverman . " " I 'll drink to my bride , " Chris said , raising his glass . " To the lovely Mrs. Braverman . " He was smiling , playing along with the joke , only his eyes in my direction were checking on me , saying , I 'm on your side , Cinderella . Then Sunny looked straight at my groom . When he spoke , his voice was cold , sober , hateful . He said , " Here 's hoping she does n't leave you like she leaves everyone else . " For a beat , a second split down its middle like an atom , the room was still . Then my new husband , Mr. Prince Charming , smiled and said to the room , " Too late . She 's already left me several times . She leaves me every day for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And the crowd , relieved , laughed and drank and went back to their food , and my brother righted his chair and sat down . So this is what I remember of the last time I saw Sunny : his eyes , his boots . His breath . Over and over again , his voice , loud , slurred , crying , whispering , hissing : " Juniper ! " As if that name were the only word he spoke . How did you sleep ? Juniper ! Are you hungry ? Juniper Tree Burning ! I think of the two days , New Year 's Eve and New Year 's Day , like two sides of a coin with a hole through the middle , and out of it comes pale green eyes and heavy black boots and rank vodka breath , and out of that hole Sunny Boy Blue taunts me with the name he knew I hated . I remember these various snatches of him , and I remember the fact that he kidnapped me from my own wedding reception , and I would rip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So he stole from me even the role of injured party . Once you know the guy has kicked the bucket , it 's all a petty crime , is n't it ? He 's the winner after all , in his delightful game of Get the Bride . The Bride , meaning me , this Ugly Chick all gussied up in the fancy dress . Nothing extraordinary about her at all , this Bride ; she 's commonplace , ordinary , in fact , the I-do , the Yes , the Kiss . Line her up with fifty others , their trains fanned out on the altar steps , the half-wistful , romantic gaze the photographer instructs them to hold . She 's not the Bride ; she 's the bride . I had been waiting all my life to step into her outlines . I have always known my rightful place in the world , which was not in New Mexico , not with my parents in a mud house without running water , and most of all , not with a name like Juniper Tree Burning . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid knows when she 's in the wrong place . I wanted to be the bride . I wanted to fall backwards into the comfort of normalcy , like a child in the wilderness who nestles into the the snow and sleeps . I do n't understand those people who want to be outside the universe of the ordinary . I was the bride , and this was enough for me . It was not snow , but a featherbed , gloriously warm and safe : it was rest . But Sunny would not allow me to rest . He kept pulling me back into the wilderness , calling me Juniper , trying to make me be what I am not . The bride and the groom stand with a knife between their palms and slice into the cake . They hook their elbows and feed each other a bite , another Wedding Album opportunity . " Juniper , " calls the brother , " smash it in his face ! " The bride glares at him . A flashbulb explodes . The crowd sets off a strobe of flashes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bride 's angry , the groom 's startled , cake still on their fingers . Here , in the Wedding Album , it will say , Another Moment Stolen by the Brother of the Bride . " I know a joke , " my brother said , raising a champagne bottle . " How does it start ? " The people clotted around him raised their champagne glasses , obedient sheep , and waited for the next commotion . " Let 's see , " he said . " In the last thirteen years , my sister what is her name now ? Oh , yes . Jennifer Braverman . It 's hard to keep track , is n't it ? " He lit a cigarette and used his cake plate for an ashtray . " Anyway , I 've seen my sister , Jennifer Braverman , five times since I was six years old . " He held up his fist and unfolded it for them , middle finger first : " When she first went off to college , at the Taos Inn , for both our high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time at the Taos Inn does n't really count , since she sent me away . " His hand , fingers splayed , out like a traffic cop stopping a wayward motorist . He sucked hard on his cigarette . " Is n't that right , Juniper ? " " More than that , " I said . I held myself at a distance watching this woman , this bride , suck cake off the tip of her finger . She is happy . See , in the Wedding Album , you 'll be able to tell : she 's happy . Even as I spoke , the guests busily flashed away , recording proof of said happiness . " Trust me , " Sunny said , and took in another ravenous lungful of smoke . " It 's five . Is n't this funny ? I knew you would n't believe me . " In the dim reception hall , so artfully candlelit , the cigarette glowed and faded . " So the joke goes like this : my big sister works in Taos for the summer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer long , she promises to visit me but never shows up . Must be truly busy or something . So one day I 'm thirteen years old I get up early and ride my bike seventy-nine miles , all the way from Santa Fe to Taos . Espaola , the canyon . Shit , you know that hill coming out of the canyon ? It 's August , and hot as hell . Thought I 'd die . So I ride all the way to Taos , and I go straight to where she 's working at the Taos Inn , and I 'm standing in the lobby , thinking she 'll be so impressed , so happy to see her baby brother . " His cigarette glowing , fading , marking the progress of his story , his audience waiting for the happy ending . He continued on the exhale , smoke with his words : " But the joke 's on me , because my sister God bless her , always looking out for my best interests she tells me , ' Go home . ' That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My brother drank from the bottle , and when he slammed it on the table , foam rose over its lip and slid down its neck . Everyone followed his lead , draining their glasses as anyone should at the end of a toast , but their eyes were troubled , as if these were not drinks they offered but needed . Sunny started away , finished with us , I hoped , but then he turned , slapping his head as if he 'd forgotten the punch line . There were guests passing between us . He looked around them and over them and through them , and locked his see-through green eyes on me . I thought , Now , is n't this downright exciting . Just exactly what else will he do for revenge ? Beside me , Chris took my hand and squeezed it , to anchor me , or maybe to hold me back . I 'm here , his fingers said , fondling my ring , stroking my palm . Right here . " Five times , " my brother said . He spouted some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life a cocksucking bitch . " Chris , my groom , my gallant prince , whispered , his lips moving against my ear , " Right now , I 'm saying exactly what you need to hear , and now you can laugh and show him he is n't winning . " I smiled as if he had done his job , but I thought , Is there nothing else you can do to help me ? What kind of Prince Charming are you ? Over Chris 's shoulder , my brother smiled back at me . I see you , his eyes said . I see right through you . Every time I remember the way he ruined it all , meaning everything that mattered to me , I find myself sucked into the scene as if it were unfolding again , as if this time I can change its inevitable conclusion . But this is history , Jennie my dear , and so it will happen the same way every time . Even you can not revise it . Even God .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
