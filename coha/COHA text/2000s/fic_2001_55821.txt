THE BOY was STUDYING the rivers of Europe on the computer . He traced the path of the Danube and watched its seven mouths empty into the Black Sea , or Pontus Euxinus , a name the Romans used long before Jesus was born . <p> It was the end of November . Patches of snow were on the ground from a two-inch fall the day before . He was twelve years old and was being educated at home . It had been two years since his mother had moved the boy and his uncle , the mother 's younger brother , to the house in the mountains at Sweetheart Gap . His father was dead , killed by a disease in Africa , where he had gone to serve as a missionary . He had been an engineer who designed and installed water systems for villages . <p> " It was something in that water , " his mother always said when he questioned her about the circumstances surrounding his father 's death . <p> He had looked up diseases of a like kind on the web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of things : some parasite , an amoeba , a bacterium . He was glad they drank pure well water up on Sweetheart Gap . <p> His mother was managing a hotel in a nearby resort town . She had been fired from her job as a schoolteacher because she insisted on leading her class in prayer . Her picture and an account of her battle with the city of Charlotte were on their church 's website . <p> From the living room came the sound of the TV . Gabriel , the boy 's uncle , a man of twenty-five but with the mind of a child , was constantly before it , sitting there with his Bible in his lap , the Bible he could not read and could only dimly understand if it were read to him . <p> " Thou shalt not steal , " Gabriel said in a firm , clear voice . <p> He always started with that one and then ran through the others . There were times when he got stuck on the commandments and spent the whole day saying them over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were of Gabriel intoning passages from the Bible . Once Gabriel had been able to repeat any book or part of a book . He had the entire Bible inside his head . The boy 's grandmother , now dead and buried in Atlanta , had discovered how God had touched her son . She was the one who read the Bible out loud to him until he had those books by heart . Gabriel had been on TV many times . But then one day he could remember nothing but the commandments . <p> Ever since they had come to live at Sweetheart Gap he had been stealing . His victims were the people from Charlotte who owned the summer houses on the ridge above them . He made no attempt to conceal what he had stolen . He piled the televisions and VCRs and cameras on the desk in his room . On weekends the boy 's mother made Gabriel load the merchandise in her van , and she went from house to house making restitution and delivering apologies . <p> The stealing had stopped when Gabriel grew fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last growing so large that the walk up the steep road to the ridge was impossible for him . The houses up there overlooked a famous gorge , and on extremely clear days the occupants were presented with a faint view of the gilded top of the tallest building in Charlotte . <p> Every morning his mother cooked Gabriel stacks of pancakes , country ham , eggs , and grits . The cupboard was always filled with potato chips and cakes . Gabriel spent the day eating and watching TV . <p> " Gabriel 's fat , " the boy announced to his mother one day while Gabriel sat before the TV devouring a huge piece of chocolate cake . <p> " It 's better than jail , " she said . " It 's better than the state hospital . " <p> The state hospital was close at hand , in the town at the foot of the mountain . It was a cluster of buildings all constructed of red brick . The grounds were covered with trees and flowers , but there were heavy wire screens over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain-link fence surrounding an outdoor basketball court . <p> Gabriel came into the room . He wore a Carolina Panthers sweatsuit . <p> " I want to see , " Gabriel said . " Please let me see , Lawrence ? " <p> That was a request the boy heard a hundred times a day . Gabriel wanted to look at pornography on the computer . <p> " Mama 's got the password , " he said . " I do n't know it . " <p> " Do it . " <p> " I ca n't . " <p> " I 'll show you a bear . Show it to Margaret too . " <p> Margaret Cully was a girl of fifteen or sixteen who worked at her father 's convenience store . The store was five miles away and mostly uphill . The boy 's mother refused Gabriel 's frantic requests to stop whenever they drove by . Gabriel always scrambled as best he could to the back of the van and watched the store recede in the rear window . <p> " What bear ? " the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " There and gone . Before I was fat . Up through the flowers . A hole in the rock where he sleeps . " <p> He had learned to be patient with Gabriel . In the conversation that followed , he discovered that Gabriel believed he knew where a bear had his den . He had surprised the bear on the road , and it had gone up the side of the mountain . <p> " Into the flowers , " Gabriel said . <p> He supposed that meant the bear had vanished into a rhododendron thicket . The rhododendron had not been in flower since the end of June . That was when Gabriel had first begun to get truly large and had paid some of his last visits to the summer houses . The bears in the mountains were hunted in season by men with dogs , so they were wary . But he thought it was possible that what Gabriel had told him was true . <p> " Let me see , " Gabriel said . <p> " What 's there to see ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit card . " <p> " Let me see . " <p> " You 're sure you know where to find that bear 's den ? " <p> " Up in the flowers . " <p> " You 'll show me ? You promise ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Ten minutes . That 's all . " <p> He bypassed the parental controls and handed the machine over to Gabriel . <p> Then he went into the living room and sat in front of the TV and waited for the ten minutes to pass . Gabriel had been watching a show about antiques . An auction was in progress . A wardrobe was being sold . Ten thousand dollars flashed up on the screen . <p> When the time was up , he returned to the room . Gabriel was watching two naked women kissing each other . The boy could not understand why anyone would want to watch that . He took the mouse out of Gabriel 's hand . <p> " More , " Gabriel said . <p> " No , now you show me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He expected that Gabriel would somehow give him directions , for it was impossible for Gabriel to lead him to the bear 's den . <p> " I 'll show you , " Gabriel said . " Come along . " <p> Gabriel went out of the room . The boy followed his slow progress through the house and out the kitchen door and into the garage , where he had a difficult time going down three low steps . It was cold . Gabriel 's breath came out in white puffs . <p> " How 're you gon na walk up a hill ? " he asked . <p> Gabriel grinned and walked across the empty garage and opened the door to the storeroom . He pulled from a shelf a stack of boxes they had used when they moved and then brought down something made of metal with plastic-coated steel cables attached to it . <p> " Come along , " Gabriel said . <p> Then he understood what the object was . He had once seen it demonstrated on TV . <p> " We 're gon na winch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come along , " Gabriel said . Then he laughed , his breath coming out in large white puffs . " You want to see the bear 's hole ? " Gabriel asked . <p> The boy thought about the bear , wondering if it all was some sort of fabrication on Gabriel 's part . <p> " How did that bear run up the hill ? " he asked . <p> " Up through the flowers , " Gabriel said . <p> " No , how ? Show me . How did its legs move ? " <p> Gabriel got down on all fours on the concrete floor and gave a slow but correct imitation of a bear 's gait . His front and back legs moved in unison , just like a bear 's . But then he slipped and fell heavily and lay there for a time like a seal basking on an ice floe until with some help from the boy he got to his feet again . <p> " I 'm a bear , " Gabriel said . " Up the mountain fast . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said firmly . <p> Sometimes Gabriel got stuck on something , and he became like a loop of videotape , playing the same scene over and over . He did not want to listen to Gabriel saying he was a bear for the next week . <p> They walked slowly along the road , now completely clear of snow . He carried the come-along and a camera he planned to use to take a picture of the bear 's den . Gabriel had put a box of doughnuts and several cans of Coke in a backpack he carried slung over one shoulder because even without his winter clothes on he was much too large for it to fit . <p> Above them was the long , thin ridge that held the summer houses . The oaks and hickories were bare , but in places the slope was covered with thick stands of rhododendron . Water trickled out of the mountain and made puddles on the road that at night would freeze . Patches of frozen seep-water still lay on the shady side of the road . <p> " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't expecting there to be , " he said . <p> He was irritated with himself at allowing Gabriel access to the pictures of women . And if that piece of stupidity was not enough , he was out here in the cold proceeding along the road at a pace not much faster than a small child could crawl . Gabriel was already breathing hard , and the road ran perfectly level at this point . He was going to fall behind with his schoolwork . He reviewed in his mind the principal rivers of Europe . <p> " There 's gon na be a bear , " Gabriel said . " Up in the flowers . " <p> " We 're not going to see a bear 's den , " the boy said . <p> " No ! No ! Up in the flowers ! " Gabriel stopped and turned to face him . He looked as if he were on the verge of tears , and the boy was sorry for what he had said . <p> " Yes , maybe we 'll see that ole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flowers , " Gabriel said . " Down in the rock . " <p> A truck came along and slowly passed them . The boy waved at the men inside , and they waved back . He had seen the men , those gaunt hunters , before . There was a metal dog-box in the truckbed . Through the air holes he saw pieces of dogs : an eye , a tongue , teeth , a tail . <p> " Bear hunters , " he said . <p> " No , not my bear , " Gabriel said . <p> " Yes . " <p> " No ! No ! " Gabriel was now in tears . The boy went up and stood before him , the immense bulk of his uncle towering over him . <p> " You made me let you see , " the boy said . <p> " The bear , " Gabriel said . <p> " Yes , but you could have just shown me the bear . " <p> " Kill the bear . " He was crying harder now . <p> " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They 're after coons . " The boy had no idea what the men were hunting . Perhaps at this time of year all the bears were asleep in their dens . <p> " Coons , " Gabriel said . <p> " Yes , coons , " the boy said . <p> Gabriel wiped his eyes and nose on first one coat sleeve and then the other . The boy patted him on the leg as he might have done to a horse . Gabriel smiled down at him . <p> It was noon , and they were still on the asphalt road , which now was running slightly downhill . They had been out for an hour , and besides the hunters only two other trucks had passed . The boy sat down in a patch of sunlight on a rock , and Gabriel sat in the shade . The boy had two doughnuts out of the box , and Gabriel ate the rest . They drank one Coke apiece . <p> " How far ? " he asked . <p> Gabriel , his back turned , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mother had to struggle with constantly . He looked up and down the road , thankful no one had appeared . <p> " Close , " Gabriel said . <p> He checked to make sure Gabriel had zipped his pants . <p> The road dropped more sharply . The slope above was a rhododendron thicket . He heard water running but could not see it . They came upon a gravel road that ran off to the right , going up at a moderate grade . <p> " Here , " Gabriel said . <p> " Up in the flowers ? " the boy asked . <p> Gabriel nodded his head . <p> At first it seemed to the boy that Gabriel might be able to go up the road unassisted . He moved ahead at his maddeningly slow pace , impelled , the boy imagined , by the thought of those ten minutes at the computer . The boy resolved that he would never be persuaded again . <p> But then Gabriel stopped . He tottered there on the road , the gravel crunching as he attempted to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Pull me , " Gabriel said . <p> The boy walked up and attached the come-along to a tree . Then he ran the cables back and attached the hook on the end to a piece of rope he tied around Gabriel 's waist . Gabriel struggled to his feet . The boy worked the lever , and Gabriel ascended the road with a smile on his face . <p> It was easy , but the boy considered how long it was going to take them at twenty yards a pitch to get wherever they were going . He soon discovered there were level stretches where Gabriel could walk as the road ascended the mountain in a series of switchbacks . They crossed a bridge over a stream , where they rested for a time . While Gabriel drank another Coke , the boy looked for trout holding in the eddies behind the bridge footers . <p> They went up , the road sometimes running between dense rhododendron thickets or leafless stands of hardwoods . When he asked Gabriel how far the bear 's den was , he received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Gabriel said . " Up high . " <p> The boy 's satisfaction with the efficiency of the come-along soon disappeared as he was confronted with the tediousness of the operation . He checked and double-checked the attachment of the hook to Gabriel 's harness . He imagined Gabriel slipping out of it and tumbling down the road , perhaps even off the road , where in a rhododendron thicket even his great body would be brought to rest by the net of branches . He wished the hunters would appear and give them a ride in the back of their truck . <p> The higher they went , the more snow there was . Finally patches of snow began to appear on the road . He had almost ceased to think about the bear 's den . His arms and shoulders were tired from working the lever . <p> They reached another place where the road ran level , but this was obviously not a switchback . On the uphill side was a huge rhododendron thicket and on the other open timber . Far below he saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highway and beside it a farmhouse looking like a toy set at the edge of a field of bright-green winter wheat . <p> Gabriel started off along the road . <p> " Up high ? " the boy said . " Up high ? What 's higher than this ? " <p> " Come along , " Gabriel said , and walked away laughing . <p> The road curved , and then instead of another rhododendron thicket there was a house . They were on the top of the ridge containing the summer houses . Gabriel had tricked him by bringing him up the back way . <p> Filled with outrage , the boy stepped in front of Gabriel and brought him to a halt like a handler stopping an obedient elephant . " There 's no bear , " he said . " You came to steal . " <p> " Thou shalt not steal , " Gabriel said . <p> " But you 're going to steal . I wo n't help you back down the hill if you do . " <p> " I 'll tell Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same pleased look was on Gabriel 's face as when he had pulled the come-along down from the shelf . <p> Whatever Gabriel had come up to steal could not be heavy , the boy reflected . Something light and portable that he himself could easily return , as his mother had so many times . If he were lucky he would be able to do it without his mother 's knowledge . There was no way he could stop Gabriel from doing whatever he had come all the way up the steep road to do . At least he was sure that Gabriel could be appeased to keep silent about the computer . <p> They walked along the road . The houses were all on one side , for the view . He looked for the gilded tower of the tallest building , but there was a bit of haze in the air off toward Charlotte , so he could see nothing of the city . <p> He imagined that Gabriel would pick a house at random and start looking for something to steal . The first year they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalled driving along this road with his mother with three chainsaws in the back of the van . She stopped and asked at each house until she had returned two of the saws and they had come to the end of the row of houses . The owner of the third came for it the next weekend . <p> Gabriel paused and looked at a house . He shambled up the stone walk to the door and looked through the window set in it . Then he went all the way around the house , looking in the windows . The door to a utility room in the back was unlocked . Gabriel pushed it open . Tools hung on hooks set in wallboard . A chainsaw was on the floor . <p> " There it is , " the boy said , pointing at the saw . " Get it , and let 's go home . But I 'm not carrying it . " <p> Instead Gabriel took up a sledgehammer . <p> " That 's not worth much , " the boy said . <p> Gabriel ignored him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy closed it and followed Gabriel around to the front of the house . Instead of going on down the road , Gabriel walked to the front door . Before the astonished boy could say a word , Gabriel drew back the hammer and smashed the lock . The door sprung back and hit the wall . Gabriel dropped the hammer , which made a clang when it hit the brick porch . Then he walked inside , leaving the boy standing in the mid-afternoon sunlight . The boy looked out to the deserted road . He looked toward the houses on either side , cut off from view by a thick growth of hemlocks . The sound of the hammer on the door was long gone , but he could still imagine it and thought that at any moment some human voice would rise in protest over what Gabriel had just done . But nothing happened . Two crows sailed lazily overhead , cawing softly to each other . <p> Then Gabriel emerged from the house with a chair . It looked puny and insignificant in his hands , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carved , and the boy knew at once that this was an object much more valuable than a chainsaw . <p> Gabriel , oblivious to the shattered door behind him and the chance , however remote , that someone might come along on the road , sat down on the porch steps . He was still breathing hard from the exertion required to smash the door . He took off his gloves and ran his hands lightly over the carving . <p> " Leave it , " the boy said . " Take the chainsaw . " <p> Gabriel shook his head . Then , under the boy 's questioning , he explained why he had stolen the chair . He had seen the owners obtaining an estimate of its value on a TV show . He had recognized them , for they had come to the house to retrieve the chainsaw that was now sitting in their utility room . <p> " Five thousand dollars , " Gabriel said . <p> " What would you do with five thousand dollars ? " the boy asked . <p> " Margaret Cully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name with reverence , as if he were saying a prayer . <p> " ATV , " Gabriel said . " I 'm gon na ride up to see Margaret . " <p> A person could drive an ATV without a license . He imagined Gabriel riding it along the highway to the convenience store . All the gravel roads would be open to him . He could steal a few chainsaws every day . <p> " Look at that door , " the boy said . " They 'll catch you . They 'll take you to that house in Leesville . " <p> Gabriel knew what that was . Usually the threat of sending him there made him afraid , but his only reaction was to smile . <p> " They 'll find out , " the boy said . He tried to take the chair out of Gabriel 's hands , but his uncle was much too strong . <p> " Margaret Cully , " Gabriel said . <p> He imagined Margaret recoiling in horror from Gabriel 's attentions . He wanted to kiss her like the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trapped . And this time he might end up behind the razor wire . <p> " Put it back , " he said . <p> " No , " Gabriel said . <p> " Then let 's go home . " At least if they were home before his mother returned from work , there might be some way for him to return the chair . He left Gabriel and , carrying the come-along , walked to the edge of the cliff . He tossed it out over the treetops , where it fell into a rhododendron thicket . No one would ever find it . <p> " Let 's go home , " he said . <p> Gabriel smiled . " Margaret Cully , " he said . <p> " Yeah , you 're gon na ride your ATV to see Margaret Cully , " the boy said . <p> They went down by the familiar gravel road , which the boy hoped was shorter than the way they had come . It was now late in the afternoon , and the sun was behind them , their shadows enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breath ragged and his knees popping . <p> Then they were at the paved road . Gabriel sat down . His sweatpants were wet across the bottom , and there was a dark patch between his shoulder blades where the sweat had soaked through his heavy jacket . It grew darker as the sun fell behind the mountain . The boy put the chair down and sat on it , his head level with Gabriel 's for the first time that day . <p> " Mama 's going to be coming home , " he said . <p> It was dark now when his mother came home . He was not wearing a watch , and it was hard to gauge the exact time with the mountain between them and the sun . <p> " She 'll be late , " Gabriel said . <p> " You better hope she is , " he said . " Get up . " <p> Gabriel moved his head from side to side , reminding the boy of the way a cow might regard him through a barbed-wire fence . His face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast white puffs . The boy realized that Gabriel was not going to be able to move for a time . He sat on the chair and waited for Gabriel to recover . A breeze came down the side of the mountain , rattling the leafless branches of the hickories . <p> " Cold , " Gabriel said . <p> " Walking 'll warm you up quick , " the boy said . <p> Gabriel got up , and they went along the road , the slight uphill grade causing him to breathe deeply again after only a few yards . But despite Gabriel 's complaining the boy managed to persuade him not to stop and rest . Once they stopped when the boy heard a car approaching . He hid the chair in the rhododendrons , and they stood together , Gabriel breathing hard , and waited for it to pass . <p> It was the hunters . The truck slowed down , and the passenger smiled and waved to them , but the driver just stared . The truck slipped slowly past them in the fading light , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grate of the shiny aluminum dog-box . Then the truck was gone , the taillights disappearing around a bend . <p> " Bears , " Gabriel said . <p> " Coons ! " the boy said savagely . " Or foxes . Maybe even just rabbits . You 've never seen a bear . You never will . " <p> " Up through the flowers . " <p> " You just keep on eating those big stacks of pancakes Mama fixes you . You 'll be bigger than any ole bear . " <p> The boy regarded the chair Gabriel now held in his hands , an alien thing , a mark set upon both of them . He wished he were standing at the edge of the cliff where he had thrown the come-along . He imagined the chair turning in the air as it fell , accompanied by wails from Gabriel , into the rhododendrons . <p> " Down in the rock , " Gabriel said . <p> " Yeah , " the boy said . " That 's where you 're gon na wish you were . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Gabriel shambled along at a slow but steady pace . And then to the boy 's amazement they were home and there was no sheriff 's car , its blue light flashing , sitting in the driveway . The house was dark . He hoped this was one of the nights when his mother was late . <p> Once the boy had hidden the chair in the garage storeroom , he went in and started a fire in the wood stove . Gabriel had disappeared . The boy walked down the hallway to Gabriel 's room . The door was open . Gabriel lay asleep on his bed , still dressed . The room was filled with the stink of Gabriel that the boy had smelled all his life , that was always on his uncle . It was a constant struggle for his mother to persuade Gabriel to bathe . <p> He went back out to the garage and took the chair out of the storeroom . He set it on the concrete floor and stood there and looked at it . <p> They 'll come here first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked up that hill . Is that enough ? <p> He went over their journey in his mind . The hunters , the come-along lying in the rhododendron , the shattered door . At any moment the lights from his mother 's van would fill the garage . He thought of the brick buildings of the state hospital standing in the valley among the leafless trees , the moonlight caught up in the razor wire . <p> My uncle , he thought . <p> It would be a long time before his stink would leave the bedroom . If Gabriel could just sleep the rest of the winter like the bear he claimed he saw , sleeping through the snow and rain , warm in a den hidden deep in a rhododendron thicket , and emerge thin and bright of mind from his winter 's sleep . And then he could walk or take a car to visit Margaret Cully , driven there by that force the boy did not understand , the same force that had made Gabriel climb the mountain . <p> He went into the storeroom and returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into lengths the same as the wood stacked in the garage . He liked the smell the wood made as he cut into it . Once he finished , he swept up the sawdust and put it in the trash can . Then he went into the house and fed the wood into the stove . It was clear to him now that his mother had to work late and that there had been no need to rush . The flames quickly died down in the stove , and soon there was only the red glow of the hickory logs through the window . <p> His mother called and asked him to fix supper for himself and Gabriel . He went into the kitchen to make macaroni and cheese but found that he was not hungry . He went to the living room to watch TV , but when he sat down and scrolled through the channels he found nothing to interest him . He turned the set off . From Gabriel 's room came the sound of snoring . He realized that burning the chair had been a futile gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gabriel , even with his help , had climbed the hill , and now the chair was gone . But Margaret Cully was still there . <p> We can live here , he thought . We 'll be fine here . <p> But he knew that was not going to happen . No matter where they lived there would be neighbors with things to steal , and girls . He imagined them living in some desert landscape , the only neighbors miles away , the only roads to their houses running over high mountain passes . They would never live in such a place . Gabriel was headed for the state hospital or jail . <p> Gabriel was muttering in his sleep . Then he was silent . The boy got up and walked to the open door of Gabriel 's room . Gabriel lay on his back , sleeping soundly and not snoring . His face was covered with sweat , for now the house had warmed up . <p> He went into the room and pulled off Gabriel 's gloves and knitted cap . He unzipped his jacket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down beside his uncle and pulled a blanket over them . It smelled of Gabriel and something else he could not identify , perhaps just the scent of old wool . He closed his eyes and waited for sleep . And then he was asleep until he was awakened by the sound of Gabriel 's voice . <p> " Down in the hole , " Gabriel murmured . Gabriel was still asleep . His face was dry and his breathing slow and relaxed . " Down in the rock . " <p> The boy reached out and put his hand on Gabriel 's big shoulder . <p> " A hole in the rock . " <p> Now sweat broke out on Gabriel 's face , and his legs moved as if he were struggling to climb a hill . <p> " Up in the flowers , " the boy whispered . " Up in the flowers . " Gabriel slipped back into a deep sleep . <p> The boy left the room and returned with the Bible his mother had given him on Easter . Then he woke Gabriel , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the pillow . But finally the boy got him out of the bed and into the living room . <p> " We 'll start with Genesis , " the boy said . " You could say that one perfect . You 'll be back on TV . " <p> " Ca n't , " Gabriel said . <p> " You got up that mountain . You can learn this book . It 'll be easy . You already know it . It 's inside your head . " <p> Gabriel placed both hands on the top of his head . " I can feel it , " he said . <p> " That 's right , " the boy said . " It 's there . Now listen close . You raise your hand when you need to let your brain rest . " <p> " In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth , " the boy began . " And the earth was without form , and void ; and darkness was upon the face of the deep . " <p> He read on while Gabriel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Joseph , filling Gabriel 's head with the words that might save him . <p> <p> By Scott Ely ch <p>
