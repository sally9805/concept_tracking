So with the ball in Van Gelder 's court , your editor began to riffle through the mental Rolodex , looking for suitable candidates to take on Mr. Ellison 's project . Otis Adelbert Kline never answered his email , but lady luck smiled on us and three of our top picks were able to schedule time to contribute a story . First up is Tananarive Due , an American Book Award recipient whose six novels include The Good House , The Living Blood , My Soul to Keep , and most recently , Joplin 's Ghost . Her last appearance in our pages was " Patient Zero " in the August 2000 issue and we 're pleased to welcome her back . Many of our early readers said this story was their favorite of the three takes on Lady Luck . <p> I HATE THIS PLACE . Someone got the idea - brilliant or inane , depending on how the meds are tickling my brain that day-to dress up this place with games . Someone thought the general air of Death might smell better with a whiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would be nice if someone could win something once in a while . That 's the idea . Brilliant or inane , it truly does not matter . You 'd have to live here to see the boldness of the notion . You 'd have to be breathing in the urinesoaked air . Picture Fidel 's worst prisons with festive shooting galleries not with real bullets , mind you , but pellets knocking over rows of smiling duckies - and maybe you would get the picture . Have I mentioned yet that I do n't like it here ? I hate this place . A few years ago , I could have sat you down over a few rounds of mojitos and sifted through other facts that could have been called pertinent , at least at the time : Bom in La Habana province outside of Mariel , Cuba . second of five children . Bank manager in Hialeah , Florida , for thirty years . Married twice , once happily . Widower twice , once unhappily . " Brace yourself : Only child , a son , died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defining fact of my existence . A whisper of my son 's death , and I got hisses , moans , blinking eyes , tears . I got laid , even . It was a powerful fact . That 's Gilberto . His son died . His only son . His namesake . ( Gilberto . Not Gil . Not Bert , for God 's sake . Gilberto . ) Gilberto lost two wives and a son , they clucked . What an unlucky man . Come to me , pobrecito . But before I came here , I was a virgin . I thought bad luck was a myth , and had vastly underestimated the phrase 's meaning in either Spanish ( mala suerte ) or the English I worked so hard to learn as a young man in my twenties , when I had to begin my life anew . Mala suerte . Now , I live in bad luck 's bosom . It suckles me to sleep - that , and the meds . Thank goodness for sleep . My only goal in life is more sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed next to mine , sleeps all day , the lucky bastardo . All day , and no one bothers him . No sleeping for me . When I first arrived , I got trotted around like a poster boy for recovery . Look at Gilberto , Mis . Sanchez . He bad a stroke only three months ago , and he can stand on his own two feet . Look at Gilbeito , Mi . Ortiz . He 's already feeding himself with both hands . Look at Gilberto , Mr. Benton . Look at Gilberto . The day of the stroke , I had a beautiful dream . No pain , just visions . One minute I 'm munching on pastelitos at my favorite Cuban bakery on Plagier , and the next minute I 'm at the emergency room . In my dream , I see my first wife , Maritza . The woman had a beautiful face , but I called her El Diablo . She was a horror . When I saw her again , I thought I must be on my way to Hell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unkind ? " And she shrugged her shoulders in her awkward , unrefined manner . " I did n't know how to be another way , " she said softly . Of course , no ? It made sense at the time , so I forgave her . Deep in my heart , I forgave her . I told her I was sorry for the way I danced when her headache turned out to be a brain aneurysm , my problems gone like that . And she smiled . Such a weight was lifted from me ! Then , her face became Camilla 's . Mi reina . Mi vida . Not as beautiful as Maritza - in her younger years , judged by her face , Camilla had been lonely - but I saw her clean , pure spirit . All kindness . And I understood : As in life , I had to pass my first test , Maritza , to see Camilla again . Perhaps it was Heaven calling for me . She touched my face , and an indescribable feeling bathed me . Better than sex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't find in this world . The next thing I knew , no Camilla . I was in a hospital room . I could not speak , I could not move the right side of my body . After an eternity , in answer to my prayers for a cessation of misery , I was brought here . So , either God has a grudge against me or has no better way to amuse himself . Either way , we do n't speak anymore . Was it not enough I was an exile ? Exiled first from my homeland , and next from my loved ones ? Did I ever complain ? When others would have cursed God , I never did . But for this place , God has some answering to do . There is no excuse . I hate this place . Here , we are not exiles , engineers , postal workers , grocers , bankers , grandparents , or deserted lovers . No - here , we are beds . Sixty beds . This is a place where people come to die when there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mongrels . Most of us are helpless to carry out even the most basic dignities of life , worse than babies . And someone of authority - the new administrator , or someone trying to impress him - looked out at this collection of sad human debris and said , " Ah ! Let the games begin . " So now , there is Bingo . B-I-N-G-O , like the gringo children 's song . I can hear you laughing , so you must get the joke . Bingo in Hell 's parlor . " You have a very bad attitude , Gilberto , " a young nurse , Antoinette , chides me . No one has taught her not to call her elders by their Christian names , but 1 tolerate this because she understands the words from my ruined mouth . My translator . " Quet Did I say anything ? " " You do n't have to say it . I see it in your face . They like the Bingo . Why come watch others play every day just to make fun ? You should play , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to watch the others play . Only a sadist would be entertained watching scarecrows listing in their wheelchairs , raising trembling fingers when they win , hardly realizing when they are wetting themselves . Does this sound like a sane person 's amusement ? Yet , it is true . I come every Friday . I wheel myself to the lounge by two P.M. without fail . I am the first one inside , the last one to leave . But I never win . Remember ? Mala suerte . Playing to win would be a waste of my time . I come for Her . My angel . Unlike me , she does n't come every week . Angels can not be summoned like pizza delivery , and I accept this . But the entire room changes when she walks inside . The light shifts to a bright golden hue , the exact color of twilight . The walls , which are usually growling at us with the promise of suffering , begin to sing . The first day I saw her , I admit it , I believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance , she seemed to be a typical nurse , invisible in a powder-blue uniform that would make any woman seem boyish , white shoes squeaking across the floor , and a name-tag that read ROSARIA . Her skin was browned with the echoes of an abuela negra whose African genes kinked her hair into tight brown ringlets she wore like a crown atop her head . Then I noticed her eyes . Dios mio , such eyes ! Beneath her luxuriant lashes , her eyes are black coffee beans , shining like the night itself . I saw her eyes from across the room , and they stole my concentration from the droning call of the Bingo numbers , my hand frozen above my cards . Her eyes held none of the dull dispassion or thinly masked contempt of the other nurses who occasionally gazed upon our pathetic game . Her eyes darted and dashed the way my little Gilberto chased our housecat to and fro when he was small , soaking up every detail about us . Instead of seeing only our tubes and wheelchairs , she lingered on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personhood . You can believe me or not , but I swear to what happened next on my dear Camilla 's soul : As soon as I noticed her eyes , I gained new eyes myself . Her image changed . I was no longer staring at a nurse in a uniform , but a visage who glided across the floor in a sheen of pale light . Floating , you see . Her hair was suddenly an impossibly long mane behind her , following her on the floor like a wedding train spun of dark lamb 's wool . She met my eyes and smiled at me . I have seen dying men resuscitated with electric shock , and that sensation can be no more jarring than her eyes . Her gaze shocked me back to life . No one else at the Bingo game seemed to notice her . Not Pedro , who breathed through oxygen tubes and coughed blood into his handkerchief , making such a racket that it was hard to hear the numbers - not Dixon Washington ( or Washington Dixon , I forget which ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards as if his neighbors could somehow cheat if they saw what Fate had dealt him - not Mrs. Martinez , who dressed up for Bingo games in her fading white lace dress and spring hat as if Bingo days were Easter Sunday - not Stella Rothman , a World War II widow who always cupped her ear to try to hear the numbers , complaining that her hearing aid was made in Japan and therefore was n't worth a damn and not Crazy Joe , who called Bingo ! every other number even though he was the only one with worse luck than mine . No one else glanced in the direction of this magnificent creature . Only me . To them , she was a nurse named Rosaria making an obligatory tour to see to it that no one dropped dead at a table . Such a death , after all , might ruin the game . But she is much more than a nurse . I know that now . Perhaps she is Oy herself . I have reasons for speaking so . I alone see her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perfect place for her to visit undetected . Bingo , you see , is not a game of skill , nor of will . There are no true choices - only luck . Each player is issued six cards , so in our game , anyone can expect to win at least once , even in a fellowship as cursed as ours . During the three hours we play , there are three or four winners . Sometimes more . Not me , of course - winning is not in my makeup - but usually . From time to time , even Crazy foe is right when he claims he has his Bingo numbers lined up . A broken clock tells the time twice a day , after all . So , I do not blame the others for not seeing it as I do . They would have to see her . The first day Rosaria arrived in the Bingo room - the first time her eyes gave me access to the truer vision of her - I watched her glide from table to table , pausing like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time , then moved to the next . And the next . With each person she passed , she seemed to be listening for something only her ears could discern . I watched her so closely that I lost my concentration , forgetting the administrator 's bored drone as he called the Bingo numbers . How I longed for her ! Not as a woman , mind you . I will confess she is beautiful - with a face that is fine-featured and yet ever-changing , with cheeks as hollow as an Indian princess in one moment and then as full as my Camilla 's in the next - but it was not her beauty that commanded my eyes . I have not known hunger in my loins since Camilla left this Earth , and my body no longer craves a woman 's touch . But as I watched her , even the first time , all of my heart cried out : Choose me . Bless me . Save me . Choose me . But she did not . Several minutes passed before she made her decision . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact moment : She took her hand and rested it across Pedro 's shoulder , her lithe fingers weightless . He was so intent on smothering his constant cough in his handkerchief that he never noticed the rare gesture of kindness . But I did . All at once , Pedro 's cough went silent . The visage was gone . And the nurse Rosaria , unnoticed , slipped away to her duties . But the change that came over Pedro ! Without his cough to bedevil him , Pedro sat straighter in his chair , with a young man 's posture . He marked his cards with fervor , his ears virtually twitching every time a number was called . His pencil flew . I heard him laugh to himself , a sound of boyish joy . On that day , as I witnessed the transformation , I believed the Bingo games were a brilliant stroke , and felt my faith in our caretakers renewed . I shared Pedro 's sudden belief that he could win , and that winning a simple game could matter to creatures such as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Pedro 's voice rose , silencing the room : " Biagol " he called through phlegm . Like a conqueror . He waved his card above his head . The prizes in our Bingo game are nothing to speak of . What is money to us ? The staff gives the winners little tokens-brightly wrapped sugarless candies , postcards of beaches and mountain ranges , photo frames in which to display the evidences of younger days on our nightstands - but winning the game meant everything to Pedro that day . His skin flushed pink . His eyes danced . I never heard him cough again the entire game . When he won the second time , he nearly leaped from his wheelchair . Pedro was not the only winner that day . But he was the only one chosen . That very night , you see , Pedro died in his sleep . His monitors made no sound to alert the nurses , and later it was discovered that his oxygen machine had been unplugged . His roommate , Ben Wallenbech , said he slept so soundly that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no outraged family to answer to , so the " investigation " amounted mostly to shrugged shoulders and shaking heads . Many speculated that Pedro himself had unplugged his oxygen . Those who had seen him at Bingo recalled his last moment of triumph , saying he chose death on that night because he wanted to leave this world on a winning streak . After that , I kept a special eye for the nurse , Rosaria . She frequently visited the Bingo games , but I never saw the amazing metamorphosis I saw the day she chose Pedro . I came to believe I had hallucinated , or perhaps that I 'd simply had a flash of premonition like my Ta Maria , the way I knew in my bones that my little Gilberto would not come home from football practice the night he died . A week after Pedro 's death , I suffered another stroke , one so minor that I did not notice it while it happened . But one morning I realized I could no longer stand and walk even the few steps I had mastered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To this day , whenever I try to stand , my legs tremble as if I have no bones . I can still mark the Bingo cards . But most days for a time after that , I only watched . Even the sight of Rosaria could not cheer me , because she never again appeared as she had that day , and I stopped believing in magic . I lost my spirit of play . Until a month passed . And everything changed . The Bingo game was flourishing . A male nurse named Jackson volunteered to be the new caller , and he was so animated that he might have been a preacher at a Baptist church . Jackson made all the difference . The sound of laughter regularly filled our tiny Bingo hall now , ringing through the hallways to the ears of those who were not well enough to participate . But I could not share their laughter . " Gilberto , your face is gon na be in a permanent frown if you do n't practice smiling again , " Antoinette told me as she wheeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't worry , papi . Your legs will grow stronger . " Such a sweet , young face to already be such a liar ! The truth is plain to me now . I believed their lies , even when I fought not to . No one here grows stronger . No one here gets better . And on that day , when I felt most mired in my helplessness , I saw her again . This time , I did not even see her as plain-dressed Rosaria , the nurse who came and went without notice . I saw , a shadow emerge in the doorway , impossibly long for the lighting from the hall , and at its tip was a large , winding spiral shape I could hardly make sense of . She followed her shadow into the doorway . This time , she wore her dark hair in thick , ropy shapes splaying from all sides of her head . The largest was an oversized , upright whorl the size of a python that looked as if it weighed several pounds . Her face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swampland mist , but how could I mistake her ? This time , I knew . My veins raced with adrenaline . " We got lu-cky number O- 72 , ya 'll . That 's the year the Dolphins went undefeated , so you know that 's lucky . You got O-72 , you 're a winner . " Jackson called on , unaware . She floated serenely down the rows of tables , toward mine . Something blocked my ears suddenly ; perhaps my heart itself , silencing everything except its own excited thrashing . If my legs had obeyed me , I would have stood up and fallen to my knees in her path . When she passed only a foot from me , I nearly pissed myself . I smelled Camilla 's favorite perfume in her wake , and tears came to my eyes . I opened my mouth to speak , but I had forgotten all language . " What 's that ? N-32 ? " Stella Rothman said , cupping her ear . " O-72 , " someone yelled . " Jesus , will you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid . " It 's my fault it 's made in Japan ? Not worth a damn . " The entity did not dally this time , as she had the first time I saw her . She went straight to Stella . She glided behind her , and laid her hand gently on Stella 's shoulder , her fingers like twigs . " Seventy-two ? " Stella said . " Wait a second . Just a second . " As she stared at her cards , light brightened her face , erasing her furrowed brow . She had told me once that her life ended the day the telegram from the War Department came ; I could n't remember the last time I had seen her smile . " Seventy-two ? I ca n't believe ... ! got it ! Bingo ! " Need I tell you ? It was only Rosaria who stood behind Stella then , stripped of her magnificent visage . Amidst the groans of disappointment from players who had not been as lucky as Stella , no one saw Rosaria lower her face , hiding her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nurse leave , back to her mundane duties . I was in a state that night , as you can guess . I had less appetite than even this food deserves . I could not sleep . Had I more control of my limbs , I might have taken myself to Stella 's room to watch her doorway . To see the outcome for myself . But in the end , of course , I already knew . Stella died in her sleep . There were no machines unplugged this time , and fewer questions . She was eighty-six , after all . When an eighty-six-year-old dies , it is n't a mystery . I wrestled with myself in the days to come , as anyone would . Should I report the girl , Rosaria ? And tell the administrators what , exactly ? That she touched the dying ? That she gave them one last smile ? That I suspected she was sneaking into their rooms at night ? Or that she was Oya herself coming to call , shepherding her chosen from one realm to the next ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloistered away from the raging world outside . That is why living here is worse than death , you see . Bingo for the damned ? The idea seems brilliant or inane to me , depending on how the meds are tickling my brain that day . I hate this place . " I 'll never understand you , Gilberto , " my young Antoinette says . " You complain about the Bingo game , but you 're always first at the door . " Of course I am , and now you see why . I no longer simply watch - I play . I listen closely , and I mark my cards when my numbers are called . I feel my heart leap as the rows fill . Because she is here today . Rosaria is here . She has not yet shed her human form , but I see the light glowing in embers from her skin . Her dainty nest of hair will grow . Her white nurse 's shoes are mewling against the floor now , but soon her feet will glide on the air itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer to me . Studying me . And I am a believer again . Perhaps my mala sueite is banished at last . Will my number come up this time ? Just this once , Rosaria - this one time - will you give me luck ? Will I win ? Bless me . Save me . Choose me.
