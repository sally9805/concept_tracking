A Tribute to the Late Greats of 2005 // Johnny Carson OCT. 23 , 1925-JAN. 23 , 2005 By Richard Lewis AMONG MY GENERATION OF COMEDIANS , getting on The Tonight Show was pretty much the only way that you could feel like you were successful . After my first appearance in 1974 , Larry David and I went to Macy 's to see what kind of impact it had . He walked behind me humming the Tonight Show theme like Doc Severinsen 's trumpet for about an hour . A few people looked at us like we should be institutionalized , and we got kicked out of the store . * I do n't care how many times you did The Tonight Show , when you were behind that curtain and heard Carson 's voice , you froze for a second . Sure , you could make it without Johnny , but that 'd be like Christopher Columbus trying to discover America on a raft . In the early ' ' 80s , I had this monologue about the Department of Motor Vehicles . I 'd done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to five and a half minutes . I went on , and it was getting such big laughs that it spread . The studio audience was too good . Suddenly , I 'm midway through and the stage manager is giving me the wrap-it-up gesture . I 'm thinking , If I end it now , it wo n't make any sense . But if I finish it , I 'll never get The Tonight Show again . As it turned out , I did almost 11 minutes . Clueless , my agents took me to the Palm to celebrate , but I was so depressed . Then it was like divine intervention from the comedy gods : There was Carson having dinner . I ran over to Johnny 's booth , got on my knees , and apologized . I said , " I did it out of respect for you and for comedy . " First he was startled . Then he started to smile . Then I saw the twinkle in his eyes . The next morning I got a call from the Tonight Show talent coordinator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When a joke bombed , that 's when Carson was actually the funniest . He rode that to comedy heaven . Everyone knows how hip he was : Like Superman , he could pop into that phone booth with his Midwestern boyishness and come out like one of the Rat Pack . But I do n't think people really know how genius he was at making every guest-even one hell-bent on sabotaging his or her career-look good . When someone was floundering , he mined it for gold . When someone was cookin ' ' , he was just an audience . Most hosts want their guests to succeed , but nobody more than Johnny Carson . Jay and Dave learned from the master , and they 'll admit it : No one will ever do this better . ( Carson died of emphysema in Malibu . ) Richard Pryor DEC. 1 , 1940-DEC. 10 , 2005 By Lily Tomlin I 'LL NEVER FORGET MY FIRST GLIMPSE OF RICHARD Pryor , on The Ed Sullivan Show in the late ' ' 60s , performing a fairy tale about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mesmerized by his heartbreaking wit , full of hurt and truth . Even then , his expression of personal experiences was unique-blending chaos and compassion , vulnerability and bravado , attitude and insight . I immediately wanted more than anything to work with Richard . So in 1973 , I developed a set especially for him , hoping he 'd see that I was a " white girl with soul . " Soon , Richard started talking about us working together , and he performed on my first two television specials that same year . How lucky I was to work with him . I was with Richard when Berry Gordy called to rave over his Oscar-quality performance in Lady Sings the Blues . Richard hung up and became that 6-year-old Primpce from the Sullivan show-shy , hopeful , and suddenly terrified , as if he had pulled off something he 'd never expected . That moment showed me the secret of Richard 's humor-the juxtaposition of his relentless , take-no-prisoners imagination with the poignancy of his poetic interpretation . He constantly tested the boundaries and seldom experienced internal limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost on him . The last time I saw Richard , I was in the audience at the Santa Barbara film festival honoring him for his work . For almost two hours , I watched the greatest pioneering comic artist of the last three generations at the top of his genius-this gifted , raging , soaring , plummeting , deeply human man with the tender boy inside . I wept and I laughed-inspired , moved , and grateful to have been present when this revelation , Richard Pryor , was so actively in our lives-and in our faces . ( Pryor died of a heart attack in Los Angeles . ) JOHNNIE COCHRAN Lawyer * 3.29.2005 " We 'd gone to the same barbershop in L.A. so I knew Johnnie when he was an assistant DA .

And she had that wicked sense of humor : It was n't a surprise to me that she and Mel Brooks married-of course she would marry that crazy man ! The first time I met her , I was auditioning to play Helen Keller in the Broadway production of The Miracle Worker . I was 12 years old and she was 29 . Part of the audition was to talk with Arthur Perm , the director , and the rest of it was to fight with Anne Bancroft . And so she came out of the audience up onto the stage , and Arthur would say , Now Helen does this , and teacher does that , and Helen does this , and then teacher smacks her-and Annie smacked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hit her back . There were two more auditions and fights . Then finally Arthur and Anne agreed that she and I could go toe-to-toe . Anne taught me-by example , not by lecture-the ethics and discipline of the theater . She was also one of the sexiest creatures that ever lived . Without being too obvious , I stole as much as I could from her behavior . ( Bancroft died of uterine cancer in New York City . ) Peter Jennings JULY 29 , 1938-AUG. 7 , 2005 By Tom Brokaw PETER 'S ILLNESS AND DEATH LAST SUMMER WAS a profoundly sad time for me , professionally and personally . We met in 1966 when we were in our mid-20s , and stayed in contact ever since . When ABC named him sole anchor of World News Tonight in 1983 , my wife and I threw a party for him , just as earlier this year , he and I threw a party for Dan Rather after Dan announced his retirement . There was a real brotherhood and very little jealousy among the three of us , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Often , when I was on a plane to some godforsaken place , I was looking over my shoulder to see if they were chasing me , or looking ahead to see if they were already there . Peter was uniquely stylish , possessing what I think of as anchorman lan . His studio skills were unmatched . He loved being in the middle of a great story : He was born to it , really-his father was a broadcaster . There were times when I 'd see him presenting fast-breaking information , providing context , asking the right questions , and my jaw would drop . I just do n't remember seeing anyone who had his combination of abilities . I do n't remember anyone with his verve . I know that Peter would have been touched by all the tributes , and I think he would have been a bit embarrassed , too . He was a tremendous journalist . Already since his death , stories have broken that have made me think , " Ah , Peter would have loved getting into that ! " ( Jennings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IBRAHIM FERRER Singer * 8.6.2005 " You could see by looking at this guy that he was somebody , like an aging cougar .

Thompson JULY 18 , 1937-FEB. 20 , 2005 By Lyle Lovett I WAS A JOURNALISM MAJOR AT TEXAS A &M,; SO Hunter was one of my heroes . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " list in his book Songs of the Doomed , I was stunned and honored . We became friends and stayed in touch . Hunter had a heart as big as the world . He knew the difference between right and wrong and loved to illuminate people who might be too much in the dark . He was genuinely thoughtful about people in his life ; he always demonstrated interest in what I was doing-he was like a great teacher . I never saw him live up to the antics you 'd find in one of his books , but he did n't mind courting that perception . He liked to play the outsize iconoclast , but not without purpose-he was very mindful of every step he was taking . He had fun , and there was always that glint of mischief . One time we were backstage and he found out our next show was in Salt Lake City . He said , " Well , you 'll need a pace car for that . You ought to buy my Cadillac . " I figured if Hunter S. Thompson offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do is ask him how much . He said , " Two thousand dollars , " and I paid him right there . There was a case of beer in the trunk , and he threw that in , too . ( Thompson died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in Woody Creek , Colo . ) August Wilson APRIL 27 , 1945-OCT. 2 , 2005 By Phylicia Rashad A LOVER OF LANGUAGE with a masterful understanding of rhythms in speech , August Wilson brought to the stage those lives that are typically regarded as dull and unimportant . In his way of thinking , every human being was endowed with dignity and , therefore , worthy of respect . His presentation was so authentically human . Within the context of his own ethnicity and cultural heritage , he posed philosophical questions : What does it mean to be free ? What is the individual 's responsibility to freedom ? And he offered an answer : Freedom is attained through the recognition of the deepest part of our selves . Inherent in this recognition is the experience of connection to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility to prepare the way-a good way-for all who will follow . Had he not written the cycle of plays , the people of Pittsburgh 's Hill District , the community in which he grew up , would have been forgotten . Remembrance was important to August , and it is important that he be remembered . ( Wilson died of liver cancer in Seattle . ) Luther Vandross APRIL 20 , 1951-JULY 1 , 2005 By Patti LaBelle I FIRST MET LUTHER MAYBE 40 YEARS AGO IN NEW York . I was playing the Apollo Theater with the Bluebelles and he came backstage and lied through his teeth : He said he was a designer delivering clothes to us . I knew that he was just a kid trying to get backstage so I let him come and meet us . After that , he became our fan-club president . He never made us any clothes , but over the years he did buy me truckloads of them-Gianni Versace dresses , beautiful earrings . I guess since he lied to meet me he was trying to make up for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supertalented singer when I met him . I did n't realize it until years later , after he started singing with Roberta Flack and David Bowie . Hard to believe , but that 's when I first found out Luther Vandross was that same kid who started out pretending to be a designer . I was just too happy for him when I realized it . We went on to become greater friends than ever . He would call me up when he was gaining weight : " Patti , I 'm going to the Fat Land . I 'm gon na have to take down a pair of these drapes and make me a suit ! " He had a great sense of humor . He was a real jokester-fun-loving , quick-witted . And always very kind to people .

" She was always such a lighthearted person on set , " adds Robert Goulet , her I 'd Rather Be Rich costar . " She was a sweet girl who went away too soon . " ( Dee died of kidney disease in Thousand Oaks , Calif. ) - Michelle Kung Saul Bellow JUNE 10 , 1915-APRIL 5 , 2005 By Jonathan Safran Foer SAUL BELLOW MADE IT ACCEPTABLE , EVEN fashionable , to write about American Jews as Americans , rather than as Jews . And it 's not only Jewish writers who should be grateful for that . And it 's not only Jews , either . But even more important than what he wrote about was how he wrote : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bellow wrote every sentence like it was going to be his last . In every paragraph one can find a reason to dog-ear the page . Sometimes I imagine his books singeing the covers of those they 're wedged between on the shelf . Behind that wild exuberance , which often takes the form of humor , is something very serious : an almost religious belief in language . We 've become so used to thinking of language as a vehicle ( for documentation , for storytelling ) that we too often forget about language as its own end-writing itself . Bellow wrote rhythmically , humorously ( even when he was n't making jokes ) , angrily , and ecstatically . He wrote joyously . He wrote with aims greater than entertaining his reader . He proclaimed , by example , that well-chosen words can shake us from our satisfaction and our certainty . And in a world that is increasingly satisfied and certain , we need him more than ever . ( Bellow died of natural causes in Brookline , Mass . ) Bob Denver JAN. 9 , 1935-SEPT. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilligan 's Island was lovable , wacky , and charming . You laughed with him and at him as he did silly things . He was curious like a child , playful and boyish . Children loved him , and families enjoyed watching him together . Bob 's mind was very quick-as an actor he talked very fast . But as a person , he was shy and introspective . He was my favorite person to work with . It was a joy for me to flirt with him , to try to charm him to do whatever I wanted-to help me get my way on the island or certainly to help me get off the island , which , of course , I never did . It 's amazing , the way the show has lasted and the pleasure we 've brought to so many people-it has taken a while to really grasp how much pleasure . Bob 's comedy was clever and fun , and will live forever . ( Denver died of complications from throat cancer surgery in Winston-Salem , N.C. ) Pat Morita JUNE 28 , 1932-NOV. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN my mind is this impish , entertaining spirit that also offered a lot of wisdom . He 'd seen the world from a lot of different perspectives . In the most straightforward , progressive way , he was happy to talk about everything , from racism to internment camps to playing in Las Vegas . To actually talk to somebody who , as a kid , had been in an internment camp , was , of course , startling . He 'd talk about the struggle , but he almost viewed it with a sense of achievement-the way he and his family got through it . Funny people have all kinds of things fueling them , and Pat was no different . On the Happy Days set he 'd be very quiet , off somewhere on the phone or reading the paper . Then he 'd be called in to rehearse one of his scenes and there 'd be this big explosion and suddenly he was Arnold-going " bah-ha-ha-ha , " running jokes , forgetting his lines , teasing people , and kidding with the writers .

( Morita died of complications from alcoholism in Las Vegas . ) Ismail Merchant DEC. 25 , 1936-MAY 25 , 2005 By Kazuo Ishiguro SINCE I MET HIM IN 1992 DURING THE MAKING OF The Remains of the Day adapted from Ishiguro 's novel , Ismail Merchant had become a close friend , often cooking dinner for my wife and me in his London apartment . He made himself the center of a large international circle of friends , relations , actors , technicians , cameramen , and writers . Of course , he was passionate about his films , but I always sensed that he made them in order to keep activated the relationships-the bonds of work and friendship and love-within this Merchant Ivory family . He was warm , effusive , but much more introspective and sensitive than people might guess from his showman exterior . It hurt him if a film received unfavorable notices or an actor or cameraman became disgruntled and left the fold . His last project as producer , The White Countess , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beset by many difficulties-political , cultural , financial-and he told me he 'd never been so stressed-out in his entire career . He was proud of the picture , busy working on it to the end . It 's very sad that he wo n't see the completed film . ( Merchant died of complications from an ulcer in London . ) Arthur Miller OCT. 17 , 1915-FEB. 10 , 2005 By Brian Dennehy THE ENORMOUS POPULARITY OF ARTHUR MILLER 'S plays-AZZ My Sons , A View From the Bridge , The Crucible , and many others-confounded many elitists , but for millions of people around the world they have been the very definition of art as a shared intellectual and emotional experience . But the surpassing importance of Arthur Miller lies not in the number of his plays or his passionate morality , or even in his brave and constant liberalism . His greatest gift to us was his poetry , his lyricism , the evergreen resonance of his writing . At the end of Death of a Salesman for which Dennehy won a 1999 Tony Award , Willy Loman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , real and imaginary . His old friend Charley speaks : " You do n't understand : Willy was a salesman . And for a salesman , there is no rock bottom to the life . He do n't put a bolt to a nut , he do n't tell you the law or give you medicine . He 's a man way out there in the blue , riding on a smile and a shoeshine . And when they start not smiling back-that 's an earthquake . And then you get yourself a couple of spots on your hat , and you 're finished . Nobody dast blame this man . A salesman is got to dream , boy . It comes with the territory . " Thanks , Arthur , for sharing your dreams .

We called Barbara " BBG " on the set . She was the mama figure .

People related to her because she was the epitome of compassion despite her own pain . Off screen , she was a pistol . She cussed like a mule skinner , and she really liked to have her drinks . But she also had an endless capacity to include everybody that she loved , and that was the entire cast .
