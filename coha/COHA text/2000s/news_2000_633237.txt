<p> There are times when it does n't pay to be Ben Affleck . <p> " You would n't want to be me in a male maximum security prison , " he says . <p> Imagine the looks Affleck got last winter when he spent three days at a Canadian penitentiary researching his convict role in " Reindeer Games , " opening Feb. 25 . <p> " You regret every beefcake still , " Affleck moans . " I saw my cover of GQ up on a few walls . " <p> One thing got him through the scary times : " I kept thinking about how my friend Matt Damon wore that green Speedo in ' The Talented Mr. Ripley . ' I thought , ' If the positions were reversed , he 'd be in real trouble ! ' " <p> Speaking of which , Affleck was almost in some dire straits when he decided to sleep over at the prison to get the whole authentic experience . But he was n't allowed to do that kind of time . <p> " The warden called me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these guys really liked you in " Good Will Hunting . " We 're worried if you stay over , you might be taken hostage . ' I said , ' Yes , thank you , I 'll be sleeping at home . ' " <p> Sequestered in a luxury suite at the Essex House , Affleck stares longingly out the window like he might want to stage a breakout . After all , it 's 7 o'clock on a Saturday night and the town is hopping . <p> " You know when I was in jail , most of the inmates had two questions : ' Did you sleep with Liv Tyler during " Armageddon " ? Are you still dating Gwyneth ( Paltrow ) ? ' " <p> He laughs . <p> " You know , prisoners and celebrity journalists have a lot in common . " <p> Affleck wo n't squeal . He will talk about his hot career , which finds him with two movies coming out this month within a week of each other . Opening Friday , there 's " Boiler Room , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a shady stock brokerage firm . <p> The following week , " Reindeer Games " opens . Affleck plays a con who gets out of prison and , through a case of mistaken identity , is taken hostage by a band of thugs . <p> " I think I 'm lucky , but I 'm not always happy . As far as fame and fortune go , I generally believe one should understand that none of it is deserved , " Affleck says . " Look , the phone stopped ringing for better actors than me . " <p> Affleck is driven , working virtually nonstop these days . <p> " I like quiet and the idea of rest , but I ca n't seem to stop moving , " he says . " The truth is , I do n't really feel like I 've made it , which is why I ca n't say no to things . " <p> Certainly that Oscar for " Good Will Hunting " helped . Did n't it ? <p> " I 've found it difficult to enjoy success , " Affleck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young , struggling actor you have to convince yourself that someday when you get to the point where you have money and roles , you 'll relax and be happy . <p> " But I 've got those things and now I 've found out something depressing . The struggle is more satisfying than getting what you want . It 's the struggle that makes you happy . " <p> In " Reindeer Games , " he is struggling . Affleck is in a prison riot one minute ; the next he 's shaking down a casino with guns and knives . Legendary director John Frankenheimer always wanted Affleck to play the lead . <p> " Ben was my first choice for this movie . We needed an everyman , " Frankenheimer says . " Most of all , I was looking for a young man who men could relate to and women enjoyed , too . I needed someone who was intelligent and a bit cocky . <p> " Ben reminds me of a young Warren Beatty . I worked with Warren when he was 27 , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good looking and talented , but they 're full of self-doubts . Warren did n't realize he was that good at that age , either . " <p> Affleck says he 's confused on several fronts . <p> " Now I 'm in a position where I can say , ' It 's either A or B , ' " Affleck says . " Sometimes the choices are really easy . Sometimes they 're really difficult . A movie you did n't do comes out and everyone really likes it and you 're like , ' Damn ! ' I guess I 'm the type who does think of the road not taken . " <p> Affleck was reared in Central Square , the non-affluent part of Cambridge , Mass . His parents divorced when he was a small boy and he turned to his best friend Damon , who lived a block away , for support . <p> Affleck was the first to get an agent and work on PBS and in local TV . The agent eventually signed Damon , and soon the boys were taking the train to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " School Ties " ( 1992 ) and " Dazed and Confused " ( 1993 ) . Meanwhile , he juggled college stints in Vermont and California . By his early 20s , he had hit rock bottom . <p> He had broken up with his girlfriend and was homeless . So he went to stay with Damon in a two-bedroom house in Los Angeles that they shared with another friend . In their spare time they wrote " Good Will Hunting " ( 1997 ) . <p> After several rewrites , a botched deal with Castle Rock and being told " no one will ever see this film , " Miramax picked up the project . Affleck and Damon went on to win best screenwriter Oscars . <p> International stardom was the door prize . <p> " Matt is Mr. Hollywood . I 'm still a guy from Boston , " Affleck teases . <p> Then Affleck sobers when asked how he has remained a nice guy . <p> " Why have n't either Matt or I become little terrors ? You have to figure in our personalities . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you , ' Oh you 're great . ' <p> " I ca n't imagine myself getting to the point where I 'm saying things like , ' This bleeping limo had better be a stretch ! ' In fact , Matt and I are constantly saying , ' Let 's scale things down . ' We look at each other and say , ' Man , I do n't care if it 's a limo . I 'm just glad I have a ride . ' " <p> Fame has been a bumpy ride . <p> " But if you put 100 people in a room and gave them adulation , money and attention , I bet about a third of them would turn into nightmares , " Affleck contends . <p> For a period of time , his own life was approaching scary territory . Every woman within a certain vicinity of Affleck was tabloid fodder . <p> " I swear there is some guy in L.A. who looks like me . And he 's dating all these beautiful women , " Affleck says . <p> He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close . " Yes , she 's " a wonderful actress . " <p> Clarence Williams III , who co-stars in " Reindeer Games , " comes the closest to ratting out Affleck on this topic . <p> " Ben 's lady Gwyneth flew in to see him all the time on the set , " Williams says . " They would be standing in the snow and tundra holding hands . People would gasp because it was like the Golden Couple had arrived . <p> " Standing there were two Oscar winners . They 're gorgeous . They have lots of money and fame . You almost wanted to bow to them . " <p> Affleck and Paltrow star together in the summer movie " Bounce , " a love story about survivors of a plane crash . It was n't easy work . Affleck moans that he had to get to that set early each morning because he spends part of the movie shirtless . A makeup artist had to cover his multiple tattoos . <p> " They had this huge flesh-colored spray paint . You just stand there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did Paltrow hold his hand ? <p> " The tattoo thing was a good lesson in decisions that have long-lasting repercussions . " <p> Like marriage ? Affleck almost chokes on his designer water . <p> " You have to make long-term decisions carefully , " he says . <p> And speaking of longevity , will Ben Affleck be around in 10 years ? That worries him the most . <p> " I do n't think you 've really made it until you can say you 've had career longevity . I want decades , " he says . <p> He would n't mind a few more awards , too . <p> " My Oscar is on a bookshelf in my apartment in L.A. , " he divulges . " I was going to slap it on the dash in my ' 69 Cadillac under the fuzzy dice , but I figured it would probably get ripped off . I imagined getting carjacked . " <p> Thanks to his time in jail , he 'd probably know the crook . <p> " I would be like , ' Buddy , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Take Matt . But could I please keep my Oscar ?
