Dear Dr. Cory : I have very sensitive hands , so whenever I swing on monkey bars , I get blisters right where my fingers connect to my hand . How does this happen ? How can I make them go away once I get them ? How can this be prevented ? Thank you for answering this as well as you can . Carlssa Johnson El Cajon , California Dear Carissa : Blisters occur when something rubs too much against your skin , as when your hands rub against the monkey bars . The best way to prevent blisters is to wear something that acts as a cushion between your skin and the object that you are rubbing against . To protect hands in situations like yours , try wearing a bandage or bandage tape at the base of your fingers where the blisters occur . Most blisters will dry up and peel off in one to two weeks . Applying a loose bandage over the blister will help to cushion it while it heals . Unless it is causing a lot of painful pressure , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can become infected . If the blister bursts on its own , keep it clean and apply a little antibiotic ointment such as Bacitracin . This will decrease the chances of infection and keep the skin soft . Cover the area with a loose bandage while the skin heals . Change the bandage twice a day and watch for signs of infection such as pus , redness or warmth around the area , and red streaks leading away from the blister . The skin should become tougher and no longer painful in three to five days . Areas of thick , protective skin called calluses often form on the hands and feet to protect skin that is frequently under pressure . Once your blisters have healed , you too will probably develop calluses if you often swing on the bars . Photograph // Dear Dr. Cory : I was wondering what makes your body fall asleep . If you can tell me , please write back . Jasmine Herringer St. Cloud , Minnesota Dear Jasmine : Our brain helps to regulate nervesignaling chemicals that make us feel sleepy or awake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain increases the amount of a chemical called melatonin ( mel-a-TONEin ) , which makes us sleepy . As our energy supply is used during the day , the body makes another chemical called adenosine . The more energy that is used , the more the adenosine increases . An increased amount of adenosine tells the brain it is running low on energy and it needs to decrease activity . As the amount of adenosine increases , we become more sleepy . Some people need more sleep because their body processes may require more time . So they need more sleep to rest and restore their body . When we do n't get enough sleep , we force the body to continue working with a decreased supply of energy . We become more drowsy , less alert , and decrease our ability to learn and make good decisions . Studies also suggest that not getting enough sleep weakens our immune system 's ability to fight diseases . According to the American Academy of Pediatrics , children ages five to twelve need ten to twelve hours of sleep each night . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity and metabolism . Teenagers need a good nine hours of sleep ! See you next issue ! Your friend , Cory SerVaas , M.D. Tips For Falling Asleep at Night * Avoid anything with caffeine , such as soft drinks , chocolate , tea , or coffee-especially in the afternoon and at night . * Stick to a regular bedtime schedule . * About thirty minutes before bedtime , plan a winding-down time that includes a warm bath , teeth brushing , and reading . * Use your bed just for sleeping . Avoid using it for doing homework or watching television . * Keep your bedroom cool , dark , and quiet . * If there is a stressful situation keeping you from getting a good night 's sleep , talk with your family about your concerns . * Exercise regularly . It helps you fall asleep faster and sleep more deeply . Sidebar Send your health questions to " Ask Doctor Cory , " Children 's Digest , P.O.
