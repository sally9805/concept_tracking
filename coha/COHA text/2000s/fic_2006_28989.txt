Secret Society Girl By Diana Peterfreund Random House Diana Peterfreund It all began on a day in late April of my junior year . I was in my dorm room , for once , trying to squeeze in a load of laundry between a tuna salad sandwich in the dining hall and my afternoon lecture on War and Peace , or as I like to think of it , WAP . ( That 's not an acronym , by the way , but onomatopoeia . It 's the sound the hefty volume makes when I drop it on my desk . ) Professor Muravcek's* lectures tended toward the impenetrable side and I wanted to spend some time brushing up on my notes . I was tilting toward a B in that class , which was unacceptable if I wanted to graduate with honors in the major . However , it was either laundry or rushing out that night to buy a new package of underwear . You know you 're desperate when trekking downtown to GAP Body is easier than waiting for a free dryer . But neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon . I 'd just finished disentangling my disentangling my fuchsia lace thong ( Friday night date panties ) from the legs of my " going out jeans " and was on my way out the door with a load of darks when the phone rang . Crap . It was probably my mom . She seemed to have a divine sense of when I 'd be in my room . I balanced the basket on my hip and picked up the phone . " Hello ? " " Amy Maureen Haskel ? " " You got her , " I said , shaking one of my balled-up gym socks free . " Your presence is required at 750 College Street , room 400 , at two o'clock this afternoon . " Two o'clock was in fifteen minutes . " Who is this ? " " 750 College Street , room 400 . Two p.m . " And then the line went dead . I plopped back onto the faded couch , strewing tank tops and pj bottoms across the floor . Talk about rotten timing . There was no question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the phone . Quill &; Ink was the " literary " senior society on campus , the usual refuge for scribblers of all varieties . It boasted several well-known writers amongst its alumni , and as the current editor-in-chief of the campus literary magazine , I knew I was a shoo-in , just like my predecessor Glenda Foster had been before me . That is , I would be if I made it to the afternoon 's impromptu interview . I was going to have to have a long talk with Glenda . She was in the Russian Novel class , too , and knew I was struggling , yet still scheduled my society interview during lecture time ! Society interviews were always arranged on super-short notice . Part of the test was to see if you could get there . I had n't yet figured out what they did if the prospective tap did n't answer her phone-if she was busy , for example , enduring both the crime and the punishment of Professor Muravcek 's soporific speaking voice . Laundry all but forgotten , I hurried back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formality , I fully intended to follow along with society pomp and circumstance and dress up . ( Societies are all about the spectacle . ) My suit was crammed in the back of my closet behind my ski jacket and the flared velvet getup I 'd worn to February 's seventies-themed Boogie Night . I had n't worn my suit since January 's spate of internship interviews , during which I 'd landed a posh ( insert eye roll here ) summer job xeroxing form rejections at Horton . It needed a good lint brushing , but otherwise , it was okay . I paired it with a fresh cotton shell , and went spelunking for a pair of panty hose sans runs . On the third dip into my underwear drawer , I found one . When , oh , when will I learn to throw away unusable nylons ? ( Not today , apparently . ) I stuffed the other two pairs back in the drawer and wrestled the third onto my legs . I needed to shave , but the nylons would cover that . In January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of those shoulder-length , multilayered bobs I was positive was the height of fashion for the Manhattan literati . ( It was n't . ) The downside of the cut was that , even with three months ' growth , it took twenty minutes with a blow dryer and a big round brush to make it look halfway decent . I did n't have that kind of time right now , so I was relegated to ponytail-ville . I slipped into my black pumps and clopped through my suite 's early Gothic-complete with lead-veined windows-common room . We have one of the sweetest setups in the whole residential college-two sizeable singles connected by a wood-lined common room that featured a non-working , but darn pretty , fireplace . Only downside is the slightly pockmarked hardwood floor . Have I mentioned how much I hate heels ? The door to the suite opened before I could turn the knob . My suitemate and best friend , Lydia Travinecek , entered , balancing an armload of dusty library books , a travel mug of coffee , and her dry cleaning . Lydia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for lunch , homework , and trouser pleats . It 's like she 's a lawyer already . She looked me up and down . " Quill ? " I shrugged . " Who else ? " Quill &; Ink was n't a secret society in the traditional sense . Heck , they did n't even have one of those giant stone tombs like the big societies used to hold their meetings-just a one-bedroom apartment above Starbucks . She nodded curtly , and flopped the dry-cleaning bags over the back of our couch . Two days ago , Lydia had hurried out of here in her own carefully pressed suit . " Good luck , not that you 'll need it . Has n't every Lit Mag editor gotten into Quill &; Ink since , like , the Stone Age ? " Pretty much . I pushed back the tiny thread of annoyance that Lydia had n't yet told me what society had been courting her . It was silly ; I knew that when Tap Night came around and she was picked by her society ( whatever one it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She took a paper sack out of her messenger bag and held up a bottle of Finlandia Mango in triumph . " Check it out . I thought we 'd go tropical with our Gumdrop Drops tomorrow . " Gumdrop Drops had become a weekly ritual in our suite since Lydia turned twenty-one last August ( I did n't go legal until December ) . A bottle of vodka , two shot glasses , and a bag of Brach 's Spice Drops to use as chasers were all we needed for a party . I wondered briefly what would happen to the tradition once we were both in our respective societies and had other obligations on Thursday nights ( all the secret societies meet on Thursdays and Sundays ) . " Awesome ! Ca n't wait . Got ta run . " I waved good-bye and clopped out of the suite , down the stairs , and into the sunny April afternoon . Connecticut had finally decided to get with the program and realize it was spring . I just knew Lydia would be tapped . She 'd been vying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment she 'd stepped on campus as a freshman . She honestly felt that it was the only way to get anywhere at this school . I thought the attitude was a bit out-of-date , myself . This was n't the twenties , when you were tapped into a society straight out of graduating from Andover or one of the other elite prep schools , and every student on campus was white , male , and rich beyond the dreams of avarice . In those days , failure to receive election into one of the big secret societies was tantamount to permanent social ostracizing . Forget the leather-furnished office on Wall Street , forget the vacation home in Newport . Your kids probably would n't even get into Exeter ! But the world did n't work like that anymore . Now most of the societies had diverse membership rosters that reflected a modern student body composed of kids from every walk of life . There was no doubt in my mind that come Tap Night , even without the benefit of blue blood , Lydia would be elected into one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Book &; Key . In fact , the only secret society I knew she would not get into was Rose &; Grave , the oldest and most notorious society in the country . But that was because all the members-known as " Diggers " - were men . As for me , I was joining Quill &; Ink for the same reason that I did everything else-it would look good on my resume . I was already well acquainted with the other literary types on campus . They were all my nearest and dearest . We did n't need the formality of a society like Quill &; Ink to cement our bond . What we did need was the networking and resume puffing it would provide us . You know how it goes . If there 's an organization to head , an award to win , a connection to pursue-you 've got to do it . Otherwise everyone would wonder why you did n't , and your whole carefully constructed C.V . of success would topple like a ninety-eight pound freshman at a kegger . This was it , 750 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a little over ninety seconds to make it into the room . And yet , when at last I arrived , slightly puffing , at the darkened classroom on the fourth floor , the first words out of the mouth of the person who laser-pointed me to my seat were : " You 're late . " I looked at my watch again , though I could n't see the hands in the dark . " I- " The shadowed man sitting at the nearest table pointed something at me that glowed with a green 2:01 in digital numbers . " This is an atomic clock . You were forty-eight seconds late . " " Are you joking ? " I squinted , trying in vain to see his face through the gloom . Since all of our classrooms are equipped with motion-detecting lights , I was surprised that they managed to pull this off . They 'd draped the windows with black hangings , and though each of the dozen people seated about the room appeared to have a book light in front of their place , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curve of a nose there . Wow , they 'd gone all out . Must be the writers ' creative juices at work . " Are we joking , Ms. Haskel ? " Shadow Guy #2 said with what I swear was a sneer . I did n't even need to see it . " Do you believe there is anything about this process that is a joke ? " Not until now . But come on , what was this , Eyes Wide Shut ? " No , sir . " I strained my neck to see if I could recognize Glenda 's features amongst the group , but I could n't make her out . Where was she ? Oh , let me guess . War and Peace . I was so going to swipe her lecture notes ! " Let me assure you , Ms. Haskel , " Shadow Guy #2 went on , " that we take our election procedure very seriously . Punctuality is of utmost importance to us . So is electing a person who can be trusted to obey the mandates of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Whoa . So forty-eight seconds and I 'd screwed the pooch ? I sat up in my seat . " I understand that , sir , and can assure you that I will take my position in the society very seriously . " I paused , weighing the advisability of my next words . " I did n't know I was supposed to invest in an atomic watch . Do I get one of those when I join ? " No answer . I giggled nervously . " What about a grandfather clock ? I heard every member of Rose &; Grave gets one at graduation . " Quill , however , did n't quite have the endowment for such lavish presents . Maybe they could swing a Timex . Still nothing . Um , was this thing on ? " Though I suppose that a grandfather clock would be hard to lug around . " Lame , lame , lame . " And probably not atomic . " Shut up , Amy . Man , I was crashing and burning here . We sat in silence for a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " Ms. Haskel , if you could answer a few questions for us . " I saw a shuffling of papers . " I have here your transcript . It states that sophomore year you received a B --  in Dust Pages : Ethiopian Immigrant Narrative of the Mid-20th Century West . " " Yes . " " Do you have an explanation for that performance ? " Yeah , beware of classes bearing colons . In this case , the prof was a prick who thought that everything in the text that was even remotely cylindrical was some sort of phallic representation , and unless our term papers explored the ongoing problem of feminine penis envy , we 'd completely missed the mark . I think he had bedroom issues . The B --  was my single black mark in my English major , or would be as long as I kicked all 1,472 pages of WAP ass in my Russian Novel final . " I 'm more of a New Critic than a Freudian analyst , " I began , choosing the time-honored liberal arts tradition of obfuscation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em . " The signifiers of the primary texts in the class " - man , even I did n't know what I was saying by this point- " lent themselves to readings more in keeping with the works of Said , Levi-Strauss , and . . . " Crap . I ran out of steam . Okay , pick an old standby . " . . . Aristotle 's theories as laid out in Poetics . " Ha , question that ! I was an English major . I could bullshit with the best of them . The third-row shadow smiled , and I could see that someone had a very talented orthodontist . His choppers were as bright and even as a movie star 's . " Good answer . " Then he cleared his throat . All the lights blinked on and off . Twice . Shadow-Who-Smiles shuffled a few more papers . " Do you remember Beverly Campbell ? " " My third-grade teacher ? " I 'd had to think about that one for a minute . Glenda had not warned me of any of this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes about the bleak Siberian winter in her usual purple gel pen . And here I was , getting grilled by Quill &; Ink for heaven knew what reason . Was n't I supposed to be a sure thing ? Furthermore , it was official : I did n't recognize any of these people 's voices . Had they brought in alumni to conduct the interviews ? " If we asked Beverly Campbell about you , what would she say ? " " That I was good with phonics . " Enough of this . " Come on , it was third grade . " " What about Janine Harper ? " Fourth grade . " Marilyn Mahan . " Fifth . " James Field , Tracy Cole , Debra Blumenthal . " Shadow-Who-Smiles proceeded to name every homeroom teacher I 'd ever had . It was more than a little freaky . " Can I ask you a question ? " I said , interrupting his recitation in tenth grade . " Go ahead . " " Congressional confirmation hearings would n't care this much about my early childhood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
