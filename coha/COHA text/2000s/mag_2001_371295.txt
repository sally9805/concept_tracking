Millions of Arabs and Muslims hold U.S. foreign policy responsible for the calamity of Sept. 11 . Is it ? The answer is : yes , but also no . <P> The yes has been widely articulated . Yes , there was and is a deep sense of frustration because of the bias shown by the U.S. to Israel and because of America 's cruel insistence on continued sanctions against Iraq . Plus , for historical reasons , Muslims and Arabs can always feel bitterness toward America : in the early 1950s , the CIA helped topple the elected government of Iran to reinstall the Shah . In the late 1980s , the U.S. left Afghanistan very messy after using it as a battleground against the Soviets . <P> But there is a no here as well , which has n't been voiced much in the Arab world . Certainly the international community has a responsibility to address the political grievances of Muslim societies , especially the Palestinian question , and try to reduce the poverty and inequality endemic in most of the Middle East . But no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muslim world as a whole rethinks its relation to modernity . Why is it that Africa , though poorer and more hurt by the West , did not create a terrorist phenomenon ? Why did Latin America export its " purest " terrorist product , Carlos the Jackal , to the Middle East ? <P> The reasons lie in the fact that we in the Muslim world have not been able to overcome the trauma caused by colonialism . We could not open up to the tools that modernity suggested , for the simple reason that they were introduced by way of colonialism . Our oil wealth allowed us to import the most expensive consumer commodities , but we could not overcome our suspicions of outside political and ideological goods : democracy , secularism , the state of law , the principle of rights and , above all , the concept of the nation-state , which was seen as a conspiracy to fragment our old empire . <P> A certain fixation on the past took hold alongside a deep uneasiness with the present . Religious reform did not take off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luther reformed Christianity ended at the turn of 19th century in disarray , opening the way to more extreme versions of the religion . Efforts to modernize the Arab language and bridge the gap between the spoken vernaculars and the written classical did not materialize . Public spheres  --  such as a free press , trade unions , civil societies  --  for debating matters related to the common good were not established . And most important , Muslims and Arabs never resolved the question of political legitimacy . They failed to develop workable models , which has made every attempt at political change long and dangerous . <P> The question of legitimacy is flagrant in Iran , where President Mohammed Khatami and his supporters won all the popular elections but could not win real power , which instead resides with Ayatullah Ali Khamenei . In Syria it seems there is no way out of Hafez Assad 's authoritarian legacy . If Saddam Hussein finally falls from power in Iraq , heaven knows who might replace him , so ruthless has he been in suppressing rivals . Yasser Arafat 's lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the peace process , so he instead alternates between directions .
