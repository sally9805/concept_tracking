It took nearly 400 years of constant observation ; here 's how astronomers finally cracked the secrets of Saturn 's rings . Photograph The Ringed Planet poses for the Hubble Space Telescope in October 1998 . Saturn 's thin rings , a mere 30 feet thick , are made of dusty water ice in boulder-sized and smaller chunks .

" HE WROTE THAT , " SATURN IS NOT A SINGLE STAR , BUT THREE TOGETHER , WHICH touch each other . With a telescope which magnifies 1,000 times , the three globes can be seen very distinctly , almost touching , with only a small dark space between them . " Galileo observed that Saturn 's appearance did not change over the course of more than a year . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolving around Saturn as Jupiter 's moons revolved around Jupiter , changes in their positions should have been noticeable every few days . Perplexed at Saturn 's peculiar appearance and anxious to work on other projects , Galileo stopped observing Saturn for over a year . When he returned to it in late November 1612 , he was astonished to find that the triple star had vanished ; only a solitary globe remained . " Now what can be said of this strange metamorphosis ? " he wrote . " That the two lesser stars have been consumed , in the manner of the sunspots ? Has Saturn devoured his children ? " Betraying a rare loss of confidence , Galileo wondered whether the ears had been " an illusion and a fraud with which the lenses of my telescope deceived me for so long - and not only me , but many others who have observed it with me ? " Nevertheless , Galileo predicted that Saturn 's companion stars would return in due course . They did . Galileo never solved the mystery of Saturn 's disappearing  --  reappearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in 1655 when Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens discovered Saturn 's sole large moon , Titan . Huygens saw that Titan revolved around Saturn every 16 days . From Titan 's orbital movements and Saturn 's motion against the fixed stars , Huygens concluded that Saturn was tilted more than 200 relative to the ecliptic ( the plane of Earth 's orbit around the Sun and nearly the same plane as Saturn 's orbit ) . The modern value of Saturn 's tilt is 26.730 , not too different from Earth 's tilt of 23.450 . Huygens assumed that Saturn 's handles were probably in the same plane as Titan 's orbit . Because the handles were closer to Saturn than Titan was , they should revolve around the planet in less than 16 days . Huygens reasoned that a broad , flat , homogeneous ring would not change its appearance as it revolved around Saturn . In addition , if the ring were very thin , it would seem to disappear when viewed edge-on from Earth . Huygens published a pamphlet in 1656 disclosing his discovery of Titan and including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three years later he published Systema Saturnium and included the solution of the anagram : Saturn had a " thin flat ring , nowhere touching the planet and inclined to the ecliptic . " In later years , Huygens used the ring hypothesis to predict Saturn 's telescopic appearance . As his predictions were verified , astronomers came to accept the idea of Saturn as a ringed planet . Their drawings showed a broad flat ring , just as Huygens had observed . This consensus lasted until 1675 , when astronomer Jean Dominique Cassini reported a dark line ( now known as the Cassini Division ) within the rings , dividing them into two segments - an inner ring and an outer ring . Rings , Ringlets , and Resonances Most observers agreed that the double rings were probably very thin ; otherwise , they would still be visible when viewed edge-on . But the question soon arose of how thin , solid rings could withstand the strain of being so near to Saturn . The dilemma was addressed by Cassini and others , who suggested that the rings were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moons or particles , each orbiting independently . Contrary to Cassini 's interpretation , the eminent German-English astronomer William Herschel declared the rings to be solid . Pierre-Simon de Laplace modified this suggestion and modeled the rings as a multitude of solid narrow ringlets , one inside the other , each orbiting Saturn at its own rate .

NASA , JPL // Over the following decades , observers reported myriad contradictory observations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark lines separating the rings , some three dark lines , others six . One team reported a " great number of narrow rings ... not unlike a series of waves . " The only new feature most observers recognized was a gap near the center of the outer ring discovered by Johann Encke ( and now known as the Encke Division ) . In 1850 astronomer William Dawes and the father-and-son team of William and George Bond discovered a faint third ring inside the other two . The new ring was called ring C , the middle ring ( the one planetward of the Cassini Division ) was called ring B , and the outer ring was called ring A. In 1852 a few astronomers reported they could see Saturn shining through the C ring , thereby providing strong evidence against Herschel 's idea of solid rings . Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell laid the idea of solid rings to rest in 1857 by demonstrating that any slight perturbation ( for example , by the gravitational pull of a small moon ) in the orbit of a solid ring would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet . This side would then be tugged on by Saturn to a greater extent than the opposite side of the ring and would drift even closer . Saturn 's gravity would accelerate the drift , and the closer part of the ring would crash into the planet . Maxwell concluded , " The only system of rings which can exist is one composed of an indefinite number of unconnected particles revolving around the planet with different velocities according to their respective distances . " But what causes the gaps in the rings ? In 1866 American astronomer Daniel Kirkwood had proposed that gaps in the orbital periods of asteroids were due to resonances with Jupiter . For example , asteroids that orbited the Sun twice for every single time that Jupiter orbited the Sun were in Jupiter 's proximity every second orbit . Gravitational tugs by Jupiter modified the orbits of these asteroids into ones of higher eccentricity . This resulted in a paucity of asteroids with these orbital periods . In 1867 Kirkwood proposed that the gaps in Saturn 's rings were caused by the same basic mechanism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , any particles that drifted into the Cassini Division would orbit the planet with a period one-half that of Saturn 's moon Mimas . The repeated gravitational tugs by Mimas would nudge the particles out of the division . During the following decades , observers made numerous contradictory reports of gaps in Saturn 's rings , many corresponding to resonances with Mimas . Kirkwood had predicted where the gaps should be , and observers , pushing the resolution limits of their telescopes , provided them in great numbers . Vanishingly Thin Theoreticians turned their attention to why Saturn 's rings were so thin . In 1920 British astronomer Sir Harold Jeffreys reasoned that the rings must be vanishingly thin . If Saturn had started out with a spherical swarm of particles orbiting the planet in every direction , mutual collisions would have caused the particles to lose energy . Each particle would tend to reach the average velocity of all the particles . Furthermore , a rapidly rotating gas giant like Saturn has a substantial equatorial bulge that distorts the gravity field and causes the plane of each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would tend to collide with other particles ; the result would be for the particles to achieve a circular orbit in the planet 's equatorial plane . In the absence of other forces , the ring would be one particle thick . The rings may have formed from particles around the planet that failed to accrete into a single substantial moon , or they may be debris created from a moon that disrupted . Because the ring particles are presently in coplanar circular orbits , when they occasionally collide , they do so at relatively low velocities . At these low velocities , substantial fragmentation is unlikely , and it seems possible that the particles could stick together and accrete into a moon . The reason they have not is because in orbits close to a planet , the difference in the gravitational pull by the planet on the nearside and the farside of such a moon would be great enough to tear the moon apart . These gravitational tugs are called tidal forces and although they can not pull apart small , tough objects such as rocks and orbiting spacecraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disrupt a liquid moon or a zero-strength conglomeration of rocks and dust bound together only by gravity . The distance at which the tidal forces will disrupt a liquid moon is approximately 2.5 planetary radii from the center of the planet . Most planetary rings are within this tidal stability limit , which is often called the " Roche Limit " after the French astronomer Edouard Roche , who first calculated this effect . At Home in the Rings Further advances in our understanding of the nature of Saturn 's rings were made in the late 20th century . In 1970 Earth-based infrared spectroscopy revealed that the rings were made mainly of water ice . In 1973 radar signals reflected off the ring particles showed that , on average , they are a few tens of inches in diameter . Close-up views of the rings were made by Pioneer 11 in 1979 and by Voyager 1 and 2 in 1980 and 1981 . The rings were imaged in stunning detail , revealing several surprising features including the observation that some ring particles are at least as big as a house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous ringlets . Five bands of ringlets flanked by dark gaps occur within the Cassini Division . The Encke Division has unusual ringlets that vary in thickness from one place to another . Although most rings are circular , there is a narrow eccentric ring close to Saturn , inside one of the gaps in the C ring . This ring is composed mainly of small particles revolving around Saturn in the same eccentric orbit . Some 2,500 miles ( 4,000 kilometers ) beyond the outermost major ring ( the A ring ) is the F ring ; this unusual ring varies in thickness from 20 to 310 miles ( 30 to 500 kilometers ) and appears to be composed of several small intertwined ringlets . The peculiar braided structure of the F ring is caused by the gravitational tugs of two small moons , Pandora ( 60 miles/90 kilometers in diameter ) and Prometheus ( 70 miles/113 kilometers ) , one on each side of the ring . Because the moons herd the ring particles and control their movements , they have been likened to two sheepdogs herding sheep and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences in the rings in these Voyager 2 portraits . The differences in composition come from different-sized particles , chemistries , and reflectivities of sunlight washing over them . NASA , NSSDC // A ring particle orbiting Saturn just inside the orbit of a shepherding moon goes faster than the moon and can overtake it . As it closes in on the moon , the moon 's gravity accelerates the particle forward . As a consequence of this increased velocity and the law of conservation of angular momentum , the particle moves into a larger orbit . After passing the moon and achieving a larger orbit , the particle is closer to the moon than it was before the encounter . The shepherding moon 's gravity tugs on the particle , giving it a backward acceleration ; the particle loses energy and thereby falls into a smaller orbit . The net result of these gravitational nudges is the apparently braided structure of the F ring . Two unusual rings occur beyond the F ring . The outermost ring is the 186,000-mile ( 300,000-kilometer ) - wide E ring , stretching between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's center to just past eight radii . The brightness of the E ring peaks sharply at the orbit of Enceladus at 3.95 Saturn radii . Ring particles consist mainly of micrometer-size blue spheroids ; these particles are so small that they would be dispersed by solar radiation pressure in a few tens of thousands of years . The rings therefore must have been produced in the relatively recent past . Because the brightness of the E ring peaks at the orbit of Enceladus , it seems likely that the ring particles were derived from this 310-mile ( 500-kilometer ) - diameter moon . The surface of Enceladus is made of water ice ; the low bulk density of the moon ( 1.2 grams per cubic centimeter ) indicates that Enceladus contains little besides water and ice . The lack of craters on Enceladus indicates that the surface is no more than a few hundred million years old and is possibly much younger . It seems plausible that liquid water from Enceladus 's interior flowed across the surface in the relatively recent past , erasing all preexisting impact features . This water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have speculated that an impact into Enceladus within the past fifty thousand years or so blasted water droplets into space . They would have frozen quickly into ice crystals . The drift of these partides through the Saturnian system produced the broad E ring . Between the F ring and the E ring lies the G ring , a tenuous 620-mile ( 1,000-kilometer ) - wide band composed primarily of millions of 0.5-millimeter-size particles . Because micrometeoroid bombardment and interactions with plasma in Saturn 's magnetosphere would erode the particles in a few thousand years , they must have been injected into this region over this timescale . Although no known moon occurs at this distance ( 2.8 Saturn radii from the planet 's center ) , a hypothetical source for the G-ring particles would be undetected moonlets , possibly house-size icebergs . In the words of John Milton , " every shepherd tells his tale . " But the complex dynamics of ring particles and the possibility of unknown shepherds around the giant planets also make the tale incomplete .
