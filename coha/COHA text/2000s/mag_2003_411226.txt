The best person to go to for parenting advice ? A mom who 's been there by Margaret Renkl // Sam , my easygoing firstborn , hardly ever cried as an infant and sailed cheerfully through the presumably-terrible twos without a single tantrum . But at 3 he became inexplicably possessed : " No ! " he shouted one day when I told him to pick up his Legos before putting in a video . " No ! " A Lego sailed through the air . It did n't hit me , but I 'm pretty sure it was aimed my way . Things went downhill from there . Insubordination at the breakfast table , sedition at naptime , slammed doors on the way to a time-out . I was bewildered : How could I wrest my angel boy from the clutches of misbehavior-inducing demons ? I did n't have an answer , but I knew where to find one . I called my friend Jess , the very personification of maternal patience and love , the role model I 'd been striving to follow my whole life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 3-year-old rebellion , just as she 'd known what to do about breastfeeding glitches and teething trauma . I had total faith that she could help me negotiate a cease-fire in the Great Sam Revolution . Sure enough : " Catch him being good , " she told me . " He 's getting lots of attention being defiant , so pay even more attention when he 's cooperating . He 'll like praise a whole lot better than he likes time-outs . " It worked . Later I gave Sam a big hug for taking his lunch plate to the kitchen without being reminded , and he was on his best behavior the rest of the day . Jess is more than just a font of motherly wisdom . Her store of benevolent compassion has gotten me through many moments of serious chagrin over the years . There was the time , for instance , when my second child , Henry , threw a tantrum at his older brother 's baseball game that was so passionate and clamorous , every adult in the ballpark was glaring at me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lashing out with his tiny 3-year-old fists . I felt completely defeated . The Department of Human Services might as well have come and taken him away . " I do n't think I 've ever even heard of a tantrum that bad , " I moaned later to Jess . " Oh yes , you have , " she said , reminding me of the time one of her kids threw such a fit in the grocery store that he threw up all over her . That image of the best mom I know covered with vomit while her normally gentle little boy howled like a rabid coyote in her arms-well , you can imagine how much better it made me feel about my own child 's outburst . New parents are never entirely alone . For guidance they can turn to their own parents , to books and magazines , to the pediatrician . But there 's nothing like a mentor , the kind of friend I have in Jess . When I do n't know how hard to come down on Sam , now 11 , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do about 4-year-old Joe 's fear of preschool , or whether to confront the kids in the neighborhood who call 6-year-old Henry " Shorty , " I phone Jess . If a mentor does her job right , though , the day invariably comes when the two of you begin to be on more equal footing . That day came for me when Jess 's third child developed colic . I called late one evening soon after the baby was born to see how things were going , but I could barely hear her over all the screaming . When I asked how long the crying had been going on , Jess sighed : " Twelve hours . Both of us . " I could n't make a colicky baby stop wailing , and with Sam still just a toddler needing constant supervision , I could n't even offer to give Jess a break while I walked the floor with the baby myself . But then it hit me : At least I could take Jess 's older kids off her worry list . So from then on , every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to the park to play with Sam . It was n't the fair trade I wish I could have found-we 'll never be even-but it was something . As much as I 've relied on Jess through these years of ear infections , potty training , childcare decisions , and playgroup negotiations , I have a feeling I 'm going to need her even more in the future , when the parenting problems get even thornier , the solutions harder to find . So I already know how I 'll respond if the day comes when I do n't like Sam 's prom date , or Henry is dying to backpack across Australia , or Joe wants to sit out a year of college to play in a rock band : I 'll call Jess . Jess will know what to do . Sidebar If a mentor does her job right , the day invariably comes when the two of you are on more equal footing .
