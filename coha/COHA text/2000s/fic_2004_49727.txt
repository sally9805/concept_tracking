YESTERDAY A FARMER WANTED ME TO FIND HIS LONG-DEAD DOG . Sixty years ago , when the farmer was fifteen , he 'd buried the dog , Patches , at a far corner of his family 's farm . <p> " That dog was the only critter ever loved me without a reason , " the farmer told me , pausing a long moment before adding , " People are critters , too . " <p> The farmer was ill and wanted to be buried with his dog beside him . I met him at his farm , and we walked beside an old fence line to a far corner of the property . He led me to a stand of apple trees beside a dry creek bed . Fallen fruit lay at our feet and the smell of sugary rot hung in the air . <p> " I never stopped thinking about that dog , " the farmer said . " I thought I 'd get old and he 'd go away ; life would hand me other things to think about . " <p> I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed me plenty to think about . Never stopped thinking about that dog , though . " <p> Disease had shrunken him and his overalls drooped in folds . It was n't unusual ; most people who call me are old , or sick , or both . He stood beneath the trees with his hands in his pockets and kicked at the dry land under his boots . I held my shovel and listened ; it 's how I always start . <p> " I nearly came looking for him a few times , " he said . " But it seemed like Patches was where he needed to be , underground , where it was safe . And if he was safe , well , I did n't want to mess with that . " <p> I wandered the area until something felt right , and I started digging . A few minutes later I knelt to finish with my fingers . There was little left , a brown skull laced with white roots , but the farmer cradled it in his hands as if it were the sole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much in my forty-two years . Rings . Watches . Lockboxes of letters . Last week I found a picture locket for a ninety-year-old woman . The heart-shaped locket revealed a fair-haired man who 'd died on a beach in France in 1944 . The man was smiling as if his life knew no horizons . The woman had buried the locket two days after his death and needed to touch it before she could acquiesce to hers . <p> I do n't know why I find things so long gone . Some people have perfect pitch , others draw with the accuracy of photographs . Maybe finding things is like that . <p> The first thing I found was a spoon . I was five and lived with my mother in a slouching shack on a tenant farm . My little cousin took the spoon outside and lost it . But it was n't just any spoon ; it was my great-grandmother 's baby spoon , the only object that followed our family from County Cork , Ireland . My mother spent days scratching through the weeds , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost us , she wept , and told me family stories that stretched thousands of miles , reciting long-dead names like holy writ . For days it was all she could do . I listened with a child 's ears and heard nothing beyond fairy tales . Still , the telling calmed my mother , and I ached for the spoon to return to her , to us . One afternoon a feeling took me and I bent and scraped the spoon from the dust . <p> Just like that . <p> One person believed I 'd found that spoon simply by wanting to : my mother . I ca n't recall her face very often , but when I do it 's shaped in that moment of belief when the spoon fell from my hand into hers . I found it , Mama . It called me . I have few memories of her after that ; another life came calling and she met it with a suitcase under her arm . <p> Today my client and I met along a road between farm field and forest . The sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's heat . A woman pushed from a tired sedan pockmarked with rust . In her late fifties , I guessed , wearing a flame-yellow dress cut too high at the bottom and too low at the top . Ice-pick heels punctured dirt with every step . Her hair was dusty straw , and her voice mingled hard with soft , like buckshot shaken through buttermilk . She pulled herself into my pickup and pointed down a dirt lane . We drove the rutted road and my picks and shovels clattered in the bed . She said , " Tell me about the first time you found something . " <p> " I was five . I dug up a spoon a couple weeks lost . " <p> " Two weeks ai n't nothing when it comes to time . A spoon 's no big deal , neither . " <p> " Depends on what it means to the one looking for it , " I said . <p> She stared at me a long moment and then waved me to pull over . " It 's around here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its point against the ground . <p> " Is it hard ? " she asked . <p> " A bit . But the rains have kept it- " <p> " Not the ground , you . Is it hard to be a person 's last hope ? " She leaned against my truck with arms crossed and hips pushed out like women I 'd seen on city corners late at night . <p> I said , " I do n't picture myself a last hope . " <p> The buckshot came to her voice . " I did n't want to call you , not at first . I heard about you from Junell Flanders at the women 's prison in Nashville . She knew a man who knew a woman you 'd found something for . " <p> " I do n't know Junell Flanders , " I said . <p> " She 'd heard of you ; that was enough . " <p> The shovel bit , lifted a clod ; nothing called from beneath it and I moved several feet . Her sad , buttermilky voice said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I could push it from my mind and never look at it again . " <p> I scratched the dirt a bit more , then rested the point of my shovel on the ground . " What am I looking for ? " I asked . <p> She said , " No rule says I got to tell you . You just find it . Is n't that what you do ? " <p> I shrugged and went back to digging . An hour passed and I had twenty shallow divots in the soil . " A little help here , " I said , raising an eyebrow her direction . <p> " You want to know what you 're looking for ? A soul . Maybe that 's what it is . " <p> My shovel faltered , then continued . " I 've never dug for a soul before . I 'm not sure I 'd recognize one . " <p> She dropped to her knees beside the hole and peered inside . " I do n't see it , " she said . " Keep digging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not here , " I said . <p> She laughed , cold and raw . " Like it was stolen , maybe ? No one 'd steal that soul , mister . Trust me . " <p> I dug until the moon rose bright and gibbous and my arms ached . " Let 's come back tomorrow , " I said , and went to my truck for a drink of water . When I returned she 'd gone . I saw her in the distance , moving quickly away , the yellow of her moonlit dress glowing as it disappeared down the lane . My voice seemed small when I called out to her , but she did n't turn . I started filling holes I 'd dug and a few minutes later heard her car start . I shrugged and began filling the last hole . When the shovel tucked into the mound of dirt I saw a glint of silver in the moonglow . Crouched , I whisked aside soil to find a spoon so small it did n't fill my palm from side to side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it a long time , then dropped it into my pocket and started to climb into my truck . <p> Suddenly-like guided by a map , or following a plumb line snapped tight between deep-sunk nails-I knew where my great-grandmother was . Where my grandmother was . <p> Almost . <p> I stood with my feet in the dirt and the moon so bright the ground seemed haunted by light . I remembered the names of all the faces in my mother 's stories and felt their weight like stones in my palm . Though it had long ago turned to dust , I smelled the split-pine walls of that shack and walked its sloping floor . <p> I finally understood where my mother was : in a rusty car on the road between hither and yon , closing on yon and atoning for hither . <p> Almost . <p> I touched the spoon through the fabric of my pocket , but something seemed wrong . Then I recalled how the old farmer held his dog tightest while it slept underground , and I dropped the spoon into the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knelt and buried it , leaving a soft hummock the rain would soon level . The moon burned white over my back as I drove away . <p> The spoon is underground again . Enflooded by roots and encircled by worms , it waits safely in the dark . No matter how distant I am in time or space , I will almost-almost ! - know where it is . A long time from now , perhaps , when years scythe hard against my days and time is measured from behind , I will return to find what I once found for others : pieces of the past awaiting those ready to understand . One last time my shovel will sift the darkling layers . I will kneel . I will touch bright metal . And for one still and ringing moment , I will know-beyond a doubt-where everything is . <p>
