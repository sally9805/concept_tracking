Chapter One HAPPY Birthday , Izzy . The big three-O . Terrific . Izzy felt her smile slipping and yanked it back with effort . Any minute now her face would start to crack . For what felt like hours she 'd laughed at the witty in-jokes , picked at the delicate and hideously expensive canapes and now she 'd had enough . If she did n't get out of here in the next five minutes , she was going to scream . Loudly . It was her thirtieth birthday , and she was at a party . Not her party , though , although it was in a way her celebration . No , this was a party to celebrate the phenomenally successful flotation on the stock market of yet another company she 'd rescued from certain death . Been there , done that , she thought tiredly , but everyone was on a high , and only a real party-pooper would n't want to celebrate with their friends . Friends ? She gave a quiet , slightly despairing little laugh . Apart from Kate , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year at the most . Were they really friends ? Or were they only there because of who and what she was ? And who was she ? She knew what she was , and if she ever lost sight of it , the press would lose no time in reminding her with one of the selection of nicknames they thought so amusing . The Stripper , TheAssassin - Godzilla was the latest in a long line . And all because she went in where angels feared to tread , and restructured ailing companies , turning them around and pointing them in the right direction . And , of course , because she was a woman , and because she was so young , she 'd attracted a lot of attention in doing it . More , really , than was warranted . Plenty of people did what she did , but not many , she was forced to admit , with such startling results . She 'd been lucky - very lucky . Her instincts had only let her down once , and the press had loved it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runaway success , and she knew she 'd never need to work again . She would , of course , simply because if she did n't work , then what would she do with her life ? Without work , it was empty . Barren . Nonsense , she told herself . You 've got a great apartment overlooking the river near Canary Wharf , a fantastic assistant in Kate , you can have anything you want - except privacy . That was the penalty . She had more appearances in the society rags than the average royal , every date she went on was turned into a full-blown affair - which was a joke , because most men were so terrified of her they 'd run screaming before they got to her bedroom door - and she was standing there surrounded by people who did n't even know her . Heavens , I do n't know me . Where are my real friends ? Do I have any ? " Excuse me , " she murmured with a vague smile , and headed for the ladies ' loo . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced at Kate , her right-hand-woman - and the closest thing she had to a real friend - and dredged up a smile . " Yes , I 'm fine . " " Great party . They 're a super bunch - I 'll miss them . Still , there 's always the next lot . " She fell into step beside Izzy , going with her into the cloakroom , chatting to her over the top of the cubicles so even that moment of respite was denied her . She was wondering where on earth she could go to be alone when Kate erupted out of the cubicle and joined her at the washbasins . " So , how 's the birthday going ? I remember being thirty . Shattering . I went on the internet - that website for contacting old school-friends and so on . Found out what they were all doing . Weird . " She chattered on , telling some involved story about a couple who 'd rediscovered each other through the internet , but Izzy was n't listening any more . Her attention had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was miles away . Light years . Twelve , to be exact , up in Suffolk in the long , glorious summer between leaving school and going off to uni , camping by the river in a field owned by Will 's parents , all of them laughing and telling jokes and chasing each other around in the long , sweet grass , full of the joys and without a care in the world . Where were they all now ? Rob and Emma and Julia and Sam and Lucy - and Will . Her heart lurched . Where was Will ? He 'd kissed her there , down by the river in the shelter of the willows . That had been their first kiss - the first of many that blissful summer , and a prelude to more than kisses . Much , much more than kisses , she remembered with a pang of longing . And then she 'd gone to university , driven by the need to get on with her life , and he 'd gone away with Julia and Rob and Emma , travelling around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year with news that had shattered her dreams . Her friend Julia , with whom she 'd shared everything - including , apparently , Will - was pregnant with his child , and he loved her and wanted to marry her . Her world had fallen apart that day . She 'd spent the next few years reconstructing it brick by brick , until the wall she was hiding behind was so high nothing and no one could get over it . She had n't seen him since . Where was he now ? What was he doing ? Was he still with Julia ? And the child - a girl or a boy ? Had there been others ? Little dark-haired boys and girls with his quick wit and sparkling eyes , and a smile that left her breathless ... A familiar ache of longing settled in her chest , and she dragged in a deep breath and forced her eyes to focus . Her reflection stared back at her solemnly and did nothing to improve her humour . Mouse-brown hair , curly on a good day and like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicate highlights to give it a bit of lift and stop it looking like an old pan scourer , topped a face set with dull grey-green eyes splodged with brown . A kind person would call them hazel . Her mother called them muddy . Small , even features did nothing to draw attention to her , but at least she supposed she was n't actively ugly , and her smile , when she could be bothered to produce it , was OK . She practised it fleetingly , and scowled . OK ? Just barely . ( Continues ... )
