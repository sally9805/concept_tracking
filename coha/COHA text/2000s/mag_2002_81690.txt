Once upon a time , a tortoise challenged a hare to a series of hockey games . The hare said , " You 're kidding , eh ? I 've got it all . I 'm headed to the Bunny Hall of Fame , and my legendary coach is already there . I 'll sweep the floor with you . " The tortoise was n't very experienced , but it had an ace up its carapace  --  the neutral-zone trap . The tortoise would turn the series into an obstacle course , grab some fur to rein in the hare , and if the hare was napping , die tortoise might do some damage and win a couple of matches . This is a bedtime version of the 2002 Stanley Cup finals between the Detroit Red Wings ( hare ) and the Carolina Hurricanes ( tortoise ) , and it raises one question : Are the Hurricanes capable of turning what appears to be a mismatch into a competitive series ? // The Cup finals will not be a skillathon , like Detroit 's epic seven-game victory over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best series you 've ever seen , " Brett Hull of the Red Wings said afterward ) , but a series in which mere will be few goals and fewer style points . By committing to a 1-2-2 forecheck that forces an abundance of turnovers , and by tidying up rebounds that goalie Arturs Irbe occasionally leaves like crumbs along a fairy-tale trail , the Hurricanes can make heavily favored Detroit sweat . Even during their series against the Avalanche , the Red Wings were aware of Carolina , having watched the Hurricanes gradually dismantle the Toronto Maple Leafs in six games in the Eastern Conference finals . " Me and Steve watched a few of the Carolina games together , " Hull says of captain Steve Yzerman . " We looked at each other and said , ' These guys are a whale of a team  --  pardon the pun . ' The Carolina franchise used to be the Hartford Whalers , until it moved in 1997 . They 're young . They 're strong . They 're enthusiastic . They 're disciplined . " This is no goober @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially on the wings . Sami Kapanen , second-line rookie revelation Erik Cole and mainstay Jeff O'Neill are quick enough to back off the Detroit defense , which survived a few shaky moments early against the Avalanche . None of the Hurricanes forwards , however , are game-breakers in the way Yzerman , Hull and Sergei Fedorov are for the Wings . Using the trap is fine , but no team since the 1995 New Jersey Devils has won a Cup thriving on turnovers alone . Hurricanes defenseman Aaron Ward , who was a regular for Detroit from 1996-97 through 2000-01 and could have changed his first name to Damn considering the abuse he took from coach Scotty Bowman , has not seen this much talent coming at him on a regular basis since practices in Detroit last year . Ward , who was traded to the Hurricanes , will have to contend with an even more powerful arsenal now : Last summer the Wings added Hull and 590-goal scorer Luc Robitaille. // The pressure will fall on the 35-year-old Irbe , literally the last man standing . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who still stands up , plays angles and kicks out rebounds . For him every night is That ' 70s Show . He 's so old-fashioned , he patches his own equipment . Irbe 's gear , especially the trademark white pads that repel pucks as if they were Flubber , is older than some of Toronto coach Pat Quinn 's grudges . " Archie looks at it this way , " says Carolina 's goaltending consultant Don Edwards . " You have an old pair of shoes , they feel comfortable . Why switch to a new pair when the old ones still fit ? " Hurricanes coach Paul Maurice did some switching of his own early in the postseason , yanking a shaky Irbe in mid-game during consecutive first-round losses to the Devils and replacing him with backup Kevin Weekes . " I was low for a brief moment , " Irbe says . " Then I said , ' Screw it . ' What can you do ? I was n't going to lose any more sleep . " // The benching  --  or " adjustment , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irbe wonders , even if he 's loath to admit it . Maurice reinserted Irbe in Game 4 of the conference semifinals against the Montreal Canadiens soon enough that his confidence was not shattered . His play against Toronto , in which he allowed only six goals , none of them during five-on-five , compares favorably with his performance in leading the San Jose Sharks to a colossal first-round upset of Detroit in 1994 . " They have very strong goaltending in Irbe , " Wings associate coach Dave Lewis says . " He 's almost invincible at times . " // The first appearance in the finals for the Hurricanes was a vindication for Maurice , who was 19 in 1986 when the franchise last won a playoff series . He 's the NHL 's youngest coach  --  in his seventh season at the helm , he 's also second in tenure behind Scotty Bowman , who 's been with the Wings for nine years  --  a survivor worthy of his own show . Maurice 's job was hanging by a thread last December after Carolina lost four straight games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score of 19-7 . But the Hurricanes won in Florida on Dec. 8 , starting a streak of four wins in five games . Maurice , whose teams had won only four playoff games in his first six years and who was atop everybody 's next-coach-to-be-fired list , solidified his job and found a way to implant the seed of defensive accountability and make it the hallmark of a team that had been searching for an identity for years . // The Hurricanes ' charge through the East  --  they won six of nine road games ( including all three Game 6s ) and six of seven overtime matches  --  was not a shock as much as a reaffirmation of the system and of the young talent brought in by general manager Jim Rutherford . " This is not just a team that 's going to be good for a short stand , " says center Rod Brind'Amour . " We 've got a chance to always be good . " // The Carolina draft of 1998 wo n't rank with the alltime haul the Wings made in ' 89  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicklas Lidstrom , who won the Norris Trophy last season ; hard-hitting elite defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov ( he retired after a debilitating limo accident six days after Detroit won the Cup in ' 97 ) ; and three others still in the league-but it laid a solid foundation with forwards Cole , Josef Vasicek , Tommy Westlund , Jaroslav Svoboda and its No. 1 pick , Jeff Heerema . Heerema , who was dominant while playing for Lowell of the American Hockey League this season , is expected to compete for a job on one of Carolina 's top two lines in 2002-03. // Cole , as part of the BBC line with Brind'Amour and Bates Battaglia , has been the playoff prize , a blossoming power winger with speed and an unfettered willingness to crash the crease . " That Cole , " says Wings defenseman Mathieu Dandenault , " likes to get his nose dirty . " Cole , 23 , could be a 30-goal linchpin within two seasons , but he 's not the most talented young Hurricanes forward . Svoboda , 22 , has a chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need . Svoboda , who was n't recalled from the minors until March , has the best hands on the team and can stickhandle in a phone booth . With the 6 ' 4 " , 200-pound Vasicek , 21 , eventually developing into a No. 1 center and 21-year-old defenseman David Tanabe , an Astaire on skates who has not played since breaking his right wrist in Round 1 , Carolina will no longer be a playoff interloper but a postseason fixture . " Look at that 1998 draft , " Ward says . " It 's one of those things that you have to be impressed with . A lot of times teams try to replace components with players they buy . " // The bad old days of Hurricanes hockey , when the radio broadcast of a Detroit-Carolina game in 1999 was aired on tape delay because East Carolina was playing in the Mobile Alabama Bowl , are history , as fans flock to the sport that is the NASCAR of the North . They might need a rabbit 's foot against a team with nine future Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hurricanes have come out of their shell . ?
