<p> Mulch is n't exactly the sexiest garden subject . It 's usually made of dead and decomposing things . But mulch helps keep everything around it healthy , and that 's important to a beautiful garden . <p> Mulch , simply put , is a layer of any number of materials that gardeners and landscapers put down on top of soil . <p> In the vegetable and flower garden , a 3-inch to 4-inch layer of mulch discourages weeds by forming a dark barrier under which seeds do not germinate and those emerging soon perish . <p> Because mulch prevents sunlight from reaching and heating the soil , it slows evaporation . That means less water is needed when temperatures are high . <p> Soil beneath the mulch does not dry out and crust , and that reduces the need for cultivation . Mulch protects the soil from blowing away or , during a heavy rainstorm , from splashing up on plant leaves and fruit . <p> Some mulches contain nutrients that trickle into the soil . Organic mulches gradually decompose and at season 's end can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gardens to improve texture . <p> Homeowners usually look to a layer of bark chunks or colored gravel to make patches of bare ground in their landscaping more attractive . But a well-chosen layer of mulch does much more . As in the garden , it conserves moisture and reduces weed growth and soil erosion . <p> Wide temperature swings in our climate stress many trees , shrubs and ornamental plants . Periods of alternating warm and subfreezing temperatures in midwinter send mixed signals about whether it 's time to grow . A 3-to-4-inch layer of mulch will keep frozen ground from premature thaw , and tulips will not try to bloom in February . <p> Most mulches used for landscaping stay in place for years and are appropriate for use around trees and shrubs , on berms and over patches of bare ground . <p> The materials include various forms of bark and wood , gravel and stone , heat-treated clay aggregates and shredded tire rubber . A sheet of weed-barrier fabric is often placed under these materials . In unplanted areas , black polyethylene plastic may be used instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mulched at planting time , but established trees also benefit . The mulched area should extend to the drip line of the branches , or at least cover a 4- to 5-foot-diameter area around the trunk . The larger the mulched area , the more beneficial it is . In lawn areas , a mulched area around the base of trees and shrubs makes mowing easier and helps prevent mower damage . <p> Mulches never should be placed closer than 6 inches to the base of woody plants . In summer , mulch piled up against the stem or trunk allows moisture to build up , creating ideal conditions for insect pests and diseases . In winter , thick organic mulches may harbor rodents that will chew on the bark of the plants when other wildlife food sources are covered with snow . <p> Gardeners in this area are rarely successful in producing melon crops because they like hot weather and need a long growing season to produce mature fruit . Stretching a sheet of dark plastic film over the melon bed , and taking a few other steps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production of tomatoes , peppers , eggplants , okra , cucumbers , squash and pumpkins . <p> Grass clippings <p> Never use clippings that have been treated with an herbicide , including ' weed and feed ' products . Even small amounts of chemicals can kill or damage your vegetable plants . <p> Dry out the clippings first or spread a layer of fresh clippings about 1 inch deep in the garden . Add more layers each week . It 's best to mix in compost or chopped leaves to prevent the clippings from packing down , which , in turn , prevents water from penetrating to the soil . <p> Dried leaves and <p> plant material <p> Chop fallen tree leaves and plant debris in a backyard chopper-shredder before spreading in the garden . Do not include plant materials with seeds . Unchopped leaves blow away or become matted , but they can be used for mulch if composted over the winter . Layer on this mulch 4 to 6 inches deep . <p> Pine and other <p> conifer needles <p> Dropped evergreen needles can be an attractive mulch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Running pine needles through a chopper-shredder makes them easier to spread and blunts their sharp points . Because of their density , a 2- to 3-inch layer is adequate . <p> Sphagnum peat <p> Peat is usually mixed into the soil to improve its texture , but it also can be applied to the soil surface as mulch . Compressed blocks of sphagnum need to be moistened before the material can be spread , otherwise it will blow away . ( Cut a slit in bag 's side , fill with water from your garden hose and let stand overnight . ) Its drawback is that it crusts on the surface as it dries , making it difficult for water to penetrate . <p> Newspaper <p> Three to six sheets of newspaper provide a good , one-season weed barrier around vegetable plants . Newspaper should be laid over drip or soaker hose irrigation lines . If you place the hoses on top , poke holes through the paper to allow water to get through . This may allow for some seed growth . <p> Anchor the newspapers around the edges so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves or grass - on top makes it more attractive . Never use newspaper pages with red ink or from slick color inserts . <p> Sawdust <p> Aged or partially rotted sawdust lasts a long time in the garden . Because it is prone to caking , apply it only 2 inches deep . Also , because of its high carbon-to-nitrogen ratio , scatter a nitrogen fertilizer over the soil before spreading the sawdust . For every 100 square feet of mulched area , add 2 pounds of a complete fertilizer , such as 10-6-4 , or 4 pounds of ammonium sulfate . <p> Compost <p> Compost is an especially good mulch , even when its ingredients are only partially decomposed . It has fertilizer value and is a good organic amendment for tilling into the soil after the growing season ends . <p> Straw and hay <p> Available in bales at livestock feed stores , straw sometimes is used on garden paths and between plant rows to keep mud off shoes . Hay is more expensive but brings more nutrients to your garden . But beware , straw and hay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetables , and they blow away easily . Straw and hay should be applied to a depth of 4 to 6 inches . <p> Wood <p> Bark chunks , shredded recycled wood and composted wood mixes are available at garden centers and landscape materials suppliers , but less-attractive varieties - wood chips recycled from Christmas trees and storm debris - are free to whoever hauls them away . Most Front Range municipalities offer this material to residents . <p> Because of the high carbon-to- nitrogen ratio in wood mulches , scatter a nitrogen fertilizer over the soil before spreading the mulch . For every 100 square feet of mulched area , add 2 pounds of a complete fertilizer , such as 10-6-4 , or 4 pounds of ammonium sulfate . Never use a ' weed and feed ' type fertilizer around trees or in other planted areas . <p> Gravel and stone <p> Place these products in unplanted areas because they hold heat and may raise soil temperatures enough to damage plant roots . <p> Rubber <p> Shredded recycled rubber is available in several colors . It is used extensively in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , industrial sites and along highways . <p> Evergreen boughs <p> These trimmings provide winter protection for somewhat tender perennials , as well as insulate the ground from premature thaw . Lay them over the beds after the first signs of frost in the soil and remove as growth starts in the spring . <p> Plastic film <p> Black polyethylene is the primary type used by commercial growers in cold-climate states . It warms the soil , controls weeds and prevents soil water loss and nutrient leaching . Clear plastic warms the soil better than black but allows light to penetrate , in turn allowing weeds to grow underneath . <p> Infrared-transmitting , or IRT , plastic is a ' hybrid ' that allows the infrared portion of the light spectrum through but does not allow light for weed growth . <p> An alternative to plastic is a black biodegradable paper that breaks down in the middle of the growing season . <p> The soil must be prepared for planting , and drip- or soaker- hose irrigation must be installed before the plastic is laid over it . It should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The plastic should be anchored with rocks or ground staples . <p> Red plastic <p> Scientists at the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Agricultural Research Service found that red plastic mulch boosted tomato yields up to 20 percent . Besides conserving water and controlling weeds , the red plastic reflects higher amounts of certain growth-enhancing light waves from sunlight . <p> In three years of field tests , red mulch boosted tomato size and weight by increasing the plant 's growth above the ground , especially in the fruit . It also improved strawberry flavor when used on strawberry beds . The mulch is available from garden centers and seed houses . <p> ' Living ' mulch <p> A wide variety of low-growing ornamental plants can act as mulch . Creeping juniper , ivy , creeping veronica , mat thyme , creeping phlox , periwinkle , and several kinds of grass are but a few of the choices . Survey the growing conditions before you select a plant . <p> A ' living ' mulch will not give you all the benefits of a conventional mulch . Once established , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeds . It likely will be more attractive than bark or gravel . <p> A plant called hairy vetch has been used to boost tomato yield in commercial growing tests . <p> Hairy vetch ( Vicia villosa L. Roth ) is a winter annual legume planted as a cover crop in the fall to reduce soil erosion while transferring nitrogen from its roots to the soil . In the spring it is tilled into the soil as a green manure , adding organic matter and nutrients . <p> Hairy vetch can be sown on a raised bed where tomatoes are to be grown . At planting time , cut or pull out the vetch and leave it on the bed . Tomato seedlings can be planted through the mulch into the soil . <p> In late summer , seed hairy vetch at the rate of 1 1/2 ounces per 100 square feet . A nitrogen inoculant should be mixed with the seed the first time vetch is planted on a site . Scatter the seed and cover lightly . <p> Hairy vetch emerges within a week , then grows 5 inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . In winter , it turns purple and flattens to the ground . In early spring it resumes growth . <p> Sweet corn , snap beans , pumpkins and other large-seeded vegetables also can be planted through the vetch mulch . For small-seeded vegetables , transplants are easier to establish in the mulch . <p> Duane Davidson is a Colorado State University Cooperative Extension master gardener in Jefferson County .
