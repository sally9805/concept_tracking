MY grandfather , who lost his short-term memory sometime during the first Eisenhower Administration , calls me into his study because he wants to tell me the story he 's never told anybody before again . My grandmother , from her perch at her beauty table , with the oval mirror circled by little bulbs I used to love to unscrew , shouts , " Oh , for God 's sake , Seymour . We 're meeting the Dewoskins at Twin Orchards at seven-thirty . Must you go back to the South Pacific ? " My grandfather slams the door and motions me to the chair in front of his desk . I 'll be thirteen in two weeks . " There 's something I want to tell you , son , " he says . " Something I 've never told anybody . You think you 're ready ? You think you 've got the gumption ? " " I think so . " " Think so ? " " I know so , sir . I know I 've got the gumption . " He sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gleaming letter opener in the shape of a miniature gold sword . " So , you want to know ? " " Very much . " " Well then , stand up , sailor . " My grandfather 's study is carpeted with white shag , which feels woolly against my bare feet . I twist my toes in it . Many cactuses are also in the room . My grandfather often encourages me to touch their prickers to demonstrate how tough an old boy a plant can be . My grandfather captained a destroyer during World War II . " It was late , " he says . " Someone knocked on my stateroom door . I leaped up . In those days I slept in uniform-shoes , too . " My grandfather smiles . His face is so perfectly round that his smile looks like a gash in a basketball . I smile back . " Do n't smile , " he says . " Just because I 'm smiling , do n't assume I could n't kill you right now . Know that about a man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my grandmother protests through the door . " Is n't he supposed to be at summer camp , anyway ? Call his mother . " He looks straight at me and snarls at her , " Another word out of you , ensign , and I 'll have you thrown in the brig , and you wo n't see Beanie Dewoskin fill V-J Day . " " I 'll make coffee , " my grandmother says . " It was late , " I say . " Someone knocked . " " Two knocks , " he says . " And by the time he raised his knuckle for the third , I 'd opened the door . " A message from the watch , sir . A boat , sir , three miles due north . Very small , sir . Could be an enemy boat , sir ; then again , it might not be . Hard to tell , sir . ' I told the boy to can it . Some messengers do n't know when to take a breath and let you think . They think if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , which is never true . Remember that . I went up to the bridge . Wait , ' I told them . Wait fill we can see it . And ready the torpedoes , ' I told them , or something like that . I forget the lingo . " " The torpedoes ? " I say . " Yes , " he says . " The torpedoes . I could n't see it clearly , but the chance that it was n't a hostile boat was slim . You see what I 'm driving at ? " " I do , sir . " " No , you do n't , sailor . " " No , I do n't , " I say . " Do n't at all . " " We 'd been warned in a communique from the admiral to be on high alert for kamikaze flotillas . Do you have any idea what a kamikaze flotilla is ? " " Basically , " I say , " it hits the side of your boat , and whango . " " You being smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death we 're talking about here ? " " Sorry , sir . " " So I waited . It took about a half hour on auxiliary power for us to get within a quarter mile of the thing-then I could see it with the search . " My grandfather pauses and then opens his right-hand desk drawer , where he keeps a safety-locked pistol and a stack of tattered pornographic comic books . They are strange books . In the cartoons men with long penises with hats on the ends of them and hair growing up the sides , so that to me they look like pickles , chase women with skirts raised over their heads and tattoos on their asses that say things like " Uncle Sam 's my Daddy " and " I never kissed a Kaiser . " He whacks the drawer shut and brings his hands together in front of his face , moving his thumbs around as if he 's getting ready either to pray or to thumb-wrestle . " Japs , " he says . " Naked Japs on a raft . A raftload @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call them refugees , but back then we did n't call them anything but Japs . Looked like they 'd been floating for days . They turned their backs to the light , so all we could see was their backsides , skin and bone fighting it out and the bone winning . " I step back . I want to sit down but I do n't . He stands and leans over his desk , examines my face . Then he points at the door and murmurs , " Phyllis does n't know . " On a phone-message pad he scrawls " BLEW IT up " in capital letters . He whispers , " I gave the order . " He comes around the desk and motions to his closet . " We can talk in there , " he says , and I follow him into his warren of suits . My grandfather has long ago moved all his clothes out of my grandmother 's packed-to-the-gills closets . He leaves the light off . In the crack of sun beneath the door I can see my grandfather 's shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was working on his putting in the driveway . Photograph // " At ease , sailor , " he says , and I kneel down amid the suits and dangling ties and belts . And I see now that it 's not how many times you hear a story but where you hear it that matters . I 've heard this before , but this is the first time I 've been in a closet alone with my grandfather . " Why ? " I say . " Why , if you knew it wasn't- " " Why ? " he says , not as if he 's repeating my question but as if he really does n't know . He sighs . Then , still whispering even though we 're in the closet , he says , " Some men would lie to you . They 'd say it 's war . I wo n't lie to you . It had zero to do with war and everything to do with the uniform I was wearing . Because my job was to make decisions . Besides , what the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? There was a war on . " " But you just said  --  " " Listen , my job . Just because men like me made the world safe for men like your father to be cowards does n't mean you wo n't ever blow up any civilians . Because you will . I do it once a week at the bank . " He places a stumpy , powerful hand on my shoulder . " Comprende ? " " Never , " I breathe . " Good , " he says , and we are standing in the dark and looking at each other and the story is the same and different  --  like last time except this time his tears come so fast they 're like lather . He blows his nose into his hand . I reach and offer him the sleeve of one of his tweed jackets . " I 'll let myself out , " he says , and leaves me in the confessional , shutting the door behind him . I do n't imagine anything , not even a hand that feels like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seymour ? Seymour ? " my grandmother says . " Where 's the kid ? " <p>
