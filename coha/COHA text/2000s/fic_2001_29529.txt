THE AIR WAS MOIST , THE COMING RAIN telegraphed by plump , gray clouds , and the blue sky fast fading . The 1936 four-door Lincoln Zephyr sedan moved down the winding road at a decent , if unhurried , pace . The car 's interior was filled with the inviting aromas of warm sourdough bread , baked chicken , and peach and cinnamon pie from the picnic basket that sat so temptingly between the two children in the backseat . Louisa Mae Cardinal , twelve years old , tall and rangy , her hair the color of sun-dappled straw and her eyes blue , was known simply as Lou . She was a pretty girl who would almost certainly grow into a beautiful woman . But Lou would fight tea parties , pigtails , and frilly dresses to the death . And somehow win . It was just her nature . The notebook was open on her lap , and Lou was filling the blank pages with writings of importance to her , as a fisherman does his net . And from the girl 's pleased look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch . As always , she was very intent on her writing . Lou came by that trait honestly , as her father had such fever to an even greater degree than his daughter . On the other side of the picnic basket was Lou 's brother , Oz . The name was a contraction of his given one , Oscar . He was seven , small for his age , though there was the promise of height in his long feet . He did not possess the lanky limbs and athletic grace of his sister . Oz also lacked the confidence that so plainly burned in Lou 's eyes . And yet he held his worn stuffed bear with the unbreakable clench of a wrestler , and he had a way about him that naturally warmed other 's souls . After meeting Oz Cardinal , one came away convinced that he was a little boy with a heart as big and giving as God could bestow on lowly , conflicted mortals . Jack Cardinal was driving . He seemed unaware of the approaching storm , or even the car 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel . The tips of his fingers were callused from years of punching the typewriter keys , and there was a permanent groove in the middle finger of his right hand where the pen pressed against it . Badges of honor , he often said . As a writer , Jack assembled vivid landscapes densely populated with flawed characters who , with each turn of the page , seemed more real than one 's family . Readers would often weep as a beloved character perished under the writer 's nib , yet the distinct beauty of the language never overshadowed the blunt force of the story , for the themes imbedded in Jack Cardinal 's tales were powerful indeed . But then an especially well-tooled line would come along and make one smile and perhaps even laugh aloud , because a bit of humor was often the most effective tool for painlessly driving home a serious point . Jack Cardinal 's talents as a writer had brought him much critical acclaim , and very little money . The Lincoln Zephyr did not belong to him , for luxuries such as automobiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The car had been borrowed for this special outing from a friend and admirer of Jack 's work . Certainly the woman sitting next to him had not married Jack Cardinal for money . Amanda Cardinal usually bore well the drift of her husband 's nimble mind . Even now her expression signaled good-natured surrender to the workings of the man 's imagination , which always allowed him escape from the bothersome details of life . But later , when the blanket was spread and the picnic food was apportioned , and the children wanted to play , she would nudge her husband from his literary alchemy . And yet today Amanda felt a deeper concern as they drove to the park . They needed this outing together , and not simply for the fresh air and special food . This surprisingly warm late winter 's day was a godsend in many ways . She looked at the threatening sky . Go away , storm , please go away now . To ease her skittish nerves , Amanda turned and looked at Oz and smiled . It was hard not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he was a child easily frightened as well . Amanda had often cradled her son when Oz had been seized by a nightmare . Fortunately , his fearful cries would be replaced by a smile when Oz would at last focus on her , and she would want to hold her son always , keep him safe always . Oz 's looks came directly from his mother , while Lou had a pleasing variation of Amanda 's long forehead and her father 's lean nose and compact angle of jaw . And yet if Lou were asked , she would say she took after her father only . This did not reflect disrespect for her mother , but signaled that , foremost , Lou would always see herself as Jack Cardinal 's daughter . Amanda turned back to her husband . " Another story ? " she asked as her fingers skimmed Jack 's forearm . The man 's mind slowly rocked free from his latest concocting and Jack looked at her , a grin riding on full lips that , aside from the memorable flicker of his gray eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amanda thought . " Take a breath , work on a story , " said Jack . " A prisoner of your own devices , " replied Amanda softly , and she stopped rubbing his arm . As her husband drifted back to work , Amanda watched as Lou labored with her own story . Mother saw the potential for much happiness and some inevitable pain in her daughter . She could not live Lou 's life for her , and Amanda knew she would have to watch her little girl fall at times . Still , Amanda would never hold out her hand , for Lou being Lou would certainly refuse it . But if her daughter 's fingers sought out her mother 's , she would be there . It was a situation burdened with pitfalls , yet it seemed the one destined for mother and daughter . " How 's the story coming , Lou ? " Head down , hand moving with the flourishing thrust of youthful penmanship , Lou said , " Fine . " Amanda could easily sense her daughter 's underlying message : that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Amanda took it as good-naturedly as she did most things having to do with her volatile daughter . But even a mother sometimes needed a comforting pillow on which to lay her head , so Amanda reached out and tousled her son 's blondish hair . Sons were not nearly so complex , and as much as Lou wore her out , Oz rejuvenated his mother . " How 're you doing , Oz ? " asked Amanda . The little boy answered by letting out a crowing sound that banged off all sides of the car 's interior , startling even the inattentive Jack . " Miss English said I 'm the best rooster she 's ever heard , " said Oz , and crowed again , flapping his arms . Amanda laughed and even Jack turned and smiled at his son . Lou smirked at her brother , but then reached over and tenderly patted Oz on the hand . " And you are too , Oz . A lot better than me when I was your age , " said Lou . Amanda smiled at Lou 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to Oz 's school play , are n't you ? " Lou said , " Mom , you know he 's working on a story . He does n't have time to watch Oz playing a rooster . " " I 'll try , Amanda . I really will this time , " Jack said . However , Amanda knew that the level of doubt in his tone heralded another disappointment for Oz . For her . Amanda turned back and stared out the windshield . Her thoughts showed through so clearly on her features . Life married to Jack Cardinal : I 'll try . Oz 's enthusiasm , however , was undiminished . " And next I 'm going to be the Easter Bunny . You 'll be there , wo n't you , Mom ? " Amanda looked at him , her smile wide and easing her eyes to pleasing angles . " You know Mom would n't miss it , " she said , giving his head another gentle rub . But Mom did miss it . They all missed it .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
