<p> Saturn 's 2003 Ion sedan is the nicest rental car you 've driven in a long time . Oh , that 's probably too harsh , but it has that rental-car aura . <p> The four-cylinder engine  --  goodness . There are quieter , nicer-sounding lawn tractors . <p> And the plastic body . After 12 years , Saturn has n't figured out how to make doors sound solid or fenders feel robust . A crash-worthy steel structure underlies that plastic , so flimsiness is an illusion . <p> And the styling has n't evolved . Ion 's a blocky , even ugly , sedan . Nothing exciting . <p> So implausibly , Ion is likable . <p> Perhaps it 's because you just want to like Saturn , with its no-haggle pricing , or that dent-fighting plastic body , or its heroic attempt to bring something fresh to parent General Motors ' largely stale car lines . <p> Likely it 's due to the unseen advances Saturn has packed into Ion , the first car built on GM 's so-called Delta platform , foundation for small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which means the suspension need n't compensate for a chassis that 's flexing over bumps . Thus , you get both a pleasant ride and decent handling . <p> Delta 's a bit larger than the platform used for the S-series Saturns that Ion replaces , allowing more room inside and an especially big trunk . <p> Delta incorporates high-end electrical systems , so a lowly Ion can offer upscale features : <p> * Electric power steering . It causes no drag on the engine because it is n't driven by an engine belt , so it improves fuel economy 0.7 of a mile per gallon , Saturn calculates . It 's also easy to tune , so it can provide more or less assist , based on likely preferences of buyers of various versions of Ion . <p> It seemed to need unusual force from the driver in tight corners to get the midlevel Ion 2 test car to do what the driver intended . Otherwise , it felt good . <p> * Speed-sensitive wipers . They move faster as the car does to keep up with the increased intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Programmable power locks . You 're not stuck with some engineer 's idea of when to automatically lock and unlock the doors . <p> Delta also accommodates premium hardware , so Ion can offer a five-speed conventional automatic transmission and will offer a continuously variable automatic transmission ( CVT ) on the coming coupe . <p> The test car 's five-speed automatic was n't the sweetheart it should have been , however . Upshifts were a bit like lunges from gear to gear . Downshifts seemed better , even hard-throttle kickdowns that cause other cars to pause before downshifting . <p> Other salients from the test drive : <p> * Seats . Cloth models in the test car look grim but sit good . That 's unusual in low-end cars . <p> * Power . The nasty , bellowing four-banger hauls tail pretty good if you can abide the sound . <p> * Center-mounted gauges . In Ion , they are easy to read and seem almost conventional . That 's the best job yet in making it seem reasonable to put the speedometer , tachometer and other readouts atop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gauges are high enough and angled properly so they take just a glance down and over to realize that your speed is too high or your gas is too low . Still , it takes awhile to get into the habit of looking over , not down . <p> " We did it to give an upscale , fresh look , " says Jim Ulrich , in charge of Saturn 's small cars . A practical advantage : Moving the instruments from behind the steering wheel means Ion does n't need a big wheel to keep gauges visible . " It let us open up the interior , use a smaller steering wheel for more legroom , " he says . <p> * Price . Ion starts at a tempting $ 11,995 , but the good stuff such as anti-lock brakes and air conditioning  --  stop us if you 've heard this one  --  are extra . Saturn predicts most Ions will be $ 14,000 to $ 16,000 , suddenly not so cheap . And the test car , outside that range at $ 16,780 , still did n't seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to friends and expect to get the " oohs " and " attaboys " you might with a $ 17,000 Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla . That is until you demonstrate how much more power Ion 's engine delivers . <p> * Simple things , done well . That 's what so many car companies have abandoned and what Ion embraces . That 's probably why it seems somewhat attractive despite the flaws . For example : <p> You adjust air vents by moving them  --  what a concept  --  not via some thumbwheel or push-pull gizmo . <p> You tune the radio by turning a knob . How refreshing not to cycle through a menu for a simple task . <p> You get in and out by opening the doors wide . Oh , you 'd be surprised how many cars make you squeeze through a needlessly narrow opening . <p> You grab hold of a steering wheel that 's firm and covered in something far from fancy leather , but feels grippy and accommodating anyway . Most plastic wheels are nasty to grab . <p> You plop your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , closer than most cars provide . <p> Silly , is n't it , to champion such banality ? But too many planners , thinkers and marketers have forgotten how important such trivialities are to overall satisfaction . Saturn not only has n't , it 's managed to dress up the package of necessaries with curves and ovals to remove them from the mundane category . <p> The question about Ion is n't whether it 's an improvement over the S-series . It is . The question is why , for all its modern underpinnings , Ion does n't come across as refined and as pleasant as similar-price cars wearing Japanese brand names . <p> 2003 Saturn Ion <p> * What is it ? Successor to Saturn 's long-running S-series small cars . Ion is a small , front-wheel-drive , four-door sedan , manufactured at Spring Hill , Tenn . A so-called quad coupe with stubby , rear-hinged back doors is due late next spring . <p> * How soon ? On sale now . <p> * How much ? Base model , called 1 , starts at $ 11,995 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 , starts at $ 13,995 . Top model , 3 , is $ 15,495 . Five-speed automatic transmission adds $ 900 . <p> Dealer costs are available at Edmunds.com and other car-shopping Web sites . Saturn is a no-haggle brand , though , so expect to pay about sticker price , Edmunds says . <p> * What 's the powertrain ? 2.2-liter , four-cylinder engine rated 140 horsepower at 5,800 rpm , 145 pounds-feet of torque at 4,400 rpm ; five-speed manual transmission . <p> * What 's the safety gear ? Conventional belts and bags are standard . The good stuff  --  anti-lock brakes , head-curtain air bags front and rear  --  costs extra . <p> * What 's the rest ? 1 has power steering , brakes , P185/70R-14 Firestone tires on steel wheels . <p> 2 adds or substitutes air conditioning , power locks , AM/FM/CD stereo , 195/60R-15 Firestones . <p> 3 adds or substitutes power windows , remote-control locks , cruise control , 205/55R-16 Firestones on alloy wheels . <p> * Who 'll buy ? 40-year-olds making $ 50,000 a year , as likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have college degrees . <p> * How big ?
