Now that Botox has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration , fans of cosmetic quick fixes are buzzing about the next miracle injectable . It 's Restylane , a synthetic hyaluronic acid that , like collagen , can fill in facial lines and plump up lips . It 's already a hit in Europe and Canada , though its maker has yet to seek approval in the U.S. But last week it completed its U.S. clinical study , and the results were impressive . Restylane outperformed a collagen-based substance by a 6-to-1 ratio . Unlike collagen , which lasts only about three months for some patients , Restylane can last six months or longer , doctors say . And because it 's a non-animal-based gel created in the lab ( bovine collagen is made from cow tissue ) , it does n't cause allergic reactions , as collagen does in a few patients . That means no waiting six weeks for allergy-test results before you can try it . " It will be a boon for the patient who says , ' I have a wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Narins , a New York dermatologic surgeon who conducted some of the tests of Restylane . Beauty enthusiasts are downright giddy . " I 've yet to hear anyone say anything negative about it , " says Wendy Lewis , a cosmetic-surgery consultant in New York City who has used Restylane herself . The Swedish manufacturer of Restylane , Q-Med , plans to seek FDA approval next month and is hoping for a U.S. launch next spring . But true beauty junkies wo n't be waiting that long . Some U.S. doctors are bringing back bootleg Restylane  --  or having patients do it  --  and charging up to $1,000 a shot .  --  By Charla Krupp
