Judging from the cascade of credit-card offers in your mailbox , you would think there is plenty of competition in the industry . Banks have been leaping over one another to grab more of what industry types call " wallet share "  --  a bigger chunk of the 80% of U.S. households that already carry plastic . So banks pick fights with other banks . Special , predatory offers abound  --  2.87 billion mailings in 1999 alone . " Competition does n't get any better than this , " says David Robertson , president of the Nilson Report , a credit-card-industry newsletter . <P> Oh , yes , it does . And so far as the Department of Justice is concerned , maybe a lot better . Its antitrust division spent the summer trying a complex  --  some argue convoluted  --  case against Visa USA and MasterCard International in the U.S. Southern District of New York , in Manhattan . The two-year-old suit alleges that the associations , which together control more than 75% of the credit-card market , have conspired to keep Americans frozen in a sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Justice asserts that the big brands ' coziness limits competition and that together they unfairly keep other teams ( read American Express and Discover ) off the playing field . Since 1976  --  after a Justice Department review nudged the brands toward so-called duality  --  banks have been able to issue both Visa and MasterCard . The brands are actually joint ventures owned by the banks that issue cards . Trouble is , the government says , the same powerful banks control both associations . The biggest banks have been able to sit on one brand 's board of directors and hold great sway in the other . That 's not all . Visa and MasterCard restrict their member banks from issuing competing cards from Amex and Discover as well . This circle of control , the feds say , bars real competition from the marketplace , and it has kept technological leaps and new credit services from benefiting American wallets . <P> Consumer advocates like former Senator Howard Metzenbaum , chairman of the Consumer Federation of America , hope that a government win might lead to a shake-up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 17.8% . Interest rates and penalty fees have shot up over the past several years , as issuers scramble to compensate for the growing number of Americans  --  now a majority  --  who clear their balances every month to avoid such charges . The fee system is at issue in several other cases involving the behemoths : <P>  --  In August , a federal judge in Seattle granted class-action status to a suit alleging that Bank One 's First USA , the nation 's second largest issuer , deceived customers by raising interest rates beyond the fixed level that was advertised . The class of cardholders is expected to swell to more than 10 million , and a loss could squeeze First USA for more than $1 billion . <P>  --  In July , Citigroup , whose Citibank is the largest issuer , said it would settle a class action accusing two Citi-owned banks of declaring many payments late and assessing late charges even if they were received on the due date . The bank pleaded innocent , but to avoid litigation , it is shelling out a $45 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who file claims .
