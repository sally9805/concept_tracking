When my daughter was a toddler , she hated to get her eyes wet in the bath . Normally easy going , Payton would whine and squirm launching into a full-blown tantrum the moment water splash her eyes . Gone were the days when baby 's bath time was a sweet opportunity to reconnect . New fears often emerge in the toddler years , and fear of water - whether tub-time nerves or apprehension at the swimming pool - is certainly one of the more common ones , says psychotherapist Alyson Schfer , author of Honey , I Wrecked the Kids . Luckily , there are many ways to help your child work through the fear and get back in the swim of things . STUCK SPOTS Where do fears like this come from ? In young children , they 're often related to developmental advances that give kids a new ( but not always realistic ) awareness of potential dangers : NINE MONTHS OLD Baby now realizes he is separate from mom and dad . The resulting anxiety ( most often seen in clinginess and tears when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other fears , like water . TWO YEARS OLD Two-year-olds are engaged and observant , but they do n't yet have the life experience to explain everyday occurrences . A toddler might , for example , see bathwater go down the drain , but not understand how this works . What looks like fear of water might actually be a fear of getting sucked down the drain . THREE YEARS OLD Kids are more creative in their thinking , but do n't distinguish well between reality and " pretend . " They may think a monster lurks under the water or wonder if they 'll get swallowed up . One bad experience can lead to a prolonged period of fear . A slip in the tub that momentarily dunked his face in the water or a loud motorboat that startled him at the beach can spook a child for months afterward . BATH BOOSTERS With bathing , it 's not really about the water , it 's about what 's happening with the water - shampoo in the eyes , a splashed face and slippery surfaces , says Schfer . Strategies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . Ask what she is afraid of and listen closely to her response . Depending on the exact worry , the following strategies may help : * Climb in . Janice Shaw , of North York , Ont. , spent long hours trying to convince her toddler , Ruben , to sit down in the tub . Finally , she solved the problem by bathing with her son , showing him it was OK to relax and have fun while getting clean . * Cabri the waters . If your child hates to be splashed , do n't put a rambunctious sibling in the tub with him . * Cover up . Give your child a visor , mask or washcloth to protect her eyes . There are times when Payton , now seven , still requests a cloth . Sometimes she uses it and other times , just knowing it 's handy to wipe away splashes is comfort enough . * Look waaay up . Place a picture on the ceiling to distract your child and encourage her to tip her head back for rinsing. * DIY . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rinse his own hair . * Make It fun . Bring out tub toys , and make silly hairdos with shampoo . * Take showers . Oddly enough , some kids who hate the bath are fine with the shower spray . * Give a sponge bath . There 's no rule that says bathing needs to be an everynight routine , says Schfer , and a few days ' break might allow a young child to forget his worry . SWIMMING STRATEGIES From a sensory point of view , a public pool can be overwhelming for some children - the smell of chlorine , the noise , the crowds . It can be frustrating when little Emma refuses to take the plunge while the fun carries on without her . But with a calm , consistent approach , time and a few of these tips , you should soon see progress . First , respect that your child is genuinely fearful and do n't force him to go any faster than he is able , advises Schfer . In her practice , she uses desensitization . By slowly increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the last , progress can be made in increments . " Do n't force kids who really have a fear , " agrees Tracey Warren , national director and safety expert for Child Safe Canada . " Take it back a step . " Judy Roche 's son , Cadell , was only two when he fell into a friend 's pool in Bowmanville , Ont . While his dad quickly pulled him to safety , he was clearly traumatized . He refused to participate in parent-and-tot swim lessons , which he had previously enjoyed . CadelFs parents spent months reintroducing him to the water . One week , he sat on the side of the pool just watching others swim . The next week , he put his legs in the water , and so on . Now at four , Cadell goes to lessons in the big pool without his parents by his side . Other tips : * Practise prevention . Warren recommends getting kids in the water as early as possible . Parent-and-tot swim programs are play-based , encouraging little ones to enjoy songs and water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But if a program is n't your thing , just go to the pool and play together . * Do n't overdramatize . While you should take fear seriously , overreacting can fuel it . Express confidence in your child by telling the swim instructor , " Sarah 's a little nervous and needs time to get used to the water , " rather than " Sarah 's terrified of the pool . " * Make the unknown familiar . If the fear is specific to the lake or beach , your child may be daunted by the vast size of the swimming area or worried about what might be in there with him . Try limiting the space by picking an inlet or other small area . Use goggles or a mask so your child can see what 's under the water . * Face it . If getting her face wet is the bugaboo , sit on the side and dip a cloth or sponge in the pool and dab one another 's face so she can get used to the wetness . Have her bring a handful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blow a rubber duck across the surface , slowly working on getting the face closer to the water . * Use water aids - for a while . It 's OK to use whatever toys or equipment it takes to get over a fear , but Warren warns that it 's important to practise swimming without goggles and life jackets because accidental drowning can occur when kids fall in without their water aids and panic . Most childhood fears will pass , either on their own or with our gentle help . Like adults , though , children may develop intense phobias that become crippling . If months pass and your child 's fear of water remains very strong despite your efforts , it may be time to see a psychologist , psychotherapist or paediatrician - especially if you can see that the fear is intruding on other areas of her life .
