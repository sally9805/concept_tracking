<p>  --  When LeBron James crashed to the floor at The Palace of Auburn Hills on Wednesday , Cleveland Cavaliers Coach Mike Brown said his heart skipped a beat . Brown sprinted down the court to check on James as the franchise crawled around on his right knee , writhing in pain , with his left foot elevated . <p> In that brief moment of despair , discussions of James 's late charge at the league 's most valuable player award , his string of nine consecutive games with at least 35 points , and his recent success at hitting buzzer-beating jumpers did n't matter . As James limped off the court late in the third quarter of a loss against the Detroit Pistons , they were replaced by thoughts of another LeBron-less postseason . <p> To the relief of Brown and many around basketball , it was only a sprained ankle . Nothing serious . Nothing that would keep James out of more than just one regular season game  --  he is expected to play Sunday night against the Washington Wizards  --  and certainly nothing that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cleveland has been without for eight years . In his third season , James will finally get to take the stage in the NBA playoffs . " It 's something that I dreamed about the last two years , " James said . <p> James , who will make his final appearance at Verizon Center this season Sunday night unless the Wizards can secure the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference , has had a spectacular regular season . At only 21 , he is about to become the fourth player in NBA history to average at least 31 points , 7 rebounds and 6 assists , joining a small fraternity that includes Oscar Robertson , Jerry West and Michael Jordan . In leading the long-suffering Cavaliers to the playoffs for the first time since 1998 ( when he was in seventh grade ) , James has improved in almost all aspects of his game  --  shooting , scoring , rebounding , passing and leadership on and off the court . <p> " He 's one of the top two or three players in the league now , " Pistons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the top of the mountain very quickly . With the hype he got coming in , it was hard to imagine that he could 've lived up to it . He 's surpassed it . " <p> But James understands that his already larger-than-life persona  --  he is featured attempting a dunk on a 10-story billboard in downtown Cleveland with the caption , " We 're All Witnesses "  --  can elevate only in the postseason . " That 's a road you have to follow if you want to be considered among the great ones , " said NBA Commissioner David Stern , who will surely enjoy the ratings boost James 's presence in the playoffs will provide . " The campaign last year about the Finals was ' where legends are born , ' and I think you could have said that for the playoffs . . . . Clearly in order to write yourself large in NBA history , you 've got to be in the playoffs . " <p> Many around the league are anxious to see how James responds , but Brown said he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be an adjustment period for him . You can hear about it , you can watch it on TV , but until you go through it and experience it , you wo n't really know what you 're getting into , " Brown said . " But that guy has ice water in his veins . He 's about as cool as there is out there . Not once have I seen him fold or panic . I ca n't see the playoffs being a place where he is going to . . . get scared . " <p> This is the same James who scored 21 fourth-quarter points in a losing effort against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden earlier this month . During a break in play late in the game , James leaned against the scorer 's table and began munching on his fingernails . Teammate Damon Jones ran over to James and began shouting at the young star , telling him that this was his time to take over the game . Jones kept yapping , but James 's eyes never moved beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pep talk . They do n't usually work anyway , for someone who has already discovered that nothing anyone tells him will ever come close to the experience of actually going through it . " I had to figure everything out on my own , " James said . <p> Few players make an immediate impact their first time in the postseason . Michael Jordan advanced to the postseason as a rookie , but needed four trips to actually win a playoff series . Shaquille O'Neal got swept . Kobe Bryant is remembered for shooting two air balls in crunch time against Utah . <p> " At every level of his short NBA career , he 's responded , and I think he 'll respond in the playoffs . But it 's not going to be easy . No matter how great those guys are , it 's not easy the first time , " said Cavaliers point guard Eric Snow , who played in Philadelphia with Allen Iverson , one of the few stars who dived right into playoff success . <p> James has a man 's body , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is prepared for the playoff grind , when the intensity is ratcheted up several notches and defenses deliver poundings on a nightly basis . " I do n't worry about it , " said James , who is averaging 31.6 points , 7.1 rebounds and 6.6 assists this season . " My game does n't change . I 'm still going to be the same player I am right now in the regular season . The level of intensity does step up a bit , but that does n't mean my game steps down . My game elevates to the level of play . " <p> James has raised his game considerably in the past two months . The Cavaliers ( 48-31 ) have won 12 of their past 14 games . During that run , he has recorded two triple-doubles . He scored at least 30 points 10 games in a row . He silenced some of his critics who said he was afraid to take the final shot by hitting game-winners against Charlotte and New Orleans/Oklahoma City . " I do n't go out there and try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later added , " I 'm happy I have few under my belt . " <p> He was named Eastern Conference player of the month in March and became the first player to ever win player of the week honors in three consecutive weeks . " The level he 's playing at now , I do n't know if anyone is even close , " said Cavaliers General Manager Danny Ferry , who hopes to sign James to a five-year contract extension this summer . " It 's different now . His will has taken over the last two months . He says ' I 'm not quitting . We 're going to get this game . ' He 's really been driven in that regard and it 's obviously had an effect on our team . " <p> That will was on display in New Jersey on April 8 , when James scored 18 fourth-quarter points and provided one of the best highlights of the season . Trailing by three in the final minute , James picked up a loose ball from Vince Carter and sprinted down the court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road block . Nets forward Cliff Robinson reached in and hacked James while teammate Jason Kidd placed his hand on the ball and pushed down . But in a remarkable display of strength , James jumped into the air , broke free of Robinson and Kidd , and spun a layup off the glass that went in . <p> James sank the free throw to complete the three-point play and tie the game . Kidd called it " an MVP play . " Brown said , " He was like a linebacker let loose . " The shot crushed the Nets , who were on a 14-game winning streak , and helped the Cavaliers clinch home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs with a 108-102 victory . " He has developed the inner strength , the hunger , a little meanness , which you have to have in order to be great , " said former Cleveland coach Paul Silas , who coached James his first two seasons in the league . <p> Silas has been impressed with James 's progression in his third season , but said James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's his ballclub now and everybody knows it , " Silas said . " He was so young when he first came in , he did n't really understand what leadership meant . Of course , he had not really done anything in the pros , so veterans were real reluctant to listen to what he was saying , even when he was right on the money . " <p> James recently admitted that when he first entered the league , he deferred to Ricky Davis and Zydrunas Ilgauskas and kept his mouth shut . He has been much more vocal this season and grown more comfortable in the role of team leader . " I do n't know when it happened , but right now , it 's my team , " James said , then looked around the cramped visiting locker room at the Palace of Auburn Hills and found no dissenters . <p> With the Cavaliers on pace to win 50 games despite former Wizard Larry Hughes , Cleveland 's big offseason acquisition , missing 45 games with a broken finger , Brown said there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable player of the league . " You take the second-best player away from any team and you ask yourself if that team is going to be in position to win 50 games . You 'd say , ' No , ' " Brown said . " That 's just LeBron getting it done . He 's been terrific . " <p> Already the youngest MVP of the all-star game , James was asked what being considered for MVP meant to him . " Nothing , " he said . <p> The playoffs mean more .
