<p> Ask Americans if they 'd prefer the next president to be similar to George W. Bush  --  or completely different  --  and surveys show a burgeoning market for the UnBush . <p> Just as the law of supply-and-demand dictates , we 're now witnessing an abundant supply of politicians challenging , critiquing , even castigating the president . That would be typical of the Democrats , of course , but it 's now becoming the norm among Republicans  --  including some who aspire to the White House . <p> The latest Time magazine poll indicates that by a 60-to-36 percent majority , people want somebody with different policies from Bush 's . Nearly a majority reported a " very negative " impact on their view of Bush from the Iraq war and rising gas prices  --  and more than a third also threw in the deficit , hurricane-recovery efforts , the economy , and the sorry fate of his much-heralded Social Security " reform " initiative , which now languishes in a state of political rigor mortis . <p> After months of careening downhill , Bush 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Gallup Poll found that even among Republicans , 7 in 10 voters are predisposed toward a candidate who disagrees with Bush . <p> Little wonder the GOP 's White House aspirants have exhibited a Bush allergy . In last month 's elections , even a Republican conservative such as Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum avoided campaigning alongside Bush ( and party moderates such as California Gov . Arnold Schwarzenegger gave him a cold shoulder , too . ) <p> The exception is the GOP 's biggest innate UnBush , Arizona Sen. John McCain , who appears at his side , but also makes a habit of publicly second-guessing some of his moves . With McCain polling so high that pundits joke he may become president by acclamation , Bush needs McCain more than McCain needs him  --  or so figures Vice President Cheney 's public star has fallen even farther than Bush 's . Doing events with McCain is proof that Bush understands you do n't campaign with the vice president you have , you campaign with the vice president you might wish or want to have . " <p> Conservatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but that me-tooism does not embrace either President Bush I or II . The House of the GOP Iconoclast is rising  --  witness presidential wannabes such as McCain , Rudy Giuliani and Chuck Hagel . <p> Of course , all this could change if George W. Bush can turn things around . He 's certainly trying , as last week 's series of appearances  --  justifying the war effort while admitting some mistakes  --  showed . <p> Evidence mounts , though , that the Bush administration no longer holds carte blanche . <p> The Republican-controlled Senate recently voted overwhelmingly to demand the White House produce quarterly updates on conditions for withdrawal in Iraq , and to allow some terrorists convicted by military tribunals at U.S. detention camps to appeal in civilian courts . GOP lawmakers also balked at Bush 's move to approve oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , and refused his wishes on the 2006 budget bill . <p> It has n't been that long ago that the president 's surrogates could paint GOP critics of Bush as kooky heretics . Case in point : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the leading UnBush in the GOP quest to retain the White House . <p> His heresy used to be second-guessing U.S. policies toward Iraq  --  long before it became fashionable to do so . Audaciously self-righteous , he announced six months ago : " The White House is completely disconnected from reality . ... It 's like they 're just making it up as we go along . The reality is that we 're losing in Iraq . " Under Bush , the Republican Party had pulled " loose of its moorings . " <p> At the time , he was a lone voice crying in the Republican wilderness , and retribution from Bush loyalists was swift . Kenneth Tomlinson , who as then-head of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting calibrated PBS guests on an ideological scale to prevent a leftist tilt , tallied Hagel as a liberal . The conservative National Review magazine archly referred to him as " Sen. Chuck Hagel , R-France . " <p> Actually Hagel 's home state  --  Nebraska  --  rarely is mistaken for the native soil of Napoleon Bonaparte . A self-made millionaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian Coalition , a 94 percent score of support for the president on roll-call votes , an " A " from the National Rifle Association and an 87 percent score from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce . <p> But he sports an UnBush view of foreign affairs , an UnBush disdain for what he sees as U.S. overreach in the world , and a contrarian 's skepticism that indicates he has n't quaffed the party Kool-Aid . He also is a decorated Vietnam vet , which gives him credibility when he takes on Bush over the war in Iraq . <p> The oldest in his family whose father died when he was a teenager , Hagel volunteered for combat , was wounded twice including an explosion that blew out his eardrums and left shrapnel in his chest , and was awarded two Purple Hearts . <p> " One of the things that always strikes me about people who 've had this kind of searing experience is that there are some things that are beyond politics , " said Frank Partsch , recently retired editorial page editor of the Omaha World Herald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sunday morning talk show circuit  --  this one on July 3  --  he was asked whether his criticism was n't undermining his president and the war effort . He answered by making an analogy to Vietnam : <p> " I watched 58,000 Americans get chewed up over a process ( from ) 1961 to 1975 ... when , in fact , we had a policy that was losing . And the members of Congress were interestingly silent and absent in asking tough questions . As long as I 'm a United States senator , I will do everything I can to ensure that we have a policy worthy of these brave young men and women . ... And when I do n't say anything , I fail those I served with , I fail those 58,000 ... and I fail the families of those who already lost their lives in Iraq and been maimed . " <p> Hagel , who is sometimes nicknamed McCain Lite , deflects queries about his ambitions by quoting McCain 's observation that any politician who is n't in detox is rumored to be running . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allure , which might explain his recent forays into Iowa and New Hampshire . <p> " He 's taken a lot of heat from Republicans , but I 'll give you the other side of it  --  it 's very clever , " said John Hibbing , professor of political science at the University of Nebraska . He noted Hagel 's opposition to abortion and gay rights appeals to the religious right , and his scolding about profligate spending appeals to fiscal conservatives . " So you 're left with this one issue , this one increasingly unpopular issue , where he was there first saying we just screwed this up entirely . <p> " If Iraq continues to be an albatross for the Republican Party , let 's just say Chuck Hagel might not look bad at all in 2008 . " <p> Hagel got there first , but now more Republicans are slipping out of the bunker to express misgivings . Cynics see it as a craven move to save their own political fortunes ; others say their change of mind about Iraq is no different from that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted against the measure to require Iraqi war progress reports . Its author is GOP Sen. John Warner of Virginia , a veteran of World War II and the Korean War who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee . <p> Among those supporting the bill was another GOP presidential hopeful , Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee , a physician who is auditioning for the 2008 role of " compassionate conservative " by distancing himself from Bush 's ban on most stem cell research . <p> Increasingly , Bush and Cheney have clung to the qualified support of men like McCain and Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsay Graham , who maintain the invasion of Iraq was a noble cause . <p> Yet just last Sunday , Graham told NBC that at " every turn , we 've underestimated how hard it would be . We 've paid a price in the past for our missteps . " He also has begun to castigate Bush and fellow GOP legislators for overspending . " If we really want to do well in 2006 , we need to have fiscal discipline like Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost our way as a party . Our base is deflated , and taxpayers do n't see any difference between us and the Democrats . " <p> McCain is at the vanguard of the challenge to the Bush administration on the question of torture . When Cheney made a trip to Capitol Hill to fight for wiggle room  --  to craft an exception permitting the CIA to torture captives in certain circumstances  --  McCain trumped him by citing his experience as a prisoner of war during Vietnam : " Many of my comrades were subjected to very cruel , very inhumane and degrading treatment , a few of them even unto death . But every one of us  --  every single one of us  --  knew and took great strength from the belief that we were different from our enemies . " <p> The McCain provision prevailed with 90 Senate votes , and on Wednesday the House joined the de facto rebuke , forcing Bush to accept a provision he had threatened to veto . <p> It has been more than a half-century since a presidential election in which neither the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presidents are bound by pride to champion their own records , and vice presidents are bound by loyalty , and smart politics , to do so , even while delicately stressing their differences . But , the 2008 campaign will be another story  --  and it looks like there will be nothing delicate about it . ( 1 ) Sen.
