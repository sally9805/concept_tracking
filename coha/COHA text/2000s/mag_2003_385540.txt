Section : SCIENCE A controversial new transplant operation will let victims of horrifying injuries face the world . MEDICINE <p> Of all the misfortunes that can befall the human form , none is as devastating as the destruction of the face . Each year , accidents , diseases and birth defects rob thousands of the familiar symmetry of the nose , eyes , lips and ears that identifies each of us as an individual . For many who have suffered from flesh- and bone-wrenching injuries or birth defects , surgeons can work miracles . But for an unfortunate few , the loss of tissue is so great that modern medicine can offer little more than sympathy . <p> Or , as some surgeons have suggested , is there more that can be done ? It is a reasonable question . After all , it patients routinely receive organs as complex as hearts and lungs , and it arms from the dead can be grafted onto the living , what stands in the way of face transplants ? <p> Absolutely nothing , contends Dr. Peter Butler . A surgeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off an international debate on face transplantation about a year ago when he suggested that this radical surgery is the only effective way to beat severely disfigured patients . At the time , he predicted the first operation of this type would take place within 18 months - sometime in the spring of 2004 . But , within weeks he found himself at the center of a fierce debate on the ethics of this procedure following a meeting of the British Association of Plastic Surgeons . While society may have no problem using vital organs from the dead , there seems to be difficulty with the notion of a face surviving beyond the grave . <p> The situation rapidly degenerated when photographers for British tabloids knocked on the door of the home of the young woman who was supposed to be Butler 's first patient . A victim of horrific bums suffered in a childhood car accident , she found herself caught up in a swirl of unwanted publicity . Her family threatened to sue . Butler turned off his phone , and the hospital announced that plans for the controversial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the medical community the idea did not go away . At least two groups in the United States are believed to be privately planning similar operations , to be performed perhaps as early as this corning spring . <p> Neither of the American teams wishes to discuss their plans before they complete the operation . However , before he stepped out of the limelight , Butler provided extensive information about his operation in medical journals and at conferences . The most striking aspect of Butler 's planned surgery is that it involves little that is new and nothing that is revolutionary . From Butler 's published work and conversations with surgeons , who understandably prefer not to be identified , POPULAR MECHANICS can conjecture on how the American teams will proceed . <p> One of the major misconceptions about a face transplant is that it can produce the sort of perfect identity swap depicted in the thriller " Face/Off . " In this 1997 thriller , a surgical robot swaps the faces of the hero and villain , played by John Travolta and Nicolas Cage . At a conference of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide a dramatic improvement in appearance , but that a facial problem would still be evident . Only now , instead of the deformity being visible as far away as 45 ft. , it would not be noticeable until you stepped within about 1 yard of the recipient . The Operations <p> The transplant would require three separate operations . The first surgery would be performed upon the corpse of the donor . In a procedure referred to as " degloving , " an incision would be made around the hairline , behind or around the ears and in the naturally occurring folds of the neck . <p> A face without the subtle muscle and eye movements that express feelings and reactions would offer little improvement over current facial reconstruction techniques . In those procedures , tissue is transferred from another part of a person 's body , creating an expressionless masklike appearance . For the transplanted face to act like the original , surgeons say , special care would be required in working near the nerves that control certain movements . These include the seventh cranial nerve , which controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement , and the fifth , which controls facial sensation . Special attention also would be given to the fourth and third cranial nerves , which control up and down eye movements and medial eye movements , respectively . <p> When it was certain that the donor 's face was sufficiently healthy for transplant , surgeons would begin the second stage of the operation - performing a similar degloving procedure on the recipient . This procedure would take longer than the first since it would involve clamping off veins and arteries . The most critical work would again be in the vicinity of the cranial nerves . Even the smallest nick or bruise could result in paralysis , destroying the natural movement that the transplant operation seeks to restore . <p> At this point , depending upon the extent of the recipient 's injuries , specialists could be called in to perform bone grafts . <p> With the donor 's face in the operating room and the recipient 's own face removed , the third and most critical procedure would begin . Physicians specializing in microsurgery would begin to reattach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structures are so small , doctors would have to operate using microscopes . Butler estimates it might take 12 to 14 hours to complete this part of the procedure . Finally , the surgeons would install temporary tubing and drains to remove the fluid buildup that follows such extensive surgery . <p> The degree to which the recipient would resemble the donor would depend largely on the similarity of their underlying bone structure . Also , if there were extreme differences in , say , the prominence of the cheeks or chin , implants would be added after the patient 's face was degloved . <p> Rolling out of the operating room after surgery , the patient would look the best he would for several months . Experience with patients who have undergone extensive facial reconstruction suggests that even with drains , there would be considerable swelling . At this point , the recipient would begin receiving a cocktail of three anti-rejection drugs . Within two months , the recipient 's face would return to its normal size . Depending upon the extent of nerve damage that existed before the transplant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several more months , or perhaps more than a year , before the patient 's facial movements returned to normal . <p> The most difficult task may not be the surgery , but obtaining a donor face . After Butler realized that a face transplant was technically possible , he took the next logical step and asked if anyone would be interested in donating his or her face . All 120 people he surveyed said " no . " The response is all the more startling when you consider that 80 of the 120 people he asked were doctors and nurses who presumably understood the benefits that a face transplant could offer . <p> Fortunately , the need for donors is small . Surgeons estimate that in the parts of the world where medicine is sufficiently advanced to perform transplant surgery , fewer than 100 people might benefit from the procedure annually . Because of the risk of surgery , and the organ damage and increased infection associated with the continuing use of anti-rejection drugs , surgeons are unanimous that a face transplant would never be used purely for cosmetic reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plastic cheek and jaw implants are a simpler and safer means of altering one 's appearance . <p> " The most difficult task may not be the surgery , but obtaining a donor face .
