1 <p> Down Time <p> Teddy Hastings hopped down from his treadmill after burning off the usual impressive quotas of time , mass , and distance , and reached for his bottle of purified water . If there was one thing he was good at it was running in place . Outside , the woods were dark along Montcalm Road . Sleet , like an animal scrabbling for entry , tapped against the panes . <p> The water he drained in one gulp . It did not appease his thirst . <p> To stretch out his tendons he leaned hard against the wall with both hands splayed before him , like a man holding back  --  or welcoming  --  a flood . His biceps bulged , his triceps trembled . He was a big , keg-chested man with a long list of aggrievements ; even on a good day it took forever to get loose . And this was not a good day . His torso felt dense , congested ; his hamstrings were knotted tight . Somewhere in the meat of his abdomen , beneath the pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fist . Older people , Teddy knew , were susceptible to such things , to intermittent attacks of localized pain , and though he did n't like to think of himself as an older person , maybe now that time had come . Fortunately he did n't mind a little pain now and then . In fact he welcomed it , as an employee welcomes a performance review , or a home team welcomes a formidable adversary : because without it nothing would be tested or advanced . <p> This was why he 'd converted the basement that summer , after his dreary little tussle with the authorities . Why he 'd taken up the hammer and power saw , plastered and sanded and paneled the walls , tacked down the carpet , plexiglassed the windows and bolstered the frames . At his age you required some insulation in your life ; you could n't just lie down in the basement and freeze . <p> Above him the house lay quiet , submissive . He could feel its weight poised atop his shoulders . Yet another dumbbell to lift . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , intemperate god who oversaw his labors , Teddy sank to his knees and began to push himself up by the fingertips , thirty-five times . Then onto his back for thirty-five crunches . Then thirty of each , then twenty-five , then twenty , and so on , descending by increments of five toward zero 's rest . It was a simple , satisfying routine , one he 'd brought home from his brief incarceration in the Carthage County lockup that summer ( along with an orphaned Koran , a whopping case of shingles , and the cell phone numbers of various felons , minor miscreants , and illegal aliens ) and now practiced daily on the floor like a penitent . That was how you toned the self , Teddy thought : through torment . You set goals and standards you failed to meet , and you refused to forgive yourself for failing ; that was one way you knew you were alive . He imagined there must be other , less arduous ways to know you were alive , ways forgotten or as yet unrevealed . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few weeks before , in an effort to enliven the dismal ambience of the basement , he 'd taped an enormous nine-color world map , property of the Carthage Union School District , across the corrugated grid of the ceiling . Now with every sit-up he watched the map approach , fall away , then approach again , as if the world from which he 'd retreated were exacting revenge , teasing him with immanence , looming into view , then fading , like a pop-up ad on a computer screen . The map itself had seen better days . Its glossy sheen was fading , its arctic circle receding ; the blue line of its equator quaked and bulged . Still , it gave him pleasure just to look at the thing , to scan the hot zones , the tropical canopy , the jumbled geometries of the borders , the progression of rolling , mellifluous names . Guyana , Nigeria , Ethiopia , Malaysia . He lay on his back , crunching his way toward them like a galley slave . Somehow he never managed to arrive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accordion . With two shaking fingers he took his pulse . The skin over his wrist , thick as it was , failed to muffle that monotonous riot , that thunder inside . <p> The windows were slick with night 's black glaze . There was no looking out . But say you looked in , Teddy thought . Say you happened by , an exile from sleep , walking your dog in the predawn gloom , and stopped to peer in through the lighted window . What would you see ? A red-faced , wild-haired person heaving for breath on an all-weather carpet , holding his own hand . Fortunately Teddy Hastings was not outside . He was inside , generating steam and heat , stoking the engines . At his age a man shifts his focus , from the romance of building to the hard facts of maintaining . The building has all been done . Even if the nails are bent or mutilated and nothing is quite level or plumb or square . The building has been done ; no room for more unless you tear something down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hard thing was to keep them aloft . The tearing down came anyway ; no need to contribute to that . Yet in the end one always did , it seemed . <p> Outside an engine was idling , some night taxi bound for the airport , waiting for a passenger to emerge from his big house on Montcalm Road . But no : it was only the high school kid who delivered the paper . Teddy listened for the dolorous thunk it made , then the tumbling fall down the steps . <p> Six fifteen . And so the day arrives , swollen with ads , coiled in its plastic bag . <p> He had nowhere to go . He was officially on leave from the middle school this year , half-pay . He had never taken a leave before , had never wanted one particularly , and now he was beginning to understand why . He was n't good at it . Because a man ca n't live in an open field : he needs landmarks , contours , walls and roofs and floors . Once he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saggy , out of sync , a chain slipped free of its gears . A rift yawned open between theory and practice , between the capacity for action and its execution . There are people who prefer not to be left to their own devices , people whose own devices have grown rusty and unserviceable from lack of use , and Teddy supposed that was the lesson plan this year : he was one of these people and not the other kind . The knowledge was painful but intriguing . It gave his days the character of a search . Restless , he wandered the empty house , drifting from room to room like a detective making notes for an unsolicited investigation . In the mornings he drank his black , bitter coffee  --  Danielle had sent the beans all the way from Africa  --  listened to the radio , swept the wood floors like a charwoman even if no dirt was visible . His lunch he ate at the computer , playing solitaire , smearing the keyboard with oily fingers , splattering the screen with soup . He had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming one now . He enjoyed solitaire but lacked the patience , and also the motive , to win . Winning ended the game , sent the kings bounding merrily away , and sealed up the window . It was losing that kept you going . It was losing that made you focus , that lured you back in with the promise of a new deal , an unplayed hand ... <p> And so the hours passed . He could not remember feeling like this before , so indolent , so jittery , all bottled up like a soda . In the afternoons he 'd sit at the old attention-starved Baldwin upright they 'd bought years ago , when the girls could still be bullied into lessons , playing the same pieces at approximately the same tempo and level of competence he 'd been playing since he was twelve . His Satie meandered , his Bach was a hash ; his Chopin lurched and stuttered like a neurotic schoolboy . His heart it so happened was full of musical feelings ; there was barely room in that clenched , spasmodic organ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear was bad , his dynamics were stiff , he lacked control and modulation , and he 'd never learned to improvise . And now it was too late . He was fifty-two years old . Fifty- three . How much change was still possible ? At this point he felt condemned to go on repeating the old mistakes , the unlearned lessons , forever , like a player piano scrolling methodically through its uninspired repertoire . <p> A jet rumbled overhead , going somewhere else . Above him the house slept on , making its night noises : its ticking clocks and groaning shutters , its whistling pipes , its four dormant stories . Sometimes , coming home late from a meeting , Teddy would marvel at the sight of it , vast and chambered , lit up in the darkness like a ship . Whether he was captain or passenger of that ship he no longer knew . More and more he felt like a stowaway . <p> No man becomes a prophet who was not first a shepherd . <p> The words were in his head when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body furled up like a flag . It was something he 'd read in jail , a line of graffiti scratched into the wall over his cot . Jail , he 'd been told , made poets of some men and criminals of others . He wondered what it had made him . <p> Beside him Gail stirred and sighed , her features wistful in dreams . Her body was a safe harbor just out of reach . He 'd have liked to steer into it , take refuge there in her long , sleep-softened neck , the musky warmth , like risen bread , that emanated from her hair ... but no : at the last moment she shifted her weight , and the mattress sank under her hip , leaving Teddy stranded alone on the far side of the bed . The cold side . <p> How long he 'd lain there unmoving , wrapped in the straitjacket of his own arms , he did n't know . He 'd refused to look at the clock . The red glow of its digits was an annoyance . So was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bed . Soon the old dog would be sleeping for good , he thought . Was n't that a terrible thing ? Hot mist rose in Teddy 's eyes . His nerves felt nibbled down to the cobs . His feet dangled over the edge of the bed , seeking purchase in the invisible . ( Older people , he 'd read , had trouble sleeping too . ) The stubbled topography of the ceiling was like a tote board of his discontents . His job was no longer his job exactly . His friends were no longer his friends exactly . His wife had retreated into her own busy sphere of influence and seemed no longer quite his wife exactly . His daughters , Mimi and Danielle , had abandoned the father-ship altogether  --  Danny adrift in the third world ; Mimi at sea in her own house , eddying listlessly in circles . He groaned . The night seemed boundless , vast , a wilderness he 'd never be permitted to leave . For him , as for Bruno , life had narrowed to a waiting game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great thing ... <p> He thought of Philip , in his own hard bed underground . His brother 's death from melanoma the year before was like an explosion in space : stunning , weightless , invisible . Poor Philly , he thought , I 'll never see him again . And yet in truth he saw Philip all the time . Whenever he closed his eyes , there was Philip 's face , that pale bubble , floating untethered across the insides of his lids . Every night he loomed a little closer . Yes , it was almost oppressive at this point , almost tedious , how often he saw Philip . Time to close the door , he thought , on the whole death-of-Philip business . A year in any culture was long enough for mourning . And yet the door was such a warped , flimsy thing ; it opened and opened but never closed . What kind of door was that ? <p> It was only October but the leaves were down , the brook behind the house had grown its first skin of ice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bruised , lay strewn around the orchards like the aftermath of some stormy debauch . Gail kicked at him under the covers . No one wanted him to sleep . <p> Finally , as if conceding the battle to a superior force , he 'd clicked on the bed lamp and reached for his book . <p> As a young man Teddy had no time for reading . Books were for the Philips , the moody , passive people who liked to sit alone in a room all day doing nothing . Teddy preferred the active life . No doubt Philip would have preferred the active life too , but he 'd never quite mastered it , had been too haughty , too shy , too laid-back , too something . Now of course Philip was dead  --  really alone in a room , really doing nothing  --  and seeing as how he could no longer do much reading at this point , Teddy felt compelled to do it for him . <p> He was halfway through Thesiger 's Danakil Diary . It was his sort of book : outward-bound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The radical solitude of the desert , the dank resistance of the jungle , the flare and assault of tropical heat . Already that year he 'd sailed up the Gambia with Mungo Park , floated down the Nile with James Bruce , crossed the Horn with Richard Burton , galloped the Levant with T. E. Lawrence . Now he 'd set out again , with the cool , unflappable Thesiger , through the Abyssinian lowlands and into the Danakil Depression , the harsh , primordial emptiness of Afar . <p> The harder the way , the more worthwhile the journey : that was the idea . <p> He felt , like a programmer scanning a hard drive , on the trail of an encoded truth . It had something to do with going far out of your way toward an unknown end , then coming back . Vanishing into a distant , uncharted landscape , half-mad with fatigue , navigating by dead reckoning , starving yourself down to sinew and bone , then returning from the brink of extinction to tell your tale and claim what was yours . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the return was , Teddy supposed , a troubling sign , but then he 'd never been blessed with much in the way of imagination . He put his trust in firsthand experience , trial by fire . Hence his love for the explorers  --  the cranks , the misfits , the egotists , the desert solitaries , the hardship freaks . He toted them home from the library in a leather rucksack he 'd once intended for his own travels , for smelly , balled-up socks and filthy boxers washed out in some remote youth-hostel sink . So far all it had carried was paper : essays , lesson plans , budgetary requisitions . But that could still change . <p> As for the books , he piled them up on his nightstand like a miser 's currency , breathing their dusts and molds , the powders that escaped from their bindings . Their proximity was both goad and consolation . He felt their judgments bearing down on him as he slept , exonerating him from some crimes and indicting him for others . His job , he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only job he still had . <p> Off in the foothills coyotes yipped and snarled , chasing prey . <p> Gail turned onto her side , hogging the covers , indeed the whole bed , as usual . Of course it was her bed  --  he 'd made it for her as a wedding gift , wrestled it from the trunk of a bur oak he 'd toppled with a power saw in the backyard . <p> " Mother of god , " Gail had groaned when he 'd presented the bed , " so that 's what you 've been up to out in the garage . And here I thought you were already tired of me . " <p> " I 'll show you how tired I am . Get in . " <p> " The wood 's still warm . " She blushed prettily in her sleeveless nightgown . They 'd been married by then for two years , but so what ? The wooing of Gail was an ongoing process . Her childhood had been shorn away early . Her old man 's dairy farm had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstracted , would put daisies in Gail 's lunchbox but forget the food . Teddy 's job was to make up for their inattentions . He did n't mind . In his own eyes he 'd got lucky ; he did n't mind dealing with the infrastructural stuff  --  the lubing , oiling , and filtering ; the ticket-buying and table-reserving ; the playdate-arranging and calendar-keeping . These he made his province , while Gail staked out the unassigned territory upstairs . The inner moods , the private fears . So be it . He would deal with the externals . Doing things , fixing things . Making things . <p> " I hope it 's sturdier than it looks . " She flopped down onto the varnished platform , waving her limbs like a starfish ; she was five foot eight but the bed seemed to swallow her . " What is it , a king or a queen ? " <p> " What difference does it make ? " <p> " If we want to buy a mattress and sheets , we have to know the size . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Really ? To me it feels more like a queen . " <p> " Fine , " he said , " call it a queen . " But it was n't that either . The planks of untreated oak , left too long in the dank garage , had warped over time , thereby throwing off his measurements , altering angles that had possibly , he conceded , been drawn a bit too hastily to begin with ; and so the platform had turned out to be not exactly a king and not exactly a queen , but some odd transgendered size of its own . Gail for her part was n't listening . Already she 'd commenced the long glide toward sleep , her soft arms folded like wings , her white legs with their dark , cilialike hairs tucked in behind her rump , cushioning her fall . Teddy stood there watching over her , flushed with tenderness and pride . Okay , it was n't perfect , but he had built her this enormous , solid , unclassifiable thing with his own hands . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from hale , red-faced men with roping arteries who worked outdoors all winter in the construction trades ; for all his mistakes the workmanship was sound . Even now , a quarter century later , he was impressed by how well the bed had contained them , and how long . <p> Still , there were nights he lay in that bed , tracing a finger over the spines of the books on the nightstand as one might a lover who has turned her back , and wonder about the cost of that containment . Where was the book with his name on the binding ? Some report was expected of him , of his life on this earth ; but where and how to begin , and to whom he should submit this report , and in what format and what length and what language , he did n't know . His adulthood had thus far yielded few adventures . Marriage , children , ten years teaching math at the local middle school and another fourteen trying , as principal , to elevate it from a third-rate institution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He 'd never been to the Horn of Africa . Never wandered the deserts or savannas , never lunched on gazelle meat and camel piss under the acacia trees . He 'd never even completed his application to the Peace Corps , though it had arrived the week he graduated college , the product of a sudden access of enthusiasm at an informational meeting in the student union . What had held him back ? Why had he let that first restless storm pass , and why had it never returned ? In the end it had been Philip who 'd gone off after college , Philip who 'd flamed out , somewhere in the jungles of Sierra Leone , of the very Peace Corps Teddy had wanted to flame into , Philip who 'd then gone backpacking across Europe for two or three stoned , meandering years before finally settling , more by accident than design , into grad school in psychology at BU . Well , that was Philip 's way . The roundabout way . The passive way . The feckless way . All those incompletes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those abysmal studio apartments in the Combat Zone and the far ungentrified reaches of Jamaica Plain . Meanwhile Teddy the Elder , Teddy the Constant , Teddy the Builder , had stayed put in Carthage to  --  do what ? Attain a secondary credential in mathematics ? Buy and fix up this old house ? Sit on town council , umpire Little League games at the recreation park , dig up stones in the yard on weekends and compile them into walls ? Spend half his life reading about things he 'd never do , and the other half doing things he 'd never read about ? Why ? He was not the dead person , lying in a hole in the dirt . He could climb out whenever he liked . He was healthy and strong and cunning as an animal . He 'd made principal at thirty-nine , the second youngest in the state . He 'd put money away in tech stocks at just the right time . He could go , if he chose , anywhere in the world . <p> He 'd gone somewhere , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd eased from the covers , pulled on his sweats , grabbed his running shoes in one hand and his T-shirt with the other , and slipped out the door like a thief . Gail did n't stir . She was a long , luxurious sleeper ; her face , hazy and white , floated in the dark like a lunar nimbus . Envy of her oblivion , and maybe fear of it , sent him off to the basement , through the door , down the twelve wooden steps  --  he knew each one 's whiny , croaking country song by heart  --  and around the washer and dryer to the back room , where he flicked on the wan , solitary bulb that illumined his little gym . <p> True , the carpet was ragged , the walls smelled of mildew , and the windows were festooned with enormous drooping cobwebs to which insect husks clung upside down , trembling from invisible drafts . He should have swept them away a long time ago . But if his time in jail had taught Teddy anything , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbor was another man 's cage . <p> He stepped on the treadmill and , with the usual mixed feelings of boredom and relief , began to run . The second hand on his watch progressed in jerks . The house was quiet and tense , like the skin of a drum . Hot air swelled his temples ; old fillings and tarnished crowns rattled in his jaw . He felt like a zeppelin taking leave of its moorings . The ropes that bound him were brittle and frayed ; someday soon he 'd snap free . No doubt this was obvious to everyone , Teddy thought , not just the people he knew and loved but other people he did n't know , did n't love , and who did not in all likelihood love him . People such as Judge Tierney , and Zoe Bender , and his many enemies on the school board . Together they had not so much permitted him to take a year 's leave  --  his existing contract was ambiguous on the subject  --  as insisted in the end that he take it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase , Teddy thought . He 'd have liked to know how to distinguish between the best good and all the lesser kinds . <p> Meanwhile he kept running . It was important to make the most of it , this down time , this underground hour in his underground lair . Because it would not last forever . Soon he 'd have to engineer a return . Ascend the stairs , take his place at the family table , and pretend , as all dreamers do , that he was n't dreaming , that sleep was wakefulness and wakefulness sleep . <p> But say it did n't end , Teddy thought . Say he remained down here , amid the cobwebs and the radon , the dull , gurgling pipes . Say the family man removed himself from the family . Let the noisy model trains of domestic life sit idle , unattended . Lost the check register . Forgot how to separate the whites from the darks . Ignored the crumbly masonry poking through the plaster ; the water stains spreading like rain clouds across the perforated ceiling ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asbestos sifting from the pipe joints like so much rancid flour . But then ignoring such things was n't his strength . No wonder he was all in knots . Gail was right : he could let nothing go . <p> " Look at your hands , " she 'd told him that morning . " They 're all knuckles and fists like a boxer . At night you grind your teeth so loud I hear it in my sleep . " <p> " I 've always ground my teeth at night . My old man did too . It 's a genetic legacy . " <p> " And then there 's that other thing people do at night , " she said . " I 've almost forgotten what it 's called . " <p> Teddy stared at the kitchen window , awash in his own reflection . They were doing the dishes at the time . Her remark hung like steam in the air above the sink . " I thought we agreed , " he said . " A transitional period , we decided to call it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when I hear the words transitional period , I think of something that ends sooner or later . " <p> " That 's my point . " <p> " Sometimes they end badly though , Bear . That 's all I 'm saying . " <p> He nodded . His breath was short . It was as if he were back downstairs in his little gym , loading one more weight on the bar . Truth too was an exercise , he thought . <p> " Look , " he said , " the cardinals are gone . " <p> " Do n't take it personally . They vanish around this time every year . Sunnier climes . " She sipped her tea , eyeing him over the steam , then set it in the sink and reached for her yoga bag , a flame-colored thing bedecked with dragons . " What are you doing later ? Any plans ? " <p> " None . " <p> She frowned , displeased but unsurprised . It was the expression she fell into every morning , it seemed , when Mimi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Come with me to class , " she said . " It 'll do you good . Cleanse the mind . " <p> Teddy nodded and paced , hot-eyed , like a caged panther . He did n't want to cleanse his mind . He preferred it in its natural state : messy , congested . How galling it was to be observed from a wary distance and found guilty of hunger by the very beings he looked to for nourishment . " Maybe next time , " he said . <p> " Suit yourself . " <p> He watched her bustle down the foyer and out the door , the iron knocker bouncing crazily in her wake , like the hand of an unseen visitor . But no one was there . She was always heading off these days , always leaving home early and arriving late . At dinner she 'd condescend to sit for half an hour at the table with an expression of preoccupied forbearance , glancing over the mail as she picked at one of his overspiced , labor-intensive meals . Then out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book group , a friend . On weekends she 'd pop out of bed , wriggle into one of her sports bras , and go off biking or swimming or running along the side of the road in her orange vest . As if leisure too were an extreme sport . Her limbs had grown sleek and hard . Even their lovemaking of late , on those occasions love was still made , seemed only another workout , a cardiovascular shortcut on the long road to sleep . What was happening to them ? It had something to do with time , Teddy thought , time and space : the shrinkage of one and the expansion of the other . Something to do with all these leave-takings and disappearances , with empty rooms , silent phones . If only he did n't hate yoga so much ! But the one class he 'd attended had not gone well . It was held in the basement of the Unitarian church , the same dingy , blue-carpeted space to which he used to drag his daughters to Sunday school against their wills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force . Women in leotards were poised on their mats , practicing their breathing . Teddy tried his best to attain the positions , the trembling Triangle , the ungainly Warrior , the flaccid Bow from which no arrow would ever be launched , and then those postures that came naturally it seemed to animals alone  --  the Lion , the Cobra , the Camel , the Upward Facing Dog , the Downward Facing Dog . But he could not hold still . He was left feeling very downward and doglike indeed , and hardly inclined to attend another yoga class should Gail ever happen to invite him again , which now of course she never would . <p> Earlier that week they 'd gone out for his birthday to the Carthage Inn , the place one went for these things . Helplessly Teddy had looked over the menu . It was the same as last time . Nonetheless he 'd managed over the course of the evening to consume a salad , a cup of gluey bisque , two sesame rolls , a humongous , fat-marbled shank of lamb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about nine-tenths of the crFme brvlTe he and Gail had agreed to split in half . His lone act of restraint came at the end , with the pale , bluish nonfat milk he poured stingily into his coffee like a rhetorical gesture . The rest he 'd devoured like an animal  --  sopping up the juices , sucking greedily on the shank bone , furrowing out the marrow with his tongue  --  while Gail grazed numbly at the top leaves of her spinach salad , then consigned the rest to sleep moldering in the Dumpster . What waste . Maybe if they lived in the city there would be more to do at night and less need to indulge in these enormous , sedentary dinners that dulled the senses . But Gail 's law practice was here in Carthage , and she was happy here , or if not happy then at least more or less content with her present level of not-happiness , as opposed to the potential not-happiness of moving somewhere else , which he did not think they ever would . They 'd talked about moving for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk itself had become a form of movement , Teddy thought , or else a substitute for it , providing just enough current to keep the raft of the possible afloat . It was hard to know . <p> And now it was too late . He was fifty-two . Fifty- three . The raft had become rickety , precarious ; they 'd flirted with the possible too long ; their credibility was gone . At some point you have to stop thinking about moving , Teddy thought , sliding his gold card out of his wallet , and just live where you are . You ate your meal and drank your wine and tried to wring some enjoyment out of it before the bill came . <p> " Shoot , " Gail said on their way to the car , " I meant to put it on my card . " <p> " It 's a joint account . What difference does it make ? " <p> " It makes a difference to me . I wanted to be the one taking you out for a change . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But in fact it did seem to matter , on some level , and his insistence that it did n't made it matter more , not less . And now , down in the basement , running on his treadmill , he regretted his half of that conversation , and his half of the meal too , which had been more like four-fifths . The lamb was still with him . He could feel it , the carbs and proteins , the sugars and fats , settling sluggishly , like ocean sediment , in the linings of his heart . He 'd be working it off for days . Both of his daughters were vegetarians ; he was beginning to understand why . <p> He decided to keep running for another few miles and then see how he felt . The phrase came to him often these days : see how he felt . Right now as it happened he felt more or less okay , but he would take care of that . <p> He programmed the treadmill to its maximum verticality , so that for all intents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't see toward a summit he could n't reach . His heart , that petulant child , pounded sullenly at his eardrums . The lungs in his chest rattled like toys . This inner hullabaloo , though alarming , was also the source of a tenuous satisfaction . He had after all bought this machine of his own free will , submitted himself voluntarily to its tedious and complicated punishments . And for what ? Good health . The two words were conjoined in his mind like an arranged marriage  --  sturdy , dutiful , surprisingly effective . Good health , Teddy knew , was an absolute good . Not many things were . He knew this because he 'd recently been forced to confront its evil twin , bad health  --  an incredibly clarifying experience he was eager not to repeat . <p> Well , he thought , get used to it . From here on life was a numbers game , an actuarial box score . Weight , body fat , heart rate , cholesterol , PSA . Fortunately he had a gift for numbers . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you . Look at Philip : his numbers had been okay too . So had Don Blackburn 's , and look at him : a stroke like a bolt from the blue . <p> Of course in Don 's case factors of nature and nurture had to be considered . The man was fifty pounds overweight and did not own so much as a pair of sneakers . Clearly he 'd made few of the compromises with age that Teddy himself had made . Don was still a smoker , a drinker , a gorger , a glutton . On bad days he 'd blow through his classroom like a nor'easter , bushy-browed , all hot wind and pendulous rumbling , clogging up the aisles with his great mounded belly , his arms tossing around like tree limbs , squalls of saliva issuing from the corners of his mouth . That was what happened to English teachers . They grew indulgent as they aged , arch and capricious and mean . Don had long since lost interest in his lesson plans . He 'd stand at the board making jokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dactylic verse  --  <p> Silly Miss Peters has forgotten her binder <p> If only Miss Cobden had thought to remind her . <p> He might have been auditioning for one of those fat , burdened fools  --  Falstaff , Lear , Willy Loman  --  he was always requisitioning buses and handing out permission slips to take his students to see . Don too was a mess . His face a checkerboard of distress , at once pallid and overripe ; his eyes like dry wells sunk deep in his cheeks . He had never seemed all that healthy in the best of times , and it had not been the best of times for Don Blackburn , not in a long while . Now he was into the other times , the worst of times . Now you could feel the furnace of his loneliness roaring in his belly , steaming up the storm windows , pouring through the vents . <p> Think in terms of forgiving me everything , Don would say in his cups . God knows I do . <p> And Teddy had . Selflessly and tolerantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drunken phone calls , the retributive rants , the mawkish apologies  --  not because selfless , tolerant endurance of other people 's moods was one of Teddy 's specialties , though it was ; not because he and Don were vaguely related by marriage , though they were ; not because they 'd successfully worked together at the middle school for twenty years now , though they had ; or because , like most people , Teddy found both instruction and entertainment in other people 's tragedies , though he did  --  no , he endured them because he genuinely liked Don , and feared him , and pitied him , and felt vaguely protective of him , and , though he did not like to dwell on this , vaguely guilty toward him as well . Three years before , after a successful production of Guys and Dolls , he 'd walked petite , unsmiling Vera Blackburn out to her car and wound up kissing her smack on the mouth . Right there in the parking lot , under the fizzy halo of the sodium lights ! Christ alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the cheek . But Vera was so short , and Teddy was so tall , and his big , lumbering weight kept moving downward as if of its own volition , the white lines of the parking grid blurring at his feet , and suddenly Vera 's fine dark hair was slipping its braid , her split ends whisking like feathers against his cheek , and it was as if they 'd begun to sleepwalk their way through some strange , weightless twilight where everything was permissible and nothing quite mattered . Or was it vice versa ? Of course the kiss itself lasted only a moment . And if later Teddy came to regret that kiss for ethical reasons almost as much as he 'd enjoyed it at the time for aesthetic ones , on balance he was grateful for it , for the wealth of that deposit in his memory , and for the warm , tangeriney taste of Vera 's lips , which remained with him as he sailed home that night in his purring Accord . All the lights were with him . Signs bowed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shops and their awnings fell away behind him , folding up like stage flats . As if this social world with its painted signs were only another amateurish set , waiting to be struck . When he got home that night he drank a little bourbon and let Bruno out to do his business , to approach and avoid the invisible fence that ringed the yard ; and then he turned off the porch light , put his glass in the sink , and went upstairs to have his way with his own lawful sleeping wife . And that was that . Not long after , Vera Blackburn moved to San Francisco and opened a maternity boutique , ripping a small tear in the social fabric through which the weather poured in on them all . <p> It was the sort of bad luck Don was famous for . People said you made your own luck and Teddy supposed that was true up to a point  --  it was why he ran on the treadmill like this every morning  --  but the point was not as flexible as it used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were fifty-two . Fifty- three . <p> His heart thudded against his ribs . His right knee was showing signs of meniscus fatigue . He felt a surge in the current , a kind of electrical empathy , as if he and the treadmill were old running partners huffing their way home , and not a man alone in an insulated basement with $700 worth of sporting equipment . He gripped the handles hard , holding on . Goddamnit , here was a position he could hold : not stillness , but motion ; not tranquillity , but noisy , pounding labor . Blind persistence . Putting one foot in front of the other , again and again , while the rubberized mat unfurled beneath him like the flattest , most unvarying of rivers . This he could do . Never mind his recent trials , both medical and legal . Never mind the school board . Never mind that Gail had failed to present him with a birthday present at dinner , and that there was no present from his daughters either , or for that matter no card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a greedy and dependent child , mooning after the attention of his loved ones , but a vigorous , determined adult of fifty-two . Fifty- three ... <p> Finally he 'd had enough and flicked off the machine . His towel smelled salty and rank ; his shirt clung to his ribs like a second skin . He left it there , rolled up on his chest , like an animal skin half-molted . Water rushed through the pipes overhead . Mimi taking her shower . By the time she was finished the hot water would be depleted , the mirror lost in steam , the bar of Lifebuoy slim as a wafer . What an uphill battle it was , getting yourself clean . <p> Now he heard Gail 's footsteps in the kitchen . The dull whine of the coffee grinder , the ticking of Bruno 's paws across the floor . Mimi would be down in a few minutes , wet-haired and irritable , unhappy with her clothes . Gail , looking up from one or another domestic task she seemed increasingly ambivalent about performing , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not-so-affectionate joke  --  after which with astonishing but not unprecedented suddenness Mimi would wind up in tears . There would be slammed drawers , and operatic threats and complaints , and inevitably a portion of breakfast would succumb to gravity and find its way to the floor , where bony old Bruno would trot over to lick it up . That was how it would go . The dog 's presence at their feet , his goofy and enduring goodness , would allow for a truce . Then the room would grow still . Then after a while the stillness itself would become a problem , as stillness does . Dad 's absence would be remarked upon by both parties , if not resented , if not singled out for blame for pretty much everything that was wrong . Such were the statistical probabilities of the morning . The coffee , the newspaper , the fruit shakes , the fights , the dog , the blame , the toast . The rituals of a household patiently assembling itself . Making its own luck . <p> Ten more sit-ups , Teddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Robert Cohen <br> Continues ...
