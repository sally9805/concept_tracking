Section : Money &; Business The red-hot housing market reminds some of the latter days of the 1990s stock market . How will it end ? <p> Ken Wu and Alan Koder figure they got in just in time . Eager to buy their first homes before skyrocketing real-estate values in San Diego priced them out of the market , two years ago the friends each bought houses in up-and-coming neighborhoods . <p> " All I could afford was a fixer-upper , " Wu , 31 , says of the modest 1,500-square-foot house he purchased near downtown for $360,000 in 2002 . " It seemed like a ridiculous price . But I figured if I did a little work on it , I could add value . " <p> The sweat equity he put into painting it , installing a skylight , and replacing rotted flooring surely helped . But the real bang for his buck came not from his efforts but from those of a flood of buyers who followed in his footsteps . In a similar rush to get in before prices  --  and interest rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has since bid up the price of San Diego real estate by about 50 percent in just two years . " It 's pretty amazing , " says Wu , a financial analyst , of the $550,000 he believes his home would now fetch . " I thought I was buying at the top of the market , but there are houses just down the street that people are flipping for even more . " <p> Koder has n't done so badly , either . " I figure my place is worth about $500,000 now , " the 27-year-old biologist says of the $330,000 suburban house he bought with a 10 percent down payment and an adjustable-rate mortgage , giving him a total two-year return on his money of more than 500 percent , at least on paper . " I always knew real estate was a good investment . I just did n't know it was this good . " <p> Convinced there is more money to be made , last summer the two formed a real-estate-investment club with another friend and purchased a pair of condominiums in Las @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each . The rent they receive does n't quite cover the mortgage payments . But they figure their real-estate gamble has already paid off " because the market there is just exploding , " says Koder , who estimates that the condos have already increased in value by as much as $30,000 each . " We were figuring on about 8 percent appreciation a year , but I bet it 'll be more . " <p> Such outsize expectations hardly seem out of line these days . After one of the broadest and longest run-ups in housing prices ever , most homeowners are sitting pretty . But there is a growing angst about how much longer the party can go on . Those who believe housing is now the new " bubble , " much like the ' 90s stock market , point to slowing sales and rising interest rates amid nosebleed prices that have far outpaced growth in personal income . Take Las Vegas , for example , where the median home price has increased an eye-popping 54 percent in the past 12 months alone . <p> And while much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modest gains , red-hot coastal markets in California and the Boston-to-Washington , D.C. , corridor , as well as in southeast Florida , have pushed up the national median sales price by more than 7 percent in the past year , three times faster than household income . <p> Lofty expectations . That said , interest rates remain low by historic standards , and the economy is growing at a steady , if not spectacular , pace . And while prices continue their upward spiral , it 's little wonder a growing number of acquisitive home buyers , including speculative investors like Wu and Koder , expect prices in places like Southern California to continue their surge . In a recent Yale University survey of home buyers in Los Angeles , for example , respondents said they expected their homes to increase by an average of 22 percent annually over the next decade , while more than two thirds said they feared being left out of the boom if they did n't buy now . Recent buyers in Boston and San Francisco were similarly exuberant , expecting 13.2 percent and 17.9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had been anxious to get in before prices rose further . <p> Yet it is precisely that combination of greed and fear of being left behind that could pop what some experts believe is a dangerously inflated housing bubble in some parts of the country . " It 's the same sort of irrational behavior that helped inflate the stock market bubble of the 1990s , " Yale economist Robert J. Shiller , author of the prestock market crash book Irrational Exuberance , says of the survey 's findings . The last time he observed such extravagant expectations was in 1988 , just two years before a housing bust that saw prices in Los Angeles drop by 40 percent in real terms and by about 20 percent in San Francisco and Boston in the early 1990s . Before that swoon , he says , buyers voiced many of the same attitudes they do today : that houses are the best long-run financial investment , with a big upside and relatively little risk . <p> In cocktail party chatter reminiscent of the days when housewives and taxi drivers confidently traded stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamentals , Shiller believes . " The typical simplistic view is that it 's just supply and demand , " he says . " That where they live is such a wonderful place and that since there is n't enough land for everyone , prices have nowhere to go but up . " <p> In truth , sprawling housing developments across the country attest to the housing industry 's ability to readily supply the demand , and then some . Last year alone , America 's builders started construction on about 2 million homes , nearly twice the number of households the country added . Meanwhile , growth of so-called exurbs in outlying areas demonstrates Americans ' willingness to commute more than 50 miles one way to buy where prices are more affordable . Even in crowded places like Miami , a building boom that has transformed once moribund inner-city neighborhoods into massive construction zones is expected to add 25,000 condos in the next year and a half  --  about five times the number sold last year . <p> Space crunch . To be sure , physical limits to growth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City 's Central Park are real . As the old adage goes , " The key to real estate is location , location , location , " says Patricia Whitehead , an associate broker with New York 's Corcoran Group , which estimates that the average price for a condominium in Lower Manhattan has surged by nearly 80 percent since 2000 , to more than $880,000 . " This island is only so big . " <p> That may be true . But a lack of available housing did n't stop real-estate prices from plummeting there amid the economic downturn that followed the 1987 stock market crash . That 's when Sheryl Lieberman bought her first apartment in Manhattan for $230,000 . Six years later , a friend in the same building sold a similar apartment . " It was two flights higher , so it should have been worth more than my place . But she only got $160,000 , " recalls the 45-year-old financial adviser . " People forget that what goes up can also come down . Like right now , they think real estate ca n't fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then came the late 1980s . " <p> Convinced the New York City market is overpriced , she recently decided to sell the apartment where she now lives on Midtown 's Sutton Place and rent for a while . " I may not be selling at the top of the market , " she says of the sum she received , which is nonetheless about triple what she paid for the apartment in 1996 . " But as inflation picks up , you 'll see interest rates go up , too . And as a direct result , real-estate prices are going to go down . " <p> Lieberman does n't expect an outright crash in the market . " But having been an investment professional for the past 23 years , I 've seen the cycles come and go , " she says . " And we 're near the end of one now . " <p> Predicting exactly when a financial bubble will burst is next to impossible . That 's partly because it 's so hard to account for the vagaries of human psychology : how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expects ) and what will it take to make them panic ( often , far less than is rational ) . Yet there is mounting evidence that things are getting out of whack . In addition to buyers ' increasingly unrealistic expectations of appreciation , one worrisome sign is the surging gap between housing price increases and growth in personal income . <p> Trusty real estate . Until recently , the run-up in housing prices roughly tracked increases in personal income . But that relationship , long considered a bellweather for judging housing affordability , began to change a few years ago as the recession put a lid on workers ' salary increases yet failed to dampen their demand for homes . Burned by the stock market debacle , many Americans turned to real estate as a safe investment . Even if a home was n't the " next big thing , " at least it would n't turn into a worthless scrap of paper . Buyers were enabled , in part , by record low interest rates and a growing menu of adjustable-rate and interest-only mortgages that allowed people like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving existing homeowners the buying power to trade up . Low home equity loan rates , too , sent others on a remodeling binge that may have increased their homes ' values but put them further in debt . <p> For much of the past 30 years , median home prices in the United States remained between 2.7 and 2.9 times Americans ' median household income . In other words , if you spent every dime you earned to pay off your house ( not including interest ) , you 'd do it in about three years . But starting in 2000 , that ratio began climbing to about 3.4 times personal income . In relatively subdued markets like Pittsburgh and Milwaukee , it remains closer to the historic norm . In the hot markets like San Diego , however , where prices have doubled since 2000 while income has increased by only 10 percent , the cost of houses approaches 10 times what buyers earn each year . <p> At a 5 percent annual interest rate , that represents a mortgage payment of about half of your household income . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped going out to dinner and cut back on travel , " says Shiller . " But what if you have an adjustable-rate mortgage , and we get an oil shock that pushes interest rates way up ? Then you 've got a major family crisis . " <p> That 's exactly the predicament a growing number of home buyers could face . As of last month , more than a third of those buying homes financed them with adjustable-rate mortgages  --  up from just 12 percent three years ago  --  mostly because they feature lower payments than fixed-rate mortgages do ( at least initially ) , allowing buyers to qualify for homes they might not otherwise be able to afford . In hot markets like San Diego and New York City , as many as half of all buyers are now using such strategies to get into their dream houses . <p> That is why some experts believe an interest rate spike could be the pin that pops the housing bubble . In the best-case scenario ( one already underway since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins to cool demand as buyers find they ca n't afford to pay top dollar . Sellers unwilling to accept lower offers hold out , increasing the inventory of unsold homes over time and eventually forcing sellers to begin lowering prices . In such a case , " it 's not going to be a free fall , " housing economist Celia Chen of Economy.com says of forecasts that call for slowing price increases over the next year or two , followed by a small decrease in prices for a few quarters . " We see up to about an 8 percent decline in the overpriced areas . " <p> Far scarier , however , would be an oil price shock , a rapid decline in the U.S. dollar , or ever mounting budget deficits ( or all three ) , which could force the Fed to aggressively raise interest rates to stave off inflation . That could quickly bring the real-estate market to a standstill . As higher rates begin to affect homeowners ' ability to pay their adjustable-rate mortgages , some will be forced into foreclosure while others who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Even those with fixed-rate mortgages could find themselves in trouble if circumstances force them to sell into a declining market . ) Banks will be left holding the bag , as will Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the nation 's largest purchasers of mortgage debt . If they stumble , " we will be looking at trillions of dollars of losses and a major recession or a possible banking crisis , " says economic consultant John R. Talbott , who predicts such a meltdown in his book The Coming Crash in the Housing Market . <p> Most experts think that scenario is unlikely . Yet even some longtime real-estate boosters are proceeding with caution . Take real-estate analyst Sanford Goodkin , who three years ago decided to sell his large house in Del Mar , just north of San Diego , and downsize to a condo , in part out of concern that the market had become overheated as hordes of speculators bid up prices . " My rule of thumb is when 15 percent of sales are to speculators , you 're in trouble , " says Goodkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 20 percent by now . " <p> David Shulman would n't just downsize . " If it was only an economic decision , I 'd sell and rent for a while , " says Shulman , who oversees real-estate equity research for Lehman Brothers in New York . The only thing stopping him : " my wife . She 'd divorce me if I sold our place . " <p> To be sure , a house is as much an emotional investment as it is a financial one . And even Shulman and Goodkin say those who buy and hold for the long term are n't likely to lose their shirts . That said , " anyone who can wait should , " says Shulman . And those who ca n't " absolutely should lock in a fixed-rate loan , " Goodkin says of 30-year mortgages that are still below 6 percent . " It 's wonderful insurance that can protect you over the long run . " <p> It 's advice even gamblers like Wu have taken to heart . Although he purchased his San Diego home with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My parents think I 'm going to go broke , " he says of his real-estate investments . " But I ran the numbers , and I feel like even if the worst-case scenario happens , I 'd only be losing maybe $500 a month , which is the equivalent of buying a new Bimmer BMW . And at least my real estate will appreciate . " <p> Or so he hopes . UP , UP , AND AWAY <p> Most of the country is seeing a housing boom , but some places have seen a small decline . <p> Top number : Percentage change in median house prices in the third quarter of 2004 vs. the third quarter in 2003 . <p> Bottom number : Median house price in 2003 , in thousands .
