<p> Unable to quell the violence that pushed Oakland 's homicide rate to a seven-year high last year , Mayor Jerry Brown has pointed a finger at state prisons for dumping unprepared , unreformed parolees back on the city 's streets . <p> " That is a total reversal of what used to be the practice in California , " Brown said in his state-of-the-city address last month . " Under the indeterminate sentencing law , an inmate did not get even a date , let alone get released , unless there was a plan for a job , housing and where this individual was going . " <p> What Brown has failed to mention is that he played a critical role in instituting the system that has now drawn his ire . <p> As California 's governor more than 25 years ago , Brown signed the law scrapping indeterminate sentencing , trading the longtime system in which inmates had to prove they were ready to leave prison for one in which most prisoners simply walk out the door when their time is up . <p> Now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " move back toward more indeterminacy in the sentencing process " that could include mandatory education and job training for prisoners . <p> ' YOU TRY SOMETHING ELSE ' <p> " Just because you tried something does n't mean you ca n't reverse it , " Brown told The Chronicle when asked about his about-face . " If it does n't work , you try something else . ( Otherwise ) that 's a formula for stagnation . " <p> Jerome Skolnick , a criminologist and law professor at New York University , called Brown 's reversal ironic . <p> " A governor does n't deal with crime . He deals with the corrections system . A mayor deals with crime , " Skolnick said . " Jerry Brown is in a position as mayor where he has to deal with crime , and he realizes this was a big mistake . " <p> When Brown became governor in 1975 , indeterminate sentencing had been the foundation of the state 's prison system for nearly 60 years . Convicted criminals were given broad sentences  --  such as five years to life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were rehabilitated and ready for release , with a plan for life on the outside . <p> But the system was coming under fire from all sides . Prisoners and their advocates said the parole board 's decisions were arbitrary , even racist . Prison officials said sentences with no end in sight were fueling frustration and violence in prisons . And academics said there was no evidence the state 's efforts at rehabilitation worked . <p> As the state Legislature began debating changes to the law , Brown 's administration took matters into its own hands and started issuing fixed release dates for prisoners using formulas based on the average time served for particular crimes . <p> LEGISLATURE STEPS IN <p> Those administrative changes were later thrown out by the courts , paving the way for the Legislature to pass the bill replacing indeterminate sentencing with fixed or determinate sentences , which Brown signed . <p> While supporters far outnumbered critics , those in opposition feared that fixed sentences would mean the release of dangerous criminals and an end to rehabilitation , with the incentive of early release removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The law , in fact , changed the purpose of the prison system from rehabilitation to punishment . <p> Brown was among those questioning whether rehabilitation worked . " I think you should rehabilitate jails , not people , " he said at the time . <p> " I was skeptical about state social engineering of human beings , " Brown said in a recent interview . " I 'm impressed with people 's free will and persistence in whatever behaviors they choose . " <p> But Brown is now contemplating whether inmates should be required to participate in rehabilitation programs , ranging from education to vocational training . He is working with state Sen. Don Perata , D-Oakland , on legislation to be introduced this session . <p> Brown said the sheer number of prisoners  --  which has grown from 22,000 in 1975 to 161,000 today  --  and the fact that 71 percent of California 's inmates land back in prison within 18 months , dictates that something be done . More than 125,000 prisoners were released last year . <p> " My minimum position is that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who will equip themselves with skills that will enable them to get off this merry-go-round , " he said . " They come out , they 've got a seventh-grade education . All they know how to do is sell dope and hustle . " <p> Brown set his sights on the prisons last year after Oakland voters rejected his proposal to raise taxes to pay for 100 new police officers . <p> CRIME STATISTICS <p> Oakland police estimate that ex-convicts on state parole or probation from county jail committed 50 percent of all crimes and 80 percent of violent crimes in the city last year . <p> Nearly 1 in 5 of last year 's 113 homicide victims was on parole , as were 14 percent of the suspects arrested . The numbers nearly triple if those on probation are included . <p> " There are some pretty serious public-safety consequences as a result " of ending indeterminate sentencing , said Joan Petersilia , a criminology professor at UC Irvine . " It was probably one of the biggest mistakes we in the California criminal justice community made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> While Petersilia lobbied for the change at the time , she now advocates a return to indeterminate sentencing and a re-emphasis on rehabilitation programs , which she said are sorely lacking in California 's prisons . <p> Under state law , all able-bodied prisoners already are required to work or participate in education or substance-abuse programs , said Margot Bach , a spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections . <p> But " unfortunately , it 's not the reality . We probably have more inmates who would like to work than we have places for them , " Bach said . And " you can not force someone to take academic programs . " <p> About half of all inmates were in jobs or training in December , according to corrections figures . Some 35 percent are ineligible for programs for security , health and other reasons , officials said . <p> Thirty percent of all prisoners held jobs ranging from making furniture to eyeglasses for the Prison Industry Authority to working as clerks or gardeners . Nine percent participated in more than 65 vocational training programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in academic courses , including literacy and GED programs , and 5 percent were in drug treatment . <p> But nearly 21,000 inmates were on waiting lists for jobs and programs , nearly 20 percent of those eligible , bolstering the argument of Brown and other prison critics that there are not enough programs . Only 3,557 inmates earned their GED in 2001 . <p> Inmates are paid for prison jobs and can earn time off their sentences for participating in both jobs and programs , but they still are required to serve 50 percent of sentences for nonviolent crimes and 85 percent for violent crimes , Bach said . <p> Critics say it is not enough incentive to get prisoners into meaningful activities . <p> Brown also has said too little is done to prepare inmates for release , compared with the previous system in which the parole board reviewed an " extensive evaluation document " before letting a prisoner go home . <p> " They do n't make them have a re-entry plan . They do n't give them a game plan , " Brown said . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to Raul Romero , assistant superintendent of correctional education for the Corrections Department , more than 46,000 inmates participated in a three- to six-week re-entry course covering topics from money management to searching for a job , about 36 percent of those paroled in 2001 . But Petersilia said the quality of those programs varies and can be little more than a video no one is watching . The effectiveness of the programs is certainly called into question by the fact that nearly three-fourths of those released will be jailed again . <p> " There 's been a lot of anti-crime rhetoric , " Brown said . " It has resulted in hundreds and thousands of people being detained in prisons and jails where they learn to become even more effective and , in many instances , more dangerous criminals .
