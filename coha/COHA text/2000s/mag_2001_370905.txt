When James Thomson learned last week that President Bush was about to make his big decision on stem cells , he coolly decided to do what he had planned to do all along . The once obscure University of Wisconsin scientist had triggered the great debate over embryonic stem cells . And so , on the morning after listening to the President 's speech at a neighbor 's house ( " I do n't have television , " Thomson says . " I just watch DVDs on my computer " ) , he blithely went off hang-gliding in the hills near Madison . Good thing . As the lab Merlin who was first to create the magical cells in a Petri dish , Thomson knew his telephone would be jangling after the President 's pronouncement . " I thought it better to clear my head before facing the media storm , " he says , leaving calls unanswered . <P> Though somewhat disappointed with the restriction on creating new cell lines  --  he 's cultivating five right now  --  he 's generally pleased with the Bush decision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be limited to just a few labs , even if there are only a few dozen cell lines , " he says . " That 's the most important thing . " Such altruistic concern for the progress of his chosen science is characteristic of the man . Even before he was caught in the limelight , he went about his experiments so conscientiously that they set the ethical standard by which all research in the field is measured . <P> In November 1998 , when he was just nudging 40 , he not only succeeded in culling stem cells from " surplus " embryos created at fertility clinics but also kept them alive and reproducing indefinitely . In effect , he stopped their biological clocks by preventing the cells from morphing into different tissues , as they would in undisturbed embryos . In the jargon of cell research , they were immortal . Only a few days later , fellow stem-cell researcher John Gearhart of Johns Hopkins University published word that he had succeeding in cultivating a line of stem cells from the germ cells of aborted fetuses  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall race . <P> These were astonishing achievements . For the first time , scientists had access to a cornucopia of undifferentiated cells that can grow into any one of the 200 or so cell types that make up a human being . That opened the door to remarkable possibilities , including replacement cells for malfunctioning pancreases , injured spinal cords and plaque-clogged brains . It also brought stern warnings . Though the sacrificed embryos were no more than hollow , pinhead-size clusters of a few dozen cells , destroying them for whatever purpose represented , in the mind of many antiabortion conservatives , an assault on a human life . <P> Thomson , a tall and rumpled Ichabod Crane , is ill cast as a lightning rod . A developmental biologist at the University of Wisconsin 's primatology center , he traces his passion for science to an inspirational rocket-scientist uncle . Imagine , the uncle once told him about his work for NASA , " they pay me to do this . "                 @ @ @ @
