On my forty-ninth birthday , I decided that all of life was hopeless , and I would eat myself to death . These are desert days . Better to go out by our own hands than to endure slow death by scolding at the hands of the Bush administration . However , after a second cup of coffee , I realized that I could n't kill myself that morning-not because it was my birthday but because I 'd promised to get arrested the next day . I had been arrested three weeks earlier with an ecumenical bunch of religious peaceniks , people who still believe in Dr. King and Gandhi . Also , my back was out . I did n't want to die in crone mode . Plus , there was no food in the house . So I took a long , hot shower instead and began another day of being gloated to death . // Everyone I know has been devastated by Bush 's presidency and , in particular , our country 's heroic military activities overseas . I can usually manage a crabby hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more will be revealed , and that truth and beauty will somehow win out in the end . But I 'd been struggling as my birthday approached . So much had been stolen from us by Bush , from the very beginning of his reign , and especially since he went to war in Iraq . I wake up some mornings pinned to the bed by centrifugal sadness and frustration . A friend called to wish me Happy Birthday , and I remembered something she 'd said many years ago , while reading a Vanity Fair article about Hitler 's affair with his niece . " I have had it with Hitler , " Peggy said vehemently , throwing the magazine to the floor . And I 'd had it with Bush . // Had n't the men in the White House ever heard of the word karma ? They lied their way into taking our country to war , crossing another country 's borders with ferocious military might , trying to impose our form of government on a sovereign nation , without any international agreement or legal justification , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscenely , rich . Then we 're instructed , like naughty teenagers , to refrain from saying that it was an immoral war that set a disastrous precedent-because to do so is to offer aid and comfort to the enemy . // While I was thinking about all this , my Jesuit friend Father Tom called . He is one of my closest friends , a few years older than I , a scruffy aging Birkenstock type , like me , who gives lectures and leads retreats on spirituality . Usually he calls to report on the latest rumors of my mental deterioration , drunkenness , or promiscuity , how sick it makes everyone to know that I am showing all my lady parts to the neighbors . But this time he called to wish me Happy Birthday . // " How are we going to get through this craziness ? " I asked . There was silence for a moment . // " Left foot , right foot , left foot , breathe , " he said . // Father Tom loves the desert . A number of my friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinity , like the ocean . They love the silence , and how , if you listen long enough , the pulse of the desert begins to sound like the noise your finger makes when you run it around the rim of a crystal glass . They love the scary beauty-snakes , lizards , scorpions , the kestrels and hawks . They love the mosaics of water-washed pebbles on the desert floor , small rocks that cast huge shadows , a shoot of vegetation here , a wildflower there . // I like the desert for short periods of time , from inside a car , with the windows rolled up and the doors locked . I prefer beach resorts with room service . But liberals have been in the desert for several years now , and I 'm worn out . Some days I hardly know what to pray for . Peace ? Well , whatever . // So the morning of my birthday , because I could n't pray , I did what Matisse once said to do : " I do n't know if I believe in God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oneself in a frame of mind which is close to that of prayer . " I closed my eyes , and got quiet . I tried to look like Mother Mary , with dreadlocks and a bad back . // But within seconds , I was frantic to turn on the TV . I was in withdrawal-I needed more scolding from Donald Rumsfeld , and more malignant celebration of what everyone agreed , in April 2003 , was a great victory for George W. Bush . So we could n't find those stupid weapons of mass destruction-pick , pick , pick . I did n't turn on the TV . I kept my eyes closed , and breathed . I started to feel crazy , and knew that all I needed was five minutes of CNN . I listened to the birds sing outside , and it was like Chinese water torture , which I am sure we do n't say anymore . Then I remembered the weekend when 11 million people in the world marched for peace , how joyful it was to be part of the stirrings of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace is joy at rest , and joy is peace on its feet , and I felt both that weekend . // I lay on the floor with my eyes closed for so long that my dog , Lily , came over and worriedly licked me back to life . That cheered me up . " What did you get me for my birthday ? " I asked . She started to chew on my head . That helped . Maybe the old left is dead , but after we 've rested awhile we can prepare for something new . I do n't know who on the left can lead us away from the craziness and barbarity : I 'm very confused now . But I know that in the desert , you stay out of the blistering sun . You go out during the early morning , and in the cool of the evening . You seek oasis , shade , safety , refreshment . There 's every hue of green , and of gold . But I 'm only pretending to think it 's beautiful ; I find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my breath . // I called Tom back . // He listened quietly . I asked him for some good news . // He thought . " Well , " he said finally , " My cactuses are blooming . Last week they were ugly and reptilian , and now they are bursting with red and pink blossoms . They do n't bloom every year , so you have to love them while they 're here . " // " I hate cactuses , " I said . " I want to know what to do . Where we even start . " // " We start by being kind to ourselves . We breathe , we eat . We remember that God is present wherever people stiffer . God 's here with us when we 're miserable , and God is there in Iraq . The suffering of innocent people draws God close to them . Kids hit by U.S. bombs are not abandoned by God . " // " Well , it sure looks like they were , " I said . " It sure looks that way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ had been abandoned on the cross . It looked like a win for the Romans . " // " How do we help ? How do we not lose our minds ? " // " You take care of the suffering . " // " I ca n't get to Iraq . " // " There are folks who are miserable here . " // After we got off the phone , I ate a few birthday chocolates . Then I asked God to help me be helpful . It was the first time that day that I felt my prayers were sent , and then received-like e-mail . I tried to cooperate with grace , which is to say , I did not turn on the TV . I asked God to help me again . The problem with God-or at any rate , one of the top five most annoying things about God-is that fie or She rarely answers right away . It can take days , weeks . Some people seem to understand this-that life and change take time . Chou En-lai , when asked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused for a minute-smoking incessantly-then replied , " Too soon to tell . " I , on the other hand , am an instant-message type . It took decades for Bush to destroy , the Iraqi army in three weeks . // But I prayed : Help me . And then I drove to the market in silence , to buy my birthday dinner . // I flirted with everyone in the store , especially the old people , and I lightened up . When the checker finished ringing up my items , she looked at my receipt and cried , " Hey ! You 've won a ham . " // I felt blindsided by the news . I had asked for help , not a ham . This was very disturbing . What on earth was I going to do with ten pounds of salty pink eraser ? I rarely eat it . It makes you bloat. // " Wow , " I said . The checker was so excited about giving it to me that I pretended I was , too . // How great ! // A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetch my ham . I stood waiting anxiously . I wanted to go home , so I could start caring for suffering people , or turn on CNN . I almost suggested that the checker award the ham to the next family who paid with food stamps . But for some reason , I waited . If God was giving me a ham , I 'd be crazy not to receive it . Maybe it was the ham of God , who takes away the sins of the world . // I waited ten minutes for what I began to think of as " that fucking ham . " Finally the bag boy handed me a parcel the size of a cat . I put it with feigned cheer into my grocery cart , and walked to the car , trying to figure out who might need it . I thought about chucking the parcel out the window near a field . I was so distracted that I crashed my cart smack into a slow-moving car in the parking lot . // I started to apologize , when I noticed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old friend was at the wheel . We got sober together a long time ago , and each of us had a son at the same time . She has dark black skin and processed hair the color of cooled tar . // She opened her window . " Hey , " I said . " How are you-it 's my birthday ! " // " Happy Birthday , " she said , and started crying . She looked drained and pinched , and after a moment , she pointed to her gas gauge . " I do n't have money for gas , or food . I 've never asked for help from a friend since I got sober , but I 'm asking you to help me. " // " I 've got money , " I said . // " No , no , I just need gas , " she said . " I 've never asked someone for a handout . " // " It 's not a handout , " I told her . " It 's my birthday present . " I thrust a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then I reached into my shopping cart and held out the ham to her like a clown offering flowers . " Hey ! " I said . " Do you and your kids like ham ? " // " We love it , " she said . " We love it for every meal . " // She put it in the seat beside her , firmly , lovingly , as if she were about to strap it in . And she cried some more . // Later , thinking about her , I remembered the seasonal showers in the desert , how potholes in the rocks fill up with rain . When you look later , there are already flogs in the water , and brine shrimp reproducing , like commas doing the macarena ; and it seems , but only seems , that you went from parched to overflow in the blink of an eye . //
