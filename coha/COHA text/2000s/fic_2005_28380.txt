1 Darkness was encroaching on Cato Neimoidia 's western hemisphere , though exchanges of coherent light high above the beleaguered world ripped looming night to shreds . Well under the fractured sky , in an orchard of manax trees that studded the lower ramparts of Viceroy Gunray 's majestic redoubt , companies of clone troopers and battle droids were slaughtering one another with bloodless precision . A flashing fan of blue energy lit the undersides of a cluster of trees : the lightsaber of Obi-Wan Kenobi . Attacked by two sentry droids , Obi-Wan stood his ground , twisting his upraised blade right and left to swat blaster bolts back at his enemies . Caught midsection by their own salvos , both droids came apart , with a scattering of alloy limbs . Obi-Wan moved again . Tumbling under the segmented thorax of a Neimoidian harvester beetle , he sprang to his feet and raced forward . Explosive light shunted from the citadel 's deflector shield dappled the loamy ground between the trees , casting long shadows of their buttressed trunks . Oblivious to the chaos occurring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalwart march toward a mound that supported the fortress . In their cutting jaws or on their upsweeping backs they carried cargoes of pruned foliage . The crushing sounds of their ceaseless gnawing provided an eerie cadence to the rumbling detonations and the hiss and whine of blaster bolts . From off to Obi-Wan 's left came a sudden click of servos ; to his right , a hushed cry of warning . " Down , Master ! " He dropped into a crouch even before Anakin 's lips formed the final word , lightsaber aimed to the ground to keepfrom impaling his onrushing former Padawan . A blur of thrumming blue energy sizzled through the humid air , followed by a sharp smell of cauterized circuitry , the tang of ozone . A blaster discharged into soft soil , then the stalked , elongated head of a battle droid struck the ground not a meter from Obi-Wan 's feet , sparking as it bounced and rolled out of sight , repeating : " Roger , roger . . . Roger , roger . . . " In a tuck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the droid 's spindly body collapse . The fact that Anakin had saved his life was nothing new , but Anakin 's blade had passed a little too close for comfort . Eyes somewhat wide with surprise , he came to his feet . " You nearly took my head off . " Anakin held his blade to one side . In the strobing light of battle his blue eyes shone with wry amusement . " Sorry , Master , but your head was where my lightsaber needed to go . " Master . Anakin used the honorific not as learner to teacher , but as Jedi Knight to Jedi Council member . The braid that had defined his earlier status had been ritually severed after his audacious actions at Praesitlyn . His tunic , knee-high boots , and tight-fitting trousers were as black as the night . His face scarred from a contest with Dooku-trained Asajj Ventress . His mechanical right hand sheathed in an elbow-length glove . He had let his hair grow long the past few months , falling almost to his shoulders now . His face he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defined by a short beard . " I suppose I should be grateful your lightsaber needed to go there , rather than desired to . " Anakin 's grin blossomed into a full-fledged smile . " Last time I checked we were on the same side , Master . " " Still , if I 'd been a moment slower . . . " Anakin booted the battle droid 's blaster aside . " Your fears are only in your mind . " Obi-Wan scowled . " Without a head I would n't have much mind left , now , would I ? " He swept his lightsaber in a flourishing pass , nodding up the alley of manax trees . " After you . " They resumed their charge , moving with the supernatural speed and grace afforded by the Force , Obi-Wan 's brown cloak swirling behind him . Victims of the initial bombardment , scores of battle droids lay sprawled on the ground . Others dangled like broken marionettes from the branches of the trees into which they had been hurled . Areas of the leafy canopy were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and torsos lifted their weapons as the Jedi approached , but Anakin only raised his left hand in a Force push that shoved the droids flat onto their backs . They jinked right , somersaulting under the wide bodies of two harvester beetles , then hurdling a tangle of barbed underbrush that had managed to anchor itself in the otherwise meticulously tended orchard . They emerged from the tree line at the shore of a broad irrigation canal , fed by a lake that delimited the Neimoidians ' citadel on three sides . In the west a trio of wedge-shaped Venator-class assault cruisers hung in scudding clouds . North and east the sky was in turmoil , crosshatched with ion trails , turbolaser beams , hyphens of scarlet light streaming upward from weapons emplacements outside the citadel 's energy shield . Rising from high ground at the end of the peninsula , the tiered fastness was reminiscent of the command towers of the Trade Federation core ships , and indeed had been the inspiration for them . Somewhere inside , trapped by Republic forces , were the Trade Federation elite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Koru Neimoidia devastated , Viceroy Gunray would have been wiser to retreat to the Outer Rim , as other members of the Separatist Council were thought to be doing . But rational thinking had never been a Neimoidian strong suit , especially when possessions remained on Cato Neimoidia the viceroy apparently could n't live without . Backed by a battle group of Federation warships , he had slipped onto Cato Neimoidia , intent on looting the citadel before it fell . But Republic forces had been lying in wait , eager to capture him alive and bring him to justicethirteen years late , in the judgment of many . Cato Neimoidia was as close to Coruscant as Obi-Wan and Anakin had been in almost four standard months , and with the last remaining Separatist strongholds now cleared from the Core and Colonies , they expected to be back in the Outer Rim by week 's end . Obi-Wan heard movement on the far side of the irrigation canal . An instant later , four clone troopers crept from the tree line on the opposite bank to take up firing positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind them a crashed gunship was burning . Protruding from the canopy , the LAAT 's blunt tail was stenciled with the eight-rayed battle standard of the Galactic Republic . A gunboat glided into view from downstream , maneuvering to where the Jedi were waiting . Standing in the bow , a clone commander named Cody waved hand signals to the troopers on shore and to others in the gunboat , who immediately fanned out to create a safe perimeter . Troopers could communicate with one another through the comlinks built into their T-visored helmets , but the Advanced Recon Commando teams had created an elaborate system of gestures meant to thwart enemy attempts at eavesdropping . A few nimble leaps brought Cody face-to-face with Obi-Wan and Anakin . " Sirs , I have the latest from airborne command . " " Show us , " Anakin said . Cody dropped to one knee , his right hand activating a device built into his left wrist gauntlet . A cone of blue light emanated from the device , and a hologram of task force commander Dodonna resolved . " Generals Kenobi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his entourage are making their way to the north side of the redoubt . Our forces have been hammering at the shield from above and from points along the shore , but the shield generator is in a hardened site , and difficult to get at . Gunships are taking heavy fire from turbolaser cannons in the lower ramparts . If your team is still committed to taking Gunray alive , you 're going to have to skirt those defenses and find an alternative way into the palace . At this point we can not reinforce , repeat , can not reinforce . " Obi-Wan looked at Cody when the hologram had faded . " Suggestions , Commander ? " Cody made an adjustment to the wrist projector , and a 3-D schematic of the redoubt formed in midair . " Assuming that Gunray 's fortress is similar to what we found on Deko and Koru , the underground levels will contain fungus farms and processing and shipment areas . There will be access from the shipping areas into the midlevel grub hatcheries , and from the hatcheries we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried a short-stocked DC-15 blaster rifle and wore the white armor and imaging system helmet that had come to symbolize the Grand Army of the Republicgrown , nurtured , and trained on the remote world of Kamino , three years ear- lier . Just now , though , areas of white showed only where there were no smears of mud or dried blood , no gouges , abrasions , or charred patches . Cody 's position was designated by orange markings on his helmet crest and shoulder guards . His upper right arm bore stripes signifying campaigns in which he had participated : Aagonar , Praesitlyn , Paracelus Minor , Antar 4 , Tibrin , Skor II , and dozens of other worlds from Core to Outer Rim . Over the years Obi-Wan had formed battlefield partnerships with several Advanced Recon CommandosAlpha , with whom he had been imprisoned on Rattatak , and Jangotat , on Ord Cestus . Early-generation ARCs had received training by the Mandalorian clone template , Jango Fett . While the Kaminoans had managed to breed some of Fett out of the regulars , they had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a consequence , ARCs displayed more individual initiative and leadership abilities . In short , they were more like the late bounty hunter himself , which was to say , more human . While Cody was n't genetically an Advanced Recon Commando , he had ARC training and shared many ARC attributes . In the initial stages of the war , clone troopers were treated no differently from the war machines they piloted or the weapons they fired . To many they had more in common with battle droids poured by the tens of thousands from Baktoid Armor Workshops on a host of Separatist-held worlds . But attitudes began to shift as more and more troopers died . The clones ' unfaltering dedication to the Republic , and to the Jedi , showed them to be true comrades in arms , and deserving of all the respect and compassion they were now afforded . It was the Jedi themselves , in addition to other progressive thinking officials in the Republic , who had urged that second- and third-generation troopers be given names rather than numbers , to foster a growing fellowship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper levels , Commander , " Obi-Wan said at last . " But how do you propose we reach the fungus farms to begin with ? " Cody stood to his full height and pointed toward the orchards . " we go in with the harvesters . " Obi-Wan glanced uncertainly at Anakin and motioned him off to one side . " It 's just the two of us . What do you think ? " I think you worry too much , Master . " Obi-Wan folded his arms across his chest . " And who 'll worry about you if I do n't ? " Anakin canted his head and grinned . " There are others . " " You can only be referring to See-Threepio . And you had to build him . " " Think what you will . " Obi-Wan narrowed his eyes with purpose . " Oh , I see . But I would have thought Senator Amidala of greater interest to you that Supreme chancellor Palpatine . " Before Anakin could respond , he added : " Despite that she 's a politician also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attract her interest , Master . " Anakin placed his artificial hand on Obi-Wan 's left shoulder . " Perhaps , Master . But then , who would look after you ? "
