ENTERTAINMENT Headnote The TV series ' dark comedy was a paean to the ludicrousness of war Photograph The original cast of the television series ( clockwise from lower left ) : Alan Alda ( Hawkeye Pierce ) , Loretta Swit ( Hot Lips Houlihan ) , Larry Linville ( Frank Burns ) , McLean Stevenson ( Henry Blake ) , Gary Burghoff ( Radar O'Reilly ) , and Wayne Rogers ( Trapper John McIntyre ) . // MEDIA HISTORIAN Rick Mitz credits " M*A*S*H " ( 1972-83 ) with being television 's first dark comedy . As he noted in The Great TV Sitcom Book , " This was a comedy that showed war . Not like a John Wayne epic , but one of small-scale , more human dimensions . " Yet , one should hasten to add , it was a very funny show , too . At its most fundamental , dark comedy ( or black humor ) is a genre of comic irreverence that attacks what are normally society 's most sacredly serious subjects-especially death . This is precisely what " M*A*S*H " did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital , stationed close to the front during the Korean War . Besides attacking the military establishment and the war itself , " M*A*S*H " showcased another pivotal dark comedy component-the inherent absurdity of life . The original producer and founding father of the series , Gene Reynolds , probably stated this position best in David S. Reiss ' 1980 booklength study , M*A*S*H . Likening the program 's inherent absurdity to a existential mindset , he observed : " They 're in the middle of a war where everything is designed to . . . kill . But they 're in the business of putting these bodies back together again , only to have them sent back ... which becomes like shoving a rock up a hill only to have it roll down again . . . " Confronting this apparent futility , " M*A*S*H " ( and black hu- mor in general ) is about coping through comedy . Richard Hornberger , the author of the original 1968 novel ( written under the name Richard Hooker ) , said as much in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war ... produced behavior ... inconsistent with their civilian behavior patterns . A few flipped their lids but most of them just raised dark comedy hell ... " While " M*A*S*H " the novel became a late 1960s bestseller , it was maverick director Robert Altman 's groundbreaking 1970 film adaptation that took a liberal antiwar America by storm . Though set during the Korean War , it was consciously made as a dark comedy statement about the U.S. 's involvement in Vietnam . Indeed , many young fans of the film were all but oblivious to the Korean connection , because the picture so totally seemed to speak to them on the ludicrousness that was Vietnam . As a period footnote to this phenomenon , by someone who saw the film numerous times upon its initial release , the biggest laugh was consistently generated by a line which was very timely to a 1960s draft  --  age audience . Hot Lips ( Sally Kellerman ) asks how anyone like Hawkeye ( Donald Sutherland ) could have reached such a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After " Airport , " " M*A*S*H " was the topgrossing film of 1970 . Not surprisingly , the movie 's parent studio ( Twentieth Century  --  Fox ) decided to cash in on its biggest commercial success in years by adapting the property to television . The studio entrusted the making of a " M*A*S*H " pilot and subsequent series to Reynolds , whose greatest gift to the show arguably was convincing talented comedy writer Larry Gelbart to script both the pilot and the lion 's share of the series ' stories during the first four seasons . All those wonderful wisecracks so synonymous with Alan Alda 's television Hawkeye Pierce came from Gelbart , who initially had honed his comedy skills writing for such celebrated funnymen as Bob Hope and Sid Caesar during television 's early years . Gelbart followed this up with additional successes for the stage and screen . His most memorable credit pre " M*A*S*H " was coauthoring ( with Burt Shevelove ) the longrunning Broadway hit , " A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum . " Reynolds and Gelbart were major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. still very much involved in Vietnam during the series ' debut season ( 1972  --  73 ) , they felt an obligation to continue the darkly comic antiwar essence of the film . Otherwise , there would be a temptation to turn the show into the standard service comedy , such as the sitcom classic , " The Phil Silvers Show " ( 1955-59 ) , wherein Sergeant Bilko and his motor pool gang outmaneuvered everyone at the mythical Army post Fort Baxter . There is nothing wrong with such inspired buffoonery . In fact , the television " M*A*S*H " sometimes emulated Bilko 's con man tendencies via Hawkeye 's huckster schemes . Still , for Reynolds and Gelbart , " M*A*S*H " " s merriment had to come with a message . Photograph In the movie version , Trapper John was played by Elliott Gould ( lett ) , Hot Lips by Sally Kellerman , and Hawkeye by Donald Sutherland . Photograph Throughout the TV series , Trapper John and Hawkeye made the weasel-like Frank Burns the main butt of their often-malicious antics . Max Klinger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character designed to make a one-time appearance , but the gag of his seeking a Section Eight discharge by dressing in women 's clothes proved irresistible to the writers and he became a regular on the show . // Before stating that the TV se- ries " M*A*S*H " was entirely theme ( Vietnam ) - driven ( vs. the character approach of the Silvers show ) , one must note Reynolds ' other major influence on the program-his patiently persistent campaign to bring Alda on board as Hawkeye . Alda had no problem with the property ; he was just a much-sought-after actor . Reynolds was convinced that Alda would make the program , and , of course , he was right . While " M*A*S*H " had other high-pro- file characters come and go during the course of the series ' long run , Alda 's Groucho-like Hawkeye was the primary constant , though Loretta Swit ( " Hot Lips " Houlihan ) and Jamie Farr ( Cpl . Klinger ) also stayed with the show for the entire run . As Gelbart later observed of the actor , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the starting pitcher is always there . Alan Alda has come to represent " M*A*S*H . " " Fittingly , as related to Time magazine ( Feb. 28 , 1983 ) , Alda wanted assurances at the beginning that the war would be treated seriously . He hoped to avoid " making an Abbott &; Costello Go To Korea . ' " Alda later told " M*A*S*H " scholar David S. Reiss what attracted him to the character of Hawkeye : " I really like his passion .... He throws himself into what he does . I like his dedication to his work , his responsibility , and I like his ability to cut through his own seriousness with a self-deprecating joke . " A key war-related example of this latter trait-Hawkeye as antihero-was when he refreshingly allowed himself to show fear , such as the episode where he confessed , " Me scared ? This whole body is one white knuckle . " Besides Hawkeye , most of the other major characters from the film were retained for the series . Instead of the movie 's central trio of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , the television version keyed on just the first two , with Wayne Rogers as Trapper joining Alda . In addition to streamlining the stories , the reduction was not totally inconsistent with the film , since Altman had minimized the use of Duke in the latter half of the movie . The TV series retained villainous buffoon Frank Burns ( Larry Linville ) , unit commander Henry Blake ( McLean Stevenson ) , career army head nurse Margaret " Hot Lips " Houlihan ( Loretta Swit ) , Father Mulcahy ( William Christopher ) , and the company clerk with the almost psychic ability to anticipate breaking events-Cpl . " Radar " O'Reilly ( Gary Burghoff ) . Burghoff was the only actor to reprise his role from the original movie , as the film 's stars-most prominently Sutherland , Elliott Gould ( Trapper John ) , Tom Skerritt ( Duke ) , and Robert Duvall ( Burns )  --  did not join the TV cast . With the writing cooperation of Gelbart , Burghoff took Radar in a more-naive direction for the series . The movie Radar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puck from Shakespeare 's " A Midsummer Night 's Dream . " For instance , the movie Radar was responsible for planting the microphone under Houlihan 's cot the night her lovemaking with Burns was broadcast over the camp 's intercom system , producing her nickname " Hot Lips . " Photograph When Wayne Rogers left the show , he was replaced by Mike Farrell ( center ) as B.J. Hunnicutt , whose sly wit proved a perfect counterpart for Hawkeye 's more-flamboyant exploits . Photograph As Col. Sherman Potter , Henry Morgan ( right ) introduced a more-realistic military aspect to the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital when he replaced Henry Blake as the unit 's commander . // In contrast , the small-screen Radar was a figure of little boy innocence , especially as it pertained to sexuality . As reconceived for the series , Burghoff played Radar as a variation of his first major role-the original Charlie Brown in the Off-Broadway hit " You 're a Good Man , Charlie Brown . " Of course , there was a lot of this gentle naivete in the real Burghoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the " M*A*S*H " characters , to in- corporate part of the actor 's personality into this fictional figure . Burghoff , though , grew increasingly dissatisfied during the later years of the series , ultimately leaving the show before the run ended . The one major character not in the film is Cpl . Max Klinger ( Jamie Farr ) , the soldier forever bucking for a Section Eight discharge ( mental instability ) by donning women 's clothing . Originally created as a one  --  episode character , the zany figure was too good to lose . Klinger was the joint creation of Gelbart ( remembering a Lenny Bruce routine ) and Farr ( drawing upon sketch material he had performed as a late 1950s regular on " The Red Skelton Show " ) . Indeed , one such Skelton program had Farr dressed in women 's clothing and acting very much like Klinger . A shaky beginning As with many now-celebrated television programs , " M*A*S*H " was not an immediate ratings hit , and CBS considered canceling the series during its first season . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1973-74 ) assist by moving it to a dream Saturday scheduling slot between America 's favorite sitcom , " All in the Family , " and the perennially highly rated " Mary Tyler Moore Show . " Suddenly , audiences discovered " M*A*S*H " in a big way , with the Nielsen numbers ranking the program the fourth  --  most-watched series of the season . Impressively , " M*A*S*H " would maintain comparable high ratings for the next decade , even ofter CBS moved the series to a new night ( Tuesday ) for the third season . Coincidently , the close of this third season also produced arguably the most-moving single episode of the series . Stevenson was leaving " M*A*S*H " to develop his own program on rival NBC . He was written out of the program by way of his character , Lt. Col. Blake , having completed his tour of duty . For added dramatic effect , again as it related to war , Reynolds and Gelbart decided Blake would die when his plane was shot down as he was on his way home from Korea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " M*A*S*H " operating room during the final taping of the 1974-75 season , the rest of the cast was hearing it for the first time . Their shocked poignancy was quite real . Appropriately , when TV Guide later surveyed television 's first 50 years for the " 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time " ( July 3 , 1997 ) , the only prominently featured " M*A*S*H " install- ment was the 20th-ranked " Abyssinia , Henry " - the episode in which Blake 's homeward bound plane goes down . With Blake 's moving exit , the series underwent a major change . Like Roger Bowen 's bumbling , ineffectual Blake in the movie , Stevenson 's commander was a silly , non  --  Army type who had not a clue on how to run a : M*A*S*H " unit . Radar was his indispensable guide through the bureaucratic minefield that was day-to-day Army life . Like Hawkeye and Trapper John , Blake essentially represented a drafted mindset best symbolized by the out-of-uniform fishing cap he constantly wore . The replacement of Stevenson 's Blake with Harry Morgan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' dark comedy component . Whereas Blake had been the funny , flirtatious favorite uncle no one took seriously , Potter was an affectionately stem father figure who was ever-so-monogamous . In addition , he was a career officer , having served in two previous conflicts ( World War I and II ) . Because Morgan 's Col. Potter was essentially a very likable leader of men , he made the Army a less darkly comic place . While the series ' primary target remained the ludicrousness of war , the absurdity factor suddenly became more nebulous . Black humor is all about attacking dehumanizing institutions , especially the military establishment , be it " Dr. Strangelove " ( 1964 ) , " Catch-22 " ( 1970 ) , or " M*A*S*H " the movie . Photograph David Ogden Stiers ( left ) , as Charles Emerson Winchester III , proved a much-more-formidable adversary to the machinations of B.J. and Hawkeye , often giving as good as he got . // Unlike a hit movie , a successful television program is a study of the ongoing change known as social history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 1970s , and the small-screen " M*A*S*H reflected that . Moreover , the next major cast defection from the series , the exit of Rogers ' Trapper John at the start of the 1975-76 season , further blunted the black humor edge of the program . Both Trapper and Hawkeye were comparable loose cannons . Ironically , Rogers ' reason for leaving the show was his claim that he had signed as the series star , but the addition of Alda usurped that position  --  creating a frustrating Mexican standoff . Oblivious to this friction , the " M*A*S*H " fan base merely embraced the dual focus ( Trapper and Hawk- eye ) iconoclasm . Or , to paraphrase a classic dark comedy line from the Marx Brothers ' most-inspired outing in " Duck Soup " ( 1933 ) , " Whatever it is , we 're against it . " The free-spirited , hard-drinking , womanizing Hawkeye companion was replaced by Mike Farrell 's squeaky clean Capt . B.J. Hunnicut . Though not a career soldier like Potter , he was cut from the same wholesome cloth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' book might have doubled for Potter 's philosophy : " He 's a man of clear principles  --  whether or not you agree with his principles-and he maintains them . " Granted , these are laudable axioms , but they are just not the " take no prisoners " mindset of dark comedy . Once again , the series was backpedaling from its dark comedy base . The defection of Larry Linville after the 1976-77 season was a more-subtle softening of the anti-Army position . The role he played was a cartoonish , by-the-book Army doctor whose pettiness and hypocrisy made him the constant butt of every Hawkeye and company trick and/or booby trap . Linville defined his character as a dangerous man because " he acts without reason ... with no real knowl- edge or perception of what consequences an action will bring about . " In other words , Burns was the perfect dark comedy target . Bums ' replacement in the 1977-78 season was David Ogden Stiers ' more-three-dimensional Maj. Charles Emerson Winchester III , a stuffy New England elitist whose intelligence necessitated that Hawkeye 's schemes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comic drama , but further defused the anti-Army black humor . While Bums as a comedy target was always linked to his military mindset , Winchester 's shortcomings had nothing to do with the Army , since he had been drafted , too . Instead , Hawkeye and Hunnicut sideswiped his persistent air of superiority . While this author missed the consistent antimilitary position of the early " M*A*S*H , " one might ar- gue that the addition of Winchester broadened the dark comedy target to include the upper classes . Longevity It is important to add that the series ultimately ran almost four times longer than the actual Korean War ( 1950-53 ) . The television " M*A*S*H " would probably not have been able to sustain the original focused dark comedy slant , with which it began over the course of its lengthy run . The greatest credit for this longevity no doubt belonged to the multitalented Alda . Besides representing the quintessential Emmy-winning " M*A*S*H " actor , he would also go on to win statuettes for his writing and directing of individual episodes of the series-an unprecedented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program 's original hard-edged dark comedy , he did encourage an entertaining alternative-the propensity to celebrate individual " M*A*S*H " characters in sort of a feel-good populism . War was still hell , but the later television " M*A*S*H " anticipated an axiom from the revisionist populist movie " Hero " ( 1992 ) : " We 're all heroes , if you catch us at the right time . " It was a more-palatable populism for a modern age tinged with dark comedy . Consequently , with this heightened humanism , the despised Army type Hot Lips became a real person named Margaret . Comic villain Winchester was allowed stories that also gave him a sympathetic sensitive side-an unthinkable development for the previous resident heavy ( Bums ) . When Burghoff left after the 1978-79 season , Klinger became a less  --  controversially comic character , as he was promoted to company clerk . Women 's clothing did not entirely drop out of his wardrobe , but the tendency was definitely toned down . There was even an attempt to create a stateside " M*A*S*H " after the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it followed three members of the original program-Potter , Klinger , and Mulcahy-as their characters returned to semi-normalcy in a veteran 's hospital back home . It lasted just one season ( 1983-84 ) . Through the years , the series " M*A*S*H " became many things to many people . The dark comedy purist can rightfully claim the program became increasingly homogenized with the passage of time . This also occurred during the Marx Brothers ' iconoclastic career . ( The edgy confrontational comedy that is black humor tends to wear out audiences over time . ) Yet , the evolution of " M*A*S*H " ultimately provided a compensating alternative-a modicum of populist hope , a phenomenon normally antithetical to the genre of dark comedy , especially in a war setting . In the ongoing chaos that we call modem times , who am I to argue with hope ?
