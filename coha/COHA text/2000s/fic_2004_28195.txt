Chapter One I have to let this story go . It is with me all the time now , a terrible weight . I sit in the harbor and look across to Smuttynose . A pink light , a stain , makes its way across the island . I cut the engine of the small boat I have rented and put my fingers into the water , letting the shock of the cold swallow my hand . I move my hand through the seawater , and think how the ocean , this harbor , is a repository of secrets , its own elegy . I was here before . A year ago . I took photographs of the island , of vegetation that had dug in against the weather : black sedge and bayberry and sheep sorrel and sea blite . The island is not barren , but it is sere and bleak . It is granite , and everywhere there are ragged reefs that cut . To have lived on Smuttynose would have required a particular tenacity , and I imagine the people then as dug in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rocks like the plants that still survive . The house in which the two women were murdered burned in 1885 , but when I was here a year ago , I photographed the footprint of the house , the marked perimeter . I got into a boat and took pictures of the whitened ledges of Smuttynose and the black-backed gulls that swept and rose above the island in search of fish only they could see . When I was herebefore , there were yellow roses and blackberries . When I was here before , something awful was being assembled , but I did n't know it then . I take my hand from the water and let the drops fall upon the papers in the carton , dampened already at the edges from the slosh . The pink light turns to violet . Sometimes I think that if it were possible to tell a story often enough to make the hurt ease up , to make the words slide down my arms and away from me like water , I would tell that story a thousand times .
