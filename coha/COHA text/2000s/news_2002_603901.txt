<p> Marc Bulger has given the St. Louis Rams salvation and hope . <p> They have given him their gratitude and assurance he 'll be returning to the bench . <p> Having begun the season as the Rams ' No. 3 quarterback , Bulger is on a remarkable run as their starter . He 's 4-0 and the NFL 's No. 1-rated passer even though he never had taken a pro snap before this season . <p> Heck , he did n't start in high school until he was a senior , and he was cut by two NFL teams before landing in St. Louis . <p> The guy who was under center during the Rams ' 0-4 start , then suffered a broken pinkie , happens to have been named the NFL 's most valuable player two of the last three seasons . And now that Kurt Warner 's finger is tender no more , Rams coach Mike Martz has no intention of keeping him on the sideline after Monday night 's visit from the Chicago Bears . <p> So even Bulger says forget about a comparison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brady leading the New England Patriots to last season 's Super Bowl title after Drew Bledsoe got hurt , got healthy , then could n't get back in the lineup . <p> " Look , with all due respect to Drew Bledsoe , Kurt has taken this team to two Super Bowls , " Bulger said in a telephone interview . " And I 'm supposed to be mad about him replacing me ? That 's just not the way things work on this team , and especially with this situation . " <p> Suppose , though , Bulger has yet another bang-up game ? And suppose the Rams , who fell to 0-5 in Jamie Martin 's only start before Martin injured a knee , reach .500 as Bulger triumphs on Monday Night Football ? <p> " God bless him , " Martz says . " He 's a good player , but the issue that keeps wanting to be made is not an issue . Kurt 's our quarterback . " <p> Bulger 's present equanimity about all of this may stem from his football career 's relatively modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father , Jim , was a backup quarterback at Notre Dame in the 1970s ; one younger sister , Katie , is a third-year starter for West Virginia 's women 's basketball team , and another , Meg , plans to play there next season . However , Marc did n't even play football until his sophomore year at Central Catholic High School in Pittsburgh , and he did so then only at the urging of his father and his older brother , Jimmy . <p> " So I go out there for my first game , in JV , and I break my collarbone . I 'm like , ' Thanks a lot , ' " says Bulger , who had been focusing on golf and basketball . <p> He gave it another try the next season , largely because a best friend was on the team , but he did n't start until his senior year , when he threw for a hardly eye-popping 1,662 yards . <p> " We were one of the few schools that even recruited him , but I had never seen such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Virginia coach Don Nehlen , who retired three years ago . " What he did for us , well , I coached football for 43 years , and I never had a kid with that quick of a release and who was that accurate with the football . " <p> Bulger left WVU as the school 's career leader in passing yards with 8,153 . Before his senior season , one truncated by injury , he received permission from Nehlen to switch his uniform number from 10 to 4 , the number his dad wore at Notre Dame . <p> " To say I was touched , " Jim Bulger says , " does n't say the half of it . " <p> NFL folks were not similarly touched by Marc 's college career . New Orleans drafted him in the sixth round ( 168th overall ) . <p> But he did n't stick there , did n't stick with Atlanta and signed with St. Louis before last season , which he spent as No. 3 quarterback . <p> And now this . <p> Jim Bulger never doubted his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But to have the highest quarterback rating after his fourth game ever is a little surprising , I will admit , " Jim Bulger says . " And it seems like he 's always on the TV and the radio . And then to walk into stores and see him on the front page of USA TODAY , not just sports but the front page of the whole pager , I mean , jeez ! " <p> Does n't hurt business , either , inasmuch that the elder Bulger works for a Pittsburgh-area financial company . " Talk about an ice-breaker , " he says . " You 're trying to get somebody to do business with you , and right off they want to talk about Marc . " <p> Fans divided , team united <p> It seems like everyone in St. Louis wants to talk about Marc these days . Respondents to radio call-in shows are more or less split about the wisdom of putting Bulger on the bench now that Warner is ready to return . <p> On one such show last week , wide receiver Ricky Proehl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back there can do the job . " <p> " This offense is built around trust , and both quarterbacks have it with their receivers , " he said . <p> Rams guard Tom Nutten dismisses those who talk of a QB controversy as " pot stirrers . " <p> Not that the players are ignoring the obvious , as fullback James Hodgins indicates . <p> " It 's a tough situation , " he says , " because we 've built up a lot of momentum with ( Bulger ) at quarterback . " <p> And what of Warner , who threw eight interceptions and just one touchdown pass before breaking his finger ? <p> He knows the speculation : that his arm strength and accuracy have n't been the same since an injury midway through last season , that the team might be better with Bulger . <p> " The guys in the organization and the coaches , they know what was going on and know the way I was playing , the way I was throwing the football  --  they know the facts there , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time somebody comes up with a theory that they can explain why I played like I did or why I threw a certain ball . <p> " Marc 's played tremendous , no question about it . But I feel I 've earned the right to call this my team . " <p> Trent Green might have said the same thing three years ago when he suffered a season-ending knee injury in preseason , giving Warner the starter 's job . Warner went on to win his first MVP award , lead the Rams to victory in the Super Bowl and secure the job for keeps . Green left for Kansas City after the next season . <p> Nehlen , who strongly hints he would stick with the guy with the hot hand if he were Martz , is n't surprised Bulger apparently will return to the bench without complaint . <p> " I never saw him do anything or say anything that ( went counter ) to a true team concept , " Nehlen says . " But the bottom line is winning . They were n't winning when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Bulger believes the success is a result of being able to play sponge last season . He learned the offense , studied the receivers , studied Warner and treated advice with reverence . <p> And do n't think Martz does n't know what he has or what he 's about to shelve . " Some of the strikes that he 's thrown downfield , there are n't many players in this league that could throw them , " Martz says . " He 's not just a starter , he 's an exceptional player in this league . " <p> And of course there 's a chance you might see Bulger again this season . <p> " But actually , I hope you do n't , " he says . " If you do n't see me again , that means we 're winning , and we want to win out and get back where we were last year . <p> " But I guess if something happened that I had to play , I 'll be ready . Let 's just hope that does n't happen .
