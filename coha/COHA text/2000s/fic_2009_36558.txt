Kevin glanced out the window of his childhood bedroom . The yard that sloped down toward the Chesapeake Bay was decorated with balloons . Piles of presents sat on a picnic table next to a cake decorated with toy trucks , Davy 's favorite things . All of the O'Briens had gathered to celebrate his son 's second birthday , but Kevin could barely summon the energy to get out of bed . Despite his resolve to be strong for Davy , he 'd pretty much been a wreck since Georgia 's death , not able to get a fix on anything , unable to make even the most basic decisions about his life . <p> He had made three decisions , though . He 'd quit his job as a paramedic , he 'd sold the town house , which was filled with memories of his too-brief marriage , and he 'd moved home . At least here , he knew there were plenty of people who would love and look out for his son while he figured out what came next . That was something he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Someone pounded on the door of his room  --  his younger brother from the sound of it . <p> " Get your butt downstairs ! " Connor bellowed . " The party 's about to start . " <p> Given his choice , Kevin would have crawled back into bed and pulled the pillow over his head to block out the sound of laughter coming from outside . He would n't , though . For one thing , even if nothing else in his life made sense , his son was the most important person in it . Kevin would n't let him down . For another , either Gram or his dad would be up here next , and either one of them had the power to shame him into doing what was right for the occasion . <p> " On my way , " he assured Connor . <p> He showered in record time , pulled on jeans and a T-shirt and slid his feet into an old pair of sneakers , then went downstairs . Only his youngest sister , Jess , was in the kitchen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're a mess , " she declared . <p> " I showered . These clothes are clean , " he protested . <p> " Did you lose your razor ? And maybe your comb ? " <p> " Who are you ? " he grumbled . " The fashion patrol ? " <p> " Just calling it like I see it , big brother . Everyone else spruced up for the party . Turning two is a big deal . " <p> " Do you honestly think Davy 's going to care if I shaved ? " he asked as he rubbed his hand over his unshaven jaw . He had shaved yesterday  --  or was it the day before ? He could n't recall . Mostly the days slipped by in a blur . <p> " No , Davy wo n't care today , but you 'll look like some derelict in the pictures . Is that the memory you want him to carry with him throughout his life ? Last year on his first birthday it made sense that you looked ragged . It was only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention her name , " he snapped . <p> " Someone has to , " she said , looking him directly in the eye without backing down . " You loved her , Kev . I get that . You 're hurting and angry because she 's gone , but you ca n't pretend she did n't exist . She was that little boy 's mom . What are you planning to do , let him go through his entire life with the subject of his mother off-limits ? What about his grandparents ? Do you expect them never to mention their daughter 's name ? " <p> " I ca n't talk about her . Not yet . " He knew it was irrational , but somehow he thought if he did n't talk about Georgia or her death , it would n't be real . She 'd still be out there , on the other side of the world , saving lives . She 'd still walk through the door one day , back into his life . <p> " When , then ? " Jess asked , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoyed , he might have admired her persistence . For a woman who rarely stuck with anything for long , Jess had certainly dug in her heels on this . Just his freaking luck . <p> " What do you expect me to say ? " he snapped again . " A day ? A month ? Hell if I know when I 'll be ready . " Even as he spoke , he felt the sting of tears in his eyes . He hated the sign of weakness almost as much as he hated this whole conversation . " Just drop it , okay ? " <p> Of course she did n't . " Sit down , " she ordered , not cutting him any slack . <p> He did n't like that Jess was turning the tables on him . His little sister had always come to him for advice . Now she was obviously planning to dole it out . Just like Georgia , once Jess got stirred up , she was going to speak her mind , whether anyone wanted to listen or not . Apparently this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he was too shaky not to and because she 'd plunked a cup of much-needed coffee on the table to go with whatever words she was intent on dishing out . <p> She pulled a chair close and sat so that her knees were brushing his . She covered one of his hands with hers . The show of sympathy was almost his undoing . <p> " Listen to me , Kev . You need to get out of this house . " <p> Alarm shot through him . " Why ? Has Gram said something ? Is having Davy underfoot too much for her ? Do she and Dad want me out of here ? " <p> She rolled her eyes . " You know better , " she said impatiently . " This is your home . I was n't saying you should move . I was saying you need to get a life . " Her gaze , locked with his , was filled with compassion . " I know this is going to sound harsh , but somebody needs to say it . Georgia died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real one , not the one who walks around here all day in a daze . " <p> He frowned at her . " I 'm not drinking , if that 's what you 're suggesting . " <p> " Nobody said you were . Look , I 'm saying all this now , before everyone else has a chance to gang up on you . You know it 's coming . You must . This family ca n't keep their opinions to themselves worth a damn . It 's amazing we 've all been so quiet for this long . " <p> He smiled , despite his sour mood . " You 're right about that . " <p> " Will you at least think about what I 've said ? If you promise to do that much , I 'll run interference and keep the others at bay a while longer . Abby , the mother hen , is champing at the bit to offer her own special brand of tough love . She 's worried sick that you have n't snapped out of this dark mood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep from being surrounded by all that well-meaning concern , especially from his oldest sister , he nodded . " There 's just one thing . " <p> " Oh ? " <p> " I do n't have any idea at all what to do with myself . " <p> " You 're a paramedic , " she reminded him at once . " There are openings right here in town . I 've checked . " <p> He shook his head . " No . I 'll never do that again . " His career was all twisted up in his mind with Georgia and how she 'd died on a call to a market in Baghdad after an explosive device had been triggered , killing and wounding a bunch of innocent civilians . She and her team had arrived just in time for the second bomb to be detonated . Kevin knew his reaction , his refusal to put his EMT training to good use , was n't rational , but then he was n't operating much on reason these days . <p> " You sure about that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Her expression brightened . " Then I have an even better idea . " <p> He did n't like the glint in her eyes one bit . Jess had always had a knack for getting into mischief . Ideas came fast and furiously with her . It was the follow-through that was lacking . Or had been , anyway , until she 'd opened The Inn at Eagle Point . That seemed to have captured her complete attention . After a shaky start , she had the place running smoothly and successfully . <p> " What 's your idea ? " he asked warily . <p> " A fishing charter , " she said at once , then rushed in before he could utter an immediate objection . " You could lease dock space at the Harbor Lights Marina . Come on , Kev , at least think about it . You spent half your life on the water as a kid . You always claimed it calmed you , even if you did n't come home with a single rockfish or croaker . And naturally , because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fish practically jumped into your boat . " <p> " You want me to become a waterman ? " he asked incredulously . It was a hard , demanding life , especially with the impact that farming and other human misdeeds were having on fish , crabs and oysters in the bay 's waters , to say nothing of what skyrocketing fuel costs had done to profit margins . <p> " Not exactly . I want you to take people out on your boat to fish . " <p> He gave her a wry look . " The only boat I currently own is barely big enough for me and one passenger , and I wind up rowing home more often than not because the motor 's unreliable . " <p> " Which is exactly why you 'll spend some of that trust fund money that 's sitting in the bank on a bigger , more reliable boat . Dad set up those funds for us to buy a home or start a business . I know you have n't touched yours , so the start-up money 's there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become an actual career ? " he asked skeptically . <p> " It 's not up there with saving lives , " she said pointedly . " But I get requests practically every day from guests at the inn who want to go fishing . There 's no one in town who does charters . Once in a while I can convince George Jenkins to take someone out , but he has the conversational skills of a clam . " <p> Kevin thought about the long , lazy days he and Connor had spent on the bay as boys . They were some of the best in his life . He had n't cared a fig about catching fish , just as Jess said , but he 'd loved the peace and quiet of being on the water . Of course , if he had a boat full of strangers along , the tranquillity would pretty much be shattered . Yet somehow the idea took hold . <p> Jess regarded him hopefully . " You 'll think about it ? " <p> There were a thousand practical things to be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take classes to become licensed to be a captain , for example , and that would get him out of the house . Maybe that alone would be enough to keep everyone off his case . <p> He nodded slowly . " I 'll think about it . " <p> " Good ! Now let 's go outside and spoil that son of yours rotten , " Jess said , dragging him to his feet . " You should see his haul of presents . They 're piled high . Davy does n't entirely understand yet that they 're his , so this should be fun . " <p> Fun was n't something Kevin had had in his life for a while now , but when he saw Davy running around on his chubby little legs , his mouth already streaked with chocolate frosting , he could n't help but feel a little lighter . And when Davy spotted his father and a smile spread across his face , Kevin felt a split second of pure joy . It was Georgia 's smile , as bright and carefree as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife had died , the sorrow lifted briefly and he felt hopeful again . <p> Despite his promise to Jess , Kevin spent two more weeks holed up at home , passing his days with Davy and his evenings hiding out in his room away from Gram 's pitying looks and his father 's increasing impatience . Mick clearly had plenty to say to him , Kevin could tell , but apparently an edict from Gram had kept his father silent . He doubted that would last much longer . <p> To his surprise , it was Gram herself who broke the silence first . She joined him on the porch at dusk one evening , handed him a glass of iced tea and a plate of his favorite oatmeal raisin cookies and said , " We need to talk . " <p> " About ? " Kevin asked , even more wary than he had been when Jess had made the same announcement . If Jess was good at uncomfortable , straight talk , it was because she 'd learned from a master  --  their grandmother . Nell O'Brien had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had divorced . She had a huge heart and a tart tongue . <p> " The way you 're moping around this house day in and day out , " she replied . " It 's not good for you , and it 's certainly not good for your boy . A child needs to expand his world , to see other children . " <p> Kevin frowned at that . " His cousins are here all the time . " <p> " Caitlyn and Carrie are almost eight now , and while they love playing with Davy , he needs to be with some youngsters his own age . " She gave him a penetrating look . " He needs to laugh , Kevin . When was the last time you got down on the ground and rough-housed with him , made him giggle ? " <p> " Seems to me that Dad 's filling that role . " In fact , Mick seemed to delight in it . <p> " It 's his father who ought to be doing it , not his grandfather . When was the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " You took him just yesterday , " Kevin reminded her . <p> Gram gave him an impatient look . " Is that what I asked ? I want to know when you took him . " <p> " I have n't , " he admitted . " But I do n't see why that 's such a big deal . Davy 's got plenty of attention around here . That 's why I moved back to Chesapeake Shores . " <p> " So we could raise him for you ? " she asked . The question was pointed , though her tone was gentle . <p> " No , of course not , " he retorted , then regretted his tone and sighed . " Maybe . " <p> " Kevin , we all know you 're grieving over Georgia , and there 's not a thing we would n't do to help out , but you have to start living again . You have to give Davy a more normal life . I know Jess has talked to you about this , so I waited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't go on watching you shortchange Davy or yourself like this . It 's just plain wrong . You 're a vital young man with a lot of years ahead of you . Do n't waste them and live to regret it . " <p> As much as he hated to admit it , Kevin knew she was right . He just had no idea precisely what he could do about it , not when he was filled with so many conflicting emotions . He was angry about a war that had taken a child 's mother and left him a single dad . He was guilt-ridden about not having tried harder to make Georgia reconsider taking another tour in Iraq , even after just about everyone in his family had begged him to . And he was grieving for a vibrant young woman who would never know her son , who would n't be there for his first day of school , his college graduation , his wedding . <p> He finally lifted his head and faced his grandmother . " Gram , I have no idea what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a triumph . " <p> She nodded knowingly . " That 's the way I felt when your grandfather died . I 'm sure it 's the way Mick felt when your mother left him alone with all of you children to raise . You know how he handled that . " <br> Continues ...
