On Wednesday night , the bandits moved from door to door , brandishing rifles and flashing knives . In the Kandahar suburb of Manan Medical , 15 men smashed their way into one mud-brick house after another . A local businessman named Shir Mohammed waited as they robbed his neighbors , holding blades to their throats . By 3 a.m. , the thieves were inside his house , tying up a guest and demanding cash . But Shir and his relatives fought back and , in a running gun battle that lasted until dawn , chased the robbers to their safe house , the local police headquarters . <P> In this city , where government salaries are not a reliable source of income , the rogue cops may have seen the raid as a tax collection . But the violence did not stop there , because this was a chance to settle a few scores . Kandahar is a polarized city ; the new governor , Gul Agha Sherzai , has the title but not all the power . Rival warlords see him as an ally of Pakistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to use his rivals ' troops to fill out his police and security units , but their loyalties lie with their commanders , not him . <P> And so the robbers  --  non-Kandahari Afghans recruited by Sherzai in Pakistan  --  were besieged at 7 a.m. by a gang of rival soldiers . Kalashnikovs barked back and forth , joined by salvos of rocket-propelled grenades . Lurking behind corners or popping out of windows , the fighters sprayed their rounds , oblivious to the market shoppers passing by . The skirmish was won by Sherzai 's rivals . Eventually , two men were whisked away . The crowd dispersed , and the soldiers relaxed . <P> Sherzai ca n't afford to do the same . Last time he was governor , in 1994 , lawlessness ruled the province . People were happy when the Taliban came to power and he fled to Pakistan . A burly warrior with a taste for gambling , Sherzai now needs to help the Americans hunt down fugitive Taliban and al-Qaeda forces but risks angering his citizens , many of whom still sympathize with those forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen by many as Muslim brothers needing protection . " If an Arab came to me for help , I would carry him to the border , no problem , " says a fruit merchant . In the city 's dusty back streets , thousands of graves are marked by small piles of stones . One cluster lies beneath a forest of green-and-white flags set atop 12-ft. wooden poles . This is the " Arab cemetery " for al-Qaeda 's dead , where hundreds pay their respects each day . <P> So far , U.S. forces have succeeded in rounding up more than 270 al-Qaeda and Taliban prisoners ; most are being held at the Marine base outside of town . New arrivals are questioned by FBI agents and military analysts . " We 're getting good stuff , " a military source says . " Oh , boy , are these guys talking . Most of them have simply had enough .
