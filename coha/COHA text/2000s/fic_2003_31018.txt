Chapter 1 : Profound Thoughts from the Monkey Bars Nothing appeared to happen on the day I began sixth grade at Pepperdine Elementary School that pointed to the extraordinary , and I have to add dangerous , events about to take place in my life . It 's as amazing that I 'm still here to record them as it was for me to be around to record two similar events that happened earlier . Some of you may choose not to believe what I 'm writing on these pages . But as a great and dedicated scientist , which I became in the summer following my year in the fourth grade , I feel I must make this report . I 'll be as accurate and truthful as I know how . The only noticeably different thing about the beginning of this first day of school from every other was the new sixth-grade cool-guy greetings my friends and I exchanged as I sauntered up to where they all sat hunched over on top of the monkey bars of the Pepperdine playground . " Hey , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Broomster that was me , Rupert P. Brown III , also known as Broomstick . " Hey , it 's the Peatmeister ! Hey , it 's the Creamer ! Hey , it 's the Bananapeeler ! Yay ! Yay ! Yay ! " I said right back , losing no time in joining them . Peatmeister , of course , was Peatmouse , otherwise Wayne Partlow . Creamer was Creampuff , otherwise Tommy Conrad . Bananapeeler was plain Banana , otherwise Harvey Robert Fanna . Now , once we 'd gotten all this cool-guy stuff over with , we 'd go back to being good old Peatmouse , Creampuff , Banana , and Broomstick , which we 'd called each other since about the third grade . I was just as long and skinny then as I am now , which is how I got my name . But who could have known back there in the third grade how prophetic that nickname would turn out to be ! " Where 's the Spookster ? " Peatmouse asked as soon as I 'd settled myself down beside them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I replied . " Her father got transferred . She 's about a thousand miles away from here now . " " That 's too bad , " said Creampuff . " Yeah , " I said , and let it go at that . I did n't see any point in going into how " too bad " it was . Spookster was Spook , otherwise Amelia Matilda Daley . I 'm the one who gave her the name Spook in the fifth grade because of the way she always breathed , " Boy , that 's spooky ! " when she looked into a microscope . As you may gather , Spook is a fellow scientist as well as a friend . She is the only one who knows the true details of the two earlier events I 've mentioned . In order for you to have a better understanding of the report I 'm about to make , I 'll reveal the most important of those details here . In the first of the two events , I was introduced to a real , honest-to-goodness , card-carrying witch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as our fifth-grade teacher , seeking the help of my great scientific brain to suggest some original witchcraft ideas that would satisfy the command of a goofy contraption called a computowitch . It belonged to a really nasty brand of witch named Saturna . Luckily , I came up with the idea of feeding it the information about what a great teacher Miss Switch was . The computowitch got so excited it practically blew itself up , and thus we got rid of Saturna . Or so I thought . But back she came , now determined to get rid of the one who had put her computowitch out of commission . That , of course , was me . Saturna tried to have me kidnapped , but it was Amelia who got kidnapped instead . Fortunately , Miss Switch came to the rescue . After some pretty scary events , all ended up well , and once again we got rid of Saturna . Or so I thought ! At any rate , I now return to the conversation I was having with my friends on the top rung of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , the first topic of conversation , as it always had been , was noteworthy events of that summer . My contribution was that I got another pet , a cockatiel , named Fred . I said " another " because he was in addition to my turtle , Caruso , and my two guinea pigs , Hector and Guinevere . Fred was a consolation prize from my parents because I did n't get to go to camp that summer . They had finally decided that camp was a waste of my time and their money , which I 'd been telling them all along . But if they wanted to console me with Fred , I was not going to argue . After all this we were ready for the burning question of who our teacher was going to be that year . " Maybe we 'll just get Mrs. Fitzgerald again , " Peatmouse said . " She 's okay , " Creampuff said . " We liked her most of the time . " " Yeah , " we all agreed . " You know what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " It 's not Mrs. Fitzgerald . It 's just that once you 've had the best , nothing else is ever going to seem that good . " It took them all zero seconds to know exactly the person I was talking about . " Miss Switch ! " Peatmouse said . " Yeah ! " said Banana and Creampuff . " And the thing is , " said Peatmouse , " that we could never really explain why we were so nutty about her . " " The whole class was , " said Creampuff . " But looking at her , you 'd think we were all just plain nutty . " I could n't argue with that one . I now refer you to some notes I made once regarding her looks : a . Sharp nose that could crack granite . b . Ridiculous little old-fashioned wire spectacles ( resting on said nose ) that instantly stop looking ridiculous when her eyes are drilling holes into some poor fifth-grade victim . c . Chin that could substitute for a pickax. d . Black hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be dislodged with a sledgehammer. e . Ancient , musty gray dress that could have been rescued from somebody 's old attic trunk . f . General appearance as cuddly as a steel knitting needle . " She was strict , too , " said Banana . " Boy , was she strict ! I mean , on a ' strict ' scale of one to ten , try fifteen . " " Then why did we like her so much ? " asked Peatmouse . " I mean besides her being the best teacher we 've ever had ? " We all looked at one another and said it at the same time : " Because she was so fair ! " And that was probably the biggest reason . She was n't just the best teacher , but the fairest we 'd ever had . When she had something unpleasant to say to you regarding your behavior in class , or your latest rotten English or arithmetic paper , and you watched her nose growing sharper , and felt her eyes turning your blood to ice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and then as her pickax chin chopped you to pieces , you always knew one thing : that you 'd earned it ! " On a ' fair ' scale of one to ten , you 'd have to pick a number so long , it fell off the blackboard , " said Banana . " Off the world , " said Creampuff . " Out of the universe , " said Peatmouse . " Yeah ! " I said . " Does anyone think she might be back ? " Banana asked . " Not a chance , " I said . " Why not , Broomstick ? " asked Creampuff . " That 's just my opinion , " I said . Anyway , how could I tell them exactly " why not " ? Spook was the only one I could discuss that with . After all , as I said , she was the only one who knew who Miss Switch really was , and that she would probably be back here only if trouble were brewing . As far as I could see , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly need Miss Switch 's special talents . Therefore , we could not expect her to appear in the sixth-grade classroom . But then how was I to know my opinion was wrong ? Dead wrong . For that very night when I sat down at my computer to e-mail Spook at spook@home.com , something sinister was already developing that was aimed right at me , Rupert P. Brown III . And not only at me , but also at Peatmouse , Banana , Creampuff , and the whole Pepperdine Elementary School sixth grade !
