You 're not alone if you 've stopped keeping track of the 9/11 investigation  --  the FBI 's largest ever , as we 've been told . But last week Washington insiders found a single thread in the giant investigation tapestry and began pulling  --  and in doing so created what could become a diplomatic mess with a key ally , just as the U.S. is trying to maintain support for its hard line on Iraq . <P> The hubbub began when congressional investigators leaked word that prominent Saudis  --  including Princess Haifa al-Faisal , wife of the Saudi ambassador to the U.S.  --  may have given money to associates of two 9/11 hijackers . The connection was tenuous but intriguing . Sources close to the case told TIME that beginning in January 1999 monthly payments of $2,000 were made from Princess Haifa 's checking account to Majida Dwaikat , wife of Osama Bassnan . A Saudi national , Bassnan was living in San Diego last year and has been linked to Omar al Bayoumi , a Saudi student who befriended two men who wound up helping crash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the ambassador , Prince Bandar bin Sultan , gave $15,000 to Bassnan . <P> Why ?
