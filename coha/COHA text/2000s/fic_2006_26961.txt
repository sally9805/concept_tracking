It was early morning . I walked , as I did each day at this time , along the small market street just around the corner from my apartment . As I went along , from butcher shop to bakery to greengrocer , I filled my string bag with the provisions I would need for the day . I had already bought a small bifteck , a bunch of carrots , a baguette , a pint of milk . It remained only to stop at the patisserie for a piece of my favorite almond cake , a dessert for my evening meal . I already knew the shopkeepers on the street . They greeted me warmly and called me by name even though I had only been living in the neighborhood for a few months . My small apartment did not have an ice box , and so I shopped each day along with the housewives of the quartier , which was the usual way at this time , even for those who possessed modern appliances . I enjoyed making my early morning rounds , choosing my provisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went along . I enjoyed the camaraderie with the merchants , the other shoppers , the same women each day . I looked forward to their friendly smiles , the tidbits of neighborhood gossip , the inquiries as to my health and well-being . It was as though I were a member of a small country community andnot just an anonymous resident in a big city . A newcomer , the local residents always made me feel as though I belonged . I had recently spent a year in New York at the main office of the news magazine for which I worked , and then I had returned to France and to my job at the Paris bureau of World magazine . I loved my new home , on the top floor of an old building at 18 , avenue de la Motte Picquet , on the Left Bank near Les Invalides . Motte Picquet was a fine , wide boulevard lined with chestnut trees and old buildings , many with grand facades featuring ornate stonework and fancy wrought-iron railings around their verandahs . At the corner was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where , soon enough , the waiters knew my name as I knew theirs . They always remembered what I had been willing to tell them about my life , and they loved to hear the latest goings-on at the famous news magazine where I worked . In the middle of the block was a small cinema that showed older French as well as foreign films , and , of course , just off the boulevard was the street lined with shops that I traversed each day . At the end of this street was a small neighborhood church , which I had never entered . The apartment itself was a quirky place , for it was an apartment within an apartment . My small rooms  --  a sitting room , a bedroom , a tiny kitchen and a bathroom  --  had been made out of one corner of a spacious flat that belonged to a famous singer , Monsieur Pierre Bernac . I entered by the main door into a large entrance hallway , then turned right toward the door leading to my sitting room . To the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been permitted to see was a spacious library with overstuffed furniture and a grand piano . It was here that the singer , retired now from performing himself , gave lessons to a select group of students who came from all over the world to study with him , so great was his reputation . It was in this wonderful room that the tall , imperious man had interviewed me , with great seriousness , great intensity , about my qualifications for living under his roof . I had to assure him that I intended to live alone , that I was a quiet person , that I did not give parties , and that I led a sober existence . My references from my convent school and university and employer probably reassured him as to my character and lifestyle , but there must have been residual doubts about a single young woman , for when he gave over the keys to his front door and to my own , he shook his head as though he thought he was making a serious mistake . Each time I passed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formally , but always with a dubious expression as though he suspected I had a man stashed behind my door with whom I was planning raucous parties . One of the pleasures of my new home was the wonderful music , splendid arias and lyrical songs , that wafted from the library just adjacent to my bedroom . The students were all male , with wonderful , rich voices , and it was as though private concerts had been included in my rent . I had been told by the wine merchant on the street where I shopped that Monsieur Bernac was  --  he whispered the words  --  a homosexual . Living within the confines of a homosexual 's private world was somehow exciting to me , as though I were part of a decadent way of life . I had to suppose that Monsieur Bernac 's students were not necessarily of their teacher 's sexual persuasion , but I could n't help looking at the young men coming and going and wondering which one might be the great man 's lover , or perhaps which ones , since I judged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . Of course , I had no knowledge on which to base such an assumption . I was grateful to be back in France after my year in New York . It was an interesting experience working there and I had learned a lot about my profession . But the hectic pace had worn me out and some of the people with whom I worked were harsh and foul-mouthed and disagreeable . Not everyone of course . I had met one nice man about my own age who wrote for the science and medical sections of the magazine , and he had made my time in New York more tolerable ... Continues ...
