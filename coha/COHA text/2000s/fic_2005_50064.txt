SO THERE I WAS AGAIN sitting in a restaurant with Pope Daniel the First ; this time one of the best sushi bars in Los Angeles . Also one of the most expensive . I 'd only been here once before - on someone else 's nickel , not mine . But this was Pope Dan 's invitation and his treat . So I could n't say no - besides , they 'd throw me out of the Science Fiction Writers of America if I turned down a free meal . It 's in the bylaws . <p> He used to be " That Pesky Dan Goodman , " then he discovered religion and established his own church , a chocolate schism of a joke that began on CompuServe and ended up a legitimate faith , with genuine adherents and very serious tenets . Do n't disturb The Bunny during his nap . <p> I sometimes wondered where Pesky 's money came from ; he never seemed to lack for anything , but he did n't drive either , did n't own a car , and made no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depended on the kindness of strangers . The stranger the better . He led a peripatetic life , so maybe the Pope business was more lucrative than I imagined . <p> He also had an unforgettable business card . " Pope Daniel the First , The Church of The Chocolate Bunny . " Below that , in smaller type , his specialties : " Philosophic Surrealism , Emergency Exorcisms , Day Old Bread . " <p> I once asked him how many emergency exorcisms he 'd performed in his career . " Only one , " he admitted , " but it was a nightmare . " He held up a hand to stop me from making further inquiries . " Sorry , I ca n't discuss it . All exorcisms are confidential . " Then he relented slightly . " The client had been possessed by a Hollywood lawyer gone malignant . " He shuddered . " A studio lawyer . " He shuddered again , this time even worse . " I wo n't say which studio , but it 's not hard to guess . Frankly , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... never mind ; I did n't invite you here to talk shop . " <p> " Why did you invite me ? " <p> " A couple reasons . " He twiddled his chopsticks and picked up a slice of pickled ginger . " Let 's start with the invitation . Do you remember what I asked you ? " <p> " Sure . " <p> " Say it . " <p> " You forgot ? " <p> " Humor me . " <p> " You asked me what I would do if I only had a few hours left to live . What would I choose as my last meal ? " <p> " Right . " <p> " So ? " <p> " So , did you ever stop to consider how fucking weird that is ? If you 're going to execute a guy , why are you feeding him first ? He 's not going to have time to digest it , is he ? So what 's the point ? " <p> I shrugged " I never gave it much thought . " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniel does . It 's always the springboard into another area of inquiry . I have to admit , he 's not my favorite person . Conversations with His Holiness leave me feeling as if someone has been doing root canal on my brain . <p> He was already pursuing the thought - with horses , a trumpeter , and a pack of bloodhounds . " The whole point of the last meal is that it 's a courtesy - we 're going to kill you , but we want you to have a bit of comfort food first . And you think I 'm surreal ? " <p> " So ... am I to take it from the terms of this dinner invitation that you 're planning to kill me ? " <p> " No . I do n't think so . Not tonight . " <p> The way he said it , I got the feeling that it was one of the options that had been considered and discarded , but His Holiness was n't the easiest man on the planet to read ; so I replied noncommittally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " To tell you the truth , that 's not my style . Actually , I have something else in mind . I want to pick your brain . " <p> " It 's the one in the middle . " <p> He ignored it . " You 're my time-travel expert . Hell , you 're everybody 's time-travel expert - " <p> " Not hardly . I only wrote the one book - " <p> " And thirty years later , it 's still in print . It 's a classic . Do n't pretend to be modest . Both you and I know the truth . " <p> " Right . I 'm an arrogant , self-righteous asshole . " <p> " Yes , but you 're our arrogant , self-righteous asshole - " <p> " Is that why we 're here ? You could have saved the time . I can get a free personality test on Hollywood Boulevard . All I need is a personality . " The Scientologists had thrown me out more than once ; a somewhat dubious honor , to be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It 's not your lack of personality I 'm interested in , " said His Holiness . " I have a question for you . An inquiry . A science fictional extrapolation , if you will . " <p> The first round of sushi arrived then . Yellowtail - with its delicate , seductive flavor , it 's one of my favorites . After the first bite , I turned back to him and asked , " Okay , what 's the question ? " <p> " If you had a time machine , who would you kill ? " <p> " You surprise me , Pesky . That 's an old and tired question - so old and so tired they do n't even have panel discussions on it at Worldcons anymore . " <p> " So ? Answer it anyway . " <p> " Well , the obvious ones are Hitler and Oswald and Manson , of course . Osama , if you could find him early enough . " <p> " Hitler and Oswald and bin Laden , I can understand . But why Manson ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That one 's for a selfish reason . " I admitted , " I knew one of the victims . Why do you think I wrote the damn book . It was a cry for help to the distant future : ' If someone downstream has a time machine , please come back and make it did n't happen . ' The fact that we 're sitting here tonight , well , that just proves to me that either time-travel is impossible , or nobody downstream cares enough about me to make the trip . " I added , " Actually , I 'd just as soon take out Watson , the guy who pulled the trigger , but it really does n't matter , does it ? The past is over . You ca n't undo it . The best you can do is learn to live with it . " <p> " So if you could change it , you would ? " <p> " Would I act like God ? Would I take on the responsibility ? Is that the point of the question ? " <p> Pope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just the starting point of the inquiry . Take the next step . Suppose you had a time machine . Suppose you had a gun with a silencer . Suppose you could find Hitler or Oswald or Manson or bin Laden before they did their worst . If you killed them , you 'd be killing an innocent man , would n't you ? " <p> " I 'm not the right person to answer that question . My family lost thirty-three members to the gas chambers at Auschwitz . My grandmother 's native village was leveled . That 's the personal investment . But I can argue it from the altruistic position too . World War II killed thirty million people , soldiers and civilians alike . If I could save thirty million people by killing one - " I shrugged . <p> " But you 'd still be a murderer . " He said it bluntly . <p> " Actually , a cold-blooded murderer , " I said . " Whatever my justifications , it still would n't excuse the act . Murder is n't altruistic . Especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preemptive revenge . Premeditated . So no , I would not get into heaven . If I believed in heaven , that is . " <p> " Right . You ca n't escape the karmic backslash . " <p> " Backlash , " I corrected , with machine-like automaticity . <p> " No , I said backslash , and I meant backslash . A quantum bit exists in two states simultaneously . OnOff . It 's a zen thing . Whenever you create a position , you automatically create its opposition - the opposite position . The duality is the larger whole . Except most of us get so stuck in one position that we ca n't own the opposite as well . " <p> " Um - you 're talking about the Tao . " <p> " I 'm talking about everything . When you assert that the gostak distims the doshes , " he continued , " you also create the assertion that the gostak does not distim the doshes . That 's how holy wars start . You ca n't be on without also being off . see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll write it out for you - " <p> " Never mind , I got it . So I 'm a murderer and a saint at the same time ? " <p> " No . You have the potential to be one or the other . You 're both until you actualize . Until Heisenberg tries to measure either your speed or your position . Then you 're whatever . " <p> " And there 's no free will ? " <p> " There 's always free will . That 's God 's gift to human beings . You get to choose which direction you want to go . Toward the light or away from it . It 's always your choice . " <p> I waited while the sushi chef set down the next course , tekka maki . Cold vinegared rice and raw fish , wrapped in dried seaweed . <p> " And all this has to do with time-travel , how ? " <p> " Well , suppose you did have a time machine . How could you prevent these men from becoming murderers without murdering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Take them out of their times and put them in loving foster homes , maybe .... " I thought about that . " But , no - that 's almost as bad . I might not be a murderer , but I 'd still be a kidnapper . And I 'd be bringing enormous grief to the parents and families . They do n't deserve that . " I stopped and looked at him . He was just pouring more hot sake into my cup for me . " Okay , I get your point . You 're looking for a karmically neutral solution , are n't you ? " <p> " Maybe , " he said . " I think I have one . But I want to hear what you can create first . " <p> " And then we 'll compare notes ? " <p> " Maybe . " He grinned . <p> " You know what ? You might be Pope , but you 're still Pesky . " <p> " Yeah ? And your point is ? " <p> I returned to the matter at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required slow , thoughtful savoring . " So , let 's try this , " I said . " Let 's postulate that you have to find the target - the person - as an adult , after he 's become an individual , acting on his own , independent and capable of free will . Right ? " <p> " So far , so good . " <p> " And in Hitler 's case you offer him an art scholarship somewhere in New York ; in Manson 's case a music contract with any small label . That kind of thing . Something to pull them off the negative track they 're on . " <p> Pesky nodded , considering it . " That 's an elegant solution , of course . Turn the negative energy into positive . " <p> " So , problem solved ? " <p> " No , not quite . Hitler was a lousy artist . And when Manson started to sing , trains would take dirt roads to get away . So where would you find a school to invest in Hitler , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , if you 're a time-traveler , you could - " <p> Pesky cut me off . " No . Even if you set up your own scholarship foundation , your solution requires what would very quickly turn into a prohibitive investment of time and money . Someone has to remain onsite to make sure the solution works . That means setting up a permanent monitoring team . No , what I 'm looking for is a one-time , non-destructive , karmically neutral termination of the threat . " <p> " All right , yeah . I see what you 're looking for . The one single action you can do in the past that will change the present . Got it . " <p> " Termination of the individual is n't an option . And let 's say I do n't have the resources to set up scholarships and recording contracts and other diversions . What else can I do ? " <p> " Well , how about extraction ? Send them to Coventry ? Some kind of exile ? " <p> " That 's still kidnapping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I frowned . " You 're making this harder than it needs to be , you know . " <p> " No , you are . " <p> " Eh ? " <p> " You 're the one who does n't want to be a murderer . I assume then , by extrapolation , that you do n't want to be a kidnapper either . Or anything else that compromises your integrity . " <p> " Yeah . You got it . Just because the other guy wants to wallow around in a moral gutter does n't mean that I have to get down there with him and wallow too . Remember that line from Gandhi ? ' In this cause , I too am prepared to die , but my friends , there is no cause for which I am prepared to kill/ Well , that 's me . I have to protect what 's left of my integrity ferociously , because I have so little . " <p> Pope Dan went thoughtful at that . As if I 'd said something wrong , something that disturbed his whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refilled it . " Let me try another tack , " he said . " Let 's go back to those guys you named . Hitler , Oswald , Manson , bin Laden . What do they all have in common ? " <p> " Um , well , for one thing - they 're fanatics . " <p> " And- ? " <p> " If a fanatic is willing to sacrifice his own life for a cause , then he 's just as willing to sacrifice your life too . " <p> " Ah . Yes . So , you 're saying that you 're not a fanatic ? " <p> " Well , I 'm fanatic about .... " I stopped , considered . " No . I 'm not a fanatic . Not about anything anymore . At least , I do n't think I am . I 'm not sure I 've ever been tested . No , wait . I 'm fanatic about the Constitution . The ideas it stands for . That the government of the people , by the people , and for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Nice line . " <p> " Thanks . " <p> " So you 're fanatic about the principles of freedom . " <p> " Yeah , I guess I am . The right to be unpopular . I 've had a lot of experience with that one . " <p> " Yes , that 's obvious . So .... " He twirled his wine cup thoughtfully . " Would you kill to protect the Constitution ? " <p> " Um - " Oops . <p> " Would you ? " <p> " Uh - " <p> " Would you ... ? " <p> " All right , all right . I see your point . So I 'm not Gandhi . " <p> " Nobody is . Even Gandhi was n't Gandhi . He just had better P.R . than you . The question , my dear , is n't whether you 're a fanatic . The question is how fanatic you are . " <p> " I do n't follow - " <p> " Gandhi was a fanatic . So was Dr. King . They were fanatics for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fanatics of any kind are dangerous . Even fanatics for peace . Jesus was a fanatic for peace ' and look how many wars have been waged in his name . Fanatics get in the way of rational people sitting down at the table and creating partnerships . How can you reach consensus if you have a fanatic in the room ? Any kind of fanatic . " <p> " I 'm sorry . You 're confusing me . Are you equating Hitler with Gandhi ? Jesus with Manson ? <p> " No . I 'm talking about that specific kind of single-minded , all-consuming , jackass-stubborn , ruthless determination toward a result that steamrollers over everything in its path - what we call ' evil ' except when we agree with it . Jesus and Gandhi had it . So did Hitler and Manson . The difference was the underlying intention . " <p> I put my chopsticks down . " I liked you better when you were only selling day-old bread . " <p> " Too much competition from Safeway . Besides , the Pope business pays better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He waved the thought away . " Let 's get back to Hitler . Or anyone else . Jesus , Manson , Gandhi , whoever . Let 's say you can meet him as an adult - but before he does any real damage . You have a gun in your pocket . You can kill him . But you do n't want to kill him - not for his sake , but for yours . You do n't want any man 's death on your conscience . It 's the John Donne thing . Do n't ask for whom the bell tolls . It tolls for thee . You have an hour , maybe less , maybe more . Do you think you could talk a madman or a fanatic out of his vision ? " <p> I cupped my hands , almost in a praying gesture , and breathed into them while I considered the question . The question . " You know as well as I do , every question determines its own answer . And the way you phrased that question ... well , no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's mad . He 's a fanatic . It 's in the definition of the word . So , no , I do n't think so . " <p> " All right , try it this way . Let 's say I 'm from the future . Let 's say you 're Hitler or Manson or some other whackadoodle . You have n't whacked the national doodle yet . Let 's say I take you out to dinner , just like this , and let 's say I engage you in a conversation , just like this , and let 's say , I ask you what you 're fanatic about - just like this . And let 's say you admit that you 're fanatic about getting the British out of India or civil rights for blacks or restoring the glory of the Fatherland or starting a race war or punishing the Great Satan or even protecting the Constitution of the United States of America ; it does n't matter , one 's as good as the other , but let 's say that I 'm a time-traveler and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you think I could talk you out of your vision ? Your commitment ? Your blind , stubborn belief that you know the answer better than anyone else ? " <p> " The way you just phrased it ? No . Why should I believe you ? What proof can you give me that you 're from the future ? What proof can you give me that I 'm going to have that kind of impact in the world ? And if you did show me convincing proof that I was responsible for a new religion or a holy war or some other colossal human disaster , I 'm not sure that would deter me . It might inspire me all the more . Wow , look how successful I 'm going to be ! " <p> " Right . That one is n't karmically neutral either , is it ? " He refilled my wine cup , then his . I got the feeling he was just warming up . " Okay , let 's try it another way . Let 's say I 'm still a time-traveler from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dinner . Let 's say I give you this thought experiment - not just because I want to exercise our mutual ability to take an idea and beat it to death , but because I have a choice . I can act willfully , or I can let you make the choice yourself . " <p> The wine in my cup had suddenly gone cold . I put it back down on the counter of the sushi bar . " Y'know , Pesky . I 'm really not comfortable where this conversation is headed . I really did like you better when you were only selling bread . Maybe we should call it a night - " I started to excuse myself . <p> He put his hand on my shoulder and pushed me back down onto my stool . With his other hand he pulled his coat back just a bit - just enough to reveal the gun in his under-the-shoulder holster . It was a very thin , very flat-looking weapon . And very dangerous-looking too . <p> I sat . <p> " Pesky ? " I leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point of information - which one of us is the madman here ? " <p> " Neither . I hope , " he said . " Just hear me out , okay ? " <p> " Okay . " <p> He signaled for another bottle of hot sake . I waved to the sushi chef . Spicy tuna hand roll . What the hell . I turned back to His Holiness , Pope Daniel the First of The Church of the Chocolate Bunny . Whatever other identities he had , they were still unknown to me . <p> " You say you love the Constitution of the United States of America . " <p> I nodded . <p> " You would kill to protect it ? " <p> I nodded again . " Yes . In certain circumstances . " <p> " Would you die to protect it ? " <p> I took a breath . " Yes . If I were certain that my death would ensure its survival . " <p> " You 're sure about that . " <p> " Yes . " <p> " What if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give up something you love ? " <p> " What ... ? " <p> He was looking into his wine cup , as if looking for courage ; he put it back down , then turned to face me directly . " What if I asked you to leave America , to never write another word of any kind - not even an e-mail . No articles , no stories , no books , no columns . Not even your blog . What if I told you that you could ensure the survival of your nation by giving up writing ? " <p> " Uh - " Not an easy question to consider . I turned it over a few times , held it up to the light and looked for the secret message . " I 'll admit it , writing is n't the easiest thing in the world - you sit alone in a room and talk to yourself . You listen to hear if you say anything worth repeating . You type up the good stuff . On paper the pauses do n't show . Then you make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's how you prove you 're not crazy . But it 's lonely work . I would n't mind giving it up . Except - " <p> " Except what ? " <p> " Except I 'm good at it . Maybe it 's the only thing I 'm good at . If I quit writing , how would I make a living ? " <p> " You could teach , you could counsel , you could be a trainer , you could do stand-up , you could even try panhandling - " <p> " No , " I said . " I 'm not sure I could give up writing . It 'd be a kind of soul-death . Ca n't we compromise ? What if I promised not to sell anything ? I 'd keep it all to myself , a private journal , like Emily Dickinson - " <p> " No , you could n't do that . Your ego would n't allow it . You love the audience attention too much . " <p> " You 're right about that . So what does that mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " No . Of course not . That 's not karmically neutral . Besides , I almost like you . " <p> " The feeling is almost mutual . So what 's the answer ? " <p> " You said it yourself , a little while ago . Extraction . The only question is whether or not the extraction is voluntary . How much do you love your country ? " <p> " There are days when my patience is tested . But that 's politics , not people . I lived in Ireland for a year , that was a long time ago , but it was a very bad time for me personally . I was alienated and bitter and cynical about everybody and everything - and for good reason . It was a rough time , not just for me but for everyone - the whole country . But I remember when I finally came back to the States , I looked down out of the window of the airplane and I saw the Statue of Liberty . I surprised myself . I got this hot feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could feel tears in my eyes . Because whatever else was going on , this was my home - " <p> " Would you give up your country to save it ? Would you ? " <p> " I do n't know . I suppose if I really believed you . But I 'd have to be convinced . I mean , really convinced . " <p> " So you want proof ? " <p> " I guess so , yes . " <p> " You 're clear that 's what you 're asking for ? Proof that you have the potential to destroy the thing you love the most ? " <p> " Yes . That 's what I 'm asking for . " <p> " All right . " He fumbled in his coat pocket <p> The island is actually kind of nice . The weather is hot and tropical , but we get cooling rains every afternoon about three or four . There are several settlements , that 's because some of the folks here do n't want to have anything to do with some of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a few . But none of us have any real contact with the outside world . We 're all in this together . We get books and movies and even some television , but no current events . It 's kind of like an extended vacation . <p> And I can write . All I want . <p> I just ca n't publish . <p> I 'm not happy about that , but you should be grateful . <p> Author Affiliation
