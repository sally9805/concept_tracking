<p> As a 23-year-old Morehouse College student in 1960 , Lonnie King Jr . marched the streets of Atlanta , joined sit-ins at local institutions like Rich 's and spent time behind bars as a leader in a movement that led to the peaceful end of Jim Crow laws at the city 's department stores , restaurants and lunch counters . <p> Seated in the " white only " City Hall cafeteria under a sign that read " The Public Is Welcome , " King was told by a cashier , " We do n't mean it . " King replied , " We 'll stay until you decide to serve us . " He and his fellow protesters were arrested  --  " politely , " King recalled  --  and spent the night in jail . <p> The response to challenging decades of Dixie tradition was n't always polite , said King , who is not related to the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. , the icon of the civil rights movement . Picketing a grocery in West End that same year , Lonnie King was punched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same spot , a segregationist threw acid in his face . The attacker never was arrested . <p> " If I had n't been wearing sunglasses that day , I 'd be blind now , " King said . <p> Now 70 years old and back in Atlanta after a 22-year absence , King is writing a book with a collaborator about the pivotal point in Atlanta 's history that he witnessed and played a role in . <p> " What we accomplished in 1960 could not have been done without others before us who paved the way , " said King . He and co-author Charles Black , another organizer in the student-led Atlanta protests , have not decided on a title for the book yet but expect to have the first-person history completed within a year . <p> " It 's going to be the definitive account of what happened , " King said . " There 's been a lot of revisionism told about that time by some people who have claimed to be part of the movement but were n't living here then . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Among those the book will feature are two now-deceased leaders in the city 's black community during segregation  --  John Calhoun , who co-founded the Atlanta Negro Voters League and in the 1970s was a city councilman , and Warren Cochrane , director of the Butler Street YMCA . King said Cochrane provided the " Y " as a place for the first black Atlanta police officers in 1948 to don their uniforms because the Police Department 's dressing rooms were segregated . <p> Their contributions to civil rights were crucial , though not well-known or remembered , King said , adding that he had disagreed with Cochrane over the Atlanta sit-ins . " He wanted us to go back to class , and let time and lawyers take care of the problem . There were a lot of people who felt like that ... " <p> King had great respect for Cochrane , in part because he rescued a young man who witnessed one of the worst race crimes in state history . Cochrane , who was light-skinned , spirited the black teenager from Walton County to Atlanta  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to one account  --  following the 1946 Moore 's Ford lynching of two African-American couples . <p> The teen , brutally beaten after he testified before a federal grand jury investigating the crime , worked as a janitor at the Butler YMCA and died several years ago , King said . <p> Calhoun , King said , resisted an order by a Fulton County Superior Court judge in 1956  --  a time of resistance to school integration  --  to turn over to state officials financial and membership records of the NAACP Atlanta branch he headed . He was jailed for contempt of court but released after chapter officials complied with the order . Calhoun , however , was fined $25,000 . <p> King continued his civil rights activities after college . A dozen years after his student protest days , he headed Atlanta 's NAACP branch and was the architect of a school system compromise that rejected large-scale busing in return for Atlanta getting its first black school superintendent , Alonzo Crim , and black members on the Board of Education . In the summer of 1973 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for opposing busing . <p> " I told the national NAACP leadership if my standing up to them would bring a black superintendent and blacks running the school system , then the loss of my unpaid position was a small price to pay , " King said last week , recalling his ouster . " We brought in Crim , and the system improved  --  there was improvement in test scores , more students going on to college . You get a better chance of educating black kids when you have someone running things who understands where they came from . " <p> King left Atlanta in the early 1980s for the U.S. Department of the Interior as an equal opportunity official in the management and building of dams in 17 western states , and he later managed a firm investigating equal opportunity complaints across the country . <p> Since 2002 , he has taught history and government in the Baltimore city high schools , and public administration and African-American history at colleges around Washington and Baltimore . <p> He returned to Atlanta early last year and lives in the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home building firm and caring for his ailing wife , Ora . <p> " Atlanta 's definitely a changed town , there 's been a lot of progress , and integration has been good for white and black alike , " he said . " Still , I notice the pockets of poverty and deprivation . <p> " Before they plant me , I want to focus on fixing the education problem for young African-American boys , to somehow solve the dropout rate and suspension rate . Too many kids seem lost before they even leave elementary school , " King said . <p> He said he still sees " too much residue " of the old segregated system . " But you ca n't put the blame on any one group . We need to get more people ... willing to help themselves , and I do n't see enough of that , " King said . <p> Then , he recalls the challenge of his college days .
