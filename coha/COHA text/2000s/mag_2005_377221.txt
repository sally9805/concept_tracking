In 2002 , West Nile hit Chicago hard . At the end of the year , after 22 had died from the virus , the city 's public-health officials looked back and asked what could have been done differently . An answer came from an unlikely source : data collected from 311 , a hotline for residents to request city services . Nearly 4,000 calls had been placed that summer and early fall to ask the sanitation department to pick up dead crows . The public-health team , knowing that dead birds often mean West Nile is afoot , overlaid maps of 311 calls and human cases of the virus . Their hunch was right : calls to 311 predicted where West Nile was about to hit . So now , each summer , Chicago officials closely watch 311 calls about dead birds and strategically send work crews with larvicide to kill mosquitoes before they hatch and start transmitting the virus . Chicago has n't had a major outbreak since . <P> When the first 311 service was launched in Baltimore , Md. , in 1996 , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 911 , which had been clogged with nonemergency calls about stumbling drunks and yapping dogs . But as 311 spread across the U.S. , it evolved twice . First , it became a means for cities to improve customer service by cataloging complaints and tracking response time  --  and a much easier option for residents than navigating individual city agencies . And now a few cities like Chicago , Dallas and Chattanooga , Tenn. , are not only answering 311 calls but also analyzing the larger patterns that emerge from them . In those places , 311 has become a direct line into the urban consciousness  --  a way of harnessing the collective needs of an entire population to make a city work better . That is urban reform at its most elegant . <P> In Baltimore , which gets 60,000 calls to 311 each month , the innovation has helped crack systemic problems ranging from potholes to graffiti to snow removal to floodwater . When 2003 's Hurricane Isabel hit and calls about submerged streets cascaded into the downtown Baltimore call center , the water department mapped the calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city 's storm-water system . Department officials determined which storm drains were clogged and sent crews to clear them . " 311 is genius in its simplicity , " says Ted O'Keefe , director of Chicago 's 311 City Services Center . <P> New York City residents make about 41,000 calls to 311 every day . The largest complaint ? Noise . That may not seem surprising for big-city life , but what 311 revealed was that the biggest racket came from construction sites and barking dogs  --  not bars and restaurants , as neighborhood groups had always led the city to believe . " 311 democratizes the system , " says Charles Sturcken of the city 's department of environmental protection , which monitors 18 categories of noise . One result is a new noise-control bill making its way through the city council that would rework regulations on everything from car alarms to ice cream trucks  --  and require that construction sites have noise-reduction plans . Some of those noise complaints also shed light on an old problem : unlicensed , makeshift bars . But which calls were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors ? New York City 's 311 staff , working with half a dozen agencies , used maps to connect data about different sorts of calls  --  noise , public drunkenness , double parking  --  to find the clubs and bust them .
