Photograph // Golfers line up across a practicle tee at a course in western Florids , Ping , ping , ping , ping , ping Their metal clubs smack solidly into the golf balls , sending them high end fir ar over the tush , green grass . Chan Song Wongluckiest 17 , takes his place midway down the line of a dozen or so golfers , Nearby are his twin 14-year-old sister , Naree and Aree . You 'll find these three at a practice tee or on the golf course almost every afternoon . Swin , Ping , The ball rockets high , far and straight , Again and again and again . Hundreds of times . Every day . " If you want to be serious about fole , you got to love the game , " Chan says . And Chan Song Wongluekiet ( wahn-gloo-KEE-it ) is serious about golf . Practice Makes Perfect After his father introduced him to folf at age 8 , Chan says he " whiffed , hit shanks , everything " for several months . But by the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time and won a couple of national junior tournments in his native Thailand , a country in southeast Asia . That 's when he got serious about the game . " I ask him , You want to be a PGA Tour pro ? ' " says his father , InTong Song . " He said yes . I said , It 's not easy You must practice . " ' Since then , Chan has practiced golf almost every day Reaching his goal of competing on the Professional Golf Association ( PGA ) Tour , however , meant coming to the United States . He left his parents and sisters behind when he was 13 to attend the David Leadbetter Golf Academy in Bradenton , Fla . " My dad said the place to play sports and pursue your education is the United States , " he says . " You ca n't do both in Thailand . The first month , I was kind of lonely But we 're all here for the same reason : We want to improve our game . " Improve he did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation in both the Golf Digest and the Golfweek/Titleist junior boys ' rankings after winning three national tournaments in 1999 . He also won the City of Bradenton Men 's Amateur Championship , beat ing all of the area 's top adult golfers , including former pro Randy Torgerson . " He 's extremely talented , " says Torgerson , whose Bradenton championship scoring record Chan broke last year . " There are a lot of great players , and such a thin line between making it as a pro and not making it . But I think he has it . " Family Plan Naree and Aree have it too . The girls took the U.S. junior golf circuit by storm last year when they turned 13 and became old enough to compete with 17- and 18-year-olds , combining to win eight of the 11 tournaments they entered . Like Chan , they usually score in the upper 60 's or low 70 's , tremendous scores for golfers of any age . Before turning 14 , Aree was No. 1 in the junior girls rankings ; Naree was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best pros in the game at the LPGA Nabisco Championship ( see box ) .

" I think they can do for the women 's tour what Tiger Woods did for the PGA Tour . " Woods brought the men 's tour to life with his multiple victories while barely in his 20 's . The twins eventually followed Chan to the Leadbetter Academy , then their parents moved from Thailand as well . The family now lives on the academy 's grounds in Bradenton , and all five frequently travel together to tournaments . Their father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , Vanee Wongluekiet-Thai children customarily take their mother 's family name-never took up the sport . They sold the family 's hotel in Thailand to pay living expenses and the children 's tuition . " It 's a massive financial sacrifice for them , " says Jonathan Yarwood , who coaches all three teenagers . " They sold everything they had . Not many people would take that kind of financial risk on anything , but if I had a family like Chan and the girls , I definitely would . They 're a very special family " Targeting the Future The risk could pay huge rewards in a few years if the Wongluekiets become golf professionals . ( Tiger Woods , for example , made nearly $3.5 million just in his first eight tournaments this year . ) Still , the family is n't counting on anything . Chan plans to attend college and , although he wants to become a pro , his focus is working on his game day by day , swing by swing . " I have a goal for every day , then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . It 's like a staircase-you have to walk up . You ca n't just jump up 15 levels . " Says Mr. Yarwood : " Chan has great desire . I 've never seen him give up . That 's his greatest quality . He 's got the heart of a lion . " And perhaps some day , the game of a Tiger . Photograph Even on the driving range Chan uses a mirror to check his form before swinging . Photograph LIFE AT THE ACADEMY Sidebar HERE COME THE TWINS Astralia 's Karrie Webb is one of the hottest golfers in the world . But even as she scores victory after victory on the Ladies Professional Golf Tour , she knows all good things eventually end . This time , the end has a face . Two , actually : Aree and Naree Wongluekiet . In March , Aree and Naree competed in the Nabisco Championship , one of the biggest events on the LPGA Tour . Though too young to compete as professionals and earn money , the 13-year-olds were invited to play . Naree finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( pictured at right ) shocked the pros by placing 10th . ( In pro golf , success is measured as much in top-10 finishes as it is in victories . ) " She 's an amazing talent , " Webb says of Aree . " The other players on the Tour are lucky that the twins ca n't be out here for another five years so we can make some money before both of them are out here . " When Aree and Naree get there , they no doubt will have Chan 's support . He takes his role as older brother seriously . He even took care of the twins when they played in a tournament in South Korea while their parents remained in Florida . " He looks after us , " Naree says . " He makes sure we think before we say . " For now , all three teenagers are content to let the pros battle it out for the big bucks . " I like to go fishing and ride my bike with my sister , " Aree says . " You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stuff like that . We try to have a balanced life . " // <p>
