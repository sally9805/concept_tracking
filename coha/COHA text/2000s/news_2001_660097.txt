<p> It was a job offer Dan Berger did n't want to refuse - the chance to head a fast-growing Web company near Boston . At the same time , he was reluctant to uproot his two sons , ages 10 and 12 , from the family 's home near San Francisco and from their schools , sports teams , and friends . After weighing their options , the family devised a thoroughly modern solution : Mr. Berger would become a cross-country commuter , working three weeks in Massachusetts , then return to California for 10 days . " It 's just difficult with a family to up and relocate , " explains Berger , the CEO of SalesDriver in Maynard , Mass . " It 's a real trade-off between accepting a fantastic job opportunity and uprooting the children . " In an age of frequent job mobility , decisions like this are becoming more common . Most families still relocate , of course . Yet for modern pioneers like the Bergers , the moving van does n't come - at least not yet . One parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of miles away , while the spouse and children stay put , forging a brave new work arrangement - the commuter family . <p> No current statistics track these families . But anecdotal evidence suggests that their ranks , while still tiny , are growing . Nearly 40 percent of corporate relocation executives find that at least some employees in their companies have said no to relocation , according to an Atlas Van Lines survey . Nearly 90 percent give family ties as a reason . Three-quarters cite personal reasons , while two-thirds mention a spouse 's employment . Some families also keep their homes as an anchor in case a new job or a start-up company does not last . Tethered to e-mail , cellphones , Webcams , two-way paging systems , electronic greeting cards , and even digital photos , family members find inventive ways to stay in touch . Yet no one pretends the logistics are easy . As long-distance commuters spend hours in the air , eat dinners alone , and settle for high-tech connections with children and spouses , many face unsettling questions about the effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been working pretty well , " Berger says after 10 months . Still , he acknowledges " an element of guilt , " and says , " You have to look at the opportunity you 're taking and ask , ' Is this really good for the whole family ? ' We think this opportunity is a good thing for us overall . It 's not just my personal success . " <p> Make sure everyone agrees Chris Essex , co-director of the Center for Work and Family in Rockville , Md. , emphasizes the importance of a " buy-in , " an agreement by both parents that this is the way the family will live . She speaks from experience . Five years ago her husband , a civil engineer , was offered a " project of a lifetime " in New Zealand . After thinking " long and hard " and talking with their son , then 9 years old , Ms. Essex agreed to the arrangement . The couple expected it to last nine months at most . " I bought in for nine months , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even though her husband came home for a week every month , and Essex and their son traveled to New Zealand twice to see him , the separation proved difficult . " We definitely noticed that my coping ended at the nine-month point , when my buy-in ended , " she says . Even so , Essex and her family found a silver lining . The experience helped them figure out " how we were going to choose to live our lives and what our priorities are . " She and others agree that it takes a special job to justify the sacrifices . Terrie O'Hanlon , who commutes weekly from Columbus , Ohio , to Atlanta , calls her position as senior vice president of marketing for CheckFree " a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity . " She has been making the weekly trek for 2-1/2 years . " It 's not for everybody , but it sounds harder than it is once you get in the groove of it , " she says . Every Sunday evening , Ms. O'Hanlon kisses her husband and three children , ages 11 , 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where she maintains an apartment . She returns to Columbus on Thursdays . During her absence , a live-in nanny gets the children off to school and is there when they return . O'Hanlon arranges to be home for family birthdays but misses school activities such as " Donuts With Moms . " Her nanny accompanies the children to those events . <p> Spending time with the kids O'Hanlon devotes Friday evening to the children , saying , " Whatever else is going on in their life , they know Mom is going to do something fun with them . " Every Saturday night she and her husband , Peter , also plan a " date . " Sometimes they include the children for a sports event or movie . O'Hanlon emphasizes that she and her husband also talk with the children about the reasons behind these decisions , " rather than just have them wonder why Mommy goes to Atlanta every week . " But even the best reasons ca n't assuage the loneliness that sometimes besets family members at both ends . One Midwestern wife in a commuter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't want people to know I 'm here alone , " remains in Indiana with their two children while her husband spends the workweek at his public relations firm in Washington , D.C. The family stays in Indiana , she says , " because of the kids . " Even so , the children , ages 10 and 13 , " miss their father a great deal . Right now it 's Cub Scout pinewood derby time . That 's a dad project . He does it on weekends , but it 's still hard on them . " She also finds the separation harder on her husband than it is on her . " He comes home at the end of the day to an empty apartment . He knows he is missing some milestones with the kids . " To help him stay connected , she takes a cellphone to school concerts that involve her children . She holds the phone up so he can hear , and says with a laugh , " It 's a given that Dad 's on the other end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We discuss it , " the woman says , " and I can see at some point in the near future that we would move out East . " When Michael Strait , of Rockville , Md. , began looking for a new job last year , he and his wife , Johanna Potts , had several friends whose spouses were commuting . As Ms. Potts recalls , " I very generously said , ' Oh , do n't limit yourself to the Washington area . We can work it out . ' I was thinking New York . " Instead , Mr. Strait found a job 3,000 miles away , as director of assessment and testing for California State University in Hayward . He comes home every three or four weeks to spend the weekend with Potts and their two teenage sons . " The most difficult thing is the time-zone difference , " she says . " It 's never the right time . When he 's at the end of the day , ready to relax and talk to us , we 're ready to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - it 's asynchronous . " She and others emphasize the value of community support . " My son has wonderful friends . That 's been really helpful to him , to have that support and connection . " Her own friends also pitch in when necessary . The couple plans to reevaluate their situation when their younger son graduates from high school in two years . In the meantime , they find compensations . Potts and her sons spent the winter school break in California , visiting Strait . Even the most dedicated commuters find that constant travel can be wearing . Says Berger , " Sometimes I look at that flight and think , ' Oh my gosh , I 've got to do this again . ' " One recent cross-country trip took 15 hours because a connecting flight was cancelled . For the Bergers , as for other commuter families , cherishing small moments becomes essential . " You really end up treasuring the time you spend together , " Berger says . " Even if it 's just walking our dogs around the park , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually spend it together . " During separations , his sons call his cellphone " the Dad hotline , " because they can reach him anytime . But even technology ca n't meet every need . Berger recalls one " fairly intense family issue " that tested the limits of bicoastal parenting . To his great disappointment , his older son , an avid skateboarder , did not want to continue in Little League . " There was definitely some campaigning going on with Mom , seeing what he could get away with , " Berger says . During his next trip home , Berger explained the value of team sports . His son agreed to continue playing this year . One veteran road warrior , Omar Leeman , has been commuting from his home in suburban Houston for 10 years . Whenever he had a chance to relocate , his family voted to stay put . " My kids would say , ' Dad , just enjoy your airplane rides . ' " Mr. Leeman , now CEO of Talk2 Technology in Salt Lake City , asks his four children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives me a chance to stay in touch with them . It also helps them to learn how to put their thoughts in writing . " He saves all their e-mail , which he likens to a journal . Since last October , when Ray Kingman began a new job as CEO of TopicalNet in Woburn , Mass. , he has commuted weekly from suburban Washington so his 13-year-old son , Matthew , could finish the school year . The family will move next summer . Mr. Kingman sees one benefit : " Matt 's gotten a lot closer to his mother , " he says . " And he 's taken it on himself to do his part . " While his mother and mother-in-law are " entirely supportive " of the temporary arrangement , kingman notes that they are " very guarded about making sure that it does n't go on longer than necessary . " He adds , " I subscribe to this - making sure that the family is reconnected on a weekly basis , and that the commute thing does n't go on indefinitely . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this advice : " When you are together , make sure you spend time together . When you 're back on the work side , you 'll find that you have great memories that can help to offset the disadvantages of separation . " <p> Long-distance commuting tips Chris Essex , co-director of the Center for Work and Family in Rockville , Md. , offers these suggestions for families considering a long-distance commuting arrangement : Be sure you have a well-thought-out plan that considers the needs of every family member . Both partners need to " buy in " to the idea . Try to include children in the process . Tell them , " This is what we 're thinking of doing . We 'd like to know what you think about it , and what questions you have . " After the commuting begins , monitor children carefully . Do n't kid yourself if things are not going well for them . These arrangements do not fit the needs of some children . When the commuting parent comes home , be sure he or she is home mentally as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Reevaluate the pluses and minuses regularly . Drawing on her own experience and that of other commuter families , Ms. Essex says , " I ca n't say that it 's recommended . I really think it should be a last resort . My preference would be for families to move together . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2001 . The Christian Science Monitor
