Chapter One They were in the Smoky Mountains at their favorite bed-and-breakfast . David was smiling down at her . " What do you say , gorgeous ? Marry me ? " Looking up from their canopy bed , she knew he was the one . Forever . As she stared into his deep-green eyes , somewhere in the distance a deafening bell began to ring . It was pulling him away . She reached for him , but her arms clutched empty air . It was the sound of the phone that fully awoke Susan Fletcher from her dream . She gasped , sat up in bed , and fumbled for the receiver . " Hello ? " " Susan , it 's David . Did I wake you ? " She smiled , rolling over in bed . " I was just dreaming of you . Come over and play . " He laughed . " It 's still dark out . " " Mmm " She moaned sensuously . " Then definitely come over and play . We can sleep in before we head north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why I 'm calling . It 's about our trip . I 've got to postpone . " Susan was suddenly wide awake . " What ! " " I 'm sorry . I 've got to leave town . I 'll be back by tomorrow . We can head up first thing in the morning . We 'll still have two days . " " But I made reservations , " Susan said , hurt . " I got our old room at Stone Manor . " " I know , but- " " Tonight was supposed to be special-to celebrate six months . You do remember we 're engaged , do n't you ? " " Susan " He sighed . " I really ca n't go into it now , they 've got a car waiting . I 'll call you from the plane and explain everything . " " Plane ? " she repeated . " What 's going on ? Why would the university ... ? " " It 's not the university . I 'll phone and explain later . I 've really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be in touch . I promise . " " David ! " she cried . " What's- " But it was too late . David had hung up . Susan Fletcher lay awake for hours waiting for him to call back . The phone never rang . Later that afternoon Susan sat dejected in the tub . She submerged herself in the soapy water and tried to forget Stone Manor and the Smoky Mountains . Where could he be ? she wondered . Why has n't he called ? Gradually the water around her went from hot to lukewarm and finally to cold . She was about to get out when her cordless phone buzzed to life . Susan bolted upright , sloshing water on the floor as she grappled for the receiver she 'd left on the sink . " David ? " " It 's Strathmore , " the voice replied . Susan slumped . " Oh " She was unable to hide her disappointment . " Good afternoon , Commander . " " Hoping for a younger man ? " The voice chuckled . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not how it- " " Sure it is " He laughed . " David Becker 's a good man . Do n't ever lose him . " " Thank you , sir . " The commander 's voice turned suddenly stern . " Susan , I 'm calling because I need you in here . Pronto . " She tried to focus . " It 's Saturday , sir . We do n't usually- " " I know " he said calmly . " It 's an emergency . " Susan sat up . Emergency ? She had never heard the word cross Commander Strathmore 's lips . An emergency ? In Crypto ? She could n't imagine . " Y-yes , sir . " She paused . " I 'll be there as soon as I can . " " Make it sooner . " Strathmore hung up . Susan Fletcher stood wrapped in a towel and dripped on the neatly folded clothes she 'd set out the night before-hiking shorts , a sweater for the cool mountain evenings , and the new lingerie she 'd bought for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a clean blouse and skirt . An emergency ? In Crypto ? As she went downstairs , Susan wondered how the day could get much worse . She was about to find out . Chapter Two Thirty thousand feet above a dead-calm ocean , David Becker stared miserably from the Learjet 60 's small , oval window . He 'd been told the phone on board was out of order , and he 'd never had a chance to call Susan . " What am I doing here ? " he grumbled to himself . But the answer was simple-there were men to whom you just did n't say no . " Mr. Becker , " the loudspeaker crackled . " We 'll be arriving in half an hour . " Becker nodded gloomily to the invisible voice . Wonderful . He pulled the shade and tried to sleep . But he could only think of her . Chapter Three Susan 's Volvo sedan rolled to a stop in the shadow of the ten-foot-high , barbed Cyclone fence . A young guard placed his hand on the roof . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual half-minute wait . The officer ran her card through a computerized scanner . Finally he looked up . " Thank you , Ms. Fletcher . " He gave an imperceptible sign , and the gate swung open . Half a mile ahead Susan repeated the entire procedure at an equally imposing electrified fence . Come on , guys ... I 've only been through here a million times . As she approached the final checkpoint , a stocky sentry with two attack dogs and a machine gun glanced down at her license plate and waved her through . She followed Canine Road for another 250 yards and pulled into Employee Lot C. Unbelievable , she thought . Twenty-six thousand employees and a twelve-billion-dollar budget ; you 'd think they could make it through the weekend without me . Susan gunned the car into her reserved spot and killed the engine . After crossing the landscaped terrace and entering the main building , she cleared two more internal checkpoints and finally arrived at the windowless tunnel that led to the new wing . A voice-scan booth blocked her entry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ONLY The armed guard looked up . " Afternoon , Ms. Fletcher . " Susan smiled tiredly . " Hi , John . " " Did n't expect you today . " " Yeah , me neither . " She leaned toward the parabolic microphone . " Susan Fletcher , " she stated clearly . The computer instantly confirmed the frequency concentrations in her voice , and the gate clicked open . She stepped through . The guard admired Susan as she began her walk down the cement causeway . He noticed that her strong hazel eyes seemed distant today , but her cheeks had a flushed freshness , and her shoulder-length , auburn hair looked newly blown dry . Trailing her was the faint scent of Johnson 's Baby Powder . His eyes fell the length of her slender torso-to her white blouse with the bra barely visible beneath , to her knee-length khaki skirt , and finally to her legs ... Susan Fletcher 's legs . Hard to imagine they support a 170 IQ , he mused to himself . He stared after her a long time . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As Susan reached the end of the tunnel , a circular , vaultlike door blocked her way . The enormous letters read : CRYPTO . Sighing , she placed her hand inside the recessed cipher box and entered her five-digit PIN . Seconds later the twelve-ton slab of steel began to revolve . She tried to focus , but her thoughts reeled back to him . David Becker . The only man she 'd ever loved . The youngest full professor at Georgetown University and a brilliant foreign-language specialist , he was practically a celebrity in the world of academia . Born with an eidetic memory and a love of languages , he 'd mastered six Asian dialects as well as Spanish , French , and Italian . His university lectures on etymology and linguistics were standing-room-only , and he invariably stayed late to answer a barrage of questions . He spoke with authority and enthusiasm , apparently oblivious to the adoring gazes of his star-struck coeds . Becker was dark-a rugged , youthful thirty-five with sharp green eyes and a wit to match . His strong jaw and taut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall , Becker moved across a squash court faster than any of his colleagues could comprehend . After soundly beating his opponent , he would cool off by dousing his head in a drinking fountain and soaking his tuft of thick , black hair . Then , still dripping , he 'd treat his opponent to a fruit shake and a bagel . As with all young professors , David 's university salary was modest . From time to time , when he needed to renew his squash club membership or restring his old Dunlop with gut , he earned extra money by doing translating work for government agencies in and around Washington . It was on one of those jobs that he 'd met Susan . It was a crisp morning during fall break when Becker returned from a morning jog to his three-room faculty apartment to find his answering machine blinking . He downed a quart of orange juice as he listened to the playback . The message was like many he received-a government agency requesting his translating services for a few hours later that morning . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization . " They 're called the National Security Agency , " Becker said , calling a few of his colleagues for background . The reply was always the same . " You mean the National Security Council ? " Becker checked the message . " No . They said Agency . The NSA . " " Never heard of ' em " Becker checked the GAO Directory , and it showed no listing either . Puzzled , Becker called one of his old squash buddies , an ex-political analyst turned research clerk at the Library of Congress . David was shocked by his friend 's explanation . Apparently , not only did the NSA exist , but it was considered one of the most influential government organizations in the world . It had been gathering global electronic intelligence data and protecting U.S. classified information for over half a century . Only 3 percent of Americans were even aware it existed . " NSA " his buddy joked , " stands for ' No Such Agency . ' " With a mixture of apprehension and curiosity , Becker accepted the mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their eighty-six-acre headquarters hidden discreetly in the wooded hills of Fort Meade , Maryland . After passing through endless security checks and being issued a six-hour , holographic guest pass , he was escorted to a plush research facility where he was told he would spend the afternoon providing " blind support " to the Cryptography Division-an elite group of mathematical brainiacs known as the code-breakers . For the first hour , the cryptographers seemed unaware Becker was even there . They hovered around an enormous table and spoke a language Becker had never heard . They spoke of stream ciphers , self-decimated generators , knapsack variants , zero knowledge protocols , unicity points . Becker observed , lost . They scrawled symbols on graph paper , pored over computer printouts , and continuously referred to the jumble of text on the overhead projector . Eventually one of them explained what Becker had already surmised . The scrambled text was a code-a " cipher-text " - groups of numbers and letters representing encrypted words . The cryptographers ' job was to study the code and extract from it the original message , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they suspected the original message was written in Mandarin Chinese ; he was to translate the symbols as the cryptographers decrypted them . For two hours , Becker interpreted an endless stream of Mandarin symbols . But each time he gave them a translation , the cryptographers shook their heads in despair . Apparently the code was not making sense . Eager to help , Becker pointed out that all the characters they 'd shown him had a common trait-they were also part of the Kanji language . Instantly the bustle in the room fell silent . The man in charge , a lanky chain-smoker named Morante , turned to Becker in disbelief . " You mean these symbols have multiple meanings ? " Becker nodded . He explained that Kanji was a Japanese writing system based on modified Chinese characters . He 'd been giving Mandarin translations because that 's what they 'd asked for . " Jesus Christ . " Morante coughed . " Let 's try the Kanji . " Like magic , everything fell into place . The cryptographers were duly impressed , but nonetheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequence . " It 's for your own safety " Morante said . " This way , you wo n't know what you 're translating . " Becker laughed . Then he noticed nobody else was laughing . When the code finally broke , Becker had no idea what dark secrets he 'd helped reveal , but one thing was for certain-the NSA took code-breaking seriously ; the check in Becker 's pocket was more than an entire month 's university salary . On his way back out through the series of security checkpoints in the main corridor , Becker 's exit was blocked by a guard hanging up a phone . " Mr. Becker , wait here , please . " " What 's the problem ? " Becker had not expected the meeting to take so long , and he was running late for his standing Saturday afternoon squash match . The guard shrugged . " Head of Crypto wants a word . She 's on her way out now . " " She ? " Becker laughed . He had yet to see a female inside the NSA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman 's voice asked from behind him . Becker turned and immediately felt himself flush . He eyed the ID card on the woman 's blouse . The head of the NSA 's Cryptography Division was not only a woman , but an attractive woman at that . " No " Becker fumbled . " I just ... " " Susan Fletcher . " The woman smiled , holding out her slender hand . Becker took it . " David Becker . " " Congratulations , Mr. Becker . I hear you did a fine job today . Might I chat with you about it ? " Becker hesitated . " Actually , I 'm in a bit of a rush at the moment . " He hoped spurning the world 's most powerful intelligence agency was n't a foolish act , but his squash match started in forty-five minutes , and he had a reputation to uphold : David Becker was never late for squash ... class maybe , but never squash . " I 'll be brief . " Susan Fletcher smiled . " Right this way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NSA 's commissary enjoying a popover and cranberry juice with the NSA 's lovely head cryptographer , Susan Fletcher . It quickly became evident to David that the thirty-eight-year-old 's high-ranking position at the NSA was no fluke-she was one of the brightest women he had ever met . As they discussed codes and code-breaking , Becker found himself struggling to keep up-a new and exciting experience for him . An hour later , after Becker had obviously missed his squash match and Susan had blatantly ignored three pages on the intercom , both of them had to laugh . There they were , two highly analytical minds , presumably immune to irrational infatuations-but somehow , while they sat there discussing linguistic morphology and pseudo-random number generators , they felt like a couple of teenagers-everything was fireworks . Susan never did get around to the real reason she 'd wanted to speak to David Becker-to offer him a trial post in their Asiatic Cryptography Division . Continues ...
