The train charged forward in the shimmering afternoon sunlight , autumn 's vibrant colors forming a natural lane for the raised bed of chipped rock and the few hundred tons of steel and wood . The rails stretched out before the locomotive , light glinting off their polished surfaces , tricked by the eye into joining together a half mile in the distance , the illusion always moving forward at the speed of the train , as if those rails spread open just in time to carry her . For the driver of that freight , it was another day in paradise . Alone with his thoughts , he and his brakeman , pulling lumber and fuel oil , cotton and cedar , sixteen shipping containers , and seven empty flatbeds . Paradise was that sound in your ears and that rumble up your legs . It was the blue sky meeting the silver swipe of tracks far off on the horizon . It was a peaceful job . The best work there was . It was lights and radios and doing something good for peoplegetting stuff from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chewing tobacco deep between his cheeks and gum , his mind partly distracted by a bum air conditioner in the bedroom of a mobile home still miles away , wondering where the hell he 'd get the three hundred bucks needed to replace it . He could put it on the credit card , but that amounted to robbing Peter to pay Paul . Maybe some overtime . Maybe he 'd put in for an extra run . The sudden vibration was subtle enough that a passenger would not have felt it . A grinding , like bone rubbing on bone . His first thought was that some brakes had failed , that a compressor had failed , that he had a lockup midtrain . His hand reached to slow the mighty beast . But before he initiated any brakingbefore he only compounded the problemhe checked a mirror and caught sight of the length of her as the train chugged through a long , graceful turn and down a grade that had her really clipping along . It was then his heart did its first little flutter , then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his neck like someone had pulled on a cable . It was n't the brakes . A carnumber seven or eightwas dancing back there like she 'd had too much to drink . Shaking her hips and wiggling her shoulders all at once , kind of swimming right there in the middle of all the others . Not the brakes , but an axle . Not something that could be resolved . He knew the fate of that train before he touched a single control , before his physical motions caught up to the knowledge that fourteen years on the line brought to such a situation . In stunned amazement , he watched that car do her dance . What had looked graceful at first , appeared suddenly violent , no longer a dance but now a seizure as the front and the back of that car alternately jumped left to right and right to left , and its boxlike shape disintegrated to something awkwardly bent and awful . It leaned too far , and as it did , the next car began that same cruel jig . He pulled back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exercise in futility . The locomotive now roiled with a tremor that shook dials to where he could n't read them . His teeth rattled in his head as he reached for the radio . " Mayday ! " he shouted , having no idea why . There were codes to use , procedure to follow , but only that one word exploded from his mouth . The cars rolled now , one after another , first toward the back then forward toward the locomotive , the whole thing dragging and screaming , the beauty of its frictionless motion destroyed . The cars tilted right and fell , swiping the trees like the tail of a dragon , splintering and knocking them down like toothpicks , the sky littered with autumn colors . And then a ripple began as that tail lifted briefly toward the sky . The cars , one coupled to the next , floated above the tracks and then fell , like someone shaking a kink out of a lawn hose . Going for the door handle , he let go of the throttle , the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . He lost his footing and fell to the floor of the cab , his brain numb and in shock . He did n't know whether to jump or ride it out . He would later tell investigators that the noise was like nothing he 'd ever heard , like nothing that could be described . Part scream . Part explosion . A deafening , immobilizing dissonance , while the smell of steel sparking on steel rose in his nostrils and sickened his stomach to where he sat puking on the oily cab floor , crying out as loudly as he could in an effort to blot out that sound . He felt all ten tons of the engine car tip heavily right , waver there , precariously balanced up on the one rail , and then plunge to the earth , the whole string of freights buckling and bending and dying behind him in a massive pileup . He saw a flatbed fly overhead , only the blue sky behind it . This , his last conscious vision , incongruous and unfathomable . For forty long seconds the cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripped their way through soil and forest , carried by momentum until an ungainly silence settled over the desecrated track , and the orange , red , and silver leaves fell out of a disturbed sky as if laying a blanket over the face of a corpse .
