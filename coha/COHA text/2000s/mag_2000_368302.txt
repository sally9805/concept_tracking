Last week testy legislators pilloried Susan Bailey , head of the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration , for the agency 's slow-leak performance in the Firestone case . There 's just one problem : Congress helped puncture the agency 's effectiveness . In the 1980s , the Reagan Administration poleaxed nhtsa and other regulatory agencies as costly encumbrances to business . NHTSA 's current budget is $392 million , a third less in real terms than it was in 1980 . <P> Thus the scope of NHTSA 's work has been reduced . Until 14 years ago , it examined some 13,000 accidents annually , often visiting the scene and inspecting cars . That figure is currently just 5,000 . Morale , meanwhile , has plummeted . " They have suffered from a major brain drain of their most talented engineers and senior staff , " notes John Graham , director of the Center for Risk Analysis at Harvard 's School of Public Health . <P> NHTSA 's attempts to improve safety have also faced congressional roadblocks . Tire-safety standards have not budged for 32 years , despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of efforts to expand NHTSA 's regulatory powers are such pro-auto legislators as John Dingell , the House Commerce Committee 's senior Democrat , who is from Dearborn , Mich. ( an auto center ) , and Michael Oxley , a Republican from Finley , Ohio ( a tire center ) . Billy Tauzin , the committee 's chairman , from Louisiana , tried several years ago to cut back on NHTSA 's enforcement authority . <P> With the help of such legislators as Senator Patrick Leahy , who has proposed legislation to expand NHTSA 's scope , NHTSA may soon be able to change the way it does business . But as often occurs with such underfunded agencies , nothing happens until the bodies start piling up . <P>  --  By Adam Zagorin/Washington with reporting by Mike Eskenazi/New York
