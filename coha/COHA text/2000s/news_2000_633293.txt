<p> Taurus Raign is n't happy with his salad . <p> " I 'm not happy with my salad , " he confides to me , as I fiddle with my Sony TCS-58OV voice-activated tape recorder to see if the little red light is blinking , which indicates that the " Record " function is working and every word is indeed being captured on Side A of the Sony high-bias cassette . <p> Did I remember to buy backup batteries ? Double A ? Imagine how embarrassing it would be to have the batteries in one 's tape recorder go dead in the middle of an interview with the star of not only the seventh-highest-grossing movie of 2000 ( I 'm speaking of course about " Who 's Your Daddy ? " ) , but the fourth most popular coming-of-age episodic drama series on the WB ( I 'm speaking of course about the critically acclaimed " Homecoming King " ) . I can just picture Raign brushing the ash-blond hair out of his face , fixing his blue-green eyes on me and bellowing his trademark " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you , an idiot ? " <p> Hopefully that wo n't happen . But I take out my notebook and pen just in case the tape recorder fizzles out on me . <p> Damn . Wished I 'd learned shorthand in college . Wished I 'd taken a journalism class in college . Wished I 'd finished college . But what was I supposed to do when my girlfriend Candy ( not her real name ) got pregnant and her father , Lou ( not his real name ) , threatened to run me over with his Ford pickup if I did n't do the right thing and marry her and get a job ? I had no choice ! <p> Sadly , the marriage ended in divorce . But I 've got 24-year-old triplets who visit me twice a year , and you ca n't put a price tag on that . <p> Not that I 'm worrying about trivial matters like my kids when I 'm sharing the air in this trendy lunch spot with the multifaceted Taurus Raign , who demonstrates his athleticism by hurling his salad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the back of his head . <p> Unlike some stars of his generation , Raign does n't want to make a scene . He patiently sits back until the waiter regains consciousness and then keeps his voice low as he explains , " When I ordered this salad , I asked for the dressing on the side . Dude . It 's swimming in dressing . " <p> And then Raign turns to me . " Rich , you remember , do n't you ? ' On the side , ' that 's what I said . On . The . Side . " <p> I feel the breath squeeze right out of my lungs . We 've only just met a few minutes ago , but already Raign has stored away my name . Is it any wonder he received raves for his performance in David Mamet 's " Speed-the-Plow " at the Hackensack ( N.J. ) Repertory Theatre in 1997 , or that he was a gender-bending sensation as the lead in the Showtime production of " Annie Get Your Gun " just last year ? <p> Taurus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're going to be an actor . They do n't just make up those lines , you know . <p> I 'm here in Hollywood to interview Raign , who coincidentally has a new movie coming out next weekend . " Paper or Plastic ? " is the story of a stockboy in a small-town grocery store who discovers one day that he has the power to levitate his enemies , including the evil town mayor ( Dabney Coleman in a comeback role that already has some people talking Oscar or at least Golden Globe ) , who has recently dumped some 6 million gallons of toxic waste into a landfill just behind the local preschool . Christina Aguilera makes her film debut as the preschool teacher who is Raign 's love interest , and Bailey Joel Osmont , younger brother of Haley Joel Osmont ( " The Sixth Sense " ) , steals every scene he 's in as a precocious 6-year-old who first uncovers the poisonous nightmare . ( Osmont 's George W. Bush imitation is a hoot ! ) <p> As a media insider , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of you can see it next Friday . But you 'll have to pay . I did n't . ) I do n't want to give anything away here before I file a complete review on my Web site , www.mytwocents.com , but suffice to say that Raign 's dramatic muscles get a full workout , especially in the scenes at the end of the movie when he levitates Coleman on national TV and convinces the judge ( Alfre Woodard in a memorable cameo ) to rule in favor of the townsfolk  --  and then races to the hospital just in time to say goodbye to little Bailey Joel , who dies . <p> Not that the movie ends on a sad note . There 's a wedding with Aguilera that will bring a tear to your eye , especially when everyone breaks into a rousing chorus of Al Green 's " Let 's Stay Together . " <p> After seeing the movie , I got a good night 's sleep at my hotel room before waking up and coming to this restaurant for my exclusive luncheon interview with Raign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an actor , and as a human being " after a tumultuous 18 months that saw him hospitalized for exhaustion , in and out of rehab seven times for a nagging addition to pain-killers , married , divorced , married again and divorced again . On top of all that , he had to cope with such traumas as firing his agent ( who happens to be his twin brother ) , switching religions " three or four times " and causing a near-riot at the first annual Oktoberfest Film Festival in Munich , where the locals worship him as a god . <p> And now we 're bonding , me and Taurus . I wonder if he 'll ask me to join him and rumored paramour Jennifer Love Hewitt for dinner tonight ! I bet he could get us right into Spago without a hitch . <p> While waiting for his replacement salad , Raign sips an iced tea ( lemon , no sugar ) and makes several calls on his Nokia cellular phone . Scoop : One of the calls was to the kitchen . Raign instructed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back but to auction it on eBay and to give the proceeds to charity . <p> " If you ca n't use your fame to help losers and poor people , what 's the point of being famous ? " he tells me as he flashes a dazzling grin . <p> How do movie stars get their teeth so white ? It 's almost like magic . <p> I ask Raign about his famous first name . ( His last name , of course , is pronounced , " Rain . " ) Rumor is that he was named after his zodiac sign . <p> " Actually I 'm a Pisces , " he says . " Turns out my mother got mixed up somehow . I think she might have been nearsighted or something . Either that or she just liked the name Taurus better than Pisces . " <p> He pauses . Takes a deep breath . <p> " I 've never told anyone that before . " <p> The room is quiet . But with impeccable timing , Raign lightens the mood by sticking his foot out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying everywhere , and the whole room explodes with laughter . <p> Our time together is running short . There 's so much I want to ask him  --  plus I 'd like him to sign my forehead , to commemorate the day . <p> " What 's next ? " I ask him . <p> Raign sighs . " What 's next ? That 's the question , is n't it ? What 's next for Taurus Raign ? I know I 'm contractually bound to do three sequels to ' Who 's Your Daddy ? ' but I 'd also like to do something that 's really - - - - - - - important and also makes a - - - - - - - - of money , you know what I 'm saying ? Something like ' Titanic . ' Also also something where I get to rub butter on Charlize Theron . " <p> Interesting . <p> The main course will soon be here , which means I 've got to make way for the crew from E ! ' s " Celebrity Suckup " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads me away , as Raign calls out , " Later , dude . " <p> Later indeed . <p> Richard Roeper , who used to do REAL celebrity interviews for the Sun-Times , is hard at work on his next book , Parodies and Satire in Modern Newspapers : You Wo n't Believe What Some People Will Believe .
