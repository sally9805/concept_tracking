Dear Laird Hunt , <p> It was with great interest that I read the description of your novel and the accompanying biographical material that appeared this weekend in the monthly literary supplement to our otherwise dull and basically pretty crappy county paper . I was so intrigued , in fact , that no sooner had I finished reading it I made a trip into town to place an advance order with our local bookseller , who , I am happy to report , eventually came around to sharing my great interest in your " promising spy noir . " In fact , as soon as I had brought out the article , which describes your book as being " stylish in presentation and permeated by mystery of a sort at all levels , " I could see his interest had been piqued . The fact that you are portrayed as being " not unintelligent without in any way appearing to be so " also caught his attention , as did the description of your wide-ranging travels , " somewhat cosmopolitan air , " and recent decision to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all your energy on reflection and work . As I confessed to the bookseller when I had finished reading him the article , this retreat you have embarked on is something I have often longed for , but unfortunately we have quite a little household here . <p> Indeed , there are eight or so of us in our not-overlarge farmhouse , and , needless to say , time for serious reflection is circumscribed at best . Still , if peaceful interludes are few , charming domestic moments abound , and our little tribe , as my wife often refers to us , is happy enough . In fact , we are known as quite a jolly bunch throughout this " largely rural community of 2,000 souls , " as one of our officials has seen fit to have posted wherever the name of our county appears . Some of the merchants along the main street in town , including the bookseller , have also taken to displaying some approximation of this , let 's face it , rather idiotic phrase on their premises , so that it 's difficult not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go about your business , which in my case , after placing my order and chatting a bit , was to go home . <p> Home , as I have mentioned , is a fairly old farmhouse with a shed on two acres surrounded by a woods , which is rather overfilled at this moment with deer . These deer are a great delight to our children and seem more or less uninterested in my wife 's garden , so we have fallen into the habit of tolerating them . Anyway , they are always trimmed back a little in the autumn , when quite a good percentage of our county 's 2,000 souls slip on brightly colored outer garments , pick up their rifles , buy beer , and go tromping around in the underbrush . Once , soon after we left our pleasant apartment in the city and came here , my wife gave me enough encouragement to accept the loan of a firearm and spend some early morning time with a group of local men and women in a blind . Given your penchant for " bizarre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be interested to know that this term took on a special significance when after two or three beersoaked and bone-chilling hours , one of our party took a crack at something , only to discover that she had blown half the head off a stray dog . But of course they do , these local men and women , also hit the things they are licensed to , and I must say it is strangely beautiful to see the big carcasses in the backs of their trucks and ingeniously strapped onto their cars . <p> I wonder if you have tried venison . It is my understanding that not so terribly long ago quite a large part of the local diet here was made up of this nutritious if somewhat dark and stringy meat . It can no doubt be attributed to my overwhelmed , to say the least , frame of mind at being utterly surrounded , after so many years in the city , by crops and woodland , that learning about this dietary quirk soon after our arrival conjured up images of a land populated by buckskin-clad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great trepidation when confronted by wide open spaces and light . Of course , following this line of thought led me , inevitably , to speculate on the effects of my own diet ( and that of my wife and children ) , which up until our relocation to the countryside had largely consisted of frozen vegetables , pizza slices , and mashedmeat sandwiches . And while the results of this speculation were not so very lovely , either , they did fill me with the sharp pangs of nostalgia that are both the bane and comfort of the forcibly relocated and unfairly dispossessed . <p> But the countryside , as I 'm sure you are discovering , if that is where you are , has much to recommend it . There is , for example , the abundance here of all variety of wildlife , including , of course , the aforementioned deer and stray dogs , as well as squirrels , rabbits , raccoons , possums , ground hogs , chipmunks , snakes , ferrets , coyotes , wolves , bears , insects of all description , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old barn owl , with which , especially in the colder months , we have gotten on quite friendly terms . Ha , ha ! That must sound unusual . But it is nevertheless , in a curious way , quite true . It has a definite personality , this barn owl , almost , despite its status as a raptor , a sense of humor . One only wishes , at dull moments , it were capable of laughter . <p> So then , anyway , here we all are , in the countryside , to some extent now at home . I wonder if you yourself have adapted as well to your retirement from the world . When I was in his store , the bookseller and I discussed where you had gone , and , after a time , if you had gone anywhere at all . For my part , and this entered into our discussion , I am quite convinced that I could just as easily have gotten some rest , as they all told me I must , without taking the drastic course of leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God-forsaken place , but certain interested parties , my wife included , see it otherwise . The bookseller certainly sees it otherwise . <p> It 's the good old countryside and other largely rural areas that one needs , he said , as we stood there discussing your whereabouts . Medication alone ca n't adequately address these issues . <p> Medication ? I said . <p> He nodded . <p> How do you know ? I said . <p> Believe me , I know , he said . <p> I looked at him . He reached into his pocket and rattled a bottle of pills . I reached into my own and did the same . <p> Yes , he said , fresh air is just what our Mr. Hunt , now that he 's had his taste of success , has gone off in search of-once you 've got your medication sorted out , it 's the finest thing in the world . <p> Well , it isn't-I 'll take the city 's bad air any day . And of course there is absolutely no reason to think that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if many wellknown writers of spy noirs , as the bookseller pointed out , have been , but this is where we left it finally-with you sitting on a screened-in porch , a pill bottle in your breast pocket , sipping iced tea or something and chewing on a piece of straw . He is quite persuasive , the bookseller-there is no getting the better of him . Perhaps you will have a chance to meet him one of these days . If , as the article states you might , you decide to suspend your retreat and go on a book tour , the three of us , or just the two of us if you do n't , understandably , want to deal with him , could have a drink or even a light meal . If you like , I could show you around town afterwards . Perhaps , in fact , you enjoy hunting . I would be glad , if your visit corresponded to the correct season , to make some introductions . When all is said and done , there are more possibilities than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a quaint country dinner , one largely gleaned from my wife 's garden , is on the table in need of my attention , as are the children , who are beginning to make faces at each other and yell . I wish you all the very best and am counting the days until your novel , The Impossibly , arrives . <p> Dear Laird Hunt , <p> Your book has arrived . I am in love with its first line- " The first time we met it was about a stapler , I think . " I have even gone so far as to acquire my own " nice-enough-looking gray stapler " and to set it on the armrest of my favorite reading chair . How , on earth , did you settle on a stapler for the opening ? I ask that , of course , rhetorically , because it is the perfect device to immediately capture the reader 's attention . Moreover , I find it quite brilliant that you set off the opening of the sentence-in which the assertiveness of the stapler serves to underscore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his future sweetheart-with the delicious ambiguity of the " I think . " Surely , now , the reader says to him/herself , what follows will blend certainty and uncertainty in a most ingenious way . Bravo . The bookseller , while not quite as prepared to celebrate the first line as I was upon immediately throwing open the book when he put it into my hands , did comment on the " unusual nature " of the opening pages , and also on the way you seemed to have " chiseled out " your sentences rather than , as in so many contemporary works , having hacked or dynamited them out , so that the reader , depending on which metaphor is followed , is left with either splinters or rubble . <p> Oh , yeah ? I said . <p> That 's how I see it , he said . <p> Well , I said , that 's very , very interesting . <p> We then spent a little time discussing the fact that each copy of your book-presumably the entire print run-had been shrinkwrapped . <p> Damn shrinkwrap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bookseller , broached the subject . Not quite sure how to respond to this , to my mind , unnecessary vulgarity , I told him to watch his fucking mouth , and when , after a moment , he did n't say anything , indeed simply stared at me with said mouth slightly open , I told him I very much liked the damn shrinkwrap and wanted the damn shrinkwrap that corresponded to my copy back out of the trash . <p> Take it easy , he said . <p> What 's wrong with the shrinkwrap ? I said . <p> Nothing , it serves a purpose , it keeps fingerprints from smearing up the cover , it 's just that it means if I want my customers to be able to peruse them I have to unwrap each copy , and , as you can see , I ordered a lot of them . There was , in fact , quite a lovely stack of your gorgeous black and red book sitting near the counter , and at the sight of them I softened . Ha , ha , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , he said . <p> It 's just that , you know , I 'm kind of excited and ... <p> Yeah , yeah , okay , he said . <p> This , let 's face it , rather unfortunate interaction might have found itself prolonged had not , at that moment , another customer come in . <p> Hi , you must be here to get your copy of Laird Hunt 's The Impossibly , I said . <p> Whose what ? the **36;1429;TOOLONG young personage said . <p> It is a love story , I said , set against a backdrop of crime and deep confusion , and it has just become available , and you should buy a copy . <p> Uh , yeah , whatever , the guy said . <p> Thanks for coming in , the bookseller , speaking to me , said . <p> Anyway , as I have mentioned , I then went over to the stationery store and picked out a gray stapler , along with a suitable supply of chisel-head staples and paper , and , after waving your book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have passed since I wrote that last sentence . It is now well into the night , and all but my wife , who occasionally looks over at me with a curious expression , and my oldest son , who is constructing a most impressive tower or something with matchsticks , are tucked away in bed . I have spent most of the time , with the necessary domestic interruptions , including one near emergency involving one of my smaller girls and a hot piece of carrot , deeply engaged in your book , and it is only out of a powerful urge to capture several of my early impressions and convey them to you that I have left your little band of creepy vacationers comfortably ensconced in the old house in the country and , so to speak , come up for air . Before I launch , however , into encomiums , which you no doubt already hear echoing all around you , wherever you are , notwithstanding the one or two tedious initial reviews the bookseller felt obliged to make me aware of even before he had handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the defensive tone I struck ) and which , rest assured , I immediately put out of my mind , I would like to report to you one curiously pleasant side effect of reading your book . This is that I have felt compelled all through the evening to get up and trot around the house with the stapler , snapping it closed and releasing it as I go , thus sending the pretty little staples flying through the air . Of course , these escapades around the house , and once out into the yard , aroused the highest interest of the smaller of our children , all of whom asked , before bedtime , to have a turn at expelling staples , which I was only too pleased to grant . Eventually , I am happy to relate , even the older children and my wife took a turn , although the latter boringly held her hand cupped to catch the single expelled staple and felt obliged to wonder aloud why I did n't just whack the staples into the sheets of paper I had brought home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And this way it is as if we are inviting all the various dark and lovely portions of the air to enter into binding relationships . <p> The staples are just falling onto the floor , she said . <p> I said " as if , " I said . <p> You ca n't staple the air , she said . <p> Look , I know , I said . <p> But there is no doubt in my mind that she was pleased to see me in such high spirits . And , Mr. Hunt , I am . Delectation is far from being too strong a word . Frankly , I have no idea what those several hack reviewers were going on about and why what I once considered to be distinguished journals would choose to print their gross inaccuracies . Opaque ? I prefer , if the challenging nature of the work is to be discussed , to refer to its shimmering opacity , to the pellucid nature of its incipient darkness , to the uncompromising insistence on resonance as a vehicle for emotion , or escape from emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation has brought me back to my little lamplit table here in the star and moon-burnished countryside , so far from the city where , as I think I wrote you previously , I spent the vast majority of the earlier portions of my life . It is here , it goes more or less without saying , that I , like your nameless protagonist , have fallen into a numbing anonymity . This in spite of the various troubling circumstances I left behind in the city . What exciting days they were ! What nights ! You should have seen me then-a nifty fan indeed I would have made for you in my dark suits and highly polished shoes , strolling down the avenue with a mashed-meat sandwich in one hand . This is how , by the way , I picture your excellent narrator : a little short , perhaps , a little fat , but undeniably elegant as he strolls along the boulevards , popping in and out of alleys and shop fronts , eating and carrying out his " business " or , with such irresolute resoluteness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countryside of rolling hills and olive groves and sweet , soft winds , where , as I say , I have left the narrator in the company of his creepy " friends , " I suspect he might have loosened his collar a little and even left his tie behind , but I still see him wearing his suit , just as I do when in the early pages of the novel he spends all that time moping around , scribbling on the ceiling or lying on the floor . <p> Reading back through those last lines , I find I 'm not at all sure why I was going on about the narrator wearing a suit or even why it occurred to me that you would care one way or the other about my opinion on the subject . I have often wondered , and am now wondering , if significant specimens of the imaginative faculty such as yourself give a fucking shit what your readers think . I just asked my wife . She says she does n't think you do , and that I should come to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went to the window to have a look at the dim , largely rural world waking around me . It seems especially appropriate that I should have fallen asleep so soon after having read the last lines of your book , and that I should , albeit without floating up the side of a water tower as the narrator does , wake just in time to see the " faint blue light of the approaching dawn : ' It would be hard to convey the extraordinary mix of impressions I felt swirling around in me as I stood there at the window , and only grogginess kept me from hollering and running around . I do n't think it would be going too far , Mr. Hunt , to suggest that I looked out onto a world that had been changed by my reading of your spy/detective novel , and while I am still not in a position to describe just how it had changed and might not be for quite some time , if ever , I can say that the prospect of this transformation was , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Since I wrote that last sentence , my wife and children have made their appearance . Because it is a weekend , this has meant one of our grand breakfasts , with eggs and juice for all , and/or coffee , if coffee is indicated . Weekend breakfasts in our household are my responsibility . I have to say that in honor of the unforgettable opening pages of the second section of your book in which so much food gets so stylishly wolfed down , I came very close indeed to making a quick trip into town for pastries , or at least donuts and a large country loaf , not to mention a good piece of sausage , to augment our standard fourteen-egg , three-cheese omelet . It was my wife who nipped this pretty impulse in the bud . <p> No , she said . <p> Are you sure , you see , on page 107 .... I started . <p> Yes , I 'm sure , buster , she said . <p> Ha , ha ... , I tried . <p> Ha , ha , yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't to be swayed , I picked up my stapler and your book , set them on the counter beside me and , letting out an excited little yelp now and then , set to cooking . You will be happy to know that I did manage , in the end , to squeeze in a little tribute to your work in the form of the voluminous slices of lunch meat substance I draped over each of my customers ' plates , and by doubling the amount of coffee I prepared . When one or two of the more staid of my children shot their meat-laden eggs inquiring looks , my wife remarked , " Your father was up all night reading , " to which I added , taking my own place at the table , " A marvelous and wonderful and splendid book . " <p> Is it about the stapler , Dad ? asked my littlest girl , who had , to her credit , an entire slice of lunch meat substance on her fork . <p> It is not only about a stapler , I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not to mention a beekeeper with a rotting nose and a man who gets to be a ghost . <p> I grinned . My family all sort of looked at me . <p> Tonight , I said , picking up the stapler with a flourish , I 'll read you some of it . <p> A promise , Mr. Hunt , I intend to keep and one we can now both be assured they will thank me for . <p>
