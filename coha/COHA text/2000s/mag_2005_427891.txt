- Jan 6 , 2006 1 Munich The word suspense has a fanciful , only-in-the-movies aura . Steven Spielberg 's brilliant political thriller is a work of spectacular and unsettling excitement , but it 's driven , in every frame , by the heightened suspense of reality . Taking off , with jittery media urgency , from the 1972 Olympics hostage crisis , which ended with the murder of 11 Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists , Spielberg plunges the audience into Israel 's legendary shadow mission of reprisal . Eric Bana , as the leader of a clandestine hit squad of furious , quibbling , at times comically earnest Jewish journeyman-soldiers , creates a hero of naive and wrenching nobility : a deadly mensch . As he and his fellow operatives navigate a world of jerry-rigged explosives , sleazy Continental information peddlers , and split-second getaways through the labyrinth of urban Europe , their trek of vengeance teeters between the holy and the unholy , and Spielberg , mixing fact and speculation , stages the mission as it might actually have occurred-the victories , the cataclysmic mistakes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewed as a statement on our world of terror , but not because Spielberg or co-screenwriter Tony Kushner take any incendiary stand on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . Rather , it 's because the movie , in the mesmerizing hair-trigger truths of its action , reveals how political murder , even when it 's justified , is less a solution than a virus , one that infects the attackers as much as the enemy . 2 King Kong Peter Jackson 's king-size remake is n't perfect , but it has a marvelous fairy-tale kinetic grandeur . Kong , with his matted hair and worn-down front choppers , his beady eyes agleam with curiosity , is a mangy , fearsome jungle giant who wins over Naomi Watts ' Ann Darrow through the very quality that terrifies her : his savagery-which becomes his brutish ability to protect her . Offhand , I ca n't think of a film I 've loved this much in which the two lead actors were merely adequate . Jack Black , though he tries to put the brakes on his ironic spin , still looks out of place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brody just looks depressed , but the effect of these two flyweight performances is to set off the film 's one true lord of a male-Kong , the raging beast vexed , and touched , by beauty . The battle with the T. rexes is a cathartic clash of the titans , but it 's in New York that King Kong attains a primal-pop romantic glory , as Watts , with scarcely a line to speak , infuses her devotion to Kong with a purity worthy of a great silent film . When the big guy finally climbs the Empire State Building , his battle with the biplanes is such an emotionally heightened piece of bedazzling choreography that you watch it in a state of simultaneous laughter , vertigo , and tears . 3 Brokeback Mountain In 1963 , on a cold and lonely Wyoming mountain , a couple of ranch hands share the same sleeping bag , then a lot more than that , and in that furtive , rustling moment of passion you can hear the tremors of a Hollywood earthquake . Gruff , bottled-up Ennis ( Heath Ledger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in a world where the feeling they discover for each other is n't allowed or acknowledged . They barely even realize that the feeling is called love . The beauty of Ang Lee 's quietly revolutionary weeper is that as it gazes upon these two yearning cowboys with a melancholy tenderness that mirrors their own , everything the film shows us that 's repressive and even tragic-the secrecy , the months and years apart , the lives broken into pieces-only serves to heighten the incandescence of their bond . That , of couine , has always been the way of luscious big-screen romances , from Casablanca to The Way We Were , and Brokeback Mountain , in joining their ranks , asks us to consider whether a world that denies love-any love-can truly be the one we want . 4 The Century of the Self Most documentaries explore a reality you can see : penguins , quadriplegic rugby players , grizzly men . The Century of the Self ushers us into something richer and vaster , more heady and exhilarating and profound . It 's the epic chronicle of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nephew of Sigmund Freud , changed not just what we do but who we are , transforming life into a perpetual quest for personal validation at the expense of everything else . The director , Adam Curtis , who made this amazing four-hour film for the BBC , is at once a psychologist , a historian , a fearless cultural detective , and a wizard of images to rival Oliver Stone at his most inspiringly Stoned . Curtis , who expands and explodes your perceptions , connects the rise of mainstream psychiatry , the marketing of Adolf Hitler , the postwar consumer culture , the ' ' 70s human-potential movement , and much more . The result is a visionary trip through the mass consciousness of the 20th century . 5 Match Point To call it Woody Allen 's comeback would be an understatement-it 's the most vital return to form for any director since Robert Altaian made The Player . Jonathan Rhys Meyers , with eyebrows serious enough to rival Montgomery Clift 's , is squirmy yet sympathetic as an earnest young London climber who insinuates himself into his girlfriend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or his mitts , off her brother 's fiance : a luscious mound of trouble played by Scarlett Johansson with a husky voice and neurotic little-girl smolder that barely camouflage her desperate , lovelorn spirit . Hooked on the poshness of an upperbourgeois life , but addicted even more to Johansson 's charms , Rhys Meyers tries to have both-a doomed quest that Allen , liberated from all his musty Upper West Side tropes , turns into the sexiest , most closely observed adultery drama in years . Match Point is a fiendishly clever and sophisticated entertainment driven by lust , murder , and the swinging hinge of fate . 6 Junebug At last , a comedy of family dysfunction that 's soulful and moonstruck instead of glib and reductive . The moment that Embeth Davidtz , as a Chicago art gallery owner , steps into the deep-fried middle-class gloom of her husband 's Southern clan , she knows she 's entered an alien landscape . As she attempts to ingratiate herself , the director , Phil Morrison , invites us to laugh at the cracked spectacle of homespun Dixie neurosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like he 's been nursing his rage since the Civil War ) , but he also reveals a family held together by bonds too deep to be spoken . As the brother 's pregnant wife , Amy Adams is an incandescent chatter-box , and when she gives birth , Junebug turns into a spiritual tug-of-war between ambition and loyalty . It 's a " small " movie that speaks wistful volumes about faith and devotion , about the ways that families push us apart in order to pull us together . 7 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory When Tim Burton 's mojo is working , your eyes im pop out in wonder-but , more than that , you giggle at the insanity of what 's making them pop . Burton 's adaptation of the Roald Dahl novel is a delectable sweet-and-sour madhouse kiddie musical , with a Dr. Seuss-meets-Dickens design and a loopy yet unabashed reverence for all things candified . You wo n't begin to enjoy it , though , unless you get on the wavelength of Johnny Depp , who plays Willy Wonka as a milky-skinned misanthrope who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His performance is a put-on laced with perverse sincerity . 8 Hustle &; Flow Terrence Howard , as a Memphis pimp who looks at his life and sees a dead end , acts in his own hypnotic space , evoking the scruffy desperation of a small-time player 's dreams with a vividness that invites comparison to Brando . As he records a crunk tape in his rec room , the movie opens a door on the vast and vital universe of home-made hip-hop that Hollywood has all but ignored . The writer-director , Craig Brewer , has made a gritty , lived-in , up-from-the-streets fable , as compulsively watchable as Saturday Night Fever or 8 Mile , yet Hustle &; Flow took brickbats for its lack of " authenticity " - as if Brewer 's attempt to treat a pimp as sympathetic , instead of as the Antichrist , was the first example in film history of romanticizing a criminal . 9 Her Shoes What if they made a sublime chick flick and nobody came ? Toni Collette , as a lawyer who 's unlucky in love , and Cameron Diaz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make you believe they 're family in a way that Hollywood actors almost never do , and Shirley MacLaine , ditching her imp-harridan mannerisms , plays their grandmother as the shrewdest of elderly angels . Curtis Hanson directs this charmed confection with a romance and pain , a frivolity and grace , that will leave you laughing through tears . 10 Tony Takitani A quiet dream of a movie-it 's like Vertigo refashioned into a sedately haunted Japanese tone poem . In middle age , a lonely and pensive illustrator ( Issey Ogata ) meets the amour of his life , then makes the innocent mistake of objecting to her one eccentricity : a consuming addiction to beautiful clothes . But her flaw , it turns out , was n't a flaw ; it was her . In its exquisite and understated way , Tony Takitani is a warning : It captures the tragic fragility with which even true love can be capsized from within . The Worst 1 The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy The world ends with a whimsical thud in this nattering fiasco of cosmic annoyance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot so coy it 's like an intergalactic Laugh-In written by Garrison Keillor . This is why the ' ' 70s had to end . 2 The Libertine Johnny Depp , in musketeer curls , turns to the camera and says , " You will not like me . " He 's right : We wo n't like him because he 's a big smug verbose bore mouthing " literate " NyQuil dialogue . 3 Domino Domino Harvey , the daughter of moviestar royalty-turned-bounty hunter , is the perfect Tony Scott character : a real person whose life scans as a glam-junkie action clich . In this Natural Barn Ciphers , the film stock exudes more personality than the actors . 4 Syriana Characters with invisible agendas ; events that do n't connect ; conversation that sounds like it was translated from the Morse code ; a conspiracy so obscure , vast , and ethereal that its tentacles remain hidden by other tentacles : Is this Mideast oil politics-or inept filmmaking ? In Stephen Gaghan 's serpentine head-scratcher , it is both . Here 's the insidious thing : The more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be pointing toward a Big Explanation ( please , say it 's coming in the next scene ! ) , the one that will reveal everything . Or nothing . 5 Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance Most bloodsoaked exploitation films deliver the goods like porn . Park Chanwook 's are different . Far more than even Oldboy , his rambling vulgarization of Cape Fear , this butcher-brained South Korean revenge fantasy is so convoluted and ponderous that you end up borderline grateful for the sick-puppy tidbits of torture and gore , which at least keep you awake . Now , that 's exploitation .
