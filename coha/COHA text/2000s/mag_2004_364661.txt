The beautiful people were back . After a lackluster 2003 session of mediocre films and low celebrity wattage , this year 's Cannes Film Festival atoned in substance and style . It boasted a stronger slate of movies ( potent new works from Pedro Almodovar , Wong Kar-wai , Zhang Yimou and Jean-Luc Godard ) and burst with star power under the brilliant Riviera sun . Waving from the red-carpeted steps of the Grand Palais were your Hankses and Diazes , your Brad Pitts and Mike Myerses  --  enough representatives of the rich and famous to fill a Cabala convention . <P> For all those eight-figure earners , the largest presence at this French film fete was a fellow from Flint , Mich. , who 's usually seen in a scruffy beard and duck-hunter couture . Michael Moore was prowling the Riviera , and this time the game he aimed at was George W. Bush . Bull's-eye ! His Fahrenheit 9/11 captured Cannes 's highest prize , the Palme d'Or , from a jury headed by Quentin Tarantino . " What have you done ? " the winner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mess with me . " <P> Moore should be used to prizes by now . His 2002 Bowling for Columbine earned $58 million worldwide and an Oscar nod that Moore turned into a decisive media event when , in his acceptance speech , he scolded the President for invading Iraq . So Cannes was primed for his latest movie Molotov cocktail . Its first screening , on a Monday at 8 a.m. , got total team news coverage ; a dozen or so radio and TV crews circled the U.S. critics to get their early reaction as Miramax Films co-chairman Harvey Weinstein , whose Disney bosses had forbidden him to release the film , paced nearby and chortled , " They say I 've lost my edge ? Have I lost my edge ? " He had not . He spent the rest of the week negotiating with a flock of U.S. distributors hoping to profit from the film 's marketable notoriety . <P> Left-wing documentaries are nothing new . In fact , with the exception of Leni Riefenstahl 's Nazi-rally film Triumph of the Will , it 's hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone in his obsession with the Republican elite . Among the festival screenings were the documentary Bush 's Brain ( about adviser Karl Rove ) and a fact-based drama , The Assassination of Richard Nixon , starring Sean Penn and Naomi Watts . But Fahrenheit 9/11 had all the hot press . And it more than lived up to its advance rep . <P> The film details , with Moore 's usual mix of flippant comedy and moral outrage , the case for the prosecution in the left vs . Bush : the Bush Administration 's invasion and occupation of Iraq , its Patriot Act clamping down on civil liberties and its cozy relationship with the ruling families of Saudi Arabia , including the bin Ladens . Moore is particularly indignant that the President had a chummy White House visit on Sept. 13 , 2001 , with Prince Bandar bin Sultan of Saudi Arabia , from whose country 15 of the 19 hijackers had come , and that in the dire days after 9/11 , when U.S. flights were grounded , two dozen of Osama bin Laden 's relatives were flown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question them .
