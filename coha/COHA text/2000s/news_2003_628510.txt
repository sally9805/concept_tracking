<p> After Wednesday night 's final U.S. practice at Reliant Stadium , coach Bruce Arena either gave a little glimpse into what he expected on Thursday or was providing the media a little cultured gamesmanship . <p> " Mexico will look a little better as a team , " Arena said . <p> In fact , it was Arena who , over a month earlier on a trip to Houston , made it clear that Mexico has a clearly defined style while the United States continues to refine and identify its own . <p> Mexico won the battle of aesthetics and possession , but the final score was a fair 0-0 with an improved performance in the second half by the United States , which was dangerous on occasion on the counterattack . <p> The match was typical U.S.-Mexico , in which every ball is contested with every ounce of will a human being possesses . <p> Despite the 0-0 score , there were many interesting storylines . <p> For the United States , young players such as Tim Howard in goal and Danny Califf and Carlos Bocanegra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Young stars DaMarcus Beasley and Landon Donovan continue to be players your eyes are drawn to with their movement and mobility . Mexico showed its respect for these two young stars by getting a second and third defender to the ball whenever Beasley and Donovan were in possession . <p> Chris Armas made a healthy return and Arena was wise in playing Pablo Maestroeni next to him in midfield to aid in his transition back to the national team after knee surgery . The absence of a player the caliber of Claudio Reyna , who is rehabbing an injury , stands out because his calming influence on the ball would have been beneficial on a night like Thursday . <p> In Reyna 's absence , Clint Mathis provided two or three penetrating balls in the first half that led to potential goal-scoring opportunities for the United States . <p> Young Bobby Convey provided a spark off the bench with subtle touches and elusive moves and made decisions beyond his years . Veteran Earnie Stewart came off the bench in the second half to give the United States a boost with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball laced wide to Cobi Jones by Stewart that initiated a late attack that ended with a header by Chris Klein that just missed . <p> For Mexico , the infusion of youth by Argentine head coach Ricardo La Volpe looked impressive , but it was veterans who provided the glue . Goalkeeper Oswaldo Sanchez of Chivas was composed beyond belief with the ball at his feet . Club America 's Duilio Davino was a study in positional play and composed defending , while attacker Jesus Arellano of Monterrey reminded us why he is Mexico 's most dangerous offensive threat . Omar Bravo of Chivas provided sparkling moments in the attack . <p> But on a historic night in Houston , the actual game was secondary . <p> It was a night of gratitude , respect and emotion . <p> Gratitude to U.S. Soccer , the Texans organization and all who organized the event , and to a stunning show of passion from soccer fans in the Houston area and from around the country who attended . <p> The constant thunderous roar of the record-setting crowd could be felt in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world . Standing behind one of the goals , I had chills down my spine looking at Reliant Stadium and thinking that one day when the men 's World Cup comes back to the United States , this stadium would be the perfect host to a World Cup final . <p> Green Mexico national team jerseys were dominant in the crowd , and the presence of red for the United States was easily identifiable , showing that fan support and growth for the U.S. team continues to grow . <p> Los Angeles Coliseum this was not . This crowd reflected the great diversity of Houston . <p> The game again proved , in a way only it can , that soccer is a uniting force that reminds and teaches us that it is exclusive to no one . More than 69,000 smiling faces came together in Houston in appreciation for a game that has amazing and sometimes magical powers . <p> We all came in camaraderie and mutual respect on a night on which all of our worries were released for a couple of hours thanks to the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in from around the country and the world , we await your return . It is nice to know that the common thread of a sport unites us no matter what country we are in . <p> Around the world <p> On the road in Kansas City- While calling last weekend 's game for HDNet at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City , it was clear to me that attendance is up for the Wizards . MLS all-time leading scorer Preki , who will turn 40 next month , continues to beat people and create chances in MLS . He is a truly remarkable athlete . <p> The Wizards and and Crew tied 2-2 after 10 minutes of golden goal overtime . The Wizards , already a little unstable at the back , suffered a huge blow when Jose Burciaga Jr . from the Dallas area went down with a knee injury that will keep him out indefinitely . The Wizards may go to a four-back system as Burciaga 's injury affects other areas of the team . <p> Meanwhile , it was good to see Missouri City 's Eric Quill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overtime . Quill will be in Dallas today as the Wizards take on the Burn . <p> Tournament teams set - The 2002 MLS Cup champion Los Angeles Galaxy will face Sao Paolo ( Brazil ) , Roma ( Italy ) and PSV Eindhoven ( Netherlands ) at the inaugural World Peace King Cup tournament July 15-22 in South Korea .

The winning team will receive $ 2 million . . . . A.C. Milan and Inter Milan played to a 0-0 draw in their first leg of the Champions League semifinals . . . . Christie Welsh of the New York Power was named the WUSA Player of the Week for scoring two goals in a 5-4 victory over the Philadelphia Charge . The Houston area 's Krista Davey scored the game-winner in stoppage time as the Power hit for two goals in the final five minutes to win the goalfest .

Defender Craig Ziadie of the MetroStars was named the MLS Player of the Week after scoring a goal and recording an assist in a 2-1 victory over the Colorado Rapids . . . . Ronnie O'Brien of the Dallas Burn had surgery Tuesday to repair a fractured right fibula . O'Brien , who was once on the books at Juventus in Italy , is expected to be lost for the remainder of the season , adding to Dallas ' injury woes in midfield . The Irishman signed with the Burn in 2002 as a discovery player . <p> Matter of respect - Former local youth player Rusty Pierce of The Woodlands , who now plays for the New England Revolution , wants respect . <p> With the U.S. national team looking to groom young defenders , Pierce believes he is on a par with players like Dan Califf ( Los Angeles ) , Nick Garcia ( Kansas City ) and Carlos Bocanegra ( Chicago ) , all of whom were among the 18 players selected by coach Bruce Arena for Thursday 's friendly against Mexico at Reliant Stadium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line as those guys and feel I should be mentioned in the same breath as them , " said Pierce , who battled groin injuries all last year . " For me , it has been very frustrating . " <p> Coachspeak - U.S. coach Bruce Arena on 23-year-old goalkeeper Tim Howard : " I think in some ways at this stage he is ahead of Brad Friedel and Kasey Keller . He is outstanding , as is Aidan Brown . " <p> Arena on veteran Earnie Stewart and young star DaMarcus Beasley : " We have a 34-year-old ( Stewart ) who does n't think he is 34 , and we have a 19-year-old who does n't think he is 19 ( Beasley ) . " <p> U.S.-Mexico thoughts - Former Columbus Crew general manager Jamey Rootes , now a senior vice president with the Texans , shared his thoughts on the U.S.-Mexico game last week . <p> Rootes on Texans involvement : " This is the beginning of a very important platform for our organization to manage , market , and promote world-class sporting events . The first place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global appeal . " <p> Rootes on Major League Soccer expanding to Houston : " Is it feasible for MLS to be successful week in and week out ? The three components are the market , stadium and ownership . There is potential for great ownership but it is not lined up . " <p> Rootes on MLS stadium and ownership models : " There are two models - stand-alone ventures like the Columbus Crew and Los Angeles Galaxy , who have soccer specific stadiums , and the other one is to partner the team with an NFL team . It can work either way ; both have challenges . " <p> Rootes on Houston as a sports town : " It 's not just a football town . It 's a world-class sporting community . We have chosen to be world-class .
