FROM THE EDITORS OF MAXIM Headnote The men of Maxim have opened up their little black strategy books to reveal all the sly tricks and covert operations the male species employs when dating us ( the horror ! ) . Study up on this classified info and you 'll be fully armed in time for your next rendezvous . // Women play relationship games to win-the smarter sex ( yup , that 's you ) practically has the head game patented . But we guys are catching on to your wily ways , and we 're starting to spring our own fair share of sly moves on those ever-important first few dates . Sure , our schemes may not be quite as suave as yours ( we are guys , after all ) , but we fully realize that they can confuse , annoy , and otherwise torment the hell out of you when you 're trying to get to know us . So listen up : We , the editors of Maxim , are about to let you in on a slew of the most top secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new man . Whether or not that 's a good thing , of course , is your call . 1 . The Ambush Game Date pick-up time is eight o'clock . We show up at 7:45 . Why ? The truth is , we play it so punctual because we want to see what you really look like ... you know , before you get a chance to put on your makeup mask and eye goo . It also allows us to get you flustered and take you off your game a bit . Do you feel the need to be seen as perfect , so you 'll leave us waiting outside ? Or will you invite us in while you finish your hair , asking us to make ourselves comfortable ? How you respond tells us how you 'll react later on when things do n't go exactly as you 'd planned , not to mention whether you 'll be a self-conscious mess or a wildcat in the sack . 2 . The X-Ray Style Game All it takes is a feigned interest in your new boots ( trust us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we learn more about you than your favorite Sex and the City character reveals . If your response is something like " Thanks ! I just bought " em last week at this designer store , they 're Italian-made ... here , feel the leather ! Blah blah blah , " we sense that you 're materialistic , hard to please , and a spendaholic . But if you say " Thanks ! I got them on sale ; they were such a good deal " and move on , you 're likely down-to-earth and have a decent credit-card balance-so you probably wo n't ransack our wallets ( score ! ) . 3 . The Dinner Game When the restaurant check comes , we 'll leave it sitting there between us for an uncomfortably long period of time , until you might consider reaching for it . Then we swoop in , making a big show of gallantly taking it first as if we would never even consider having you pay . Sure , springing for the meal makes us look sweet and is the socially acceptable thing to do ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ) , but we also get to run a quick personality test . You 'll ( a ) protest politely , ( b ) act all pissed off and give us a rant about the patriarchy , or ( c ) not notice because you never so much as tip . If you choose b or c , we know not to waste our money again . 4 . The Manners Game A classic is the car-door test ( mastered by Campbell Scott in Singles ) : After we let you in the passenger side , do you lean over to unlock the driver 's door ? If you do , you 'll probably be a thoughtful girlfriend who brings us soup when we 're sick and sends us to fantasy baseball camp . If not , you 're probably a bit self-centered . There 's also the Station Game , where we let you have ( momentary ) control of the car radio to see whether you 'll try to find something we both like or selfishly go to the emasculating love songs of Enrique Iglesias . Think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a good gauge of how much control you 'll assume over most decisions we make , from the TV clicker and vacation destinations to car purchases and new sex positions ( not that we mind being dominated , oh no ! ) . 5 . The Movie Quiz Game We 'll casually slip a classic guy movie line into conversation , like " Thank you , sir ! May I have another ? " or " So I got that going for me , which is nice . " ( For the record , that 's Animal House and Caddy-shack , respectively . ) Do n't worry , we do n't really expect you to start speaking exclusively in movie quotes like guys do , but if you at least laugh a bit , we 're golden : We have similar cultural taste and plenty to talk about , and you think we 're mildly funny , which is key . If you get annoyed or stare at us blankly , however , we 'll take you straight back home to your cave . Clearly we 're not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you 'll have to have when you finally see us naked . Next ! 6 . The Chivalry Game If you get chilly at some point ( which is pretty much a given on any date , regardless of the season ) , we 'll be quick to remove our jacket or scarf and slide it around you . You 'd think it would go against everything we believe in to put more clothing on you , but we 're making a horndog covert attack here . We get an easy way to throw our arm around you , but we 're also pulling you closer to us on a psychological level . Plus , you now consider our clothes to be familiar territory and will hopefully work your way out of your own later . 7 . The Sexy Segue Game By the third glass of wine on the first or second date , we 'll carefully shift the conversation over to something sex related , like how the couple at the next table looks ready to bump uglies . We do this to con you into relating some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're right about that couple over there ! I think they should skip dessert and just get a hotel room , do n't you ? " Ahhh . The words dreams are made of . But if you wrinkle your nose at our observation , we 'll think you 're either a prude or not attracted to us. 8 . The Voice-Mail Game You already blew the cover off our three-day calling rule , so most guys do n't follow it anymore . Now we go out of our way to dial you up when we know you 're not home . " Hey , I had a great time the other night , " we 'll say . " Call me . " By sounding cool and as if we 're in a hurry , we keep you guessing about how hot we are for you ( even if we 're sitting on the couch watching World 's Strongest Man and making a model of your naked body with mashed potatoes ) . Note : There is a Law of Inverse Interest at work . The more we drool over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the phone . Do n't blame us-you 're the ones who practically padlock your bras if we act too desperate . Sidebar Games You Play We 've caught on to these old classics , so retire them ! The Wingwoman Game Towing your " cute " friend along ( read : not actually cute ) to the bar just to make yourself look better . The Blue-Balls Game You get all hot and heavy at the end of the date ... then leave us with a quick peck on the front porch . The Small Gift Game You carefully instruct us not to get you anything for your birthday , then get mad when we do n't . The Comparison Game You drop hints about random chicks ( " Is n't she pretty ? " ) to see if we think they 're hotter than you . // <p>
