Going West // Bundled in a heavy winter coat and sporting a beaverskin hat , Daniel Farrell Reeves dug his hands into his pockets and marched from the gate bordering the stands out onto the field in the cavernous Cleveland Stadium . In a matter of hours , his Cleveland Rams would take the field to play the Washington Redskins for the championship of the National Football League . But as he surveyed the field in the numbing chill of this overcast morning two days before Christmas , Reeves could see nothing on the gridiron but thousands of bales of straw , and a small army of men laboring to move them . This was pro football in 1945. // Compact and slender , no more than 5-foot-8 and 140 pounds , Reeves was // a man of reserved nature but wry wit . In four seasons , he had grown accustomed to the perennial financial losses  --  " Irish dividends , " as he called them  --  common to owning a pro football team . But the 1945 season had been uniquely rewarding and frustrating . Reeves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-year tour of duty with the Army Air Corps , to what would become a season-long victory celebration . America ? s triumph in World War II had been officially consecrated during August two-a-days , and the long lines that greeted the end of gas rationing dissipated by the season-opening win over the Chicago Cardinals . Just one season after the 1944 squad lost six of its last seven games , the Rams had rebounded to become the surprise of the NFL , and win their first Western Conference title . In early December , rookie quarterback Bob Waterfield , soon to be named the league ? s Most Valuable Player , was profiled in Life magazine . And though the article spent less time on Waterfield than his wife  --  Hollywood bombshell Jane Russell , star of Howard Hughes ? s " sex western " The Outlaw , which censors still hadn ? t allowed to be screened in the U.S.  --  the mere thought that a player for the Cleveland Rams would merit space in Life seemed to Reeves a miracle in itself . // After the Washington Redskins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Reeves ? s dream match-up was set . For the title game , the Redskins would make their first trip to Cleveland in eight seasons , bringing along their famed 110-piece marching band to perform a special Christmas-themed halftime show . Interest was high for the match-up between the rookie Waterfield and perennial All-Pro Slingin ? Sammy Baugh . And so Reeves had bravely decided to move the championship game from the Rams ? regular stadium , the deteriorating League Park , with its cramped capacity of 30,000 , to Cleveland Stadium , which seated 80,000. // Six days before the game , the National Weather Service had forecast a major winter storm hitting the Cleveland area in midweek , so the Rams had spent the early part of the week searching for enough bales of straw to cover the tarpaulin , to prevent the field from freezing . It was general manager Charles " Chile " Walsh who finally located 9,000 bales of straw from around Elyria , and had it delivered to the stadium at a cost of $7,200 . In the days leading up to the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stadium resembling an arctic snowscape , with drifts piled several feet high in the aisles . // On Sunday morning , the Rams lined up 275 workers , many of them off-duty city employees , to remove the bales . While the Rams were responsible for the field , the city of Cleveland was responsible for the stadium and the parking lots , which were left unshoveled . Despite the weather and conditions , the Associated Press projected the game would draw 50,000 , and the New York Times wrote that " a crowd of better than 40,000 is almost certain with a capacity audience of 77,569 possible in case the forecasters are wrong . " // But when the lights were turned on at Cleveland Stadium at 6:30 the morning of the game , the temperature was eight degrees below zero . Marching in mucklucks from the Clevelander Hotel a little before eight , Reeves balefully noted the unpassable streets . There was no parking in the two blocks closest to the stadium , since that area was overrun with snow . And taxi service wasn ? t running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rams and Arthur McBride , owner of the Zone/Yellow Cab Co. and the new Cleveland entry in the All-America Football Conference , which would begin competition in Cleveland the following fall . // By 10:30 that morning most of the 9,000 bales had been cleared off the field . But the trucks that were to transport them away had trouble gaining purchase on the still clogged city streets , leaving the workers no choice but to place the straw against the walls surrounding the playing field . Behind the benches , just in back of the end zones , and stacked more than ten bales high at the walls , the sea of straw was parted so the game could be played . // Cleveland Stadium had rarely looked so empty as on this day , when only 32,178 turned out . When former Rams business manager Manny Eisner and his wife walked into the stadium about an hour before kickoff , there were already people filing out , succumbing to the cold . In the stadium ticket office , Lou Isaacson was more prepared than most . Dressed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two pairs of pants , two sweaters , and two coats , he sat in the unheated box office for four and a half hours , and sold two tickets . // In financial terms , Reeves had already resigned himself to the realization that his share of the gate wouldn ? t even pay for the cost of buying , transporting , and removing the bales of straw . But as the kickoff neared , none of that mattered . Up in the press box , Reeves was nervous and amiable , greeting writers and VIPs , accepting congratulations for signing Waterfield to a three-year contract the day before . " The stars are making so much money now , I call them ? Mister ? and they just call me ? Reeves , ? " he said . When the game began , the joking ended , and Dan Reeves suffered in silence , as he ? d done every game day since 1941 , when he ? d bought the team . He paced nervously , far removed from his wife , Mary , the rest of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time to be jovial or even social . It was time for football . // Down on the field , the game sounded different , victim to the noiseless vacuum of severe cold . There was little kibitzing between the teams , and almost none of the concussive , amplified smack that so often accompanied the heavy hitting of professional football . The quality of play was still sharp , but on a day when the temperature was zero degrees at kickoff , the players felt the pain more than heard it , each tackle accompanied by heavy breathing and dull , muffled thuds . The crowd sounded different as well , its applause muted by layers of gloves , the cheers rising curt and thin in the icy air . // Even in the ? 40s , people argued about whether the pressure of football built character or revealed it . But Reeves had long ago learned how capricious the game could be , how random its deciding factors . On this frigid Sunday , he watched Sammy Baugh ? s pass from the Redskins ? end zone hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what was then an automatic safety . After Waterfield threw the first of two long touchdown passes for the Rams , his extra point attempt was partially blocked , with the ball careening toward the crossbar , hitting it , and dribbling weakly over . Baugh ? s freak safety and Waterfield ? s wounded conversion had been the difference in the 15-14 edge the Rams nursed into the fourth quarter . // By that time , the windows of the Cleveland Stadium press box had fogged over , and most of the writers covering the game had abandoned their typewriters and gone outside into the biting cold , cursing as they bundled up to face the brutal wind , but drawn to the finish of the frantic battle below . Reeves himself was outside when he saw the play that decided the game . With the Redskins nearing midfield in the closing minutes , running back Steve Bagarus made an end run to the right , then reversed field and broke free , running in a sweeping arc to the far sideline , with two Rams in hot pursuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waterfield ( who in addition to being the star quarterback was also the team ? s best defensive back ) , made a desperate lunge and extended his left arm before hitting the ground . The contact was scant  --  Waterfield ? s hand barely nicked the toe of Bagarus ? s trailing foot  --  but it was just enough to knock the runner off his feet and save a touchdown . The Rams ? defense stiffened from there and the Redskins missed a field goal attempt . // Moments later , the game was over and the Cleveland Rams were world champions . The hardiest fans stormed the field to tear down the goalposts in celebration , while the rest of the crowd headed for shelter and celebration into Cleveland ? s bars , restaurants , and dance halls . In the locker room , where the players massed for the traditional celebratory championship candid photograph , head coach Adam Walsh hugged his brother , Chile Walsh , and announced , " I knew you were champs back there at Bowling Green ! I knew it ! I knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his old college roommate at Notre Dame , with a hug and a handshake . Then Layden presented Reeves with the league ? s Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy , given annually to the NFL champion . " I ? ve been used to losing for so long , " said Reeves , with tears in his eyes , " that I wasn ? t counting on anything until it was all over . " // As Reeves returned with friends and family to his suite at the Clevelander Hotel , his jubilation was tempered by the private realization that his time in Cleveland was near its end . Reeves had lost more money in earlier years , but in the season in which his team had marched to the world championship , it still lost $64,000 . And the prospects for box office improvement were dim , since the rival All-America Football Conference would begin play the following season , with a franchise in Cleveland that seemed to be the strongest in the league . // Reeves had decided , win or lose , that when the NFL held its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his goal , stated for years in private sessions with the owners , to move his franchise to Los Angeles . This time , he was determined : Dan Reeves was heading west , or else Dan Reeves was leaving football . // By the end of World War II , the unique personality and character of the National Football League had begun to develop . The NFL owners comprised a particularly hidebound and tightly knit fraternity , loath to accept outsiders , reluctant to change the often circuitous , inefficient manner in which proceedings were conducted . Many could remember the league ? s earliest years , when it was perceived to be  --  and for the most part was  --  a haphazard assemblage of pickup games and hired hands making weekend pay . // The Bears ? legendary coach and owner George Halas had been there from the start , present at the creation of the league , one of sixteen men in Ralph Hay ? s Jordan and Hupmobile showroom in Canton , Ohio , in August 1920 . That meeting , called by the league ? s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what would be called the American Professional Football Association , and two years later renamed the National Football League , though it had no franchises west of Chicago or south of Washington , D.C. // Its next president , elected in 1921 , was the tireless Columbus promoter Joe F. Carr , who presided over the league ? s dark ages , in which thirty-five franchises folded in the league ? s first ten seasons . At that 1921 meeting , Halas moved the Decatur Staleys to Chicago , where a year later he renamed them the Bears , and the Green Bay Packers and Earl " Curly " Lambeau entered the league . Four years later , they were joined by New York bookmaker Tim Mara , who bought the New York Giants for $2,500 , reasoning that any franchise in New York City ought to be worth that much . // In 1932 and 1933 , the rest of the inner circle came on board . First there was George Preston Marshall , the bombastic Southern laundry man , who bought the Boston Redskins in 1932 , moving them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1933 , " Blue-Shirt Charlie " Bidwill , Chicago businessman and diehard Bears fan , bought the crosstown rival Chicago Cardinals , though those closest to him knew the Bears were still his favorite club . // Then there was Philadelphia ? s Bert Bell and Pittsburgh ? s Art Rooney , who ? d met at a horse track in the late ? 20s , and whose franchises joined the league in 1933 , the same year that the Pennsylvania state legislature relaxed its blue laws , allowing sporting events on Sundays . De Benneville " Bert " Bell , the son of a Pennsylvania attorney general , was a blueblood aristocrat with a common touch , who spent much of the ? 20s roaring his way through his inheritance . The raconteur Art Rooney , son of a corner tavern owner in Pittsburgh , was a delightfully egalitarian personality in his own right . Rooney ? s team was called the Pirates throughout the ? 30s , before changing its name to the Steelers in 1940. // For most of the ? 30s and ? 40s , these seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bidwill , Bell , and Rooney  --  were the National Football League . The ? 30s brought hard-earned growth , with liberalized passing rules , the introduction of a two-division system with an annual championship game ( Marshall ? s idea ) , and the first college draft ( the brainstorm of Bell ) , all introduced under Carr ? s watch . Through the decade , the game retained its slangy sense of barnstorming informality . Pittsburgh head coach Johnny Blood once missed a game because he simply forgot it was on the schedule . Most players fit practices during the week around their regular jobs , others came into town on the weekends , and played for less than $100 a game . // The tight band of owners fought like brothers , but persevered in the face of several rival start-ups , the indifference of much of the American sporting public , the condemnation of many in college football , and the failures of several of their partners . Those who remained were cautious , inherently suspicious of change , and not eager to test their horizons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggled through a season with the failing rival American Football League , called NFL president Joe Carr to apply for an expansion franchise in the NFL . Carr came to Cleveland , met owner Homer Marshman , and invited him to come to the next meeting to apply for membership . &lt; //
