Kirk from Los Angeles would appear to be just another typical MySpace denizen . His page reveals that he 's a Sagittarius , loves movies and wants to meet Angelina Jolie . Get in line , kid . <p> Or maybe not . <p> " I suppose I could just call her dad ( actor Jon Voight ) and set that up , " says Kirk Douglas , who faithfully updates his page once a week . " As long as my wife says it 's OK . " <p> At 92 , the screen icon is at the older end of the growing phenomenon that is social networking . But his decision to share opinions and Angelina-inspired desires with virtual strangers is echoed by the millions of Boomer-on-up Americans who have taken a teen staple and made it yet another weapon in their always-on communications arsenal . <p> Whether it 's congressmen Twittering during presidential speeches , parents connecting with high school flames on Facebook or empty-nesters planning group outings on grown-up sites such as Eons.com , Baby Boomers are speeding up the Web 's ongoing metamorphosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ networking is fast becoming a staple for a growing number of adults as Web use surges . One-third of adult Internet users have a profile on a social networking site , up from 8% in 2005 , according to the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project . And though adults share some teen habits  --  checking in with friends , planning get-togethers  --  they differ from the younger set in their desire to use the medium to meet new friends from across the country . <p> Their reasons for connecting with others online vary , but the passion for it is unwavering . <p> For Douglas , social networking affords him a literal voice  --  a stroke in 1996 left him with halting speech  --  as well as " instantaneous contact with people of all ages and opinions , which keeps me young . " <p> Retired software consultant Reed Nash , 52 , of Lunenburg , Mass. , says sharing his passion for NASCAR and barbecue with fellow devotees has " made me a lot of great new friends I otherwise would n't have . " <p> Kathy Carr , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , used to get her social fix while traveling for work . She has turned to social networking " to find other women who are raising teens , enjoying good careers and have something to say . " <p> Facebook , that social networking giant with 175 million users worldwide , was famously conceived for kids by a kid , Harvard undergrad student Mark Zuckerberg , now 24 . But what Boomers like , they devour . <p> " The last six months have been a turning point in terms of people going from not seeing a reason for social networking to fully embracing it , " says Lance Ulanoff , editor of PCMag.com . " The reason is simple : We 're able to get more real-time information about people we know and love . Social interaction as we know it is changing on the fly . " <p> And  --  OMG !  --  it 's not just shifting for the acronym-speak set . <p> Networking by the numbers <p> Sixteen-and-a-half million adults ages 55 and older engage in social networking , according to Internet monitoring site comScore . Facebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older . MySpace , with 130 million users , is enjoying a surge among the 55-plus set , who total 6.9 million users and spend an average 204 minutes a month on the site . And in just one year since AARP.org unveiled its social networking platform , about 350,000 users have created 1,700 groups for everything from gardening to social activism . <p> " Our members comfortably exist in both the real and virtual worlds , " says Nataki Clarke , director of online marketing at AARP . " Social networking may have started out as a way to check on kids and grandkids , but it 's now really all about your individual connections with peers . " <p> The desire to get in touch with like-minded souls is fueling the growth of sites such as Eons.com and TBD.com ( as in , the rest of your life is still " to be determined " ) , which attract those who do n't want to be " friended " by someone whose idea of a good conversation means a tweeted 140 characters or less . <p> " The Facebooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my page , my profile , my wall . We 're about ' we , about getting together in groups around mutual passions , " says Jeff Taylor , founder of Eons , whose 800,000 users bond over topics such as genealogy , elder care and technology . <p> One hallmark of sites such as Eons is their mission to lure new friends who share your interests , a direct contrast with a site such as Facebook , where you attract largely those you knew or know . <p> " My teenage daughter is online all the time , " Taylor says . " But when I asked her about wanting to meet new friends , she said , ' Dad , that 's disgusting . There 's the big difference . " <p> Boomers , by contrast , often embrace the notion of making new friends online , says Robin Wolaner , CEO of TBD.com , whose 120,000-user membership has been growing by 20% a month . <p> " By the time you 're 50 , you tend to know everyone you 're going to know . So if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to the same people you already know ? " she says . " We 're finding that these bad economic times are particularly good for social networking . <p> " Boomers are really affected by what 's going on , and they like not to be alone with their thoughts . " <p> So much so that some social networkers feel compelled to take their new friendships offline . A group of Eons.com friends recently went on a cruise to Alaska together , and around 50 TBD.com acquaintances are meeting in Kansas City later this month to share thoughts on spirituality . <p> Some Internet experts are particularly convinced that the future of social networking lies less in the realm of vacuous instant updates to friends ( " I 'm drinking a latte right now while online at an ATM " ) and more in the arena of like-minded groups gathering virtually to enjoy and comment on a specific event . <p> " I call these ' velvet-rope social networks , people who are connected in a context that matters to them all , like watching the Oscars together online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marketing Labs , which advises large corporations on how to market using social networking . " It 's going back to the idea of hitting the bar or pub to talk about something , a gathering place to share group moments . In a world where few people live close to family or old friends , the Internet can bridge that gap . " <p> Such gatherings could have implications that ripple through society , affecting everything from TV viewing habits to the way companies peddle products . <p> The old model " of an Ed McMahon-type guy pitching you something is long dead , because today people wo n't listen to TV ads , but they will listen to each other on these sites , " says Barton Goldenberg , president of Bethesda , Md. - based ISM , a social media consultancy . " It 's all being reversed now . Ads wo n't drive brand loyalty , people will . These sites are where Boomers share their opinions , and those in the corporate world are starting to realize that . " <p> Ever evolving <p> Time magazine tech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the inevitable advent of more sophisticated smart phones , which will allow sites such as Facebook , MySpace and Eons to be always on and mobile . " The great thing about social networking is it allowed you to take control of your identity online , so now you are who you say you are , " says Quittner , 50 . <p> But for all its potential power , social networking remains in its awkward infancy , offering up equal parts excitement ( hearing from that grade school sweetheart ) and weirdness ( what to do when your boss friends you ? ) . <p> Quittner concedes he runs hot and cold on the notion of living a life exposed to the digital masses . " Visiting some friends pages you often see things that are shocking . I guess it 's like a tattoo : a good idea at the time . " <p> For some users , it 's the " social " part that 's at issue . Dee Dee Taft , 41 , who runs Spin Communications in Mill Valley , Calif. , joined Facebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her firm . " When I started , it was exciting , but then I was getting friended by people I met once and people that I had purely business relationships with , and it made me wonder , ' What 's the definition of a friend ? " <p> On the upside , she has reconnected with a few long-lost friends . The downside ? Having CEO clients friending some of her twentysomething staffers , and getting messages from family members that hundreds of her Facebook friends can read . <p> " It 's almost voyeuristic . Everyone can see you and you can see them , " she says . " Sometimes , I feel like yelling , ' Just pick up the phone and call me ! " <p> But for the Rev. Rosa Lee Harden of San Francisco 's Holy Innocents Episcopal Church , such liabilities are worth the benefits of opening your life up to others online . Harden often Twitters to get ideas for a sermon and says her Facebook page has at times provoked " startlingly honest conversations " that might never happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Italy asked their flock to give up e-mail and other tech habits for Lent . For Harden , that notion is like trying to stop a rocket that has already launched . <p> " I want to connect with the people I work with and love , " she says . " If social networking makes it easier , or more likely , then I 'll take it any day . " How to connect and act your age <p> New to social networking and over 40 ? Time magazine tech columnist Josh Quittner , a Boomer who can Twitter and friend with the best of them , offers his advice : <p> It 's not Las Vegas : " Think twice before uploading that amusing photo of you wearing boxer shorts on your head , " Quittner says . " What happens on Facebook does not stay on Facebook . " <p> Do n't share the love : " When Vampire Poke Stick or another such wacky application asks you to invite all your friends , ignore it , " he says . " Frankly , you 're the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends are sick of getting spammed with stuff like this . " <p> Resist the spotlight : " Every now and then , maybe once in 14 months , it 's OK to start a group celebrating your first book of poetry or the opening of your photo exhibit , " he says . " But it 's better to have someone else do it for you , and best if you do n't do it at all . " <p> The world is reading : " Remember that when you post a comment on someone 's page , everyone can see it , " he says . " You might think this is obvious . The fellow who posted a love couplet to ' my steamy escargot did not . " <p> Get real : " They 're not really your friends .
