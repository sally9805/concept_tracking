North is north and south is south in this 19th century sea story that contended for Britain 's prestigious Booker Prize last year and came out in a U.S. paperback edition last month . The novel follows the voyage of the Sincerity , a smuggling vessel that takes on a party of highbrow landlubbers bound for the island of Tasmania . One of them , the Reverend Geoffrey Wilson , believes that the Garden of Eden is located on the island and seeks to prove this as part of a great effort to debunk modern scientific theories of geology and evolution . Also on board is Dr. Thomas Potter , another amateur philosopher with a strange pet theory . Potter is a systematic racist , out to classify and pigeonhole what he believes to be the world 's inferior strains of humankind . These men have a terrible surprise in store for them . Tasmania 's British colonists have been warring with the Aborigines , and the Sincerity is sailing unwittingly into the heart of darkness . The book is a thinking person 's shipboard yarn , morally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adventure . <P>  --  By Walter Kirn
