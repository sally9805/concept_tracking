A COUPLE years ago Rockets reserve forward Matt Bullard attended a party in downtown Houston at which the hosts had rented a Pop-A-Shot machine . Soon enough one of the guests , flush with liquid courage , challenged the 6 ' 10 " Bullard to a friendly round of the flick-the-wrist shooting game . Bad idea : Not only did Bullard beat the man  --  and all other comers for the rest of the night  --  but he also set a record on the contraption . " Hey , I 'm telling you , " Bullard says with the mock bravura of a heavyweight fighter , " there 's no way someone 's going to beat me at Pop-A-Shot. " // Not that this comes as a surprise , considering that Bullard has basically been playing 24-foot Pop-A-Shot throughout his NBA career . For 10 seasons , nine of them in Houston , he has been the gangly gunner camped out behind the three-point line with , as teammate Walt Williams puts it , " the clip that 's always loaded . " More than half of Bullard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday 's games he had made 44.8% of his 49 two-point tries and 41.0% of his 134 three-point tries this season . ( Not exactly a slasher or banger , Bullard had attempted all of eight free throws , and made seven . ) " Matt 's an example of a guy getting in the right place and perfecting his skill , " says Houston coach Rudy Tomjanovich . " He 's intelligent , he supports the system , and defenses have to honor him . " // Bullard , 33 , flashed a lot more game as a kid in West Des Moines , where his father , Charles , was a bureau chief for The Des Moines Register . Then came two knee operations at Iowa and two more early in his pro career . Clinging to the bottom of the Rockets ' roster in the early ' 90s , he focused on the one skill he 'd had since Mr. Fazio , his fifth-grade coach , showed him how to snap his wrist and follow through . " I 'm a shooter , that 's what I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year of a three-year , $5.8 million contract . " A lot of guys do n't get it . To stick around you have to figure out your strengths and limitations . " // Well aware of the latter  --  his defense is suspect , and he admits he has " no handle whatsoever "  --  Bullard has honed his jumper and even developed a second strength , inbounding , that has made him the Rockets ' equivalent of a long snapper . " One time I came into a game just to throw the ball in , " says Bullard . " I passed to Vernon Maxwell , he hit a shot at the buzzer to send it to OT , and I came out . I never even stepped on the court . " // It was also along the sideline that Bullard met his wife , Paula . While in the huddle during the second quarter of a January 1993 game , he locked eyes with an attractive blonde behind the bench . A smile led to a wave , then to sign language . " She flashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But right when she finished , Rudy put me in , so the whole quarter I was repeating the number over and over in my head . When the half ended , I sprinted into the locker room to write it down . " His memory did n't fail him . Matt and Paula have two children , Sara , 4 , and A.J. , 2. // The last two summers Bullard has served as a commentator for Houston Comets home games , and although Tomjanovich urges him to consider coaching when he retires , he plans to follow his dad into the media . For now , though , the Pop-A-Shot king is content with his current line of work . " All I do is shoot the ball , and I get paid millions to do it , " Bullard says . " Man , is this a great life or what ? "
