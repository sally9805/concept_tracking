All-digital music is bringing new convenience and fun , but record companies and other content ownners may yet spoil the party . Pop the new compact disc Celebrity by " N Sync into an ordinary CD player and get ready to start jamming to the latest tunes from the top boy band . // Put the same disc into a personal computer 's CD drive , CD-compatible DVD player , or CD-burner unit , and the result may be quite different : total silence . That 's because Zomba Records , the record label that publishes " N Sync 's disc , is using the release to test new techniques that prevent free trading of digital copies of songs on the Internet-and even stopping individuals from burning the CD . Sony Music is doing the same with its new Michael Jackson release , and other record labels are experimenting with ways to foil those who would copy music in any form . Such efforts could render some expensive audio equipment and DVD players useless , though record-label spokespeople generally disavow any intention to prevent copying for personal use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise of greater flexibility and choice for listeners , the record labels are fomenting a counter-revolution to protect copyrighted material , even if that degrades music quality or inconveniences users . Some of these labels are also creating online music sites that offer titles for sale , though competitors warn that these sites may lock out other outlets , thereby monopolizing online music distribution . The complaints have already brought scrutiny from government antitrust regulators . The Justice Department is investigating and has issued subpoenas to participants in the labels ' sites . In " N Sync 's case , Zomba released three different versions of the CD . A general European release wo n't play on a computer at all . Lesser copy protection was included on releases for the United States and the United Kingdom . Only the European release had even a cursory warning label , noting that the disc could not be played on personal computers . Tests by AudioWeek magazine found that all three versions behaved unpredictably . The European disc played on a Macintosh , but not on Windows computers or on one brand of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computers , but not in some CD burners . That 's an odd result since the music industry gets nothing from computer makers , but collects a royalty fee on every CD burner and every burner-compatible blank disc sold . Likewise , reports surfaced that the Michael Jackson CD from Sony suffered from degraded audio quality . Some of the anticopying systems , such as Sunncomm 's MediaCloq , prevent discs from being played at all on computer CD-ROMs and other nonstandard CD players . Other anticopying systems , like Macrovision 's SafeAudio , automatically introduce errors and static when a consumer tries to make a digital copy of a track on a protected CD . Many record companies , including Zomba , wo n't reveal which anticopying system they plan to use , though many are experimenting with these systems . Universal Music , largest of the record labels , plans to include an anticopying system on every CD it sells by the middle of next year , but wo n't say which one . Needless to say , this effort risks consumer backlash , though at present , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copying . Prospects for a solution that works for everyone are hindered by the significant difference in perspective between content owners and music users . For example , Larry Kenswil , president of Universal Music Group 's new business development unit e-Labs , says , " Every single piece of evidence points to the current downward trend in the music market as being related to CD burning . We need to allow consumers to make the convenience copies they need , but to stop the mass production of discs . " At present , though , it 's not clear how that will happen . Analysts are skeptical that the anticopying techniques will catch on or be of much use in stopping the M trade , which often depends on CDs as the source for the music . " CDs are so widespread throughout the world that it would take five years before you even made a dent in the existing base of discs out there , " says Mike Paxton , a media analyst with Cahners In-Stat Group . Cutting the Web Connection The driving force behind digital music , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online . Some 15 million people were downloading 70 million songs a month on Napster before the company lost its legal battle with the record labels earlier this year . Even if intellectual-property issues can be worked out , it could take years before commercial music sites on the Internet regain the ease of use and flexibility of Napster , analysts say . The record labels ' new services include MusicNet , backed by AOL Time Warner , BMG , and EMI ; and PressPlay backed by Sony Music and Vivendi Universal . They will offer tens of thousands of downloadable songs for a per-copy or monthly subscription fee . Consumers wo n't be able to do much with the songs except play them back on the PC where they were downloaded . The formats favored by the labels - Microsoft 's Windows Media Format and RealNetwork 's RealAudio  --  contain built-in restrictions that can block users from moving files onto portable M players or burning them to CDs . And although M files can be played on many types of digital-audio equipment , support for the other formats is fragmented . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to listen to music on their computers , leading to incompatibilities and confusion . Some music formats will not play on certain portable players , even if the data can be transferred . Napster wannabes , like Morpheus from MusicCity , have emerged to meet the demand for free file trading . The new services do n't keep a listing of all available songs on a central server the way Napster did , so they are better able to fend off lawsuits from the record industry . Still , the industry is trying to shut down these post-Napster sites . Many independent online services want to sell tunes that can be used on portable players or burned to a CD , but they ca n't offer much of anything without permission from the big five labels , which own the copyright to more than 80% of all songs . Unless antitrust regulators object , the labels may succeed in preventing consumers from getting many songs off their computers and onto CDs or portable players . MusicNet and PressPlay wo n't deliver an immediate answer to the millions of fans with portable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There just is no standard , secure way to make the music portable yet , " explains MusicNet strategic adviser Richard Wolpert . " To move off a secure platform to a nonsecure one defeats our entire security model . But we 're already working on a way to do it . Portability is the biggest feature we do n't have on day one . " Nor did either service launch with a way for consumers to bum music to compact discs-the other popular way to get digital songs off a PC and into more traditional music-listening devices . As a result , the services may be unable to meet consumer demand stoked by the Napster phenomenon . " If you 're keeping it tethered to the PC , you 're not addressing portability-and that 's what consumers want , " says Jupiter analyst Mark Mooradian . " If that does n't happen , the design of these services is effectively doomed to failure . " Mooradian predicts consumers will be slow to sign up for the new commercial services-letting free file trading continue to grow in popularity . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its competitors . Microsoft 's Windows Media Player , including the latest version built into the Windows XP operating system , can handle some popular formats . But Media Player ca n't play music in RealNetwork 's format , which is used for most live broadcasts on the Web . To make matters worse , MusicNet is starting off using the RealNetwork format ; PressPlay relies on Microsoft 's format . Other commercial sites use different formats , including Liquid Audio , an advanced audio-compression standard . At least Real Networks has licensed Microsoft 's format , so consumers using the company 's new RealOne player will be able to listen to songs recorded in Windows Media format . But officials at some of the pay services complain that Windows XP discourages people from playing music in Real 's player by making Microsoft 's player the default . " What they 're doing is trying to lock you into their company store , " says Real Network 's general manager of consumer products , Steve Banfield .

" You can choose the player ; you can choose the default , " says Michael Aldridge , product manager for Windows Digital Media division . " We ask you up front . " Getting Music In Every Room Digital music is most often created and downloaded on computers that reside in a study or home office , while the preferred way to listen to music is in the living room , kitchen , or bedroom . Portable M players help to bridge this gap at least partway , so digital-music files can travel to the gym or on the subway . But within the home , many music fans are stuck hunched over their keyboards , listening to digital-audio tracks while sitting close to their PCs , in " the two  --  foot experience , " according to John Spofford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions . Consumers would rather listen to music relaxing on a couch , across the room from their much more capable stereo system , he says . " Both approaches are valid at different times of day , but we need to bring the music to the living room , " Spofford says . Manufacturers like HP are trying to finally close the gap between PC audio and stereo systems with a new generation of products that are easier to use and compatible with a wide range of equipment . The offerings range from basic networking devices that keep files on a computer but allow playback on stereos , to more complex servers that connect directly to a stereo setup and store digital tracks on an internal hard drive . HP 's latest offering , the Digital Entertainment Center , includes a CD player that can also burn CDs and copy songs to the system 's huge hard drive . The Digital Entertainment Center is designed to sit with other stereo equipment , not next to the PC . There 's even an HP online service that offers music downloads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digital players , will sell a similar device , but has other ideas about getting music off the PC and into the living room . The company 's Rio Receiver connects to a stereo , then to a PC in another room using one of three simple networking techniques : The box can plug into phone lines , electric outlets , or wireless networks . The wireless links use the 802.11b standard , also known as WiFi . Market-research analyst Jon Peddie predicts that eventually such new products will merge . Then everything from satellite television receivers to VCRs to DVD players will reside in what 's almost an all-in  --  one player . " We 're in a transitory environment , " Peddie says . " Some of this is very technical , and some people will get stuck with boxes that do n't do what they want after a year . One day , it will all evolve into two or three major devices . " One might contain a hard drive for recording television shows , music , and Internet content , while another could control traditional stereo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV and cable or satellite systems . Incredible Disc Players Are Coming Despite the many forms of online music available , do n't count out audio CDs just yet . Most of the new digital-music services promise only " near-CD-quality " sound . That 's because the high rates of compression needed to make song files small enough to be downloaded and to fit on portable players causes some loss in fidelity . Makers of compact discs hope to keep their products popular by taking advantage of this limitation : They are moving in the opposite direction , producing new players that deliver even better sound than current models . Since compact discs replaced vinyl albums in the 1980s , researchers have been hard at work improving the capabilities of the lasers used to lay down CD tracks and to play them back on a stereo . As a result , far more information can be squeezed onto new disc varieties-yet these are no larger than CDs holding at most 80 minutes of music . This will yield significant improvements in sound quality , though at the familiar price of competing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DVD-audio and the Super Audio CD ( SACD ) will vie for space on the shelves of serious audiophiles this holiday season . Each format offers more room for digitally encoding music , giving the recordings a fuller dynamic range and a richer , fuller sound . Some say the new formats restore the warmth that was lost when analog vinyl records bit the dust . The extra capacity also lets recordings go beyond two stereo speakers , and take advantage of advanced home audio systems using five or more speakers . The new formats provide room for extra information , such as song titles or lyrics-which can be displayed by some stereo components and televisions . DVD-audio , an extension of the technology used to create popular DVD videos , is being incorporated into DVD players and should soon be available in models costing only a few hundred dollars . With many people entering the market to buy their first DVD video player , analysts think this format could spread quickly . But only about 1,000 DVD  --  audio music titles will be available by the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new high-end CD players , so the potential audience may grow more slowly . Limited numbers of titles will be available in either format this year , says Jay Berpagnolli , manager of audio merchandise for electronics giant Circuit City . The discs cost up to twice as much as ordinary CDs and are usually kept in a separate section to avoid confusion . " These formats will be significant niche products for audiophiles who want the best sound possible , " Berpagnolli says . Current players only read one format or the other , but eventually manufacturers will release players that can read both . This will let consumers avoid getting stuck with a useless box if one format triumphs , he says . Emerging compact-disc formats , online music services , and new portable players all point toward an exciting world of digital audio . But for now , consumers must shop carefully to find compatible products and avoid dead-end duds .
