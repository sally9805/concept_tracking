Mischief Night My name is A.J. and I hate school . Well , I have to tell the truth . There is one thing about school that I really love . Dismissal ! That 's when we get to go home ! " Do n't forget to wear your Halloween costumes tomorrow , " Mrs. Patty cackled over the loudspeaker just before the three o'clock bell rang . " Halloween is my favorite holiday ! " She 's not kidding . Mrs. Patty celebrates Halloween all year long . There are always cobwebs and spiders covering her desk . She wears earrings that look like little skeletons . And she always has candy in her office . Lots of candy . I like Mrs. Patty . She 's the secretary at Ella Mentry School . That means she sits in the front office all day and makes announcements over the loudspeaker . " Friday is pizza day ! " she will say . Or " Miss Lazar , please mop up the throw up in the vomitorium . " Or " Will the children who left their jackets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a school secretary is like being a DJ . That is a cool job . I grabbed a piece of candy and ran out the front door of Ella Mentry School with my friends Ryan and Michael . Free at last ! " What should we do for mischief night tonight ? " asked Ryan , who once ate a piece of the seat cushion on theschool bus . " Let 's T.P. somebody 's house , " said Michael , who never ties his shoes . " Yeah ! " I do n't know if you know this or not , but the night before Halloween is mischief night . That 's the night you go out and do mischief , so it has the perfect name . And T.P. stands for toilet paper . On mischief night you go out and throw toilet paper all over people 's trees . That 's the first rule of being a kid . " Whose house should we T.P. ? " I asked . " How about Miss Daisy 's house ? " Ryan suggested . ( Miss Daisy is our teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd get in big trouble . " " How about Mr. Klutz 's house ? " Ryan suggested . ( Mr. Klutz is our principal . ) " Nah , " Michael said , " we 'd get in even bigger trouble . " Speaking of trouble , guess who ran by us at that very moment ? It was the most annoying person in the history of the world , little Miss Perfect Andrea Young . She is in our class and has curly brown hair . She thinks she is so smart . " What 's the rush , Andrea ? " asked Ryan . " I have to finish my homework before ballet class , " Andrea said . " Why do n't you do your homework after ballet class ? " Michael asked . " After ballet class I have soccer and my cooking class . " Andrea takes classes in everything . If they gave a class in going to the bathroom , she would take that class so she could get better at it . I hate her . But seeing Andrea gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let 's T.P. Andrea 's house ! " I told the guys . " A.J. , you 're a genius ! " said Ryan . Continues ...
