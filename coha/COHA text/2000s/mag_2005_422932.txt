Start here 1 IS IT MY SPINE ANGLE ? " You want to tilt toward your right , not toward the target , " says Top 100 Teacher Martin Hall , of Ibis Golf and Country Club in West Palm Beach , Fla . " Tilting toward the target leads to a steep , outside-in backswing that leaves the clubface open at impact . " HOW TO CHECK " Place the head of a driver under your chin , hold the shaft against your body and take your address . If you 're tilting the wrong way , the butt will point to your right leg . " YES ! FIX No. 1 Using the same test , tilt your spine to the right until your driver points to your left leg . NO ? 2 IS MY LEFT FOOT FLARED TOO MUCH ? " If you overly flare your left foot , " says Hall , " that promotes early hip rotation in the downswing and delays squaring of the clubface . " HOW TO CHECK Picture this : You 're standing at home plate . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much flare . YES ! FIX No. 2 Simply close your left foot , making it perpendicular to the target line . NO ? 3 IS MY GRIP TOO WEAK ? A weak grip can equal weak push-slices , warns Hall  --  and it 's so common because a weak grip feels natural . HOW TO CHECK Place a tee between the thumb and index finger of both hands and address the ball . " The tees should point to the right of the shaft . If your grip is weak , they 'll YES ! FIX No. 3 Easy , says Hall . Just turn your hands to the right , so the tees aim to the right of the shaft . NO ? 4 IS IT MY TAKEAWAY ? " Do n't over-rotate your hands in an effort to get the club 's toe in the air , " Hall says . " That opens the face too early , and you ca n't recover coming down . " HOW TO CHECK Your left elbow turns skyward during the takeaway , instead of toward the ground . YES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Hall says . " As you take the club back , keep it " looking " at the ball as long as you can . That will quiet your hands . " NO ? 5 IS IT MY BACKSWING ? An open clubface at the top can lead to an open clubface at impact . HOW TO CHECK " Take your normal backswing and stop at the top , " says Hall . " If you can see all four knuckles of your left hands , that 's two knuckles too many . " FIX No. 5 " Turn the left hand at the top so you can only see two knuckles , of your index and middle fingers .
