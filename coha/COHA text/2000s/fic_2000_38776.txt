SOME PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS wanted to be President , ora baseball player , or a movie star , or business tycoon . Me , I 've always wanted to own a bar . Not some flaky franchised chicken-finger paradise for post-fraternity muscleboys and their bimbos ; a real shot-and-a-beer kind of neighborhood joint . Pool table or two in the back , an old Wurlitzer by the bathroom doors , a long mirror behind the bar suitable for the sort of **30;2076;TOOLONG scrutiny to which melancholy drunks love to subject themselves . Tables with a topography of cigarette burns , water rings , dents of uncertain origin , all preserved under a quarter-inch layer of varnish . Beer signs on the walls , no bikinis or volleyballs allowed , just painted mirrors and classic flickering neon like the sign out front that says FRANKS PLACE . Cab company numbers taped to the side of the phone . A blackboard leaning against the mirror advertising the day 's special and a permanent addendum : HANGOVERS FREE OF CHARGE . <p> An old neighborhood bar , like I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer and fewer people live in the old neighborhoods anymore and the ones who are left do n't talk to each other . Harder still to start one up , because any place that will support one already has one , but that 's a defeatist attitude as Susan would have said . A real go-getter can-do type of person , that was my wife . She died the day after my small-business loan was approved . Car wreck . She wanted me to have the bar , though ; ever since I 'd known her she 'd said I was born to be a bartender . How do people decide things like that ? <p> Did you know that more Americans die every year in car wrecks than were killed in Vietnam ? Or maybe it 's every two years . Nine months ago I would n't have known that , but tending bar fills you up with more useless trivia than you would think any one brain could hold . I know that the Ambassador Bridge in Detroit runs south to Windsor , Canada , and that Wally Pipp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Lou Gehrig . Bar bets . There is nothing so esoteric or irrelevant that someone wo n't bet a beer over it . <p> I spent Susan 's insurance policy on an antique Wurlitzer that plays real records . Limits my selection a bit , but the kind of crowd I draw has a certain collective taste and the guy who sold me the juke threw in about twelve hundred forty-fives that he 'd been collecting since 1956 . So I have Elvis and Patsy Cline , the Beatles and Marvin Gaye , Louis Armstrong and Johnny Cash , along with tons of stuff that I 've never even played . And I take requests , got a sign over the Wurlitzer , so I find myself sorting through those boxes of forty-fives looking for something that I 'm pretty sure I should have even though I 've never actually seen it . It was because of one of those requests that I struck up an acquaintance with Milt Chrzanowski . <p> A guy - not Milt - sat down at the bar once in the early evening not long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> I love people who order like that ; to a bartender , it 's an expression of trust . At least , I choose to look at it that way since the alternative is believing that people do n't care what they drink , and that concept is unsettling and foreign to people such as myself . This guy looked at first inspection like a local-brew sort ( not something I can explain ) , so I cracked open a Pike . After a second look , I set it down without a glass . <p> " Nice juke , " he said , finding the beer without looking at either it or me . He took a long swig , glanced at the label , and dug a twenty out of his shirt pocket . " What 's on it ? " <p> People always ask me that when they see it 's an antique , as if I 'm only going to have some sort of theme music . It annoys me . The guy got up and walked over to the box , standing slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he was taller than he 'd looked sitting down . He stayed that way for a long time . <p> There were eight or ten people in the place , Boeing workers and fishermen killing time until their boats went back out . Two or three trickled in every time one or two wandered out . I lost track of the guy as I filled orders and shot the shit with regulars about the Sonics ' postseason collapse and the continued influx of Californians into our fair city . Eventually my granola-punk waitress Donna came in and everything leveled off into an average Wednesday night . I was unloading the dishwasher when I looked up to see the tall guy back at the bar . He waggled his empty beer at me . As I set a fresh one in front of him ( I 'd guessed right about the glass ) , he dropped a five on the bar and walked off . <p> Donna sashayed up to the bar laden with empties . " You have n't even noticed my new tattoo , " she said petulantly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flinging bottle caps all over the floor behind the bar . I have a trash can by the coolers , but some nights my aim is off . <p> " Do tattoos change color when you get a sunburn ? " <p> The speaker was not the tall guy . He was a slight balding fortyish guy in a pinstripe suit that looked kind of crooked . Except for the suit he kind of resembled me . I looked around for Donna but she was gone , a faint odor of patchouli her only remnant . <p> " Du n no , " I said . " I never had one . " <p> " Neither have I , " he said . <p> " Fine place you have here , " he added , squinting into the narrow neck of his bottle . " The Wurlitzer is a lovely touch . " <p> He gave me a funny look when he said that , like he expected it to mean something more , or at least other , than just what he said . I 'm a bartender ; when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of <p> " You do n't recognize me , do you ? " he said , looking back into his bottle . I 've heard many a man swear that they saw God in the bottom of a beer bottle . Myself , I just usually feel Him pounding on my head the next morning . <p> " ' Fraid not . <p> " Ah well , " he said , motioning for another beer . " I guess you would n't , but those of us in invisible occupations occasionally pine for recognition . We are the offensive linemen of the commercial banking world , the midlevel functionaries . " <p> Lawyers and bankers , two kinds of people you never want to piss off . " I 'm sorry , ah , Mister ... " <p> " Chrzanowski . " <p> " Oh , yeah , " I nodded vigorously . " I remember talking to you now . " It was actually true . He had called to reassure me that the loan was not in danger because of Susan 's death . I had been worried because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I did as a local government reporter for the P-I , and I had quit my job to give the bar a go . So they could justifiably have worried about my ability to make the payments . But we had some money put away , and even after the funeral expenses and the Wurlitzer there was a bit of insurance money left over . I was a financially comfortable widower , at least as long as the bar broke even . " It 's Milt , right ? " <p> He brightened . " That 's right , Mr. Sutter , " he said , reaching for his wallet . <p> I shook my head . " On the house , Milt , as long as you never call me Mr. Sutter again . " I caught myself just as I began to slide into smarmybartender mode . " The name 's - " <p> " Frank , yes , I remember . " We shook hands , me self-consciously wiping my hand on a towel first . He peered into the full bottle , wrinkled his forehead as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that this space was occupied by a bar before you leased it , do n't you ? " <p> I nodded . " Yeah , they left it a mess , too , " I said . " Place was a dive . " <p> He nodded , wistfully I thought . " It was that , at least in its last few years . But in the years before that , it was a place not unlike this one ; not too rowdy , but not sanitized either . " <p> I was surprised that my taste in bars had anything in common with that of a mid-level bank manager . <p> " I used to stop in fairly frequently when I worked out of the branch near here , " Milt continued . " ' Ten years or more , until I transferred downtown in eighty-one , I came to this place to decompress after a busy day of climbing the corporate ladder . " He chuckled and shook his head . <p> " God , has it been seventeen years ? Ambition ; glad I 've given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great engine of commerce , " he said grandly , raising his bottle in a toast . <p> I returned the gesture with a dirty highball glass , and Milt fell silent as I filled Donna 's orders . I never did ask her about the sunburn thing . <p> " They had one of those , too , " he said suddenly . I looked up and he was gesturing at the juke with the now-nearly-empty bottle . " Splendid machines , those . Memories as pleasant as the music . " He drained the bottle , waved it at me . He was getting lit pretty fast , and the more he drank , the more English he sounded . Not an accent , but choices of words and emphasis . Something . <p> I set another beer in front of him . He clinked the neck of his empty against its replacement , a sardonic little fare-thee-well . " Have you ever heard of a folk duo called Five and Dime ? " he asked . <p> " Nope , " I said . " I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Well , you could n't really be expected to know them if you were n't a native , either . Are you ? " I shook my head ; I 'd grown up and gone to school in Michigan , then ended up in Seattle by way of Texas and Colorado . Susan had more to do with it than anything else . I 've always been a sun-worshipper , and there are winters here when I 'd willingly trade a week at the beach for melanoma . But love will make you do strange things . <p> " I did n't think so . Anyway , they were locals , students at the U-Dub . " This is a strange local colloquialism ; University of Washington , therefore U-W , therefore Yoo-Dub . " They never amounted to more than playing coffeehouses for tips , but they pooled all of their money once and recorded a single . It was ' Tangled Up in Blue/as Simon and Garfunkel might have done it while on a sodium pentothal IV drip . Godawful song . But it was backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've ever heard , a lovely ballad called ' Rossetti Song . " ' He raised a questioning eyebrow at me ; I shook my head again and looked at the clock . <p> Nearly ten . I cracked open my first of the night , cheating by only a few minutes . Since the accident , nostalgic people give me the jitters . <p> " ' Rossetti Song , " ' I said under my breath . The sound of the words out loud brought to mind ' Rosetta stone/ and it was in the grip of strange allusions that I went back to lean on the bar opposite Milt . <p> " The reason I ask all this , " he continued , " is that your predecessor had that song on his jukebox . I was wondering if perhaps you had n't acquired his collection as part of the lease or something . " <p> " No , I got the spinner and the records from an ad . ' Actually plays records ! ' the copy said , like it was walking on water , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an antique . Shit , it 's only two years older than I am . " <p> I paused to drink my beer , get something in my mouth before I started some maudlin rant . " Helluva collection came with it , though ; supposed to be twelve hundred , but I have n't counted . " <p> " Twelve hundred , " Milt repeated . He drummed his fingers on the bar for a moment , then added , " Did you get it around here ? " <p> " Jesus , Milt , " I said , rolling my eyes . " Yes , I 'll look for you . " " It 's called ' Rossetti Song . " ' <p> " I know . " <p> " Reminded me of the words ' Rosetta stone ' the first time I saw the title ; is n't that strange ? " <p> I drained my beer . Slowly . " You do n't say . " <p> " I do , and you know what else ? The word juke comes from Wolof , a West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wickedly . ' How about that ? " He knocked back the rest of his Pike . " Another , please ? " <p> I got one for him and another for myself , and it still was n't ten o'clock . <p> " Rosetta stone , " I said , sitting cross-legged on the attic floor of the home Susan and I had bought 4 s.c . Before Crash . Every event , every memory of mine was starting to orient itself around the accident , around the afternoon that I 'd come in the front door shouting " I got it ! I got it ! " and heard the phone ringing . I picked it up and the voice on the other side identified itself as one Maura Yee from Swedish Hospital downtown . I did n't get there in time to say goodbye . <p> And that was it , really ; I was a married newspaper columnist one day and the widowed proprietor of a drinking establishment the next . I was n't able to either mourn my wife or exult in the realization of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I trudged ahead in a sort of dazed equilibrium . No great epiphany , no sudden collapse ; just a bit more beer than was really good for me and an aching vacant spot that I tried to pretend was n't there . And every now and then I would wonder when I would begin to mourn , or stop mourning , or begin enjoying Frank 's Place , and by the time I got done thinking about it I did n't know what the hell was going on . And at that time it was nearly I A.C. , almost a whole year ; when did everything start up again ? <p> The streetlight across from my house flickered weakly , mortally wounded by neighborhood teenagers . In its sporadic pink-orange light I could just barely read the label of the forty-five that rested in my lap : FIVE AND DIME , it said at the top of the circular label , and on the bottom ROSSETTI SONG 3:47 . And running along the outside edge was the legend SPARE CHANGE RECORDS . I 'd never heard of the label @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two of them , as I discovered when I rooted out Susan 's Norton Anthologies from her undergraduate English courses . I flipped through the wrinkly translucent Norton paper and found Christina Rossetti , younger sister of Dante Gabriel . The first two poems were simply titled " Son &"; and I put the book down . It was four o'clock in the morning ; Milt would be happy and the poems could wait until tomorrow . I reached for my beer , remembered I 'd left it upstairs next to the boxes of records . The book lay open in front of me , and I suddenly registered that the handwriting between lines and in margins was Susan 's . Susan 's from twenty years before , when the only Frank she was interested in was Zappa . <p> " Yeah , well , he 's dead too , " I said , and stood up . I flipped the Five and Dime record over in my hands and laid it B-side-up on my ancient Garrand turntable . The soft crackle in the dim room as I laid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shiver ; it was a sound I loved , bringing a weight of anticipation that the tiny spark of a compact-disc laser can not match , and the few seconds of not-quite-silence that follow it always flood me with memories of songs , and memories of Susan . <p> I sat on the floor in front of the couch and picked up the book as the music began , a melancholy call-and-response between two guitars with a faintly Celtic flavor and a definite tinny **30;2108;TOOLONG edge . One guitar dropped into a steady chorded durn dadadada dum dadum and the first voice came in , a half-chanted lyric baritone : <p> I met my love and wooed her , overarched by cypress leaves She was so frail , her face so pale , I feared that soon I 'd grieve . My love proved stronger than my fear , and her fair hand I won Though we both knew her illness grew , our two lives we made one . <p> It was my wont to mourn her as we clasped our hands together To slowly walk and hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to caress her check ; my touch bespoke my fear " But I still live ! " she 'd say , and give this song to stop my tears : <p> And now the second voice ( was it Dime or Five , I wondered ? ) took over from the first , a sprightly tenor dancing a cappella except for a double knock on the guitars at the end of every phrase : <p> When I am dead , my dearest , sing no sad songs for me ; <p> Plant thou no roses at my head , nor shady cypress tree : <p> Be the green grass above me with showers and dewdrops wet ; <p> And if thou wilt , remember , and if thou wilt , forget . <p> I shall not see the shadows , I shall not feel the rain ; <p> I shall not hear the nightingale sing on , as if in pain : <p> And dreaming through the twilight that doth not rise nor set , <p> Haply I may remember , and haply may forget . <p> At the second line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rossetti 's Norton entry . I followed along as that lovely tenor embraced her words and then soared into wordless arpeggiated harmonizing as the baritone and guitar leapt back in : <p> One day she lay and could not sing , nor raise her lips to mine <p> Her breath was stilled , hard sorrow spilled my love upon her dying . <p> I laid no roses at her head , nor sang a dirge to mourn <p> An oath I swore , to nevermore love any woman born . <p> She was my Lady of Shalott , my belle dame sans merci , <p> And when she died , I only cried to keep her memory . <p> I walk the grass above her now , and every shady tree <p> With her voice rings ; I know she sings , and know she welcomes me . <p> I sat very still , Susan 's handwriting in the margins of the blocky book wavering in my teary gaze . There was apop from the speakers as the needle kicked off the end of the runout groove , and a tear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Song . " <p> Expressions of mourning , it said . Dead do n't remember us , why should we them ? <p> The tear sat trembling in an auroral ring of dissolved black ink , smudging the word do n't . I started to close the book . There was a touch on the back of my left hand , a familiar brushing across the backs of my fingers that started a quivering in my stomach as it paused briefly over the still-pale stripe on my ring finger . Then it was gone , and I was left alone in my house an hour before dawn , my only company the ticking of the runout groove and the crushing realization that she really was n't ever coming back . <p> MILT DID N'T SHOW UP until the next Wednesday . I spent the week staring at the Five and Dime record peeking out from where I 'd stashed it behind the cash register . I suppose I was convinced that if I stared at it long enough I would figure out whether what had happened was real . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away and asked me if I 'd been to Vegas and what was her name ; after an inexplicable crippling wave of embarrassment , I threw a washcloth at her and went to open the doors . I mopped the floors , got deliveries , sparred with Donna , called cabs for laid-off Boeing riveters , and not once did I find myself suddenly destroyed by remembering that my wife was dead . Well , I found myself thinking at irregular intervals , I guess I went and got over it . The words would n't attach themselves to an emotion . <p> When I turned around from the register and saw Milt there , the first thing I noticed was that it was nearly twelve , much later than it had been the first time he came in . He was wearing the same crooked suit , wet from the misting rain . I wondered if he wore it every Wednesday . He was the kind of guy who might have a schedule like that . <p> " Whatever it was I was having last week , Ill have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could remember . I reasoned that if I could n't , he could n't either , and cracked him a Pike . " So - " he said , and I cut him off . <p> " Got it , " I said , pulling the disc out from behind the register . I returned to the bar and spun it on the polished wood in front of him . " It 's been here a week , waiting for you to come back . " <p> Milt seemed afraid to touch the record , afraid even to get near the comer of its plain paper sleeve that pointed at him . " That is n't funny , " he said . <p> It happened to him , too , I thought , although what exactly I meant by it I was n't sure . I looked at the clock again , suddenly in a huffy to chase everyone out and close up ; I did n't want to play the song with people around . If whatever had happened in my living room happened again , the whole bar would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thirtyyear-old garage-folk ballad . <p> A scan of the premises revealed only three bodies not in my employ , and one of those was Milt . The other two were down to the lukewarm dregs of a pitcher of Budweiser and showed no great promise of finishing it . " Call you a cab , fellas ? " I asked , hardly raising my voice over Patsy Cline singing " I Fall to Pieces . " The pair squinted up at me , then stubbed out cigarettes and rose to leave . <p> Donna had already put most of the chairs up . I called her over . " You can go early if you want , " I said . " I 'm coming in tomorrow morning anyway . " <p> She shook her head . " Rent 's going up . I need the hours . " <p> " What , it 's Wednesday ; you 'd be gone by one anyway - never mind , I 'll pay you until two . just go . Deal ? " <p> She looked quizzically at Milt , then back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on , Frank . " <p> After she left , I turned out the neon signs in the windows and the hanging lights over the pool tables . Streetlights cast spiny shadows of chair legs on the floor , made wavy by the rain and crosshatched by the sharper shadows cast by the single light behind the bar . Across the street was a vacant factory building , most of its windows broken out , graffiti covering the padlocked doors and grimy brick walls . it was raining like hell . <p> I wondered if my place was going to turn into a sleazy dive the way my predecessor 's had ; I was on the edge of a vacant part of the city . But who knew ? I was also on the edge of a perfectly healthy retail area , and in six months Frank 's Place could be surrounded by a completely new trendy zone . Fashion was too capricious to be outguessed . <p> Milt was still staring at the record as if it were a booby-trapped memory . I walked by him and picked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled the juke away from the wall and opened its case , removing the Supremes and dropping Five and Dime in their place . Milt had n't moved ; he was looking at me out of the comer of his eye and gripping his beer in two hands . <p> I dropped the canopy back into place and was pushing the Wurlitzer back against the wall when Milt said , " It 's happened to you too , has n't it ? " <p> I stood slowly up and wiped my palms carefully on my towel until I was sure I could speak without making a fool of myself . " What exactly do you mean by ' it ' ? " <p> " Come on , Frank , you kick everyone out as soon as I get here , send your waitress - who obviously thinks I 'm some sort of rough trade home early , and you 're wearing your wedding ring again . I had n't noticed that until she brought it up , but I 'd bet the contents of my branch safe that you played the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me greedily , practically begging me to admit to something . I wondered what he saw when the song was played . Or thought he saw ; maybe I 'd just been drunk and feeling guilty . <p> I dug a quarter out of my pocket . " Why is this song so important to you , Milt ? " I asked . <p> He hesitated , but only for a second . " Because my wife died here while it was playing . " <p> I was looking at the selection cards , and I saw number 126 , " Baby Love " by the Supremes , but my hand would n't quite move to put the quarter in the slot . " I remember humming along with the tenor over the melody line , " Milt went on , " and right at the words ' raise her lips to mine ' she put a hand to her temple and just pitched over out of her seat . Her name was Petra and she would have been forty-six this September . " He said all of this as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale of woe . I saw that he still wore his wedding band as he pointed to a window table and said , " Right there , under the Mount Rainier sign . That 's where it happened . " <p> Milt slid off his stool and walked toward the front table , still pointing . " And now when I hear that song in this place , I can see her , " he said , his voice beginning to tremble . <p> His arm fell back to his side as he approached the table and stood in front of it . " After I was transferred downtown , I found a copy of the song and took it home thinking that whenever I needed her I could play it there . But it did n't work , " he choked , and I could see tears shining in the odd pink glare of the streetlights . " It did n't work , and then this place closed and it was years , years before you came along . " <p> Milt paused , his fingers tracing the surface of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmer . " And when your wife died I was terribly afraid that you would refuse the loan and the space would remain vacant for longer than I could stand . A midlife crisis is difficult enough without the added complication of a dead wife you ca n't talk to , ba ha . So even though I had no idea what you would do with the space , I had to make sure your loan was n't recalled . And after you actually had the place open , I came in just sort of - quixotic , you know , and saw the jukebox ... " He shrugged miserably and produced a handkerchief . <p> I caught myself punching buttons and realized that I 'd put the quarter into the jukebox . The selector arm reached up and plucked the Five and Dime single from the row and laid it on the turntable , and the sad , searching guitars began their once-upon-a-time . <p> The colors in the Wurlitzer 's bubble-glass began to dance , and I could feel gentle vibrations in the palms of my hands as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , then pull out one chair and stand behind it . He smiled and went around to the other chair , sat down and leaned forward , spoke quietly and reached out , his hand moving like he was brushing his thumb lightly across invisible fingers . He stayed like that , smiling and talking , his eyes alight , and once I swear he laughed out loud and I could n't hear it . <p> And I felt nothing . <p> The song ended , and Milt looked down and shrugged , then lifted his hand in a halfhearted wave . He looked up at me like a man beatified a long time after death . <p> I stalked across the room and flipped the door key onto his table . " Lock up when you leave , " I said harshly , and charged out into the storm . <p> " You have n't slept , " Milt chided , looking me up and down from the other side of my screen door the next morning . <p> " Your goddamn pounding on the door woke me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifted nervously from foot to foot . <p> " The key , " he said , almost as if reminding himself , and he lifted it wrapped in a handkerchief from his breast pocket . " I left the two dollars for the beer next to the register . " <p> " Oh , for Christ 's sake , " I said , snatching the key from him . We stood there for a moment not looking at each other . " Well - " he said , but I cut him off . <p> " You had coffee ? " <p> " Well , no , " he said . " Is that an invitation ? I ' <p> Neither one of us spoke again until I 'd gotten coffee and we 'd both had the first scalding sip . Then the silence seemed more companionable , and finally Milt said , " You can tell they 're not English , ca n't you ? " <p> " What ? " <p> " Five and Dime . Whatever their real names were . Are . I mean , heather and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each other , I do n't think . " <p> " What 's your point , Milt ? " <p> " No point . It was an icebreaker . Another middle-management skill . " He sipped at his coffee . " As was accepting this coffee . It gives us a chance to talk . Communication is the first step toward a solution of any problem . " <p> " How come I did n't feel anything last night ? " I asked . I have no middle-management skills . <p> " Why do you expect me to know ? " Milt answered . " Goddammit , Milt . Answer the question . " <p> He paused , and then spoke carefully . " There is a difference , " he said , " between mourning and nostalgia . That 's as simply as I can put it . And some people make the transition from one to the other invisibly , over a period of time . Invisibly . Ha . That 's me , " he said bitterly . <p> Then he shook it off and continued . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You felt something the first time you played the song ? " I nodded . " And where was this ? " <p> " In my living room . " <p> . " But Susan did n't die there , did she ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Well . " He rubbed at one eye . " Hm . There 's an old saying , ancient really , to the effect that magic only works on those who believe in it . Now I do n't necessarily believe that 's true , but I do think - how to put this that there are some things that can be used in unusual ways given the proper circumstances . Which would n't arise unless the person was aware of the object 's capability , so there you have your ' magic only works ' canard . And I suppose this record , or this son &; is one of those things . What 's it about , after all ? Getting past mourning . Are you through mourning your wife ? " <p> I thought about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited for the squeeze in my chest , the anger , the rotten ache of loss . It did n't come . In its place was a memory , almost a waking dream , an image of the way her fingers used to brush across the backs of mine and linger for a moment on my wedding band , like Piglet saying I just wanted to be sure of you . And then it was gone . <p> I found that my throat was tight , but I was smiling . 1 " T is better to have loved and lost , right ? " I said . " There 's a canard for you . " <p> " That 's what I thought , " Milt said . <p> DONNA GOT USED to it , I guess , but she always gave me an odd took when I let Milt stay past closing on Wednesday nights.1 let it go ; after all , it was n't something that could be easily explained . Milt and I evolved our own set of rituals attendant only on Wednesdays : he brought a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the register . Usually when I came in the next morning , there were a few empties on the bar and a sawbuck on the register , and in return Milt drank free whenever I was there . It was a peculiar arrangement and it proved satisfactory for both of us , if not for Donna . <p> And after a dozen Wednesdays , I took a detour on the way home after leaving Milt to his visit . I sat with a six-pack on a park bench facing the Sound and drank slowly until I had to turn around to watch the sun came up . The colors of the dawn take on a certain enduring splendor when you 've stayed up all night to see them , as if you 've ridden the underworld , been swallowed by the wolf and come out the other side . And the sun , oh , the sun , leaping huge and molten from the Cascades and waxing into its full blinding brightness as the city began to wake up around me . I drove home accompanied by foreknowledge of nostalgia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sun a pale smudge . I spent the day running errands . The evening at the bar passed pretty much like it always did , and Milt showed up at quarter to twelve like he always did . <p> I stopped Donna before she could escape and handed her an envelope . " Do n't read it before you get home , " I said . <p> She shook her head and said , " Nothing you do surprises me anymore . " I held the door for her as she left , thinking Yeah . We 'll see . <p> Milt and I did n't usually talk on Wednesday nights , him being incoherent with anticipation and me likewise with exhaustion , but tonight I went over to his table after I 'd shut everything down and said , " I put the key in an envelope tonight . " <p> He looked at me quizzically . I 'm the worst liar in the world , and I know my face was giving something away , but all he did was nod , God bless him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raining and I whistled all the way to my car . Then I whistled all the way home , and then I went through the list one more time . Accountant ; check . Realtor ; check . City clerk ; check . Bank account ; check . <p> Loan officer . " Check , " I said , and laughed out loud . <p> I thought about it as I hummed down 1-90 past the suburbs and the outlying communities and up into the mountain towns . Thought about the progression from mourning to nostalgia , and moments of epiphany . Invisible , ha , that 's me , Milt had said , but what he had n't figured out is that he did n't want it any other way . He 'd opted out , settled into a comfortable mid-level job , saved my loan after Susan 's death , done everything he could to keep everything the same . Or not even that ; he 'd gone back , recreated a previous sameness . Petra keeps coming to him because he wants her to . <p> And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead do remember us , and they do want to be mourned , and they will keep coming as long as we keep wanting to go to them . That was n't what I wanted anymore . <p> Frank 's Place was a huge temple to Susan 's memory , an everlasting flame hoping to draw her like an ectoplasmic moth . I threw everything I had into it after she died because it was her dream for me as well as my dream for myself . it took more than a year before I figured out that dreams you dream with someone die with them . Frank 's Place was a dead woman 's dream kept alive by the living . <p> And I could n't keep it alive any longer , but Milt Chrzanowski could . He was on that invisible slow climb , that vision-dulling trudge through the bleak underground of loss and inadequacy and abandoned anger , and Frank 's Place had been his dream for a dead woman before anyone had dreamed it for me . <p> Or maybe that 's all bullshit . But Milt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accountant too . I do n't think I want to read it just yet . I do hope Donna still works there , and I told her so in the letter I gave her that last night . There was a check in that envelope too , in case she thought she could n't work for Milt , but my accountant says she has n't cashed it . So things are probably just going along there like they always were . Maybe Milt quit at the bank to take on the barkeep 's life that was dreamed for him . Maybe not . I imagine I 'll find out whenever I read his letter . <p> Meanwhile , the check from the realtor came , and due to the robust nature of the Seattle housing market I can afford to drive myself a bit further down this road or that , looking for a little sun to worship and a new , living dream instead of a monument to loss . I 'm leaving the sad songs to Milt . Let him hear the nightingale . And let him rendezvous with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . <p> And if I will , forget . <p> Author Affiliation
