Introduction // ON AUGUST 16 , 1977 , when I learned that the King-Elvis Presley-was dead , I was vacationing in Nova Scotia . In the lounge at the inn where I was staying , the news came on TV . Stunned , I could only mumble some clich ? s . The bartender recalled the death of the actor Audie Murphy , a war hero of his generation . I felt far from home . Although I had n't thought much about Elvis lately , I now sensed there was a great hole in the American cultural landscape . Elvis had always been there , hovering in the national psyche , his life punctuating our times-his appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show , his first movie , the death of his mother , the Army , his marriage , the 1968 " Comeback Special . " It seemed inconceivable that Elvis-just forty-two years old-was gone . // For me , Elvis is personal-as a Southerner and something of a neighbor . I heard Elvis from the very beginning on the Memphis radio stations . Many parents found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestive-but when my family saw Elvis on The Ed Sullivan Show , singing " Ready Teddy , " my father cried , " Boy , he 's good ! " We had been listening to rhythm-and-blues late at night on the radio for years , and we immediately recognized what Elvis was about . We had heard Arthur " Big Boy " Crudup and Little Junior Parker and Big Bill Broonzy and Wynonie Harris and Elmore James . In the daytime we listened to big bands , pop hits , country , the opera , everything we could find on the dial . On Sundays we sang in church along with the congregation , and we heard plenty of gospel music-especially the Blackwood Brothers , who influenced Elvis so much . Elvis listened to the same regional stew , seasoned by the far-ranging reach of the radio , so when he emerged with his own startling , idiosyncratic singing style , we recognized its sources . // Elvis was great , so familiar-and he was ours ! I do n't remember the controversy he stirred up because everything he did seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , a country person who spoke our language . It was hard to grasp how revolutionary his music was to the rest of the world . And it was years before we could realize what a true revolution in American culture Elvis had ignited . // But now the King was dead . Two writer friends of mine dropped everything when they heard the news and rushed to Graceland , Elvis 's Memphis home , to grieve with the multitudes of fans . One of the writers snitched a rose from a floral wreath and still has it displayed under glass on her wall . The other helped himself to the newspaper that had arrived at Graceland the day after Elvis died-the paper Elvis would have read if he had lived . Elvis , who was taken seriously in a wide variety of circles , inspired such a need for connection . He mattered deeply to many different kinds of people . After his death , the world absorbed the story-the utter loneliness of his life , his grasping for ways to ease his pain and sorrow . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the grief gave way to a nervous national joke throughout the eighties . Elvis had been part of American life , and now it seemed people did n't quite know what to do about him . Elvis was ridiculed , reduced to a caricature in a sequined jumpsuit . In 1992 , the post office held a contest to vote on the new Elvis stamp ; we could choose between the young , pretty Elvis and the older , bejeweled Elvis . Of course we chose the pretty one . // Some people refused to accept the news of his death . Sightings were reported . He became a barometer of the culture , a sort of hillbilly voodoo doll . As in life , Elvis was both revered and reviled . In 1980 , a scurrilous biography portrayed him as a redneck with savage appetites and perverted mentality , and of no musical significance to American culture . This character assassination undoubtedly helped promote the national joke . Many may have found it preferable to reduce Elvis to a symbol , because Elvis made them uncomfortable . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature from the lower classes ; for others , he represented innocence , and the destruction of innocence is an unbearable sight . Perhaps joking about him-transmogrifying him into a fat , drug-crazed hillbilly with gargantuan appetites-both alleviated the guilt and conveniently removed him as a subject for serious examination . But the nineties produced a steady stream of reconsiderations of Elvis . Peter Guralnick 's thorough two-volume biography helped to rescue Elvis 's reputation and restore an understanding of his music . Guralnick sympathetically portrayed a life that he called an American tragedy . // A few months after Elvis died , I visited the small two-room house in Tupelo , Mississippi , where he was born . It was now a museum , outfitted as it might have been when the Presleys lived there . It was furnished with flea-market antiques-Jesus figurines and heart-shaped pincushions , a washtub , a washboard , a pie safe , a kerosene lamp , and dishes that had come free in detergent boxes during the Depression . But what mesmerized me was the glitter poster-glitter spilled on felt paper , forming the shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seen one of those since childhood . I remembered them from church . The poster evoked a powerful memory-this fake relic , this reminder of the innocent , religious rock-and-roll artist who became a superstar like the world had never seen before . In the glitter you could imagine the foreshadowing of the sequined jumpsuit . The glitter poster , once ubiquitous in the South , was a little bit of fancy in a drab world . And it embodied immense hope . // Marvel // ELVIS PRESLEY seemed to have sprung on the world without a history . His emergence in the mid-fifties was so sudden , his music so fresh , his personality so evocative that he could not be labeled . People went crazy . There has never been a mania quite like it . Teenagers went wild with excitement ; their parents went wild with anxiety over Elvis 's overt sexuality . Girls ripped his car apart ; they stripped his clothes off ; they were ready to rock and roll . Elvis 's celebrity was an amazing American phenomenon , and the entire nation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first found Elvis so shocking he declared he " would n't touch him with a ten-foot pole . " Outside the South , the public found him frighteningly uncouth-a redneck from a backward , bigoted region . His music clearly had an affinity with rhythm-and-blues , from black culture . People heard raw jungle rhythms in his music-voodoo doings. // On the other hand , Elvis swept up marginal groups of people with a promise of freedom , release , redemption ; he embodied a yin and yang of yearnings ; he took people close to the edge and brought them back again ; with his stupendous singing talent , he blended all the strains of popular American music into one rebellious voice ; like Walt Whitman , he was large-he contained multitudes ; he created a style of being that was so distinctive it could be made into an icon ; he violated taboos against personal expression and physicality ; he opened the airwaves to risk and trembling . Rock-and-roll had been brewing for years , but its defining moment was Elvis . // Even though he was controversial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the years he became entrenched in American culture . He had eighteen number-one hits in a row ; his album of million-selling gold records itself sold a million records ; fifty-four million people watched his first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show , an 82.6 percent share of the nation 's viewing audience . In 1956 , the year he became known nationally , he became a millionaire , with ten songs on Billboard ' s Top 100 , more than any other artist in the past . His ascendance from regional star to national star to Hollywood all occurred in an eyeblink . He was a boy wonder , both endearing and threatening , with a talent that defied category . Elvis set in motion a style of music that would dominate the world for the rest of the century . It was the beginning of youth culture-kids got their own record players and radios . It was the breakdown of sexual inhibition , and the end of racial segregation . // Elvis 's success-and the rock-and-roll revolution-punctured the balloon of 1950s serenity and conformity . America was sunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviets and H-bombs , the nation at large seemed desperate for sweet contentment . But race issues were on the boil . The Supreme Court had ruled against segregation in Brown v. Board of Education only a few weeks before Elvis made his first record in 1954 . The time was right for a magical figure to burst forth like a natural symbol of integration . Black musicians praised Elvis for helping their own music to reach a commercial audience . Little Richard , the inimitable purveyor of " Tutti Frutti , " said , " I thank God for Elvis Presley . I thank the Lord for sending Elvis to open the door so I could walk down the road , you understand ? " // Later , Black Panther leader Eldridge Cleaver , in Soul on Ice , credited Elvis with sparking the social revolution of the sixties . Presley " dared to do in the light of day what America had long been doing in the sneak thief anonymity of night-consorted on a human level with the blacks . " // Popular music began to challenge conventional tastes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " Whole Lotta Shakin ' Goin ' On " and Buddy Holly 's " That 'll Be the Day " - began to dominate the charts . Because of his suggestive movements onstage , Elvis was called " Elvis the Pelvis , " a name that embarrassed him . He was excoriated for lewdness and lasciviousness . One headline called him the " self-winding singer . " His hip-swiveling was denounced far and wide , but he professed innocence . He did n't mean anything dirty by it , he said . It was just natural to him to let loose and express what he felt . With his coy lip curl and his playful habit of interrupting his songs to mug or joke , he reminded us not to take him too seriously . Elvis always had a sense of humor about his persona , acknowledging the absurdity of his fame . // Still , the weight of it affected his performance : his behavior was self-conscious , self-deprecating . Every person who achieves any degree of fame experiences some disorientation , but for Elvis it was unique . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such great success and fame so suddenly , with such far-reaching consequence and with so little preparation for dealing with it . This is a startling thought . How did he bear the burden ? // In wondering whether anyone else has ever experienced this sort of sudden global recognition , I can think only of the astronauts walking on the moon . Over two billion people saw the first moon landing . Nearly as many-one and a half billion-saw Elvis in the first satellite-beamed TV show , Aloha from Hawaii , in 1973. // Elvis 's fame happened to him-not entirely unbidden , but in proportions he had not imagined or sought . He was a dreamer , aspiring to stardom . He wanted to be big . He had seen all the movies , heard the songs , knew where the rewards came from-Hollywood and New York , not Memphis or Tupelo . But his desires outweighed his confidence . And his fame socked him in the face . It was as though Elvis himself had made one giant leap and then the whole earth jumped on him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brace drill . // The test of the popular hero in our age is his struggle against fame . The personal story of Elvis is his private tussle with his public image as the King of Rock-and-Roll . His tragedy arises from the earnestness of his endeavor to be the superhero he believed he was supposed to be . //  --  from Elvis Presley : A Penguin Lives Biography by Bobbie Ann Mason ,
