Prevention is the new watchword , and our annual health issue looks at how to avoid illness rather than just treat it . It costs a lot more to fix something that 's broken than it does to prevent it from breaking down in the first place . Our ailing health-care system is long past the point at which we can stop it from breaking down , and it will cost hundreds of billions of dollars to fix . But I trust it 's different for most of us . When it comes to individual health care , the model these days is not treating illness but preventing it . The prescription is prevention . Three-quarters of our health-care costs are attributable to chronic , preventable diseases . The way to avoid them ( as well as expensive treatments ) is to eat well , exercise , get checkups , vaccinate your kids and mind your mental state . That will help you -- and help the health-care system as a whole . TIME 's annual health issue takes a close look at the prevention philosophy at work -- and we focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff writer Alice Park explains , is not just for the patients but for its employees as well . The 40,000 people who work at the clinic and its 10 affiliated hospitals are offered diet and cooking classes , exercise instruction and smoking-cessation programs , all free of charge . This results not only in healthier employees but also in lower health-care costs and fewer days lost to sickness . What works for the Cleveland Clinic could and should be a model for other hospitals as well as for other companies and the entire nation . Elsewhere in the issue , Kate Pickert reports on the growing trend of seeing your health-care provider where you do your shopping . Supermarkets , pharmacies and even big-box stores like Wal-Mart are including freestanding clinics where you can drop in without an appointment to get a sore throat checked or a child 's earache treated -- all for as little as $60 a visit . Making health-care cheap , easy and available like this prevents small problems from getting big . Be sure to also read John Cloud 's story about how we can head off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distress . We tend to think of psychiatric problems as either being genetic or occurring for unknown reasons , but Cloud 's story shows that even illnesses like schizophrenia that have genetic origins can be stopped or contained before they start . The health package was ably edited by Jeffrey Kluger and Sora Song and designed by Cindy Hoffman and Patricia Hwang . This is a double issue , and there 's much more in addition to our health coverage .
