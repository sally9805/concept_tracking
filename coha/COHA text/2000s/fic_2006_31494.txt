OVERTURE CRUCIBLE In an instant , he saw how she would die . As soon as Leonard McCoy pulled open one of the double doors at the front of the mission and stepped out into the cool , damp night , his gaze fell upon the figure of Edith Keeler approaching from across the street . A long dark cloak wrapped her slender frame , and a pale blue cloche crowned her short brunette locks . Street lamps painted the scene with a dim glow , their light reflected here and there in the puddles earlier left behind by an evening rain . McCoy smiled at Keeler , but although her gait carried her directly toward him , she seemed to take no notice of his presence . Her static features betrayed a person lost in her own thoughts . Movement and a rumble off to the left caught McCoy 's attention . He saw a large , squarish ground vehicle barreling down the wet macadam . McCoy jerked his head back toward Keeler and spied the portrait of inner focus still drawn on her face . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the throaty plaint of its engine . In just seconds , she would march into its path . In that moment , a surge ofadrenaline overcame McCoy 's grogginess , and his surroundings suddenly became real to him . What he had in his cordrazine-induced madness believed some sort of deception or illusion , what he had later attributed to dementia or hallucination brought on by his accidental overdose , he all at once understood to be none of those things . Somehow , as he watched Edith Keeler walking into jeopardy , all of the explanations and rationalizations for his unusual circumstances dissolved like dreams upon waking . As McCoy started to move , he called to her  --  " Miss Keeler ! "  --  but even that did not penetrate her concentration . He took one step , then another , but his reactions seemed sluggish , his torpor doubtless a result of the powerful chemical still not entirely purged from his body . Even as he jumped the curb and into the street , his legs felt as though they were pushing through molasses . He knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still he moved . Three more running strides , and McCoy himself raced into harm 's way . He heard the vehicle as it bore down on him , the mechanical growl of its engine now thunderous in his ears . Just before he lunged forward , the sound of brakes keened through the metropolitan night , and he saw Keeler 's expression change , the woman at last startled out of her reverie . McCoy left his feet , his arms outstretched , attempting to reach Keeler even as the vehicle skidded forward , its wheels scraping noisily along the rain-dampened pavement . He struck Keeler solidly at her waist . His momentum stopped her in midstride , and she tumbled backward , her arms flailing as she fell . A yelp emerged from her lips as she crashed down to the middle of the street . Landing atop her legs , McCoy braced himself for the impact to come , unsure if he 'd thrown Keeler and himself completely clear of danger . When after a moment nothing happened , he realized that he no longer heard brakes whining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the patter of footfalls rose around him , and he risked a glance over his shoulder . The left front tire of the vehicle , McCoy saw , had come to a stop less than half a meter from his shins . He shuddered once , hard , a reaction driven by the stark reality of the peril he 'd only just narrowly escaped . Gathering himself , McCoy pushed away from Keeler and up onto his knees . He looked at her , and she regarded him in obvious shock , her eyes wide , her mouth agape . Though shaken , she appeared more or less unharmed . Around them , people scampered over from different directions . Several crouched down beside Keeler , while one man clad in a dark gray overcoat and a light brown fedora bent over McCoy . " You okay , Mister ? " the man asked , raising his voice to be heard over the snarl of the ground vehicle 's engine . His concern seemed genuine . " Yeah , " McCoy managed to say between deep inhalations of breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and legs , examined his hands , attempting to take stock of his physical condition . He felt pains in his knees and elbows , and a patchwork of bloody abrasions covered his palms , but he seemed otherwise uninjured . " A little banged up , " he admitted , " but I 'm all right . " Behind the man leaning over McCoy , the vehicle quieted , and its near door swung open . Hopping down onto the street , the driver appeared ashen , his wide eyes a mirror of Keeler 's own . " She walked right out in front of my truck , " he said in a rush . He addressed McCoy , but raised an arm and pointed to where Keeler still sat sprawled on the ground . " Soon as I saw her walkin ' across the street and saw she was n't gon na stop , I hit the brakes . " The driver looked to the man in the gray coat as though pleading for corroboration . " There was n't nothin ' else I could 've done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " McCoy said , his words coming more easily as he regained his breath . He pushed up from the street and rose , the man in the gray overcoat reaching a hand out to help . When McCoy had stood up fully , he fixed the driver of the truck with his gaze . " It was n't your fault , " he told him . " And anyway , we 're fine . " The driver stared back at McCoy , evidently trying to gauge the veracity of his statements . Finally , the driver exhaled loudly , and his body seemed to uncoil by degrees , like tension gradually being released from a spring . McCoy turned toward Keeler just as she began climbing to her feet . A man to either side of her reached down and clasped one of her arms , steadying her as she clambered up from the street . All around , other bystanders pressed in , many chattering about what had just happened and offering their observations and concerns . Keeler still looked staggered , appearing unable to focus on anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen from her head , leaving her hair tousled , with several errant strands fluttering down across her forehead . Her high-collared , navy blue cloak had fallen askew , uncovering her right arm and revealing that the sleeve of her white blouse had been torn open in several places . Where her pale flesh showed through the tattered garment , McCoy saw numerous scrapes and lacerations . " Are you all right , Miss Keeler ? " he asked . She slowly raised her head to look up at him  --  he stood nearly a dozen centimeters taller than she did  --  but it took a few seconds before her eyes found his . When they did , she nodded slowly , but said nothing . Around them , the small crowd grew quiet , perhaps waiting for her to speak . McCoy bent and retrieved Keeler 's hat before swinging himself around to her side , the two men who 'd helped her stand stepping back . He reached up and straightened her cloak about her , then gingerly took hold of her elbow and hand . The gathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keeler toward the doorway through which he 'd exited into the night only a few minutes ago . The memory of that , though fresh , paradoxically seemed to hark back to another lifetime . " You sure she 's gon na be all right , Mister ? " the driver asked as they passed him . " She 'll be fine , " McCoy replied without interrupting his stride . " I 'm a doctor . I 'll take care of her . " McCoy walked with Keeler past the front of the truck , its gray metal grillwork like the long fangs of some fearsome beast , the pungent odor of burned rubber and heated oil its foul breath . As they reached the curb , he heard the people congregated behind them begin talking again , their voices agitated as they spoke of the terrible accident that had nearly just occurred . McCoy steered Keeler up onto the sidewalk and then over to the twin doors that led into the 21st Street Mission . He reached to push open one of the doors , but then Keeler turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She peered up at him , some low level of awareness seeming to dawn on her face . " How stupid , " she said , her English accent discernible even in just the two words . " I 've been back and forth across this street a thousand times . I ought to have been killed . " She delivered her statements in a monotone , clearly not yet recovered from her trauma . " But you were n't killed , " McCoy told her , accompanying his words with what he hoped she would perceive as a reassuring smile . " Try not to think about it . It 's in the past . " He waved the back of his hand toward the street , the gesture intended to dismiss thoughts of how close they 'd both just come to being seriously injured , or even to losing their lives . " It 's going to be all right , " he concluded . Keeler glanced over at the truck for a second , and then back at McCoy . She offered a half-smile and nodded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Really , " McCoy insisted , reaching again for the door . " Everything 's going to be all right . " But as he ushered Edith Keeler into the mission , he recognized that he stood in a city on Earth , three hundred years before he 'd been born  --  three hundred years before he would be born . McCoy did not belong in this place or in this time . He had perhaps just saved a woman 's life , and had avoided being killed himself , but he realized now that , at least for him , there were no guarantees that anything would ever be all right again .
