ARS sets up regional programs to combat imported fire ants <p> Fire ants have been pests in the southern United States since their arrival in 1918 aboard merchant ships coming to Alabama from South America . They found their way onto land and have been multiplying and migrating ever since . <p> Now fire ants can be found throughout the southeastern United States . It 's estimated that up to 40 percent of all people living in urban areas infested with these insects are stung by fire ants each year , and the percentage is even greater in rural communities . <p> Imported fire ants pose a potentially deadly hazard to people , damage electrical equipment and farm equipment , create unsightly mounds , and alter the population mix of native insects and wildlife . They can even kill young cattle and other livestock . Forming a United Front <p> To combat this ongoing problem , the Agricultural Research Service 's Biological Control of Pests Research Unit in Stoneville , Mississippi , is conducting regional integrated management programs in that state as well as Alabama and Tennessee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents against red and black imported fire ants ( Solenopsis invicta and S. richteri ) and their hybrid . Researchers are also examining ways to preserve native ants , which are thought to slow reinfestation of areas by imported fire ants . Universities , federal and state agencies , and landowners are all cooperating with ARS researchers to combat fire ants in two specific areas : the Natchez Trace Parkway ( National Park Service ) and south-central Tennessee 's vital nursery crop production region . <p> The Natchez Trace Parkway , extending from Natchez , Mississippi , to Nashville , Tennessee , essentially represents a north-south transect along which red , black , and hybrid imported fire ants all occur . Thus it offers an ideal opportunity to try out the latest control technologies  --  and to develop new ones . Central Tennessee 's nursery industry is a vital part of the economy in that region . Imported fire ants mean increased production costs , because growers must treat their nursery stock with chemical insecticides to comply with imported fire ant quarantine regulations . One grower in the region has estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant sold  --  which does n't seem like much until you consider that a large nursery operation may ship thousands of plants at a time . <p> Comparative studies of various biological control measures being used against the different fire ants will result in new information on their effectiveness . Establishment of biological control agents in central Tennessee may slow the spread of the ants into nursery areas . A pathogen and several species of parasitoid flies are the most effective biological control agents currently known . Researchers hope these organisms will become established and spread throughout fire ant populations , giving native ants an opportunity to compete with and perhaps suppress imported fire ants . The Horrid Phorid <p> Fire ants face a nasty natural enemy in the phorid flies from the genus Pseudacteon . The tiny flies , some species less than 1 mm across , attack and parasitize fire ants , eventually decapitating them . How ? <p> A female fly injects a single egg into a worker fire ant . When the egg hatches , the immature maggot migrates to the ant 's head , where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This decapitates the ant , but the developing fly remains in the head capsule as a pupa . After a couple of weeks , a new adult fly emerges and begins the cycle again . <p> Postdoctoral researcher Larry G. Thead reared thousands of phorid flies for research and field releases . One tiny species , P. curvatus , has been successfully established on black and hybrid fire ants in a multistate release program that began in 2002 . Flies released in two pastures in Clay County , Mississippi , now occupy some 560,000 acres up to more than 28 miles from the release sites . Collaborators Kenneth and Rufina Ward , with Alabama A &M; University , and Jason Oliver , with Tennessee State University , have reported successful establishment and overwintering at Natchez Trace and nursery production sites . " We 're very excited about the dispersal rate , " says Thead . " Not only are the phorid flies attacking and parasitizing the ants , they are harassing them . This affects the ants ' ability to search for food , weakening colonies and allowing native ants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douglas A. Streett , who leads the Stoneville unit , believes that " the research unit 's proactive IPM approach to regional fire ant programs will be successful at controlling the insect 's populations . " Entomologist James " J.T. " Vogt is developing remote sensing techniques to gather information from airplanes about the abundance and distribution of fire ant mounds at targeted locations . A geographic information system , a computer system that collects and displays geographically referenced data , is being used to track fire ant populations and associated landscape characteristics . This reveals information that researchers need to map fire ant populations , track success of their control efforts , and guide research efforts in regional management programs . <p> Having developed methods for detecting 70 percent or more of mounds in some landscapes using airborne multispectral imagery , Vogt is investigating thermal characteristics of mounds to optimize timing of airborne thermal infrared data collection . " Adding another layer of information to multispectral images , specifically surface temperature , has the potential to improve detection and decrease false positives , " says Vogt . Integrating Pest-Management Techniques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management  --  combining tactics such as insecticidal baits with natural organisms . Chemical bait treatments alone are not sustainable , because fire ants will reinfest previously treated areas . But they can be very effective , consistently killing about 90 percent of colonies in an area when applied correctly . In the nursery industry , chemical control measures are sometimes necessary to protect workers and adhere to quarantine regulations . <p> Entomologist Jian Chen joined the Stoneville team in 2003 and hit the ground running . He has already developed a new bait formulation . <p> " Tests have shown that the bait is more water resistant , which means it will last longer in the field , " says Chen . " And it attracts fire ants better than previous formulas . " <p> In addition to attractants , repellents are being developed to keep fire ants away from areas where they are a nuisance and where it 's not practical to use insecticides because of health or environmental concerns . <p> Chen developed a fast , easy-to-perform fire ant repellent bioassay by taking advantage of fire ant digging and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  common ingredients found in cosmetics , personal care products , and plastics  --  as strong repellent candidates in possible formulations . Repellents could prove to be useful tools for keeping fire ants out of electrical equipment or out of nursery plants that are being held for shipment . Chen hopes the bioassay can be used to help find even more repellents . <p> The scientific team has also invented a red imported fire ant bait . The bait is licensed to ' and distributed by Waterbury Companies , Inc. , of Waterbury , Connecticut . <p> This research is part of Veterinary , Medical , and Urban Entomology , an ARS National Program ( #104 ) described on the World Wide Web at www.nps.ars.usda.gov . <p> Douglas A.

The ants are very aggressive and will readily attack anything that disturbs their mound , including humans . After firmly grasping the victim 's skin with its jaws , an ant arches its back and inserts its rear-end stinger into the flesh , injecting venom from a poison sac , inflicting seven or eight stings . Fire ant venom is unique because of the high concentration of toxins , which are responsible for a firelike burning pain . Stings can also cause swelling and tiny blisters and , in severe allergic reactions , hives , nausea , vomiting , breathing difficulty , and even death . <p>
