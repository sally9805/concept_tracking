Mortimer Laton was buried that morning in Haverhill , Massachusetts , the town where he had been born and lived his whole life . Actually , the town was newly named Haverhill in 1870 . It had been known as Pentucket when he was born and raised there . His wife , Ruth , was buried in one of the older cemeteries that was no longer available , having filled to capacity soon after she was interred there . She would n't have minded that her husband did n't rest for all eternity in a grave near her . Actually , she would probably have preferred it that way , since there was no love lost between them . The large marker that had been ordered for Mortimer was going to read : Here rests Mortimer Laton , beloved father of Amanda and Marian . Amanda Laton had prescribed the short sentiment , and for her it was most fitting . She had adored their father , and he , in return , had been the perfect father to her , providing everything a child needs in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been asked , would have left out the beloved part . The funeral had been a small gathering , and dismal as most funerals were , despite the fine weather that morning and the spring blooms that filled the grounds . Only Mortimer 's servants , a few of his business associates , and his two daughters had attended . The service had been notably quiet . No hysterics or loud tearful wails that morning , unlike Ruth 's funeral seven years ago where Marian had made a spectacle of herself , crying uncontrollably . But then she 'd felt that with her mother 's passing she had lost the only person who had ever really cared about her . Something similar should have happened today . Amanda , who had been her father 's favorite from the day she was born , should have been crying her heart out . But since the sisters had heard the news that their father had died on the way back from the business trip he 'd taken to Chicago last week , somehow falling off the train as he passed between one car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grief . An odd form of shock , the servants whispered , and Marian might have agreed , except her sister was n't denying that their father was gone . She spoke of his death and discussed it without emotion , as if she were discussing some mundane event of little concern to her . Shock ? Maybe , but of a kind Marian had never witnessed before . On the other hand , Amanda was a self-centered person , just like Mortimer . She was probably more concerned with how his death was going to affect her than with his actually being gone . Mortimer had been capable of loving only one person at a time . This was a realization Marian had come to at a very young age , and , eventually , she 'd stopped hoping it could be otherwise . And she 'd never seen her father behave in any way that indicated she was wrong . Her father had n't loved her mother . Theirs had been an arranged marriage . They were merely two people living together , sharing the same house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , but there was no love shared between them . His parents had died before Marian was born , so she 'd never seen how he behaved with them . And his only remaining sister had moved away when Marian was still a baby . Mortimer never spoke of her , an indication he could care less what had become of her . But their father had loved Amanda . There was absolutely no doubt of that in anyone 's mind . From the day she was born he 'd been charmed and had showered her with attention , spoiled her rotten actually . The sisters could be in the same room yet he 'd only see Amanda , as if Marian were invisible . But he was gone now . Marian could stop agonizing over it . It was n't as if he had n't seen to her material needs all these years . In that , the sisters had always been treated equally . It was only Marian 's emotional needs that had been neglected . Her mother had tried to correct that and had succeeded somewhat while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it hurt Marian to be excluded from Mortimer 's affections , and while she loved both her daughters , she had spared a little extra affection for Marian . Unfortunately , Amanda had noticed and was so jealous , wanting all her mother 's love exclusively , that it caused a breach between the sisters that had long ago gone beyond fixing . There was no tactful way to put it . They really and truly hated each other . It was n't just the jealousy issues . Those might have been overcome . The long list of grievances might even have been forgiven eventually , since most of them had stemmed from their childhood , which was over . But probably owing to the overabundance of spoiling and coddling , both of which fostered her self-centeredness , Amanda was , quite simply , not a nice person . Whether deliberately or based on a tendency that came naturally to her , Amanda managed with alarming frequency to hurt people 's feelings . The alarming part was , she did n't seem to care or notice the damage she caused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the times , there were so many , that she had personally tried to make excuses for her sister and apologize to the people Amanda hurt . It was n't as if she felt responsible for her sister 's actions . She did n't . Amanda had been nasty and spiteful from as far back as she could remember . Neither of them had any female friends to speak of . Amanda , because she did n't want any . She had their father to dote on her . He was her best friend . Marian had wanted friends , but she gave up long ago trying to make any because her sister would always drive them away , usually in tears . The result was , other girls did n't want to go anywhere near Marian again if it meant they might run into Amanda . Gentlemen were a different matter . Since both girls began approaching marriageable age , gentleman callers were in regular attendance at the Laton household . There was a twofold attraction  --  Mortimer 's wealth , reputed to be quite substantial , and the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls in town . And Amanda actually liked the male attention . She thrived on the flattery . And anytime someone showed up whom she did n't particularly want adoring her , she 'd belittle and subtly insult him until he stopped coming around . So she had her favorite group of admirers and she 'd had them for nearly a year . But she did n't favor any single one of them to the point of deciding which one she 'd like to marry . More 's the pity . Marian wished she would . She prayed each night that her sister would get married and move elsewhere , so she could get on with living a real life herself instead of hiding away , fearful that some man might try to court her and end up one of her sister 's targets . The two times she 'd shown any interest in a man , she 'd learned her lesson well . She was n't going to be responsible again for seeing them cut to the quick by Amanda 's tongue because they 'd dared to ignore Amanda in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were twins , Marian went to a lot of trouble to disguise that unfortunate fact . Not wanting to draw attention to herself , she chose dresses that were unflattering in color and extremely plain in design . She wore her hair in a severe style better suited to someone 's grandmother than a young woman barely eighteen . But her disguise would n't really have worked without the spectacles she wore . The frames were large and the lenses so thick , they magnified her eyes to nearly twice their size , giving her an odd , bug-eyed look that was very unattractive . They sat in their father 's study , listening to the reading of his will . Amanda looked beautiful as always , even in mourning black . Her dress was stylish ; she 'd have it no other way . Adorned with lace and tiny beads in artful designs , it was actually more flattering than some of her fancier gowns . Her coiffure was n't as frivolous as usual , the golden ringlets more tightly contained for once . Marian , on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no intricate frills on her black dress to be admired , no stylish bangs to frame her face or detract from the ugly spectacles that dominated her appearance . She was the moth next to the butterfly . While she suspected it was easy to be the butterfly , she knew for sure it was hard work being the moth . The room was almost unrecognizable , with Mortimer 's lawyer sitting behind the desk , rather than Mortimer . They knew Albert Bridges well . He had often been invited to dinner when their father found himself strapped for time and brought his work home with him . Albert usually called the sisters by their first names . He 'd known them long enough to do so . But today he addressed each of them as Miss Laton and he seemed uncomfortable doing his job . There had been no surprises in the will so far . A few family servants had been left small bequests , but the bulk of Mortimer 's estate had been left to his daughters  --  equally . Once again , it was only his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were interests in a half dozen businesses , income property in town as well as other parts of the state , a bank account larger than either girl could have imagined . But no real surprises  --  until the end . " There is one stipulation , " Albert told them , pulling at his collar nervously . " Your father wanted to assure that you would be well taken care of , and not be fooled by fortune hunters merely interested in your inheritance . So other than for essentials , none of his estate will be transferred to you until you marry . And until that time , his sister , Mrs. Frank Dunn , will be your guardian . " Amanda said nothing . She was frowning , but she had n't yet fully grasped the implications . Marian watched her , waiting for the storm to erupt once it sunk in . Albert Bridges had expected more of a reaction as well , and looking at each girl somewhat warily , asked , " Do you understand what this means ? " Marian nodded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Kathleen is n't going to change her life to accommodate us just because her brother died , so we will have to travel to her . Is that what you mean ? " He sighed in relief . " Exactly . I know it may seen daunting , having to move so far away from everything and everyone you know , but it ca n't be helped . " " Actually  --  I do n't mind at all . I have no real attachment to this city  --  " The storm arrived . Amanda shot to her feet so fast , she dislodged not one but two blond locks from her coiffure , both on the same side , so she now had a long wave of golden hair curling around and beyond her breast . Her dark blue eyes were flashing like sapphires under a jeweler 's light , and her lips had thinned to form a snarl . " Absolutely out of the question ! Do you have any idea where this unknown aunt of ours lives ? It 's the other side of the world ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Marian said calmly . " That is the same thing ! " Amanda yelled . " She lives among savages . " " The savages have been curtailed  --  mostly . " Amanda glared at her . " Shut up , just ... just shut up ! You go live in the wilds of Texas and rot and die for all I care . I 'll get married immediately and stay right here , thank you very much . " Albert tried to stop her , to explain further , but Amanda was too furious to listen and stalked out of the room . He gave Marian a long-suffering look . " She ca n't just  --  get married , " he told Marian with a weary sigh . " I did n't think so . " " I mean she can , but then she would forfeit her inheritance . As your guardian , your aunt must give her approval , for either of you to marry . " " Shall I fetch her back ? " Marian offered . " She has n't left the house yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door if she had . " " I 'll go after her . " Albert sighed again . " I should have been more clear to begin with . " Albert rose from behind the desk , but it was n't necessary . Amanda came marching back into the study on her own with Karl Ryan in tow . Karl was one of her hopeful suitors , her least favorite actually , but she tolerated him because he was handsome and considered a fine catch by any standards . As long as a man had other women interested in him , even if only one , Amanda wanted him interested in her instead because she thrived on the envy of other women . Karl had been on hand that morning to accompany them to the cemetery . Amanda had been too preoccupied to notice that he was the only one of her suitors to come by to offer his condolences . Marian knew that visitors were being turned away at the door with the simple explanation that the girls were n't receiving callers . Someone had decided they should have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no desire to deal with anyone just now . Amanda probably would have objected if she 'd known . Karl had been hard to turn away , though , since he 'd come by right after they 'd been told the news of Mortimer 's death , and he had heard about it from Amanda . He 'd been waiting in the parlor since they 'd returned from the funeral , prepared to offer as much comfort as he could today . But Amanda did n't appear to need comforting . She needed calming because she still looked furious . " There , I 've settled the matter , " Amanda said triumphantly . " I 'm now engaged to marry Mr. Ryan . So I 'll hear no more talk about leaving home . " And then she added snidely , " But I 'll be glad to help you pack , Marian . " " Unless Mr. Ryan is willing to travel with you to Texas , to meet your aunt and obtain her approval , marrying him will not release your inheritance to you , Miss Laton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without that approval , you would forfeit everything . " " No ! My God , I ca n't believe Papa did this to me . He knew I despise traveling . " " He did n't die on purpose just to inconvenience you , Amanda , " Marian said in annoyance . " I 'm sure he thought you 'd be settled long before he died . " " I will be most happy to travel with you to Texas , " Karl offered . " Do n't be absurd , " Amanda snapped at him . " Ca n't you see this changes everything ? " " No , it does n't , " Karl insisted . " I still want to marry you . " Marian saw what was coming , and tried to spare Karl 's feelings . " You should leave for the time being , " she suggested quickly . " She 's upset  --  " " Upset ! " Amanda shouted . " I 'm beyond upset . But yes , do leave . There 's no longer a reason for me to marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single one now . " Marian glanced away , unwilling to see just how crushed Karl was by those few careless words , but not soon enough . She saw it anyway . And he 'd looked so happy when he 'd come into the room moments ago , his heart 's desire unexpectedly achieved . He really did want Amanda for his wife . Heaven knew why , but he did . Somehow , he had n't seen or had chosen to ignore this vicious side of her  --  until now . But hopefully , after he got over the rejection , he would rejoice to have escaped marriage to such a heartless bitch .
