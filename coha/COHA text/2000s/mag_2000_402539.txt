Section : Phenomena : comment &; notes As deadly bacteria increasingly resist antibiotics , researchers try to improve a world war I era weapon <p> Amid the din from street musicians , panhandlers and baby-toting moms along Baltimore 's Inner Harbor , a petite woman wearing surgical gloves squats down on an embankment wall . She dips a sterile white bucket into the water , pulls it up , then peels off her gloves , and in seconds vanishes . <p> Few onlookers would guess Ekaterine Chighladze is a mercenary in a microscopic war . She marches the unsavory water past Camden Yards , the Baltimore Orioles ' playground , and ducks into a lab of the University of Maryland . <p> She repeats this process every two weeks . So even before her analysis , she knows the bucket is chock-full of naturally occurring predatory viruses called bacteriophages-phages for short . After more than a half century of neglect in the West , these tiny viruses are gaining new consideration as slayers of so-called superbugs-those often deadly bacteria ever more resistant to conventional drug treatment . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , " Alexander Sulakvelidze , who runs the lab , says from behind a lab bench piled high with agar dishes of bacteria . In 1998 the professor of medicine cofounded a Baltimore company called Intralytix to manufacture phages . " All the advances that we take such pride in , from transplants to chemotherapy , " he says , " may become impossible when bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics . " <p> According to a recent World Health Organization ( WHO ) report , nearly all gonorrhea strains are unchecked by penicillin in Southeast Asia . In India , typhoid species have developed resistance to three drugs commonly used against them . Drug-resistant tuberculosis has invaded one in ten TB patients in Estonia , Latvia , and parts of Russia and China . In Thailand , the top three antimalarial drugs have been rendered useless . <p> " The phenomenon is n't just happening in developing nations , " says Richard Honour , president and CEO of Phage Therapeutics International , a fledgling company in Bothell , Washington . " More American lives are lost each year to antibiotic-resistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . The WHO reports that some 14,000 people die each year just from drug-resistant infections picked up in U.S. hospitals . Worldwide , up to 60 percent of hospital-acquired infections turn out to be drug-resistant . <p> Phages are among the simplest organisms on the planet . About a millionth of an inch in size , a fraction of most bacteria , phages become visible only under an electron microscope . A milliliter of water can contain up to a trillion . They thrive anywhere bacteria can exist-in raw sewage , open water , humans and practically everywhere else , says Carl Merril , chief of the biochemical genetics lab at the National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) . Some phages reproduce by invading a bacterium and forcing it to manufacture copies of the phage until the host is overwhelmed , he explains . Eventually , the progeny either dissolve or burst the cell wall , destroying the host bacterium , and move on , ready to prey on surrounding bacteria . A single phage can produce tens of thousands of offspring in an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming a part of the bacterium 's genome . When the bacterium reproduces , so does the phage . <p> Human phage therapy is hardly new . Before the discovery of penicillin , pioneering doctors around the world employed phages as healers , giving them by potion or injection . These stalkers of bacteria were discovered during World War I by British bacteriologist Frederick Twort and independently two years later by the French-Canadian Felix D'Herelle , a self-taught medical maverick then at the Pasteur Institute in Paris . Both observed mysterious activity that produced clear areas in agar plates otherwise cloudy with thriving bacteria . Something was killing the bacteria . D'Herelle identified the microscopic marvel as a new type of parasite . " In a flash I had understood what caused my clear spots was in fact an invisible microbe ... a virus parasitic on bacteria , " he wrote . He named it bacteriophage , derived from two Greek words and meaning " bacteria devouring . " <p> Early on , phages held much promise in conquering many of the world 's scourges . D'Herelle went on to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capital of Georgia . There , they harvested phages from the nearby Kura River for culturing . Though D'Herelle left during the Stalinist era and Eliava was executed , the Eliava Institute of Bacteriophage , Microbiology , and Virology flourished . In the late 1930s , it churned out phages by the ton . Patients threw back their heads and swallowed a solution of the phages . Several major U.S. pharmaceutical companies-Eli Lilly , for one-entered the field . <p> But the advent of sulfa drugs and antibiotics in the 1940s relegated phages to the backseat-at least in Western countries . While phages frequently and inexplicably failed , antibiotics , it seemed , were fail-safe . Physicians preferred the new class of drugs because they were relatively easy to use , killed a broad spectrum of bacterial infections and did n't pose the risk living organisms do . <p> Later on , because of their structural and genetic simplicity and ease of growth in the lab , Western researchers tapped bacteriophages as model systems to study the molecular basis of genetics , spawning the science of molecular biology . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through research on phages and their bacterial hosts . " If you look at the early Nobel Prizes in molecular biology , half of the awards went to researchers using phages , " NIMH 's Merril says . The work also helped researchers understand the shortcomings of phage therapy of the past . Some of the preparations were contaminated . On top of that , early researchers did n't realize that each phage type is highly specific for a given bacteria species , more finicky than Morris the cat . <p> Back in the Baltimore lab , Chighladze painstakingly isolates phages from harbor water by culturing them with sundry strains of bacteria . Modern technology can decipher which type of phage kills which type of bacteria . For a broad spectrum assault , purified phages can then be combined in cocktails . <p> Over time , bacteria naturally develop resistance to phages , as they do to antibiotic drugs . Drug resistance , however , has been accelerated by global misuse of antibiotics . Phages , in contrast , can adapt to keep up with the bacteria , matching their prey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race , " explains Sulakvelidze , a former Georgian lab director who worked extensively with the Eliava Institute . Back in Tbilisi , phages never fell out of fashion . They 've been in use in humans for 70 years with claims of miraculous results . Phages offer other advantages over antibiotics . For starters , they do n't harm benevolent bacteria living in symbiosis with human hosts . But even with such positive traits , phages do have their downside . Rather than kill bacteria , some phages make them even more lethal . This happens , for example , with the bacterium that causes cholera . <p> In the mid-1980s interest in the West was renewed when British and Polish researchers studied phage success against microbes in animals . But burgeoning cases of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections really prompted the surge in Western research . <p> Today Intralytix and Phage Therapeutics , like a handful of other companies , are developing phage catalogs to sequence the genetic code of a select hundred or so of the inestimably large number of species of bacteria-killing viruses found in nature . Although Intralytix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , other companies are attempting to genetically engineer phages so that they overcome bacterial resistance . <p> The first human clinical trials in the United States are slated to begin within a year . Possible applications include impregnating artificial skin or other materials with phages to heal infected wounds , intravenously medicating patients suffering from bacterial infections of the bloodstream , and culturing custom phage therapies from infected patients . <p> Psychological barriers to phage acceptance remain . " Some people worry about getting treated with a virus , " Merril says , " but they do n't realize that many of today 's leading vaccines are made with live virus . " Yet even Merril doubts phages will ever be a panacea or more than an adjunct to antibiotics . <p> Whatever the future , phages have already earned a respected place in the annals of medicine . We shall see how much larger their entry becomes . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : This phage , a kind of virus , is 270,000 times life-size .
