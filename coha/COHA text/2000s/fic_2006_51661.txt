THEY FOUND THE FIFTH BODY a mile and a half into Schnitkes woods , and then , after combing another mile , Hansen found the shooter . The rifle lay in the leaves beside the shooter 's body , which looked , already , like nothing more than a lump of dark green parka , threadbare corduroy trousers , and work boots . A black mark like a burn was torn across what remained of his left cheek . He 'd flinched , Hansen guessed , or tried to pull the rifle away last moment . But the second shot had accomplished its intended effect . From the base of his chin up , all that remained to identify him was the straight , rubber-black hair . Hansen knew who the shooter was , and he was n't surprised . <p> It was cold , even for late November , and the rescue squad and Hayward police were out in the young birches and scrub and low-growing sumac that did n't block much of the wind . The ground was hard with frost , and the air so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band Hansen could hear it on the captain 's radio a half mile away . As the other men in the squad passed him , combing for more bodies , Hansen saw the same hard-set , deliberately blank expression on their faces he imagined he wore himself . Except for the captain they were all part-timers , and among them Hansen was unremarkable : wide in the shoulders but pigeon chested ; deep-set , lusterless brown eyes . He wore a mustache but had recently shaved it off , leaving a patch of lighter skin above his lip that stung a little in the cold wind . <p> Twenty minutes earlier the others had stood over the first body , each looking stunned and queasy . Hansen had just gone on ahead . Now he rose from crouching over the shooter and went back , putting the thing together as he came to the victims again . Old Schnitke-beard , sunglasses , a dribble of chew down his chin-had been shot in the legs , chest , and stomach . His grown son lay face down ten feet away . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schnitke never let anyone but family hunt on his land . Hansen was a hunter himself , though a casual one , and knew that Schnitkes four hundred acres , all hills and good ground cover , were laced with deer trails . Wherever there was a high vantage , Schnitke had nailed up a stand . Schnitke , his son , and a short man in blue jeans lay within fifty feet of one of the stands . The other two victims were farther away , a hundred yards or so . The way Hansen saw it , they 'd been chased down and shot , repeatedly , in the back . <p> Hansen heard footsteps in the leaves and a burst of static on the emergency band . The squad captain crested a low hill and hailed him . " Jesus , he just opened up , did n't he ? " the captain called out . <p> When the captain came alongside , he reached over and gave Hansen 's shoulder a quick , sympathetic squeeze . They stood a moment looking into the woods . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and hope there is n't anything else to find . " <p> Luce never used her phone-bad energy zapped right into your skull , she said-so Hansen had no way of asking her not to come over . She would n't want to hear about what he 'd seen . He did n't want to tell her either . <p> It was late in the afternoon . He was standing at the window with the comforter from his cot bed pulled over his shoulders when he heard her boots clumping up the back stairs . He let the comforter slide to the floor , went to the stove , stirred himself a cup of instant , and sat heavily at the card table in the kitchen . <p> When she came through the back door and down his narrow , carpeted back hallway , he saw right away the sweat on her forehead . She knocked the mud and snow off her boots on the long floor mat and said , " You could 've come to my place last night . " She took off her heavy coat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the kitchen counter and started putting away his dishes . <p> Hansen rented the top floor of a weathered little Victorian in the older half of Hayward . His downstairs neighbor had moved away months ago ; the landlord , who 'd bought the property intending it for a summerhouse , lived down in Milwaukee . For the last two weeks the thermostat had been broken so that it kept the radiators working all day . Hansen had them all closed off but one . The windows were wide open , and every few minutes a breeze billowed the curtains into the room and then pushed them flat against the wall again . <p> " Too exhausted to go anywhere but here , " Hansen said . <p> Luce came to the table with her arms held tightly across her chest , trying not to shiver . " How can you sleep in this temperature ? " She kissed him softly and sat down . A strand of her red brown hair blew into her face . She brushed it away . God , she was pale , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt . " Who was it ? " she said . " They have n't been saying on the TV . " She stared at a spot between Hansen 's coffee cup and his Outdoor Wisconsin magazine . " It was Joe Bee Cheng , was n't it ? " <p> Hansen took a couple sips before answering . He thought he was close to drained ; the caffeine was lighting him up again . " Done all the wrong he was ever going to do now , " he told her . <p> " They 'll put him away forever . " <p> Hansen shook his head no . " Shot himself . " <p> Luce blanched , and for a moment she looked like she 'd be sick . But then she said confidently , almost bitterly , " Some people just are n't built right . That sheriff should 've locked him up a long time ago . " She sat another moment staring through the doorway into his nearly bare living area , her expression growing cloudy and agitated . With her high brow and delicate features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . Sometimes she was the image of her Norwegian mother , who 'd made the crossing alone in her thirties , pregnant and with very little English . <p> " Sheriff never quite had anything to lock him up over , " Hansen said . But in her distraction , Luce did n't seem to hear . She reached into her purse and brought out her pill tray . She started lining them up on the table-three light brown capsules , four dark red gels , four round white tablets the size of dimes-her " longevity " pills . Lecithin , calcium AEP . . . He could n't remember half the names of all the supplements and concentrates . <p> She went to the sink to fill a glass with water . When her back was turned , Hansen swept the little collection of pills off the table and into his hand and then took up the pill tray as well . Without turning to him Luce said , " You toss those , I 'm out sixty bucks . " <p> " Then I give you thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " I need them . Especially today . " <p> Hansen stood and went to the nearest open window . " Why did n't I dump your ass when I found out about this shit ? " he said . <p> Luce cocked her head to one side and smiled wanly . " Because you want me around . " <p> Hansen squeezed the pills in his fist until he felt the sticky outer coatings coming off on his skin . He dropped them out of the window , down to the mud , melting snow , and scavenged lawnmower parts that was his backyard , and then he turned over the pill tray as well . He tossed the tray back onto the table and wiped both his hands on his jeans . <p> " You 're an asshole , " Luce said . She stood with the empty drinking glass in her hand , looking down at him indignantly from the raised kitchen . Hansen sat and went back to his coffee . After a few minutes the dread stillness that had descended on them seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth . " Let 's go somewhere , " she said . " It 's like a deep freezer in here . " <p> " I turn that busted heater back on , it 'll be roaring . " <p> " Then let 's go . " <p> Hansen got his wallet and keys from the counter and started dosing the windows . It might snow , it might rain ; the weather had been wild the last few weeks . When they were crossing the gravel drive to Hansen 's junked-up Plymouth , Luce stopped suddenly and said , " Hey , wait " He turned to her . The cold wind was bringing some color back into her face . " Write me a check for that thirty first . " <p> The TV news had got it before the papers , and the national TV before the local . That morning they 'd already had aerial footage of the state police doing their crime scene work . The people interviewed were all from Sawyer County-old Schnitke 's ex-wife , Joe Bee Cheng 's nearest neighbor , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize . There was footage of hunters , walking the streets of Hayward , and pickup trucks with bucks tied to the beds , skimming through the thin layer of slush on the roads . There was a long shot of the Hayward fishing museum : a huge fiberglass structure-half the length of a city block-shaped like a northern pike . It must have looked ridiculous , Hansen thought , to the outside world . <p> Seven years back the government had settled two thousand Hmong refugees in St. Paul and Minneapolis . Some of them left the cities for little towns in Minnesota and northwest Wisconsin , where they could eke out a form of the subsistence living that had always been their habit . The secret war the government had recruited the Hmong to fight in Laos in the early sixties had n't been much on the minds of the people of Hayward when Cheng and his family moved into a big clapboard house outside of town . Still , it was generally understood that Cheng 's father had fought the communists and that the payment for his service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheng and his family . The TV did have some new information : Joe Bee had been in the National Guard for a year , doing desk work mostly , but also getting sharpshooter training along the way . That was n't quite the revelation the network made it out to be . If there was one thing the population of the north woods thought they knew about the Hmong , it was that they were hunters and liked guns . Hansen saw the bumper stickers every now and then : SAVE A DEER , SHOOT A HMONG . <p> Hansen had been out to Cheng 's residence once with the squad on a domestic . The call that went through to Dispatch said something about Cheng waving a pistol around ; half of Sawyer County 's emergency response turned out that night . Hansen had heard the rumors about Cheng beating up his wife ; but when he and the others finally arrived at that tumbledown place out in the middle of the woods , she did n't want to tell or show them anything . There had been all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheng cussing out his kids , even the two little girls . There was talk about the home life coming from the Sawyer County magnet school . In town the kids clung to Cheng and scuffled around the grocery and the hamburger stand and the one pizza restaurant as if they were still in a refugee camp . Over the course of one tourist season a few summers back , the local free weekly had printed a series of human interest features on the Hmong in Wisconsin with profiles of Asian-American civic leaders and big stock photos of Hmong women in their traditional dress-the embroidered tunics and heavy pleated dresses , the bright checkered hats , all the silver jewelry and the large cloth purses hung with silver coins . The Sawyer County summer crowd would 've been disappointed to see Cheng 's wife haunting the racks of the Salvation Army and the local church sales all winter . <p> Hansen watched three different accounts of the shootings on three channels that morning . The Minneapolis station did n't have any new developments , but the network talked about racial slurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The third broadcast , another network , was making Schnitke out to be some beloved member of the community . That 's when Hansen turned the TV off . Schnitke was just a semiretired blowhard with a snowmobile rental business and some land to his name . When his business had been booming , Schnitke hired and fired like he was some big deal . Hansen had been through the ringer with him enough times-repairing and renting the snowmobiles , a few months doing landscaping on Schnitke 's property-to swear he 'd never take his money again . No one deserved what had happened to Schnitke 's party . But part of the thing , the way Hansen saw it , was that Schnitke had just about asked for what he got . <p> They drove down to Cindy 's Mixed Emotions , sat in the corner at one of the vinyl-covered tables , and ordered a fried walleye basket and a house salad , an ice water for Luce and a pot of coffee for Hansen . Luce had a couple of days off from her job cooking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about what they might do-maybe drive down to Eau Claire or even the Dells . If the weather was n't so bad , they could go to Mill Bluff and hike around all those weird white sandstone buttes that seemed to just rise up out of nowhere . Luce picked at her salad . She said she 'd heard they were hiring at the cranberry marsh in the spring ; maybe she 'd take a part time scooping berries if she could schedule it around the buffet . She said she could use the exercise . <p> Four men in hunting camo came in and sat at the horseshoe-shaped bar , draping their heavy coats over their stools . They spoke with smoothed-over north woods accents , and their outdoor gear was clean and too expensive ; Hansen knew right away that they were from the Twin Cities . Cindy lined them up four Point Specials . " You guys giving the deer a little break ? " she said as a joke . <p> One of the men was tall and red faced and wore a closely trimmed beard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily enough . " We 'd be swimming in deer guts if all that bullshit had n't scared them off , " the man said . " Say , give us four Budweisers , why do n't you , not this chalk and water . And a round of whatever that brandy back there is . " <p> Cindy was a big , broad-shouldered woman with enough pride to ignore him . " No Budweiser here . " She started popping the tops on the Points . " Surprised you 're out at all , after what happened . " <p> Hansen heard the other three men quietly agree with her . But the guy with the beard was n't going to drop it . " Maybe this 'll teach those squirrel eaters to start respecting private property . Think they can go anywhere they want , shoot anything that moves . Jerk was lucky it was n't my land . " <p> " Jesus , " Luce said under her breath . Hansen went back to his lunch . The guy was drunk ; he did n't know what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still pricked up . Over the clunking of the automatic dish scrubber going in Cindy 's kitchen , he heard the four hunters kidding each other about all the deer they had n't bagged that day . A burst of rollicking laughter went up from the bar . They were joking around as if it was just another day for sitting up in a tree stand freezing their asses off . <p> Hansen heard himself , as if from a distance , clearing his throat loudly and saying , " I heard of some hicks coming through here , but not hicks from the St. Paul suburbs . " Either the room went half-quiet or the dish scrubber had gotten louder . Hansen saw embarrassed looks pass over the other three men 's faces . <p> The bearded guy slouched himself off his bar stool and sauntered toward their table , grinning at them . " Who are you , friend ? " the man asked , coming forward to lean over the fake gold-plated railing that separated the restaurant from the bar . " You the Hmong fan club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scent . <p> Hansen did n't answer . He did n't push his chair back and stand up and face the guy . He could n't even look him in the eyes . <p> The guy spoke again : " What d' you think , friend ? Think they should send us some more of those crazy assholes ? Like maybe we got a squirrel problem , and we need more Asians to get rid of them ? " <p> Hansen suddenly felt , despite the anger welling in him , utterly deflated . The tone of the guy 's voice , the smirk in it , told him that he was only being baited . The guy did n't give a damn about what had happened out in the woods . He did n't care what Hansen had seen . He just wanted his buddies to think that he was rowdy enough to start a fight with some local . <p> " Take it back to your cabin and stop wrecking our lunch , " Hansen finally said , but at the moment he began to speak , Cindy called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys ! " she said , though the moment when something might have happened had passed . She flipped up the hinged section of the bar and came out into the restaurant . " Hold on , now . " As she took the bearded man by the arm and led him back to his stool , she looked at Hansen reproachfully , as he 'd been responsible for the disturbance . " Come on , " she said to the guy when she had him settled , " you said four shots of brandy , right ? They 're on me . Courvoisier OK ? It 's the best I got . " <p> The four men started drinking and laughing again . When Hansen and Luce paid and went out , the bearded guy did n't even turn to look . <p> That day and the next the weather was clear and very cold . They went out driving , as far as a quarter tank of gas would get them and back . They went up along the north shore of Lac Court D'Oreilles , where they saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though ice was already skinning over the lake . They drove out into the country , passing squat wooden ranches and cabins with deer strung up in the yards , fields of late-growing soy and chewed-up half stalks of corn , and finally came back hugging the Namekagon River , stopping for ten minutes to kick around the old dam and the millpond and the ruins of the timber sheds that were all that remained of the big mill that had once been the heart and blood of Hayward . <p> Luce 's apartment was half of a prefab duplex on the north side of town . Her windows looked out on the skeleton of the next building in the line of new development . The next building had been sitting unfinished for nearly a year . Inside , Luce 's place still felt new and clean and blank , even with all the black-and-white and sepia family photos she had hung and the old tasseled quilts pinned to the walls . A huge console TV sat in one corner , with a face drawn in the dust by Hansen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the apartment was given over to large , leafy plants , most of which were overgrowing their pots . It was cozy enough , but then there were the emptied cardboard packages stacked next to the kitchen garbage . At one time Luce had kept her little army of pill bottles lined up on the counter . Now he could hardly talk to her if they were n't hidden out of sight . <p> They were just going to kill an hour before they went to shoot pool , maybe play some euchre with a woman Luce knew from work and her husband . But as they stood in the kitchen chatting idly , Hansen felt a sudden swell of desire . He took her by the hand and pulled her , despite her protests , into the bedroom . He brought her down to the mattress . He kicked his boots off , then twisted around and unlaced hers . He came back up her body , running his lips along the skin that peeked between her jeans and her sweater . He wet his lips and pressed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand inside her jeans and fingered the elastic of her underwear . He stuck his tongue in her ear . . . . But then he felt Luce pushing herself up and away from him . She rocked back onto her knees at the end of the bed . She looked away . " This is n't a great time to think about loving , " she said . <p> He did n't ask why . He must have thought it loud enough . <p> " Dead guys in the woods do n't help , " she said . <p> She stepped down from the bed and went to the kitchen sink . She ran the cold water and splashed it into her face . When she came back to the bed , she flopped down and said , " I got no energy lately . " <p> Hansen rolled onto his back and closed his eyes . When he 'd first started with the rescue squad-to make an extra hundred a week after the small-engine work he did-he and Luce had been dating five weeks . The week after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forty minutes outside of Hayward . Hansen had been there in the back of the ambulance when her mother died on the stretcher . She 'd gone quietly , a stroke . " Even if we 'd gotten to her in time . . . " he told Luce . <p> That was what it was all really about , he thought , Luce filling herself up with so many fucking supplements , she was poisoning herself . It was about her mother . The first time he 'd confronted her about the amount she was taking-Christ she was dosing herself four times a day when she had the cash-Luce had just smiled . " You crap half of it out anyway , " she said . But then she complained about not sleeping . Her appetite dropped to near nothing . She lost ten pounds in two weeks . " Positive side effects , " she joked . <p> He 'd wanted to tell her that night , three years ago , how peaceful her mom had looked when she went . But somehow he knew that was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it easier for her to know about the stroke ; all the way up to the end , she 'd criticized her mom for not exercising , for keeping too many electrical appliances running at once pouring out radiation all over the house . And Luce had seemed calm after her mom passed . She 'd organized the funeral herself , sent out thank-you cards to the guests that same week . Even then Hansen saw she was n't taking it right . Now he thought that maybe her mother 's death was the thing that had kept them together for three years . <p> Hansen opened his eyes . For a moment all he seemed to see were the ends of his eyelashes . Then his eyes refocused on the bedside clock . It was much later than he 'd realized . <p> " You know what I like about you ? " Luce said , turning to lay her head on his chest . <p> " Yeah ? You were calling me an asshole and all that this morning . " <p> " The quiet . You 're so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming in between the shades , and she 'd positioned herself so it shone on her face . She was either smiling or squinting . <p> Hansen looked up at the yellowed and pocked ceiling tile . " I talk , " he said . " I 'm talking to you . I told that prick at the bar to fuck himself . " <p> Luce made a gentle scolding sound . Neither of them spoke . The room had gone very still . Somewhere in the far distance there came the dull knocking of a woodpecker . Hansen slipped into a doze with the sound of it , then woke himself deliberately . <p> " Do you like me ? Or love me ? " <p> Luce did n't reply . <p> He nudged her . " Hey . Did you hear ? " <p> Oh , " she said , " a little of both , I guess . " <p> " Keep stringing me along . Great . " A hardness slipped into his voice that he had n't intended . " You 've said you love me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt and curled one of his chest hairs on her finger . " Now you need reassuring all of a sudden ? " <p> " You not wanting to fuck me does n't help . " <p> " I told you already . " <p> " Told me what ? " <p> But Luce only said , " Do you think Schnitke did something to set him off ? " <p> " Shut up about that . I do n't want to talk about Joe Bee . Anyway , Schnitke had a right to say things . It was his land . " <p> " You do n't believe that . " <p> Hansen turned her off his chest and propped himself up on both elbows . She looked irritated to have been disturbed . " How am I going to get you to quit those pills ? " he said . <p> " Jesus , leave me alone . " <p> " You going to cash that check ? " <p> " What do you think ? " <p> " That we 're both going broke . " <p> Luce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more important . " <p> He did n't answer her for a long time . He thought he must be as tired as she said she was . They were n't going out to play pool or euchre that night . They were n't going anywhere . Why could n't he take her by the shoulders and shake all the fear and silly delusions out of her ? But it was all too deep . It would never budge . When he said her name gently , she was asleep . A few minutes later the knocking of the woodpecker suddenly stopped . He only noticed because it stopped . He got up quietly and left the apartment , left her sleeping . <p> Hansen stayed up that night with coffee and the TV . Midafternoon the next day he went down to the fire and rescue complex to ask the squad captain if he could punch in for a few hours . But he looked so bleary and pale , the captain just sent him back home . Hansen lay on his sofa in his underwear and socks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep but could n't let himself go all the way ; and as the sun dropped the length of the one window he 'd left open to the light and to the cold , his thoughts grew more lethargic and confused . <p> The news footage seemed to play again in his mind . All of those aerial shots , you felt like you were floating up above it as well . From above it was just another five-minute tragedy . No one wanted to know what he 'd seen . Cheng had put six bullets in Schnitke-three of them into his belly . One of the men who 'd got it in the back had been plugged twice right at the base of his neck . None of them had had much chance to run . Even with the rifle Cheng had been carrying-a cheap semi-automatic , just a catalog gun-he could have done it faster . But the bodies all looked strangely intact , as if the November cold , the first deep cold of the year , had reached inside of them and stopped their blood and heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was , looked like it had come all of a sudden to its natural state . <p> " Some people just are n't built right . " That 's what Luce had said . That 's what she had to believe . Even if her pills did nothing , she had to believe in them . It was blind , desperate faith . There was no tricking the body . Nothing in a pill could rebuild cells or stop dopamine loss or molecule damage or whatever the hell any of those companies claimed . The body went about the mundane business of dying and living just as always . Cheng had flinched ; his body had tried to thwart even that last act of will . <p> Hansen rose for a time and paced between the bedroom and the bathroom , glaring at his reflection in the mirror for minutes on end , throwing out curses at the dark shapes that filled his apartment . <p> There was no part of him built for belief . He felt that , alone , he could hardly bear up under the weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm lying beside you . Sometimes he lay in bed next to Luce in the morning waiting for her to wake . She woke with a kind of bewilderment already in her eyes , as if she were surprised to wake still herself , still in the same bed , with the same man , in the same place , the same pictures on the wall that she never changed . Each morning she chose to stay ; that was what tied them together . <p> But Hansen had to get away from all of the death . A lot of people had moved away from Hayward . There was work in the Cities , especially for a man who had nothing to sustain in the world but himself . He had enough cash in his wallet for two tanks of gas . There was a guy he 'd gone to high school with who managed a cold warehouse outside of Minneapolis ; Hansen guessed he could get second-shift work picking frozen food orders within the week . <p> He threw open another window . He tried to turn down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't going to fix itself . The temperature of the air that swaddled him soared and plummeted as he lay down again on the sofa . Just above sleep he found himself in those woods . His feet stirred the leaves ; but the trees above him , the scrub that ranged out to the horizon , nothing else moved . He went forward alone . It felt as if he would never stop walking . Each minute he expected to find a body . But there was nothing-only the woods stretching out ahead without end . <p> It seemed to come to him with the change in light , the graying of the sky before the sun rising : He wanted to see Cheng lying face up in the leaves with half his head torn off . Wanted to look down and see the sick flesh-flower that bloomed , when the bullet went in , through what had only looked like a face , only looked like a person . To witness it again , though it was all he saw every time he closed his eyes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard Luce coming up the back steps . But when he struggled up and went to the door , he heard that it was a branch on the big , half-hollow oak rattling against the building . <p> What he thought through the rest of the night he could n't put his head around , and what sleep he had was only a dream of sleep . When the sun began to push itself over the lip of his window , the clock read almost seven . He rolled himself from the sofa and dressed in long underwear , jeans , and a lined jacket . <p> He pulled his car to the edge of the dirt-and-gravel track that wound to the top of the hill that looked down on the clapboard house . Black walnuts and bur oaks crowded the shallow valley all the way out to the county highway three miles away . In spring Hansen would n't have been able to pick out the small , leaf-covered clearing in which the house was set , but now he could see down into its large , disorderly backyard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breeze rose up . A leaf blower lay in pieces on top of an unvarnished , greening picnic table . A heavy nylon rope , a line for dressing and hanging deer , was strung from one corner of the house to the stripped trunk of a blue pine . <p> Hansen cut the lights , the engine , and the heat ; and when it got cold in the car , he sat on his hands . For nearly an hour he watched small eddies of wind dancing the leaves across the yard . Finally a light went on in the kitchen , and a figure came to the window and began to work at the sink . <p> The hair was shoulder length , but from a distance Hansen could n't see if it was the wife or one of the daughters . What age would the oldest daughter be now ? Twelve , thirteen ? Cheng 's daughters might have been pretty . But in town they walked with their heads down , always averting their eyes . Hansen was n't sure he 'd really ever gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the window worked steadily , dipping away every few minutes to gather another dish or do some small chore . For an instant Hansen felt a connection dance out between them-that they were both awake and aware at such an early hour seemed curious to him-but then he shut that thought off and opened the car door . <p> He gently opened the trunk and brought out his soft leather rifle case . He knelt in the gravel and carefully unscrewed the scope from its bracket , beating his hands softly against his legs every few moments to keep his fingers working . The air felt clean and cold and close up against his cheeks . When he turned , the figure at the window had disappeared , but it came back after a minute . He took up the scope and sighted the figure . It was Cheng 's wife . She wore an oversize button-down shirt that hung so loosely from her tiny frame it looked like a slack sail . Her fine , black hair was tied back in a ponytail . As she worked , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance . <p> Her face was so somber and expressionless , Hansen thought . Like all of their faces seemed to be . Did she ever smile , laugh , curse , let something annoy her for even a second ? She was opaque to him , as opaque as any stranger , yet he 'd knelt over her husband 's body . He might even have been the one to bring her the news , to tell her that she was suddenly free of his wildness and abuse . But did she feel it as a release ? Now she and her daughters were loose of him , in a place thousands of miles from home , a home that itself would n't even have them . Or was she grieving for her husband-despite everything that had happened ? Her face-her flat , broad nose , her oddly triangular chin-kept wavering in the field of his sight as his hand trembled in the cold . But each time she came back into view , her expression only told him of exhaustion . <p> Her eyes suddenly lit on something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with his own eyes saw a good-sized doe picking its way cautiously across the backyard . It rubbed up against the picnic table , marking it , went underneath the bare nylon line , and then stepped back into the trees . Hansen raised the scope again to watch Cheng 's wife watching the doe disappear . Her eyes still showed him nothing , but for the briefest moment she smiled thinly-a smile that seemed neither resigned nor defiant , but merely an acknowledgment of the passing presence of another creature . A strong gust of wind blew , and Hansen could n't help his whole body from shivering in the cold . He heard himself breathing through his nose so quickly it was fogging the sight . Some time later he found that he had lowered the scope and was himself only staring off into the distance . <p> At Luce 's apartment , he scratched his spare key into the lock and went in . He found the pills behind a row of picture albums in her bookcase . He pulled the albums out one by one and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles . He put the albums back in their places as carefully as he had removed them , then went to the sink , wet his hands , and rubbed his eyes until he felt the sting of his early rising subside . <p> He went into her room and stood watching her sleep . In sleep she was never frantic ; she was never anxious or mysterious . He took off his jacket , folded it neatly , and put it beside the bed .
