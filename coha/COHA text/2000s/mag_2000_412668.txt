Young Catholics craving community may be just the ones to model how to live with the Trinity . // At the heart of Catholic identity lies a dormant doctrine , asleep in books of theology and the new Catechism of the Catholic Church . I am convinced that an active living of this doctrine may yet emerge from the unlikeliest of places : the post-baby boomer generations in the church . Those born after the 1960s may well be in a position to restore the Trinity-as a way of life-to its centrality in Catholic identity . If post-boomer generations accept the sort of life to which the Trinity invites us , we may save this doctrine from being the Loch Ness Monster of Catholic doctrine , surfacing only annually on Trinity Sunday , then sinking beneath the surface for another year . The royal road to a spiritual identity for many post-boomers is through personal experience , not doctrine . And if there is one great trust that Christians have , it is that God as Trinity is not just a doctrine . God as Trinity is above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us have experiences of being made whole , of wanting to fully accept and love others and to be fully accepted and loved . We have experiences of wanting to relate rightly and responsibly to others in society . We have experiences of personal hurt and outrage at violations of our dignity and the dignity of others . We have desires for healthy relationships with family , friends , lovers , creation , and God . All of these are little experiences of salvation , experiences of being a little more fully human and a little more fully divine . The language that Catholic tradition has developed for these experiences is the language of Trinity . When we say Trinity we mean that these experiences of salvation are of fered to us in three ways : from the depths of a mysterious all-pervasive presence that we have called God the Father , through the presence with us in history of our brother Jesus Christ , and in the power of the comfort , fire , and zeal of the Holy Spirit . But these words have become so rote and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trinity , I offer seven ways that young Catholics can live the Trinity today . 1 Take seriously the holiness of the life-giving relationships that make you who you are . When we speak of God as Trinity , we are saying that God is God because of God 's relationships . God 's relationships are often described as Father , Son , and Spirit in relationship with each other . This three-personed relationship makes God uniquely God . Just as you would be absolutely unrecognizable to anyone else without the relationships that have formed you , God would be absolutely unrecognizable to us without God 's own three-fold relationships . In our culture and sometimes in our religion , we tend to talk a lot about how unique each of us is . But living a Trinity life changes our focus from the uniqueness and holiness and dignity of ourselves to the uniqueness and holiness and dignity of our relationships . We can better understand God as Trinity by thinking about our own relationships . What have been the most important relationships in your life , that have helped make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring you the most joy , your joy reverberates in the very heart of God . Each of us must ask what needs to change in our lives in order to really value the holiness of our life-giving relationships . 2 Live as young mystics , aware of the mystery of God present in all of life . If I ask you to imagine the person to whom you are closer than anyone else-your most important relationship-who would that be ? If you had an hour , could you totally describe everything about this person ? If you had a day , could you describe everything you love and hate about them ? If you had a week , could you describe everything about that person 's history , relationships , passions , complexities , motivations , heart ? It seems that for our most important relationships , even a lifetime is not enough to learn everything about that person ; a lifetime is not enough for us to reveal ourselves entirely to any one person , no matter how much we love them and want to know them , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound lesson : the deeper your relationships to another person , the less you can ever capture them with words and the more they appear as mysterious . After all , it is only people we relate to superficially that we can describe in a few words and be done with it . Even more than our oldest friends who are mysterious to us , and as Catherine Mowry LaCugna emphasizes in her book God for Us ( Harper San Francisco , 1993 ) , God is mystery to us because God is always with each of us so personally : In the person of God the Father , creator of the universe , who fashioned every single tree that provided the paper on which you are reading this essay , and who loves every single person in the world with infinite depth . In the person of Jesus Christ , present in the flesh in our world , the Jesus who shed tears at the death of Lazarus , the Jesus who so freely spoke with women and lepers and tax collectors and others deemed religiously unclean or socially unworthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with oil by Mary , who enjoyed food and drink so freely that he was branded a glutton and a drunkard , who experienced the injustice of denigration , humiliation , and punishment from the state-enforced death penalty . In the person of the Holy Spirit , constantly aflame in our hearts , the Spirit who nurtures our growth in the divine image , the Spirit who shook the rafters at Pentecost , the Spirit who attends closely Pope John Paul II in his fragile body and vibrant heart . It 's the same Spirit who in Rosa Parks refused to move to the back of the bus . The late German theologian Father Karl Rahner , S.J. remarked that in the 21st century Christians will have to become mystics to remain Christians in any meaningful way . What needs to change in our lives before we honor the mystery of God present in all of life ? Before we dignify all of life : not just the wealthy or the healthy , but the stressful and the unsuccessful ; not just in our parking lots but in our parks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can afford a cell phone or a laptop , but those who stand with a cardboard sign at the intersection and ask for food and a confirmation of human dignity ? Taking radically seriously the mystery of God present in all of life has perhaps never been more difficult than it is today , because mystery , unlike almost every other aspect of our identity , can not be purchased , styled , accessorized , or exchanged . It is not produced by the poor in Latin America for a wealthy U.S. corporation . Only God has the copyright and the trademark on the mystery of all human life . 3 Be open to Learning about new names for God . Young Catholics are in a position to respect a diversity of names for the triune God , just as we are likely to accept diversity in friendships , school , and work relationships . Even when using the name " Father " to talk about the first person of the Trinity , many intuitively sense that of course God is not literally a Father . Many realize that for God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex or gender . Nor can God ever be restricted to one tradition or one culture . As absolute mystery , God can not be contained by any single name . And yet let us return to the closest relationships in our life . Is n't it true that even though we experience our oldest and closest friends as mysterious , we still give them nicknames ? In a similar , though sometimes more reverent way , we all give names to the God that we try to understand more fully , even though we will never fully understand our mysterious God . We most often refer to the Trinity as Father , Son , and Spirit . These are extremely important names for God as Trinity . But they are not the only ones . Too often Christians presume that the Trinity is literally male , a Trinity of three men circling somewhere out there in space . Even though many young Catholics do not believe this , they are often reluctant to speak of the triune God using any other names . In Christian tradition , God was first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a term of personal endearment , abba . God was also called Father because in the culture of the early church , fathers were thought to be the ones whose seed was solely responsible for the identity of the child . So if Jesus was the " son " of God , if Jesus somehow came " to " us " from " God , then God must be , in the ancient understanding , the " father " of Jesus . But we know now that procreation does n't quite work that way , and that mothers have as much to do with the child 's identity-if not more-than fathers . Even before we had this biological knowledge , Catholics over the past 2,000 years have addressed God with titles other than Father . Have we forgotten that just over 20 years ago , Pope John Paul I called God " mother " ? This is not just modern trendiness . The fourth-century Greek theologian Gregory of Nazianzus said that even the name " God " can not adequately express or capture or fully define who God is . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not wrap our minds around what is infinite . No single name is ever fully adequate to who God is . And so our tradition has given God many names . Elizabeth Johnson has catalogued some of these names in her book She Who Is ( Crossroad , 1993 ) , including one second-century theologian who imagined God as light-as a Trinity of sun , sunbeam , and point of light ; or God as water-as a Trinity of spring , river , and channel ; or God as plant-as a Trinity of root , stem , and flower . In the 11th century , theologian and mystic Hildegard of Bingen called the triune God a brightness , a flashing forth , and a fire . In our own day , Johnson names the Trinity as Holy Wisdom , Jesus Christ , and Spirit Sophia . Appreciating different names for the Trinity does not mean Catholics must simply accept every name that is proposed . There are some names for God that simply will not mesh with our experiences of being redeemed by this triune God , with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we really honor God as mysterious-and when we take seriously our identity as young mystics who will no longer try to box God into one religious tradition or one way of speaking-then we must always be open to the search for new names for our God . 4 Reach across differences to create communities and families where they did not previously exist To say that God is Trinity is to say that our God is a living relationship of three persons who are eternally there for each other . It also means that God cares deeply about our own relationships , our own " being there " for others , and understands more deeply than anyone else how important they are to us . Indeed , we could even say that the triune God is a community , or even a family , as Pope John Paul II has said . Our God is a family of three persons who are not self enclosed , isolated individuals . Rather , God is a family of three unique persons constantly reaching out to each other and to us . If God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church or people try to persuade us about God but do not offer us an experience of family , then they are not fully talking about God as Trinity . Every time we bring people together , every time we help to create family where it did not previously exist , reaching across the lines of black and white and brown and yellow and red , female and male , Catholic and Protestant and Jew and Muslim and Buddhist and Hindu , gay and lesbian and straight-every time we reach across those lines and create community , we are not only like the Trinity , we are indeed already a part of God 's very life here on earth . 5 Humbly relate to people of other religions . As young trinitarian mystics seeking to live a Trinity way of life , the more mysterious other people become to us and the more mysterious we allow God to be- and the more we admit that God 's family is the whole human race-the more we realize that we can not control who is " saved " and who is not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no explicit religious background at all . They should be encouraged to know that when they encounter these people , the Trinity way is to love them rather than to judge them ; the Trinity way is to learn from them rather than to badger them . At Vatican II , a generation ago , our church declared that we as Catholics reject nothing that is true in other major monotheistic religions . As Catholic Christians , who are beginning a new century of walking with this trinitarian God , we do not have the authority to say that God is not at work in our friends , schoolmates , and our fellow workers of other religions . This does not mean we should refrain from sharing our faith with others . Indeed , Pope John Paul II has said that we need a new Catholic evangelization of the world , to let people know of the power , the beauty , the goodness of Catholic Christianity . If we are a living trinitarian family , being God 's family to each other and to the world , others will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , our faith , the mystery at the center of our lives , our God . 6 Advocate for the well-being of others . Respecting the mystery of God in the salvation experiences of others does not mean simply letting the world be as it is . To live a trinitarian life is to always exist in relation to a community , to a family-and that means not just passive existence , but active work for the well-being of others in your family and community . It means advocating especially for those in trouble , those in danger , those at risk , those in need . This means that living a trinitarian life requires us to be politically active people . Every time you take responsibility for a relationship-whether a political relationship or a family or friend relationship  --  that is the triune God happening there . These experiences are not simply " like God , " or what the Trinity is " about . " These experiences are the very life of the Trinity moving in the depths of your life . As LaCugna reminds us , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . . impersonal . . . existence : the denial that we are persons from and for God , from and for others . " Thus political apathy is a sin , and it is a sin of which young Catholic generations are too often guilty . God as Trinity calls us to a life that unites the best of who young Catholics are today : not only spiritual seekers nurturing an interior life of mystery , but also serviceoriented workers who volunteer our lives for the world . 7 Commit yourself to reform issues in the Catholic Church . Political work should not be restricted to work outside the church . The community of the church is not optional for us ; it is one family for whom we are all responsible . We do not have to approve of everything this family does , but we each have a part to play in making sure it is as healthy as it can be . Many young Catholics are mindful that not all have an equal voice in the family of the church-especially women . The torch will soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change this . Our children may well ask us , a generation from now , what we did to make the church a better family , a more fitting home for God , a more welcoming home for all of us . Let us not be known as the generation that did not care enough to attend to our universal family , the church . If God as Holy Spirit is indeed personally present and alive in each of us , then we have a responsibility to bring our spiritual gifts and insights to our church , to reform the sin that still remains within it . Living a trinitarian life means we must be active laypeople , not passive . We must be critically faithful , not the church 's couch potatoes . We must be willing to think for ourselves , as adults , and not pretend that God is the big Pez dispenser in the sky who doles out little tablets of faith or grace or truth when we need it . God 's Holy Spirit is alive and present and stirring within all of us this very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient in listening to it . LaCugna put it bluntly : " Trinitarian life is also our life . " The doctrine of the Trinity is " not ultimately a teaching about God ' but a teaching about God 's life with us and our life with each other . . . God in us , we in God , all of us in each other . " Taking stock of what we each must do to live the Trinity more fully is our task as we begin a new century , a century that is thirsty for the creativity , vibrancy , hope , faith , and justice of young Catholics . Let this new century happen , and through the charisms of young Catholics , let the Trinity happen in it .
