President Bush changes the way federal judges are chosen , looking to ideology as a major factor in their selection . // TEXAS SUPREME COURT JUSTICE Priscilla Owen has friends in high placesWhite House Counsel Alberto R. Gonzales , once her colleague on the state 's highest court , and Bush advisor Karl Rove , who was intimately involved in her campaign when she first ran for election in 1994 . Perhaps that explains why President Bush recently renominated the ultraconservative to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit after the Senate Judiciary Committee defeated her nomination last September . In the old Senate , the Democrats had the clout to stop a nomination like Owen 's in its tracks . That 's much less likely to happen now , with Republicans controlling the Senate , albeit by a slim majority , 51-49 . With the GOP holding sway over both the legislative and executive branches , Bush is now positioned to make good on his campaign promise to appoint conservative judges in the mold of Supreme Court Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of picking judges-even making what ranking Democrat Senator Patrick Leahy called the " unprecedented " move of sending back rejected candidates like Owen and Charles Pickering of Mississippi for reconsideration . To be fair , each administration tries to put its stamp on the judiciary , and politics weigh heavily in the consideration of any nominee . Clinton 's appointments greatly increased diversity on the bench-close to half the people he named were minorities or women-but , centrist that he was , he had no interest in packing the court with ideologues , nor in the battles it would take to get a Republican-dominated Senate to confirm them . By contrast , the Republicans , beginning with Reagan , have hewed to a long-range plan to put farright jurists on the bench , and Owen certainly fills the bill . " It 's dismaying , " says legal ethicist and Stanford law professor Deborah L. Rhode . " Her distinctive qualification from this administration 's point of view appears to be her strong ideological bias . " Traditionally , objections such as Rhode 's are seen as playing politics or beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to place whoever it wants on the bench ? At least , that 's what the Republicans argue . But Rhode disagrees . " These are lifetime appointments whose influence will be felt long after this administration is gone . We have a right to expect mainstream candidates who represent all of us , not just a particular constituency . " Actually , the demand for centrism goes to the very heart of judicial temperament , says Sheldon Goldman , author of Picking Federal Judges ( Yale University Press , 1997 ) and a professor of political science at University of Massachusetts at Amherst . " Judges are supposed to be neutral arbiters of the law . If they want to be advocates , they should n't be judges , " he says . By that standard , Owen is manifestly unfit for office . A formidable opponent of abortion rights , she has never allowed a minor seeking an abortion to obtain a judicial bypass of the parental consent requirement . Indeed , she has tried to toughen the standards so greatly that even Gonzales , while on the Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for " unconscionable " judicial activism . Her record in age discrimination cases is equally hard-line : If she had her way , it would be impossible to bring an age discrimination claim unless that was the only plausible reason for dismissal . " That means if someone came to work five minutes late , he does n't have a case , " says Houston employment lawyer Margaret A. Harris . The opposition to Owen 's candidacy reaches deep into the heart of Texas . A statewide coalition of consumer and pro-choice groups there has worked feverishly to educate the public on her record , notes coordinator Craig McDonald , executive director of Texans for Public Justice , a public-interest group based in Austin . Now , with Owen 's confirmation all but inevitable , her opponents are waxing philosophical . " Some people say our strategy is wrongheaded because if we succeed , she stays on the state supreme court , " says McDonald . " We lose both ways . " Oddly enough , when Bush was governor , his appointments to the Texas Supreme Court included a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he was n't under pressure to placate a far-right base . " Similarly , Bush had a brief flirtation with bipartisanship early in his term when he included two African-American Democrats-Roger Gregory and Barrington Parker , Jr. - in his first slate of nominees to the federal bench . Gregory-the first black appeals judge in the Fourth Circuit-was an interim appointment made by Clinton at the end of his term ; Parker had been a judge for the Southern District of New York since 1994 . Both were easily confirmed even though Republicans on the Senate judiciary Committee had failed to act on Gregory 's nomination when Clinton was in office . Goldman views the two nominations as " a peace offering meant to make hard-right nominees more palatable . " But it did n't quell the opposition and is n't likely to be tried again . By the same token , Bush wasted no time in ousting the American Bar Association 's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary from the nomination process as soon as he took office . Since 1953 , the committee has evaluated potential nominees for integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and interviews with colleagues . The nominees receive a rating of well qualified , qualified , or not qualified . Formerly , that process took place in consultation with the White House before the nomination was announced ; now it 's done after the fact as a service to the Senate Judiciary Committee . Bush explained his action as an end to special treatment for a special interest group . " The issue at hand , " wrote his right hand Gonzales , is " whether the ABA alone-out of the literally dozens of groups and many individuals who have a strong interest in the composition of the federal courts-should receive advance notice of the identities of potential nominees in order to render pre-nomination opinions on their fitness for judicial service . " That paean to evenhandedness , from a letter to then-ABA president Martha W. Barnett , ignores that the ABA is the largest legal organization in the country and that its scrutiny involves a peer-review process . While the ABA as a group has taken liberal positions in favor of abortion rights and a moratorium on the death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerations aside , says the committee 's current chair Carol E. Dinkins , who served in the Reagan justice department and was a Bush appointee during his tenure as governor . " Ideology is not part of the evaluation at all-that has always been the case , " says Dinkins . Incidentally , Owen was found to be well qualified . THE CASE OF CAROLYN KUHL Another major procedural change is the attempt to limit the veto power of Democratic senators from the nominee 's home state . Previously , if the opposition party 's home-state senators did not support the nomination , it would die in committee . Not any more . Senator Barbara Boxer ( D-CA ) has been a vocal critic of Carolyn Kuhl , a state court judge who was nominated for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit . In another era , Kuhl would have been dead in the water , but she too has been renominated and is likely to win confirmation . Boxer has explained her opposition in detail . " Her record is filled with examples of her advocating for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter to the Recorder , a San Francisco legal newspaper . As a young attorney in the Reagan justice department , Kuhl wrote memos urging the overturning of Roe v. Wade . When in private practice , she wrote a friend-ofthe-court brief urging that counselors in federally funded planning services be barred from even mentioning abortion . As a Los Angeles County trial judge , Kuhl wrote an opinion that surpasses even these in its disregard for privacy rights , ruling that bringing a drug company salesman into the room when a cancer patient was having her breasts examined-without letting her know that he was n't a physician-was not intrusive enough to violate her privacy . Kuhl , who has been rated well qualified by the ABA , was reversed by the California Court of Appeal , which tartly observed : " A breast cancer patient who goes into an oncologist 's office to be examined does not , nor should she , take a risk that ... a drug salesperson will be a part of the process .... " Boxer stated in her letter that she wrote the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuit court judges and who would have my full support . Those suggestions have been ignored , although the Constitution demands that the Senate have advice and consent role on judges , a provision that I take very seriously . " Along with Kuhl and Owen , Ohio Supreme Court Justice Deborah Cook also has been renominated for the Federal Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit . The prospect of her deciding federal discrimination cases has galvanized local plaintiffs ' lawyers . A study of her record found she has ruled in favor of employers 83 percent of the time , says Frederick Gittes , president of the National Employment Lawyers Association . " Her hostile and extreme views concerning laws governing the workplace have no place on the federal bench , " he says . LOOKING BEYOND GENDER To those who say that feminists ought to be heartened to have gender representation on the bench even if they 're getting Scalia in a skirt , Isabelle Katz Pinzler , Special Counsel to the NOW Legal and Educational Fund , has an answer : " I would rather have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of how they 're going to decide cases , " she says . " Diversity is important , but it 's not the only consideration . " Ultimately , if you 're offering up judges that look like America but think like Wall Street , you 're playing fast and loose with democracy . " If courts are perceived as being governed by political ideology , they lose public support and are no longer seen as an independent branch of government , " says Goldman . " They 're just an arm of the regime . " Unfortunately , that seems to be what the current regime is after . Author Affiliation The work of Chicago-based writer Stephanie B.

I loved it on sight and dreamed of getting lost there , a fantasy that haunts me still . <p> As special guests , our wooden chairs had been placed on a small dais in the center of tiny Parque Santa Lucfa . Sitting in the front row , making notes , I watched couples dance on an improvised stage . Dark-suited men darted like moths . Women in white whirled coquettishly , trays of champagne glasses delicately balanced on their heads . <p> I knew about balancing acts , have gotten good at them . Not now , not tonight , I pleaded to  --  to whom ? Ixchel ; this was her territory . I want to have fun tonight , I told the Mayan moon goddess . This is my time . <p> Leaning back , I fluttered a sandalwood fan against the sultry night , savoring the quaint old park with its graceful archways and lush plantings . The mariachi band sounded great : horns , violins , lots of guitars . When lightning sliced the sky I sat up with a start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discernable . Thunder crashed above me now . How quickly the weather changes in Yucatn . The first , fast drops of rain pelted my hair , splashed my face . Companions were already up and running . Behind us was a narrow street , beyond that our hotel . Two group members were halfway there , our leader shepherding the rest across deepening rivulets of rainwater . <p> I turned back to the stage and saw male dancers scatter in all directions . The women performers , gowns sodden now and clinging , looked uncertainly at one another , hands raised to trays still balanced on their heads . A goblet slid off , shattering on ancient paving stones . Mariachis grabbed their instruments and ran from the bandstand . Thunder crashed again , long and ominous . <p> Another fiery bolt slashed the horizon . " Sage , are you coming ? " someone called to me from across the street . Hesitating , I looked again at the hotel , considered my fellow travelers , and remembered their twice-told tales . So tedious . Lost luggage in Guadalajara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite direction . The mariachis were disappearing into a cantina on the far side of the square . El Troubabor . Liking the sound of it , I hurried toward the blinking Christmas tree lights that marked the bar 's lofty stone entryway . My high heels slipped on rough stones . An experienced traveler should have known better , but I could n't resist the slinky shoes waiting so long in my closet . <p> Pushing open the elaborately carved wooden door , I rushed inside , glad to be out of the rain , a smooth marble floor beneath my feet . Too smooth . I slid , missed a step , and pitched forward into the dark , smoky room . An awful moment , tumbling in slow motion . I fell headlong , or would have , if a stranger 's arms had n't reached out and caught me . For the tiniest moment I relaxed against his shoulder . . . . How good it felt to be held without being needed . How long had it been ? <p> " Are you all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked a little younger than me , early forties , perhaps ; tall , rangy , and smiling softly . I 'd never seen him before , yet felt in some crazy way that I knew him , might even have been waiting for him . <p> " I 'm fine . " I stepped back , wobbly , embarrassed . The room was filled with people , all of them looking at us . " Thank you , " I gasped . <p> " Come , join me . " He gestured toward the ornate mahogany bar where his drink waited , something dark and sparkling in a snifter . <p> Still shaky , I settled onto a bamboo stool , its back thickly padded with embroidered pillows . Mayan designs : Ixchel , my favorite , alongside ferocious snouts and plumed serpents . <p> My reflection stared back from the cloudy mirror behind the bar . Wide eyes , wary like a startled cat . I took off my scarf , fluffed up the short silver waves its silken whimsy had failed to cover . Good haircuts are hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " +Una margarita , seora ? " the bartender asked , his ring-heavy hands already busy pouring . <p> " Sf , por favor . " <p> " You speak Spanish ? " the man beside me asked . <p> " Espaol por tontos . " <p> " +Tontos ? " <p> " Dummies  --  it gets me by . " <p> The mariachis , grouped in a corner , tuned up instruments that seemed none the worse for the shower . Much of the brass was dented , the tuba tarnished , but the brave sound raised my spirits immediately . Tasting the salt from the glass 's rim , I looked about the cantina : intimate , heavy with history ; faded elegance , but still inviting . This was the colonial part of town , the adobe walls a good five hundred years old . I liked the ancient grillwork at the windows , the bright woven rugs scattered across the tile floor . <p> Studying the faded photographs on the wall beside me , I saw poignant reminders of Mexico 's turbulent past . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with broad sombreros , bandoliers bristling with bullets , rifles ready . Young , unformed faces with fierce dark eyes . I picked up a bar napkin , jotted a few hurried notes , and looked up to see my rescuer watching me . <p> " This is a nice place to remember , " he nodded . One eyelid seemed a little heavier than the other , slightly engaging , a wink waiting to happen . " The mariachis end up here nearly every night to play their own favorites . Will you be in town long ? " <p> I shook my head . " No . Here today , Chichen Itza tomorrow , then Cancn ; finally , Campeche . " <p> " Oh , you 're on a tour . " <p> " Sort of . I 'm the person who gets people to want to take tours . Now , is that a good thing ? " I swirled the liquid in my glass . " I wonder sometimes . " <p> When he looked puzzled , I explained : " I 'm a travel writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Actually , I thought , he was rather romantic . Dark blue eyes , penetrating ; slim hips ready for the ghost of a gun belt . <p> He nodded at the wall of photographs that I 'd been examining . " You consider revolutionaries romantic ? " <p> <br> Continues ...
