<p> They are dressed in matching black suits , black shoes , black hats , yellow socks , yellow shirts and skinny ties . They are sitting on the hood of a police cruiser holding five-foot baseball bats , their eyes disguised by identical black sunglasses . <p> Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire looked like buddies in this poster from 1988 . They were supposed to look like brothers , too . McGwire and Canseco were nicknamed the Bash Brothers , so the marketers outfitted them to look like bigger , meaner Blues Brothers who favored a dash of yellow in their wardrobes . <p> The poster is obsolete , and the relationship between Canseco and McGwire is , too . They were never that friendly while bashing their forearms together for the Oakland Athletics after home runs , but they were civil to each other . Any shred of civility has vanished . <p> When Canseco appears on " 60 Minutes " tonight , he will make statements about McGwire and steroids use . Canseco is promoting his new book , " Juiced : Wild Times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big , " and he will sit in front of Mike Wallace and assert that he and McGwire used steroids while playing for the A 's and that he even injected McGwire with them . <p> Although Canseco links other marquee players to performance-enhancing steroids , his prime target is McGwire . They played together for seven seasons in Oakland and helped the A 's win a World Series title in 1989 . Now , Canseco is accusing McGwire of using illegal steroids , something Canseco admits he did throughout a once-superb career . <p> " Canseco has made it really personal with Mark , " said Tony La Russa , who managed them with the A 's . " It 's inaccurate . It 's unfair . It 's not right . " <p> Are Canseco 's charges inaccurate , unfair and incorrect ? McGwire did not respond to requests to interview him , but Canseco has put him and other former teammates  --  Jason Giambi , Ivan Rodriguez , Juan Gonzalez and Rafael Palmeiro  --  in an uncomfortable position with his assertions , true or untrue , embellished or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's credibility is questionable : he once threatened to sue a reporter who connected him to steroids . But Canseco spent several seasons in the same clubhouse with these players and has vast knowledge of performance-enhancing drugs . <p> Since McGwire admitted in 1998 to using androstenedione , a precursor to steroids that was allowed by the major leagues at the time , there have been questions whether he used steroids . Major League Baseball did not institute a drug-testing policy until after he retired in 2001 . McGwire has a much leaner physique as a retiree ; Canseco , who also last played in the majors in 2001 , still looks bulked up . <p> " I 'm starting to think that maybe Jose has something wrong with him , " said Dave McKay , who coached Canseco and McGwire with the A 's . " He 'd tell you a story and you 'd know he was making up , and he 'd know it , too . A couple of months later , he 'd tell it again and he believed it . You 'd tell him it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe he believes he injected Mark McGwire . " <p> Still , Dave Stewart , a former teammate of McGwire 's and Canseco 's with the A 's , told The San Francisco Chronicle that steroid users are usually able to identify the players who are doing what they are doing . <p> " I could never say Josey is a liar , " Stewart said . " I do n't like his work ethic , and I do n't like him as a teammate . But one thing I ca n't say about him is he 's a liar . " <p> Canseco and McGwire have taken divergent paths since they were at least friendly enough to dress up like oversized mannequins for the poster . McGwire finished with 583 home runs in a probable Hall of Fame career ; in retirement , he has stayed out of the public eye and spends countless days on the golf course near his home in Orange County , Calif . He has a zero handicap and has distant hopes of playing professionally some day . <p> Canseco , who also lives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He limped to the end of his career and accused teams of blackballing him after he could not find a job , falling 38 homers short of 500 . He was put under house arrest after a brawl in a nightclub in 2001 , then he charged fans $625 an hour to hang out with him . He recently hocked his American League Most Valuable Player award for $30,000 . <p> Because of the book , Canseco and McGwire have crossed paths again . <p> La Russa , who now manages the St. Louis Cardinals , said McGwire was angry with Canseco , but La Russa added that McGwire was in a dicey position . If McGwire responds to Canseco 's book , he could give credence to Canseco 's words . If McGwire stays quiet , the suspicions about him , heightened by the book , will linger . <p> La Russa and McKay , who supervised the Oakland workouts , said McGwire never mentioned steroids to them . They said he was so diligent about his workout regimen , even about which protein shake he would drink , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> La Russa emphasized that Canseco and McGwire were not close friends , saying McGwire would not have shared a syringe with someone he never shared lunch with . <p> La Russa said doing something that intimate would be like two players deciding to " have a drink before the game or smoke a joint . " <p> " Mark did n't have that kind of relationship with the guy , " La Russa said . <p> Walt Jocketty , who was then the assistant general manager of the A 's and is now the general manager of the Cardinals , agreed , saying Canseco " did n't have any friends " on the A 's . <p> As La Russa reflects on nine years of managing the A 's , he said he " could count on one hand " the number of players he suspected had used steroids and that " it would n't be all the fingers . " Other than Canseco , La Russa declined to say which A 's fit the profile of a steroid user . <p> Canseco had superior talent to McGwire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in batting practice . La Russa said Canseco was the better player in 1988 , when he won the M.V.P. award . <p> But La Russa said Canseco changed after signing a five-year , $23.5 million contract , the biggest in baseball in 1990 , and was not interested in working to remain such a tremendous player . <p> " He quit working , " La Russa said . " He quit caring . " <p> While Canseco was an intelligent , charming fellow who La Russa said was " fun to be around , " McGwire was brooding and reserved . Canseco adored attention as a player and still embraces it . McGwire did not enjoy the glare that his achievements brought , and he surely dislikes the scrutiny he is under now . <p> La Russa said those stark personality differences were another reason that McGwire and Canseco never grew chummy . And those traits , one player who desires the spotlight and one player who despises it , are evidenced again . <p> When Canseco was reached on his cellphone last week , he politely declined to comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent , said Canseco had major plans that included performing in a music video . That will probably not get Canseco featured on another poster , nor on " 60 Minutes .
