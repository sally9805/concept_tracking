<p> China 's central bank declared Tuesday that last week 's slight increase in the value of the country 's currency , the yuan , was a one-time event and not the beginning of a gradual climb , as officials sought to diminish speculative pressures for a substantial revaluation . <p> In a " solemn statement , " the People 's Bank of China said the policy shift last Thursday was primarily aimed at changing how China sets the exchange rate for the yuan  --  also known as the renminbi , or RMB  --  by severing its direct link to the U.S. dollar , and not a signal of any willingness to allow its value to float upward . <p> " Certain foreign media have misled the public and even wrongly speculated that the revaluation of the RMB by two percent was only the first step in a series of adjustments , " the bank said . Its action last week " does not in the least imply an initial move which warrants further actions in the future . " <p> Analysts said China 's central bank was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preempt capital from flooding into the country to bet on another increase in the value of the yuan . As China 's leaders are well aware , speculators played a key role in overwhelming Thailand 's fixed currency regime in 1997 , forcing the central bank to devalue and triggering a broader Asian financial crisis . <p> Given such concerns , China 's leaders could be bluffing , seeking to keep speculators off balance while it prepares another revaluation  --  which some analysts and traders still expect . But economists close to China 's central government said the warning from bank officials probably reflects genuine intentions : China chose not to increase the value of the yuan significantly , but has simply introduced a little extra flexibility in its day-to-day movements  --  the first step in a process that could take as long as a decade before Beijing fully frees its currency to rise and fall according to global markets . <p> " We are not going to expect any one single great leap in currency appreciation in the future , " said Ha Jiming , chief economist at China International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country 's major state-owned lenders , Construction Bank of China . " As the central bank has repeatedly emphasized , the currency revaluation move is more about reforming the exchange-rate mechanism than changing the exchange rate itself . " <p> If the central bank 's latest pronouncement does reflect policy , it could reinvigorate trade friction with the United States and other trading partners . The Bush administration has for more than two years pressured China to allow the value of its currency to float upward , arguing that a low-priced yuan makes Chinese-made goods unfairly cheap on world markets . <p> The White House commended China 's slight revaluation . It was also praised by Sen. Charles E. Schumer ( D-N.Y ) , who has been pressing a bill that would impose 27.5 percent punitive tariffs on Chinese goods if Beijing does not substantially increase the value of its currency . <p> Schumer was less effusive Tuesday . " While the Chinese Central Bank has said that they will not do another fixed valuation in the near future , we trust that the Chinese will allow market forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We will be carefully monitoring this process over the next few months . " <p> Chinese analysts on Tuesday said anyone expecting another increase soon would be frustrated . <p> " China will not revalue the renminbi again in coming months , " said Song Guoqing , an economist at the China Center for Economic Research at Beijing University . <p> As the central bank outlined its policy shift last week , some commentators and U.S. officials indicated that it could be the beginning of a gradual but significant series of increases in the yuan 's value . Some suggested that it might increase the prices of goods made here , diminishing the U.S. appetite for Chinese products and cutting into the $162 billion U.S. trade deficit with China . Others said a stronger yuan might curb China 's voracious buying of dollars in support of its exchange rate . That could limit China 's purchases of U.S. Treasury bills , perhaps resulting in higher interest rates that could pop the U.S. real estate market . <p> But the word from China 's central bank on Tuesday reinforced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make too much of the slight change in how Beijing values its money . <p> " Simply put , we do n't see any effect whatsoever of a 2 percent revaluation on exports or imports , " Jonathan Anderson , chief economist at UBS Investment Research in Hong Kong , wrote in a recent note to investors . Anderson , who has been among the more accurate China watchers in recent months , wrote that it was " hard to see any effect at all " on U.S. consumers and manufacturers , or on China 's rate of economic growth . <p> Even a larger shift in the value of the yuan would probably have little impact on U.S. manufacturers , because most of China 's export growth is in products that have not been made in the United States in large scale in many years . Chinese workers who once earned $1 an hour will now make $1.02  --  hardly an equation that will prompt U.S. factories to dive back into the labor-intensive work of making toys , T-shirts and furniture . <p> Chinese officials have tried to deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further revaluation . <p> " China 's exchange rate reform wo n't have too much influence on U.S. deficits , " China 's central bank governor , Zhou Xiaochuan , said over the weekend . <p> Those anticipating a significant readjustment and change in the global economy have focused on how the central bank said it would now determine the exchange rate . In place of the fixed peg to the dollar , China said it would link the yuan to a basket of currencies while allowing daily trading within 0.3 percent of the previous day 's closing price . <p> Some analysts construed that to mean that the currency might float up by 0.3 percent each day , increasing by as much as 3 percent over 10 days . Others speculated that the shift to the basket would mean that China would sell significant holdings of dollars as it added euros and Japanese yen , altering the prices of all three currencies and reducing demand for U.S. bonds . <p> But Chinese analysts said such expectations were based on a fundamental misreading of the new system and the intentions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure that there are no shocks to the system . China has yet to say what other currencies will make up its new basket and how their values will be linked to the yuan 's  --  information that many analysts assume will never be disclosed , to keep speculators off guard . <p> The new system gives China 's leaders the ability to set the yuan 's currency however they like , without disclosing their rationale . Far from a mathematic formula , the new exchange rate is a kind of guideline that the central bank can use at its discretion , analysts said . <p> " The media has been overreacting on the currency issue , " said Zhang Liqun , an economist at the Development Research Center in Beijing , a think tank attached to China 's State Council . " The central bank has adopted an opaque method on currency management . It 's going to operate within a black box , which will be very difficult to grasp . " <p> The strongest message China 's central bank has delivered has been heard in the currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the announcement , China 's currency was worth 8.11 to the dollar . On Tuesday , it was at 8.1099 , according to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange . <p> Staff writer Paul Blustein contributed to this report from Washington .
