<p> In a nation of growing red or blue allegiances , the media too are beginning to take on more overtly partisan hues . And it may be reinforcing the political cleavage in the country . <p> The selective perspectives are evident from coastal lobster-trap country to the land of longhorn cattle . <p> Up in Bar Harbor , Maine , Michael Boland works overtime during the summer feeding the locals and tourists that crowd into his restaurant , Rupununi 's . But no matter how busy he is , he tries to disappear every afternoon at 4:30 so he can head to his office upstairs and tune in to " Democracy Now " on the radio - an unabashedly left-of-center analysis of the day 's events . <p> " I rely on it for my progressive take on the news , " he says . <p> Down in Schertz , Texas , Stace Cunningham is just as determined to get a spin he 's comfortable with . He spends most days in his lab , where he 's got 15 computers for his work as a security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one computer set to www.NRAnews.com , a website operated by the National Rifle Association , so he can hear an assessment of the world that he believes is truly fair - particularly where gun issues are concerned . <p> " The show is a breath of fresh air , " he says . <p> From the conservative Fox News Channel to the liberal radio startup Air America to political blogs of every philosophical stripe , Americans can now pick and choose a news source to fit their ideological bent . Even the big screen , these days , offers up politically charged fare - most notably with Michael Moore 's " Farehnheit 9/11 . " <p> The trend toward partisanship in the media , though nascent , has many political experts worried . If everyone simply reads or listens to news that reinforces their own opinions , there may be less room for compromise - a key foundation of this nation 's government . An already polarized country could become even more deeply divided at every level . Already , stories of friends or relatives who can no longer talk politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fare . Signs of the times include caustic political humor and candidates tossing profanities at the other party . <p> While others admit the growing politicization of news does create potential problems , they instead see the emergence of new sources of information as a welcome expansion of the nation 's political dialogue . To them , the high-voltage talk shows and websites are signs of a public increasingly engaged on important issues - from Iraq to the role of religion in society . <p> Indeed , most Americans who tune into these alternative sources still tap into mainstream media as well . In addition to listening to " Democracy Now , " Mr. Boland reads three newspapers a day . And Mr. Cunningham looks forward to the NRA 's Cam &; Company show so he can compare it with what he sees on the nightly news . <p> " For democracy , the thing you worry about is a world in which people do n't get exposure to the other side , " says Kathleen Hall Jamieson , director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> How , and why , viewing habits are changing <p> Still , there is evidence that the media-browsing public is getting more partisan right alongside the press . <p> A recent Pew Research Center study found that since 2000 , the number of Americans who say they watch Fox News Channel regularly jumped from 17 percent to 25 percent , and most of those new viewers describe themselves as " politically conservative . " Struggling against an apparent Republican-viewer revolt , Fox rival CNN has managed to draw in a growing number of Democratic-leaning viewers . <p> The trend is driven by several factors - some originating with the news outlets and others rooted in the public at large . <p> On a basic level , more-opinionated news is what the public seems to want in this so-called 50/50 nation , with feelings fanned by battles over the Iraq war , gay marriage , and the Florida recount of the 2000 election . Many see the media as biased and are looking for other sources . <p> The trend also reflects top-down efforts by both sides to galvanize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as talk radio 's Rush Limbaugh a decade ago , Al Franken 's Air America radio program is now offering a sharp-edged brand of liberal commentary . And a younger generation is " blogging , " creating their own media with like minded people on the Web . Recent limits on political donations have also driven some organizations to try to get their messages out via traditional media . Most notably , the NRA is looking beyond its new radio show toward the possibility of buying a broadcast network . <p> Technology has also played a role , as TV 's once-limited dial has expanded to hundreds of channels , and anyone with a computer is a potential Thomas Paine . <p> Some analysts think media companies are biased less toward the ideological than the sensational - that which sells papers and causes people to tune in . It 's staying in business , not ideology , that motivates most newspapers . <p> Whatever the reasons , the rise of opinionated journalism appears to have taken a toll on media credibility . In 1987 , 58 percent of Americans said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the People and the Press . Today , 36 percent say they find that kind of balance when they tune in or pick up a paper . <p> Extreme media ? Not like it used to be <p> Still , the nation 's news outlets are nowhere near as blatantly political as they were during the country 's first 150 years . Publishers such as Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst used their papers to express their own agendas , and those crusades often colored the truth . <p> Even Thomas Jefferson , one of America 's greatest champions of a free press , saw the media 's darker side . " Nothing can now be believed which is seen in a newspaper , " he wrote to John Norvell in 1807 while president . " Truth itself becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle . " <p> Today , by contrast , experts say the media 's more boisterous partisans are still the exception , not the rule . While many of America 's liberal voters thoroughly enjoyed Michael Moore 's movie , they 'll spend considerably more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where 1 in 5 conservatives say they listen to Mr. Limbaugh or Bill O'Reilly Factor on Fox , 61 percent read a daily newspaper , according to a Pew survey . <p> Beyond that , no matter what views are being espoused by media opiners , many of them still get their basic news from services like the Associated Press , says Tom Rosenstiel , director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism in Washington . He does n't believe the trend toward partisanship will infect the whole media , in part , because most local cities and towns have only one newspaper , and that paper is dependent on advertisers . So it 's in their best interest to be as objective as possible . <p> But consumers are more particular about the lens through which they get their information . Cam Edwards , the host of the NRA 's Cam &; Company , thinks he knows why conservatives are so skeptical and quickly to turn to alternative sources like his show . " If The New York Times or The Washington Post would cover things without leaving out pertinent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . " Our listeners can rely on us to give them factual information that they 're not getting elsewhere . " <p> Stace Cunningham agrees , which is why he has n't missed a day since he discovered NRA News on the Web . " For several years , I 've felt that what I 've heard on the news channels was always tilted toward the very liberal side , and I 'm smart enough to figure out there are always two sides to every story , " he says . " Take firearms , for example . I 've seen plenty of good defensive uses and plenty of bad stuff , but the only thing that gets reported is the bad stuff : You never see when someone saved themselves from getting raped or robbed . " <p> And up in Maine , Michael Boland could n't disagree more about the bent of the mainstream press . He thinks it leans toward the middle to conservative - leaving out a truly liberal perspective . His primary source of information is The New York Times , which he sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public Radio , another source that is perceived by many as liberal , but he contends has gotten more conservative since the 1991 Gulf War . " For instance , they use the term terrorists to describe some groups that are clearly not terrorists : They 're freedom fighters or in a civil war , " he says . " I have an ability to read between the lines , but I also think it 's really important for us as a country to have good alternative sources of information . " <p> He would also like to see Air America - the liberals ' answer to Limbaugh - become more friendly and available to the " average Joe " just as Limbaugh has done . That 's some of what comedian and now co-host Janeane Garofalo is determined to do . She 's convinced the mainstream media are beholden to economically privileged interests and do n't represent most Americans . <p> " The ' liberal bias ' in the mainstream media is a neat trick ; it does not exist , " says Ms. Garofalo , cohost of " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement demands underdog status . It demands that its listeners , whether they 're listening to Fox or Limbaugh , are the underdogs fighting the good fight against this alleged media bias . " <p> The pitched battle for America 's hearts and minds may be intensifying - with skirmishes now in the courtroom as well as on the airwaves . The Democratic group MoveOn.org was scheduled to announce legal action Sunday challenging the Fox network 's use of " fair and balanced " as a slogan - a jab at what critics see as a blatant conservative bias on the network . <p> Some play referee <p> As liberals and conservatives clash more sharply , some Americans are taking things into their own hands to cut through the bloviation . People like Bryan Keefer . At age 21 , he was appalled by the vitriol on both sides of the 2000 election fray over Florida ballots . So he and some friends started spinsanity.com , a blog on the Internet that attempts to cull the wheat from the political chaff . The site took off , and is now a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonpartisan , we consider ourselves sort of the umpires , we call it as we see it , " he says . They 've taken on both Michael Moore 's innuendo in " Fahrenheit 9/11 " and George W. Bush 's selective use of facts - what Mr. Keefer calls the " strategically dishonest talking points . " <p> Every week now in the Philadelphia Inquirer , Spinsanity has a column critiquing two claims , one from the left and one from the right . " We 're holding everyone accountable , " says Keefer , who is now also the assistant managing editor of CampaignDesk.org , which is run by the Columbia Journalism Review . <p> Indeed , the public in general likes to see issues debated , rather than spun , in the media , according to a recent Pew study . And not everyone sees the American media going to ruin . Despite all of their failings and biases - liberal , corporate , or conservative - news organizations still maintain independent voices that are accessible , regardless of political leanings . <p> " The American media is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world - an institution that provides an independent voice is very rare : hard to build , easy to destroy , and hard to rebuild , " says Robert Lichter of the Center on Media and Public Affairs . " But you know , the republic did survive for 150 years with a partisan one .
