<p> Cary Stayner was sentenced Thursday to die for committing three murders near Yosemite National Park in 1999 . For FBI agent Jeff Rinek , it was the climax of a case that took a momentous turn on July 24 , 1999 . On that day , Rinek , who had thought his career was all but over , would find vindication - and compassion for the man inside the monster .. The call was damned inconvenient . <p> FBI agent Jeff Rinek was used to getting pulled away from home on Saturdays . But this weekend the boys were away . He and Lori had the house to themselves . For 15 years , she had put up with him working odd hours on cases too horrible to imagine . <p> Now the bureau wanted him to pick up some guy named Cary Stayner - a possible material witness to a murder - at a nudist resort in Wilton . It was n't Rinek 's case . His office just needed a driver . <p> All he knew was that three days earlier , on July 21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed . Yosemite was a sore spot for Rinek . In February , he was removed as lead agent on an investigation involving three slain Yosemite tourists . It had been a humiliating experience - one that had deeply shaken Rinek 's faith in the bureau . <p> As Rinek showered , put on a pair of jeans and a T-shirt , it did n't seem possible that the earlier case and this recent killing could be related . He kissed Lori goodbye . He was amazed his wife tolerated all the extra hours he put in . Yet she always did . <p> He had missed countless special occasions - anniversaries , family parties . When a chase through Sacramento kept him from making his wife 's 37th birthday party , Rinek dialed Lori on his cell phone and made the suspect apologize to her for interfering with their plans . <p> Stunts like that made Rinek popular among the other agents , but not among his bosses . He was a little too coarse for the bureau 's buttoned-down supervisors . He used profanity and had once been written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was dinged for insubordination , and got into a few too many faces a few too many times . <p> At 47 , he was a little more than two years away from early retirement . He figured the top brass would be happy if he took it . And he would n't miss them a bit . It was a shame , though . He liked the work . <p> Winding down his narrow driveway in his FBI-issued Ford , he wondered whether there was any way he could get this over with quickly and salvage the rest of the day . <p> Rinek chose the back roads , not the highway , from his house , 40 miles east of Sacramento . Some might call it poetic that the town he lived in was called Rescue . Rinek 's specialty was rescuing children . <p> He kept a heavy foot on the gas pedal during the 50-mile drive to Wilton . When he got to Laguna Del Sol , the resort 's manager was waiting for him at the gate . Two other agents and two Sacramento sheriff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a nudist camp . He scanned the gathering naked crowd , but was disappointed with what he saw . The women were mostly out of shape . <p> He and John Boles , a cocky young agent , were directed to the resort 's restaurant . Stayner was inside eating breakfast . Rinek , like most people in the area , knew of the Stayner family . Stayner 's younger brother , Steven , made national headlines in 1980 , after he escaped from his abductor , Kenneth Parnell , a convicted child molester . <p> Steven was held and sexually abused by Parnell for seven years after his kidnapping in 1972 . His story had been chronicled in a book and dramatized in a television miniseries . And after surviving a hellish childhood of abuse , Steven died in a motorcycle crash in 1989 . <p> Rinek wanted to talk to Stayner about his brother . The bureau wanted to talk to him about the Yosemite murder . Rinek thought Stayner might have been a former boyfriend of the victim . <p> When he and the other investigators walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above his head . They thought it was a little strange . So Boles handcuffed him as a precaution . <p> Some of the patrons in the restaurant were nude , but Stayner was wearing shorts , a short-sleeved shirt and baseball cap . At 37 , he was a good-looking guy : tall , well-built , rugged . <p> " You ever see the movie " Billy Jack ' ? " Rinek asked him as they walked toward his car . " You look just like him . " <p> Stayner said he 'd never seen the 1971 film , and they kept walking . <p> " No kidding , " Rinek said . " I do n't know why we 're here . They want us to interview you . Would you be willing to be interviewed here or back at the office ? " <p> " Back at the office , " Stayner responded . <p> Rinek opened the car door and Stayner got in . The two men sat there for a while in silence . The crowd of gapers was moving closer , so Rinek figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned out to be more than a witness . <p> " I 'm going to read you your rights now , " Rinek told him . <p> To the agent , it was just routine . <p> It would turn out that Rinek had spent his whole life preparing for this day , this case , this man . <p> Rinek turned the key in the ignition and with Stayner 's guidance left the nudist camp , found his way to Highway 99 and headed north . Boles followed in another car . <p> The 40-minute drive to FBI headquarters in Sacramento turned into 90 minutes because of road construction . But the delay was fortuitous . There was something about Rinek that made Stayner relax - and talk . People were often caught off guard by the agent . He had the body of a wrestler , the bushy mustache of the Marlboro man , but the spirituality of a clergyman . He took confessions , and people seemed to want to give them to him . <p> So when the agent said , " Tell me about your brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that started 27 years ago . <p> His little brother , Steven , then 7 , had been walking home from Charles Wright Elementary School in Merced just a few weeks before Christmas . Parnell , posing as a church minister , offered to give Stevie a ride home and the second-grader accepted . <p> But Parnell would never stop at the Stayner home . Instead , he drove all the way to Cathy 's Valley , about 40 miles away . There , Parnell , accomplice Ervin Edward Murphy and Stevie holed up in a little red cabin . Parnell renamed Steven " Dennis , " and for the next seven years he passed the boy off as his son by day and used him for sex at night . <p> When Stevie was 14 , Parnell kidnapped and brought home 5-year-old Timmy White . Steven wanted to save Timmy , so he summoned up enough courage to escape . The two hitchhiked from Manchester , a tiny coastal town in Mendocino County , into Ukiah , where they walked to the police station . <p> Cary Stayner was 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a camping trip at Yosemite when he heard the news of Stevie 's escape on the radio . By the time he got to Merced , news crews had taken over the small town . <p> Rinek asked him how he felt about the investigation into his brother 's disappearance . " Did law enforcement treat you and your family OK , and was there anything we could have done better ? " <p> Stayner got emotional and said he thought Parnell got off easy - he was only sentenced to seven years in prison for the kidnappings . He also voiced anger at the driver who killed his brother during the hit-and-run accident in 1989 . <p> Rinek listened to Stayner as he talked . He watched as his passenger 's eyes welled up with tears . He had seen that kind of sadness countless times in the family members of victims . And it still ripped his guts out . ONE OF THE GOOD GUYS <p> For almost as long as he could remember , Rinek dreamed of being an FBI agent . He remembered when agents showed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some mobbed-up guy was getting buried . The agents watched people coming and going and took pictures of license plates on parked cars . Rinek was drawn to the good guys in the bad suits , not the bad guys in the good suits . <p> After graduating from a small liberal arts school in Reading , Pa. , with a degree in history , Rinek was accepted into law school . But he could n't afford to go . So he took a job working as a clerk for the FBI in Washington , D.C. , and attended accounting classes at night . The FBI liked agents to be lawyers or accountants . <p> When he was 26 , the bureau offered him a job as a special agent . By 1980 , Rinek was transferred to New York City , where he worked on white-collar crime and foreign counterintelligence . <p> But the job was turning out to be a disappointment - a lot of tedious paperwork and not enough time in the field . <p> One good thing had happened , though . Rinek had met a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she was getting over a divorce . The pair started spending a lot of time together and married in 1984 on the back porch of the vintage farm house they had lovingly restored . <p> Three years later , their first son was born and they named him Joe . When Lori gave birth to their second boy , Jordan , life should have been wonderful for the couple . But Rinek was suffocating in the FBI 's New York office and Joe was very sick . <p> He was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome , a complex set of symptoms caused by renal diseases . The doctors prescribed medication that did n't help and the 3-year-old got worse . <p> About that time , Rinek was informed that he would finally be getting out of New York - a commitment of five years that had become 11 . There was an opening at the FBI 's Sacramento office . <p> So the Rineks packed up a moving truck , loaded the kids , three dogs and six cats in the car and drove west . They got as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency room . For the next week , they sat by Joe 's bedside and prayed he would n't die . <p> He pulled through and the family made it to Sacramento . But Joe 's health was still fragile and would be for several years to come . It made Rinek painfully aware that the young are so vulnerable , and their hold on life so tenuous . <p> LITTLE BOY LOST <p> Rinek found his true calling in 1993 . <p> That year two armed men pushed their way into Frankie Proctor 's Sacramento home , southeast of the Capitol . They locked Frankie 's parents in the bathroom , snatched the 7-month-old off the couch and fled . <p> Rinek and Sacramento police Detective Greg Stewart worked night and day on leads . As the hours passed , investigators held little hope of finding Frankie alive . Then they got a strange tip . It was from a less-than-reliable informant . The snitch said he knew a woman who had miscarried and desperately wanted a child of her own . He believed she stole Frankie . <p> Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gut feeling - the kind that comes from years on the street . The lead panned out , and a day later , Rinek clutched Frankie close to his heart . He could feel the baby 's strong pulse and hear his steady breathing . Surrounded by an army of cops with enough firepower to take down an entire city block , Rinek cried . First , the tears came for finding Frankie . <p> " We passed that baby around and around the room , " Rinek said . " We could n't stop holding him . " <p> Then he cried for his son Joe , who like Frankie seemed to be out of danger . <p> Rinek 's success in helping to solve the Proctor case elevated his status in the office . Soon he was specializing in child abduction cases . But finding Frankie was bigger than a promotion . He knew what he was meant to do - save children . <p> And sometimes he could . But not Michael Lyons . <p> The 8-year-old was found face down along the shore of the Feather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was May 17 , 1996 . His Batman shirt was covered in blood . Rinek thought Michael could just as easily be Joe or Jordan , his own young sons . <p> Michael had probably been dead for just a few hours when Rinek and investigators got there . A news helicopter buzzed overhead and a camera man tried to get footage of the scene . Rinek , a police detective and the county coroner all carried Michael under a canopy of trees in hopes of camouflaging him . <p> He remembered thinking : " Oh , God , do n't let this be the last image Michael 's mother has of her son . " <p> A half-mile away , authorities arrested Robert Boyd Rhoades , a repeat sex offender . The day before , Rhoades had grabbed Michael as he was walking home from Bridge Street Elementary School in Yuba City . He sodomized the boy and then stabbed him multiple times with a fishing knife . <p> Rinek had seen so much , and still he could n't imagine how someone could do this to a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed that man was capable of great evil . And the Old Testament provided an antidote : an eye for an eye . He wanted Rhoades to die - to suffer the way Michael had . IN THE PRESENCE OF EVIL <p> Stayner and Rinek continued to talk much of the way to FBI headquarters . Rinek found his passenger to be likable and intelligent . As they drove up to the FBI complex , Rinek noticed that the parking lot was nearly empty . Many of the agents were still at the murder scene in Yosemite , interviewing friends and family members of the victim . Before Rinek could put on his emergency brake , a smirking Stayner turned to him . <p> " You know what I think I 'm gon na do then ? " said Stayner , reciting exactly from " Billy Jack . " " Just for the hell of it ? I 'm gon na take this right foot , and I 'm gon na whop you on the side of your face and you wan na know something ? There 's not a damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " <p> " Well , I 'll be damned , " Rinek said . " You did see the movie . " <p> It was 84 degrees in Sacramento that day - cooler than usual for July . But the office felt like a sauna . Rinek was sweating and he had to use the bathroom . He left Stayner alone in a small office , while he relieved himself . Then he went to the lounge , where he rummaged through the candy bowl looking for chocolate . After devouring a candy bar , he and Boles prepared for the interview : setting up fingerprinting , mug shots , a lie detector test . <p> Before the polygrapher had time to set up his equipment , Stayner asked Rinek whether he could speak to him alone . Just the two of them . <p> With Boles out of the room , Stayner confided that he had been a bad person . He told the agent that he had been sexually abused at the hands of a relative when he was 11 years old . Stayner said his uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fondled him . He also confessed to Rinek that he 'd never had a normal relationship with a woman . And then Stayner dropped a bomb . <p> " I can give you closure , " he told the agent . <p> Rinek felt like someone had just poured ice cold water over his head . Unsure about what Stayner was talking about , Rinek waded in slowly . <p> " Closure about what ? " he asked . " You mean about what happened in Yosemite ? " <p> " And more , " Stayner responded . <p> " Like what more ? " Rinek continued . <p> Stayner answered , " Everything . " <p> Rinek could n't believe what he was hearing . <p> " Are you talking about the three women traveling in Yosemite - the Sund-Pelosso case ? " <p> Stayner nodded yes . <p> Suddenly Rinek needed air . <p> He left the interrogation room . He needed to clear his head and call Lori . He wanted to let her know that he would be late - very late . <p> When he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he whispered that he would never have to wear a jacket and tie again . He told her he was about to solve the biggest case of his career or completely screw it up . And he was scared . She did n't hear a word he said , but in verbal shorthand - the kind that goes on between couples - she said , " That 's great , honey . " <p> Meanwhile , Boles slipped back into the interrogation room and kept Stayner company . <p> " I guess you 've dealt with some really sick people in your day , " Stayner remarked to Boles as they waited for Rinek . A pepperoni pizza they had ordered sat on the table . <p> " I got ta eat , I 'm starved , " Rinek said to Boles and Stayner as he walked back into the room . <p> " This is gon na be my last pizza , " Stayner said . <p> " Stop that . Stop that , " Rinek chastised . He knew it was a risk to feed a suspect who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stayner needed to eat . <p> " If everything goes OK , we 're going to be here for a while , " Rinek told Stayner . " My goal would be to keep you here as long as I can and help you feel better . " <p> " And nothing does that like a pepperoni pizza , " Boles chimed in . <p> The three men ate and chatted about trivialities - rock climbing , movies , cars . Then Stayner got serious . <p> " Well , it is so weird , Jeff , " he said . " I love life so much . I can breathe , I can wake up and see the sun . I like my friends . I ca n't tell you why this happened . One minute I 'm thinking great thoughts and world peace and the next minute it is like I could kill every person on the face of the earth . " <p> Rinek could clearly see the dichotomy that was Cary Stayner . He believed he was in the presence of great evil . But he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now Rinek knew that Stayner had committed unspeakable acts against women . But he was persuaded that the man had a conscience - he could cry for his victimized brother and recoil at his own inner demons . <p> Rinek decided to channel the man who had sat in his car just hours earlier - not the bloodthirsty killer - to get Stayner 's confession . <p> " Today is the beginning of the rest of your life , " Rinek told him . " You are controlling you , probably for the first time since you were 11 . Do you know what the greatest harm to a child is when a child is abused ? That child tries to figure out what they did to cause this . . . . <p> " When you were 11 years old , something bad happened to you , and you 've been spending your life trying to live with it . Does your family know you have these tremendous internal issues ? " <p> " I have no idea , " Stayner answered . <p> " Have you told anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Never . " <p> " Well , do n't you think it 's time that we dealt with it now ? . . . Does n't mean you 're a bad person , it just means you 're a troubled person . " <p> Stayner appeared ready to confess , but then he waffled . He would tell Rinek things , but only if three conditions were met : He wanted to be housed in a federal penitentiary near his home town , to see his parents receive the reward money put up by the victims ' families . Then the doozy - he wanted a " good-size stack " of photographs and videotapes of child pornography . <p> " It 's very sick , I realize that , " Stayner said . " Maybe because I never got to see it , these ( killings ) happened . " <p> Rinek and Boles stalled him for a while , but in the end , they would say no to everything he wanted . Rinek could offer him only one thing : an opportunity to repent . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're done ? " Rinek asked . " You are gon na feel a lot of relief . . . you 're gon na feel peaceful , a feeling you have n't had in a long time . " <p> ALWAYS READY TO GO ' <p> But Rinek was not about to rush things . The three men sat in the FBI interrogation room and finished their pizza . Stayner sketched small caricatures of Rinek and Boles , and Rinek thought the drawings were good . <p> Stayner made an offhanded remark that sheriff 's deputies and park rangers had interviewed him a day after the murder of the 26-year-old nature guide , Joie Ruth Armstrong . <p> They had seen his International Scout parked near the scene that day and apparently thought he might know something . But after questioning him and searching his truck , they had let him go . <p> No one will ever know for sure why Stayner decided to tell his story on this particular day . Stayner told Boles that the bureau owed his confession to Rinek . <p> And when the time came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First of all , are you the one - I do n't even know her name - who murdered what 's her name ? " Rinek asked . <p> The agent felt ashamed as he shuffled through the police reports he had been given . He prayed that later , when this was all over , the victim 's family would n't be offended that he did n't even know her name . <p> " I think I have her name somewhere here . Joie Ruth , is that the girl that you murdered ? " <p> " Yes , it is . " <p> " How did you come about her ? " <p> " I was driving up to Foresta and went down to a bridge that was washed out and closed down . I was walking around just checking it out ' cause I 'd seen Bigfoot in the area back in the early ' 80s . . . And there was this house on the edge of the meadow . I guess that 's where she lived . <p> " I just noticed her . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rinek said , encouraging him to go on . <p> " I had a small green backpack . In the backpack I had a .22 revolver . . . and a large knife and duct tape . <p> " I walked back by the house and she was out front , and we started talking - actually about Bigfoot . I asked her if she 'd ever seen or heard anything , and she said no . <p> " She stepped up on the porch and then she turned around , " Stayner continued . " That 's when I pulled out the gun and put it to her head . She freaked out . I told her to go inside . . . where I duct-taped her and gagged her . " <p> " You 're doing fine , " Rinek assured him . " This is hard , you 're being good , brave . Go ahead . " <p> " She resisted quite a bit , " Stayner said . " I took her down to my truck and put her in the back seat . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was driving , she started going crazy , just jumping all over the place . And she fell out through the window onto the road . " <p> " So she was trying to get away from you ? " <p> " She did a very good job of it , " Stayner said . " I kinda freaked out . I had the knife in my back pocket . I tried to subdue her , but she was fighting very hard . " <p> " What did you do next ? " <p> " Took the knife from my back pocket and I slit her throat . She did n't die right away . " <p> " How long did it take her to die ? " <p> " ( I ) drug her another 10 , 15 feet . . . I finished the job . I parked my truck in a parking area next to an asphalt road . I went back . . . and I cut her head off . " <p> " Let me ask you a question , " Rinek said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to think I 'm angry at you . When did you put the duct tape , the knife and the gun in your backpack ? " <p> " It 's been there for a long time . " <p> " It 's because you 're always ready to go ? " <p> " Right , " Stayner answered . <p> " You had these items , not because it hit you on the moment ? " <p> " No , it was something I was looking forward to . " " You said to me at one point you were obsessive-compulsive , " Rinek continued . " Is it something that you feel occupied most of your thought process ? " <p> " Every waking moment , " Stayner responded . <p> " What was your intent ? " <p> " To sexually molest her . " <p> Rinek needed another break . He needed emotionally to prepare himself to hear the rest of Stayner 's confession . The Sund-Pelosso case had been his . And he would have to live with the knowledge that a fourth woman had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MYSTERY <p> The Sund-Pelosso case had turned Rinek 's career upside down . <p> More than five months earlier , on Feb. 16 , 1999 , Carole Sund , her 15-year-old daughter , Juli , and their Argentine friend failed to show up in San Francisco after a visit to Yosemite National Park . The three women , who had traveled from the Sunds ' home in Eureka , were supposed to meet Carole 's husband , Jens , and continue on to the Grand Canyon . They wanted to show 16-year-old Silvina Pelosso as many sights as possible before she returned to South America . <p> Carole Sund had been an exchange student in Argentina when she was a teenager and lived with Silvina 's mother and her family . Sund and Silvina 's mother , both in their 40s , continued their friendship and wanted the same for their daughters . <p> But they and their red rental car seemed to have fallen off the face of the earth . Investigators believed they had stayed the night of Feb. 15 at the Cedar Lodge in El Portal , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River . Numerous witnesses saw them there that evening . But the rest was a mystery . <p> Then a clue - Carole Sund 's wallet was found on a Modesto street three days after the three disappeared . It was turned over to authorities the next day . <p> The Mariposa County Sheriff 's Department combed El Portal for leads . They found some curious inconsistencies in the motel room where the three stayed . One of the beds was missing a top sheet and a blanket was gone . They did n't know it at the time , but shreds of Juli 's pajamas were matted in the carpet . <p> James Maddock , the special agent in charge of the Sacramento FBI office , felt sure the three had been the victims of a crime . Maybe they were attacked in their motel room or in the parking lot as they packed up their car to leave the lodge early on Feb. 16 . There was also a chance that they were carjacked in Modesto . <p> But FBI profilers , sent from Quantico , Va. , found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sund 's car had skidded off an icy road in the winding Sierra . If the three had survived such a crash , time was running out for them . Temperatures were at freezing . <p> Rinek was called to Modesto on Feb. 22 and was made case agent . It was one of those investigations that the whole world was watching . His career could soar . Or it could crash and burn . <p> After Rinek was put in charge of the Sund-Pelosso case , he spent weeks trying to hunt down bank records . Suspicious calls had been made to Carole Sund 's bank by one or more women claiming to be Sund . They had Sund 's Social Security number and were requesting financial information . <p> So Rinek and a banking specialist tried to trace the origins of the calls . It was no easy job , and Rinek feared that his boss , Maddock , thought it was a waste of time . But Rinek believed it was the best lead they had and continued the tedious work . <p> As the days passed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the staff at the Cedar Lodge . One employee in particular piqued their interest . The man had been seen changing the locks on the Sunds and Pelosso 's motel room on the day they vanished . He had a criminal record and his brother was a registered sex offender . <p> Maddock was excited . The top supervisors were sure this was their guy . Rinek advised Maddock that it was still too early to focus on any one person . Not long after their conversation , Rinek sensed a chill between them . <p> Rinek was right not to get his hopes too high , because their suspect passed a polygraph test . So he and the other investigators quickly moved on . They started investigating a second employee at the Cedar Lodge . <p> The worker agreed to take a polygraph and failed . Maddock 's hopes soared . Rinek was cautious . After all , lots of innocent people fail lie detector tests . <p> They were unable to link him to the Sunds and Pelosso 's disappearance , so over the next couple of weeks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area . <p> They also continued to interview lodge employees , including a handyman named Cary Stayner.INVESTIGATORS AT ODDS On March 18 , 1999 , a man target shooting about 100 yards north of Highway 108 , between Long Barn and Sierra Village , discovered Carole Sund 's red Pontiac Grand Prix . <p> The rental car was badly burned and clothing , purses and other items were found strewn across the area . Agents waited until the following morning , when they would have more light , to search the trunk . It was there that they found the charred remains of Carole Sund and Silvina Pelosso . <p> The case , which the FBI had dubbed " Tournap , " for tourist kidnapping , immediately switched gears from a missing persons search to a homicide investigation . And authorities were focusing on a pair of ex-cons living in Modesto . They had pretty much ruled out Cedar Lodge employees . Stayner , who lived at the motel , was questioned for a short time and never looked at again . <p> Eugene " Rufus " Dykes and Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lived near the area where Carole Sund 's wallet had been recovered . Both men had been arrested for unrelated crimes shortly after the three tourists vanished . A retired Modesto police officer received a tip from an informant that the two , now in custody , may have been involved in the women 's disappearance . The retired cop told an FBI agent , who in turn told her supervisor . <p> Soon , she and Rinek were on their way to Modesto . They and other investigators interviewed Dykes ' and Larwick 's neighbors and searched apartments and cars . Sixty-seven miles away , an evidence response team combed the Pontiac and the surrounding areas , looking for clues - anything that would lead them to the killers or to Juli Sund . <p> During the next couple of days , Rinek worked hard with the other members of the Tournap task force to link Larwick and Dykes to the Sunds and Pelosso . But he found himself disagreeing more and more with his supervisors over the direction of the investigation . And he felt that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Nick Rossi , an agent with only four years ' experience , would take over the case . Rossi , a Harvard-educated lawyer , served as a spokesman for the Sacramento FBI office . He was well-liked by reporters and considered to be a close confidant to Maddock . <p> Maddock thought that Rinek was bad with paperwork and that Rossi 's organizational skills were more suited for such a complicated case . <p> It was a slap in the face to Rinek , who in addition to feeling belittled , thought it inappropriate to put an inexperienced agent whose official duty was to deal with the media in charge of a high-profile case . His resentment nearly caused him to walk out on the job . Pride and a sense of responsibility made him stay . <p> On March 25 , authorities found Juli 's badly decomposed body near a lookout point at Lake Don Pedro , northeast of Merced . An anonymous letter and crude map had been mailed to the FBI 's Modesto office , tipping them to the third victim 's whereabouts . <p> And Dykes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in the tourists ' killings . A grand jury in Fresno began investigating , and soon confidential aspects of the case were leaked to the press . Though no charges had been filed , the media were only too happy to gobble up every morsel and feed it to the public . <p> After weeks of failing to corroborate Dykes ' confession , Rinek and other members of the task force feared they were going in the wrong direction . They advised Maddock to move on . But their supervisor felt that there was some physical evidence - fibers found near Juli 's body matched fibers found in one of the brother 's trucks - linking them to the killings . And Larwick and Dykes had no alibi at the time of the murders . <p> In June , Maddock made a public declaration that the killers of the Sunds and Pelosso were safely behind bars . Charges , he said , would be filed imminently . <p> There was a sense of relief . Tourists returned to Yosemite in droves , and residents felt it was safe to again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Frank , would later tell agents that after the Sunds and Pelosso went missing , he warned his daughter to be careful . She told him not to worry , that the FBI had announced that the killers were in jail . <p> Rinek 's role in the case had become tertiary , and , frankly , he was glad . He feared the investigation was turning into a debacle . <p> The whole experience was taking a horrible toll - emotionally and physically - on the agent . Chronic pain in his knees , which he had been trying to ignore for years , became unbearable that summer and doctors recommended knee replacement surgery . <p> The case had worn him down and Rinek was depressed . He was no longer the confident and capable man he once was.THE CHILLING CONFESSION <p> Now , as he listened to Stayner 's chilling confession , Rinek knew he had been right all along . <p> There would be vindication , but no consolation . Rinek and Boles would hand Maddock his case on a platter . But four women were dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been proud to serve for 22 years . <p> As Stayner started talking about the Sund and Pelosso killings , Rinek paid close attention . The handyman said he first spied the trio in room 509 , in a secluded wing of the Cedar Lodge . They had settled down for the night and were watching " Jerry Maguire " on the VCR . <p> " I did n't see a man in the room , so they were vulnerable . Easy prey , " Stayner said . " I went back to my room and got my backpack with my kit . " <p> Then he returned to their room . <p> " I knock on their door . ( Carole Sund ) opened up the curtain and looked out . " <p> " OK , " Rinek said , encouraging him . <p> " I told her we have a water leak problem . She did n't wan na let me in . I said , OK , no problem , ma'am , I 'll just get the manager . ' Then she agreed to let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , do you force it open to go in ? " Rinek asked . <p> " No . I walked in there , stood on the toilet , pulled the fan down , made it look authentic . I was walking out of the bathroom . That 's when I pulled the gun out . <p> " I told them I was a desperate man . I needed out of the county , I needed the keys to their car and all their money . " <p> " What did they do when you pulled the gun out ? " <p> " The mother 's eyes got real big and she went for her purse . I told her to get on the bed . . . And I tied them up . " <p> " OK , " Rinek said . <p> " I led both ( girls ) into the bathroom , " Stayner continued . <p> " And you go out and mom was lying on the bed where you left her ? " Rinek asked . " What 'd you do next ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . I stepped on the bed and stepped over and kinda sat on her back and wrapped the rope around her neck and nonchalantly strangled her to death . " <p> Stayner said he dumped Carole 's body in the trunk of her rental car and came back into the room . He retrieved the teenagers from the bathroom . <p> " I put Juli on the bed and the Pelosso girl on the other bed and cut their clothes off , " he told the agents . " There was a lot of little pieces of cloth on the carpet . " <p> He told the girls that Carole was in another room and proceeded to sexually assault them . When Silvina 's incessant crying became too much for Stayner , he led her into the bathroom and strangled her , too . Later , he would stash her body next to Carole 's in the car . Stayner abused Juli for seven hours , but he had been impotent much of his life and could not sustain an erection . Frustrated and worried that it would soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove her to Lake Don Pedro . There , he slashed her throat . <p> " I wished I could keep her , " Stayner said . " I told her she had a good chance to get away ( back ) in the room . I took the knife out of my back pocket . I bunched her hair up in a ponytail on top of her head and pulled her head back and told her I loved her and I slit her throat . " <p> Juli did n't die immediately , and Stayner said she motioned for him to finish the job . <p> Rinek asked him whether he felt anything during the killings . <p> " There really was n't any - very little feeling , " he said while sighing . " I had no feeling . " <p> " So you felt in control ? " Rinek asked . <p> " Very much so . . . . I just felt like I had a little more power for once . " <p> Throughout the confession , Rinek encouraged Stayner to come clean , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was the one who had sent the map directing searchers to Juli 's body . He said he paid a kid $5 to spit in a container so he could use the saliva to seal the envelope . <p> Stayner said he tossed Carole Sund 's wallet in Modesto to throw off investigators . Someone else , he said , must have gotten her Social Security number and called the bank . <p> In the end , he provided all the details necessary to get a conviction against him . While he was in the interrogation room , Stayner voiced resignation that his crimes would probably cost him his life . <p> " I know they are gon na give me the death penalty , " he said . <p> Rinek thought there was a good chance that prosecutors would seek capital punishment . He should have felt proud . But Rinek just felt pity . <p> Stayner was a sick man . Maybe it was because he himself had been a victim , or maybe he just did n't work right . Rinek would never know . What he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , handsome and artistic . There were four victims here , but five lives had been laid to waste . <p> " You helped a lot of people today , including us , " Rinek told Stayner . " And the closure is just worth a lot . And you know what ? I think your nightmares will start dissipating . " <p> In the end , Stayner had done the right thing . Now it was Rinek 's turn . " I 'll be there for you as long as it goes , as far as it goes , because I believe in you . " <p> Then he promised Stayner that as soon as the interview concluded , he would drive the more than 110 miles to the Stayner family home in Atwater . He wanted to be the one to tell Cary Stayner 's story . He did not want his parents getting it from the evening news . <p> " The one thing I do n't want them to see you as is the type of person that would take Steven and hold him for those years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like those people . Those people had no conscience - they did n't do what you are doing . " <p> EPILOGUE <p>  --  James Maddock : A day after the Stayner confession , the FBI supervisor held a press conference . An emotional Maddock said , " I ask myself if we could have done anything differently that would have prevented the death of Joie Armstrong . I 've struggled with that over the last 24 hours , and I continue to do so . . . ( but ) I 'm confident that we 've done everything that reasonably could have been done .
