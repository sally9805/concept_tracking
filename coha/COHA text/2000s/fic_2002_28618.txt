HOW TO BE ALONE ESSAYS By JONATHAN FRANZEN FARRAR , STRAUS AND GIROUX Chapter One A WORD ABOUT THIS BOOK My third novel , The Corrections , which I 'd worked on for many years , was published a week before the World Trade Center fell . This was a time when it seemed that the voices of self and commerce ought to fall silent-a time when you wanted , in Nick Carraway 's phrase , " the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever . " Nevertheless , business is business . Within forty-eight hours of the calamity , I was giving interviews again . My interviewers were particularly interested in what they referred to as " the Harper 's essay . " ( Nobody used the original title , " Perchance to Dream , " that the magazine 's editors had given it . ) Interviews typically began with the question : " In your Harper 's essay in 1996 , you promised that your third book would be a big social novel that would engage with mainstream culture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that promise with The Corrections ? " To each succeeding interviewer I explained that , no , to the contrary , I had barely mentioned my third novel in the essay ; that the notion of a " promise " had been invented out of thin air by an editor or a headline writer at the Times Sunday Magazine ; and that , in fact , far from promising to write a big social novel that would bring news to the mainstream , I 'd taken the essay as an opportunity to renounce that variety of ambition . Because most interviewers had n't read the essay , and because the few who had read it seemed to have misunderstood it , I became practiced at giving a clear , concise prcis of its argument ; by the time I did my hundredth or hundred-tenth interview , in November , I 'd worked up a nice little corrective spiel that began , " No , actually , the Harper 's essay was about abandoning my sense of social responsibility as a novelist and learning to write fiction for the fun and entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a little aggrieved , that nobody seemed able to discern this simple , clear idea in the text . How willfully stupid , I thought , these media people were ! In December I decided to pull together an essay collection that would include the complete text of " Perchance to Dream " and make clear what I had and had n't said in it . But when I opened the April 1996 Harper 's I found an essay , evidently written by me , that began with a five-thousand-word complaint of such painful stridency and tenuous logic that even I could n't quite follow it . In the five years since I 'd written the essay , I 'd managed to forget that I used to be a very angry and theory-minded person . I used to consider it apocalyptically worrisome that Americans watch a lot of TV and do n't read much Henry James . I used to be the kind of religious nut who convinces himself that , because the world does n't share his particular faith ( for me , a faith in literature ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think that our American political economy was a vast cabal whose specific aim was to thwart my artistic ambitions , exterminate all that I found lovely in civilization , and also rape and murder the planet in the process . The first third of the Harper 's essay was written from this place of anger and despair , in a tone of high theoretical dudgeon that made me cringe a little now . It 's true that , even in 1996 , I intended the essay to document a stalled novelist 's escape from the prison of his angry thoughts . And so part of me is inclined now to reprint the thing exactly as it first appeared , as a record of my former zealotry . I 'm guessing , though , that most readers will have limited appetite for pronouncements such as It seemed clear to me that if anybody who mattered in business or government believed there was a future in books , we would not have been witnessing such a frenzy in Washington and on Wall Street to raise half a trillion dollars for an Infobahn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wreak on reading ( " You have to get used to reading on a screen " ) but could not conceal their indifference to the prospect . Because a little of this goes a long way , I 've exercised my authorial license and cut the essay by a quarter and revised it throughout . ( I 've also retitled it " Why Bother ? " ) Although it 's still very long , my hope is that it 's less taxing to read now , more straightforward in its movement . If nothing else , I want to be able to point to it and say , " See , the argument is really quite clear and simple , just like I said ! " What goes for the Harper 's essay goes for this collection as a whole . I intend this book , in part , as a record of a movement away from an angry and frightened isolation toward an acceptance-even a celebration-of being a reader and a writer . Not that there 's not still plenty to be mad and scared about . Our national thirst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an ugly Gulf War , is now threatening to lead us into an open-ended long-term conflict in Central Asia . Although you would n't have thought it possible , Americans seem to be asking even fewer questions about their government today than in 1991 , and the major media sound even more monolithically jingoistic . While Congress yet again votes against applying easily achievable fuel-efficiency standards to SUVs , the president of Ford Motor Company can be seen patriotically defending these vehicles in a TV ad , avowing that Americans must never accept " boundaries of any kind . " With so much fresh outrageousness being manufactured daily , I 've chosen to do only minimal tinkering with the other essays in this book . " First City " reads a little differently without the World Trade Center ; " Imperial Bedroom " was written before John Ashcroft came to power with his seeming indifference to personal liberties ; anthrax has lent further poignancy to the woes of the United States Postal Service , as described in " Lost in the Mail " ; and Oprah Winfrey 's disinvitation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elitist " fluoresce in the several essays where it appears . But the local particulars of content matter less to me than the underlying investigation in all these essays : the problem of preserving individuality and complexity in a noisy and distracting mass culture : the question of how to be alone . Chapter Two MY FATHER 'S BRAIN Here 's a memory . On an overcast morning in February 1996 , I received in the mail from my mother , in St. Louis , a Valentine 's package containing one pinkly romantic greeting card , two four-ounce Mr. Goodbars , one hollow red filigree heart on a loop of thread , and one copy of a neuropathologist 's report on my father 's brain autopsy . I remember the bright gray winter light that morning . I remember leaving the candy , the card , and the ornament in my living room , taking the autopsy report into my bedroom , and sitting down to read it . The brain ( it began ) weighed 1,225 gm and showed parasagittal atrophy with sulcal widening . I remember translating grams into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supermarket meat case . I remember putting the report back into its envelope without reading any further . Some years before he died , my father had participated in a study of memory and aging sponsored by Washington University , and one of the perks for participants was a postmortem brain autopsy , free of charge . I suspect that the study offered other perks of monitoring and treatment which had led my mother , who loved freebies of all kinds , to insist that my father volunteer for it . Thrift was also probably her only conscious motive for including the autopsy report in my Valentine 's package . She was saving thirty-two cents ' postage . My clearest memories of that February morning are visual and spatial : the yellow Mr. Goodbar , my shift from living room to bedroom , the late-morning light of a season as far from the winter solstice as from spring . I 'm aware , however , that even these memories are n't to be trusted . According to the latest theories , which are based on a wealth of neurological and psychological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an album in which memories are stored discretely like unchanging photographs . A memory is , instead , in the phrase of the psychologist Daniel L. Schachter , a " temporary constellation " of activity-a necessarily approximate excitation of neural circuits that bind a set of sensory images and semantic data into the momentary sensation of a remembered whole . These images and data are seldom the exclusive property of one particular memory . Indeed , even as my experience on that Valentine 's morning was unfolding , my brain was relying on pre-existing categories of " red " and " heart " and " Mr. Goodbar " ; the gray sky in my windows was familiar from a thousand other winter mornings ; and I already had millions of neurons devoted to a picture of my mother-her stinginess with postage , her romantic attachments to her children , her lingering anger toward my father , her weird lack of tact , and so on . What my memory of that morning therefore consists of , according to the latest models , is a set of hardwired neuronal connections among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the entire constellation to light up-chemically , electrically-when any one part of the circuit is stimulated . Speak the words " Mr. Goodbar " and ask me to free-associate , and if I do n't say " Diane Keaton " I will surely say " brain autopsy . " My Valentine 's memory would work this way even if I were dredging it up now for the first time ever . But the fact is that I 've re-remembered that February morning countless times since then . I 've told the story to my brothers . I 've offered it as an Outrageous Mother Incident to friends of mine who enjoy that kind of thing . I 've even , shameful to report , told people I hardly know at all . Each succeeding recollection and retelling reinforces the constellation of images and knowledge that constitute the memory . At the cellular level , according to neuroscientists , I 'm burning the memory in a little deeper each time , strengthening the dendritic connections among its components , further encouraging the firing of that specific set of synapses . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature that makes our gray matter so much smarter than any machine yet devised ( my laptop 's cluttered hard drive or a World Wide Web that insists on recalling , in pellucid detail , a Beverly Hills 90210 fan site last updated on 11/20/98 ) , is our ability to forget almost everything that has ever happened to us . I retain general , largely categorical memories of the past ( a year spent in Spain ; various visits to Indian restaurants on East Sixth Street ) but relatively few specific episodic memories . Those memories that I do retain I tend to revisit and , thereby , strengthen . They become **25;325;TOOLONG , electrochemically-part of the architecture of my brain . This model of memory , which I 've presented here in a rather loose layperson 's summary , excites the amateur scientist in me . It feels true to the twinned fuzziness and richness of my own memories , and it inspires awe with its image of neural networks effortlessly self-coordinating , in a massively parallel way , to create my ghostly consciousness and my remarkably sturdy sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The human brain is a web of a hundred billion neurons , maybe as many as two hundred billion , with trillions of axons and dendrites exchanging quadrillions of messages by way of at least fifty different chemical transmitters . The organ with which we observe and make sense of the universe is , by a comfortable margin , the most complex object we know of in that universe . And yet it 's also a lump of meat . At some point , maybe later on that same Valentine 's Day , I forced myself to read the entire pathology report . It included a " Microscopic Description " of my father 's brain : Sections of the frontal , parietal , occipital , and temporal cerebral cortices showed numerous senile plaques , prominently diffuse type , with minimal numbers of neurofibrillary tangles . Cortical Lewy bodies were easily detected in H &E; stained material . The amygdala demonstrated plaques , occasional tangles and mild neuron loss . In the notice that we had run in local newspapers nine months earlier , my mother insisted that we say my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked the phrase 's formality and reticence , but it was hard not to hear her grievance in it as well , her emphasis on long . The pathologist 's identification of senile plaques in my father 's brain served to confirm , as only an autopsy could , the fact with which she 'd struggled daily for many years : like millions of other Americans , my father had had Alzheimer 's disease . This was his disease . It was also , you could argue , his story . But you have to let me tell it . ALZHEIMER 'S IS A DISEASE of classically " insidious onset . " Since even healthy people become more forgetful as they age , there 's no way to pinpoint the first memory to fall victim to it . The problem was especially vexed in the case of my father , who not only was depressive and reserved and slightly deaf but also was taking strong medicines for other ailments . For a long time it was possible to chalk up his non sequiturs to his hearing impairment , his forgetfulness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chalk them up we did . My memories of the years of my father 's initial decline are vividly about things other than him . Indeed , I 'm somewhat appalled by how large I loom in my own memories , how peripheral my parents are . But I was living far from home in those years . My information came mainly from my mother 's complaints about my father , and these complaints I took with a grain of salt ; she 'd been complaining to me pretty much all my life . My parents ' marriage was , it 's safe to say , less than happy . They stayed together for the sake of their children and for want of hope that divorce would make them any happier . As long as my father was working , they enjoyed autonomy in their respective fiefdoms of home and workplace , but after he retired , in 1981 , at the age of sixty-six , they commenced a round-the-clock performance of No Exit in their comfortably furnished suburban house . I arrived for brief visits like a U.N . peacekeeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . Unlike my mother , who was hospitalized nearly thirty times in her life , my father had perfect health until he retired . His parents and uncles had lived into their eighties and nineties , and he , Earl Franzen , fully expected to be around at ninety " to see , " as he liked to say , " how things turn out .
