The day I decided to change my life , I was wearing sweatpants and an old oxford of Peter 's with a coffee stain down the front . I had n't showered because the whole family had slept in one motel room the night before , and it was all we could do to get back on the road without someone dropping the remote in the toilet or pooping on the floor . <br> We had just driven across the country to start Peter 's new job . Houston , <br> Texas , to Cambridge , Massachusetts . I 'd had the kids in our tenyear- <br> old Subaru the whole drive , two car seats and a booster across the <br> back . Alexander kept taking Toby 's string cheese , and the baby , except <br> when he was sleeping , was fussing . Peter drove the U-Haul on the theory <br> that if it broke , he ' d know how to fix it . <br> On the road , I was sure I had the short end of the stick , especially <br> during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hauling all our <br> belongings up three flights of narrow stairs , and I was at the park , on a <br> blanket in the late-afternoon shade , breast-feeding Baby Sam . Peter had <br> to be hurting . Even with our new landlord helping him , it was taking all <br> day . And I was just waiting for him to call on the cell phone when he was <br> ready for us to come home . Or as close to home as a curtainless apartment <br> stacked high with boxes could be . <br> We ' d been at the park since midmorning , and we were running low on snacks . Alexander and Toby were galloping at top speed , as they always did . I 'm not even sure they realized they were in a new park . They acted like we might as well have been at home , in Houston , the only place they 'd ever lived . They acted like the last five days of driving had n't even registered . I , in contrast , was aching with loss . <br> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand-new , too perfect . The <br> parks at home had character  --  monkey bars fashioned like cowboys , <br> gnarled crape myrtle trunks for climbing , discarded Big Wheels with no <br> seats . And we 'd known them backward and forward  --  every tree knot , <br> every mud hole , every kid . <br> This park , today , felt forced . It was trying too hard . <br> I surveyed the moms . Not one of them , I decided , was a person I <br> wanted to meet . And just as I was disliking them all and even starting to <br> pity them for having no idea what they were missing , park-wise , Toby  --  <br> my middle boy , my sandy-haired , blue-eyed , two-year-old flirt  --  watched <br> a younger kid make a move for the truck in his hand , and then , unbelievably , grabbed that kid 's forearm and bit it . <br> The little boy screamed as Toby pulled the truck to his chest . " My <br> truck ! " Toby shouted . ( He always pronounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was , perhaps , another issue . ) <br> And then , of course , all hell broke loose . <br> I jumped up , startling the baby out of a nap and off my boob . I ran <br> across the park , wailing baby on my shoulder , shirt unbuttoned , shouting , <br> " Toby ! No ! " Toby saw my horrified face and instantly started to <br> cry himself  --  though he was no match for the little kid he ' d bitten , who <br> was now screaming like he was on fire . His mother , too , had sprinted <br> from her perch , dropping her purse on the way , and was now holding <br> him as if he 'd been shot . " Is it bleeding ? " she kept asking the boy . " Is it <br> bleeding ? " <br> It was clearly not bleeding . Is n't that the number one rule of parenting ? <br> Do n't Make Things Worse ? <br> All the other parents , meanwhile , had gathered around us to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging open , the baby was still <br> shrieking , and I remembered from one of those parenting books I used to <br> read  --  back when I used to do that type of thing  --  that when a child bites , <br> the parent of the biter must give attention to the bitee . I turned toward the <br> little boy and reached out to comfort him , and , at the same moment , his <br> mother actually tightened her grip on him and rocked away from my <br> hand so that I missed him altogether . As if I myself had done the biting . <br> As if I were about to attack again . <br> I regrouped . " I 'm so sorry about that , sweetheart ! " I said to the boy , <br> who was not , you might say , in a listening mode . Next , I tried his mother . <br> " I 'm so sorry ! " I said . " He ' s never done that before ! " She was staring <br> at me , but not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that it was , <br> in fact , my uncovered magenta nursing bra she was looking at . I buttoned <br> my shirt and started to try again when Alexander took that moment <br> to push Toby down and take the very truck that had started all this <br> commotion . <br> Toby let out a wail like a scalded dog , and Alexander threw the truck <br> with all his might into a nearby bush . " No biting ! " he said , pointing at <br> Toby . " Biting is rude ! " Toby got up to run after the truck and soon they <br> were both tangled in the bush , wrestling for it . <br> Here was a moment when I was truly outnumbered . With two kids , in <br> moments like this , you at least have an arm for each . With three kids , <br> you 're just screwed . <br> " Stop it ! Both of you ! " I shouted , sounding just like my own mother <br> had years ago when she had been outnumbered , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could think of . I set Baby Sam down <br> on the sidewalk  --  at ten months , he was n't crawling yet , or even thinking <br> about it  --  stepped into the bush , took the truck , and wedged it high <br> in the branch of a tree . Then I grabbed the two boys by the scruffs of <br> their necks , dragged them to our blanket , sprinted back over to my nowalmost- <br> purple-with-hysteria Baby Sam , picked him up , put him on the <br> boob , and then marched back to where the boys were . <br> " Anybody who moves off this blanket gets a spanking , " I said in my <br> meanest mom voice , sounding for all the world like a 1930s gangster . It <br> was an empty threat . Peter and I were n't spankers . And I was n't about to <br> spank anybody in front of the still-gaping crowd of Cambridge parents <br> ten feet away . But , honestly , what else was I going to do ? Send the boys <br> to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment was . <br> The bitee and his mother eventually gathered themselves up and <br> limped out of the park , giving us the cold shoulder the whole way . It occurred to me that park etiquette probably dictated we should be the ones <br> to leave . But , since we were waiting on Peter , we stayed . I tore open some <br> cheese sticks . Alexander and Toby soon forgot about the whole thing  --  <br> though not until after I 'd given them the best talking-to I could muster <br> about how we all had to work together in this time of transition  --  and <br> they were back on the swings in no time . Alexander , sweetly , got down <br> again and again to give Toby another push . <br> The old crop of parents trickled out , replaced by the after-work <br> crowd . This batch was preppier and wealthier  --  pushing Bugaboos and <br> carrying $200 diaper bags . One woman caught my eye as someone I <br> might like to be friends with . She wore stylishly frayed khakis and <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and willed her to come over <br> and talk to me . The bitee ' s mother excepted , I had n't talked to an adult <br> since ten o'clock that morning , when we 'd said good-bye to Peter . <br> And then she did come over . Her daughter toddled up to our blanket <br> wanting to look at Baby Sam , who was now eating from a spilled constellation of Cheerios in front of him . The mom stood beside us , and I <br> squinted up at her in the late-afternoon sun . I could tell she wanted to <br> ask me a question . And from the way she was composing herself , I <br> guessed it was a good one . I was hoping for " You 're new here , are n't <br> you ? " or something like it . Something that might lead to a real moment <br> of exchange between the two of us , or , at the very least , a phone number <br> from her and an invitation to call . I 'd only been away from home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . <br> She did have a question for me , it turned out . And it was not about <br> how long I 'd been in town . Tucking her hair behind her ears , she squatted <br> down next to her toddler  --  who was now picking up our Cheerios <br> one by one , too  --  took a gander at me , sitting next to my ten-monthold , <br> and said , " When are you due ? " <br> Here is my policy on that question : Do n't ever ask it . Even if you 're <br> talking to a woman who is clearly about to have quintuplets . Just do n't <br> ask . Because if you 're wrong , you 've just said one of the most horrible <br> things you can say to a woman . If you 're wrong , you 've ruined her <br> week  --  possibly her month and even her year . If you 're wrong , she will <br> go home and cry , and not even be able to tell her husband what she ' s <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she lies facedown on their bed , <br> and she ' ll have no choice but to say , " It 's nothing , " and then , " Please , <br> just leave me alone . " <br> This woman in the khakis , she was wrong . And I did go home and <br> cry , but not until much later , because just at the moment she spoke , before <br> I had even settled on a response , another woman approached us and <br> leaned in to peer at me . <br> " Lanie ? " she asked . <br> I met her eyes . I was pretty certain I did n't know a single person in <br> Massachusetts , and so , given the circumstances , it was amazing , even to <br> me , that I recognized her . It was Amanda Hayes from Houston , my high <br> school 's favorite cheerleader , and , even all these years later , she had not <br> changed at all . If anything , she looked better . But still exactly as blond , <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She might as well have been <br> carrying pom-poms . <br> " Hi ! " I shouted , too loudly . " Hello ! " <br> I might have been fueled by my fight-or-flight reaction to the woman <br> in khaki pants , but I stood up and gave Amanda Hayes , a girl I 'd barely <br> known in high school , a hug . Then I threw myself into a kind of <br> conversation-on-steroids with her , acting far more delighted to see her <br> than I might have otherwise . I would have been friendly in any situation , <br> just as we ' d always been friendly to each other during assigned seating <br> in Chorus , but I might not have been quite as riveted . <br> I was hoping that , witnessing a reunion of two women who had a real <br> connection to each other , the when-are-you-due girl might feel out of <br> place and wander off . She did n't . Her child continued to eat my Cheerios , <br> and she continued to stand there , smiling as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of us moms were friends , drinking mojitos <br> and whiling away another afternoon with the kiddos . <br> I asked Amanda every single question I could think of , trying to fill any <br> conversational pauses before Khaki Pants started up again with her pregnancy <br> topic . What was Amanda doing in town ? How long had she lived <br> here ? What were her thoughts on Middle East peace ? Where did she get <br> those great sunglasses ? <br> And Amanda , bless her , met my enthusiasm for our chat head-on . <br> She answered all my questions , and volleyed several back at me , and just <br> when I was starting to feel like we 'd built a conversational wall that the <br> woman in khakis could n't scale , Amanda 's daughter , Gracin  --  who was <br> almost four and , it turned out , exactly one day older than Alexander  --  <br> came running over to ask for a Band-Aid . <br> " Did you get an ouchie ? " Amanda asked . <br> Gracin pointed at her arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amanda peeled a Band-Aid from a stash in her pocket , then <br> put it on Gracin , who ran off . Watching her go , I noticed she had Band- <br> Aids all down her legs . <br> " She loves Band-Aids , " Amanda told us , with a what-are-yougonna- <br> do shrug . <br> And then , in that moment , Amanda paused to gaze at her daughter , <br> now climbing up the ramp of the slide , and take one of those small moments <br> that parents sometimes indulge in when their children are a little <br> at a distance . She was admiring her , and possibly even wondering what <br> stroke of insane luck had brought that exact child into her life , and feeling <br> grateful for all her blessings . Amanda got caught up in watching her <br> daughter , and I got caught up in watching Amanda , and so I was a split- <br> second late cranking up the conversation again  --  and into that little gap , <br> Khaki Pants leaned in , touched my sleeve , and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <br> Amanda snapped around to look at me . " You 're pregnant ? " she <br> asked , ready to be delighted . <br> I could n't decide what to say . Time got very slow . Baby Sam was <br> chewing on a rock . Alexander had captured a bug and was building a little <br> mud house for it . Toby had found a fallen branch and was dragging it <br> around the park , showing it off . The sun had set and the light was fading <br> from the sky . Peter still had n't called . Finally , faced with the prospect of <br> having to say , " No , I 'm just still fat from my last pregnancy . And it 's possible I weigh even more now than I did when I was actually pregnant because <br> it 's been a tough year and my husband keeps bringing me tubes of <br> frozen cookie dough , " I said , instead , in a voice that seemed to rise up <br> without my permission : " Yes . " <br> Amanda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . <br> " Four kids ! " <br> Khaki Pants , who 'd been sure of it all along , said , " It 's so awful to be <br> pregnant in the summer . Are n't you hot ? " <br> A little woozy , now , from my sudden imaginary pregnancy , I just <br> nodded and said , " I sure am . " <br> I had the strangest moment of relief right then , in those seconds , as <br> the impact of what I 'd said washed over us . I let myself believe it just a <br> little , and I let it explain a lot of things about why I just could not seem <br> to pull myself together . I was pregnant again ! Morning sickness , back <br> pain . One baby still nursing . Three boys , a husband who obsessed over <br> his work , no help . And no money at all . Of course I had n't worn any lipstick since Toby ate my last tube in the checkout line at the grocery ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hard work ! <br> Amanda sized up Baby Sam . Then she said , " How old is this one ? " <br> " Oh , " I said . " He ' s a lot older than he looks . " I did n't have a lot of <br> experience with lying , but it seemed like a good idea to be vague . I <br> started packing up my diaper bag . It was time  --  past time  --  to move out . <br> I shouted to the boys , " Let 's go see Daddy ! " <br> <br> While I folded our blanket , Khaki Pants said , " I have a friend who <br> got pregnant again on the night of her six-week checkup . " <br> Amanda chimed in , " I have a friend with triplets . " <br> There was a pause , then , as all three of us stopped to pay silent tribute <br> to the women we knew whose asses were being kicked even harder than <br> our own were . Then we all seemed to realize at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth child , I would soon fit into that category . The <br> category of people you make small talk about at the park : " She has four <br> kids and no help . " I did n't mind . It was better , certainly , than , " Her baby <br> is ten months old and she still looks pregnant . " <br> Amanda touched my shoulder . " I am so throwing you a shower ! " It <br> seemed like a rash gesture . But we 'd just had quite a conversation . And <br> seeing someone from your hometown when you 're far away can be a <br> crazy thrill . Besides , after our turbo-chat earlier , she knew all about me . <br> She knew I could really use a shower , both literally and figuratively . She <br> pulled a business-size card out of her wallet that read " The Boatman <br> Family " and had her phone number beneath . She said , " Call me and <br> we 'll figure out the date . " <br> " I will , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that housed <br> everything I might ever need : wallet , keys , Q-tips , diapers , wipes , juice <br> boxes , organic granola bars , pacis , and , down at the bottom , crushed <br> cookies , stray raisins , and , this week , an old PB&amp;J congealing inside its <br> Ziploc bag . <br> Baby Sam loved to go through that purse and pull every single thing <br> out , even separating the credit cards in the wallet from their nooks , <br> beaming like a treasure hunter . He could dismantle and destroy the entire <br> contents in under ten minutes . And even though I 'd have much preferred <br> a bag that was orderly , and even though I could 've solved the <br> problem so easily by just , simply , not handing him my bag , I let him <br> have it time and again . It was such an easy response when he started <br> fussing . I found , these days , I was so desperate for harmony that I gladly <br> traded the contents of my bag  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  for even five minutes of everybody happy . <br> Taking Amanda 's card , I knew that within twenty-four hours Baby <br> Sam would find it in my purse , put it in his mouth , chew on it until it <br> looked like a wad of gum , and then leave it on the floor where I 'd step on <br> it in bare feet many hours later on the way to the bathroom in the middle <br> of the night . But it was okay . I would n't have called her anyway . <br> Continues ...
