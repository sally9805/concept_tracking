GADDAFI COMES OUT OF HIS SHELL <P> Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi may be secretive , but we know this : he has great timing . Just when OPEC cutbacks and declining reserves are driving up oil prices , Gaddafi 's mea culpa on his weapons program and open invitation to foreigners to explore for Libyan energy are gaining Western oil firms ' interest . First to benefit : Royal Dutch/Shell , the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate , which last month signed a $200 million deal with Libya 's state-owned oil-and-gas company to search for reserves and build a liquefied-natural-gas terminal .
