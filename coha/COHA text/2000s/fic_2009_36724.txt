PROLOGUE Wildfire <p> I disobeyed . I followed Sire Galan to war , though he had commanded me to go home . He 'd been generous , granting me the use of a stone house on a mountainside for all of my days to come . But how could I call it home , a place I 'd never seen ? A blanket and the ground to lie on with Galan beside me , that was the home I claimed . It did n't suit me to be put aside , judged too weak to endure what lay ahead . I set my will against Sire Galan 's , hazarding that if I did as I pleased , I might also please him . <p> He 'd charged his horsemaster , Flykiller , with the duty of herding me home , along with the warhorses Galan had won in mortal tourney and was forbidden to ride  --  all of us to be turned out to pasture . But I gave Flykiller the slip during the army 's embarkation : two days of shouting and cursing , mules balking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone missing . In such confusion only thieves had been sure of their duties . I took refuge with my friend Mai , and set sail under the copper banners of the clan of Delve . <p> So I found myself now aboard a ship crossing a sullen green sea . Wretched , queasy , beset by misgivings . I lay curled up on deck , one leg heavy on the other , the bones bruising the flesh . My sheepskin cloak was sodden , and from time to time a drop of seawater crawled down my back . The ship creaked under us like an old alewife 's hip joints , and stank of bilgewater , dung , salted fish , and the pungent pitch that coated the planks and rigging . <p> Before we left Corymb , the priests had prayed for a wind from north-ofeast , the domain of Rift , and the god of war had been pleased to send it . For four days this strong cold wind had driven the fleet apace toward the kingdom of Incus . The ships went heavy laden , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weightiest cargo of all , Rift 's banes : war , dread , and death . <p> Yet the war had commenced without us . A tennight ago King Thyrse in his wisdom had sent a small force of men ahead across the Inward Sea to make landfall at the port of Lanx ; Sire Galan and his clansmen of Crux were among them . The king had called them a dagger . A dagger is your best weapon for treachery , and by treachery they were to pass the city 's gates , for the king 's sister , Queenmother Caelum , had allies to let them in . By now they 'd taken Lanx or failed in their purpose . In two or three days , if the wind stayed willing , we 'd know their fate , and therefore our own , whether we would face a sea battle and siege , or the grudging welcome owed to conquerors . <p> The ship was crowded . Idle foot soldiers sat on the rowing benches , dicing and quarreling for amusement . Mai and I had laid claim to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chests fastened to the deck , and we 'd stretched a canvas overhead to make a shelter . Two of her nine children accompanied her on this campaign : her only son , Tobe , and third-daughter Sunup to look after him . We all suffered from Torrent 's hex , seasickness , which made Sunup listless , and Tobe fretful , and gave me a qualmish stomach . Mai suffered the most . She 'd always seemed to me as strong as she was stout , and she was stout indeed . But her strength had dwindled quickly at sea , and I was more troubled than I was willing to show . <p> I sat up beside Mai and leaned against a baggage chest . She was white about the nostrils and her round cheeks had turned yellow as an old bruise . There was sweat on her brow despite the wintry chill in the air . She had her arms clasped over her midriff . She grimaced at me and said , " I think Mouse is trying to thump his way out . " <p> I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the kicks of the child she carried within . A boy , Mai claimed , for the way he rode high , and she thought he 'd come about the time of Longest Night , nearly a month away . She 'd named him Mouse because she swore he had too much Mischief in him  --  Mischief , the boy avatar of the god Lynx , who goes everywhere accompanied by a scurry of mice . I knew she dreaded this birth , for her last child had been stillborn after a long and dangerous travail , and it seemed to me the name was a poor jest and an ill omen . But Mai 's wit was ever on the sharp side . <p> I leaned over and whispered to Mouse , " Too soon , little one . Have patience . " <p> " Let him come , I do n't care , " Mai said . " He 'll split me in two if he gets any bigger . Besides , sick as I am , I could n't feel worse . " <p> " Hush . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with her head under a blanket . She was not yet eleven years of age , and such talk might frighten her . <p> " She 'll know a woman 's travail soon herself . Time she learned about it . " <p> Tobe was cradled in a coil of tarry rope covered with old grain sacks , with Mai 's old piebald dog dozing beside him . Now the boy sat up and began to wail . I took him on my lap and wrapped his cold feet in a fold of my kirtle . Mai had suckled him for two years and only just weaned him , and he still clamored for the tit . I gave him a bit of dried apple to chew , and hugged him . Spoiled or not , he was sweet enough to nibble on . <br> <p> Sire Torosus came to see Mai , walking along the narrow gangway where whiphands paced to make the oarsmen keep the beat when the winds were not so obliging . He jumped down beside us , and the piebald hound bowed before him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I moved over so that Sire Torosus could sit beside Mai . He was narrow where Mai was broad , and she was taller by a forehead . But if a man dared say to Mai 's face that they were mismatched , she would wink , saying Sire Torosus was big where it counted . And when the man made some lewd boastful answer , as he always did , she 'd chase him away with her raucous laugh , saying , " It 's his heart that 's big , lad  --  I wager yours is the size of a filbert , and just as hard ! " <p> Sire Torosus put his hand on Mai 's leg . She kept her face averted and said , " I beg you , go away . I 'm not fit to be seen . " <p> " You 're too vain . " He gave her a buss on the cheek , and she flapped her hand at him . <p> Tobe squirmed in my lap and reached out for Sire Torosus , who let him stand upright on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sire Torosus said to me , " Is there nothing you can do for Mai ? " <p> It pained me to have to show him my palms , empty of comfort . All my remedies , all my herb lore , had failed . I could cool a fever with my hands , but the hex of Torrent Waters was a cold , wet malady , and I was powerless to draw out the chill that had settled deep inside Mai . <p> Sunup asked her father , " Is she going to die ? " She had the pinched look of fear . <p> " Of course not , " he said , and I met his eyes for a moment . <p> I said , " I never heard seasickness was mortal , only that it made folks wish they were dead . " <p> Sire Torosus said to Mai , " Wo n't you come to the cabin , my dumpling , and lie on the featherbed ? " <p> He had a berth in the sterncastle with the other cataphracts and armigers of the Blood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she tried to stay there with the children . She touched his arm , but still she would n't look at him . " It 's stifling inside . Not a breath of air that does n't stink . " <p> He sighed and gave Tobe back to me . <p> Fifteen years they 'd been together , Sire Torosus and Mai . He had a wife , of course , and an heir of his Blood  --  just as Sire Galan did , who had married a year ago and promptly sired a son . But Sire Torosus was never long from Mai 's bed , and they had nine living children to prove it . She was his sheath , and I daresay a truer wife to him than the one he 'd left at home . <p> Sheath had a filthy sound in men 's mouths , being another byname for a woman 's quim , like mudhole or honeypot . But that was the name we went by , those of us who had taken up with a warrior of the Blood or a mudborn soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a blade . From sheath to whore was but a little slip . Often it happened that a woman took a chance on some likely man who lured her with fine promises and caresses , only to find herself at his mercy , lent or sold to his companions . I 'd taken such a chance , and it was my good fortune that Sire Galan had proved jealous rather than generous when it came to sharing my favors . <p> A two-copper whore , without even a blanket of her own , envies a harlot who serves only men of the Blood , who in turn envies a sheath who must please one man only , and above all the sheath of a cataphract such as Sire Galan , the most admired hotspur among the hotspurs of the army . I had merely to stand near him to shine by reflection . I did n't pride myself on this  --  to be eminent among the despised was still to be despised . But I 'd chosen to be Galan 's sheath and I would do the same if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brazen , and wear the word sheath proudly , and never flinch at it . <p> Why then did I suffer a pang of envy to see Mai with Sire Torosus , to think of their many years together , when my time with Sire Galan could be measured by the month ? It was foolish of me . She might hoard in her memory years gone by , to be sure , but no more than I , no more than any sheath , could she store up years that might not come to pass . A warrior is a prodigal spender of his days , and not a miser of them . <p> I knew this , yet I went on as if Galan would live forever . He might be dead already . <p> But that thought was dangerous , it could not be borne or believed . I felt the bond stretched taut between Galan and me , anchored by a hard knot under my breastbone . I would know if that bond were severed . Surely I would know . <br> <p> That night we huddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tobe between us . The dog put his head over my ankles . I was weary , my bones ached , and I drowsed and dreamed . When I woke , the dream was gone and there was nothing left of it but the sure knowledge that I 'd lost something sweet . <p> Tobe squirmed in his sleep until he twisted my old sheepskin cloak about him and pulled it off my back . Greedy boy . Now he kicked as if he were too hot , and I gently tugged the sheepskin away from him and covered us again . <p> We 'd dallied autumn away in the Marchfield , preparing for war , and already the Crone had visited with her winnowing basket full of snow . Winter was n't a fit season for campaigning , it was a season for making and mending . When I 'd served in the Dame 's manor , even the shortest days of winter had seemed ample : time enough for the Dame to weave a common jillybell in a tapestry , or for me to steep skeins of wool in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dame 's housekeeper , Na , to tell stories when there was a pile of stitching for our chapped fingers ; time enough for singing the longest ballads . <p> There was sweet pain in recalling the hands of the Dame and Na busy about their work , for they were dead , and all I had of each was a finger bone that I kept hidden in a pouch under my skirts . They had raised me , a motherless child , so well that I never pined for the mother I could n't remember . Now they were shades , each on a solitary journey , yet sometimes I called on them for counsel . <p> With numb fingers I untied the pouch from the cord around my waist , and I ducked out from under the awning and climbed to the top of a storage chest . While I 'd slept , clouds had descended ; they hung so low that the ship 's masts scraped their underbellies , and we sailed through the narrow crack between sea and sky . Nothing could be seen of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Delve sailed in close company , and beyond them the rest of the fleet was scattered over the sea . As we bobbed up and down , their lanterns seemed to blink , hidden and revealed by the endless swells . I had gotten used to the motion at last ; just the faintest flutter in my belly , nothing troublesome . <p> I was as alone as I could be aboard ship , with only the sailors on watch and the helmsman high in the sterncastle . I took my treasures from the pouch : the two finger bones and Galan 's pledge to me of a house and lands on Mount Sair , inked on a linen scrip that I kept folded in a neat knot . I 'd turned my back on his gift when I chose to follow him , but I cherished it nevertheless . I tucked the scrip in my sleeve for safekeeping . <p> The pouch was a circle of leather fastened by a thong , and I loosened the drawstring and smoothed the pouch flat on my lap to show the divining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been destroyed in the fire that burned Galan 's tent in the Marchfield , I made this one myself , using an awl and string to scribe the three circles , one inside the other , for the three kinds of avatars , male , female , and elemental . I 'd crossed the compass with direction lines to divide it into twelve arcants , each the realm of a god . Then I 'd labeled the arcants , painting the godsigns as neatly as I could around the horizon of the compass , setting the twelve gods in their places one beside the other in the same succession that their constellations appeared in the Heavens . I 'd been pleased , in the making , to see how well the compass reflected the order of the world . <p> I held the bones in my palm : the Dame 's was dyed blue , and Na 's had a red tip . They were tiny things , these bones , the topmost joints from the pointing fingers of their right hands . Na 's sister Az had given them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead . She was a skilled diviner , but I 'd seen her throw the bones only once , and after that had to find my own way with them . <p> No doubt it was selfish to ask the shades of the Dame and Na to tarry on their journey , and strive so hard to speak to me when I understood them so imperfectly . But I believed  --  I hoped  --  they would n't begrudge me an answer , for they 'd been fond of me when they were alive . I closed my hand around the bones and whispered into the hollow of my fist : Will I see Galan again ? <p> I threw in haste and the ship tilted , mounting the slope of a wave , and the bones nearly tumbled from my lap . I snatched them up before they could roll away , and cast again , three times in all , just as Az had shown me , the first for character , the second for time , and the third for the gods who governed the question and must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wishing  --  as often I 'd wished before  --  that I had Az 's knowledge of the avatars , that I might understand how each sign bore upon the others . They could not be understood singly . <p> The Dame touched Crux Heavens on the first throw , which I took to be her judgment of Sire Galan 's character . In ancient days Crux Sun bore seven sons to mortal men , who founded the seven houses of the clan of Crux , and one of those sons was Sire Galan 's forefather . So it was no wonder that with the god 's Blood in Galan 's veins , he partook of Crux 's attributes . Yet of the three avatars of Crux  --  the Sun , Moon , and Heavens  --  I 'd always thought Galan most akin to the Moon in his fickle nature . He 'd given me reason enough to think so . Had I misjudged him ? Perhaps he was indeed more like the Heavens : constant as the stars when he gave his word , and changeable as the weather in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , and a fair welcome when I arrived , but if he greeted me with storms , I was determined not to be daunted . <p> In the second cast the Dame landed on Hazard Peril , in the outer ring of the compass that represents the future , and Na touched the Heavens . Galan  --  the Heavens  --  in Peril . It was not as ominous as it sounded . If Galan was in peril , he was still alive . And Peril could mean a shield against danger , rather than danger itself . Either way , I took the two signs together as good tidings , and I would have been content with that  --  more than content  --  if not for the third cast , for the gods . <p> Both finger bones landed in Ardor Wildfire , but they pointed in contrary directions : the tip of the Dame 's bone touched Torrent Waters , and Na 's touched Delve Will . It was common sense that I should pray to the Waters to permit my crossing , and to Will to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uneasy that both the Dame and Na insisted on Wildfire , Ardor 's most unruly aspect : capricious , greedy , and wrathful . <p> A sign so emphatic must be a warning , and I feared it was meant for Sire Galan . In the Marchfield he had sparked a discord between the clans of Crux and Ardor that had grown into a conflagration . King Thyrse had commanded the clans to satisfy their honor by mortal tourney , and put an end to the feud . Crux had won , and Sire Galan had made enforced peace with the clan of Ardor , but had he made peace with the god Ardor ? <p> I had my own reasons to propitiate the god . Ardor had saved my life twice  --  or rather , spared it twice  --  and also granted me small blessings : a healing song from the firethorn tree , the knack of seeing in the dark , and the gift in my hands of drawing fire from fevers and burns . I was grateful ; at times I was even flattered . And yet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would rather creep the rest of my life beneath the notice of gods than receive more such attentions . <p> I thanked the Dame and Na for their warning , and sacrificed to the gods as they 'd advised . I made a small cut on my arm and sprinkled blood on the deck , and prayed to Torrent and Delve . To Ardor Wildfire I gave a hank of hair from my forelock , burning it with a coal from my fireflask . The singed hair smelled foul . I prayed to Wildfire that Sire Galan be spared Ardor 's wrath , for he 'd done his best to make amends . Furthermore I vowed that when I got to shore , I would burn at Wildfire 's altar as much myrrh as I could get for a golden coin , which was all the gold I had , and I 'd see that Sire Galan did the same . <br> <p> Before dawn the sailors began their daily commotion . I was too restless to try to sleep anymore in our little shelter , which was rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over the side , and leaned on the rail behind the forecastle to watch pleats of foam unfolding in the ship 's wake . I 'd left my cloak behind with Tobe , and the wind twisted my gown and yanked at my headcloth as it drove us along . <p> They were a noisy lot , the sailors , always shouting . I 'd heard some of them call their ship Jouncy , and name her a wanton and a slut ; they said she was the fastest whore that ever lived , and the quickest to capsize for a likely lad . There was pride in their insults . Indeed the ship was hasty , and she moved like a whore who enjoys her business , side to side and up and down . Her body was lean and her prow was sharp and at the rear she was high and round . Bright paint made her look a bawd . Her sails were striped like a harlot 's skirts , and bellied out as if she 'd been gotten with child by the wind . <p> Between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I felt I was astride the ship , riding her . I leaned over the rail to put my hand on her flank as she plunged forward . I adored her just then , the trull , and I felt a kinship with her too , for she came from the Kingswood where I was raised . No doubt her great keel had grown there in a grove of ship oaks , in a tree patiently shaped into the proper curve by woodsmen with cables and stakes , over the course of half a hundred years or a hundred . Her planking was of larch and her three masts of fir . The shipwrights had made a new living thing from these felled trees , and now her sheathing and pegs swelled in the water , her mortises and tenons strained , and she moaned . She was as much a wind creature as a sea creature . <p> The Sun rose behind us and colored the sky and sea red . The clouds overhead had lifted , or perhaps they had outpaced us to gather in the west , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun 's light did not seem to reach there . We raced toward those clouds , or perhaps they raced toward us , and as we came closer they reared up thunderheads like a range of sky mountains , and their shadows turned the silver water dull as hammered pewter . The clouds let down a billowing gray curtain and the horizon vanished . <p> Our sailors hailed the other galleys of Delve , using their own sea language that even the foreigners among them understood , but I did not . There was a great bustle as oarsmen  --  half of them mud soldiers , for there were n't enough seasoned mariners in the fleet  --  ran out the oars . The whiphands played their shrill whistles and the ships drew farther apart . Sailors took down the huge mainsail and hoisted a small square one , so we ran with just the storm sail and the smaller sails fore and aft . <p> A sailor went by on his way up the ladder of the forecastle , and said to me , " You might ought to go below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad ? " <p> " We 're in for a bit of a squall , " he said . <p> No doubt the warning was kindly meant , but I was too ignorant to be afraid . I found it exhilarating , the shrill windsong in the rigging , the changeable light on the sea . A priestess of Delve and her attendants were on the high deck of the sterncastle , chanting and shaking copper disks . Cataphracts and armigers of the Blood joined them in prayers to ward off the storm and call down Delve 's blessings to strengthen the metal that held the ship together . Waves rose higher , sharp edged , with frills and streaks of foam . We came thumping down into a trough and cold spray doused me , and I shivered and licked my lips and tasted salt . The pigs and cattle penned on deck were restless , and in the hold mules brayed and horses thumped against their stalls . <p> I made my way back to Mai and found Tobe and Sunup sheltered in her embrace . The awning overhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " We 're going in , " shouting to be heard above the wind . I took Tobe in my arms and he began to cry . It was hard for Mai to get up , and Sunup and I both braced ourselves to help her . We staggered toward the hatch just behind the mainmast , weaving between the rowers ' benches and the wall of baggage chests . <p> Rift 's wind betrayed us , vanishing in an instant . A wind came from straight ahead and the sails fluttered against the masts and sent us lurching back until I thought we might tip over . But the ship righted herself and slid sideways down the face of a wave . And now wayward gusts came from here , from there , and the ship flew before them , running wherever they 'd have her go . <p> Bagboys and jacks and foot soldiers jostled in the open space around the mast , waiting to go down in the hold with the horses . Mai and her children entered the dark hatch , but I hesitated . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a new realm of white and gray , the water dark as charcoal , the air filled with hard grains of snow that skirled around us , snow sprites turning widdershins over the deck and sea . The other ships had vanished . I think Mai called me to come below , but sailors had already lashed down the hatch cover . <p> I heard rumbling in the distance , a muffled roar I did n't recognize until it careened closer . Thundersnow . The whiteness around us flashed as if the Sun had winked . I thought of Na clutching me tightly during thunderstorms when I was little , for her comfort more than mine . She used to tell me thunder was the sound of Ardor Smith at his anvil , and lightning was Ardor Wildfire dancing , and the safest place to be in a storm was home by the hearth , protected by Ardor Hearthkeeper . <p> Thunder cracked above my head and rolled away from us , and I ducked without thinking . Lightning branched across the veil of snow like a white tree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I closed my eyes I saw the same shape , a green tree against darkness . <p> The waves no longer marched by ranks , but heaved up in confusion and burst against the ship from all sides in a great froth . Oars were as useless as straws in the heavy seas . Drudges cowered under the benches , crying out at every thunderclap and covering their ears . The ship pitched and wallowed , and sometimes she managed to climb to the peak of a wave , and sometimes dove through an oncoming wall of water , and even sure-footed sailors fell and were swept across the canting deck ; a few went overboard . <p> I clung to the ropes of a baggage chest , willing the ship forward . There were gods in this storm , Ardor in the thunder and lightning , Torrent in the churning waters , and Crux in the snow-filled sky , all of them hurling winds at the fleet . Did they mean to founder us ? Or did they contend over whether we should be saved or destroyed ? <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , and waged a mock battle for their sport , and all my frail hopes , and the great ambitions of the king and his sister , Queenmother Caelum , and all these ships too , were merely kindling to be broken between sky and water . <p> I shook in dread , in awe  --  but something fierce in me was not humbled , it roused in answer to the storm 's ruthlessness , so that I nearly laughed in the teeth of the wind . What did our insignificance matter , our brief lives ? At that moment no more was required of me than to witness the gods storming , their vast discord . I could n't regret seeing it , even if it was the last sight I ever saw . <p> The air crackled and I felt a touch , a hand stroking upward along my spine . My skin prickled everywhere and my hair stood upright . The storm split open with a wedge of light and sound , and a blinding whiteness struck the mast and reached for me.Copyright 2009 by Sarah Micklem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
