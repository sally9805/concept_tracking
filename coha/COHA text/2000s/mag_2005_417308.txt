How to ease your separation anxiety as your child grows // Let 's face it : A child 's milestone can be a mother 's meltdown . I was completely prepared for my son Sam 's " separation " from me on his first day of preschool-or so I thought . I 'd coached him on what to expect , and I was ready to deal with any jitters he might have . Yet as we stood on the sidewalk in front of the school , the sight of my not-quite-3-year-old son in his tiny sneakers and backpack filled me with such a sense of loss that my stomach wound itself into a knot . When Sam reached for his teacher 's hand and dutifully walked down the stone path leading to the building , another mom joked knowingly , " He did n't even look back ! " And then it hit me : When you 're a parent , you basically work yourself out of a job . Not only was my son going to grow apart from me , I was going to have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in a single moment . It 's a process that unfolds over years . Fortunately ( for us and for them ) , there 's a natural order to our kids ' development . Each bit of progress continually requires a child to separate or leave behind the familiar ; our task is to offer support and encouragement . To help smooth the way for you and your child , here 's what to expect , age by age : Babies In his first weeks , your baby 's almost entirely focused on you . But at about 4 months , as he starts noticing the world around him , stuffed animals , balls , and lamp cords all compete with you for attention . Toward the end of the first year , he 'll begin to point to things , wanting you to see what he sees . This means he understands himself in relation to other things as well as other people . " It 's no longer you and your baby staring into each other 's eyes , it 's both of you looking out at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coauthor of The Scientist in the Crib . It 's easy to feel pangs of regret as he moves from constant communion with you to being able to entertain himself with a rattle or learning to fall asleep by himself instead of being rocked . Yet these steps are reasons to celebrate . He feels secure enough to turn away from you because he knows you love him . One bittersweet milestone for many nursing moms : weaning . No matter when or why it happens , it 's perhaps one of the most symbolic stages of separation between mother and baby . " I weaned Lucinda at 13 months , " says Jessica Kowal of Seattle . " She was down to one feeding , and it just felt like the right time to do it . I 'd usually breastfeed her first thing in the morning , but instead my husband took her and gave her some cereal . She did n't even bat an eye . I hung around upstairs , waiting for her to ask for me . She never did , but I realized I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she 'd lost touch with her baby , but Lucinda still wanted her mommy time-after Dad fed her breakfast . " We developed a new way of cuddling ; she 'd lie on my chest and we 'd snuggle in bed . " Kowal soon realized that even though she was letting go , she could create other ways to stay close to her baby . Toddlers Although most of us think of toddlerhood as a time of tantrums and stubbornness , it 's really more the " Age of Separateness . " Your child will test her discovery that she has a mind of her own in all its dimensions-especially with you . That 's why she 'll insist on the blue , not purple , cup and demand to wear her tutu to the park . While it may seem like she 's turning into a little tyrant , speaking her mind is key to learning what it feels like to be a separate person . But since these episodes fray even the most relaxed mom 's nerves , it can help to remind yourself ( while you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important stage of development . What your toddler 's really saying is , " In order to find myself , I need to defy you ! " But even as your child enjoys her newfound independence , she 'll probably also go through a bout of separation anxiety . Kids between 10 and 18 months can be notoriously clingy , and may become completely unglued when left with another caregiver . " Sam was perfectly content being dropped off at daycare when he was an infant , " says his mom , Nicole Raphaelson , of Hingham , Massachusetts . But at 22 months he 'd start to cry as soon as she started to pack his lunch box in the morning since he knew what was coming . " I tried to distract him by asking him something like , " Do you want to bring a blankie or a toy ? ' ' " says Raphaelson . It took about four months to ride it out , and eventually he readjusted to daycare . The key to making separation anxiety more bearable for the two of you : consistency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a parting ritual-and stick to it . Do n't linger or make a fuss if your toddler gets upset ( easier said than done , I know ) . You might say , " Momma 's going bye-bye now , " but always add , " I 'll be back ! " Then kiss your squirmy , oatmeal-covered sweetie goodbye and wave as you walk out the door . Soon , the " bye-bye " kiss-and-wave routine will become , well , routine . Preschoolers For most 3- and 4-year-olds-and their moms-the most stressful hurdle involves the first day of school . The smell of fresh crayons and the sight of a cubby almost seem like triggers for another round of separation anxiety . Jane Bernstein of Larchmont , New York , a mom of three , ages 9 , 7 , and 6 , found the process to be completely different with each of her kids . At the nursery school all three went to , parents had to stay until their child was ready to say goodbye . " With my oldest , Joby , I sat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only one left ! " She and Joby 's teacher decided to change the routine to see if he might feel more comfortable separating if all the kids started the morning outside on the playground . The strategy worked . " When my second child started school , I cleared my calendar for two months-I was ready to sit there ! " Bernstein laughs . " But he did n't need me at all . " The same rule for dealing with a toddler 's separation anxiety applies here , too : Whenever possible , keep your goodbyes short and upbeat . Preschoolers are n't just separating from you physically . Around age 4 , kids can understand that their thoughts are private-and that 's empowering . A child who is aware that he 's little and weak can try to comfort himself by imagining he 's a hero on a big white horse , or a preschooler who once confided everything to you might invent an imaginary friend to whom he reveals his thoughts instead . Let him experiment with his new notion of privacy-do n't push for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But you can always add , " Okay , but if you feel like telling me later you can . " ( Of course , if he seems upset , coax him a little more-you do n't want him to bottle up his feelings . ) In the end , your child 's not only developing a sense of individuality , he 's also developing his ability to manage himself-physically and emotionally . Grade-schoolers A child between 6 and 12 is still learning how to be autonomous , and is sorting out increasingly complex inner feelings . When my youngest son , James , was in the third grade , he started writing in his diary and hiding it in a box full of " treasures " under his bed . Whereas a younger child depends on you for reassurance , at this age she 's defining herself by how others , such as her friends and classmates , see her . She 'll also have preferences and make choices that are n't always dictated by you . This shift does n't mean she does n't need you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounding board as she tries out new ideas . Simply be there for her as she explores . Offer guidance when she needs it rather than pushing her toward a particular path . As a quiet , trustworthy presence , she 'll turn to you in times of stress , when your help will benefit her-and be appreciated-most . Even so , she 'll no doubt protect her desire for privacy . " Every parent wishes she could be a fly on the wall , " says Karen Springen , mom of Jazzy , 8 , of suburban Chicago . " I want to know every last detail of what happened in school . My daughter still tells me , but I can tell that sometimes she 's torn about it . She 'll speak a little more softly , and she 'll wait until right before bedtime to talk . " Although most of us feel like we 're fishing at the end of the day , there comes a point when we need to step back and respect our kids ' privacy . It might be as simple as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't already posted a Knock Before Entering ! sign ) , or telling her little brother he has to ask before he borrows her M player . When you think about it , almost all the hard decisions a mom makes ( Is it okay to leave her with a sitter for the night ? Should I let him walk to school by himself ? ) are about giving up control , as opposed to tightening your grip ; about relinquishing power , not gaining it . The whole point of raising children , after all , is to nurture a separate individual-someone who is n't afraid to disagree with us , who can choose to leave us , and who might even make serious mistakes . I believe that each time my kids pull away from me , they 'll return on a more mature level-and our relationship will be all the richer for it . In the end , being a mom means falling utterly in love , yet knowing that one day soon not only will your babies be gone , they 'll leave you for others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay great attention while nudging them gently out of the nest .

I keep reminding myself that it must be exciting for him to play , and I just appreciate those stolen hugs and kisses even more . " - JOANNA COSGROVE , MEDIA , PA " At about twelve months , my daughter stopped wanting to come home with me from daycare . She was having too much fun with her friends . It broke my heart , but I found other moms online who had the same experience , which made me feel better .
