1 WASHINGTON , DC JANUARY Irene Kennedy looked out at the white landscape from her seventh-floor office . Three fresh inches of snow had fallen overnight . The capital had a majestic winter wonderland feel to it when it snowed . It tended to be the kind of wet , heavy snow that coated every branch , statue , and park bench . The city looked frozen in time , and in a sense it was . A lame-duck president occupied 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , and the president-elect was one week away from taking his oath of office . Traditionally , the only business that got done the week before the inauguration was the business of pardons . Lawyers , lobbyists , and big-money players lined up to ask the president to forgive someone for a crime they had committed , or been accused of committing . Politics had gotten so rough that sometimes just being a friend of the president could bring about the unwanted attention of a special prosecutor . With that attention also came a mountain of legal bills . It was quickly becoming a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make these legal problems go away . Pardons could also be about bricks and mortar . A new presidential library needed to be built , and they were not cheap . With thispresident , however , it was mostly about setting things right . This should have been on Kennedy 's mind , but it was n't . As director of the Central Intelligence Agency she should have been lobbying for a blanket pardon herself , but her mind was occupied with the here and now . This transition period between presidential administrations was always stressful , but even more so this time . The nation was without decisive and focused leadership until the new administration took over , and that left them vulnerable . To make matters worse , the word was out that the new administration was going to clean house . This was no surprise to Kennedy . She knew the minute the election results came in that she was out of a job . Actually , she knew several weeks earlier when the CIA 's Global Ops Center called to alert her of the attack on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Josh Alexander had been hit by a car bomb . Alexander and his running mate had narrowly escaped . Their limousine had been flipped by the blast of the bomb , but the structural integrity of the outer shell held . Alexander walked away unharmed while his running mate , Mark Ross , suffered a separated shoulder and a cut above his left eye . The second limousine did not fare as well . The front third of the vehicle collapsed under the blast and exposed Alexander 's wife and three Secret Service agents to the superheated gases of the explosion . All four people were virtually incinerated . Fifteen other individuals were also killed , and another thirty-four were wounded , seven of them critically . An al-Qaeda splinter group had released a statement the week before the attack that they were going to disrupt the American elections . In the immediate aftermath of the explosion , Kennedy had a pretty good idea how the American people would react to such foreign intervention in the democratic process . Two weeks later they proved her right . They turned out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark Ross were swept into office by a landslide . Shortly after the election Ross began making statements to the press that he was going to do a top-down review of the CIA . That was code for cleaning house . Despite twenty-three years of service , Kennedy took none of this personally . It simply was n't worth it . The people had spoken , and in one week there would be the peaceful transfer of power from one administration to another . Her chief focus for this last week would be to purge every possible piece of information that could come back and bite her , or any of her people , in the ass . Part of her unpleasant history with Ross was that he was a vindictive prick . Simply running her out of the job after two brief years as the first female director of the Agency might not be enough for him . Kennedy felt there was a real chance he would want to burn her at the stake , tie her up in investigations for the next decade . She made a mental note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all she 'd done it would not be out of line to do so . Kennedy took her eyes off the frozen landscape and checked her watch . They were late . It must be the snow , she thought to herself . It was a Saturday morning , and Kennedy worked most Saturday mornings . At least for another week . For all she knew , they 'd take away her pass and cardkey when she showed up for work a week from Monday . That would be Ross 's style . He 'd make it as painful and embarrassing as possible . There was an upside to all of this . At least , that was what she kept telling herself . At forty-five , she 'd given twenty-three years of her life to the CIA . She had a beautiful ten-year-old son whom she did n't get to spend enough time with . Soon he would enter that stage where he would want nothing to do with her . This premature departure from the Agency would give her a chance to spend more time with him . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way out . She 'd already received two offers from local universities to teach , three from think tanks , and another from a private security firm . That was without lifting a finger . She tried to stay positive . Tried to tell herself they were great options , but in the end nothing else would match the mission and the people she worked with . That was what bothered her most . There was a knock on the door and then it opened . Kennedy smiled when she saw it was Skip McMahon . " Sorry I 'm late , " said the hulking six-foot-four FBI special agent . " People in this town lose their minds when it snows . " " It 's a good thing it 's a Saturday . " McMahon was holding a large briefcase . He crossed the room and kissed Kennedy on the cheek . " So what 's this all about ? Have you finally decided to announce your intention to marry me and make me an honest man ? " Kennedy smiled and gestured toward the sitting area . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink tea ? " She poured him a cup of coffee while McMahon sat on the couch . He kept the briefcase close . Kennedy handed him the cup and sat in one of the wing chairs . The FBI man gestured with his hands and said , " I half expected you to have all of your stuff boxed up and ready to go . " Kennedy sipped her tea . " Do you know something I do n't ? " " Funny . " McMahon looked around the wood paneled office ignoring her feigned naivet . The walls were covered with photos of people and places . Some of the photos were self-explanatory : former CIA directors , the Twin Towers , the Berlin Wall . Others were more obscure : a baby 's hand wrapped around a father 's finger , a demolished building with a man standing in the foreground sobbing , and a group of Arab women covered in black from head to toe walking down a dusty street . McMahon had been to the office many times . A naturally inquisitive person , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response was always the same . She simply smiled and changed the subject . It occured to him that this might be his last chance to glean the importance of the more cryptic shots . " The photo of the Arab women in black . Is that Saudi Arabia ? " " No . Yemen . " " Why do you have it in a frame ? " " It 's a reminder of the subjugation of women in the Arab culture . " McMahon nodded . " That 's what I thought . " Kennedy began laughing . " What ? " asked McMahon . " It 's not a reminder of the subjugation of Arab women . It 's actually a team of Delta Force commandos who were on their way to say hello to an individual who , let 's just say , was n't playing by the rules . " " You 're shitting me ? " McMahon stood up so he could examine the photo more closely . " Who were they going after ? " " That 's classified . " " Did they get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McMahon settled back into his spot on the couch . " So what 's the deal with the meeting this morning ? " " Do you know Cap Baker ? " " The Republican strategist . " " Yes . " " He 's the mystery person you dragged me out here to see ? " " He assured me it was in your best interest . " A scowl of irritation fell across McMahon 's leathered face . " Why in the hell would I want to spend two minutes with a political whore , especially a Republican one ? " Kennedy looked at her watch and ignored the question . " Why the hell did n't he just come see me at the Hoover Building ? " Before Kennedy could answer , there was a knock on the door . A second later it opened and Cap Baker entered . If it were n't for his signature shock of gray hair they might not have recognized him . They were used to seeing him on TV wearing suits , expensive shirts , and fancy ties . He was rumored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lobbying skills . This morning he was dressed in boots , khakis , and a plaid flannel shirt . A puffy winter jacket was held under his right arm . A second man , wearing a suit , followed him into the room . " Sorry we 're late , " announced Baker in his deep baritone voice . " The roads are horrible . " Kennedy stood to meet the visitors . " That 's all right . " She extended her hand . " Cap . " Baker took it . " Thank you for seeing me . I know this is a bit unusual . " McMahon stood but stayed silent . Baker turned to the FBI man . " I promise you , Special Agent McMahon , this will not be a waste of your time . " As if he could sense McMahon 's disdain , Baker did n't bother to offer his hand . Instead , he gestured to the man who had followed him into the office . " This is my attorney , Charles Wright . He wo n't be staying long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sit . " McMahon and Kennedy took their seats , and Baker and his attorney grabbed two smaller chairs opposite McMahon . Kennedy gestured to the tea and coffee service on the table , but before she could speak , Baker declined . " No , thank you . I have a plane waiting to take me to Vail . I need to get the hell out of this town before all the crazies start showing up for the inauguration . " " Vail , " McMahon said with feigned excitement , " I would have taken you for an Aspen man . " Baker smiled . " Aspen is a Democratic ski town , Agent McMahon . Vail is where us Republicans go . " " Life must be rough , " replied McMahon . Baker stared at the FBI man for a moment . The smile on his face was one of amusement . " I like you . You 're an open book . You do n't know me , but you do n't like me , and that 's fine because in about five minutes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never going to see each other again . " " Is that right ? " asked an amused McMahon . " Yep . . . and you 're never going to forget this meeting . " " Why 's that ? " " Because what I 'm about to give you is going to change your life . " " Is that right ? " McMahon did n't sound too convinced . " Yep , but before we get started , there 's one piece of business we need to take care of . " Baker looked to his attorney and nodded . The attorney opened his large briefcase and extracted a file . He handed the file to Baker , who opened it and grabbed three contracts . He kept one for himself and handed the other two to Kennedy and McMahon . " What 's this ? " asked McMahon . " Confidentiality agreement , " answered Baker . " I 'd tell you to read it , but I do n't have that much time . Just turn it to the last page and sign and date . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this over with . " " This is bullshit . " McMahon tossed the contract on the table . " I 'm not signing anything . " Baker looked to Kennedy , who was speed-reading through the document . " Irene ? " Without looking up , she asked , " Cap , tell me why it would be in my interest to sign this . " " It 's not in your interest . It 's in mine . But if you want to see what I have inside that briefcase , you 're going to have to sign this contract . " " Why us ? " asked McMahon . " Good question . " Baker placed his hands on his knees and thought about it for a second . " Three reasons where you 're concerned , Special Agent McMahon . The first , as far as feds are concerned , you 're someone who is known for his discretion . The second , what I 'm about to show you 're a son of a bitch , you hate politicians , and you ca n't be bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said flatly . " Yeah , " Baker grinned , " but the last three kind of go together , so we 'll just count them as one . " " He 's hard to argue with , " smiled Kennedy . She then turned to Baker and asked , " Why me ? " " That 's easy . I lived in awe of Thomas Stansfield and so did you . He was a good friend . . . a mentor . This town has never had anyone who worked so effectively behind the scenes . Before he died he told me to keep an eye on you . He also told me that you were someone I could trust . " Kennedy pulled off her reading glasses and looked at Baker . Thomas Stansfield had occupied this very office until cancer took his life two years earlier . He had also been a mentor to Kennedy . He was the greatest man she had ever known and he had told her the same thing about Baker . Without further thought , Kennedy flipped the contract to the last page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you doing ? " asked McMahon . Kennedy slid the contract in front of Baker so he could sign . " Skip , just sign it so we can get this over with . I do n't think Cap would have gone to this effort if it was n't something serious . " " But I need to run this by Justice . I ca n't just go around signing confidentiality agreements while I 'm on the government dime . " Kennedy glanced at him sideways . " Since when do you care about what Justice thinks ? Just let go of your control issues and sign it . " Kennedy handed him her pen . McMahon hesitated for a second and then took it and signed his name . " If this comes back and bites me in the ass , I 'm going to make someone 's life miserable . " Baker laughed as he took the contract from McMahon . " Do n't worry , in about two minutes this contract is going to be the least of your worries . " The attorney finished notarizing the contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his hand and Wright gave him a legal-size manila envelope . " Thank you , Charles . Why do n't you wait for me down in the car . " The attorney left without saying a word , and when the door closed behind him McMahon said , " This better be pretty fucking good . " " That 's going to depend on how you look at it . " Baker stared at the mysterious envelope in his hands . " Let me ask you something , Agent McMahon . How is your investigation going ? " " That 's confidential . " " I hear it 's pretty one-dimensional . " " What 's that supposed to mean ? " Baker shrugged . " You guys are only looking at this one way . " " When all the evidence points in one direction , that 's pretty much the way it works . " " All the evidence ? From what I 've heard there is very little evidence . " " You know what ? I did n't come here to talk about my investigation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's time you put your cards on the table . " " Fine . " Baker nodded . He opened the sealed envelope and extracted a series of 8x10 black-and-white photographs . He turned the first one over and placed it on the coffee table so both McMahon and Kennedy could view it . It was a close-up of a woman . The photograph had the slightly grainy quality of a surveillance photo taken from a distance and then blown up . " That , if you did n't know it already , is Jillian Rautbort . President-elect Alexander 's deceased wife . " Baker grabbed a second photo and set it down next to the first . This one was not blown up . It showed Jillian Rautbort and a man . It was evening and they were standing on a terrace . Jillian was in a halter dress and the man was in a suit . Baker put down the next photo . This one was of just Jillian from the waist up . She had a very mischievous look on her face and she was reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy . " This is where it gets interesting , and I apologize in advance , but you need to see this . " He laid down the next photo . Jillian Rautbort was now standing with her dress around her waist ; her tanned and perfectly sized breasts exposed . Baker put the next photo down . Now Jillian and the man were kissing . The photo after that captured Jillian on her knees , her face buried in the mystery man 's groin . Baker began lying the photos down like a blackjack dealer would cards . They showed Rautbort and her lover in an escalation of sexual acts culminating with him on his back on a lounge chair and her completely naked on top of him . Baker placed the empty envelope on the table next to the photos and said , " That 's pretty much it . " " Are you sure , " asked Kennedy , " that the woman in these photos is Jillian Rautbort ? " " Yes . " " When were they taken , and how the hell did you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think they were taken over Labor Day at the Rautbort estate in Palm Beach , and no , I did n't hire someone to do this . " " Then how in the hell did you get your hands on them ? " " I was contacted by the man who took them , " replied Baker . McMahon scoffed . " So you did n't hire him , but in the end you paid him . " " There is a distinction , Agent McMahon . I 'm not going to sit here and tell you I 'm an angel . Politics is a rough business . Since you were willing to sign my confidentiality agreement , I 'll give you the straight facts . I paid for these photos . I paid a lot of money for these photos , and it was all legal . My only regret now is that I did n't destroy them the moment I received them . " " Why is that ? " asked Kennedy . " Because I allowed my ego to get in the way , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How could these photos have cost your candidate the White House ? " asked a skeptical McMahon . " There are very few people in the world who I truly despise . Mark Ross and Stu Garret are two of them . " Kennedy and McMahon shared a look , and McMahon said , " You 'll get no argument from us . " " Well , with a month to go in the race , my guys had an eight-point lead , which , if you know how polls are conducted  --  who answers their phone , who does n't , who says they vote , and who actually votes , and all these national polls have a built-in bias for the Democrats  --  with four weeks to go is huge , especially if you 're on the Republican ticket . I never really wanted to buy these photos , and I certainly never wanted to use them . At least , not in terms of releasing them to the press . " " Then why did you buy them ? " asked McMahon . " To take them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right . Elections are about controlling as many factors as possible , and I 'll be damned if I was going to allow these things to float around and do God only knows what . The conventional wisdom would be that they would hurt the Alexander camp , but one never knows for sure . The smart thing is to leave nothing to chance . We were flush with cash , so I paid the guy . " " That was the only reason why you bought them ? " Kennedy asked in a slightly skeptical tone . Baker grinned . " There was one other small reason . " He shifted in his chair and crossed his right leg over his left . " I wanted to make Garret and Ross sweat . " " You sent them these ? " McMahon asked with his mouth agape . " Only a few . I had them personally delivered to Garret 's hotel room during a campaign stop in Dallas . " " Did he know you sent them ? " " No . " " Are you sure ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure the delivery could n't be traced back to me . I did , however , send a message along . " " What kind of message ? " " I only sent three photos . I wrote one word with a black Sharpie on each photo . " " What word ? " " Three words . You 'll never win . " " You and Garret have a history ? " asked Kennedy . " You could say that . We 've been on the opposite sides of some pretty big battles . " " And let me guess , " said McMahon , " one of your favorite sayings with him was , You 'll never win . " " Actually , he was the one who was fond of the saying . " " So you thought you 'd rub his nose in it . " Baker nodded . " And if I 'd just left it alone , I 'd be the one getting ready for an inauguration , and they , " Baker pointed at the photos on the table , " would still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked McMahon . " Jillian and the man she had the rendezvous with . " McMahon picked up one of the photos and pointed to the person underneath Jillian Rautbort . " This man is dead ? " " That man is Special Agent Matt Cash of the United States Secret Service . " Continues ...
