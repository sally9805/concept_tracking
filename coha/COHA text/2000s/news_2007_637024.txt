<p> As I watch couples frolicking down the hallways every Valentine 's Day , reality hits me : I am 17 years old , and I am not allowed , nor will I ever be allowed , to go on a date . Instead , my Monopoly card says , " Go straight to marriage . Pass boyfriends , romantic holidays or quarrels , but go straight to marriage . " <p> This is not because my parents are excessively overprotective . It is because in my culture , my marriage will be arranged . <p> Yes , you read correctly . My parents have the responsibility of choosing my husband for me . Even though many of you might cringe at the prospect of an arranged marriage , I actually have no reservations about the idea . Why not have an arranged marriage ? It will be one less thing I will have to stress about . Not having the added responsibility of having to choose the man with whom I will spend the rest of my life also gives me a chance to concentrate on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage is not usually a forced marriage in which the son or daughter has no say in the decision . Nor is it set up when the child is born . That was a very old ritual . Many Asian countries , such as Pakistan , India and China , have been practicing this tradition since the dawn of time . <p> Like most everything , the practice of arranged marriages has been modernized to better suit the mentality of the children and their environment . Nowadays , arranged marriages are parents setting their kids up with a suitable mate and letting the two decide if they want to get married . <p> The process of an arranged marriage is similar to that of a matchmaking company , except the marriage brokers are usually the aunts and close relatives of the family . When the family realizes the time has come to get their beloved son married , they send out the message to their relatives to start searching for a " nice " girl . <p> The busybody aunts then start scoping out prospective girls . This is usually done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and judge everything about the girl , from her hair color to the way she walks . One could compare it to an episode of " America 's Next Top Model . " <p> Once they find a suitable girl , they inform the parents of the guy . The parents tell their son all about the girl , and then the guy makes his decision . Then the boy 's parents take the proposal of marriage to the girl 's parents . <p> Now it is the girl 's parent 's turn to find out as much as they can about the guy . Since it is concerning their daughter 's life , they are quite thorough in their research about the prospective husband and his family . Finding out about his family is extremely important , too , because in most cases , the couple usually lives with the groom 's family after the marriage . <p> After the girl 's parents think the guy is suitable and their daughter will be happy with him , they take the proposal to the girl . If she says yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champagne . <p> The celebration consists of the girl 's parents hosting a gathering for the other family to let the children meet and confirm the engagement . Although it is unconventional for the two children to actually date before the engagement , the two are given the time to speak to each other in a supervised setting . <p> After the engagement , depending on the leniency of the families , the engaged couple is allowed to meet and talk to each other all they want . However , even after they are engaged , it is not like a normal dating scene . Displays of affection would be considered disgraceful , so " making out " is out of the question . Also going out on dates can be acceptable , but parents usually send siblings with them . <p> Though arranging marriages appears to be a long and arduous process , it is my understanding that they have lower divorce rates than non-arranged marriages , most often called love marriages . <p> One of the reasons for this may be because in an arranged marriage , the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The girl and the guy both have to worry about the reputation of their families if their marriage does not work out . <p> Another reason for the success of arranged marriages is because the girl and guy do not have as high expectations for each other as those of a couple who were in a relationship before they got married . The relationship of the couple grows as they find out more and more about each other . As their marriage strengthens , their love does as well , not the other way around . In the words of Meredith Grey , on the popular television show " Grey 's Anatomy , " " The unexpected is what changes our lives . " <p> I am not an average teenage girl in high school . Even my parents admit that . But like most girls , I am nervous about what the future holds for me . I am worried whether I will ever find my soul mate , scared that I might become the lady with 100 cats , especially since I am scared of cats . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those fears . Even though arranged marriages may still seem like an archaic practice , they beat the angst of first dates , the wait for the phone to ring and the tiring search for your soul mate in the sea of people . <p> My parents , grandparents , aunts and uncles all had their parents arrange their marriages , and they are all happy with their lives . As old-fashioned as it seems , I look forward to keeping this tradition . <p> * Anum Ghazipura attends Lakeside High School in DeKalb County . <p> New Attitudes is a weekly opinion column written by readers between the ages of 15-22 .
