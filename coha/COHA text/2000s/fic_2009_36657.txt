INSPECTOR MAX FITI had great significance in a place that had little . He was the head of police in Ketanu , a small town in the Adaklu-Anyigbe District of Ghana 's Volta Region . All he had was a small police station as ragged as a stray dog , two constables , and an old police vehicle that ran erratically , but when there was trouble , people turned to Fiti . <br> Case in point : Charles Mensah , a fortyish man with a painfully thin body and a bulbous head like a soldier termite , had just come into his office this morning to report his sister missing . <br> " When did you last see Gladys ? " Fiti asked . <br> " Yesterday afternoon , around three , " Charles said . " Just before she left for Bedome . " <br> " She went to Bedome ? To do what ? " <br> " You know she 's a volunteer with the Ghana Health Service AIDS outreach . She goes to different villages to teach and so on . " " Aha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east of Ketanu on the other side of the forest . <br> " When she did n't come back home yesterday evening , " Charles continued , " I thought it was strange , so I rang her mobile and left a message . She never called back and I started to get worried , so then I rang Timothy Sowah , the director of the AIDS program , and he said he too had been unable to reach her on the mobile . " <br> " Maybe she went to another village where the reception is poor ? " Fiti suggested . <br> " Mr. Sowah told me Bedome was the only place she was scheduled to visit , " Charles replied . <br> " Are you sure she actually got to Bedome ? I mean , not that I 'm saying something bad happened on the way , but- " <br> " I understand what you mean , Inspector . I got up early this morning-I could n't sleep anyway-and I went to Bedome to check . Everyone told me yes , that Gladys had been there yesterday and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ketanu . " True , less than twenty-four hours had passed , Fiti reflected , but he agreed this was all very troubling . Gladys Mensah was a serious girl- reliable , solid , and smart . And beautiful . Very , very lovely indeed . So , yes , Fiti took this seriously . He jotted some notes on a legal pad , sitting slightly sideways because his rotund belly prevented him from pulling up close to his desk . Fiti was approaching the half-century mark in age , and most of the weight he had recently been gaining had gone to his midsection . <br> " Something else I want to tell you , " Charles said . " Maybe it 's nothing , but while I was on my way to Bedome this morning , I spoke to some farmers who have their plots near the forest . They told me that while they were working yesterday evening , they saw Samuel Boateng talking to Gladys as she was on her way back to Ketanu . " <br> Inspector Fiti 's eyes narrowed . " Is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family much . Samuel , the second oldest boy , was a ruffian who had once stolen a packet of PK chewing gum from a market stall . <br> " Have you asked Samuel or his father about it ? " Fiti said . <br> " We do n't speak to the Boatengs , " Charles said tersely . <br> Fiti pressed his lips together . " Do n't worry , I 'll go and see them myself . " <br> Chapter Two <br> EFIA WAS A TROKOSI , which meant that she belonged to the gods . Eighteen years ago , her uncle Kudzo beat a man to death with a branch from a baobab tree . Over the next several months , bad things began to happen to the family : crops failed because of drought , Efia 's mother had a stroke , and a cousin drowned in a river . Everyone in the family panicked . Even though Uncle Kudzo had been imprisoned for his crime , it appeared the gods were punishing the family for what he had done . This was the only reasonable explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , and who knew how many more catastrophes were to be meted out by the gods ? <br> The family elders went to the Bedome shrine to consult with Togbe Adzima , chief and High Priest of the village . Adzima , who was an intermediary between the physical world and the spirit world , said yes , there was most certainly a way out of this predicament . The family needed to bring a female child to serve at the shrine . Efia , twelve at the time , was the perfect choice . She was handed over to Adzima to learn " moral ways . " This would restore good fortune to the family . As a trokosi , though , she officially belonged to the gods and was to bear their children through Togbe Adzima . He had three other trokosi and nineteen children among them . The wives cooked for him , cleaned , made palm wine , and harvested crops . Every penny from the sale of foodstuffs went to him . And there lay the heart of the matter . Whatever the supposed reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being sometimes loftily called " wives of the gods , " they were the source of all Togbe 's plenty , and that made life very good for him . Whenever Efia looked back on the day her new life as a trokosi began , she flinched with the pain of the memory . She and the extended family had walked about sixteen kilometers from their home village to the shrine , bearing all kinds of gifts for Togbe . Efia did n't understand why she was being cleaved from her family . She cried and cried and could not stop . <br> The shrine itself was a low mud hut containing a large , brightly painted wood carving plastered with human and animal figures . The gods endowed this carved object with magical powers that the priest could summon whenever needed . That 's why it was often called a " fetish object " and the priest a " fetish priest , " even though many of the priests did n't like the word fetish used to describe them . <br> Efia remembered entering another hut close to the shrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a northern desert in there , smelly and stifling . Efia knelt down in front of Togbe and two other priests . They poured libation with schnapps and drank up whatever was left in the bottle . Togbe , sweat dripping off his face and body , chanted magic words and waved an oxtail fly whisk over different shrine objects . <br> Every stitch of Efia 's clothing was removed , and a female elder inspected her to make sure she was a virgin . As Efia bowed down in obeisance to the fetish objects , she felt as if she would be choked to death by the smoky heat and the alcohol breath of the men . <br> But she did n't die . She survived . Her family left her in Bedome and she began her life at the shrine . She never tried to run away . The gods would punish her for that , and anyway , where would she go ? Once Efia had reached puberty , Togbe Adzima began to have sex with her . At the age of sixteen , she had her first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Efia had missed her period last month and she could tell she was pregnant again . She had suffered two miscarriages since Ama was born . Her second live child , a boy , had died of malaria before he reached the age of one . <br> Togbe Adzima would want to eat plantain fufu for lunch . Balancing an empty basket on her head without the aid of her hands , Efia walked through the thick bush of the forest toward the plantain grove . Her feet , broad and solid from years of walking , easily passed over the tricky terrain of low shrubs , dead leaves , fallen trees , and trailing vines . It had rained a little last night , and the moist earth was fragrant . Overhead in the trees , birds filled the crisp air with bright morning song . <br> As she came level with a palm tree , she caught a glimpse of an animal on the ground barely a second before she stepped on it . Snake . She jumped to the side with natural quickness . But when she looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a human foot , toes pointing up . <br> Efia put down her basket and moved slowly around the palm tree . She saw a woman lying on her back partially obscured by the branches of a low shrub . She was fully clothed . Her legs were together , her arms by her sides . Sleeping ? <br> " Heh ! " Efia called out . " Hello ? " <br> She came forward two steps , pulled the branches aside , and when she saw the face , the wide-open eyes and the gaping mouth , she recoiled and her blood went cold . <br> No . " Gladys ? " In a way , Gladys seemed different , in another way she looked the same . Efia touched her and was shocked by how cold and rigid she was . Her eyes were open but unmoving and cloudy white , as though filled with coconut milk . <br> " Gladys . " Efia began to cry . " Ao , Gladys , wake up , wake up . Gladys ! " <br> She got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but no one was close by . She began to run . Her vision darkened , her hearing deadened , and her feet lost sensation . <br> She burst out of the bush and spotted a man walking ahead along the Bedome-Ketanu footpath , and she ran after him screaming . He stopped and turned around , and as Efia got closer she recognized him as Isaac Kutu , the local herbalist and healer . His compound was not far away . She felt a surge of hope . Healer . Maybe he can do something . <br> " Mr. Kutu . " She was gasping , trying to catch her breath . " Mr. Kutu , please come . " <br> " What 's wrong ? " <br> " It 's Gladys Mensah . Hurry ! " <br> Efia turned and began to run back . She could hear Mr. Kutu keeping up behind her . The bush seemed thicker and more tangled now that her energy was so spent , but she knew the way well and got there quickly . <br> The body was still there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands on her knees to get her breath . <br> Mr. Kutu pulled aside the obscuring bush and drew back at the sight . He stared for a moment and then knelt down by the body . He touched it softly and whispered something Efia did n't catch . He looked stunned . <br> Kutu stood up . " Bring me something to cover her . " <br> Several plantain trees , their leaves long and broad , were only a few feet away . Efia pulled on a branch and broke it off . Kutu laid it gently across Gladys 's body . It seemed much better that way , so much more dignified . <br> " I have to go and get Inspector Fiti , " Kutu said . " Can you wait here for us to come back ? " <br> Efia backed away , shaking her head . " No . I 'm afraid to stay with her by myself . " <br> She turned and bolted back to Bedome without stopping or looking back . <br> Including the shrine , Bedome was a collection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stained the soil dark , but once it dried out , it would be the identical monotonous light brown color of the dwellings . <br> The normal morning 's activities-sweeping , cooking , collecting water , the smaller children playing-had begun , but everything stopped as Efia came running . She collapsed to the ground wheezing with exhaustion , her face buried in her palms . The trokosi wives came to her at once , dropping down beside her . What 's wrong , what 's the matter ? <br> Efia could n't speak . She was paralyzed with shock . Nunana , the oldest , most experienced wife , her body worn and wiry and her breasts wrung dry by the toll of six children , pulled Efia up and led her protectively away . <br> " What happened ? " she said softly . And suddenly more sharply , " Stop crying and tell me what 's wrong . " <br> As Efia was sobbing out her answer , Togbe Adzima came out of his hut shirtless and yelled , " What are you people doing standing around like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifties . He was oily and never looked clean , and his eyes were red and muddy from drinking . <br> " Nunana ! " <br> She came to him quickly . <br> " What 's going on ? " he demanded . <br> " Please , Togbe . Efia says Gladys Mensah is dead in the forest . " <br> " What ? " " She found her at the plantain grove . " <br> " When ? " <br> " Just now , Togbe . " <br> He looked baffled . He beckoned Efia over , and the children of the shrine fell in behind her , eyes wide with curiosity . <br> " What are you saying , Efia ? " <br> She repeated what she had told Nunana . Togbe Adzima frowned . " Are you sure ? " <br> Efia nodded . She tried to wipe her tears away , but they kept pouring . <br> Adzima went into his hut and came back out buttoning his shirt . " I 'm going to see for myself . Finish your work . Make sure my akasa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' home was a ramshackle house on its last legs . When Inspector Fiti entered , Mr. Boateng looked wary and his wife was visibly nervous . She offered Fiti some water , which he dismissed as if she had suggested poison . Four of the seven children were at home , all of them in tattered clothing . <br> " Where is Samuel ? " Fiti asked in Ewe . <br> " Please , Inspector , he went with some friends to somewhere , " Boateng said . <br> " Find him , " Fiti said . " I want to talk to him . Right now . " <br> Boateng 's eight-year-old son went to look for Samuel and came back with him a few minutes later . Samuel was nineteen , compact and wiry , the striations of his ropy muscles showing through his faded shirt . Chale-wate sandals clung to his muddy feet by threads . He looked suspiciously from the inspector to his parents . <br> " Sit on the floor , " Fiti told him . <br> Samuel 's face was fluid and mobile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical manifestation of his mind at work . He sat down looking both wary and defiant . The inspector moved closer and stood over him . <br> " Have you seen Gladys Mensah today ? " Samuel 's brow furrowed . " Please , no , sir . " <br> " What about yesterday ? Did you see her ? " <br> " Yesterday ? No , sir . " <br> " Do n't lie , boy . Some farmers saw you with her . " <br> " No , sir . It was n't me . " <br> " Hello , Inspector ? " <br> Everyone turned in the direction of the voice . Isaac Kutu was standing at the door . <br> " Yes ? " Fiti saw the grave look on Isaac 's face . " What 's the matter ? " <br> " You should come , Inspector . Gladys Mensah is dead . " <br> Chapter Three <br> BAD NEWS SPREADS THROUGH any small town like fire through dry savanna bush . Kweku and Osewa Gedze first heard about Gladys Mensah 's death as they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pods were particularly beautiful this year . Each was perfectly almond shaped with sculptured ridges that ended in a point like an erect nipple . One pod held thirty to forty fleshy seeds that were scooped out , fermented , and then dried for days before they were ready to be shoveled into sacks for shipping . It was back-splitting work , and for all of it Osewa and Kweku would probably never savor a single mini-square of the final product-chocolate . It all went to fancy stores in the big cities at prices that they could never dream of paying . <br> Kweku wiped the sweat off his face and watched his wife for a moment . She was on her knees deftly slashing the pods open with a cutlass . Fifty-one years old and nine years his junior , she was strong and skilled with powerful hands that wielded a cutlass or shovel better than most men . <br> Continues ...
