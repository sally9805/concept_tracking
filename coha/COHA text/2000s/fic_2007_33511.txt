Chapter One Johnny Rolfe To whoever is out there , if anyone is out there : Today has been an awful day in a run of awful days as long as life so far . The thirty of us climbed aboard this bus in haste , fled down the tunnel , and came up on the river 's far bank in time to see the Chrysler Building plunge into the earth . The grieving faces of my colleagues being worse to look at than that crumpling shaft of glass , brick , and steel , I used my knees to plug the sockets of my eyes , put my fingers in my ears , and clamped my nose and mouth shut with my thighs . All main entries to my head remained sealed till Delaware , where I looked up in time to see John Martin vault his seatback , steak knife aimed at George Kendall 's throat . Kendall , bread knife aimed at Martin 's throat , said , " How dare you say that ! " Some great , quaint pre-annihilation philosopher described the movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've seen a lot more thesis , antithesis , steak knife , bread knife . John and George jabbed each other 's arms once each before a couple guys broke up the fight , not because they did n't want to see George dead , or John dead , but because we 'd signed a contract with our employer stipulating no murder on the bus . Murders off the bus must be approved by a majority of the bus 's five-man board of directors . We do n't yet know who those five are : their names aresealed in a black box we 're meant not to open till we pass from Maryland into Virginia-that is , from civilization into its counterpart , if indeed civilization 's what to call what we 're fleeing , or exporting , or both . I am this trip 's communications specialist , having taken a degree from the Manhattan School of Communications Arts , where I received certificates in linguistics , diplomacy , typing , modern dance , telecom , short and long stick . A mile into Delaware a log or rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a halt . We 'd passed a trading post a mile back and all of us but three set out for it on foot . Our home having cracked sooner than we 'd thought it would , we left without a lot of things we need . Those men walked up the road with what they had to trade for food : small electric things , copper , beads , knives , love ; scarcity reveals the nature of exchange . The driver and mechanic fixed the bus while I sat here and called to my thoughts . None came . I gazed out the dirty bulletproof window at two plump red hares , creatures one sees none of on the island of my birth . " Say bullet-resistant glass not bulletproof glass because there 's no such thing as bulletproof glass and while that may be a technicality I would n't want to sell this glass to you under false pretext however slight , " the used bulletproof glass salesman said to me in my role as this trip 's communications specialist , back at home , three days before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be using the glass for ? " " For not dying , " I said , and put my fist in contact with his chin , the punishment for poor sales technique in modern-day New York . Stepping over his prone form , I put as much glass in my cart as would fit . Do n't judge me , if you exist . Show me a man who goes to sleep each night integrity intact and I will hit him in the chin with my fist and take his glass . I continued to console myself with the two red hares gently munching grasses in that roadside field-though what was road and what was field was not so easy to discern . Two weeks into spring , the hares seemed unperturbed to find the trees around them dead , all leaves brown and holed and half-mashed in the earth . I liked the hares and wished them all the best , but they were plump and I was starved enough to risk ingesting what toxins they might have contained . I pulled my bodkin from my sock and stood when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So low to the ground were these two new beasts that I could n't see their legs above the brown and desiccated grass ; they seemed to glide along this stiff , brown lake of blades . They tapered at the back end into bushy tails , and at the front end into meager heads each of which came to a point in a weapons-grade black nose . Their tone was frolicsome . They signaled to the hares their wish to play . The hares seemed angry . The brown rodents approached and were rebuffed , approached and were rebuffed , and by now the hares ' fiery fur stood on end while their bodies shook in place . The hares were puffed up very big and red and I sensed a miscommunication between these species of dumb beasts that looked like other miscommunications I 'd sensed or made . Never have I seen a hare open its mouth as wide as did the red hare who now bit the small head off the brown thing , whose red blood stained the stiff , brown grass . The second brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to not get caught by hare two and sheared in half . That was when I turned away and opted not to hunt the hares . The mechanic , Jack Smith , bounded up the bus 's stairs . He gave me a thumbs-up that transitioned into a wave . " Johnny ! How you doing ? We got the bus fixed . What 's with the sick , morose look ? " " Did you see what those hares did to those-other things ? " " That 's what you 're upset about ? That 's like being upset about earthquakes , or asteroids falling into the sea , or war , or having to breathe to stay alive . Think happy thoughts . " " And what would be a happy thought for you ? " " That I 'm alive . " " Great . " " Do n't be so pessimistic . We 'll get down to Virginia , trade with the Indians- " " ' Trade , ' right . " " Maybe someone like you 'll meet a nice Indian girl and fall in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Someone who believes in love . " " You do n't ? " " Love 's like me , it does its dirty job . People like you think love 's a virtue in itself . That 's why I like you . " " When people say ' That 's why I like you , ' they 're either about to swindle me or they 're laboring under a grave misapprehension . " " ' Laboring under a grave misapprehension , ' that 's cute . You contemplative types are such a gloomy bunch of freaks , " he said , and pinched my cheeks and kissed my ear and stepped down off the bus . The other guys returned . Their clothes were torn and fouled , their faces bruised . George Kendall , whose throat John Martin had tried to cut , was not among them . " What happened to Kendall ? " I said . " The less you know , the better , " Martin said . " Did you finally succeed in killing him ? " Martin lunged at me and Jack Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the bus as Smith knocked Martin to the ground . " Now get up and I 'll give you a hug , " he said . Martin stood , hugged Smith , and tried to stab him in the gut . Smith took his knife from him and sliced his forehead open . Night fell . We drove slowly down the blasted road . Smith stitched Martin 's head and dressed the wound and fed him soup and laid him down to sleep . I do n't like a bus of guys . Is there any bus of guys on which a man can hug and feed another soup without first having sliced his face ? Chapter Two Pocahontas To the excellent person I know is reading this : Hi ! My name is Pocahontas and I 'm nineteen , but Pocahontas is n't my real name . I will never say my real name . If I say my real name you will die . Anyone who hears my real name will die . Pocahontas is my nickname , it means " person who can not be controlled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my nickname , my mom did , before she died , and he 's kind of mad that that 's my nickname because every time someone says it-which is any time anyone says my name because anyone who says my name name will die , which has been proven , but right now I ca n't talk about that because in English , which is not my mom tongue , you can talk about only one thing at a time , at most-any time anyone says my nickname they 're also saying my dad ca n't control his daughter , and that 's bad for my dad , my dad claims , because he 's chief of our town and a bunch of other towns in this general area-Superchief , I think y'all might say in English . Oh English ! How I love to write to you in English , even though it is so slow to do anything in English , because English moves at the speed of talking , whereas my language moves at the speed of thinking . Thinking in English is beautiful sort of in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of busthead . When I think of the world in English , or look at the world in English , it moves so slow , like English , and that feels good cuz life 's so short ! Like when I look , in English , at my two little cousins , Opechancanough and Steve , throwing a ball back and forth between them in a meadow or former parking lot , the ball slides along the air as a snail slides along the sand , and leaves a furrow of air in the air as thoughts of you , the excellent person I know is reading this , leave the faintest furrow in my brow . I want to tell you all about the sweet but kind of weird and sad day I had today , okay ? After I spent the morning working in the cornfields with my gal pals I was running around and around and around my dad 's house . My dad 's house is pretty neat , and contains many a mansion ! It 's shaped like the lowercase letter n , but as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one had a great black letter n in the exact center of it , so that there was a big stack of n 's all kind of connected to each other , and then you took a very sharp knife and cut away all the whiteness of all the paper surrounding the n 's , and were left with about five hundred black n 's stacked on top of one another , and then you tilted the stack so the n 's were standing on their feet , so you had a tunnel of n 's , which you lived in with your wife , who bore you a girl when you wanted a boy , or thought you wanted a boy , but you found you loved the girl so much you let her disobey your rules , and so on , so that 's what my dad 's house looks like , which I was running around and around , a thing a girl my age wo n't do for much longer , it just ai n't right , who knows why , gon na have to find another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well so I 'm running when this guy , my favorite second cousin , Stickboy , came up to me and asked me to take a walk with him in the woods , and I said yes , why not , it 's always good to spend time with him . Stickboy 's smart , and knows things no one else knows , but few acknowledge this . His dad was killed before he was born and his mom , who is the cousin of my dad , came to live with us , and gave birth to Stickboy in our n-shaped house . Like I said , my dad had no boy , i.e. , heir , so Stickboy is supposed to take over the family business , which is executive-level politics , except for the little problem that no one thinks he 's up to the job . " Does n't kick , " my father said , with his hand on his cousin 's womb a month before Stickboy came down the tunnel of her cunt and out into this vale of tears . " What kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And many years later-now-when my father enters a room Stickboy is already in , Stickboy , without thinking , brings his hands up to his chest as if to defend his heart from a barb my dad would fling at it , and my dad says , " What are you doing , covering your breasts ? " and both man and boy wince , boy cuz he wants my dad to love him , man cuz he knows he flings the barb at the heart of his adopted son cuz the boy 's weakness reminds him of his own and he 's therefore , in a sense , flinging a barb at his own heart . Is n't life sometimes complicated and sad ? I walked with Stickboy out into the woods . I want to write a fabulous description of the woods for you in the exciting language of English , but it 's going to be hard . I do n't know the English names of woodsy things . There 's a kind of moss that 's soft and green and smells like the neck of my mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll call this moss mom 's neck . Mom 's neck drips or droops from the branches of the trees . The branches have leaves that fall off in autumn and grow back in spring . The leaves in the spring are green and round or spear-shaped or heart-shaped or radiant . The air in the woods this time of year is wet and green . When I open my mouth in the woods it fills with green . When I speak in the woods my words come out green . If I think of someone I love , my thoughts are green . The woods also have the remnants of a defunct civilization that thrived on this very spot , so for every couple dozen trees there 'll be a brokedown edifice of years gone by . The woods have deadly creatures too but I 'll not say their names right now . Deeper and deeper into the forest went Stickboy and I. " I think we will not marry after all , " he said , which stopped me in mid-stride . " What ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What will prevent us ? " " The future . " " Why , whenever you talk about the future , do you sound as if you 're describing a country where only sad people live ? " " To counteract the nostalgia for the future that you and everyone else around here seem to feel . To counteract the nave idea that what makes the future good is that it 's the future . " Well it hit me pretty hard when he said that about him and me not getting married , an event we 'd been planning since we met at birth . I think he 's right but I do n't know why . Maybe he 's right because he said it . Does that ever happen in English , where saying something makes it true ? That happens in my language all the time so people have to be careful what they say but no one ever is , enough . Then some time passed in the woods that I do n't remember anything about , a little wedge of life that 's disappeared . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single word that caused a single feeling in my breast . The feeling I remember well , but not the word that was its maker . Ugh , I wish I had n't written this . Too late now . Chapter Three Johnny Rolfe To the one whose existence I doubt : We parallel the river 's southward course . Our progress is glacial . Long swathes of the old road are gone . Often we know we 're on what used to be the road only by the signs that remain on what used to be its side : FARMLAND-FRESH PRODUCE , BUMPER-TO-BUMPER AUTO PARTS , FRIENDLY MOTEL , MOOSE LODGE , CHRISTIANA CHICKEN SHACK , SHAFT OX CHIROPRACTIC , OASIS CAR WASH , MIRACLE DELIVERANCE TABERNACLE , SPEED LIMIT ENFORCED BY AIRCRAFT , DRUG-FREE SCHOOL ZONE : linguistic detritus of history , voices from a past we hope to reclaim , lonely notes our forebears wrote in code to tell us how to find them . WHISPERING PINES MOTEL , MASON-DIXON SPORTS COMPLEX , CRAFT EMPORIUM , SELF-EMPLOYED HEALTH INSURANCE , OTHELLO , BAIT AND TACKLE , TEMPERANCE , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed another trading post today . Everyone but Jack Smith , the red-haired mechanic , who 'd had to slice John Martin 's face , shunned this one . We stopped for lunch ; Smith removed a red wagon full of paltry trinkets from the trailer of supplies behind the bus and went to the post alone on foot . I gazed through the scuffed-up glass at the most compelling sign of all : I would have risked my life to find who made that sign , but the house it stood before and described had become a house-shaped square of ash , so I stayed put . An hour later Martin , whose face there was a little less of now , said , " Let 's leave without Smith . " " I 'm not going anywhere , " the driver said . Others said : " Let 's wait an hour , then go after him . " " Let 's wait an hour , then leave . " " Let 's kill him when he gets back , if he is n't already dead . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone long enough , something bad 's happened . " ( That was me . ) " Let 's send you in after him alone , " Martin said . I said , " I know it stings to get punked by someone of a lower social station , Martin . " He came at me along the bus 's wide central aisle , a blur of bandages deep brown with dried blood . I removed from my pocket the very handheld device on which I 'm now describing this and jammed it in his knee . He howled and fell and howled . He would n't walk again for hours at least , and thus I 'd saved him from a dozen fights , a munificent gesture , almost as if I 'd used this thing to communicate something of value . Against my own best sense , I want to know John Martin-not know him tactically to know what he 'll do next so I can do it to him first , I mean I want to know him in the useless way people know . He 's small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a dirty fighter with a high , elegant forehead . With his speed and size , his wont to bite and scratch , he fights well in a cramped space . The syllogism of his inclusion on this trip : he 's good at number crunching , he 'll bite off the finger of his assailant , let 's include him on this trip . And Martin 's a born executive-one of that class of men who make or know the secrets that define the contour of our lives without our knowledge , secrets one hundred molecules of which the rest of us inhale with every breath . You can tell he 's one of them by how he wears his suit . Even when it 's soiled and scuffed , stained with blood , and stinks of fear and rage , Martin 's suit attends his body as the air attends an eagle 's wing . (
