Cover of Night By Linda Howard Random House Linda Howard The guest who was staying in room 3 of Nightingale 's Bed and Breakfast , which Cate Nightingale privately thought of as the He-Man room because it was almost unrelievedly masculine , stopped in the doorway of the dining room , then almost immediately stepped back out of sight . Most of the patrons who were enjoying Cate 's morning offerings did n't even notice the man 's brief appearance ; those who did probably did n't think anything about his abrupt departure . People here in Trail Stop , Idaho , tended to mind their own business , and if one of her guests was n't in the mood for company while he ate , that was fine with them . Cate herself noticed him only because she was bringing in a platter of sliced ham from the kitchen at the same time , and the kitchen door was directly opposite the open hall doorway . She made a mental note to go upstairs the first chance she got and see if he -- his name was Layton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some guests did n't like eating with strangers , plain and simple . Taking a tray up was n't anything unusual . Nightingale 's B and B had been open for almost two years . The Bed part of the business was often slow , but Breakfast was booming . Opening her dining room to the public for breakfast had been a happy accident . Instead of having one large dining table where everyone would sittogether -- assuming all five of her guest rooms were occupied at the same time , which had never happened -- she had placed five small tables , each seating four , in the dining room so that her guests could eat in relative privacy if they wanted . Folks in the little community had quickly realized that Nightingale 's offered some fine eating , and before she knew it , people were asking if it was okay if they stopped by for coffee in the mornings , and maybe for one of her blueberry muffins as well . As a newcomer she wanted to fit in , so because she had the extra seats , she said yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the added expense . Then , when they tried to pay her , she had no idea what to charge , because the cost of breakfast was included in the room rental ; so she 'd been forced to hand-print a menu with prices and post it on the side door , which most of the locals used instead of walking around to the front of the big old house . Within a month she 'd squeezed a sixth table into the dining room , bringing her total seating capacity to twenty-four . Sometimes even that was n't enough , especially if she had guests in residence . It was n't unusual to see men leaning against a wall while they drank their coffee and munched on muffins , if all the seats were taken . Today , however , was Scone Day . Once a week she baked scones instead of muffins . At first the community folk , mostly from ranch and lumberjack stock , had looked askance at the " fancy biscuits , " but the scones had quickly become a favorite . She had tried different flavors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went well with whatever jam the customer preferred . Cate set the platter of fried ham down in the middle of a table , exactly halfway between Conrad Moon and his son so that neither could accuse her of playing favorites . She had made that mistake once , putting a platter closer to Conrad , and since then the two had kept up a running commentary about whom she liked best . Gordon , the younger Moon , would be joking , but Cate had an uneasy feeling that Conrad was looking for a third wife and thought she 'd fill the position just fine . She thought otherwise , and made certain she never gave him any accidental encouragement with the ham placement . " Looks good , " Gordon drawled , as he did every day , stretching out his fork to capture a slice . " Better'n good , " Conrad added , unable to let Gordon top him in the compliment department . " Thank you , " she said as she hurried away , not giving Conrad a chance to add anything else . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's age , and she would n't have picked him even if she were n't too busy to even think about starting to date . As she passed by the Bunn double coffeemaker , she automatically checked the level of coffee in the pots , and paused to start a fresh batch . The dining room was still full , and people were lingering longer this morning . Joshua Creed , a rancher and hunting guide , was there with one of his clients ; folks always hung around when Mr. Creed was there , just to talk to him . He had an aura of leadership , of authority , that people naturally responded to . She 'd heard he was retired from the military , and she could believe it ; he radiated command , from his sharp , narrow gaze to the square set of his jaw and shoulders . He did n't come in very often , but when he did , he was usually the center of respectful attention . The client , a handsome dark-haired man she judged to be in his late thirties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least . He was obviously well off , if he could afford Joshua Creed , and though he was dressed in jeans and boots like most of the people in the room , he made certain , in some subtle and some not-so-subtle ways , that everyone knew he was Someone Important despite his show of camaraderie . For one thing , he 'd rolled up his shirtsleeves and kept flashing the thin , diamond-set watch on his left wrist . He was also just a shade too loud , a shade too hearty , and he kept mentioning his experiences on a game hunt in Africa . He even gave everyone a geography lesson , explaining where Nairobi was . Cate managed to refrain from rolling her eyes at his assumption that local was synonymous with ignorant . Weird , maybe , but not ignorant . He also made a point of explaining that he hunted wild animals mostly to photograph them , and though on an emotional level Cate approved of that , her common sense whispered that he was just saying it to give himself an out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any kind of photographer , she 'd be surprised . As she hurried on to the kitchen , she wondered just when she 'd started looking at newcomers as " outsiders . " The dividing line between her life before and her life now was so sharply defined that sometimes she felt as if she were n't even the same person . There had n't been a gradual change , giving her time to analyze and process , to slowly grow into the woman she was now ; instead there had been jagged breaks , abrupt upheavals . The period between Derek 's death and her decision to move to Idaho was a steep , narrow valley into which sunshine had never reached . Once she and the boys had arrived here , she 'd been so busy getting the B and B open and settling in that she had n't had much time to worry about being an outsider herself . Then , almost before she knew it , she was as much part of the warp and weave of the little community as she ever had been in Seattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big cities , filled with strangers and everyone moving in individual little bubbles . Here , she literally knew every soul -- all seventy-six of them . Just before she reached the kitchen door , it opened , and Sherry Bishop stuck her head out , a quick look of relief crossing her face when she saw Cate approaching . " What 's wrong ? " Cate asked as she rushed through the door . She looked first to the kitchen table , where her four-year-old twins , Tucker and Tanner , were industriously digging into their cereal , but the boys were sitting on their booster chairs exactly where she had left them . They chattered and giggled and squirmed , as usual ; all was right in their world . Rather , Tucker chattered , and Tanner listened . She could n't help worrying because Tanner talked so little , but their pediatrician had n't seemed alarmed . " He 's fine , " Dr. Hardy had said . " He does n't need to talk because Tucker is talking for both of them . He 'll talk when he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every other way , including comprehension , she had to assume the pediatrician was right -- but she still worried . She could n't help it ; she was a mother . " A pipe burst under the sink , " Sherry said , sounding harassed . " I turned off the valve , but we need the water back on fast . The dishes are piling up . " " Oh , no . " Other than the obvious difficulty of having no water to cook or wash dishes with , another problem loomed even larger : her mother , Sheila Wells , was en route from Seattle , for a weeklong visit , and was due in that afternoon . Since her mother was n't happy about Cate and the twins leaving Seattle to begin with , Cate could just imagine her comments about the area 's remoteness and lack of modern conveniences should there not be any water . It was always something ; this old house seemed to need almost constant maintenance and repair , which she supposed was par for the course with old houses . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could use just one week in which nothing went wrong . Maybe next week , she thought with a sigh . She picked up the kitchen phone and from memory dialed the number of Earl 's Hardware Store . Walter Earl himself answered , catching the phone on the first ring as he usually did . " Hardware . " He did n't need further identification , since there was only one hardware store in town , and he was the only one who answered the phone . " Walter , this is Cate . Do you know where Mr. Harris is working today ? I have a plumbing emergency . " " Mistuh Hawwis ! " Tucker crowed , having caught the name of the local handyman . Excited , he banged his spoon against the table , and Cate stuck her finger in her ear so she could hear what Walter said . Both boys were staring at her in delight , quivering with anticipation . The community handyman was one of their favorite people , because they were fascinated by his tools and he did n't mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harris did n't have a phone , but he customarily stopped by the hardware store every morning to pick up whatever supplies he would need for the day 's work ; so Walter usually knew where he could be found . When she had first moved here , Cate had been taken aback that someone would n't have a phone in this day and age , but now she was accustomed to the system and did n't think anything of it . Mr. Harris did n't want a phone , so he did n't have a phone . Big deal . The community was so small , finding him was n't a problem . " Cal 's right here , " Walter said . " I 'll send him your way . " " Thanks , " said Cate , glad she did n't have to hunt Mr. Harris down . " Could you ask him what time he thinks he can get here ? " Walter 's voice rumbled as he relayed the question , and she heard a softer , indistinct mumble that she recognized as Mr. Harris 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He said he 'll be there in a few minutes . " Saying good-bye and hanging up , Cate breathed a sigh of relief . With any luck the problem would be minor and the water would soon be on again , with minimal impact on her finances . As it was , she needed Mr. Harris 's fix-it genius so often she was beginning to think she would come out better to offer him free room and board in exchange for repairs . He lived in a room over the feed store , and while it might be bigger than any of her bedrooms , he still had to pay for it , plus she could throw in meals . She would lose a bedroom to rent , but it was n't as if the bed-and-breakfast had ever been filled to capacity . What held her back was the slightly unwelcome prospect of having someone permanently in the house with her and the twins . As busy as she was during the day , she wanted to keep the nights just for them . Mr. Harris was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something after supper and disappearing into his room , not to be seen again until the morning . But what if he did n't ? What if the boys wanted to be with him instead of her ? She felt small and petty for worrying about such a thing , but -- what if they did ? She was the center of their young lives , and she did n't know if she could give that up yet . Eventually she would have to , but they were just four , and all she had left of Derek . " Well ? " Sherry prompted , her brows raised as she waited for news , good or bad . " He 's coming right over . " " Caught him before he got started on another job , then , " said Sherry , looking as relieved as Cate felt . Cate looked at the boys , who were both sitting watching her , their spoons held suspended . " You two need to finish your cereal , or you wo n't be able to watch Mr. Harris , " she said sternly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harris would be right there in the kitchen with them , but they were four ; what did they know ? " We 'll huwwy , " Tucker said , and both resumed eating with more energy than precision . " Hurry , " Cate said , emphasizing the r sound . " Hurry , " Tucker obediently repeated . He could say the sound when he wanted to , but when he was distracted -- which was often -- he fell back into babyish speech patterns . He talked so much ; it was as if he did n't take the time to properly say the words . " Mistuh Hawwis is coming , " he told Tanner , as if his brother did n't know . " I 'm gon na play with the dwill . " " Drill , " Cate corrected . " And you will not . You may watch him , but leave the tools alone . " His big blue eyes filled with tears , and his lower lip trembled . " Mistuh Hawwis lets us play with them . " " That 's when he has time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has another job to do when he leaves here . "
