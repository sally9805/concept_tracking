<p> When they walked in the door of the Jefferson County Fairgrounds , they saw the weapons used to kill their children . <p> They saw the tables where the victims cowered and the seats where they died . <p> Families of the victims of the Columbine school shootings and some of the students who survived that day got their first look Wednesday at the evidence collected nearly five years ago . <p> For more than two hours , they milled , mostly silently , through two rooms filled with evidence , and a re-creation of the school library where 10 of the 12 students were killed as Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold went on their April 20 , 1999 , rampage . <p> A teacher , Dave Sanders , was also killed that day before Harris and Klebold killed themselves . <p> ' The hardest part for me was seeing the gun that shot Rachel , ' said Darrell Scott , whose daughter was among the first killed as she ate lunch on the grass just outside the school doors . ' Along the walls , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police bullets and Eric and Dylan 's . You see the physical sight of hundreds and hundreds of bullets and pipe bombs and fragments that exploded , and it 's pretty overwhelming . ' <p> Others agreed . <p> ' It was so emotional . A person ca n't go in there and see the horrible scenes - bullet holes in seats , bullet holes everywhere , ' said Betty Shoels , aunt of victim Isaiah Shoels , who was killed in the library . ' Just to see that , I broke down . ' <p> After briefings from state Attorney General Ken Salazar , Jefferson County Sheriff Ted Mink and others , and a chance to see - but not touch - the evidence , about 60 family members and former students streamed slowly to their cars . Most drove away without speaking to reporters , who remained 200 yards from the fairgrounds building . <p> The last to leave was Richard Castaldo , paralyzed from the chest down when he was shot approximately eight times while having lunch with Rachel Scott . <p> The public will be allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 10 a.m. today . <p> The mother of student Corey DePooter , who was killed at Columbine , pleaded for restraint . <p> ' All the information does n't need to be on television , ' Patricia DePooter said . ' These children , these young adults , need your compassion , your love . ' <p> Jefferson County sheriff 's spokeswoman Jacki Tallman said the families had ' a great number of questions ' for Salazar and Mink . She declined to describe those questions . <p> But former student Mark Taylor , who survived at least six bullet wounds that day , said he was surprised by how few questions were asked . Still , he said of the families ' reactions : ' It got pretty intense . ' <p> A counselor was on hand to talk with parents and former students . Many appeared to be crying as they left the building . <p> The gunmen , Harris , 18 , and Klebold , 17 , used numerous weapons , including assault rifles , in the massacre , and those were on display Wednesday , along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair wore as they tore through the school . Also among the items the Sheriff 's Office put on display Wednesday were videotapes the pair had made in school in the weeks and months that preceded the shootings . <p> Those tapes wo n't be released until this morning . <p> But Taylor , now 21 and living in Colorado Springs , saw them Wednesday and said they gave no hint of the massacre Harris and Klebold were planning . <p> ' It does n't seem like they 're that type of kids , ' Taylor said of the skits Harris and Klebold put on videotape , some involving pretend gunplay . ' They were role-playing , acting like kids . Just really stupid stuff . ' <p> But both Brian Rohrbough and his ex-wife , Sue Petrone , whose son Daniel was killed that day , said they thought the videos Harris and Klebold made should have been a clear sign to teachers and administrators at Columbine that trouble was coming . <p> ' I would have called the police , ' they said in unison when asked what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shooting . <p> The gathering was heavily guarded , in an effort to shield family from reporters , photographers and television crews . About a mile of yellow crime scene tape surrounded the auditorium and formed a perimeter nearly 200 yards out . <p> In addition to allowing the public the first look at the evidence , Salazar is expected to announce today results of a four-month investigation into how sheriff 's deputies failed to follow up on a tip about a violent website created by Harris . <p> The tip came Aug. 7 , 1997 , more than 20 months before the shootings . It preceded by seven months another tip that was long believed to be the first about the website . <p> Salazar has determined that Ron and Judy Brown filed the first tip anonymously . <p> The Browns , whose son Brooks was not injured in the shootings , had been singled out and threatened on the website . <p> The Browns made a second complaint about Harris and Klebold , in March 1998 . That prompted a search warrant to be issued for the Harris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salazar may explain why today . <p> Even as some questions remain unanswered , a few families said they appreciated the release of evidence , and that it moved them closer to finally reaching closure . <p> Tom Mauser , who lost his son Daniel to the killers , called the showing ' a big step forward ' and praised Mink 's office . <p> ' I realize some people will say , ' Why ca n't you get over this ? " Mauser said . ' I think we could have . If we had just done this two or three years ago . ' <p> For those who saw the evidence Wednesday , individual pieces held special meaning . <p> For Angela Adkins , daughter of slain teacher Dave Sanders , one of the smallest items - a personal packet of Advil - on display Tuesday afternoon made her pause and think of her father . <p> ' My dad always kept a packet in his shirt pocket , ' Adkins said . ' It makes me feel better to think that is where it came from . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some type of closure , especially after an official she declined to identify acknowledged that her father could have been saved that day . <p> ' I 'm sure he should have been taken out of the school , ' Adkins said of her father , who bled to death in a science room while awaiting help for more than four hours . ' That 's what I was trying to say for five years . Now someone else has said it . ' <p> A photo of Adkins ' father stood out for parent Darrell Scott . <p> ' One thing that stopped my heart was a picture , taken from a videotape , where Dave Sanders was starting up the stairs , ' Scott said . ' That brings tears to my eyes , because you know he 's headed for his death , and he 's doing it willingly . He 's a hero to me . Everybody else is running out , and he 's running up toward the shooting . That 's a powerful image .
