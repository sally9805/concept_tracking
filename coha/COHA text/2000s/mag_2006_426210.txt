// Just because we call God " Father " and " Lord " does n't mean we ca n't name God in other ways , too . A RECENT CONVERSATION WITH MY 15-YEAR-OLD daughter went something like this : " When you think of God , do you think of God as male or female ? " I ask . " I do n't think of God as male or female . " " How do you think of God ? " " As a being , a person , but not as male or female . " " Well , when you pray , how do you pray ? " " I just talk to him . " " Him ? " " Oh-that 's weird , " she says , laughing at the inherent contradiction . " Well , " she emphatically states , " I do n't think of God as a man . " A day later I join friends for breakfast . Married women and mothers , we are all active in ministry or catechesis . " When I 'm looking for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he or him for God , I put the card back , " one comments . The others acknowledge they do likewise , and not only for Baptism cards . " We could n't refer to God as he when writing papers , " notes another , a recent graduate of a major Catholic school of theology . During the same week I speak with a 60-year-old religious sister , a respected spiritual director and retreat leader , who says , " I have n't used the word Lord or Father in my prayer in years . " She goes on , " Try addressing God as " you . " It 's not a new idea . " She then directs me to a prayer from the fourth century attributed to St. Gregory of Nazianzus : O you , the One beyond all things , how could we call you by any other name ? What song can be sung for you ? No word can express you . What spirit can perceive you ? No intelligence can comprehend you . You alone are inexpressible .... Inexpressible , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom we pray , the one with whom we are in relationship . Each of the women I 've mentioned is seeking words that are faithful to her understanding and experience of the divine . Their experience is new wine for which the old wineskins are inadequate . WHY DOES IT MATTER WHAT WORDS WE USE TO NAME God ? Because words have power to shape us and change us . Think of how we feel when someone we love speaks words of endearment or forgiveness . Consider the way language is used during wartime to demonize the enemy , making it possible to use violence that would otherwise be unthinkable . Likewise , the language we use in prayer , whether our personal , private prayer or our public , communal prayer , is potent-why else would we pray ? So it is fair to ask what happens to us when we consistently use the pronouns he and his for God . The first chapter of Genesis tells us that humankind , male and female , is created in God 's image . What images of God mirror this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we created in the image and likeness of God ? A number of years ago controversial feminist theologian Mary DaIy shocked many into awareness with her statement , " If God is male , then the male is God . " While that may seem extreme to many , it 's worth pondering . Why , for instance , is the Vatican so insistent that God always be " he " and that humankind be " men " or " mankind " in the English liturgy ? Such decisions remind me of Stephen Dedalus in James Joyce 's Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man , Stephen is very sure that " God was God 's name .... " And while the French may say Dieu and God would understand that a French person was praying , " God 's real name was God . " We know that God is neither male nor female , that our words for God function as metaphors , symbols , and images that help us approach the mystery of God , who is ultimately ineffable , beyond all names . But is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him " - or to anything else ? The key word here is limit . Drawing on Thomas Aquinas ' recognition of the need to give God many names , theologian Elizabeth Johnson , C.S.J. writes : " The tradition of many names for God results from the genuine experience of divine mystery and acts as a safeguard for it . " Do n't we know this instinctively ? As a catechist for 3- to 9-year-olds , I observe that a favorite hymn of children of all ages is " Jesus , Name Above All Names . " It goes : " Jesus , name above all names , Beautiful Savior , glorious Lord ! Emmanuel , God is with us ! Blessed Redeemer , Living Word ! " - all traditional names that , when sung in sequence , draw us into the mystery of Jesus more adequately than any one term alone . Jesus , rabbi and good teacher that he was , knew to employ different images when asked , " Who are you ? " Jesus stunned people by claiming his identity as the Son of God ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but historically resonant term Son of Man to himself . Yet neither was sufficient to disclose the fullness of revelation , nor do the terms draw his disciples , then or now , into the heart of Jesus ' message . For that Jesus drew on more familiar , particular , and vivid images to spark the imagination and enflame the heart : I am the good shepherd ; the gate ; the vine ; the light of the world ; the bread of life ; the way , the truth , and the life ; I am . As a catechist I meditate with children on the images Jesus uses in his parables to speak of the reign of God . Together we ask : What is the source of the mustard seed 's growth or the leavens power ? What is it that drives a woman to search for a lost coin ? Or a man to sell all he has to buy a field ? Such images lead us to wonder , to want to know and to experience more of this reign of God . These images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters what word images we use to name God . I am not suggesting that we eliminate traditional words such as Father , King , or Lord from our prayer lexicon . And I agree that when we use those words , the pronoun he is correct . But let 's not stop there , or we risk idolatry by holding up an image of God that is false because it is incomplete . ANSELM OF CANTERBURY , A DOCTOR OF the church , and Julian of Norwich , a 14th-century mystic , had no trouble speaking of Christ as our Mother . Certainly the experience of God 's mothering is not limited to the mystics . More recently Pope John Paul I said , " God is our father ; even more , God is our mother . " If God is our mother , if God the Holy Spirit is Sophia , Lady Wisdom , can we not also call God she ? The Latin root of mother , mater , suggests the English word matter . If we spent more time praying to God our Mother , might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of creation , our earth ? Might we be more reverent and respectful of the created world , of air , seas , and skies , because we sense their sacred origin ? As I write this , rain is beginning to fall on the drought-stricken part of the Midwest where I live . The grass shows signs of returning to life ; the parched flowers lift to drink the drops of water and a moist sweetness infiltrates the air . I begin to wonder if new ways of speaking about God might also bring forth new life to our suffering world . If we had a sense of God as our holy Mother , might we do a better job of feeding the hungry ? Of caring for the widow and the orphan ? Of beating our swords into plowshares ? Of respecting this unique planet we call our home and our Mother Earth ? Should we not try ?
