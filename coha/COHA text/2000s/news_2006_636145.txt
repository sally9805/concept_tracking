<p> FOR SOME CAMPFIRE MOMENTS , YOU JUST HAVE TO BE THERE <p> PINCKNEYVILLE , Ill.  --  We turned off the main road south of town , winding west through fields and wood lots . To where , we had no idea , but my stepson Josh Clothier and I were pretty sure we would know when we got there . <p> In other words , a perfect start to a camping trip . <p> A visit earlier this month to the World Shooting and Recreational Complex offered an excuse to camp at Pyramid State Recreational Area , reclaimed mines that form the 19,701 acres of the state 's largest site . <p> On a whim , I asked the 14-year-old if he wanted to go along . Instead of the slouched shoulders and ahhhnnn " of typical teenage angst , he gave an OK . " <p> And it was . <p> Mint-chocolate and **27;2403;TOOLONG shakes set the tone at the Steak n Shake in Effingham . South of there , Interstate 57 enters another time when farms were small , streams wild and fencerows growing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A couple hours south , we stumbled upon the northern entrance to Pyramid and began looking for a camping site with the ageless basics of fire ring , picnic table and gravel slot for the car . <p> Several dozen sites were scattered along two lakes . From a family that looked like veterans , we asked advice . They said Boulder Lake on the southern end is usually more packed . <p> But Josh and I had time . Pyramid is so big that it took nearly half an hour to reach Boulder Lake campground on the gravel roads . <p> Driving the gravel at dusk had its own rewards . Along one stretch , we rode an old gravel bank , leftover from mining I assume , with fields on one side and woods on the hour . Deer streamed toward the field in the dimming light . We drew close enough to two deer to almost touch them . <p> That 's the closest I 've ever been to deer , " Josh said . <p> We had the entire campground to ourselves and took a site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the isolation of the Mazonia area , only expanded by 10 . Josh started the fire . I arranged camp , opting to sleep under the stars . <p> While he played with fire , I hopped a frog lure through a scummed-over bay . But only small largemouth bass nipped at it . A great blue heron flapped in chase of the frog , saw me and braked into a squawking U-turn . <p> As night closed in , we finally ate . Josh downed three hot dogs , half a bag of Mesquite bar-b-que chips and most of the can of Bush 's beans . <p> Bullfrogs and a smaller frog , which made an ear-piercing sound like marbles being ground in a big man 's fist , crescendoed . A nighthawk coasted by . Even held at bay by DEET , mosquitoes drilled the night with buzzing . In the distance , coyotes yapped . Later , in our sleeping bags , we heard owls hooting . <p> We went on a night hike to do some late casting with the frog . Hey , there 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the woods to the water 's edge . We tried to pick out the fainter stars of the Little Dipper . <p> Back at camp , despite the fire he built , raccoons brazenly raided the nearby trash can , then walked over the foot of his sleeping bag , much to my amusement as sleep came . <p> After breakfast , Josh said , Let 's roast marshmallows . " My parental instinct was to say no . But why not , it was time , away . <p> He burns his marshmallows while I prefer the more gentle browning . After shaking off a flaming marshmallow , he looked at the shards and laughed , Dude , this is awesome . It is like the crystals from Superman Returns . " ' <p> For some moments , you have to be there ; or you never have them . <p> Pyramid is 5oe hours south of Chicago . Take I-57 south , I-64 west , Route 127 south , then , outside of Pinckneyville , go right at the sign . <p> Bowman 's Outdoor Line " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p.m .

The captain was terrific with him , treating him equal to all , yet giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him 10 percent , which in retrospect may not have been enough . If there is a guideline please let me know . " Name withheld <p> A : This discussion comes up every year . Here 's what I 've gathered from fishermen and captains both . Ten percent is a good starting point , and do n't forget to include the first mate . Make it higher if you caught the fish of a lifetime , had a great time , impressed the hell out of a client or had somebody in your party who was a pain in the ass to the captain or mate . <p> NUMBERS GAME <p> The Winter Severity Indices , compiled using snow depth and minimum temperature to calculate last winter 's effect on deer survival and reproduction , according to the Wisconsin DNR .
