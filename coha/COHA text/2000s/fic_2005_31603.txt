Chapter One A Futile Request Alexa waited at the school entryway , anxiously scanning the line of cars jostling for position at the curb . It was five after 3:00 on Friday and the school week was mercifully over . Today Alexa 's father was scheduled to pick her up along with Doug and Caroline , the two other kids in her carpool . Alexa was fervently hoping that her dad would n't be late . It was so awkward to wait when Doug and Caroline were impatient to leave . " Is your mom coming ? " Doug asked pointedly . Alexa shifted uncomfortably and adjusted the wayward straps of her backpack . Doug was the star of both the junior varsity soccer team and the lacrosse team . In the social hierarchy of Ithaca High School , Doug reigned with a status and popularity unmatched by his classmates . Alexa was far too shy to pursue a friendship with a boy like Doug , but the proximity of their houses made it natural for them to carpool together . Caroline was the third member of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more natural counterpart for Doug . " My dad 's coming today , " Alexa answered , as she stood on her tiptoes to catch a glimpse of the end of the line . " There he is ! " Alexa could n't hide the relief in her voice as she spotted her father 's red Chevy Suburban . Alexa slid into the front seat next to her father while Doug and Caroline hopped into the back . They must have beensharing a private joke-Caroline was giggling incessantly . Alexa silently speculated that the two would probably begin dating this summer and would end up being homecoming king and queen . The two of them just seemed to emulate the conventional image of popularity-contest winners , she thought with disdain . Alexa greeted her father with a quick kiss on the cheek . She was genuinely happy to see him because she had n't seen him since last weekend . Her parents had separated recently , and the process of finalizing the divorce was currently underway . It was still a fresh and painful wound for Alexa , exacerbated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father 's apartment . After dropping off Doug , they continued on in silence to the exclusive cul-de-sac where Caroline lived in a large , pretentious Tudor-style mansion . Caroline left with a quick " thanks " and Alexa breathed a sigh of relief . Caroline 's haughty attitude and disdainful glances were tiring . It was n't that she felt jealous of Doug and Caroline , nor did she feel particularly miffed that the two of them often did n't include her in their conversations . It just seemed that they perpetuated an aura of superiority that Alexa did n't aspire to . Alexa pulled the visor down and flipped open the mirror , studying her reflection . She pulled the rubber band out of her ponytail and her shiny , shoulder-length brown hair came tumbling down , covering her green eyes . Growing up , Alexa had always been a bit of a tomboy-she was not inclined to obsess about her looks the way so many of her contemporaries did . Her attitude had begun to change only recently , when she realized that it was not incongruous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This past year , Alexa 's first year of high school , was really the first time that she started feeling good about the way she looked . She had started running on the track team and it was as if she had undergone a transformation from an awkward , shy tomboy to an attractive and confident 16-year-old . Alexa took her hairbrush out of her backpack and fixed her ponytail as they drove past Alexa 's house high on the hill overlooking Cayuga Lake . " It looks like the lawn could use a little work , " Alexa 's father noted as he glanced at the house the three of them had shared up until two months ago , when he took a modest apartment in downtown Ithaca . Alexa maintained her silence as she wondered what her father was thinking . His demeanor did n't reveal anything , but Alexa wondered if he could really feel that detached from the house they had all shared for so many years . Alexa 's father , David McCurry , was a venerated professor of molecular biology at Cornell University . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with aspiring pre-med students . " The Inner Machinations of the Cell " was the title of his popular graduatelevel seminar , attended by scores of serious-minded scientists in the making . He was highly regarded by his colleagues in the research community for being at the forefront of emergent technologies in the rapidly evolving field of genetics . Alexa was proud of her father and treasured the time they spent together during her childhood , as brief as these interludes were . Alexa 's father was also busy running a molecular biology laboratory , where he and his graduate students studied DNA in endless detail . He studied the DNA of a worm called a nematode , which was so tiny you needed a microscope to see it . Alexa would often go to the laboratory with her father on weekends , where he would inevitably become embroiled in deep and lengthy discussions with the graduate students who , it seemed to her , appeared to live in the laboratory . It was Alexa 's mom , Helen , who was always there for her with abundant time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's life . Helen was also a scientist , but as she liked to characterize it when the subject of vocation came up , she was an " unemployed marine biologist , landlocked in the middle of upstate New York . " Helen had forgone a scientific career , citing the fact that it was next to impossible to have a career in marine biology so far from the ocean . Meanwhile , Alexa 's father had a burgeoning scientific career and he had successfully climbed the academic ladder . Alexa had begun to suspect that the chasm between her parents had something to do with the conflicting requirements of their careers . Alexa 's mother wanted to move to an academic setting near the ocean , while her father was reluctant to move away from the successful laboratory he had created at Cornell . Alexa and her dad arrived at the small apartment that he now called home . She followed him inside and settled in at the desk in front of a giant-screen computer . Her father was clearly inept at decorating , Alexa thought as she looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or maybe he was just indifferent to the aesthetics of his surroundings . Alexa reconsidered and thought that was probably it . To Alexa , her father seemed adept at everything he put his mind to . But he abhorred spending time thinking about such mundane things as decorating . Her father was an archetypal professor-his mind was always on his studies . " Do you want a soda ? " her father asked . " Sure , " Alexa replied , sensing her father was making an effort to make her happy in this awkward new routine . " What do you say we go to Zeus ' for pizza tonight ? " her father asked as he set the can of soda down next to the mouse pad . " OK , but I 'm supposed to go to Laurie 's tonight to watch a movie with my friends , " Alexa said as she typed in her e-mail password . " No problem , I 'll drop you off there after dinner . " " Can I stay there until 11:30 ? " Alexa asked in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had gotten her driver 's permit when she turned sixteen last month , but she was still unable to drive unaccompanied by an adult . Her father made an exaggerated pained expression . He liked to be in bed by 11:00 , but Alexa could plainly see by his smile that he would let her . Alexa saw a message from Laurie in her inbox . This past year they had become best friends , and this had changed Alexa 's life immeasurably for the better . All throughout junior high , Alexa had felt like she did n't have a close group of friends . It was n't like she was totally bereft of friends , but she had n't formed any friendships that felt particularly meaningful and enduring . This past year , everything had changed when Alexa entered Ithaca High School and met Laurie . Laurie was editor of the school newspaper . She was bright , funny , and gregarious . Alexa had joined the school newspaper this past year and her easy camaraderie with Laurie had grown into a deep friendship . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Laurie , in turn , was a solid friend . She always included Alexa in her close circle of friends , a group of girls Alexa really liked . It was as if Laurie 's endorsement opened up a whole new existence for Alexa . It felt so good to finally find a group of friends she liked and trusted-friends she cherished and wanted to keep forever . Alexa opened the message from Laurie , which read : " Hi Lexxie ! Are you home yet ? ? Call me ASAP ! You 're not going to believe my unbelievable luck ! I got an internship with CNN this summer ! Ca n't wait to tell you all about it . I 'm going to be the assistant to the reporter who works right in downtown Ithaca . I 'm soooo excited ! ! Are you coming over tonight ? Call me ! : - ) Laurie Alexa smiled at the thought of Laurie 's elation . Laurie was such a go-getter . She had an easygoing demeanor , yet she approached challenges with enthusiasm and ardor . Even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude . After receiving a stack of rejection letters , she had scored the internship of her dreams . Her persistence had paid off spectacularly . While Alexa was happy for Laurie and her great summer job , she had been brooding about her own uncertain plans for the summer . She desperately wanted to stay in Ithaca and spend her vacation with Laurie . However , Alexa was cognizant of her mother 's plans to spend the summer in Nicaragua , and Alexa had the perception that she was expected to go with her . But since the final decision had not yet been made , Alexa hoped that she could cajole her father into letting her stay in Ithaca with him . * * * Zeus ' pizza house was the best of several excellent pizza places in the college town of Ithaca . It was always busy , and this being Friday night , was even more chaotic than usual . The clientele was largely made up of students , one of whom waved a greeting to Professor McCurry as he and Alexa entered the restaurant . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a minor celebrity in town , and Alexa beamed with pride . Her father waited until the pizza arrived at the table , piping hot , thick , and cheesy , to bring up the topic she 'd been dreading . Without preamble , he delved into the dreaded subject . " You know about the new job offer your mother got for this summer . " Alexa took a bite of pizza as her father spoke gingerly . Helen had been offered a consulting position at a marine biology facility called Puerto Marino , which was located on a Caribbean island off of the coast of Nicaragua in Central America . " This would be a really great opportunity for you , " her father continued . " You could work on your Spanish , see a new place , get to ... " " I do n't want to go to Nicaragua for the summer ! " Alexa cut him off . " I want to stay here in Ithaca ! Ca n't I stay here with you ? " Alexa pleaded volubly . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming in the gorge every day , and Laurie 's brother has a boat on the lake , and I applied for a job at Hansen 's Department Store ! " The words were tumbling out of Alexa 's mouth , but she could already sense it was a losing battle . " A department store ? " Alexa 's father repeated in a disparaging tone of voice . " Why would you want to sell clothes all summer when you could work in a lab ? They have a fully equipped molecular biology lab at Puerto Marino and your mother has already arranged for you to work there . It would be a great opportunity for you to have a project of your own , not to mention the fact that it may very well help you get into a good school . Colleges invariably look for this type of thing-an interesting and educational summer experience . " " I do n't think that spending a whole summer locked up in a laboratory sounds very interesting ! " Alexa exclaimed . She was in no mood for her dad 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to go to college . It was that her parents unending discourse about " what you should be doing if you want to go to a good college " was truly tiring and left Alexa feeling ambivalent about the whole subject . Alexa 's father raised his eyebrows in a tacit response . Her flippancy had clearly struck a sour note with him . Alexa looked down at her pizza , seeing it was futile to argue . Her father was resolute . She was going to Nicaragua for the summer . ( Continues ... )
