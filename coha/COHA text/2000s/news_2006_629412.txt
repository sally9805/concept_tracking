<p> DISMISSED by some scientists as a mere chunk of icy rock after its celebrated discovery as the solar system 's ninth planet , distant Pluto is staging a cosmic comeback . <p> The resurgence in interest is focused on whether the celestial object smaller than Earth 's moon should be classified as a true planet , a double planet orbiting the sun with what was previously identified as its own moon ; or one of the solar system 's most primitive building blocks . <p> In an attempt to unravel the mystery , NASA 's camera-laden New Horizons spacecraft is scheduled to thunder off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida this week on a $700 million , decade-long journey to Pluto and its moonlike companion Charon . <p> " Thoughts of Pluto raise images of something very dark , far away and cold . But actually Pluto is a treasure-trove of scientific discovery just waiting to be uncovered , " said Andrew Dantzler , director of NASA 's solar system division . " A successful mission helps us meet one of our key objectives - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Pluto , a body discovered nearly 76 years ago , is the only major object in the solar system that has not been the focus of close-up scrutiny by a spacecraft . <p> New Horizons ' liftoff is planned for Tuesday , the first day of a launch period that extends through Feb. 14 . At 4 billion miles away , Pluto is so distant that the spacecraft requires a send-off atop an Atlas V , one of the nation 's most powerful rockets . <p> The spacecraft relies on the use of radioactive plutonium as an electrical power source , a design feature that has drawn protests from anti-nuclear groups . <p> American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh is credited with discovering Pluto on Feb. 18 , 1930 . By painstakingly sifting through images of star fields in search of faint objects exhibiting only subtle shifts in position , Tombaugh 's finding seemed to settle years of intense speculation about a ninth planet in the solar system . <p> As the years passed , though , most astronomers seemed to lose interest in Pluto because of the difficulties in studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth 's moon and so far away , Pluto is 10,000 times fainter in the night sky than the human eye can see . Even the eagle-eyed Hubble Space Telescope , which was launched in 1990 , can make out little more than a spherical blob when pointed at Pluto . <p> With so little to observe , scientists focused their attention instead on the rocky , inner planets - Mercury , Venus and Mars - as well as the glowing , outer gas giants - Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune . <p> Circling the sun along the solar system 's far frontier , Pluto did n't seem to resemble any of its planetary siblings , leading some scientists to conclude that it was n't a planet at all . <p> The blurred tones of light and dark visible to Hubble suggest that Pluto is a conglomeration of ice and rock with a tenuous atmosphere . <p> A Kuiper Belt Object ? <p> Now , a new generation of astronomers suspects that Tombaugh discovered something quite special - the largest in a class of celestial bodies known as Kuiper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice- and rock-fused objects , many of them comets , travel around the sun well beyond Neptune . Scientists think they are remnants from the formation of the sun and planets 4.6 billion years ago . <p> Gerard Kuiper , a Dutch-American astronomer , built on the speculation of colleagues to propose the notion of Kuiper Belt Objects in 1951 . <p> Astronomers claimed the first discovery of such objects , an orb 10 times smaller than Pluto , in 1992 . Since then , the number has grown to more than 1,000 , setting off a debate about whether Pluto is a Kuiper Belt Object or a planet . <p> Using Hubble and other powerful modern observatories , astronomers have observed disk-like formations of similar objects around nearby stars . <p> If there is a link between the Kuiper Belt and disks encircling other stars , Pluto could hold important clues about the earliest stages of planet formation , according to Alan Stern , a planetary geologist at the Southwest Research Institute of Boulder , Colo. , who serves as New Horizons ' chief scientist . <p> " In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey , but also a journey 4 billion years back in time , " Stern said . <p> Recent discoveries have only deepened the Pluto mystery . Some experts wonder whether major Kuiper Belt Objects should be considered planets . <p> At 1,466 miles in diameter , Pluto is made up of primordial materials with enough density and gravity to give it the classic spherical shape associated with planets rather than the jagged outline of an asteroid or comet . In 1978 , astronomers discovered an object half the size of Pluto that they said was a moon . <p> Some scientists think the moon Charon is another sign that Pluto deserves planetary status . However , other experts think that because the two objects are so close in size , Pluto and Charon should be considered a " double planet . " <p> Last year , two much smaller objects were discovered circling Pluto . <p> Earth-based observations have revealed a thin atmospheric haze on Pluto with the chemical precursors for biological activity . The origin of this haze is a frozen landscape where temperatures sink to minus 400 degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horizontal , rather than vertical , orientation of its poles appear at times to trigger a large enough drop in temperatures to cause gases in the atmosphere to freeze and fall to the surface like snow . <p> Launch date ramifications <p> If New Horizons can lift off by Feb. 2 , the spacecraft will sail toward Jupiter with its cargo of seven scientific instruments , three of them cameras . The probe will swing close enough to Jupiter to get a gravitational boost that will set up its arrival at Pluto between mid-2015 and mid-2017 . <p> If liftoff occurs between Feb. 3 and Feb. 14 , New Horizons would have to travel without Jupiter 's help and would not reach Pluto until 2018 at the earliest and 2020 at the latest . <p> The spacecraft 's instruments are to begin their scrutiny of Pluto months before New Horizons makes its closest approach . Soaring past Pluto and Charon at more than 30,000 mph , the spacecraft will record surface features such as craters and other undulations as small as 80 feet in size . <p> Readings transmitted back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composition and weather patterns , factors that will influence debate on whether Pluto is a planet or a Kuiper Belt Object . <p> If the spacecraft performs well , NASA will seek a five-year mission extension . After it zips past Pluto and Charon , scientists hope to steer it toward more distant Kuiper Belt Objects for scrutiny . <p> PLUTO AND ITS MOONS <p> Discovered in 1930 , Pluto has three known moons - Charon , discovered in 1978 , and at least two smaller satellites , discovered last year . <p> Diameters compared : <p> Pluto 1,466 mi . <p> Charon 749 mi . <p> S/2005 99 mi . <p> S/2005 80 mi . <p> Pluto flyby : 2015 <p> Traveling at more than 30,000 mph , the probe will pass through Pluto 's system in only 24 hours . <p> Extended mission : 2016-2020 <p> NASA is hoping for encounters with objects in the Kuiper Belt before the craft disappears into interstellar space . <p> The Kuiper Belt <p> A ring of millions of icy and rocky objects orbiting the sun beyond the orbits of Neptune and Pluto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 2006 <p> From Cape Canaveral , Fla . <p> Jupiter flyby : 2007 <p> If launched in first three weeks of launch window , slingshot-like gravity boost could shave years off flight time . <p> Powered by plutonium <p> Probe powered by plutonium-generated heat converted into electricity . <p> Solar Wind at Pluto ( SWAP ) <p> Will measure Pluto 's interaction with the solar wind - the stream of charged particles flowing from the sun - to provide insight about Pluto 's atmosphere . <p> Long Range Reconnaissance Imager ( LORRI ) <p> Essentially a digital camera with a large photo telescope , will provide high-resolution images of the surfaces of Pluto , Charon and other Kuiper Belt Objects . <p> Student Dust Counter ( SDC ) <p> First science instrument on a NASA planetary mission designed by students , will measure dust particles in the outer solar system . <p> Optical guidance <p> ( star trackers ) <p> Heat shield <p> Thruster <p> High-gain antenna <p> Used to exchange information with Earth . At Pluto , craft will be 3 billion miles away . Four-hour transmission time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months to transmit . <p> Thermal blanket <p> To retain heat , the craft is covered in gold-colored thermal insulation blankets . <p> ABOUT THE SIZE OF A PIANO <p> The probe weighs 1,054 pounds .
