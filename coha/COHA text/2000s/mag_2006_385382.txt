. Catalytic converters , cruise control and joysticks are now available on an inboard near you . IT SEEMS THAT OUTBOARD MOTORS GET THE LION 'S SHARE OF attention when it comes to reporting on what 's new in marine propulsion . Deservedly so in most cases , because advances in fuel injection and the perennial horsepower race are headline grabbers that technophiles ca n't resist  --  and , of course , there are far more outboards out there than inboards . Yet inboard engine builders have not lagged behind when it comes to technological breakthroughs that deliver more horsepower and do so in a more environmentally friendly manner . These companies have been burning the midnight oil to further the evolution of their products , and the results are evident in some of the new engines that have recently hit the market and in many that are about to ( we 'll be reporting on those in the months ahead ) . There 's a definite parallel between what 's driving advances in inboard and outboard propulsion systems . Just as the quest for lower exhaust emissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impressive crop of smooth , clean , powerful engines that outboard owners now have to choose from , so have EPA regulations prompted similar improvements in inboards . For the most part , progress in both market segments has been based on the melding of chemistry and electrical engineering , two disciplines that have spurred most of the innovations in marine engine technology . Here 's a perfect example of how one inboard engine builder has met the challenge of governmental restrictions on exhaust emissions by incorporating more sophisticated electronics into the mix : Indmar Marine 's ( www.indmar.com ) catalytic converter . Developed for gas V-8s , Indmar 's spanking new ETX/CAT is a first for marine inboards and literally slashes exhaust emissions in half , thereby meeting  --  and even exceeding  --  the stringent 2007 California Air Resources Board ( CARB ) requirements . ETX/CAT works its magic in a fairly simple way . Hot exhaust gas flows out of the cylinders and into a canister mounted in the exhaust manifold . Inside the canister is a brick comprised of a proprietary mixture of precious metals . Exhaust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature gas and precious metals eliminates pollution . That 's the chemistry , but there 's more to the story : namely , the electronics . A vital component of the ETX/CAT system is MEFI-5 , GM 's latest and greatest electronic control module . This mini-computer modulates ignition timing , ignition spark and the fuel-to-air ratio . The ability to precisely adjust these crucial variables makes it possible for Indmar 's ETX/CAT to scrub exhaust gas clean and at the same time for the pistons and crankshaft to build horsepower in a torque curve that 's as flat as a desert . Simple math states that the flatter the torque curve , the stronger the acceleration . Outboard builders have also pursued the catalytic converter route . Back in the early ' 90s Yamaha Marine researched and developed a catalytic converter intended for its line of four-stroke outboard motors . Gathering dust on a shelf somewhere in Japan , the technology still lies waiting in the wings . Another prime example of how electronic firmware is shaping inboard capabilities is Crusader 's ( www.crusader.com ) new dualengine synchronization , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the touch of a button twin Crusader gas engines automatically synchronize their rpm . Once they are in near-perfect sync , the skipper adjusts rpm by advancing a single throttle lever . The result is less fuel burn . Plus , the boat maintains a truer course . Also new is Crusader 's cruise control . That 's right  --  cruise control for boats . Specifically , it locks in a boat 's cruising speed in miles per hour , offering the ability to bump up speed in increments of 25 rpm . Another nifty feature is its memory mode , valuable for the way it recalls a preferred cruising speed . For example , immediately after clearing a no-wake zone , the memory function increases engine rpm until the boat is once more traveling at its preferred cruising speed . While automotive cruise controls throttle up or down whenever vehicles are ascending or descending steep hills , Crusader 's cruise control reacts to varying sea conditions . Once a speed setting is locked in , the Crusader control automatically revs up or slows the motor down , as required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( PCM ) engines , which are part of the Crusader family of engines . But PCM motors are not as full-featured as the engines from Crusader  --  engine synchronization is not available . Taking a page from Indmar , Crusader , noted for building premium products , is busily researching and developing its own proprietary catalytic converter . Stay tuned . BOX JOYSTICK SYSTEMS VOLVO PENTA IPS VS CUMMINS MERCRUISER ZEUS The biggest newsmakers in inboard power are still IPS and Zeus  --  new diesel inboard-powered steerable pod drives from Volvo Penta ( www.volvo-penta.com ) and Cummins MerCruiser Diesel ( www.CMDmarine.com ) , respectively . Volvo 's IPS ( below ) replaces conventional inboard shafts and struts with a bronze drive leg protruding through the bottom of the hull and fitted with twin counter-rotating propellers that face forward . Fly-by-wire steering swings the drive leg . For 2006 , IPS has been upgraded to include joystick control at slow speed . By simply twisting a knob , a helmsman can pirouette an IPS boat on its own axis . The IPS 400 features a Volvo D-6 rated at 310 hp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 370 hp . Both are intercooled and turbocharged , and the more powerful 500 benefits from a supercharger . The IPS 400 system is a direct replacement for conventional twin 400-hp inboard diesels , with the IPS 500 aimed squarely at 500-hp inboards . CMC 's Zeus ( above ) has twin counter-rotating propellers that face aft , and the pods are mounted in tunnels , positioning them at about the same depth as the keel . The Zeus drive is substantially more efficient than a conventional inboard shaft-and-strut arrangement . Zeus-rigged boats go 7 percent faster with 30 percent better fuel economy , and maneuvering is improved . At low speeds a Zeus steers with a joystick that controls each pod 's propeller thrust in order to crab sideways . Docking is a joy . So is standing still , thanks to CMD 's " intelligence station keeping system " that puts Zeus in touch with a GPS . It keeps a boat precisely on station . Strong currents and wind are compensated for . Zeus pods are powered by the CMD Quantum series of engines , either a QSB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state-of-the-art .
