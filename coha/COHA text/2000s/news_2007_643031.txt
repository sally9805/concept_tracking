<p> GHANSHYAM P. SHAH , an 82-year-old widower , spends up to eight hours a day in front of his television watching prayer services , soap operas and financial news . But one afternoon last December , he was completely disconnected from his favorite pastime  --  and visibly unsettled  --  because his new digital set-top box was not working . <p> " I 'll become really agitated if I ca n't watch , " Mr. Shah said as Rumy M. Bhagat , the owner of a small cable company , gave up and plugged the wire directly into the television until he could return with another box . The image was no longer digital , but that did not matter to Mr. Shah , a retired gold and silver dealer , whose face lit up as CNBC India reported that the price of gold was up in afternoon trading . <p> Mr. Bhagat explained that some set-top boxes , which had been sitting in warehouses for months in advance of a government-mandated change to digital television , had proved a weak match for the heat and humidity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . <p> Growing pains like these are common throughout India 's booming television industry . Deregulation and new technology have combined to produce an explosion of new offerings . Before the early 1990s , a single government broadcaster provided a handful of channels . Now a crowded field of domestic and global media companies , including the News Corporation , Sony Entertainment and Walt Disney , offer hundreds of channels . <p> Indian films , especially the flashy musicals and dramas of Bollywood , have grabbed plenty of attention in the West . But the country 's lesser-known television business is more than twice as big , with an estimated $3.4 billion in revenue in 2005 , according to PricewaterhouseCoopers . It is also starting to exert greater cultural influence . <p> Television ownership is growing fast here , and it has plenty more room to expand . There are roughly 105 million homes with televisions in India , up from 88 million in 2000 . The current number of television households is about the same as in the United States , though for India that amounts to only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 98 percent in the United States . <p> Advertising spending on Indian television increased by 21 percent a year , on average , from 1995 to 2005 , when it reached $1.6 billion , according to ZenithOptimedia , which tracks advertising globally . Double-digit growth rates are expected to continue for years . <p> Such numbers are very tempting to companies like the News Corporation , Disney , Time Warner and Viacom , which are losing viewers and advertisers in their core Western markets . ( In addition to the domestic market , Indian television is also delivered via satellite and cable to the global South Asian diaspora . ) <p> The pace of change in India is supercharged because the country is catching up to , and in some cases leapfrogging , developments that took decades to play out elsewhere . <p> " Everything that happened in the rest of the world in 10 years , is happening here in two years , " said Vikram Kaushik , the chief executive of Tata Sky , a satellite-TV company that is jointly owned by the News Corporation and the Tata Group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , media companies seized on new opportunities in India after the government , which had controlled broadcasting for nearly 50 years , began releasing its grip . The first big changes in Indian television came in the early part of that decade , when cable operators used satellite dishes , illegal but tolerated at the time , to give subscribers access to news on CNN , as well as American soap operas and movies . Viewers could also watch Indian movies and music on Zee TV , then a fledgling joint venture between the News Corporation and an Indian entrepreneur . <p> Previously , India 's ruling elite had a dual and somewhat contradictory view of broadcasting . On the one hand , politicians considered it too powerful a force to be left to the private sector , especially in the years after independence in 1947 , when the nation 's unity and secularism were considered vulnerable . On the other hand , television was seen as too frivolous to merit much investment at a time when politicians were focused on turning India into an industrial power . <p> Those attitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 90s forced the Indian government to devalue its currency , the rupee , and to start relinquishing its tight control over the economy . Then , in 1995 , the country 's highest court declared the government 's monopoly over broadcasting unconstitutional . <p> When it did yield , India went further in deregulating television than it did in other sectors of the economy . It also gave up far more control when compared with China , the country against which it is most often measured . Foreign media companies can fully own entertainment networks here ; they can not in China . ( India does , however , limit foreign ownership to 26 percent of television news channels and newspapers . ) <p> THE open environment attracted the News Corporation , which entered the market in 1993 by acquiring Star TV . Star has the highest-rated shows among the private networks in Hindi-speaking parts of the country . Sony started its flagship channel here in 1995 and now has seven channels ; the company owns about 61 percent of the business , with Indian investors owning the rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which dominates ratings in non-Hindi-speaking southern India . <p> Still , Doordarshan , the public broadcaster , remains the most widely available network , especially in rural areas , where a majority of the population lives . <p> To keep up with changing times , Doordarshan has retooled its programming , adding genres like soap operas and musical contests to a lineup that is still dominated by more high-minded  --  and what some critics would call staid  --  cultural programming . It has also started a satellite-TV service that has no subscription fees but also does not include the most popular private channels . <p> Star has been one of the few consistently profitable businesses in Indian television . Although the News Corporation does not disclose financial details of its operations here , Merrill Lynch estimates that Star accounts for 3 percent of the company 's total operating income , or about $116 million in the 2006 fiscal year . <p> Zee , which started by offering a few hours of programming a day , now has more than two dozen channels ; it started a satellite-TV service , DishTV , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadcaster , Doordarshan , from which urban audiences felt disconnected , " said Ashish Kaul , a senior vice president at Zee . " You can not blame Doordarshan ; it had a national obligation . " <p> About 60 percent of the nation 's television households subscribe to the cable or satellite services that carry private channels . Though Indians theoretically have dozens of channels to choose from , a handful dominate the ratings and earn most of the profits . A fragmented cable business is straining to reshape itself in response to new regulations and competition from satellite television services . <p> The transition to digital cable , meanwhile , has so far occurred only in parts of India 's four most populous cities . The changeover has been troubled by technical problems , weak enforcement of a Jan. 1 deadline and a shortage of set-top boxes . <p> At the same time , the newest technology operates alongside the often stark economic and social realities of India . Black-and-white televisions still account for an estimated 40 percent of all TV 's in use , and about 56 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India 's 2001 census . And because most homes in India that have a television havejust one set , watching TV can be a communal activity that brings together the entire family , and often the neighbors , too . <p> Perhaps the most striking of the changes in Indian television is what is starting to show up on the screen . <p> " Dhoom Machaoo Dhoom " ( Hindi for " Let 's have a blast " ) is a Disney show aimed at teenagers , and it might look at home on the Disney Channel in the United States . It is about four teenage girls , one of them from New York , who want to start a band so they can represent their school in a talent contest . They face a number of challenges , including an arrogant classmate who is determined to derail their plans . <p> But the show , which went on the air last month , has an Indian twist . Priyanka , the New Yorker who has returned to her family 's native land , wants the girls to perform a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a popular Bollywood movie , as the local norms dictate . In one episode , Kajal , played by Sriti Jha , complains that Priyanka does n't understand India . " Only Bollywood works here , " she insists . <p> The girls do not dwell on the issue , but it is an important consideration for television executives and media companies here . Indian television has a strong partnership with the film industry , whose stars appear on its shows as guests , contestants and hosts . Movies and music videos from Bollywood remain staples on television here . <p> Yet in the last decade television has attained influence over the popular culture that is starting to rival that of the film business . And whereas filmmakers have traditionally worked in close-knit networks that operate in a single language , media companies have been exploiting the large and growing capacity of cable and satellite networks to cheaply develop customized channels and shows for different parts of the country . Zee , for instance , operates several regional-language entertainment and news channels . <p> " We have a vibrant TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose clients include Disney and who also writes a column for The Economic Times . " When talking about the hinterland , TV is what Bollywood would like to be . " <p> Nachiket Pantvaidya , an executive director at Disney 's Indian operations , predicted that " Dhoom " would be a breakthrough for Indian television because it was one of the few shows produced for teenagers , and specifically for girls . He said that more than 90 percent of what Indian youths watch on TV are family dramas and other shows created for their parents . <p> " This is a story of kids who are trying to do something out of the ordinary , " Mr. Pantvaidya said . " Nobody makes TV for the real world . This kind of TV is rare . " <p> Ms. Jha , the 20-year-old who plays one of the girls on " Dhoom , " added : " This ca n't be compared to the whole lot of family serials . This is much more real and close to the lives of kids . " <p> " Dhoom " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India  --  its first , " Vicky Aur Vetaal , " was based on an Indian myth about a prince and a genie-like figure . The company sees television as the first step in a broader India strategy that includes films , merchandising and possibly a theme park . Last year , Disney spent $44.5 million to acquire a 15 percent stake in UTV , a production company based in Mumbai , and to buy Hungama , a television channel of children 's programming created by UTV . <p> " We decided early on that this had to be driven locally , " said Gary Marsh , president of entertainment for Disney Channel Worldwide in Burbank , Calif . " If we were to truly become a global company , we had to let our regional organizations create their own programming . " India was the first country where the company developed local Disney Channel shows , something it is now doing in Britain and Japan , too . <p> Many of Disney 's competitors have built their businesses on a similar strategy . Time Warner , which operates the Pogo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of " Sesame Street " called " Galli Galli Sim Sim . " The show uses some material from the popular American show , but it is set on an Indian streetscape and is anchored by four local Muppets . A large orange-and-red lion named Boombah replaces Big Bird . <p> Television executives say the ventures by Disney and others aimed at youths and various niche markets are a welcome break from the way business has been done in India . A handful of channels  --  which carry soap operas , reality shows , music shows and important cricket tournaments  --  receive the bulk of the advertising . Yet entrepreneurs continue spending millions of dollars starting copycat networks . India has more than 40 cable news channels , for example . <p> " Here it is , we have 200 channels of the same stuff , and people are saying let 's do more of it , " said Sameer Nair , chief executive of Star Entertainment , a News Corporation subsidiary . " That will churn and change . " ( In an indication that competition is intensifying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Star in March . According to news reports , he will be helping a rival Indian-owned TV company start a new entertainment channel . ) <p> AS media executives try to introduce innovative programming , exactly what can go on the air in India remains fluid . There is no overt censorship of television content , but most media companies say they aggressively police themselves to avoid running afoul of political and cultural mores . <p> Several movie channels were forced to go off the air for more than a week last summer when a court in Mumbai ruled in favor of a schoolteacher who had argued that films that had been rated for adult viewing only in their cinematic release could not be shown on television without being edited and recertified for a wider audience . <p> In some ways , television fare in India today is far more adventurous than it was even five years ago . A recent adaptation of " Big Brother , " known here as " Bigg Boss , " for instance , has stirred the pot by showing minor celebrities behaving badly . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see famous people as human beings , said Kunal Dasgupta , who heads Sony 's Indian television operations , which broadcasts the show . <p> Still , Mr. Dasgupta knows that social customs evolve slowly here . He said he was considering " with kid gloves " a proposal from an Italian company to help produce a miniseries that would be based loosely on the life of Sonia Gandhi , the Italian-born leader of India 's ruling Congress Party who is the widow of the former prime minister , Rajiv Gandhi . <p> The proposal calls for an Indian cast , but the series would take an " Italian perspective , " Mr. Dasgupta said . " I find it very exciting and challenging , " he said . " At the same time , knowing our own media , we could be ripped apart . " He said he was " trying to see if we can get people who are really in power to accept that if we do such a thing it will be O.K. " <p> The fact that he is even considering such a proposal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And as the country continues to experience major economic and social changes , the shape of Indian television is likely to keep evolving. ##
