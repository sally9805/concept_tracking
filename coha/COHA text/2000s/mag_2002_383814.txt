Setting New Standards for Excellence Photograph // This February , the gates of Salt Lake City 's Rice-Eccles Stadium will open as an Olympic torchbearing runner is welcomed inside , officially beginning the 2002 Winter Olympics . Over the next few weeks , TV networks and sports pages will surge with news from Salt Lake City , and audiences will struggle to make out the faces and country I.D.s as athletes in snowsuits and huge goggles make their way down slopes and luge canals . At this writing , we do n't know the winners of the 2002 Winter Olympics . But other winners are not competing in February at all . These are the hardworking and very competitive athletes of the 2002 Paralympics , or " parallel Olympics , " which takes place from March 7 to 16 . More than a thousand people with disabilities , from 35 countries , will be cheered on by an expected sell-out crowd of 45,000 . It 's a long way from the first Paralympics in 1960 , when fewer than 400 athletes competed . They were not even housed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned by the Salt Lake Olympic Committee , uses the same facilities , and aspires to the same level of excellence . " We 've gone from disabled sport as a sideshow to being recognized all over the world , " says Paul di Bello , competition director for the National Sports Center for the Disabled , himself a Paralympic medalist in alpine skiing . As a disabled athlete , it 's been very rewarding to see . " In Salt Lake City , you 'll see 26 separate events , in four disciplines : Alpine skiing . In the slalom , giant slalom , and super-G downhill , each event is further broken down by type of disability-including events for skiers who are blind as well as for those with a range of mobility impairments . Some will ski standing , usually with the help of outriggers or " ski bras " ( see sidebar on page 22 ) . The super-fast sit-skiers will make it downhill in record time on a specially molded seat atop either one ( mono- ) or two ( bi- ) skis . Top alpine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet those in Olympic competition ! Cross-country skiing . Cross-country and relay ski events are also broken down by disability . Standing skiers will be competing in both classical style ( standard ) and freestyle ( one leg back , skating-style ) . " There 's disagreement on which is easier , " says Jon Kreamelmeyer , the coach for this year 's team . " Some say one ski is easier , others like the balance of two . " Ice sledge hockey . Fast , furious , fractious-all still apply when the teams are on sleds , using specially built sticks that can both propel the player and be used to shoot the puck across the ice . There 's a hockey tournament going on every day of the Paralympics . Biathlon . A combination of ski racing and marksmanship . Visually impaired skiers will be using special acoustic rifles that shoot a beam of light and sound , with the result recorded acoustically . Everyone elsE uses harmless pellet rifles . The winter event is growing slowly , and it 's small compared with the Summer Paralympics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , in Sydney in 2000 , a turnout of 100,000 fans . As the winter event grows , new sports are being added : the 2006 Paralympics , in Torino , Italy , will also feature ice racing and wheelchair ice dancing , and may include wheelchair curling . MS athletes have n't shown up for Winter Paralympics-yet The Summer PAralympics have boasted their share of athletes with MS . For example , Laura Schwanger , who has competed in the shot put , javelin , and discus competitions in three Paralympic Games : 1988 in Seoul , Korea ; 1992 in Barcelona , Spain ; and 1996 in Atlanta , Georgia . She won four gold medals , six silvers , and one bronze . Anne Dunham , a British equestrian who was diagnosed with MS more than 20 years ago , won both the Individual Gold and Team Silver medals at the 1994 World Championships before taking her horse and her heart to gold-medal victory in Atlanta . These athletes competed , and won , despite the famous MS heat-sensitivity . Competition in cold , one might think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , not fewer , Paralympic athletes with MS in the winter events . Among the winter torchbearers taking the flame to Utah are Zoe Koplowitz , 14-time last-place " winner " in the New York City marathon ; Kelly Walker Haley , a top fund-raiser and volunteer at the Colorado Chapter ; and Pam Hensley , who has completed ten MS 150 bike events , despite her MS . But this writer was unable to find anyone from the United States with MS among past or present Winter Paralympians . Photograph Laura Schwanger // Why ? Di Bello , of the National Sports Center , said simply : " The inconsistency of the disease makes it hard to train . " Echoing him is former Olympic skier Jimmie Heuga , who 's spearheaded sports for people with MS for nearly 20 years . He never tried out for the Paralympics because " my situation changes throughout the day . Balance , vision ... it 'll change over the course of 15 minutes sometimes . " The rapid shift from cold to heat that occurs during winter training is also hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems evolve ? Dr. Patricia Coyle , professor of neurology and director of the Multiple Sclerosis Comprehensive Care Center at the State University of New York at Stony Brook , says : " There 's no reason why a person with MS can not train at that level . I think if someone were to decide to try , they could even get funding to support them . " This winter , the Paralympians inspire the rest of us to do our own personal best , even if we 're not trying to break any records .

They use props-like sliding walkers for people with balance problems . O'Donnell says that some people with balance and mobility impairments find that skating helps them .

Today 's snowshoes , as the folks at Maine Handicapped Skiing happily point out , are far smaller and lighter than the behemoths of yesteryear . While snowshoeing requires independent leg motion , it is easier for folks with balance difficulties , or who want a slower pace to enjoy the peaceful snow . Even if we 're not up to team sports , almost all of us can enjoy ice fishing , snowmobiling , and even snowball fights . So plan to get out in the snow and play !
