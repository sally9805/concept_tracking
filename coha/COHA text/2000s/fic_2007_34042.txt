Chapter One " My darling , I want to touch you everywhere , " Lars whispered . Miranda shivered as his long , elegant fingers slid down the flat plane of her belly , his skin so dark against her own pale flesh . His hardness stirred against her bare leg and she gasped . Soon he would drive that thick column of flesh inside her . Could she possibly bear it ? A soft mewl escaped her lips as his hand drifted to the delta of springy curls between her thighs . She squirmed in embarrassment as his fingers tickled the entrance of her body , finding her shamefully wet , aching for his touch . " Oh , Miranda , " Lars sighed , groaning in approval as he felt her wet welcome . " Have you any idea how long I 've wanted to touch you like this , how I 've ached to slide inside the sweet petals of your womanhood ... " Lauren put the book facedown on her bedside table and closed her eyes . Her hand slid down to the waistband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In her mind , Miranda 's silvery blond hair became a mass of cinnamon curls , and her petite , delicate figure became Lauren 's own strong , curvy form . Lars morphed too , his burnished gold hair turning thick and black , his burning blue eyes melting into deep , dark chocolate . She bit back a cry as her fingers found her slick , hot center , circling her clit , teasing herselfso this would n't all be over in less than a minute . Her hand became his-huge , strong and callused from work , rubbing , circling her clit , sliding inside her just enough to tantalize . Just enough to make her ache to feel the hot , huge length of his cock driving deep inside her . A muffled cry squeezed past her lips as she came , arching off the bed , pressing her hand firmly between her thighs to draw out her climax as long as possible . Before the last tremors of her orgasm had subsided , she flipped over onto her side , hugging a huge down pillow against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was him instead of a pillow . These ridiculous fantasies about Tony Donovan had to stop , or she was going to put her head through a brick wall . Never mind that Lauren had been telling herself the exact same thing for seven months now , ever since she 'd met him . And , she scolded herself silently , her steady habit of romance novels was n't helping matters . Could she help it if , no matter how the author described him , every damned hero ended up looking like Tony ? She closed her eyes and allowed herself one more glorious vision . Six foot three , a body that should be on the cover of Men 's Fitness magazine . Thick , dark hair with just the tiniest hint of curl and an adorable cowlick waving off his forehead . And his eyes , big , dark , and liquid . Eyes that made a woman think about drowning herself in chocolate so he could lick her clean . Cursing , she reached for the remote control and flicked on Sportscenter . Maybe that would distract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But not her lover . Never that . She listened with half an ear as the host made his predictions about tomorrow 's Oakland Raiders game . But most of her brain was still occupied by Tony . Wondering where he was , what he was doing . Who he was doing it with . She should go back to masturbating . At least those images of Tony did n't twist her guts until she thought she might throw up . Stupid jealousy . So unproductive , especially given how he felt about her . She cringed , remembering his invitation to join him and his brother Mike earlier tonight . " We 're going over to Pete 's in Tahoe City later on , " he 'd said over wings and beers at Sullivan 's pub . " Want to go ? " Lauren cast a glance at Mike 's wife , Karen . " Are you going ? " " No , " the other woman said . " I 've been on my feet all day and I 'm beat . " Mike rubbed her shoulders affectionately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wore better shoes . " He 'd looked pointedly at Karen 's stiletto-heeled boots . " You love my shoes and you know it , " Karen had replied and pulled Mike 's face down for a kiss that made the room temperature rise at least ten degrees . " Ugh , you guys are gross , " Tony said , sounding like a twelve-year-old afraid of cooties . " So , Lauren , " he 'd said . " You want to go ? " Go shoot the shit with Mike while she watched Tony roll up on some hot young thing ? No thanks . She 'd done plenty of that since she started working with the brothers at their building and renovation company seven months ago . But all she 'd said was , " Nah , sounds like you should have it be a guys ' night . " " Aw , Mac , " he 'd said with a grin and a squeeze of her shoulder . " You 're practically one of the guys . " She knew Tony loved to say things like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that comment had stung . Even more than his usual jokes about her masculine profession as a carpenter and her customary workman 's attire . Lauren thumbed the volume up on her remote , trying to drown out the evil voices in her head . Why are you surprised ? You know exactly how he sees you . Just one of the guys . An athletic , tomboy of a girl who 's great to hang out and drink beer with , but not a girl he 'd ever feel that way about . She sighed and flipped over to Saturday Night Live . Hugh Jackman was hosting , and he was almost enough to keep thoughts of Tony Donovan at bay . She 'd see him soon enough , her friend , her buddy , her pal . His friendship meant the world to her , so she would continue as she had , concealing any inkling of interest and enjoy the time she did spend with him . From the moment she met him , she 'd wanted to be his lover , but knew it would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she always did . Tony settled next to Lauren on the couch and stretched his arm along the back of the cushion behind her . He snuck a quick , jealous glance at his brother Mike and his wife , Karen , snuggled together on the short end of the sectional . Karen did n't even bother to pretend to pay attention to the game , but rested with her head in Mike 's lap as she read a paperback . Mike settled into the corner of the couch , absently playing with his wife 's hair . It still surprised him every time he saw them together . Mike , the least physically affectionate person in the family , could n't keep his hands off his wife . As though he needed to have constant contact to make sure she was still here . Although , Tony supposed , considering their rocky path to love , he supposed he could n't blame them . His lips pursed into a frown . This was his couch , his house . If anyone should be snuggling down in front of the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to content himself with sitting next to Lauren . Almost , but not close enough for his thigh to press against hers . His hand dangled off the back of the couch . Almost , but not quite touching the thick reddish-brown curls that hung down past her shoulders . " Yes ! " Lauren and Mike shot off the couch simultaneously , arms up in wide vees . " GO GO GO , " Lauren shouted , and Tony finally focused on his 42-inch-wide TV screen . " Did you see that pass ? " Lauren looked down at him , amber eyes sparkling with excitement . He 'd missed the entire play . " Yeah , it was nice . " " Nice ? It was a thing of beauty . " She and Mike settled back on their respective ends of the couches , and Tony was hard-pressed not to pull her flush against him . An urge that became even harder to resist when Lauren stripped off her fleece pullover . The mountain weather had turned chilly in the past week , but Tony 's house was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's a sauna in here , Ton , " she said , fanning herself a little before she sat back against the overstuffed cushions . " I like it hot , " he replied , and took a long pull at his beer . He tried not to think about how good she smelled , soft and fresh . And she always smelled good , even after a hot day under the sun doing manual labor . The clean scent emanated from her pores until he wanted to bury his head between her breasts and soak her up . Oh , bad idea , thinking about her breasts . He shifted and tugged at the leg of his jeans . He nonchalantly rested his foot on the coffee table and bent his knee to shield the rapidly growing bulge in his fly . But really , she did have a fantastic rack , showcased very nicely today in a T-shirt that read " JUICY . " She had a fantastic everything , as far as he was concerned . He shot up off the couch to get another beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dick to sleep . He did n't have much hope it would work , but it gave him an excuse to retreat to the kitchen and get a handle on himself . He remembered the first day he 'd met Lauren . Mike had hired her after their youngest brother , Nick , moved to Palo Alto to live with his fiance . Tony had been skeptical about hiring a woman , but she came with great recommendations and proved that first day to be a highly skilled , motivated worker . Of course he 'd been attracted to her , with her comic strip heroine 's body , all juicy curves and nicely defined muscles . And that hair . A riot of reddish brown corkscrew curls tumbling around her shoulders . With hair like that , you just knew she 'd be a fuckin ' wildcat in the sack . Topped off with her wide smile and whiskey-brown eyes full of warmth , and she was almost irresistible . But unlike most women he came across , she showed absolutely no awareness of him as a man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep with women he was likely to run into on a regular basis . And the real clincher had come later that week . They were finishing up on a remodel job out in the Lakeview Estates . Mike was pushing them to complete the job so they could have the rare privilege of telling a client they 'd actually finished ahead of schedule . But at about six-thirty Lauren had started looking at her watch . And by seven she 'd mustered up the courage to ask her new boss when he thought they might finish . Mike 's brow had furrowed and he 'd shot Lauren that intimidating look Tony knew he practiced in the mirror . Tony knew because he 'd once caught Mike at it . " Do you have somewhere you need to be ? " But Lauren had n't flinched . She 'd just smiled that wide , laughing smile and said , " Not really . But the Sharks are playing and- " " Ah , a woman after my own heart , " Tony had said , looping his arm over her shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow we 'll still be two days ahead of schedule . You can come over and watch it on my plasma-screen . " Lauren 's mouth had gone slightly slack and her gaze blurred . It was a look he 'd only ever seen on a woman 's face when he was buried deep inside her . " A plasma-screen ? " she 'd murmured lustfully . " You have a plasma-screen ? " At that moment Tony had a startling revelation . He 'd finally met a woman he liked too much to fuck . For the past seven months he 'd shoved any and all sexual thoughts aside and settled into a comfy friendship . They did almost everything together , from work , to working out , to watching sports on the plasma-screen she so openly coveted . Unfortunately the lust he felt every time he saw her was becoming exceedingly difficult to resist . First he had to work with her through the hot summer , her long muscular legs showcased in cargo shorts while her D-cups strained against a tank top . The image was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glistening with sweat , khaki shorts hugging the firm curve of her ass . He 'd spent the entire summer resisting the urge to yank down her shorts and bury his mouth in the moist , gingery curls of her pussy . He grabbed another Dos Equis and held the nearly empty bag of chips in front of his crotch for good measure . He settled back on the couch , nearly groaning when she reached into the bag of chips he still held on his lap . Her hand brushed repeatedly against his cock as she rooted around for more than crumbs , and he wondered how the hell she could be so fucking sexy in a T-shirt and jeans hiding those world-class legs . And she had no fucking clue , he thought angrily , as her gaze remained guilelessly fixed on the game . Karen and Mike were nuzzling and whispering on the other end of the couch and Tony bit back a demand for them to get a room . It was a good thing they were here . God knew what stupid moves he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he grumbled silently , that had worked without failure in the past . But for whatever reason , Lauren was completely unaware of him sexually . Which was a good thing , he reminded himself , because if she showed the slightest bit of interest , offered the tiniest bit of encouragement , he knew he would n't be able to hold himself back . He had no faith in his self-restraint . And then he 'd be down one very good friend , which in his experience was much harder to come by than lovers . He was startled from his musings by a shrill , electronic version of the William Tell overture . Lauren squirmed to get her phone out her pocket and he savored the sensation of her firmly curved hip rubbing against his thigh . Would have been nice if she 'd been a few more inches to the left , but he had to take what he could get . Lauren frowned at the caller ID display and flipped open the phone . " Hi Mom ... yeah . Yeah . Of course I 'm coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , yet . " She smiled tightly at Mike . " No , Mike 's really great , I 'm sure he 'll let me , " she grinned and winked at Mike , who grinned back and mouthed , " No way . " " I do n't think so , Mom . I know , I know , I just ... " Her gaze met Tony 's for a half second before flicking away , hidden by a sweep of dark amber lashes . She went silent and cinnamon-colored brows knit furiously over her small , straight nose . " Motherrrrr ! " She sounded like an exasperated adolescent . " I know there 's nothing wrong with that ! Jesus , Mom , give me a break ! " She rolled her eyes at whatever her mother was saying . " Well , do n't . It 's fine . Fantastic , in fact . Yeah , I 'll see you in a week . " She flicked the phone closed and let out an exasperated sigh and flopped back against the sofa cushions . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her expectantly . " My mother thinks I 'm a lesbian . " Mike and Karen laughed , but Tony just raised his eyebrows . Lauren brandished her phone threateningly . " If you say anything , I 'll pound you . " Typical Tony-he could n't resist the opportunity to needle her . " I do n't know where she 'd get that idea . You 're so girly and feminine in your denim and flannel . " He choked on a laugh as Lauren launched herself on top of him and tried to pin him to the couch . She shrieked as he rolled over and knocked her to the floor . She made a pretty good show of trying to get away while her struggles afforded her the perfect opportunity to rub against Tony like a cat in heat . She even got a full-second ass grab in there under the guise of trying to roll him over . Sad , yes , but a girl had to get her thrills where she could find them . And despite her masculine profession and affinity for flannel , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed back onto the couch . Not that she could blame her mother for her suspicions . Her mother-well she had her own ideas about sexuality , namely , that if you were young and healthy you should be doing it as often as possible . Carly MacLean could n't imagine a world in which a willing woman was n't getting laid , and often . So if there was n't a man in her youngest child 's life , there must be a woman . " I could give you a mullet and complete the image , if you want . " Karen , a hairdresser , giggled and ducked when Lauren pegged her with a pretzel twist . " Shut up , it 's not funny , " Lauren said , laughing . " You do n't understand . My mom is obsessed with my sex life , or lack thereof , " she said with a roll of her eyes . " And now she 's telling everyone I 'm a lesbian . " " Why do you care , anyway ? " Mike asked around a mouthful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will reach here . " Lauren sighed . " My parents are having a thirtieth wedding anniversary in two weeks , with a big reception , renewal of vows , the whole thing . My mom keeps pestering me to bring a date , and now that she 's got this idea in her head , no doubt she 'll invite some prospects . " She sat back and covered her face with her hands . " She even asked me if I go for the more butch or the more lipstick types . " " Oh , lipstick , definitely . And I want to watch , " Tony said . Lauren was about to punch him again , but something in his eyes stopped her . A heated glint lurked behind his amusement . Even teasing her , Tony oozed sexual heat . It was in the tone of his voice , the deep richness of his eyes , the way he moved with lazy athletic grace . (
