<p> They 're cheering my son ; from the dugout they 're chanting his name , a Hebrew name they 've never encountered before . I 've grown accustomed to this ; he 's a lefty pitcher with a mean natural curve . <p> In the Irish-Catholic enclave of the Bronx where we lived last year and he won the Little League Cy Young award , no one asked why his name was n't Sean or Patrick . That 's New York . <p> This year we 're living in Florence , Italy , but surprisingly , here , too , we 've found baseball - and a powerful common denominator . Indeed , many Italian boys have never met a Jew in their lives . But , united by the great American phenomenon of baseball , no one is inclined to focus on differences . <p> We 're in Nettuno , at a four-day Little League tournament ; we 're Florence , and are pitted against Turin , Grosseto , and the reigning Nettuno champs . <p> Among the outdoor tables and chairs at the cafe behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass . Fans milling about sip espresso , snack on panini and gelato , and parents call out from the bleachers in Italian . Otherwise , you 'd never know this was anywhere but in the US . <p> A coastal town south of Rome , Nettuno is most widely known as the site where the Allies landed to liberate Italy in 1943 - and where , shortly afterward , GIs introduced that most American of all sports to Italy . <p> " Baseball actually started in Italy at the American cemetery right after the landing , " says Brooklyn-born Joseph Bevilacqua , who first arrived in Italy as a GI in 1955 and now serves as superintendent of the American military cemetery and memorial , a somber 77-acre site on the northern edge of Nettuno . It contains the remains of 7,371 American soldiers and commemorates another 490 unknown and 3,095 missing . <p> " We had GIs in foxholes in the general area of the cemetery , which had been a grape vineyard , " relates Mr. Bevilacqua . " Some were hitting a baseball with a bat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Italian kids watching - and then they started chasing balls , too . <p> Like the Little League World Series venue in Williamsport , Pa. , the Nettuno baseball complex sits on the site of a former garbage dump , the stadium lovingly built with elbow grease by a handful of American soldiers driven by pangs of long-distance baseball passion . <p> Three bases , a home plate , a pitcher 's mound , a few wooden bats , and some home-grown American spirit , it appears , were all that were needed to win the hearts and minds of the locals in the months and years after the arrival of the US military . <p> Today , those early efforts are still paying off in a burgeoning Little League network and a fledgling professional federation . <p> " The first commander of the burial unit at the cemetery started the first Italian team , which consisted of most of the cemetery workers , " says Bevilacqua . " He trained them and taught them how to play , remained after military service , and was the first manager/trainer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nettuno complex boasts three diamonds , a snack bar , and a stadium rivaling any American minor-league set-up . It 's also home to the offices of manager Alfonso Gualtieri . Rumored to be an unofficial scout for the Florida Marlins , Mr. Gualtieri beams as he points out the photographs lining the walls of his office - there he is , posing with Barry Bonds ; there , with Tom Lasorda when he managed the Los Angeles Dodgers ; and there , that 's a shot of the scoreboard at San Francisco 's 3-Comm Park welcoming the Nettuno Lions . <p> The American advantage <p> Military bases still spawn much of the baseball spirit , and often provide equipment as well , so towns such as Grosetto - once the site of an important American air strip - are known to enjoy consistently high levels of playing . Florence , however , has benefited from the constant influx of college students spending a year abroad - many of whom head to the Campo di Marte baseball stadium for practice . <p> A cultural mecca such as Florence also enjoys a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an American or two playing on the Florentine Little League team every year , and during one recent season that team boasted three American players , making it the status symbol of the region . <p> Other towns , such as Rimini , Parma , and Palermo , boast winning semipro teams akin to the American Triple A division , and the halo effect extends to a Little League aura of confidence - and good strong playing . <p> By now , between 4,000 and 5,000 boys make up 200 Little League teams across Italy ; girls ' softball teams are beginning to form , too . <p> As in every red-blooded Little League community , games in Italy run throughout the summer ; rules and base paths are in strict compliance with American Little League regulations . Ask for the count , however , and you may get the feeling you 're not on home turf : Out may sound more like fuori ; Safe will sound like salvo ; coaches urging their outfielders to " throw it home , " shout " A casa ! A casa ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike 's a strike - and tre strikes always mean you 're out . Er , make that fuori . <p> Here in Italy , there 's no televised Major League Baseball coverage . Professionals can hope to pull in $ 36,000 a year , maximum . Yet there 's a thriving cult baseball phenomenon . <p> Fame and fortune , status and power go to the soccer players . So what 's driving the Italian passion for baseball ? Amore . Sheer love of the game . <p> At first , perhaps , it was the novelty . " When the GIs came , it was a new sport for us - and we love new things , here in Italy , " says Giannini Pinto , president of the regional baseball federation in Tuscany . But more than half a century later , there 's clearly more to it . <p> Mr. Pinto attributes it to the deep appreciation Italians have for true beauty and grace : The same culture that gave us Ferraris , Pucci , and Michelangelo ca n't help feeling passion for the aesthetics of baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport that 's easy to fall in love with , " he says , " and if you fall in love with it , it refuses to leave you alone , because it 's too beautiful . Anyone who has watched really good baseball knows it 's like a very graceful dance . " <p> Then too , there 's admiration for what some might call the " American spirit " of the game . " There 's a lot of respect in baseball , " Pinto notes , " and a spirit of gamesmanship . It 's an intellectual sport that requires mental focus ; it 's a team sport but in fact , it 's a sport of individuals and a culture of community . Baseball teaches you to compete with self-control , without unbridled aggression . The culture of soccer , which is so popular in Italy , is much more aggressive and violent ; fans of each team are kept on separate sides of the stadium because otherwise , it would be mayhem . But the rivalry in baseball is n't ugly or violent . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - even when it 's the Yankees against the Mets ; even if the team loses . There 's a spirit of respect and sportsmanship , and there are no real feelings of hate . " <p> Expatriate Jeannie Finocchiaro concurs . The mother of a 13-year-old with a penchant for stealing bases , Ms. Finocchiaro - who arrived in Italy 30 years ago as a college student and never left - has veered away from soccer because " it 's become so aggressive and violent . " <p> " Baseball is a sport where you can build real friendships with your teammates , " she adds . " It teaches strategic thinking . It also gives my son a way to relate better with his cousins in the States . And , of course , " the American abroad finally admits with a laugh , " I 'm fond of it myself ; it 's bringing me a little bit of home . " <p> The learning curve is steep <p> Like Americans struggling to make a real Spaghetti Alla Carrettiera , however , Italian sluggers face handicaps . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball federation 's Florence coordinator , " the kids already know how to hold the ball and swing the bat when they start playing in the Little League . They know the rules because it 's so deeply embedded in American culture . American kids see it everywhere and learn by imitating the older players . By the time Americans get to the diamond , a lot of the coach 's work is already done . " <p> In contrast , he notes , " here , you need to start by teaching them where first base is . It takes months just to develop the basics . Baseball is a very difficult sport , and it takes time to develop skills - but Italian kids these days tend to want things immediately . " <p> Nevertheless , Italian baseball is making inroads into the national consciousness . Mr.Ranieri - a physical education teacher who has been playing baseball for Florence since he was 9 years old and lived across the street from a diamond - is taking baseball to Italian elementary schools . <p> There will be an Italian baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a new program is launching next year in Terrenia , which will offer full academic/sports scholarships to 10 athletes who will live in dorms at an immersion center , continue their formal academic studies in the Pisa/Livorno area , and train for a professional career in baseball under the guidance of members of the Italian national team . <p> In the meantime , many of the best Italian Little Leaguers are California-bound come August , when they will travel to San Diego and San Francisco for two weeks of global competition . <p> There , pitted against Brazil , Japan , South Korea , and Mexico , they will rejoice in the universal language of baseball . And just as surely , will laugh gleefully at the local Spaghetti Alla Carrettiera . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
