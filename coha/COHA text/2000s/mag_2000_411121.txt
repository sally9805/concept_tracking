In November 1998 , British scholar Bruce Lloyd 's database of " Wisdom of the World " quotations was posted on the World Future Society 's Web site in a project designed to gather ideas about the nature of wisdom . Here , he reflects on the project and what we have yet to learn about wisdom . // Over the past decade , businesses and other organizations have begun to-recognize the importance of learning as a competitive strategy . I certainly do not find it surprising that , in the past few years , this focus on learning has been extended into a whole new industry called Knowledge Management . Obviously , if we are concerned with learning , it is natural to ask what we are learning and , perhaps even more importantly , what we need to learn . This development has coincided with the widespread use of computers that has created massive new challenges from what is known as the " information explosion . " In parallel , there has been the influence of the new millennium itself . This event is probably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much intellectual effort been focused on reflecting on-and learning from-our history . In essence , that reflective learning should start by trying to define what has been distilled into wisdom . This effort has focused on exploring three key questions : Where have we come from ? What are we doing here ? and Where are we going ? To start with , we need to recognize that , the more change there is in society , the more important it is to make sure that our learning is as effective as possible . That is the only way we will be able to equate change with progress . So , if we want to have a better future , our first and most important task is to improve the quality and effectiveness of our learning . An underlying assumption of the word " learning " is that we are all trying to do things better . We are trying to improve things . We are trying to make progress . Of course , the concepts behind the words improve , better , and progress are powerfully values driven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask ourselves : What is wisdom ? How do we learn it ? and How can we pass it on more effectively ? Wisdom may be defined as useful knowledge with a long shelf life . There is a close link among data , information , knowledge , and wisdom . But how does wisdom arise from the data , information , and knowledge spectrum ? I would argue that we start with wisdom , and that provides the framework within which to manage knowledge , and so on through information to data . Without an effective base at one level , it is impossible to manage effectively the next layer up . It is also quite justifiable to argue that knowledge is information in use and wisdom is the combination of knowledge and values . Hence the link between wisdom and my interest in strategy and knowledge management . That interest was reinforced , by coincidence , a couple of years ago , when I started , more as a hobby than anything else , collecting what I considered to be the important quotations that contained long-shelf-life knowledge ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high priority in what we consider passing on to the next generation , if we want to make the world a better place in the future . Photograph " Where is the life we have lost in living ? Where is the wisdom we have lost in Knowledge ? Where is the knowledge we have lost in information ? " // The results were posted on the World Future Society 's Web site in 1998 , together with an invitation to submit more wisdom quotations . To date , more than 130 new quotations have been added . I am keen to get the sources of the quotations correct , but my emphasis is on the messages themselves , rather than the messengers . In many cases there is considerable disagreement over who said what-and that can be a preoccupation for historians . But futurists , in my view , should give priority to the message rather than the messenger . Consequently , at this point , I just wish to focus on what we might learn from the past . Wisdom in Action Wisdom is one thing ; being wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to recycle wisdom-it involves the ability to apply wisdom in practice . " Those who are arrogant with their wisdom are not wise . " ( Anon . ) In theory at least , once we can agree on the important messages , it should not be too difficult to ensure that there are appropriate channels for the effective learning of these messages . Also we may assume that , if we have learned the right things , we ought to be in a position to do the right thing with that knowledge . Of course , that is an assumption , and there are perhaps more issues in that jump from knowledge to action than are normally recognized . But , if that is the case , then we probably need to revisit the messages of wisdom to ensure that we give a higher priority to those that reflect the importance of meaning and motivation in human behavior . This is not an academic exercise . Our future is critically dependent on what we learn , and , unless this subject is given much greater attention , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to define it . There is enormous scope for debate , both practical and philosophical , about the specific wisdom statements identified . It only really becomes important when we try to establish priorities , which of course we always need to do . However , at this stage of the " Wisdom of the World " project , I am just concerned with operating an open system that encourages as many ideas from as wide a variety of sources as possible . There are grounds for optimism . The important messages appear to be relatively simple . But that could also support the case for pessimism , as history seems to show that it is incredibly easy to ignore the experiences of earlier millennia . Do we accept the comment of Count Oxenstierna ( Swedish statesman , 1583-1654 ) , " Dost thou not know , my son , with how little wisdom the world is governed ? " How much better the world would be if we could make just a small improvement . But to use another quote : " If we still have not learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we suddenly start being able to learn them now ? " ( Anon . ) Or to put it another way , " The only lesson we can learn from history is that we do n't learn the lessons of history . " ( Anon . ) Photograph " The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today . Let us move forward with strong and active faith . " // Perhaps that quotation is right . But surely the case for making an effort is overwhelming , since things are likely to be so much worse if we do n't even try ! Timeless and Timely Insights From the attempt to produce a distillation of the " Wisdom of the World , " reflected by the sayings of those who have considered these issues , it is clear that , despite the enormous changes and an enormous increase in what has been written in the last two or three thousand years , we as individuals ( and as a society ) appear to be little the wiser . Why has not all this increased effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wiser actions ? Many of the important messages about the state and future of the human race were made over a thousand years ago , in China , the Middle East , and other parts of the world where early , sophisticated societies had developed . This should not surprise us . Wisdom consists of insights that have stood the test of time because they are concerned with making statements about relationships between people , either individually or in a societal context , or about our relationship with the universe as a whole . It should not surprise us that many of the comments quoted have religious roots . Among our wisdom messages are insights about wisdom itself that have stood the test of time : " Everyone whose deeds are more than their wisdom , their wisdom endures . And everyone whose wisdom is more than their deeds , their wisdom does not endure . " The Talmud " It is better to have wisdom without learning than learning without wisdom . " Charles Caleb Cotton ( English clergyman and writer , 17801832 ) " Knowledge and wisdom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present , we dream of the future , but we learn eternal truths from the past . " // Have oft times no connection . Knowledge dwells In heads replete with thoughts of other men : Wisdom in minds attentive to their own . Knowledge is proud that he has learned so much ; Wisdom is humble that he knows no more . " William Cowper ( English poet , 17311800 ) " Wisdom denotes the pursuing of the best ends by the best means . " Francis Hutcheson ( Scottish philosopher and professor , 1694-1746 ) The twentieth century , too , contributed wisdom that may endure : " Where is the life we have lost in living ? Where is the wisdom we have lost in Knowledge ? Where is the knowledge we have lost in information ? " T.S . Eliot ( American-born English poet , 1888-1965 ) " Exploring the question brings more wisdom than having the answer . " A Course irc Miracles ( 1975 ; Foundation for Inner Peace ) " The life of wisdom must be a life of contemplation combined with action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , born 1936 ) " No one can give you wisdom . You must discover it for yourself , on the journey through life , which no one can take for you . " Sun Bear ( Ojibwa medicine man and author , 1929-1992 ) Also , there is the well-known saying associated with the self-help movement : " Lord give me the courage to change that which can be changed , the serenity to accept that which can not be changed , and the wisdom to tell the difference . " This quotation contains some very important elements : The critical point here is that being able to tell what can and should be changed and what can not ( or should not ) depends on our underlying values . Values provide meaning , and it is meaning that drives action , so we need to get our basic values right . The core issue is that our values are the foundation on which everything else in society depends , and this is reflected in the wisdom drivers that influence our behavior , priorities , and decisions every day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general wisdom messages that we might like to pass on to future generations ? A brief selection : " Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell . " Edward Abbey ( American writer and conservationist , 1927-1989 ) " By doubting , we come to examine , and by examining , so we perceive the truth . " Peter Abelard ( French theologian , 1079-1142 ) " It is easier to fight for one 's principles than to live up to them . " Alfred Adler ( Austrian psychiatrist , 1870-1937 ) " If a man does away with his traditional way of living and throws away his good customs , he had better first make certain that he has something of value to replace them . " Basuto proverb " Greatness lies not in being strong , but in the right use of strength . " Henry Ward Beecher ( American clergyman and abolitionist , 1813-1887 ) " To see a world in a grain of sand And heaven in a wild flower , Hold infinity in the palm of your hand And eternity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and painter , 1757-1827 ) " Make ye the world a bit better or more beautiful because ye have lived in it . " Francis Bacon ( English philosopher and statesman , 15611626 ) And especially future-related wisdom quotations : " The future is purchased by the present . " Samuel Johnson ( English lexicographer and critic , 1709-1784 ) " The greatest challenge for democracy is to persuade people not to eat the seed corn of tomorrow 's harvest . " Clement Attlee ( British statesman and prime minister , 18831967 ) Wisdom is related to the way we use knowledge . The wise decision inevitably includes value judgments , beliefs , and feelings , as well as thoughts . It invariably involves moral choices . Hence it is not surprising that we find that the comments we might define as wisdom are essentially comments about relationships between people and/or people 's relationship with society and the universe . It should not surprise us that these are relatively timeless statements . But what certainly surprised me when I started looking at this subject was the gap between how critically important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is almost totally ignored in both futurist and knowledgemanagement literature . Another problem is that we are spending more and more time focusing on learning knowledge that has a short shelf life , and less and less on knowledge that overlaps with wisdom with a long shelf life . Why is that ? What can we do about it ? Do you agree ? If we think these issues are important , what do we need to do to make our educational system , and our society , work better in the future ? I would like to summarize my remarks by modifying the comments of T S. Eliot in the Choruses from The Rock in 1934 ( quoted above ) into : Where is the wisdom we have lost in chaos and complexity ? Where is the knowledge we have corrupted in " Knowledge is Power ' ' ? Where is the information we have lost in information overload ? Where is the data we have lost in answering the wrong questions ? Photograph " The philosophy of one century is the common sense of the next .

Bruce Lloyd : I would argue that " being wise " is something that people are , or become . In other words , it involves the doing , being , or application of wisdom . There are two key questions : First , How do you decide if a person is wise ? I would answer that it is through his or her ability to apply wisdom effectively in practice . Second , How do you decide if something can be defined as wisdom ? Wisdom is , in essence , universal , timeless , and useful in helping the world become a better place in the future . THE FUTURIST : What should we make of apparently contradictory bits of wisdom , such as " Haste makes waste " vs . " He who hesitates is lost " ? Lloyd : Another possible variation of the above is " A stitch in time saves nine . " Some elements of wisdom may be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course , that then requires judgment , and the only thing I can say here is that , the more our whole life is governed by a wisdom-driven agenda , the easier it will be to make the right judgment in different situations . THE FUTURIST : Many of the quotations in the " Wisdom of the World " database are from poetsnotably William Shakespeare , with more than a dozen quotes included . Do educators eschew the moralizing or wisdom aspects of poetry in favor of aesthetics ? Lloyd : In general , I think they do . It could be because they feel it is safer , more " politically correct " not to focus on the values underlying the messages . When it comes down to it , much wisdom might sound like little more than common sense , but if you really focus on applying it properly in practice , much of it would be quite revolutionary . Much of it would challenge the existing power structures of individuals and organizations . THE FUTURIST : You have said that wisdom is intimately tied to learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : We , at least in Britain , have spent much time " learning history . " The question is : What do we learn from history ? Unfortunately , teaching has tended to be indulgently involved in glorifying the past , rather than asking what we can learn from it . Very few historians appear to be active futurists . History ought to be an invaluable way to teach ( i.e. , learn about ) management . Management is basically about the use and abuse of power , but that approach to teaching history is , unfortunately , rarely the case .
