We , The Publicists <p> " Once a book is written , often the most important individual in an author 's life after the editor is the public relations person .... Stuart S. Applebaum , chief spokesman for Random House Inc ... describes his job this way : ' In giving life to a book , if the editor is the midwife , then we the publicists are the neo-natal nurses . All-purpose caregivers to both the newborn and the author-parent in those first six weeks . ' " <p> - Martin Arnold , " Pitchers at the Fair , " The New York Times , May 2 , 2002 . <p> WHEN I woke up that morning there was a strange man lying in bed between me and my wife . <p> The stranger had n't been there when Esther and I fell asleep last evening , shortly after the ten o'clock news . He must have crept into the house and insinuated himself in the middle of the night with the grace and guile of a cat . <p> Surprisingly enough , I did not immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from under the covers . ( The stranger , thank God , lay atop the duvet , not beneath . ) My unnaturally gentle and accepting reaction had more to do with the stranger 's reassuring looks and calm demeanor than with any resort to common sense . <p> The intruder wore a very expensive suit , remarkably unwrinkled despite his night 's recumbent posture . He was a clean-shaven Caucasian , fairly young , sporting an affable grin . He boasted a very nice haircut . From his hands folded across his stomach sparkled a college ring I recognized as belonging to a Princeton grad . <p> Generously allowing me a few moments to compose my thoughts , the stranger continued to beam at me , his tilted face just a few inches from mine . Then he reached into a coat pocket and pulled out a business card . <p> Feeling as if I were still dreaming , I took the card . I found my specs , donned them , and read the card . <p> HAPWOOD S. STUTTERBALM <p> CHIEF PUBLICIST <p> RUMDUM HOUSE PUBLISHING <p> Stutterbalm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took it . " Mr. McFoozel - may I call you Ken ? - it 's a pleasure to meet you at last . I ca n't tell you how much I enjoyed your book in manuscript . It 's Rumdum House 's very great privilege to publish your authorized biography of Britney Spears , She 's Stoopid to Conquer , and I 'm here now and for the next six weeks to make sure we maximize all the impact and rewards from your hard work and authorial brilliance . " <p> Of course , these were the kind of words every author dreams of hearing from his publisher , and I felt somewhat more kindly disposed to Stutterbalm , despite his unconventional entrance into my life . Still , I was at a loss as to how to treat this nocturnal intrusion . <p> Esther , always a heavy sleeper , moaned and mumbled , " Ken , shut the clock-radio off .... " She pulled the covers up over her head , and I could see that she was going to be absolutely no help in this situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please . Or Hap . Whatever makes it easier for us to work together . " <p> I found it impossible to raise any anger in the face of this disarming desire to accommodate me . " Well , uh , Hap , could we continue this conversation in the kitchen , please ? " <p> " Certainly . " <p> I slipped out of bed , scuffled into my slippers , donned my robe , and headed for the bathroom . <p> Stutterbalm vaulted agilely out of bed , and seemed ready to follow me into the John . He had a PDA in his hand and seemed to be inditing notes with his stylus . <p> " Please , er , Hap , could I have some privacy for just a moment ? " <p> " But Ken , it 's so important that I monitor all the intimate aspects of your life . There 's no telling what small detail might lead to a valuable tie-in for your book . For instance , based on what brand of toothpaste or toilet tissue you use , we might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 've already got you booked in forty-five cities , after all , at not inconsiderable expense . " <p> Forty-five cities ? I had needed six months to recover from my last tour , a ten-city number for my YA biography of the Russian president , Rootin ' Tootin ' , Sure-shootin ' Putin . What had I ever gotten my-self into by accepting this latest assignment ? The last female pop singer I had enjoyed listening to had been Carly Simon . I silently cursed my agent , and swore that I would never do another book on any starlet younger than seventy-two . <p> Stutterbalm waited patiently , stylus posed , a cocker-spaniel eagerness on his face . Forty-five cities indeed implied a certain level of sales .... <p> " Oh , all right , you can come in . But at least turn your back while I use the toilet . " <p> " Of course , Ken ! " <p> In the kitchen , Stutterbalm insisted on brewing the coffee and fixing me a large breakfast , all with gourmet provisions he had brought with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , I noted that he had made no arrangement for his own breakfast . <p> " Are n't you going to eat too ? " <p> " Not right now . Truly dedicated publicists generally fast during the six weeks while they 're nursing a book along . I 'll have a protein shake at noon . Right now we have to utilize every minute to groom and coach you for the rigors ahead . Just let me set up this camera - " <p> Unpacking a duffel bag he must have previously planted , Stutterbalm erected a video camera on a tripod , as well as some small studio lights . He snapped on the fixtures and I flinched at the wash of harsh radiance . He activated the camera and sat down across from me . <p> " We 'll skip the makeup just this once . Please , Ken , eat up ! This will be good practice for conducting interviews over coffee and Danish . Now , I 'll play the part of the interviewer , and you just be yourself . " <p> The mock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to taste a single forkful that went into my mouth . When we were done , Stutterbalm reviewed my performance in the camera 's small screen , clucking his tongue all the while . <p> " Well , Ken , I 'm afraid we have a long road to travel before you 're fit to appear on national TV . For one thing , we need to do something about that haircut . " <p> " But , but - I 've been wearing my hair like this for years . " <p> " Exactly the problem . Let me make an appointment for you for this afternoon with my stylist . " Whipping out his cell phone , Stutterbalm did just that . " Now , let 's try on some new clothes I 've taken the liberty of bringing . " <p> As Stutterbalm was expertly hemming the cuffs on my new trousers , Esther drooped into the kitchen . She was taken aback at first by this impromptu fitting , but when I explained that it was all part of the publicity for my new book , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Try some of those croissants , Mrs. McFoozel . They 're from a little bakery on the Upper West Side . " <p> " Mmmm , delicious ! " <p> How cheaply and quickly Esther had been won over by this PR tyrant ! Was I being an ingrate by harboring some small vestiges of resentment at this dictatorial treatment ? <p> Stutterbalm erased chalk marks off my tailored jacket . " There , perfect ! Now , let 's see your walk , Ken . Pretend you 're crossing the stage to receive a Pulitzer . " <p> " For a biography of Britney Spears ? " <p> " It could happen , " said Stutterbalm , winking and making a money-rubbing gesture with his fingertips . <p> I pranced up and down the kitchen for ten minutes , trying vainly to follow Stutterbalm 's suggestions about varying my stride . At last I had had enough of this vainglorious strutting , and said so . <p> " That 's fine , Ken , we can work more on the walk later . There 're plenty of other tasks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , much too time-consuming . You want to shorten it . After all , you might be doing thousands per day . " <p> " Th - thousands ? " <p> " Let 's work a little on your personal bio sheet . I 've got the one from your last book here . The first thing we 've got to change is your birth date . What say we make it , oh , 1972 ? " <p> " Do I look thirty years old to you ? " <p> " Oh , do n't worry , we 've budgeted plastic surgery . " Esther looked up from the newspaper hopefully . " Oh , yes , Mrs. McFoozel , for you as well . " <p> " But I- " <p> " Now , about your hobbies . We 've changed them to spear-fishing , snowboarding and bungee-jumping . Naturally you 'll need to acquire a modicum of proficiency in each of these areas . " <p> " I ca n't swim ! And I never go out in the snow without my galoshes . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . There 's nothing that ca n't be accomplished with a little effort and enough money . Do n't underestimate my determination or perseverance . You 're looking at a fellow who 's driven countless producers to madness and beyond . " <p> I collapsed into a chair . " And that 's just where you 're driving me ! I just do n't think I 'm up to the level of involvement in the publicity machine that you 're demanding of me . " <p> Stutterbalm patted me tenderly on the shoulder . " There , there , Ken . We 've anticipated that possibility as well . Take a look at these photos . " <p> I studied a sheaf of headshots . " Who are all these smiling idiots ? " <p> " Eager young actors and models looking to bulk up their CV . Any one of them will happily stand in for you throughout this whole process . A simple Mission : Impossible-style latex mask is all we need to fool your fans . Your signature right here makes it happen - " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forms as quickly as I could . <p> " Very good . Never let it be said that we were unwilling to give you a chance at the limelight , Ken . I 'm sorry it had to end this way , but I suspected it might , based on my many years as a ' nurse ' to authors . After all , as we publicists traditionally say : an actor masquerading as a writer is always a better bet than a writer masquerading as an actor . " <p>
