Ruby By Lauraine Snelling Bethany House Lauraine Snelling New York , April 1882 Scolding never did any good . Ruby Torvald , hands on her hips , glared at her nine-year-old sister . No , of course Opal had not meant to break the Dresden shepherdess . Of course she had only been looking at it . But how often had she been told to look , not touch ? " Opal , you knew better . " Strawberry curls flying rampant about her freckled cheeks in spite of the French braids Ruby had plaited so carefully that morning , Opal refused to meet her sister 's frowning gaze . " Uff da ! What am I going to do with you ? " What am I going to tell Mrs. Brandon , and more importantly , how am I going to pay for that ? Ruby picked up the pieces , halfheartedly fitting the full skirt onto the upper body , along with the head . As if any shepherdess would really wear a flouncy skirt like that and full petticoats too . Only the lamb at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the purpose of the figurine . " I ... I 'm sorry . " Ruby tried but failed to trap the sigh that seemed a continuation of many others . " I really am . " With the toe of her shoe , Opal traced the rose blossom woven into the Aubusson rug on which she stood . " I know you are . But you need to think of how sorry you might be before ... " Ruby laid the broken pieces in the trash basket at her feet . Perhaps if she rearranged the bric-a-brac on the whatnot table , Mrs. Brandon would never notice the shepherdess was missing . " Go back to the schoolroom and write fifty times on the board , ' I will not touch other people 's things . ' " " But , Ruby , I already did all my lessons , and you said we would go to the park after Bernie 's nap . " Ruby closed her eyes to steel herself against the beseeching looks from the young girl in front of her . She 'd had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died . How much easier life had been when they had lived with their grandmother . You must n't go around feeling sorry for yourself , she scolded . No one wants to attend a pity party , even though you 'd be the guest of honor . She pointed in the direction of the stairs , ignoring the last pleading look thrown over Opal 's sturdy shoulder . Ruby took the basket back to the kitchen and dropped the pieces in the garbage . " Not another one . " Mrs. Fleish , the head housekeeper of the Brandon mansion , gave Ruby a pitying glance . " Ja , and now I have to tell the missus . " " That shepherdess was one of her favorites . " " I know . " Ruby exchanged a look with the woman who had taken her under her wing those five years ago when Ruby and her small sister , Opal , had joined the staff at the Brandon house . Ruby had started out as a maid but , because of her love for children , had moved up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the many governesses parading through had left-or been dismissed . She was the only one who could handle twelve-year-old Miss Alicia , the eldest of the Brandon children , who was far too bright for her age . Penelope , at ten , was a willing pupil , until she and Opal got their heads together , a sure sign that mischief would soon show a face . Jason had spent much of his eight years with his nose in a book but had little regard for the demands of a teacher , unless she was presenting a topic of interest to him . Ruby knew how to charm him into being interested in anything he needed to learn , so Mr. and Mrs. Brandon had finally given up looking for a new governess . " Do n't worry , miss , she wo n't fire you , not even for that bit of fancy clay . " Mrs. Klaus , the cook , looked up from peeling potatoes , the skins curling into the bucket kept for compost in the garden . " She knows you are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wo n't think I 'm managing very well today . She caught Jason sliding down the banister . He said he was studying the properties of friction between wood and cloth at high rates of speed . " Cook coughed to cover a chuckle . Her favoritism of the eldest son was a well-documented fact . Ask any of the children who it was that always got the biggest cookie or the choice of puddings . Might as well get this over with so it is n't hanging over my head like the scimitar in the story we read this morning . Ruby dusted her hands off on her apron , raising a slight cloud of chalk dust since this was her schoolroom apron , then hung it on the hook . " Is she in her sitting room or the sunroom ? " Mrs. Klaus glanced at the carved walnut clock on the wall . " Most likely the sunroom now . She 'll be calling for tea any minute . If you want to wait and take the tray with you , might be a good time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the children to the park , so I need to get this over with . " A bell chimed three times as they spoke . " The sunroom . " Cook set a plate of lemon bars on the silver tray already waiting on the table , along with bone china cups , a pitcher of milk , a sugar bowl with tongs for the sugar cubes , and slices of lemon on another plate . Napkins lay folded on the side and teaspoons gleamed on the white damask . Three golden daffodils made a splash of color in a crystal bud vase . " Here ' t is . " Cook set the cream-toned teapot on the tray . With hands across her ample front , she studied the tray to make sure all was in perfect order . Mrs. Brandon loved to have her afternoon tea just so . But then Mrs. Brandon liked to have most things just so . She would have liked ' just so ' to have included her children , but they constantly disabused her of that notion . Ruby picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door that led from the kitchen to the butler 's pantry and thence to the walnut-paneled hall leading to the living quarters . " Is it teatime ? " Alicia , the eldest Brandon daughter , leaned over the regal carved banister and stage-whispered down to Ruby . " Yes . But is n't it Penelope 's turn today ? " Alicia shook her head and , with shoulders back , paraded down the stairs . " I traded with her . " " And who might you be this time ? " " Queen Victoria . " The girl held out a limp hand . " You may kiss my ring if you like . " Ruby rolled her eyes . " Nay , and I sha n't curtsy either . Sorry , Your Highness . Please follow me or lead the way , as you prefer . " She took a few steps and paused . " Why did Penelope agree to exchange tea days with you ? " " She was indisposed . " Again the regal tone . " Oh . " I have a feeling I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They entered the sunroom , its rich gold tones burnished by the westering sun . Pots of palms , schefflera plants , and ivy topiaries brought in touches of green , and a pudgy pot covered with waxy gardenia blossoms leant a fragrance all its own . Ruby set the tray on the low glass table in front of the rattan sofa where Mrs. Brandon leaned against the gold-and-orange-flowered cushions . " Thank you , my dear , that looks lovely . Alicia , you may pour today . Ruby , you will join us , will you not ? " Now I wo n't be able to make my announcement and a hasty retreat . Dutifully she responded in the affirmative and took the chair indicated . " Milk or lemon , Mother ? " Alicia looked up from pouring steaming tea into one of the cups . " Milk today , please , and one lump . " Alicia added the milk and a cube of sugar before passing the cup and saucer to her mother . " Thank you , well done . " Lydia Brandon , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only knotted loosely on top of her head instead of flowing in ringlets down her back , smiled at her daughter . " So , tell me , what has gone on behind my back today ? " Ruby swallowed a gulp . " Milk or lemon ? " Alicia asked with a smile for Ruby . " Lemon , please , and two lumps . " I need to be extra sweet , or I shall banish my recalcitrant sister to the attic to dine on bread and water . How she hated having to apologize for her sister 's antics . Ruby accepted her cup of tea with thanks and lifted it to her lips . Perhaps tea and cookies would sweeten Mrs. Brandon too . Or leave a mellow glow that would be dashed to smithereens like the mortally wounded shepherdess . " Lemon bar ? " Alicia waited in front of her offering the cookie plate . " Thank you . " " Now , my dears , back to my question , which you have both so assiduously avoided . " Ruby started to confess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident . " " Is she injured ? " The calm tone said this was nothing new . " N-o-o , but ... " " But ? " Mrs. Brandon watched her daughter over the rim of her cup . " But Benson , her favorite bear , is . " " And ... ? " The pause lengthened . " And Jason was conducting an experiment . " " With the bear , I take it ? " " Yes , Benson was captain of the raft that Jason built and floated on the goldfish pond . He was adding rocks for ballast and ... well ... " Her mother took another sip of tea . " And ... " " And Benson fell into the pond , and Penelope jumped in after it , and she came up all muddy with a lily pad hanging from her hair , so Nanny put her and the bear in the bath , and they had to run the water out twice . " Alicia grimaced in disgust . " She was filthy . " " I see . " Mrs. Brandon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powdered-sugar-covered bar . " And Jason ? " " Mr. Klaus said he could help clean out the goldfish pond since his experiment got Penelope in trouble . " " Very good of Mr. Klaus . " " You wo n't tell Father , will you ? " " No , Jason shall . " " Oh , he wo n't like that . " " No , but confessing one 's sins builds character . " " But building a raft was n't a sin , was it ? " " No , but putting Penelope 's favorite bear on the raft when he knew it would upset her was not an act of love , was it ? " " N-o-o . But ... " Ruby could tell that Alicia was feeling a bit confused . She nibbled her lemon bar . Was this a good time to tell Mrs. Brandon about the shepherdess ? Was n't Opal in the same fix as Jason ? " The wise man thinks ahead about the consequences of his actions . Will what he does injure someone or cause someone grief ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruby to include her in the conversation . " We must all consider our actions . The Bible says we should do to others as we would have them do to us , does it not ? " " Yes . " " An excellent precept to live by . " Ruby sucked in a lungful of air and sighed it out . " I have something to confess . " " Oh ? " Mrs. Brandon turned so she faced toward Ruby . " And what has Opal been up to now ? " Ruby knew how Jason would be feeling when he spoke to his father . " The Dresden shepherdess is no longer . " " Aah . " Mrs. Brandon closed her eyes for a moment . " My mother gave me that . " " I am so sorry . I ... I will pay for it . Can it be replaced ? " " It could be , but that is not what will help Opal to be more careful . " Lydia brought a hand up to her throat . " I think she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide what must be done . " She looked to Alicia . " When we have finished our tea , you will go tell Opal to join me in the library . " She held out her hand to forestall Ruby both in speech and action . " Enjoy your tea , and then you may take the children to the park as you had planned . I heard Bernie laugh , so I know he is up from his nap . Jason will wait on the bench in the foyer for his father to come home . Waiting , like confession , is good for the soul . " " Yes , ma'am . " * * * Opal cast a worried glance over her shoulder as Ruby ushered the others to the front door . " But , Ruby , are n't you going to wait for me ? " " No . We will be back soon . " She steeled her heart against the imploring look from her young sister . Perhaps if she had been more stern Opal would not be in this position now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ways to make them think before acting . Once out the door Penelope walked close beside Ruby . " You want me to push the pram ? " " No , I 'll do that . I thought you were going to bring your hoop . " " No fun without Jason . I wish he did n't get in trouble . " Her lower lip quivered . Alicia took her sister by the hand . " Come , I 'll push you on the swings . " They crossed the street to the park , where spring had splashed bright greens , yellows , pinks , and reds of tulips , daffodils , and primroses around the grounds . Robins dug for worms in the grass , and squirrels chattered from newly leafing branches . Ruby followed behind the two girls with the pram , then lifted Bernie out to sit on the swing with her . At two and a half he longed to run after his older brother and sisters and frequently ended up with bruises for his efforts . " More , " he squealed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifting her feet to swoop forward . She kept both arms around the ropes and her hands locked around his chubby belly to keep him from flying away from her . Penelope 's laughter reminded her how infectious was Opal 's . If Opal were here , she would be pumping as high as the sky , challenging Jason to go higher than she . Ruby leaned back and pumped enough to make Bernie squeal again in delight . " More . More . " When they finally left the swings , lights were beginning to show in the windows of houses bordering the park . " You think Papa is home now ? " " Papa home , " Bernie echoed , clapping his hands . " That might be his carriage now . " Ruby nodded toward the equipage trotting toward them as they crossed the street . " Perhaps we better go round to the back then . " Alicia took her sister 's hand . " Come , I 'll race you . " Ruby bit back her admonition that young ladies should n't be running foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumping over the crushed gravel . " A letter came for you , " Mrs. Fleish said when Ruby set Bernie down inside the kitchen door . " It 's on the hall table . " She bent down to swoop up the small child . " How 's my Bernie today ? " " Swing . Ruby , swing me high . " " Have you seen Opal ? " Ruby asked . " She 's up in the schoolroom . " Mrs. Fleish handed Bernie back to her . " Supper will be ready whenever Mr. Brandon is finished with Master Jason . I sent the girls to wash up . " " They 're not eating in the nursery tonight ? " " No . Mistress said since this was a family-only night , the three eldest would eat with them in the dining room . " " So it 's you and me , young man . " Ruby kissed Bernie 's round cheek . " And Opal . " " Nanny ? " " Her too . " Continues ... by Lauraine Snelling    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
