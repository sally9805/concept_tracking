<p> Outlining a daunting new role for American power in the new century , President Bush closed the door on diplomacy Monday and gave Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and his sons 48 hours to leave Iraq or face " military conflict commenced at a time of our choosing . " <p> With almost 250,000 U.S. soldiers massed at Iraq 's borders , Bush insisted the United States must act pre-emptively to prevent another terrorist attack on its shores . The president argued that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction , has aided terrorists , including the al Qaeda network , and poses a threat to the security of the United States and all nations . <p> " Before the day of horror can come , before it is too late to act , this danger will be removed , " Bush said , speaking from the White House to a national television audience , his voice solemn , his meaning unmistakable . <p> " The United States of America has the sovereign authority to use force in assuring its own national security , " Bush declared . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oath I have sworn , by the oath I will keep . " <p> Bush 's spoke after the U.N . Security Council broke down in mutual recriminations among pro- and anti-war factions . Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien announced that Canada would spurn any war effort , and top British minister Robin Cook resigned in protest over Prime Minister Tony Blair 's support for a war . Blair faces a rebellion in his Labor Party but is expected to prevail in a debate over military action in the House of Commons today . <p> With war imminent , U.N . Secretary General Kofi Annan ordered the withdrawal from Iraq of U.N . inspectors and other personnel in advance of hostilities , saying U.S. authorities told him " that it will be prudent not to leave our staff in the region . " <p> " Obviously it 's a disappointment and a sad day for everybody , " Annan said . " War is always a catastrophe . " <p> Bush blamed the United Nations for failing to force Hussein to disarm , dismissing critics charging that a U.S.-led invasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Nations Security Council has not lived up to its responsibilities , " Bush said . " So we will rise to ours . " <p> Criticized for his own five months of failed diplomacy , Bush countered that diplomatic efforts had failed for 12 years , since the end of the Gulf War prosecuted by his father in 1991 , when Hussein promised to disarm , and the United Nations passed more than a dozen resolutions to force him to do so . <p> ' DIPLOMACY AS A PLOY ' <p> " For more than a decade , the United States and other nations have pursued patient and honorable efforts to disarm the Iraqi regime without war , " Bush said . " We have sent hundreds of weapons inspectors to oversee the disarmament of Iraq . Our good faith has not been returned . The Iraqi regime has used diplomacy as a ploy to gain time and advantage . " <p> Bush warned Americans of a heightened possibility of terrorist attacks , and the Department of Homeland Security raised the color-coded threat level to orange , its second-highest level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as part of an intensified effort to meet the threat . <p> Bush said any terrorist attack would trigger the maximum U.S. response . <p> " Should the enemy strike our country , they would be attempting to shift our attention with panic and weaken our morale with fear , " Bush said . " In this , they would fail . No act of theirs can alter the course or shake the resolve of this country . <p> " If our enemies dare to strike us , they and all who have aided them will face fearful consequences . " <p> The president , turning his attention to the Iraqi military , asked them to give up the fight and allow U.S. and British forces peaceful entry . <p> " Your fate will depend on your actions , " Bush warned , ordering them not to destroy oil wells . " Do not obey any command to use weapons of mass destruction against anyone , including the Iraqi people . . . . War criminals will be punished . " <p> And speaking to the Iraqi people , whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bush made his case that the war was not against them , but " against the lawless men who rule your country , " and promised food , medicine and help to build a new post-Hussein nation . <p> ' MURDEROUS DICTATORS ' <p> Defending his administration 's new policy of pre-emptive attack , Bush contrasted an invasion of Iraq with European appeasement of " murderous dictators " of the last century , a clear reference to Adolf Hitler . <p> " In this century , when evil men plot chemical , biological and nuclear terror , a policy of appeasement could bring destruction of a kind never before seen on earth , " Bush said . " And responding to such enemies only after they have struck first is not self-defense . It is suicide . " <p> He promised that when Hussein is gone , the Iraqi people " can set an example to all the Middle East of a vital and peaceful and self-governing nation . " <p> Bush 's decided to speak to the nation after the United States , Britain and Spain  --  unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security Council  --  early Monday withdrew their doomed call for a second council resolution authorizing the use of force . <p> British and U.S. diplomats blamed that failure on the French threat to veto a second resolution , arguing that in any event , Resolution 1441 , which passed the Security Council unanimously in November and called for Iraq to disarm immediately , gives them ample authority to forcibly disarm Iraq . <p> " One country . . . ensured that the Security Council could not act , " charged British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw . <p> The French countered that the pro-war alliance never had a majority on the Security Council . <p> " The majority of the members of the council consider that it is not justified , it is not legitimate to authorize the use of force , " said French U.N . Ambassador Jean-Marc de la Sabliere . <p> Annan warned the United States and Britain that " if the action is to take place without the support of the council , its legitimacy will be questioned , and the support for it will be diminished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats , who vowed to back the U.S. troops , even as they faulted the administration 's failed diplomacy , while Republicans rallied around the White House . <p> " I had a different vision of use of force than the way they 're apparently going to use it , " said Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-Calif . " But once it commences , I think it 's all our duty to support our people who are in harm 's way , the men and women . . . the families that are home . My great hope in this is that we 'll avoid loss of life of our people as well as the innocent Iraqi people . " <p> Establishing democracy in Iraq " is going to be difficult , " Feinstein said . " Preventing civil war and strife is going to be very difficult . Achieving peace in the Middle East is going to be made more difficult . <p> " I could be wrong . Maybe none of that will happen . What bothers me is this president is so certain , so certain that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else knows anything . " <p> Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle , D-S.D. , who backed a congressional vote in October authorizing the use of force , Monday blasted Bush , saying he is " saddened that this president failed so miserably at diplomacy that we 're now forced to war . " <p> Administration officials said they would ask Congress as early as next week for as much as $100 billion in funding for the war and rebuilding Iraq . The administration has until now been loath to suggest figures . <p> The president did n't talk about the monetary costs of war in his speech . Rather , he focused on the cost to Americans of living in constant fear of a shadowy enemy should Hussein remain in power . <p> In very few years , " the power of Iraq to inflict harm on all free nations would be multiplied many times over , " Bush argued . " With these capabilities , Saddam Hussein and his terrorist allies could choose the moment of deadly conflict when they are strongest . We choose to meet that threat now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our skies and cities . The cause of peace requires all free nations to recognize new and undeniable realities .
