<p> " Just the best " is how Angie Dalton describes her friends at Montclair at Ridgewalk in Woodstock , an active adult community . New to Georgia , she and her husband , Richard , gave up a busy life running a bed and breakfast in California for something new here . <p> " I love to garden , and my new girlfriends tease me about how little I know about what works in Georgia , " she says . <p> It 's all good-natured fun , which is all around in the community . " We wanted an easier life , and thought we had found the best place to downsize to , but our social life has been the best surprise , " she said . <p> Montclair at Ridgewalk is just one of the many communities that have popped up in the past few years for active adults , and they 're as different as the folks who make up that group . These often are busy folks who are n't raising kids any longer . Now they 're focusing on themselves , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new chapter in their lives . <p> Montclair at Ridgewalk neighbors " started a library and get-together to talk about books , and sometimes it leads to silly girl talk and even old boyfriends , " Dalton says with a giggle . " We have a ball . " On Sunday nights , the bunco group meets for a lively time of scores and joking , and impromptu pizza and beer parties are known to pop up in the neighborhood , too . <p> Montclair at Ridgewalk was designed for low maintenance . Ranch villas with private courtyards are popular as they give residents a place to relax outside without having to look their best . And , of course , the ranch style means residents do n't have to worry about climbing upstairs in case their mobility becomes limited . <p> Some folks left big homes on big lots behind . No more weekends of mowing and pruning  --  and that 's something many are glad to check off their lists . The cost of landscaping chores is covered in homeowners ' association fees , so Dalton says she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things will look at home while they 're off on vacation . When they head out for a sea cruise , " we can just lock the door and go . We 've never had this freedom before . " <p> Of course , you ca n't spend all your time being entertained on vacation . But that 's no problem . At Montclair , " last month the social committee planned a sock hop in the clubhouse . All our events are planned around food and music , " Dalton says . " We arrange some sort of social every month . " <p> But that 's not all . From planning parties to checking on a friend in need or reserving the clubhouse for private parties , there 's a committee for everything . <p> The Montclair concept quickly caught on , and its last home was sold last year . It was time for the next place , so developer Windsong Properties kept things rolling at the new Villas at Blackberry Run in Dallas , where there are two floor plans more than you can find at Montclair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few extras , thanks to being part of the Seven Hills master-planned community , which includes a pool with water park , tennis courts and walking trails . <p> Gordon and Linda Johnson explained how they wound up at Blackberry Run . They knew they wanted everything independent living had to offer but say they initially went a little too far to find it . <p> The Johnsons left Marietta for Florida to buy in a community for folks 55 and older . The couple loved it , but they missed their four daughters , grandchildren and friends . After a few years , they came back with a different list of needs . " We wanted ' active adult ' again , but not as restricted . Now we have access to the family amen- ities at Seven Hills when our children visit , but we have this special corner of the community without small children " at Blackberry Run , she said . <p> " We sold the Florida house , moved in with one of our daughters and waited six months for the development to open , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhoods , but " there was n't anything else that tempted us . " <p> The neighborhood is close toU.S . 41 . Johnson says she shops in Hiram , Cartersville and Town Center at Cobb mall in Kennesaw . " There are changes coming , but we still have plenty of trees and a real country feeling around the development , " she says . <p> Sara and Robert Allen sold a large home after their son went to college this year , but they 're years away from retirement . They like Blackberry Run , they say , partly because lack of yardwork gives them more time for each other . <p> After owning another home , the couple knew what they wanted  --  and got it . " I like that I told the builder that I did n't want a fireplace , and he did n't make me take it , " she said . " I needed wall space and never used the fireplace I had in our other home . " Other little things brought a smile , too , like " he was great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While The Villas at Blackberry Run are in the development stage , an activities director is on hand to plan parties . Once this community is complete , residents will take over this responsibility , just like they do at Montclair . Barbara Gambino , a real estate agent representing the property , says , " We 've learned that active adults want to do this on their own , and they have very defined ideas about how to run things , so we get out of their way . " <p> ACTIVE ADULT COMMUNITIES <p> The 55-and-older crowd is searching for homes in communities where active adults can live , play and socialize with others who share their lifetime experiences . <p> Terms like aging in place , maintenance- free and stepless ranch homes are clues that the builder is conscious of needs that will change for these investors as they grow older . Ideally , you can downsize in your 50s and enjoy a home that is friendlier to your needs into your 80s . Aging in place is the new buzz term for what empty nesters are hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for levered door handles rather than doorknobs , wider doorways , hardwood and tile floors rather than carpeting . Rounded corners on counters make movement easier , too . Open floor plans give homeowners space that will allow wheelchairs and walkers room to maneuver . <p> TRACT FACTS <p> Address : The Villas at Blackberry Run , 57 Shoal Creek Way , Dallas <p> Information : 770-917-8082 <p> Price range : $190,000s-$220,000s <p> Number of homes : 78 <p> Style : Craftsman <p> Square footage : 1,750-2,100 <p> Lot size : zero lot lines <p> Standard features : two-car garage with openers ; skylight and recessed- can lighting in kitchen ; ventless gas log fireplace with granite inlay ; garden tub , separate shower ; separate vanities ; walk-in closet in master ; sidewalks . <p> Amenities : At Blackberry Run : clubhouse with fitness center , game room , gathering room , big-screen TV and fireplace .
