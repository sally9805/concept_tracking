Prologue Somewhere in the Middle ... Thursday , July 27 Hank Tobin hit bottom . Lower , Tobin thought , watching the white-bearded parkie spear a fast-food wrapper with the pointed pole and stuff it into the big , green Department of Parks garbage bag . I 've sunk past the bottom into the subbasement of hell . He shifted on the wooden park bench , gripping the pint of Stolichnaya concealed in the brown paper bag . Like a park-bench bum , he thought . He had n't had a drink , not one drop of alcohol , in four years . Had n't really been tempted . The booze had helped wreck his marriage , had clouded his thinking on the night he wrote the most reckless newspaper column of his life , had strained his relationship with his kids . But right now he was hungry for a drink . For escape . He needed something to make the pain of his son , Henry Jr. , facing life in prison go away . Tobin gripped the sealed bottle cap . Contemplated twisting it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold trigger of a pistol . He knew if he turned the cap , broke the seal of his sobriety , that this time there would be no going back . He watched a group of children in the Marine Park playground squeal through the sprinklers . He used to take Henry here as a kid , when Laurie was still in diapers . Julie would open a big picnic basket she 'd have prepared at home - cold chicken cutlets , tubs of salad , pretzels , fruit , cold lemonade , and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for the kids . They 'd all eat and toss crumbs to the birds . Then Hank and Julie would play for hours with the kids on the swings , the seesaws , the sandbox , and the sprinklers . It seemed like yesterday . And then as Tobin drew a deep , humid New York breath , it felt like two lifetimes ago . Part of another man 's sweet and happy and normal life . He cinched the vodka cap in his hand , sweating , gazing around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hand in this park with Julie when he was still courting her . Now , four years after the divorce , he was trying to summon the nerve and the precise words he would need if he ever worked up the courage to knock on Julie 's door asking for her help . If he could n't find those words or that courage , he 'd crack open the bottle of vodka . Julie lived three blocks away , but he knew he had to get the words perfect because Julie did n't suffer fools . Especially Tobin , who was the biggest fool in her life . Tobin knew that when his world tilted off its axis , when the wheels spun off his life , all the hot babes , front-page stories , boldface gossip items , best-selling books , movie deals , and A-list parties added up to nothing but a grubby mirage . It was a piss-poor substitute for a good marriage and a close family . When you need help , Tobin thought . There is only one place to go to circle the wagons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask for help . Home . But that 's if Julie will even open the door for me . The parkie put the spear and the bag into his idling Parks Department truck and grabbed a broom and a handled-shovel and approached Tobin , the peak of his army-green uniformed hat pulled low over his sunglasses , visoring the blinding morning sun . The parkie 's face was gaunt and yellowish . Tufts of white hair spilled from under the hat . He looked like a down-on-his-luck Santa with a part-time summer job . " Excuse me , fella , " said the parkie , sweeping up cigarette butts and candy wrappers from behind and under Tobin 's bench . He collected discarded newspapers , bunching them under his arm , wearing work gloves for his dirty chores . Tobin shifted on the bench to let the man do his job and said , " Sorry . " " Sorry " was the operative word for Tobin 's life now . No detox ward , rehab , or AA meeting could rescue Tobin this time . No twelve-step program could turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hank Tobin column would save his son from jail . The great Hank Tobin is powerless , neutralized , impotent , Tobin thought . Exposed as the fake I could never look in the eye in the mirror . When others offered praise , congratulations , and awards , I secretly knew that the career was held together with smoke and mirrors and bluster , like some manufactured boy band . Maybe before I became an asshole , swallowed by my own self-importance , there was a time when I was a pretty good reporter and not such a bad guy . I must 've been a decent man once . Or else a great woman like Julie Capone would never have given me a second look , never mind married me . Then she gave me two great kids . We had a special marriage . A wonderful , nutty , loving family . A helluva life . Then came The Column . And I threw away all those things that really mattered . For cheap headlines , talk shows , gossip items , fancy restaurants , deals , glamour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a suit of armor to protect myself from the truth of my own inadequacies . And as I wrote myself into a figment of my own imagination , only two people knew I was a fraud - Julie and me . So Julie filed the divorce papers , but I wrote the script . Now my son 's life is on the line and all my celebrity , fame , and connections are useless , Tobin thought . I wrecked the lives of strangers with my arrogant , self-aggrandizing , and reckless newspaper column . And instead of bringing the long overdue bill to me , the piper is making my kid pay . My son is paying for my sins . Oh ... my ... god . What did I do ? What do I do ? Where do I turn ? Who can I trust ? He tightened the grip on the vodka bottle cap as the parkie groaned , checked his watch , and sat on a bench facing Tobin , across a six-foot-wide cobblestone pathway . " Time for my five-minuter , " the parkie said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a dark silhouette to Tobin . " Scorcher . " " Yeah , " Tobin said , hiding the vodka bottle next to his leg . " At least the kids are cool , " the parkie said , nodding toward the children in the sprinkler , a rainbow arcing through the frail mist . " Kids are always cool , period . " " Used to bring mine here once upon a better time . " Tobin nodded . " Me , too . " " Ah , well , funny how things turn out later . " " I 'll say . " " When they 're this age , you think nothing 'll ever go wrong for them . " Tobin nodded , his blood screaming for booze , and said , " Oh , man ... " " You and them both figure that you 'll always just be there to protect them . " " Yeah , " Tobin said , squinting at the parkie . " You stand behind them on the swings , make sure they do n't fall , " the parkie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids on the toddler swings . " You stand under them on the monkey bars to make sure they do n't get hurt . You check the sandbox for glass and needles before you let them dig . When they come shivering out of the sprinklers , you wrap their little defenseless bodies in big warm beach towels , and hug them in your arms . You hold their tiny hands when you walk them home to make sure they 're safe . You promise yourself that if anyone ever tries to hurt your kids that you would die , surrender your very life , to save them . You would hurt anyone who ever hurt your kid . You try to be the daddy that your daddy never was to you and ... " Tobin shielded his eyes with his left hand , gripping the vodka with his right , peering at the white-haired silhouette , and said , " Hey , I know you , buddy ? " " I know from the way you look at the kids that you 're a father , " said the parkie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Kelly from his shirt pocket . Except for the hair and beard , the parkie sort of resembled the bald man in the photo . " Like me , " the parkie said , standing up . " Just another father who misses his kids . " Tobin squinted at the old parkie , whose dark wraparound shades reminded him of the wary eyes of a horsefly . A welcome rolling breeze blew in from the direction of Jamaica Bay across the flat meadow of Brooklyn 's Marine Park , sweeping between the two fathers . The parkie checked his watch , dropping some of the old newspapers . He stamped his foot on a loose front page of the New York Daily News . Tobin glanced down at the headline that was about his twenty-two-year-old son , Henry Jr. , facing twenty-five-to-life in jail for something that Tobin knew his son did n't do . Which Tobin believed was a frame-up . He was convinced the man in the photo had set up his son to get even with Tobin for a hurtful column he 'd written a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " What makes you think that ? " Tobin asked the old parkie , gripping the bottle , palming the photo . The parkie bent , grimacing in pain , and picked up the newspaper page . The man 's hat fell off his head , and Tobin thought he saw the man 's hair move as a single piece , like a loose wig . The parkie caught his hat , jammed it on his skull , and straightened the wig as he stood with a half-smile . He stared at Tobin , who saw his own distorted reflection in both lenses of the bubble sunglasses , like an out-of-body experience . The parkie balled and twisted the front page of the newspaper in a slow deliberate gesture , as if strangling someone . The parkie walked to his idling truck and climbed behind the wheel , his white wig now askew on his head . He gunned the engine and shifted the gear into drive . " Because you and me are a lot alike , " the parkie said . " So much alike that you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten years , Hank Tobin . You are going to know what it is like to have your son suffer for the sins of his father , which is the worst pain any man will ever know . " Tobin lurched toward the parkie 's truck . But the parkie hit the gas and sped off into the blazing sun . Tobin held the vodka bottle in his hand , staring at it and then at the disappearing truck . If he had any doubt before , Hank Tobin now knew more than ever that he would need to summon the courage to ask Julie to work with him to help save their only son . He did n't know if he could find that courage as he stood staring at the bottle of booze .... ( Continues ... )
