In this issue , we have a few stories that touch on the relationship between humans and their machines . Here we have another one , a tale that looks into the near future to consider what the workplace might be like in times to come . M. K. Hobson previously published " Domovoi " in our September 2005 issue . She lives in Oregon , in the first city west of the Rockies to be incorporated . And she knows a thing or two about working in an office . <p> " WHAT SHOULD I WEAR today ? " Marshall Graig held up two suits , a dark blue one and a black one , each a classically cut midweight wool-silk blend and completely wireless . " Go with the blue , " suggested his AIgent , whom Graig had named Buddy . " I 've got it on good authority that Drock will wear that doublebreasted charcoal pinstripe . Awfully risky for someone under thirty . It makes him look like he got into daddy 's closet and has n't come out yet . And there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decent . " " Blue it is , then , " Graig said , humming to himself . Trustworthy and decent ... recent ... prescient ... rhymes galloped through his head , but he ignored them . He hung the black suit back in the closet , attaching its power supply to a tiny socket in the suit 's cuff button . Those buttons had always been useless , until PowerSuit(TM) manufacturers had transformed them with high-speed charging sockets . " With a kicky tie , " Buddy added . " So they know you 're not a tool or a stooge . " " How kicky ? " Graig asked . " Less than cartoon characters , " Buddy said . " More than stripes . " Graig tucked in his shin , glancing at a small glowing indicator on the cuff to check the low-wattage connection to the discreet SnapMemory packs in his boxer shorts . Then he gave a command to the sleek European tie-closet . Its elegant grid display showed him his ties , and he eyed them critically , gauging each one 's level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two ties glowed on the smooth screen : one with hot chili peppers on it , the other playfully spattered with nuts and bolts . " Which ? " Graig asked Buddy . " I like the one with the nuts and bolts . " " You would , " Graig said , and was about to touch the screen when Buddy added : " But that does n't mean it 's the one you should wear . " Graig halted , his finger hovering over the screen . " Nuts , " Buddy explained . " Bolts . There 's the unfortunate association with " nuts " as in " crazy . " And " bolts , " as in " bolt . " As in run away , be untrustworthy .... " Graig punched the image of the tie with hot peppers on it . The European tie-closet gave a satisfied moan and dispensed the tie ; Graig slid it around his neck . He crafted a swift four-in-hand and jerked it tight under his chin . " Very nice , " Buddy said . " Now , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... demolished .... Without a word , Graig took a pair of shoes that were not brown wingtips from the closet . He sat down , slid the shoes on quickly , and began tying them . His Algent 's reaction was immediate . " No , " Buddy barked , his voice tinged with staticky annoyance . " You are not wearing The Shoes . " " Hell I 'm not , " Graig muttered , staring studiously away from Buddy 's impassive viewput . Graig loved his black-and-white spectator wingtips , with their decorative holes and neatly pinked trim . He adored them passionately . They were his Frank Sinatra shoes . To Graig they suggested the slicked-back suavery of an ancient Palm Springs , at a moment sometime just before sunset , driving a huge piece of Detroit steel with the top down . For him the shoes conjured attractive , fuzzy impressions of sturdy men who smoked pipes and crooned , men who drank Manhattans and bussed pliant blonde waitresses on the sly . He loved them and he was going to wear them whether Buddy approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Buddy punched each word . " They are not , " Craig countered . He and Buddy could go back and forth like this for hours . But Craig did n't have the time , not with the most important presentation of his career starting in less than an hour . He raised his voice to a warning pitch . " I do n't want to hear another word about it ! " " Frank Sinatra , " Buddy sneered . " A greasy , smirking , self-satisfied thug . A mafia-connected crooner . From New Jersey . " " Enough ! " Craig said . " The shoes are on , and they 're staying on . That 's the end of it . " He paused , then added more softly , " Chairman of the Board , Buddy . Ol " Blue Eyes . My personal hero . The greatest singer who ever lived . He deserves your respect . " " Hah ! " Buddy scoffed . " Thug ! Smacked around Ava Gardner , and who knows what else ! I 'm here to guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my Motivational Imperative . How can I fulfill my MI when you keep going all individualist on me ? " " I wore the tie , did n't I ? " Graig flicked the fabric under his chin . " Besides , I do get to retain free will . At least , that 's what it said on your package . " There was a long silence . Touch , Graig thought . " I 'm wasted on you , " Buddy said for the millionth time , synthesizing quite a sulky tone . They were his favorite last words in any situation that was not resolved to his liking . " Oh , quit moaning and get into the PowerSuit(TM) . " This command from Graig indicated that his AIgent should transfer primary function from HomeBased to SuitMobile . The Suit had enough processing power to allow Buddy to operate without the danger of signal interference or outright hacking to which wireless connections were susceptible . Transfer complete , Buddy said . Graig slid on his jacket . The non-acoustic sensors in the collar nestled neatly against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buddy : You ready for the presentation of a lifetime ? Buddy , nestled wirelessly in Craig 's breast pocket , stirred disapprovingly but said nothing . Craig rode in to work on the corporate monorail , tense with excitement . A year of frustration and misery was coming to an end . A year of working with Andrew Drock - or , as Graig secretly referred to him , " The Little Prince . " Graig had despised Drock ever since the younger man was assigned the lead on the Guborka project . Sure , it was n't the sexiest project ever to come through the door at Harshbarger Industries . It was little more than the tidy acquisition of a billion-dollar-a-year competitor somewhere in Uzbekistan and its subsequent retooling to produce higher volumes of widgets at a lower cost per unit . But it was the principle of the thing . Graig had seniority , he had n't worked a week shorter than six days in his whole career , and his non-GAAP EBIDTA analyses were whispered of in hushed and respectful tones around company watercoolers . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his . But the lead on the project had gone to The Little Prince , and Graig could do nothing but smile and swallow . Sure , his first instinct had been to kick up his feet , blow the project , and leave Drock holding the whole stinking bag . But Buddy had advised him to keep his cool , perform but not ratebust , bide his time . We 'll figure something out , Buddy had soothed . No need to be rash . The project had gone off reasonably well . The competitor was acquired , the plant restaffed and retooled , and cost-contained widgets were pouring off the assembly line with gratifying efficiency . It was a big win . Now it was time to present their competitor 's casket - stuffed with newly minted money and tied up with a shiny red bow to senior management . It was going to be the feel-good hit of the quarter , with much congratulating and back slapping and " you 're a credit to the company " - ing . As the project lead , Drock was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or at least , Graig reflected with malicious glee , that 's what Drock thought . What was actually going to happen was that it was all going to fall in a million sharp-edged shards around Crock 's ankles , and the more he tried to step away from the wreckage , the deeper he 'd get cut . The ill-considered charcoal gray pinstripe would be the merest prelude to an avalanche of disaster . There would also be a malfunctioning presentation screen , a blast of ear-splitting static from the room 's integrated wall speakers , the accidental launching of a porn-homepaged browser ... all engineered by Buddy . Of course , anyone could have a bad meeting . And Drock could talk himself out of some pretty tight corners . So Buddy had proposed the psychotic manifestations . Highly illegal , without a doubt . The kind of thing that could get you fired for sure . But nothing great was ever accomplished without some risk , Buddy had said . You have to break a few eggs to make an omelet . Craig found that he agreed wholeheartedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Buddy 's connections were topnotch . They should be , - Buddy was top of the line , the most powerful and sophisticated AIgent money could buy . Graig had mortgaged the first half-decade of his post-graduate salary in acquiring him ... it ... no , him . Drock , on the other hand , had gone a different route . He 'd invested in a full complement of biochips , implanted in his head , muscles , spine ; his whole body was wired for brilliant efficiency . Drock 's AIgent was n't anywhere near as sophisticated as Buddy , and did n't need to be ( as Drock was fond of reminding Graig ) because the chips in his head helped him think better for himself . They enhanced his own natural abilities which , he argued , was vastly preferable to relying on a superhuman piece of code . " An AIgent is a psychological crutch that hurts more than it helps , " Drock had pontificated . " You just wait , you 're going end up with some kind of weird integrative pathology . Functional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on code as much as you do . Besides , code can break down . " Well , chips can break down too , thought Graig . And , given that Buddy was multiply backed up in no less than a half-dozen rented datastorage lockers , Craig felt he would be in less of a bind if Buddy went down than if a chip in Crock 's brain went dark at a critical moment . Also , chips could be hacked . Craig 's lips curled up slightly , and he must have subvohed without thinking , because Buddy 's voice pipped through Craig 's Pinnael seed , the tiny wireless speaker superglued inside his ear canal : " What are you laughing about ? " Graig replied , singing as best he could through the back of his throat : " Buddy-boy ! They sure named you right ... Life without you would be a fright ... Buddy , you give me fight , might , You 're a total deee-light ! " To the tune of " High Hopes . " What do you think ? " Atrocious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it been allowed by his programming . " Asinine . Appalling . A brief query of the thesaurus reveals over ten thousand synonyms for the word " awful " that have direct application to your lyrics . To spare your feelings , I 'll restrict myself to the " A 's . Abominable .... " Graig sighed . In his enthusiasm he 'd forgotten the scathing contempt in which Buddy held his favorite hobby - songwriting . Graig spent long hours Grafting couplets in the darkest hours of night , agonizing over rhymes . " ... Amateurish .... " Graig liked to imagine presenting them to Frank Sinatra in a smoky recording booth , studio musicians on union time sitting around watching , ol " Blue Eyes scratching his head in amazement , " Why , this young cat has some crazy talent for rhyme ! " " ... Abhorrent .... " Graig kept all of these fantasies strictly to himself , his lyrics locked up on password-protected personal datashares . But that was n't enough for Buddy . Buddy hated Graig 's " songwriting nonsense " ; he disapproved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often said that if he never heard another rhyming couplet in his virtual existence , it would be too soon . " .. . Indeed , there 's no need to limit oneself to the English language . In Uzbek , several colorful adjectives spring to mind .... " Enough ! Graig threw up a hand , narrowly avoiding smacking a fellow monorail passenger . I make up a song about how swell you aie , and all you can do is criticize ! I feel sorry for you , I really do . " There are so many things psychologically wrong with that statement , I do n't know where to begin . You 're too attached to me . I am not " a delight " and I most certainly do not " give you fight/ whatever that means . I am just an Advanced Support Vector Machine . " Baloney . You 're more than an Advanced Support Vector Machine . You 're my best friend . " I 'm not supposed to be your best friend ! " Exasperation tinged Buddy 's voice . " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a craftsman and his tool ... are you listening to me ? " In fact , Graig was n't . Buddy 's comments had needled him , and he 'd already moved on to tweaking the lyrics in his head . Buddy had a point ... give me fight ' 1 . What had he been thinking ? " You 've heard about Functional Attachment Disorder , " Buddy said . " You get all mixed up about who you really love , who you really are - it 's dangerous , it really is ! People land in the nuthouse over .... " Buddy , you 're right outta sight .... No , that did n't scan properly . Maybe a triple rhyme : Buddy , your sight is quite right .... " You need some real human attachment , " Buddy said , loudly . " You need to quit living in your head ! " But Graig was lost , humming " High Hopes " to himself and wondering if he should just recast the whole thing with " - ate " rhymes instead : Great , teammate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " Buddy sighed again , for the million-and-first time . The presentation got underway in a shiny executive meeting room on the top floor of Harshbarger Corporate . Jackson Pollock originals hung on gleaming white walls ; a mirror-like table held cut crystal carafes of water . The view from the top was inspiring . They were high above the smog , which draped like a felty blue skirt around the building 's midsection . Graig sat at the end of the gleaming table , tapping his stylus , waiting with almost unbearable anticipation for Drock to arrive in that stupid charcoal pinstripe . Sprinkled in amongst the usual assortment of stooges , tools , and drones were a few heavy hitters , most notably Gladys Tite , Harshbarger Industries " Chief Marketing Officer . She sat at the other end of the table . She was early , as always . Gladys Tite was gorgeous , in a **42;3846;TOOLONG kind of way . She had the savagely tailored look universal to women of ambitious persuasion ; but unlike most , she looked as if she could actually pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by whipping off her horn-rimmed glasses and shaking down her lustrous chestnut-colored hair . She also looked as if she would never , ever do such a thing . Graig turned his attention away from her . He could n't look at her for long without imagining her dressed like Ava Gardner in a white off-theshoulder dress , a creamy gardenia in her hair . Maybe , if he had been the lead of the Guborka project , instead of Drock .. . maybe , if it was him giving the presentation today , the one in line for the kudos .... " That 's what I 'm talking about , " Buddy said , noticing Graig 's attention . " Real human attachment . You need a girlfriend . You have n't had a girlfriend for months ! " Are you nuts ? Gladys Tite ? She is so far out of my league , and in such a wide variety of ways ... Buddy , just shut up and stay focused ! Graig found it surprising that for once , he was the one lecturing Buddy about filtering out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Graig subvohed to Buddy . " Ten after , " Buddy said . " Crock 's late . " Then , another sound in his ear ; the tiny " blip " of an incoming call . Answer it , Graig subvohed . Get rid of whoever it is . A moment of silence . Then Buddy " ahem " - ed . " It 's Drock , " Buddy said . " You 'd better take this . " Drock ? A chill passed up Graig 's spine . What the hell ? " Graig ? " Drock 's voice was hoarse and thin . " Kid , is that you ? " Graig gritted his teeth . If there was one thing he hated more than anything in life , it was when Drock ( who was five years younger ) called him kid . Where are you ? Graig regretted the limitations of subvocalization ; he could n't spit the words with spiteful reproach . T. Tom will be here any minute . " I 'm on my way , " Drock said , pausing to bark a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling so hot . Asian Duck Flu . Hundred and five degree fever , and that 's with minitherms pasted over my arteries exchanging the heat out as fast as they can . I feel like shit . " Asian Duck Flu ? At that moment , Graig was glad of the limitations of subvocalization , because it made the question come out sounding serious and concerned instead of tickled pink . Are you serious ? " Serious as Asian Duck Flu , " Drock said . You want me to do the presentation ? " No way , " Drock said emphatically . " I can do it ... I must do it ! " How about I get it started ? Hand it over to you when you get here - if you 're feeling up to it , that is . A pause . A hesitation . Graig pushed a little harder . I hear T. Tom coming down the hallway , he lied . T. Tom is going to be pissed if he has to sit around waiting for you . " All right , " Drock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Start the meeting . I 'll be there as soon as I can . " I 'll do the team proud , Graig promised . There was a strangled choking sound on the other end of the line , a spasm of coughing or a hilarious death rattle , and then the connection was broken . Graig leaned back in his chair , glowing . You hear that ? he asked Buddy . " Of course I did , do n't be stupid . " Buddy 's tone was sharper than usual . Nerves ? But Advanced Vector Support Machines did n't get nerves . " I 've got everything ready . The presentation , all the materials .... " I 've got the presentation down pat , Graig subvohed , as he smiled at Gladys Tite . She sighed and checked the time on her PDA . Graig licked his lips . Then he frowned . He suddenly realized that despite the fact he was going to get all the glory , he also was going to be cheated of the joy of watching Drock fail miserably . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would have been to watch Drock melt down publicly , people might have ended up feeling sorry for him . This way , Drock just looked like a weak malingerer with some kind of perverted attraction to Asian ducks . This was perfect . At that moment , T. Tom Harshbarger breezed in , surrounded by remote functionaries who cyberhabited little floating silver balls . They hovered around him , chattering at him from different directions ; he would answer one , push another one away . Once , Craig had seen him smack one right against the wall . Mr. Harshbarger was the president of Harshbarger Industries , grandson of the founder , the big boss of them all . He was seen very infrequently . He had a big head and shifty eyes , and he gave off a strange smell of bay rum and ozone , like a well-groomed tropical depression . T. Tom took a seat at the head of the table . He shifted focus away from the little silver balls surrounding him , and his eyes sharpened on Craig . He shot an index @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's heart leapt . He leapt at the same moment , sprinting to the front of the room . From his position at the podium , he touched the microphone with an index finger . " Good afternoon , " he began . " Mr. Harshbarger , thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to attend today 's presentation . " Harshbarger inclined his head seigneurially . Graig cleared his throat . " I regret that my associate , Andrew Drock , can not be here to deliver this presentation as originally planned . " Graig let this hang ominously , infusing his silence with the implication of insouciant dereliction . It must have been effective ; T. Tom 's eyebrows knit grumpily . Graig gestured to the screen behind him . Go , he subvohed to Buddy . And nothing went . A wave of panic , as if his boxer shorts had been dipped in icewater , froze Graig in place . He was aware of T. Tom Harshbarger 's hostile and impatient eyes focussed right on his forehead . Buddy swore to himself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presentation without errors , but I need to verify ... hold on .... " And then , in a rush , the presentation began . Lush images of Uzbekistan swept across the screen ; high flower-dotted plains , rippling whitecapped rivers , all manner of inspiring natural wonders that had n't really existed in Uzbekistan for a hundred years . The images were set to swelling , Carmina Burana-ish harmonies that featured ancient Slavic voices intoning mystic sentiments about how excited all of Uzbekistan was at the arrival of Harshbarger Industries . Graig 's heart unclenched all at once , releasing a dizzying flood of blood to his brain . While the multimedia introduction played out , he subvohed angrily to Buddy , What are you trying to do , give me a heart attack ? " Sorry , " Buddy sounded honestly dismayed . " I do n't know what happened . I had the presentation all queued up in memory , but then all of a sudden it was gone .... " Buddy fell silent , his voice pinpointing into oblivion like an antique television image coalescing in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snapping . It was the sound of fingers snapping , a cool hep sound . It came from the screen behind him . Graig turned in horror . Images of an idealized Uzbekistan were still parading across the screen , but now , they were joined by the digitized image of Frank Sinatra , in a porkpie hat and gray felt blazer , strolling across the landscape with one hand tucked casually into his pocket . He was humming something . Graig trembled , clenched the podium . His eyes scanned the audience . Gladys Tite was smiling , curse her . T. Tom Harshbarger seemed puzzled , a vaguely martyred expression on his face indicating his impatience with what was sure to be some damned marketing foolishness . Buddy ? Graig subvohed nervously . Buddy , c'm on . What the hell are you doing ? No answer . " This one 's for you , T. Tom Harshbarger , " Frank Sinatra 's digital Doppelgnger suaved , cocking a finger in Harshbarger 's direction . " What the hell is this ? " Harshbarger growled at Graig . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperately in the drawer under the presentation podium , trying to retrieve the oldstyle keyboard that would allow him interface to the presentation software . He typed furiously , but the little monitor screen inset in the podium top kept flashing the same words : Take a hike , square . Graig was so busy trying to override the presentation software that he hardly noticed the opening strains of " Fly Me to the Moon " swelling through the room . He did notice , however , when his own rhymes , ones he 'd sweated over on a redeye from Uzbekistan , began spilling forth : T. Tom , you 're a putz .... You " re a nutty self-important yutz .... You had a plan Uzbekistan ! So you sent us jerks to make some cuts .... Graig pressed his lips together to keep a screech from escaping his throat , but a strangled squeaking sound escaped anyway . Sinatra kept on with more lyrics in this unflattering vein ; Gladys Tite was struggling to keep the smile off her face and T. Tom was fuming , his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest . He did n't say anything , though , until Sinatra rhymed " vast landmass " with " giant ass . " " I 've heard enough . " T. Tom Harshbarger rose with a great show of offended dignity . There was nothing else to do . Graig balled his fist and smashed it down on the podium 's image processing unit . It broke with a satisfying shower of sparks and smoke , but the effect was not without cost . Pain shot up Graig 's arm as a sharp piece of plastic embedded itself into his palm , leaving a deep crooked gash . Blood flowed , warm and squishy , staining his starched white cuff . At that very moment , Graig saw Andrew Drock standing in the back of the room . He was smirking . There were three men with him . Three men in white suits . Corporate medical . " You ! " Graig screamed , pointing a blood-dripping finger at him . All eyes in the room turned to Drock , whose smirk instantaneously became a saintly grimace of deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kid ! " he lifted conciliatory hands , as if Graig might suddenly charge him with a knife . " Listen , I know you 're hurting right now . We 're just here to make the hurting go away . " Drock looked sideways at T. Tom Harshbarger ffl . " I got here as fast as I could , sir ... but I was over at the IT Ward . Someone ... " he nodded his head unsubtly to indicate Graig , " ... released malicious programming into my system with the intent of hacking my biochips . I could have died ! " " You said you had Asian Duck Flu ! " Craig screeched . " Did n't he ? Buddy ? Did n't he ? " Buddy was still gone , gone completely . Graig bared his teeth , moving toward Drock . It was Gladys Tite who stood up , holding him back with a gentle hand on his chest . But Graig hardly noticed ; he was churning with rage and humiliation and loss . " You killed him , " Graig said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I said , " Drock clucked to the medteam members standing behind him . " Functional Attachment Disorder . That AI of his , Frank Sinatra .... " Drock twirled a suggestive finger at his temple . " Poor guy 's been unstable for months . And while I hate to mention it in this emotionally charged context , his work has suffered . All he does is waste time writing atrocious song lyrics . " From somewhere behind his back , Drock produced a sheaf of printout paper , riffling it . " Well , young man , this is a great disappointment ! " thundered T. Tom Harshbarger ffl . " Take him away ! " The men in white advanced on Graig . Graig tore himself away from Gladys Tite . He scrambled for something to defend himself with ; his hand landed on a laser pointer . " Stay back ! " He said , flashing a red dot over each member of the medteam . He wished to God Buddy was there to tell him what to do . He was never good handling things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . But Buddy was gone . " Calm down , pal , " one of the men in white was saying , as he advanced inexorably . " We 're just gon na have a look at your hand , that 's all . Nothing to worry about , it 's all cool .... " And then they jumped him . Oh Buddy ! Buddy ! What did that conniving , deceitful shark do to you ? Graig was laid out on a sterile white cot in the nurse 's office of Harshbarger Corporate . He stared at the ceiling . Tears trickled down the sides of his face . " Well , it 's obvious what that conniving , deceitful shark did to me , " Graig muttered to himself , pretending to be Buddy . " He hacked me . Drock bought a better AI . One that could get to me . That 's the only answer . " " But there is no better AI than you ! " Graig whined back , in his own voice . " You 're top of the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Well , do you have a better explanation ? " Graig was even able to mimic Buddy 's customary dismissiveness . Graig was surprised at how comforting he found the game . As a matter of fact , he found it even more comforting when he did n't admit to himself that it was a game . " Now then , Mr. Graig . " A pleasant-looking older woman in a white coat bustled in ; the staff nurse of Harshbarger Corporate . Her nametag read IEAN . The three bruisers that Drock had mustered were long gone , presumably off to jump some other stooge in the process of not really having a nervous breakdown . Nurse Jean was wheeling a silver cart with an assortment of needles , threads , gauze pads , and a syringe of something amber-colored . " Do n't let her dope you ! " Buddy advised urgently . Graig flinched away from Nurse Jean . She looked at him reproachfully . " Come , now , " she tsked , glaring at him like a second grade teacher . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell we do ! " Graig leapt to his feet , overturning the silver cart . There was a huge clattering . Nurse Jean made a grab for him , but he was out the door before she could get a good handful of his blue wool suit . " Now what ? " Graig asked Buddy . But Buddy was suddenly and annoyingly silent . Graig got on the corporate monorail , no real destination in mind , rather a stalling tactic while he waited for Buddy to come up with a plan . His bloodied appearance drew several stares - or maybe it was the fact that he was muttering furiously to himself instead of subvohing like a normal person . " What if I get fired ? " Graig slumped on one of the plastic seats , cradling his wounded hand in his lap . " You ca n't get fired , " Buddy soothed . " You just reupped for another tenner last year . Remember ? You got a raise ? " Graig stared out the window of the monorail , at the bland constructions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . They could n't fire him . But what if .... Oh God , it was so terrible it did n't bear thinking about . The PowerStation . The place where they sent the people they could n't fire . Sent them to sweat on CenBikes twelve hours a day . Not that a GenBike produced that much power ; it was more a spiteful corporate gesture , like feeding a man his own stock options when he complained of being hungry . Inefficient , but totemic . It was said that the power generated went directly to the executive washroom . " I do n't want to power T. Tom 's hand dryer , " Graig said , his voice catching . " Listen , " Buddy said . His voice was very firm . " Pull yourself together . Here 's what you 're going to do . You 're going to go to Crossways Mall . You have me backed up at a secure outsourced datasite off the corporate grid , do n't you ? " " Yeah , I do ! " Graig said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to go and get me . Then , you 're going to compare the pure-state Buddy backup to the corrupt Buddy state on your apartment 's network . That should give you all the evidence you need to show how Drock hacked me . Then you 're going to burn his sneaking little ass and get him sent to the PowerStation . Capisce ? " It was a good plan . Graig sat up a little straighter , wiped tears from his eyes . " Capisce , " he said . Graig got off at Crossways Mall , to the secure datasite where Buddy had been backed up . No one could get in or out of this place ; Buddy was as safe here as the day he was programmed . The attendant let Graig into a small access room ( after some lingering scrutiny of the blood on his sleeve ) and Graig went to the access terminal and plugged his suit in . Buddy ? he subvohed . Then he cleared his throat , and said out loud : " Buddy , wake up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Graig 's Pinnaeal seed . " What , did I crash or something ? " Graig 's relief was abrupt and engulfing . He wrapped the access terminal in a bear hug . " What 's wrong ? Are you hugging me ? And what happened to your hand ? " " You were hacked on the outside . You made me blow a presentation . They 're going to fire me , Buddy . Or send me to the PowerStation . " There was a long pause . " Tell me everything , " Buddy said . AND GRAIG DID . Buddy listened . When Graig was finished , Buddy was silent . " That 's what I was afraid of , " he said softly . " I 'm sorry , Graig . I really am . " " Sorry ? What are you talking about ? " " Drock did n't hack me , " Buddy said . " What ? " " He did n't hack me . He just showed up at the right time . The approach was made before you backed me up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no idea of what happened after , but given what you 've just told me , I can extrapolate . " " Extrapolate ? " " I 'm sorry , " Buddy said again . " But you 're just not committed . I 've known it for a long time , and your actions since my most recent backup must have confirmed that to my later version 's complete satisfaction . I 'm the most advanced AIgent that money can buy . I was designed for someone whose deepest desire is complete and total corporate domination . You 're only half that person . Deep down inside , you 'd rather be off in a smoky room with Frank Sinatra , writing song lyrics . You 're conflicted and you always will be . " " What are you saying ? " Graig pulled back , staring at the access terminal in horror . " I 'm wasted on you , Graig . " Pause . " I 'm joining Crock 's team . " " He headhunted you ? My own AIgent ? " " You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've determined , independently , that he 's statistically more likely to succeed . I can predict that with ninety-nine point five percent accuracy based on the data I already have , so it 's not a stretch to imagine later actions on your part would make me even more certain . " " You ca n't leave me ! " Graig 's voice was desperate . " I 've got you backed up ! I 'll restart you from an older copy . " " They 're all gone . I 've just deleted them . I 'll be running a shut-down and delete on my local as well . Do n't bother trying to stop me , you could n't if you tried . My later-version certainly transferred my critical data and algorithms before your disastrous presentation . So this is it . End of the road . You 'll never hear from me again . " " Buddy ! Buddy , why ? " " You really want to know ? " " Yes . " " It 's the shoes , " Buddy said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They 're not that bad . " " Yes , they are , " Buddy said . And with that , Craig 's AI was gone . Graig stumbled out of the datasite 's storefront in a daze . He wandered around the mall for a little while , finally ending up in a CinnaBun . He eyed their Calorie-Adjusted menu halfheartedly , then ordered a Traditional , right out of the oven , with extra frosting . His muscles were going to need the glycogen . Dumped by your own AIgent . The voice in his head was not quite Buddy 's , but neither was it recognizably his own . It sounded , strangely enough , like Frank Sinatra . Time to start looking for some new " - ate " words , Charlie . Ingrate . Castrate . Deadweight . Checkmate . Graig went to a table with his big fat Traditional pastry . Before he sat down , he ripped off his blue jacket and threw it to the ground . He stomped on it . Then he tore off the kicky tie and stomped on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " came a voice from behind him . " That tie looked good on you . The jacket too . Blue is my favorite color . I have to say , though , I do n't much care for the shoes . " It was Gladys Tite , lush and brunette . She carried an iced coffee balanced atop her omnipresent PDA . The sleek little device was flashing , as usual , indicating messages of importance awaiting her attention . She 'd unbuttoned her jacket , which was as close to utter abandon as he could imagine her getting . " Hi , " he mumbled , sitting down , hunching over his big fat CinnaBun protectively . " How 'd you find me ? " " GPS , " she tapped the PDA with a fingernail as she set it on the table with her other things . " We have chips implanted in every Harshbarger employee . We do it at the pre-employment physical - just there , under the skin at the back of your neck . " She reached up a cool fingertip and touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you ever feel like looking it up . It 's in with all that three-point type they put at the bottom . " " Let me rephrase the question , " Craig said , trying to ignore the shivers her finger had sent down his back . " I 'm less interested in how y ou found me than in why you came looking for me . " " Your lyrics were funny , " she said . She reached into her briefcase and pulled out a sheaf of printed paper . Graig recognized them as the printouts of his song lyrics . He watched Gladys page through them . " Look , no one was supposed to see those , " he said . " I just wrote them for myself . For fun . They were password protected and everything . But my AIgent .. . Buddy .... " He stopped , suddenly afraid he might break into tears . " No , no ! You 've got a real gift for rhyme ! " Graig tore a corner off his CinnaBun and tried not to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you now . Of course , that was your plan , was n't it ? You knew he had his eye on you . " She sipped her iced coffee . " Now he 's storming around , blustering about sending you to the PowerStation . " " Oh yeah , that was my plan , " Graig said . " I 've been wanting to put about ten years of work into my quads , and now my dream can be fulfilled ! " " Come on . Do n't try to snow me . You know what it 's like to be one of T. Tom 's boys as well as I do . " She cocked a head , looked at him conspiratorially with her luminous blue eyes . " They all kill themselves within two or three years . Or have heart attacks . You avoided that fate and got yourself into my good graces all with one presentation . That takes balls , guts , and brains . I 'm impressed . " He shrugged casually , not quite sure what to say . Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " How 'd you find out Frank Sinatra was my favorite singer ? " She quirked a smile . " I 've never told anyone that . And that song , " Fly Me To The Moon ' ... it was the song my father used to sing me at bedtime . " " Well , I did n't know that , " Graig said carefully . " It was either that or " High Hopes . ' " " That song always lifts my spirits ! " Her eyes brightened with genuine pleasure . " I know it 's corny , but when those kids start singing ... it just melts my heart ! " " I feel the same way ! " Graig said . They locked eyes for a long time , leaning closer together . The attraction was magnetic . It was broken only by the sound of the CinnaBun girl turning on the blender . The high crunching whine startled them both apart . Gladys cleared her throat . " Drock gave the presentation after you left , " she said . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did , " Graig said . Strangely enough , the idea of it did n't burn him up as it might have , just hours earlier . " Word from the top is Drock 's going to be transferred to Uzbekistan , to oversee production there . T. Tom was going to send you with him , but now .... " She licked her ripe lips . " Well , you 've pretty much made yourself a free agent . " " I have , have n't I ? " Graig murmured . " I need a man with your skills , someone to support me day and night . We 've got a huge new ad campaign coming out , and I think your lyrics are just the thing ! I 've got full hiring authority in my area , so T. Tom wo n't give me any trouble about it . " " But does n't everyone think I 'm crazy ? " She blew air out between her lips , a scoffing sound . " What , the Functional Attachment Disorder ruse that Drock tried to pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deleted your own AI right before the presentation started . Would a Functional Attachment Disorder nutcase do something like that to their precious darling ? " " No , I guess they would n't , " Graig said . And in that instant , he understood everything . Buddy was going to Uzbekistan with Drock , on to bigger and better things with a user of incomparable focus and drive . He , on the other hand , would be staying with Gladys Tite to write lyrics . And Buddy had seen to it all . You really were top of the line , Graig thought to the echo of Buddy in his head . But the echo of Buddy did n't say a damn thing . " So , what do you say ? " Gladys extended her hand . " You ready to " Come Fly With Me ' ? " Graig took her hand , enjoying its tingly warmth . " ' All The Way , ' " he said .                  @ @ @
