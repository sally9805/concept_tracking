Reviving the ' ' 60s Fashion is not alone in its championing of all things ' ' 60s . The worlds of art , design , theater , music and film are also reclaiming the decade . By William Middleton // Photographed by Peter Lindbergh Marc Jacobs might as well have issued an international news flash when he sent his models marching down the runway in punchy mini-dresses , brassy geometric wigs and shiny boots . It was some kind of cross-cultural cue , and the worlds of art , cinema , music and design could n't agree more : The ' ' 60s are back . Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor romped their way through Down With Love , while classic films from Barbarella to Blowup look fresher than ever , inspiring runway looks in New York , Paris and Milan . The art world is celebrating ' ' 60s masters and witnessing a new generation inspired by the period ; one of the era 's most important designers , Rudi Gernreich , is being reclaimed . Thanks to his muse , Peggy Moffitt , and Rei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comme des Garcons . Suddenly the freewheeling spirit of the time is everywhere . " It was a time of youth-quake , pop art and tremendous cultural change , " says Marc Jacobs of the era inspiring his collection . " We wanted to explore that ' ' 60s idea of what the future would look like-a formula involving cartoon colors and geometric shapes . I do n't even know how to use a computer . I 'm a complete Luddite , so I like the idea of the comic-book charm of what the future is supposed to be-it 's The Jetsons . " The vision of Jacobs " show owes a debt to such ' ' 60s leaders as Andre Courreges , Pierre Cardin and Gernreich , only yanked decidedly into the present . The show began with a vivid apple-red micromini , matching shoes , an ivory cashmere turtleneck and bright blue tights-the classic silhouette gone cartoon-colored . Program notes came in a futuristic typeface , but the soundtrack was by a tough , ' ' 60s-obsessed British punk band . " The music was X-Ray Spex , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world turned Day-Glo , " Jacobs points out . " And we had the models in the same wigs so they looked like clones-it all goes back to those cliches about the horror of the future , but delivered in a cartoon way . " The period has also impacted the designer 's other collections ( Louis Vuitton had the structure and shapes of ' ' 60s haute couture , while Marc by Marc Jacobs riffed on London mods as seen from the perspective of New York City 's Mudd Club in the early ' ' 80s-the time of mod 's first big revival ) . And Jacobs was only one of many who looked to the decade . Tommy Hilfiger delivered black and white A-line dresses with matching flat boots , Kenneth Cole went for two-tone minidresses with black boots , Karl Lagerfeld at Fendi sent Barbarella-worthy space suits and fabrics down the runway and Michael Kors at Celine came up with op art minis and ski bunnies in white fox fur . " I was inspired by the spirited style of model Penelope Tree and David Bailey 's graphic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing influence from the ' ' 60s because people think it was a lighthearted , careless time , " says Lagerfeld , who also incorporated mod elements into this season 's Chanel line . " It represents a new idea of a certain freedom . " A season earlier , Miuccia Prada laid the groundwork for an industry-wide obsession with the space-race era with her plastic-beaded bib necklaces , silver shoes and white minis . " I think it still inspires because it had so much energy , " says Mary Quant , the London designer who is widely credited with inventing the miniskirt and whose makeup and clothes are once again selling out of her namesake boutiques worldwide . " The ' ' 60s was a real revolution ... it was a time of such optimism . " " It just boomed , " says vintage expert Tiffany Dubin , summing up the period 's appeal . " Design was celebrated , creative people were valued , there was a sense of innocence and whimsy-the early and mid- ' ' 60s are really the ' ' 5Os but without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oversimplification of the era . " I 'm sick to death of Wallpaper* modernism , " charges Bruce Mau , the designer widely known for his collaborations with architect Rem Koolhaas . " The ' ' 60s was one of the most unstable and dynamic periods of recent history . From marriage and family to work and government to fashion and design , social institutions were subjected to radical reconsideration . That these ambitions and sensibilities might be taken up again today , that the project of freedom itself might be " influential " is much more exciting than any marketing trend . That is precisely why interest in the period is emerging now . " New York 's most exciting new hotel , the Maritime , just opened in a startling tower of white ceramic tiles and porthole windows that was built in 1966 . Norman Foster 's new Chesa Futura in St. Moritz looks like it was designed for the same era . The famed L.A.-area Case Study Houses of the ' ' 60s will soon have modern-day counterparts with the much anticipated architectural laboratory the Houses at Sagaponac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with ' ' 60s architectural references ; in New York City 's Meatpacking District , Brazilian designer Carlos Miele has opened a retro-futuristic flagship store . " What I call pop and radical design is definitely very hot right now , " says James Zemaitis , a senior vice president at Sotheby 's . " The previous decade , midcentury modern , is almost a cliche . The ' ' 60s is the future of design auctions . " Zemaitis points out that two of today 's most exciting furniture and product designers , Marc Newson and Karim Rashid , are inspired by the ' ' 60s use of color , material and playful forms . Much of the original design from the period is also still in production . " The products were utopian , " notes Murray Moss , whose SoHo shop Moss offers some of the best work from the era . " That kind of optimism remains appealing . People in their twenties and early thirties are seeing them for the first time , and they are viewed not as retro but as valid proposals for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the era . Some recent standout exhibitions feature artists from the decade : op art pioneer Bridget Riley has a retrospective at Tate Britain until the end of the month , with a companion book having just been released ; the Metropolitan Museum of Art is using its Roof Garden to exhibit six of Roy Lichtenstein 's painted bronze and aluminum sculptures ; in Queens , the film installation Andy Warhol : Screen Tests has just wrapped up at the Museum of Modern Art ; and Factory Made : Warhol and the Sixties , a book by Steven Watson , is being published in October . The art of the ' ' 60s is having a marked effect on the new generation as well . The most influential force is pop art , which has affected Damien Hirst , Jeff Koons and Japanese artist Takashi Murakami ( whose cartoon designs on Louis Vuitton handbags have caused a sensation ) . Gallery owner Jeffrey Deitch is effusive about the big names of the ' ' 60s . " They are the American equivalent of the Italian artists of the Renaissance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is showing a ' ' 60s-inspired show of contemporary work called Popstraction next April . " The decade represents a fusion of art , music , fashion and design . That 's the great cultural achievement of the ' ' 60s : putting all these forms of creativity into one coherent statement that crosses all media . " In Hollywood , ' ' 60s sunniness has been lighting up many recent films . In addition to the new take on Rock Hudson and Doris Day 's romantic comedies by McGregor and Zellweger , Steven Spielberg and Leonardo DiCaprio teamed up in the stylish Catch Me If You Can and Roman Coppola 's first film , CQ , was a retro-futurist fantasy starring model Angela Lindvall . In October , Bernardo Bertolucci comes out with The Dreamers , set in Paris during the 1968 student riots ; Bill Paxton is starring in a live-action remake of the cult classic TV series Thunderbirds ; and Drew Barrymore has been talking about producing ( and possibly starring in ) a Barbarella remake . At the same time , the original work of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Cannes Film Festival featured an extensive Federico Fellini retrospective , and every fashion designer inspired by the era can rattle off scores of important ' ' 60s films : Among those most frequently mentioned are William Klein 's fashion-world satire Qui etes-vous , Polly Maggoo ? , as well as Blowup , The Graduate , Valley of the Dolls , Belle de Jour , The Thomas Crown Affair , Barbarella and The 10th Victim ( a little-known Italian thriller that is a favorite of Tom Ford ) . The two biggest productions on Broadway this year also recreate the era-in very different ways . Nine , inspired by the Fellini film 8 1/2 , captures the European sleekness of the early ' ' 60s , while Hairspray looks at the too-much-is-never-enough excess of 1962 Baltimore . On the music scene , some of the hottest stars of the moment are clearly connected to the 1960s . For groups like the White Stripes , the Yeah Yeah Yeahs , the Hives and Grandaddy , the authenticity of the time is a reaction against the blandness of processed pop . Meanwhile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovate . On Marianne Faithfull 's most recent album , Kissin Time , she teamed up with current musicians Beck , Jarvis Cocker , Billy Corgan , Dave Stewart and Blur . Another factor in the fascination with all things ' ' 60s is postmodernism-why limit yourself to one era when you can have them all ? " I know sophisticated musicians working on very advanced computers who also have enormous collections of vintage records , " notes Jacobs , who could easily be describing someone like himself . " They scour the world to find things on vinyl . Younger generations want to move forward but also have this desire for what came before . Now , the two just go hand in hand .
