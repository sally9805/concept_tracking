Guitar manufacturers have long used women to hawk their wares  --  but often as bosomy ad models clutching Flying V 's in manicured hands . Now there 's a slow change afoot , even though female buyers still account for only about 5% of guitar sales . Last year Tish Ciravalo , a bass guitar-playing mother of two girls , founded DAISY ROCK GIRL GUITARS , a company that designs instruments for the female player . The Daisy Rock axes have thinner necks and smaller , easy-to-hold bodies in such unapologetically girlie shapes as hearts and daisies  --  see left . Starting at $239 ( including purple gig bag ) , the guitars are selling at a pace of several hundred a month . Traditional guitar companies , meanwhile , have begun to market signature lines for female artists . Whether the chance to rock like Melissa or Sheryl will inspire more girls to play is n't clear yet . But selling guitars today is no longer about manicures . It 's about hard-earned calluses . <P>  --  By Rebecca Winters <P> SHAWN COLVIN Grammy-winning folkie Colvin first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vintage Martin acoustic throughout her career .
