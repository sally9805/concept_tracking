Two early-summer jaunts on opposite sides of the country // WHY HERE , WHY NOW : You want to ride in Vermont . You should ride in Vermont . But this weekend the haul from your Tri-State home all the way to East Burke ( 72 Hours , Winter ' 04 ) is just too daunting . And besides , New Paltz is closer and offers plenty of trail-riding challenges and a friendly , unpretentious vibe . DIRT : The best technical terrain is a half-hour drive north of town , outside Kingston at Jockey Hill . Jockey is n't huge , but the riding here is hugely challenging , with stretches that demand-at turns-power , finesse , balance , agility and brute determination . No trail is much longer than a mile , but you could ride Jockey for an entire season and not get bored . Park at the edge of Woods Road ( get driving directions and maps from the MTB Trails section of gunks.com ) , then pedal out onto the wide doubletrack . Your adventure should commence on Kneecap . This short warm-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibe of Jockey . Our other favorite trails include : Groove , which is relatively smooth , with a nice flow through tight trees and over logs ; Skull , which requires focus and balance and quick bursts of power ; Mushroom , a trail that swerves and whips through narrow corridors of trees , rolling up and then gently down , allowing you to really rocket ( but be careful ; there 's always stray rock or log leaps when you least expect them ) ; and Close to the Edge , an aptly named test-piece that requires supreme attention , balance and a healthy sense of humor . If you ca n't laugh at the folly of trying to clean this one , you 're gon na cry . If you want veteran guides for your Jockey initiation , get in touch with the folks at Fats in the Cats ( fatsinthecats.com ) , who hold regular weekday jaunts . Closer to New Paltz is the Mohonk Preserve . This park is legendary among rock climbers and hikers , and it 's what people mean when they say they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Shawangunk cliff band that stretches for 50 miles in a roughly north-south direction parallel to the Hudson River . There are more than 50 miles of climbing , meandering and sometimes fairly challenging doubletrack at Mohonk and in adjacent Minnewaska State Park . We heartily recommend skipping both on weekends because you 'll be dodging baby carriages and hikers . On weekdays , however , pick up a $9 day pass and a map at the Visitor Center off Route 44/55 ( get driving directions at mohonkpreserve.org ) and head to the parking lot at Spring Farm off Mountain Rest Rd . From there , take the Blue Trail to the Red Trail , then connect with the stout doubletrack climb on Cedar Drive . This eventually crosses Mohonk Road ( watch for traffic ) , then twists in a fun downhill to connect with Mossy Brook . Take the latter to the fast , semi-technical Laurel Ledge trail . This joins Overcliff , which returns you on a long , scenic lasso-loop big-ring run to Laurel Ledge and the eventual climb and descent to Spring Farm . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills or your heart rate terribly , but is beautiful , especially on deserted weekdays . SHOP : Table Rock Tours and Bicycles ( 292 Main St , Rosendale ; 845/658-7832 ) is a great place to go for repairs , parts and trail advice . They sell Jamis , Santa Cruz and Litespeed ( they also rent from a fleet of trailworthy iron ) . Owner Tom LaFera has a ridiculous store of bicycle know-how and will dole it out by the truckload . Shut him up by offering to buy something and he 'll reward you with secret locals-only trail beta . The sharpest shop by far in New Paltz proper is Bicycle Depot ( 15 Main St ; 845/255-3859 ) . Owner Danny Brennan stocks Giant , Gary Fisher and Cannondale rigs , and has the expertise to fix anything with bicycle wheels . GRUB : If you want fancy , hit Beso ( 46 Main St. ; 845/255-1426 ) , the best joint in town . Entres are n't cheap ( $15-$25 ) , but they are splendid ; staples include braised short ribs and mushroom risot-to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetarian shepherd 's pie . Speaking of things organic , do n't miss a trip to Suruchi ( 5 Church St. ; 845/255-2772 ) , a no-meat Indian bote where practically everything is made fresh daily and the food is superb and reasonably priced . Start with the tomato-coconut soup , get some dosas , then go with the Chana Masala , Palak Paneer , Aloo Gobi , or any of the assorted spicy treats . For beer , skip the mediocre Gilded Otter brewpub and instead hit Bacchus ( 4 South Chestnut ; 845/255-8636 ) and select from more than 300 quaffs . To caffeinate , try The Bakery ( 133 North Front St. ; 845/255-8840 ) , the locals ' spot for cappuccino and bagels . CRASH : For a cheap squat , share a room at the New Paltz Hostel ( 145 Main St. ; 845/255-6676 , newpaltzhostel.com ) for a mere $25 a night . This includes free Internet , shower , and even free eggs and milk at breakfast ( but you need to cook for yourself , fella ) . There 's free camping just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend it ; unruly rock climbers tend to have the run of " Camp Slime " ( on Rt . 299 just shy of the intersection with Rt . 44/55 ) , and there have been bear sightings . The best digs for cyclists are at Clove Cottages ( 200 Rock Hill Rd. , High Falls ; 845/687-4170 , clovecottages. com ) . You and a pal ( or three ) can rent a cottage ( starting at $110/ night ) , nosh on fresh-baked scones in the morning and use the convenient bike wash . You 're even within a warm-up pedal of local trails at Mohonk. - Michael Frank Sidebar The riding is fairly mellow but fun near Duck Pond on the Mohonk Preserve near New Paltz . From your Tri-State home , New Paltz is not only closer than Vermont , but it also offers plenty of trail-riding challenges and a friendly , unpretentious vibe . The mountains around Missoula , Montana , shed their snow in early summer , when wildflowers burst from the trailsides and the single-track is at its tacky best . // <p>   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
