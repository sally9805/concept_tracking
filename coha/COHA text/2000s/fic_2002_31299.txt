Chapter One : The Book of Mary Fred When Little Freddie took sick , I knew things would change , and change fast . We sat next to his bed all day , laying our hands on him and saying the Beautiful Prayer , but he just got hotter to the touch and more shivery . His skin looked yellow , like he was turning into old paper . I laid my hand on his forehead and said " Get thee hence " a bunch of times , but it did n't help . That night I had a dream that the Archangel Willie came to me and said , " Lo , Mary Fred , thou wilt be traveling down the road . Thou wilt be somewheres else when the Big Cat comes . So look to yourself and say Ho . " When I woke up , I said Ho a bunch of times . Then I went to see Little Freddie , but he was already gone . Mama and Papa wanted to take his body down to the Compound , but the people from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an all topsy . I wish I could say I had never seen Papa so mad , but the truth is he had been that mad before . " My temper is my trial , " he always used to say , but sometimes I thought he was right to get so steamed , especially the past year when the same thing happened down at the Compound with my other brother , Fred . " My children belong to the One , not you people , " he yelled at the man from the Coroner 's office as they took Fred away in a black bag . We all stood there crying as they drove away with him . After a few days , they brought him back and said we could bury him , so we had a nice funeral in the Compound cemetery . The Reverend Smith did the service and it sounded real peaceful . I liked when he said Fred was up in the World Beyond with all the angels dancing around him in a heavenly circle . He made it sound so good I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went onward , I did n't feel as bad as I might have . I was getting used to these things , and I figured he 'd be happier where he was . The only bad thing was we could n't bury him with Fred , we had to bury him up at the Outpost , and not as many people were at the funeral , and the Reverend Thigpen was n't as jolly and nice as the Reverend Smith . He talked about the mountains covered with snow , and I wished Little Freddie had taken a coat with him because it sounded mighty cold up there . After the service , we had some sandwiches in the main hall , and then we went back to our cabin to wait . Papa said he knew it would only be a matter of time , and he was right . It took two days for the County to come out to see us . Mama had cleaned up the cabin as best as she could . She made up Little Freddie 's bed real nice , and the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I swept out the kitchen and the bathroom , which got a lot of spiders in them generally , and I raked the leaves out front so the grass looked clean and orderly . I raked really hard because I knew something would happen , and I was hoping to make it go as easy with all of us as possible . The Book says that the One told us to sow lots of grass , because grass is the word of the sower . That 's why we planted so much , because it spread the Good News more quickly . But it was a dry June , and the grass was dying all across the Outpost . That 's how I knew . The woman who drove me away said her name was Diane . She seemed like a nice enough lady , so I went with her without crying , or trying to run away , like my younger brothers and sisters were doing . We all went in different cars because we were going to different places , and all of them were hanging out the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't even there . They 'd taken her and Papa away in a police van , but the little ones did n't know that . I kept them inside when she left . I was the only Big now , since Fred went home to the World Beyond , and sometimes it was hard being the only one who understood what was going on . I had been the middle one of the Bigs , between Fred and Little Freddie , and then there were the four Littles . Mama and Papa always said we were their stairsteps . There was a step missing between Little Freddie and me , a baby who had died . Diane kept talking to me about stuff outside the window . She 'd say things like " Look at the cows , " and I 'd look and say the cows were nice , though personally I liked pigs better because they were smarter . " Did you learn all about animals in school ? " she asked me . I said of course not , I had learned about them from feeding them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to school in some time , not since we 'd left the Compound . " Would you like to go to school ? " she asked . She had a way of asking questions with this bright face that made you want to give her the right answer just to keep her from busting out crying . So I said yes , even though I did n't want to go to school . I wanted to go back to the Outpost , but since I knew Mama and Papa were going to be gone for a while , my second choice was the Compound . I knew that was n't going to happen , so I decided to travel hopefully in the One . I watched Diane as she drove . She had gray and black hair standing like wires all around her head , and red marks in the corners of her mouth . Her skin was spotty , and her eyes were squinting through her glasses while she watched the road . As we drove , the road got bigger and more full of cars and trucks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could see rows of little houses in lines , and all the green began to disappear . I thought of asking her where we were going , but it did n't matter that much to me . I knew that wherever it was , Mama and Papa would n't be there , and I would dwell among Lackers , like the Book said not to , and the Littles would be somewhere else , wondering where we all were and needing us . The thought made me want to cry , but I just stared really hard out the window and pretended I was running down one of the city streets , then flying up to the World Beyond , and in a while I felt a bit better . After about an hour of driving , Diane got off at an exit and drove to a square building . We went up in an elevator . She asked if I wanted to push the button , and I did . When the doors opened , we went down a wide hallway to some glass doors that said County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the one the Outpost was in . Both the Outpost and the Compound were in Frederick County , only they were two different Frederick Counties . The Reverend Smith always said that was no accident , that the counties had been waiting for the blessing of our Coming , and when we had come , we had fulfilled the prophecy of the county fathers . This county was not a Frederick , but that did n't surprise me . I was ready to spend some time with Lackers . It had happened once before , when I was small . We got taken into custody because Papa was brought in for illegal possession of firearms , and it took a few weeks for us to get home to Mama . That was in Tennessee , before the Compound was located . We always say it was located , not found , because as far as we 're concerned , the Compound was always there , we just did n't happen to be there with it . I had been to school with Lackers , back at the Compound , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we left them alone , and most of the time we all got along just fine . Every so often one of them would beat up one of my brothers , or one of my brothers would beat up one of them usually for saying something about our clothes . We always had to wear something brown , since brown is the color of prophecy , and sometimes people said mean things about that . But most of the time even the Lackers knew that the Big Cat was coming , and coming soon , and they seemed to want to stay on our good side just in case we turned out to be right about everything else . I sat in a chair next to Diane 's desk while she filled out forms . One form after another , she wrote and wrote , asking me questions every now and then . Did I wear glasses ? No . How old would I be on my next birthday ? Sixteen . Did I have any food allergies ? No , but I did n't like beets . Had I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , German measles , and mumps , and the One had seen me through all of them just fine , thank you for asking . What grade was I in ? I would have been in tenth this year if we 'd stayed at the Compound . Fred would have been in twelfth , and Little Freddie in seventh . She did n't ask me about them , but I thought that . I thought about them a lot and wondered how they liked it where they were . " You 'll have to stay at the shelter for a day or two , until this all gets processed , " Diane said . " Thank you , Miss Diane , " I said . I was pretty good with my please-and-thank-yous . You never knew when you 'd need them . " Just call me Diane , " she said . " I do n't think I can , " I said . " Mama always says that adults are your olders and betters . I 'd feel funny calling you just Diane . " " Try , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my best . Diane . " It sounded odd to me , but then , I knew that a lot of things would be odd from now on . The shelter was called the House of Ruth , which made me feel right at home since I know that Ruth was someone in the Old Book . We did n't read the Old Book , just the New , but still , I felt right at home with folks who were in it . I never did meet anyone named Ruth , but there were some nice enough women and kids in there . Some of them had brown skin , which took some getting used to , but we were always taught that brown was a gift from Above , so we did n't mind it . They gave me a stuffed dog to sleep with the first night there . We had never had any toys like that , since Papa said they were craven images , but when I tried to go to sleep , I found myself petting the dog and thinking about Little Freddie . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sisters , and throwing stones at cans in the woods . The hair at the back of his head would n't lay flat , and we were always licking our hands and patting his head to get it to stay down . His hair was soft and straight , and he smelled like boys do , of sweat and dirt and the air . I felt the smell of him , and as I breathed in , something caught in my chest , and I put my arms around the stuffed dog and held him while I tried to sleep . All night long , I dreamed I was home , at the dinner table with my whole family , but then sometimes when I 'd look at Fred , or Little Freddie , they would seem to be disappearing , turning all filmy and see-through like veils . I 'd try to call out to them , but the words would stick in my throat , and once I woke myself up trying to shout . It was hard to get back to sleep after that , but finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window and woke me , and I knew it was the light of the One telling me to get up and get cracking . I jumped up and put on my clothes . Some of the little kids in the room were still sleeping , so I dressed real quietly , then went downstairs to wait for Diane . One of the volunteers made me some oatmeal , and I ate it , though I do n't like oatmeal in summer and it was already hot out , not really an oatmeal kind of day . By the time Diane came at ten o'clock , the little kids were up and watching TV , and one of them was jumping up and down on the sofa but nobody seemed to mind . Diane came and filled out some paperwork while I tried to shush everyone , and then we got back into her car and drove some more . I was just as glad to get away from the children , since being with them was making me think about the Littles and wonder where they were and if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in Diane 's car , since we did n't ride in cars at all back at the Compound , though at the Outpost we did it a lot more since stuff was more spread out and the town was nearby . I liked looking out the window , so I watched the road as it got wider and busier still , and then we turned off the highway onto a street and went past a bunch of apartments . Kids were playing outside , and though they were brown , mostly , they reminded me of Little Freddie . Everywhere I looked , I saw little boys playing with their sisters , throwing balls to them , chasing them down the street and laughing . After a while , the streets got more winding and narrow , and they were lined with houses , the kind of houses with porches and flowers climbing up the side of them . Some of the flowers were big and bushy , with wild purple blossoms , as if no one had ever trimmed them . The houses were n't the new kind you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny angles and peeling paint . I knew that the Book said something about flowers , but I could n't think of what it was . " The flower falleth , but the proverbs of Fred endureth forever . " Something like that . It worried me that I had forgotten . We pulled up in front of a pink house with purple trim that looked like it had just been painted . The pink was the color of rare meat , and looking at it made me a little queasy . As we were driving , Diane had explained to me that I was going to stay with a foster family , the Cullisons , for a while , and that I would like it there . She said they were a nice family and that they would take good care of me . I asked if all my brothers and sisters were going to nice foster families too , and she said yes . So I tried to make myself feel relieved about that , but I did n't I felt jittery and out of sorts . We walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung it open , it leaned sideways on its hinges . Papa would have hammered a few nails in it right away , but he was n't there , of course , so we just walked right in and up some steps . The steps had been newly painted purple too , and they were a little bit sticky . The front door was heavy and wooden , and it had a piece of glass in it with little diamond-shapes around the edges . Through the glass , I could see someone approaching . Her eyes seemed to widen , and then she threw the door open and stood there smiling at me but in a nervous kind of way , like someone seeing a skunk on the path on their way back from the well . " Mary Fred , this is Alice Cullison . She 's going to be taking care of you for a while . " " Pleased to meet you , Mrs. Cullison . " " Oh , " Alice Cullison said . She had straggly graying brown hair , pulled back in a ponytail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray-blue . Her cheeks got a little bit red , and she said , " Oh , not Mrs. , dear . Could you just call me Alice , please ? " I knew better than to argue , having gone that round with Diane . " Sure , Alice . " I felt all smart-alecky saying it , and I grinned a little . " Come in , come in , " Alice said , smacking herself on the side of the head with her hand like she 'd forgotten something . " It 's so hot out already today , is n't it ? I 'm sorry we do n't have air-conditioning , Mary Fred , but it 's cool in your room . I put a fan in there , and it works pretty well . It sort of sucks the air in from the window and stirs things up . " We walked into a small , dark sitting room with some old faded sofas in it . The sofas had blankets thrown over them but you could still see that their arms were worn out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seen another living soul in a week . " Would you like some lemonade ? It 's just Country Time but I made a whole pitcher of it . Of course , it has aspartame in it and Mary Fred , you do n't have a seizure disorder or anything , do you ? I hate aspartame , but Heather likes it so I always Diane , can I get you something ? Mary Fred ? " " Yes , ma'am , I 'd like a lemonade please , and thank you . " Alice gave Diane a funny look , like she was panicking and needed help in the kitchen , but Diane sat down on the sofa and motioned for me to do the same . " Do you have any questions for me , Mary Fred ? " " No , ma'am . Diane . " " Do n't you want to know something about the Cullisons ? " " Not really , ma'am . I 'm sure I 'll find out soon enough . " The truth was , I knew the Cullisons were Lackers I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no brown in sight , nor an ark , nor the Holy Books . All Lackers were pretty much the same to me . Some were nice and some were n't , and it did n't matter because where I was going , none of them were going to be there anyway , and the time was coming for the Big Cat , and coming soon . It was already 1999 , and the signs were manifold . That was what Papa always said , " manifold , " which was also part of a car engine , he said . I could tell Diane wanted me to ask a question , though , so I said , " Well , Diane , how long do you think I 'll be here ? " " It 's hard to say , Mary Fred . " Diane looked at me like this was not the question she was hoping for . " It depends . " " What does it depend on ? " I asked in spite of myself , though we were always taught that it 's not polite to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , there 's the trial . Both trials , actually . And then after that , it 's impossible to say . " " To say what ? " I could n't believe my impertinence , asking her a third question . The Reverend Thigpen would have said that I was being presumptive and told Mama and Papa about it , then I would have gotten a beating . But Diane did n't seem to think it was odd , though I could tell she did n't like this question any better than the last one . " It 's hard to say if they 'll be convicted and if so , how much time they 'll have to serve . " " Well , our lives are service , " I said cheerfully . " I mean , in jail , " Diane said , biting her lip . " It depends on what the judge says . " " I know , " I said , trying to make it easier for Diane , though I was getting a knot in my stomach . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know , " Diane said , looking at me . Her eyes looked so sad behind her glasses that I wanted to say something to comfort her . " I 'm sure I 'll like it here , " I said . " I 'm sure it will be just fine . " " Here 's your lemonade . " Alice came through the kitchen door carrying a tray with three different-sized glasses on it . " The big one is for you , Mary Fred , " she said , stooping in front of me . I had never seen an adult serve a child before , and certainly not from a tray , and I felt funny taking the big glass , but I did . I waited for her to give Diane her lemonade and to sit down , and then I took a sip of mine . It tasted like old sweat , but I drank it all down fast so I did n't notice it . I decided to get me a bunch of lemons and some sugar sometime soon and show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd be here for a while , so I figured I 'd get a chance . " Alice , why do n't you tell Mary Fred something about your family ? " Diane said , waving her hand in the air like she was trying to swat a fly . " Oh , okay ! " Alice brightened up and pressed the palms of her hands together . " Well , Mary Fred , it 's me , and my daughter Heather , and my brother Roy . We 've lived in this house for about thirteen years , since Heather was two . " " Heather is just your age , " Diane added , in case I could n't do the arithmetic for myself . " I work in the library at the college near here . Heather just finished the tenth grade , and she 'll be going into eleventh next year . " I waited for her to tell me what Roy did , but she did n't . I also wondered where Heather 's father was , and how you could call one woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought about my own family , the seven of us kids , and Mama and Papa at the dinner table , all of us saying the Beautiful Prayer together . But of course two places at the table were empty when I tried to imagine it , and that just made me feel worse and more confused . For a moment I felt like crying , and I wished I 'd been able to bring the stuffed dog with me from the shelter . I 'd gotten kind of attached to him . " Would you like to see your room , Mary Fred ? " Diane asked . It seemed like Diane was the only one who knew what to do . Alice jumped to her feet like she was about to dance , and started up the stairs . I followed her . The stairs were made of scuffed wood , and they twisted up onto a small , dark landing . Alice flipped a light on and I could see five wooden doorways . One had a flowered name tag on it that said " Heather " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmade bed , a bunch of stuffed animals , and a lot of clothes on the floor . Two doors were closed , but the third was open , and I could see a bathroom . Alice opened the fifth door wide so I could look in . There was a bed with a flowered bedspread and a big piece of the same flowered fabric across the window . It did n't look like any curtains I had ever seen . " This is your room , Mary Fred , " Alice said , waving me in . " It used to be the guest room , but I fixed it up a little and tried to make it look more , well , feminine . " Diane gave her a disapproving look that I pretended not to notice . We went into the room . It was all nice and neat , and a little fan was blowing as hard as it could next to the open window . Through the window , framed by the flowery fabric , I could see a big oak tree . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made a plan to stand under it for a while in case the One wanted to send me a prophecy , or maybe just some idea of what was going to happen now . " It 's very nice , " I said to Alice , who smiled and looked pleased altogether . " It 's a fancy room . " It was just the kind of fanciness Lackers seemed to like , so I figured I ought to say that . " You can put your things down , Mary Fred , " Diane said . I was carrying my overnight bag . I put it down on the bed . " Why do n't you get unpacked , and maybe you 'd like to wash up , " Diane said . I knew it would only take me about two minutes to unpack , but I said I would , and they left me there . I opened my suitcase and started taking things out . I had brought my two best dresses , in case we went to church , though last time I 'd been with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hang them up and sure enough , there were a bunch of plastic hangers in the closet . The closet was big enough for another twenty dresses or so , but needless to say I did n't have them . I had a pair of brown dungarees for working in the garden , in case there was a garden , and I folded those up and put them in a drawer in the dresser next to my bed , along with five pairs of cotton underpants . Next to them , I put my stripy yellow and brown shirt , the one that Fred used to say made me look like a skinny little bumblebee . " A bee in the body of a lion , " Mama would add , smacking Fred for making fun of me . I would make a loud buzzing sound and swoop down on all the Littles like I was going to sting them , and they would scream and run away , laughing . It would be a hot day , like this one , and we 'd all be out in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hose . I put my hands over my ears because all I could hear was laughing in my mind and then the terrible silence of this house , with nothing but the fan humming . I sat there for a moment , still holding my ears and shaking my head to get the fan sound out of it . Then I made myself get up and close the dresser drawer , and I looked for somewhere to put the toiletries that I had in a small plastic bag . I did n't want to leave them in the bathroom in case they were in anybody 's way , so I put them down on the nightstand . I put The Book of Fred right down next to them , but that seemed kind of disrespectful , so I put the plastic bag on the floor . Then I noticed a little bookshelf next to the window , so I put my book there , squeezed in between a bunch of what looked like picture books . On top of the bookshelf was a plastic pony with long , braided , wavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought to myself . We used to braid our horses ' manes sometimes , but of course they were never pink . I had to admit , though , that the plastic pony looked awfully pretty that way . When I had unpacked everything , I slid my overnight bag under the bed and sat down on the comforter for a while with my hands in my lap . I figured that Diane and Alice might have needed to talk about me some , so I gave them a little time . Then I went out on the landing and found the bathroom , and I splashed some cold water on my face and washed my hands . I said to myself , " The water of life is bright as crystal , " and then , " Blessed is the one who keepeth the words of the prophecy of the Book . " I looked at myself in the mirror and said , " Amen . " I was n't used to mirrors , since Mama did n't believe in them , and my face always looked like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mirror anyway , and gave her a little wink . Diane and Alice were sitting on the sofas talking when I came downstairs . I was sure they had been talking about me before , but now they were on the weather and how hot it was , and Alice was saying that she really wished she could afford air-conditioning but it was just one of the many things , something or other , and she mentioned some man 's name and looked sad . Diane looked bristly , and her wiry hair seemed to pick up an electrical charge and quiver , but she did n't say anything , just shook her head and stood up . " Mary Fred , I 'll be leaving now . Is there anything you need to ask us ? " I thought for a minute . " What are my chores ? " Diane and Alice both laughed , like this was funny . " Oh , Mary Fred , " Alice said , touching me lightly on the arm , " it 's not like we want you to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you 're part of the family . " I said I figured that anyone who was part of a family had chores . They laughed some more , so I gave up and asked about school . Diane told me that school was just about over so I did n't have to worry about it until fall , but that they would try to get a tutor for me over the summer so I could catch up with my grade . " Heather can help you , " Alice said , though Diane looked at her funny , like she thought that was n't likely . " Is Heather at school right now ? " I asked . " I hope so , " Alice said . " I mean , yes . " " Well , Mary Fred , I 'd better be off . Welcome to your new home . I know you 'll like it here . " Diane gave me a little pat on the arm , and then handed me a card . " Call me if you have any more questions , or if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will , ma'am , " I said , putting the card in the pocket of my dress . Diane smiled at me and said , " I 'll talk to you later , " to Alice . She went out the door , pulling it shut behind her . The air whooshed around us as the door closed . Alice turned to me , smiled brightly , and said , " Are you hungry ? " " Not really , ma'am . Alice . But thank you . " " Would you like to go lie down for a while ? " " No thanks . I 'm not really tired . " " Would you like to watch some TV ? " " Oh , no , ma'am . " I did n't want to explain that only Lackers watched television , that we would never , ever poison our brains like that . That would have been a rude thing to say , so I just said , " I do n't care for TV , thank you . " Alice looked like she had no idea what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " Why do n't I bake something for dinnertime ? " " You mean like cookies ? " " Yes , ma'am . Alice . I can do cookies , or a cake if you 'd rather . " " Do you like to cook ? " " I like it fine . That 's what I 'd be doing right now . If I was at home . So I figure since this is home for a while , I ought to do what I 'd be doing . At home . " " Oh , of course , honey . Well , let 's go see what ingredients we 've got . It 's awfully hot for baking , is n't it ? " " Well , yes , I guess it is . In the summer , we generally do it in the morning when the day is still cool . Mama says the heat is just a little reminder for us of what it would be like to go to the other place . She says baking concentrates the mind because of that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say something , then closed it again . We went into the kitchen and she started pulling open cabinets and peering into them . There were a lot of cabinets , but they were full of things all jumbled together , not in lines or rows or anything . In one of them she found a bag of flour , but when she looked inside , she made a tsking sound with her mouth and threw it away . There was another bag of flour in another cabinet , and that one had never been opened , so she handed it to me . She found a can of baking powder and gave me that too . I checked the date on the bottom it had expired , but it would probably still work . She found sugar in a large canister and some walnuts in the freezer . " Do you have any vanilla ? " I asked . She gave me a bottle of extract with the cap kind of stuck on and gooey . " Any ginger ? " She handed me a little jar with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found me some on a shelf in the fridge . The fridge gave off a sour smell when she opened it , so she shut it back up quick . " Cookie sheet ? " Alice was smiling now , like we were having our own little game , and I have to say I was kind of enjoying it too . It felt good to do something normal , something I was used to . When everything I needed was piled up on the counter , I asked if she had some matches to light the oven . She said the oven lighted by itself and just to turn it on . I had a feeling Alice was n't really interested in baking at all , just in entertaining me , so I said that if she had other chores she needed to do , I would be happy to do the baking all on my own . She said that actually , she had brought some work home and needed to see to it , so I thanked her and she left . I found some mixing bowls in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I had put the cookies in the oven , I went back out into the living room . It was dark and a lot cooler than the kitchen . I listened for Alice but did n't hear her , so I sat down on one of the sofas . It was dark green and kind of prickly underneath a blanket with moons and stars on it . All around me were tall shelves crammed full of all kinds of books . I looked at some of their titles but I had never heard of any of them . We never read books by Lackers , or as Mama says , not by anybody unless they had heard the trumpet sound . A television was next to me , staring at me with its big blank eye . I had been sitting there for a while , not doing much of anything , when the front door opened and a girl came in . She looked surprised to see me , but then seemed to realize who I was . " Oh , hi , " she said , throwing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm Heather . " The way she said her name it sounded like it had a thousand Rs at the end of it . " Hi , I 'm Mary Fred , " I said , looking at her . She was tall , with wavy hair like Alice 's only darker brown , with a few streaks of orange and even a bit of what looked like blue but could n't have been , since hair is never blue . Where Alice was thin and wispy , Heather was more solid-looking , and her face was tan , though she seemed to have some kind of white makeup all over it . She had a lot of dark stuff on her eyes that had smudged . I stood up and went over to her in case she wanted to shake hands , but she just waved and threw herself into a big armchair . " So you 're , like , going to live with us for a while ? " " It looks that way . " I stood above where she was flopped in the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and neither of us said anything . I started to wonder if Heather was happy about getting a new family member . She did n't look all that happy . Alice came down the stairs that moment and said , " Puffin , what are you doing home ? " " Half-day , " Heather said . " We had a final . " " Really ? Already ? What was it in ? " " Bio . " Warming to the topic a little , Heather said , " It was so horrible . I thought I was going to die right in the middle . One kid actually started crying . " " Really ? Who ? " " Oh , it was Danny Fox . That dork . " I was n't sure what a dork was but it definitely did n't sound good . I expected to hear Alice tell Heather that we are all creatures of the earth and none of us are dorks , but she just said , " Mary Fred is baking cookies . Smell ? Mmmn , Mary Fred , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heather said in a miserable-sounding voice . " Just what I need . " She did n't sound happy at all about the cookies , so I was n't sure why she thought she needed them . Alice went into the kitchen and returned with two glasses of lemonade . She handed one to each of us and I knew I 'd have to guzzle mine down just to be polite . Heather swallowed hers in one gulp and put the empty glass down on a wooden end table , and Alice picked it up , saying , " Not on the wood , Puff , you 'll leave a ring . " She took it into the kitchen , then went upstairs . Heather picked up a plastic thing and pushed a button on it , and the television came on . " Do you watch All My Children ? " she asked . I had no idea what she was talking about , but I said no . On the screen , a man and a woman were in a bed , the man on top of the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , but when the police came into the room and the picture got bigger , you could see the woman was wearing black underwear . The man stood up he was wearing pants and the policeman put handcuffs on him and led him away . Then a woman came on and talked about vitamins . I finished my lemonade and brought it into the kitchen . I had washed all my dishes from baking , and I rinsed the glass out and put it on a wooden rack next to the sink . There were only a few minutes left till the cookies would be ready , so I decided to wait by the oven , since I figured the half-naked people would be back on the television pretty soon , and I knew Mama would n't want me to be anywhere near them . When the cookies were ready , I put them on a plate and brought it into the living room . Heather took one and said , " I 'm trying to lose weight . I 'm only going to have one . How do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cookies all the time ? " " I 'm just made this way I guess . My brothers always say if I turn sideways I 'll disappear . They say the crows will see me and fly away as fast as they can . " There , I had done it again I had said it as if they were still alive and were going to come in the door any minute and tease me about my skinniness . In spite of myself , I felt tears come into my eyes , but I blinked them away before Heather saw . I would n't want her to pity me , though I was n't sure she was the pitying type anyway . " I 'd give anything to have your body , " Heather said , taking a second cookie . " You look like a model . " " A model what ? " I asked , but Heather just laughed and did n't answer . I sat with Heather for a while in front of the television , doing my best to ignore what was on it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sitting room in case I got stuck here a lot and needed something to do . I hoped no one would think it was rude if I read to myself instead of participating in the family activities , whatever they turned out to be . I was a tiny bit curious about what was going to happen to the man on the television , but I did n't let myself look up because I could just about feel Mama smacking me on my hand and saying , " Mary Fred , now you know better . " So I sat staring at the carpet , which was one of those round knotted ones , faded and flattened in spots , and tried to think about all the nice things there would be about living here for a while . I would have my own room . I would have an opportunity to experience something new . And maybe if I was here long enough , I could share the Word of the Book with the Cullisons . That was a good thing , I thought , and I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in actual fact , Lackers would never hear the word , not in a million Sundays . I sat on the sofa most of the afternoon with Heather , trying not to pay any attention to whatever she was watching on the television . Whenever Alice would come into the room , I would look up at her and wait for her to tell us to get on with our chores , or for Heather to do her homework or something , but she would just pass through the room with a look on her face like she was thinking and disappear for a while . Heather sat with her leg over the side of the armchair , flipping the channels back and forth on the television . A bunch of the channels had people talking to large audiences about the strange things they had done , such as courting their sisters ' husbands and stuff like that . I figured that nobody would ever do anything that terrible , and I could n't understand how Heather could waste a whole day watching them as if they were real . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would say something to me about the people 's clothes , or their hair , but apart from that , we just kept quiet , which was fine with me . At about five o'clock , a man came in the front door . " Hi , Puff , " he said to Heather . I guessed that they called her Puff for some reason . He looked at me like he was n't expecting to see anyone else , then said , " Oh , you must be " He stopped , like he did n't know what my name was supposed to be . " I 'm Mary Fred , " I said , walking over to him and shaking his hand . " This is my uncle Roy , " Heather said , waving her hand toward him but not looking up . " Hi , Uncle Roy , " I said . I figured that was what I should call him too . Uncle Roy was carrying a big plastic bag . He put it down on the floor and looked at me , like he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like or not . He was n't much taller than me , with sandy , wavy hair like Alice 's , and a scraggly little beard . His hair was thinning in patches on top , like he 'd been tearing it out . He had one big , dark eyebrow and dark eyes . " So , Mary Fred , tell us about yourself , " he said , walking into the room and sitting on the sofa across from the television . " There 's not much to tell . I guess I 'll be here for a while . You probably know all the rest . " " More or less . " I expected him to say his condolences like most people did , but he did n't . " Are you going to be a good influence on our Puffin here ? " " I do n't know , Uncle Roy . I hope I 'm always an influence for good . " " Roy , " Alice said in a sharp voice , as she swung through the kitchen door , " are you already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , " Roy said . " I was just working up to it . I had n't even gotten started yet . " " Give it a rest , Roy , " Alice said , sounding snappish . " Just take the day off from being you . Mary Fred , how would you like to help me in the kitchen ? " " I 'd love to . " I jumped to my feet , relieved to have something to do besides not watch the stupid television shows or talk to Uncle Roy . " Did you see that , Puffin ? " Roy said to Heather . " That 's how it 's done . When someone asks you to do something , you respond in the affirmative . You do n't just continue to sit like a lump with a hearing impairment , or scream like someone is disemboweling you . " Heather seemed not to have noticed that Roy had even spoken . She was still flipping channels as I ran out of the room with Alice . It turned out that Alice did n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I managed to find plenty to do . After I had washed the remaining cookie sheets , I sorted through the fridge and threw out some old food that was making it smell bad , while Alice poked around , looking for something to make for dinner . " I 'm sorry , Mary Fred , I meant to go to the store and make you a special meal for your first night , but I just did n't have time . I brought work home today so I could be here for you , but it took longer than I thought , and I " " It 's perfectly all right , ma'am , " I said , though I felt a little sad about not getting a special welcome dinner . Then I decided well , I 'll help make dinner special for all of us one way or another . " What do you like to eat ? " Alice asked me . " Is there anything you do n't like ? Do you have any dietary restrictions ? " " No , I 'll eat anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish . Like the proverb says , If the child asks for a fish , give him a fish . " " I 'd never heard that , " Alice said . " I 'll get some fish tomorrow , I promise . Let 's see , what do we have for tonight ? " She started rummaging around in the freezer and pulled out a bunch of plastic containers and old boxes until she found a big package of frozen lasagna . We put that in the oven and then I found a bunch of carrots in the fridge and grated them for a salad . I put a little yogurt on them and some honey and raisins , and I scooped the salad into a pretty flowered bowl I found in a low cabinet . Next I went into the dining room to set the table . There were stacks of books on it , so I had to move them first , but I managed to find all the right plates and silverware and some paper napkins , and pretty soon it looked nice . The lasagna had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch of little things to do before dinner . I put all the clean dishes away , and I rearranged a couple of cabinets . I mopped part of the floor that had some sticky stuff on it , and I cleaned all the counters . When we sat down to dinner , Heather said , " Why is everything so fancy ? " She sounded grumpy . " Puffin would rather eat out of a trough , " Roy said . " It 's more efficient . " " Mary Fred made everything nice , " Alice said . She smiled , and I could see that she was glad about how nice things were . She seemed like the kind of person who liked things to be calm and sweet and pretty , but from the looks of it , nothing in her life was like that . I resolved to try to make things a little better for Alice , as part of my stay here . " Great lasagna , " Roy said , digging in . " My compliments to the chef at Le Club de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alice said , pushing the flowered bowl toward him . " Mary Fred made that . " She smiled at me , and I felt almost happy for a second . When I came downstairs the next morning , I was expecting to see everybody at the table already , since it was nearly eight when I finally got up . I 'd been dreaming I was at the Compound and I was trying to feed the chickens , but every time I looked in the big cabinet in the barn where we kept their food , bats would fly out at me , or birds , or giant bees , and I do n't think I ever did find the chickenfeed . The whole floor of the barn was mud , and as I walked across it , trying to get back to the big house , my feet stuck to the ground and I could n't pull them up . I tried yelling for Papa but I knew nobody could hear me , and when I woke up , I was making little P sounds with my mouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite finished . But nobody was in the dining room when I got there , and when I looked in the kitchen , it was empty too . I opened the fridge to look for something to cook , but there were n't any eggs , and all the breakfast things I knew how to make had eggs in them . Finally , I went back out into the sitting room and sat down on the sofa to wait for Alice to get up . I watched the clock as I sat there , humming to myself . I hummed " Holy Sanctuary " and " Where Is the Word to Be Found . " I hummed until my throat started to hurt , and then I just sat there , thinking the music instead . At about ten , Alice came downstairs in a flowered bathrobe . Her eyes looked sleepy and her hair was standing up all around her head like she 'd had a bad dream . " Oh , Mary Fred , " she said when she saw me , like she had totally forgotten I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " Did you help yourself to something to eat ? " Alice asked . " I 'm sorry , I forgot to show you where everything is . " " I was waiting for everybody else , " I said . " We never eat in the mornings , " Alice said . " I 'm so sorry , Mary Fred , I should have said something last night . Let me get you some cereal . " She stood there kind of twisting her hands together , like she felt really guilty for forgetting , so I said , " I never eat in the mornings either . It makes me kind of bilious . " This seemed to make her feel better , and she stopped twisting her hands and said , " Are you sure I ca n't get you some cereal ? " " Not till at least ten o'clock , " I said . " I never eat before that . " " I think it 's ten o'clock right now , " Alice said , turning to look at the clock behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top half of a grandfather . " This clock is always ten minutes slow . It 's really ten past ten . " " Well then , I guess I should have something to eat , " I said , jumping up and following Alice into the kitchen . She showed me some boxes of cereal on a high shelf in the pantry . When I opened the first one , a moth flew out , so I went for the second one , which was something called Tropical Muesli . It tasted kind of strange , like it had perfume in it , but it was okay . Alice asked if I wanted any coffee . I said no , that I had never had coffee before and did n't know if it would agree with me , so she made herself some . She sat across from me at the dining room table drinking it while I ate my cereal . She looked too tired to talk , so I did n't try to make conversation with her , but she kept thinking of things to say like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you need to go shopping ? " Alice asked . " Do you need anything ? Socks , underwear ? They give me a little allowance for you so I want to make sure you get everything you need . " I did n't think I ought to discuss underwear with someone I had just met , but then again , she was supposed to be my family for a while , so I said , " I brought five pairs of underpants , and we generally do the laundry every other day so they ought to do just fine . " Then I thought maybe Alice did n't have a washing machine in her house , and that I had just said something rude , so I said , " Of course , I can wash them out in the sink , " but then I thought , well maybe people do n't want people washing their dirty underwear out in sinks , where the germs might sit and wait for them , so I was about to say that I could change them every other day if necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was dirty , so I just opened and closed my mouth a couple of times like a fish . " Well , let me know if you need anything , " Alice said . " We can go shopping any time you want to . Clothes , makeup , whatever you need .... " I had never worn makeup in my life , but I just said thanks . After we finished breakfast , Alice went outside and got the newspaper from the front lawn , and she asked me if I wanted part of it . We had always made a point of never reading the newspaper , since it was all lies , but I did n't want to say that to Alice , so I looked at some of it . I read the comics and then a thing called a horoscope that seemed to be telling everybody what to do . Papa would say that that was how the government controlled people 's minds , but it did n't sound like the horoscope was asking anyone to do anything bad . The advice for Aries was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch all day for someone wearing mauve and green and then ask them if they were Aries . " What 's Aries ? " I asked Alice , so I 'd know . " That 's someone born anywhere from March 21 to April 20 or so . What sign are you , Mary Fred ? " " Sign ? " " When 's your birthday ? " " December 14 . " " That makes you a Sagittarius . That 's what I am too . Mine 's December 10 . " " Well , then I guess we should look beyond the immediate and gain an overall view . Stress ability to make friend of one from foreign land . Question concerning marriage will loom large . Pisces plays dominant role . " " Roy 's a Pisces , " Alice said . " Does this mean that when a person 's birthday is tells them what they ought to do ? " " Sort of . Maybe . I do n't know if it really means anything , Mary Fred , but some people believe in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe a little . I basically think we 're responsible for our own destinies . " Now , I knew better than to argue with this , because of course we 're all in the hands of the One , but I understood that Lackers often thought that they were deciding things for themselves . Part of me wanted to try to convince Alice to follow the One and come with me into the Hereafter when the Big Cat came , but I had had enough experience with Lackers to know that they were n't going to listen , and that alls that would happen is they would want to discuss things . And Papa always said those things were best left alone . Lackers would hear when the lame walked and the blind received their sight , Papa said , and meanwhile , it was no use sowing a seed on barren ground . So I asked why they had the horoscopes in the newspaper . Alice said they were for entertainment . " Anyway , " she said , " you 're too young for marriage to loom large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , " I said . Alice shook her head and looked kind of sad . " Maybe I 'm the friend from a foreign land , " I said . She looked at me and smiled . " I do n't think Frederick County is a foreign land , do you ? " I smiled and said no , but the fact was , this place did seem like a foreign land to me , in fact , like a whole new planet . We 'd been sitting there for a while , reading the paper and not saying anything , when Heather came down . Her eyes were still almost closed , and she moved unsteadily , like she was sleepwalking . I had seen someone sleepwalking once at the Compound one night and he almost fell into the lake . The men had to holler and wake him . Heather waved a hand and lurched herself into a chair , looking at me like she was trying to remember who I was . " Good morning , Heather , " I said . Heather made a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning back to me , so she did . I waited for Alice to jump up and ask Heather to help her get some breakfast , but she went on reading the paper . After a while , Heather picked herself out of the chair , went into the kitchen , and came back with a bag of potato chips . " Do n't eat potato chips for breakfast , " Alice said , glancing at Heather and then looking back at the paper . I was n't at all surprised when Heather went right on eating the potato chips as if her mother had n't said anything . I was getting the hang of things . It was just past noon when Roy came down the stairs . He was wearing a green T-shirt and blue jeans with holes in them , and he did n't look very clean . His hair was all messy and his beard looked even more scraggly than before . We were still sitting at the table . I had gone and taken a shower and then cleaned up some in the kitchen until Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty , " she said . " Just relax . " Of course I was used to relaxing , but we did it on Sunday afternoon after church . Papa always used to say , " Humankind is made for the Sabbath , not the Sabbath for humankind . " " I left you some coffee , " Alice said as Roy went into the kitchen . The big wooden door swung closed behind him and then swung back open a minute later with him carrying a big clay mug that looked like it had been made by someone in kindergarten . By this time , I knew he was n't going to say good morning or anything , but I thought I 'd have some fun with him so I said , " Good morning , Uncle Roy , did you sleep well ? " Roy nodded and took a big guzzle of coffee . " I guess you 're a morning person , " Alice said to me , smiling like the very thought of being a morning person made her feel tired all over again . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Like the Energizer Bunny , " Heather said . It was the first thing she 'd said so far today . " The who ? " Heather looked at me sadly . " Mary Fred , " she said , " you 're going to have to watch more TV . " By midafternoon , I had already cleaned the kitchen , vacuumed the sitting room rug , which Heather would only let me do during commercials , and cleaned and rearranged the closet in my room . Alice was puttering around , watering plants ( there were lots of plants everywhere , most of them brown and wilting ) , and stopping at the dining table to rest every so often . I thought about dusting , but Alice said she did n't have a feather duster , and some of the little stuff she had everywhere was too delicate for a rag , so I decided I would use some of the allowance she got for me to buy a feather duster when we went shopping . " Mary Fred , " Alice said finally as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really , you do n't have to do any chores . We did n't have you come here so you could work . " " I feel better when I keep busy , " I said . " Oh , " Alice said , as if she suddenly remembered all about me . " I 'm so sorry , Mary Fred . Of course you do . After all , you 've been through so much . I should have thought of some kind of structured activity for you to do . I 'm so used to Heather . She just kind of sits around all the time , so it did n't occur to me that you might need something more " She broke off in the middle of a sentence and stood with her hand on her chin , like she was trying to think of something for me to do . Then she waved both hands in the air and said , " Do n't worry , we 'll think of something . " " Until we do , " I said , " is it okay if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course . It 's great , in fact , I really appreciate it . " I had just finished scrubbing the bathroom floor when Alice asked if I wanted to go to the grocery store with her . I said sure , and we went to a store that was so big , you could have fit the Compound 's general store into it about twenty-five times and still had room left over for all of the Apostles to do cartwheels . They had a gigantic fish counter , full of all kinds of big fish with the heads still on them , so Alice bought one for dinner . We bought some rice , and some green beans , and a lot of strange things that Alice said Heather liked pink breakfast cereals , and rolls of tape that were made of fruit , and some frozen things with jelly and icing that were supposed to be strudel but did n't look like any strudel I 'd ever seen . " Is there anything I can buy you ? " Alice asked me , her voice almost pleading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ma'am , I think I 've got everything I need . " We had picked up the feather duster . " Maybe a can of Campbell 's Cream of Mushroom soup to go with the green beans . " " Okay . Anything else ? " " No 'm . I think that 's it . " " Oh , Mary Fred , " Alice said , looking like she was going to burst into tears . " I just feel so inadequate . I do n't know what to do , or how to help you . I want to do a good job at this , but I do n't think I know how . What was I thinking ? I 'm such a terrible mother anyway , and now " I put my arm around her and patted her on the shoulder . " It 's fine , ma'am . Alice . Really , I 'm happy as can be . " We were standing near the express checkout line , since we had fewer than fifteen items , and on the shelf next to it were some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't know what they were , but I said , " Oh , Alice , can I have one of these ? " I picked one up and showed it to her . " Of course you can , Mary Fred , " she said , wiping one eye and looking at me like I had just done something really nice for her instead of the other way around . I asked if we could get one for Heather too , and she said sure , so I grabbed another one . That meant we had sixteen items , but Alice took us through the express line anyway and the woman at the cash register never said a thing about it . Heather seemed to like the little beads she ate them right up before dinner and everyone liked the green beans with mushroom soup . It felt funny sitting around the dinner table and eating the same food I 'd be eating at home , but without saying the Beautiful Prayer first , and without my real family . Uncle Roy made some comment about sitting there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , or even at the table . Still , it was a nice dinner , and I think they liked it . They were all kind of smiley afterward , even Heather , who did n't smile much in general . I had folded up the paper napkins into little swans , and after dinner she wanted me to show her how to do it , so I did . Then Alice made her come help us in the kitchen , while Roy took out the garbage , because it was getting kind of smelly with the fish and all , and Heather showed me where all the dishes belonged and helped me wipe them . While we were working , she talked about her school . She said her French test last Friday had n't been too bad , the only bad part was that she was concentrating so hard while she was taking it that her foot fell asleep , so when she stood up to go turn the test in , she fell over sideways and could n't manage to stand upright , and everybody laughed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " But it was n't your fault , " I said . " I mean , a person ca n't help if their foot goes to sleep . " " Mary Fred 's right , Puffin , " Alice said . " It 's not like you did it on purpose . " " I do n't care , I just looked like the biggest dork in the world , " Heather said , rolling her eyes . " And stop calling me Puffin . " " How come everybody calls you Puffin ? " I asked her . " They should n't , " she said , giving Alice a dark look . " They know not to call me Puffin . But they do it anyway . " " I do n't know , " Alice said . " Roy , why do we call Puffin Puffin ? " " It 's because when she was born , she was all puffy , " Roy said , coming back through the kitchen with the garbage can and putting it down beside the sink . " Her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That 's not why , " Heather said , punching Roy on the arm , which kind of shocked me in spite of myself . " It 's because when I was born , I looked like a bird . A puffin . That 's what Dad always says . " " Does he ? " Alice asked . She stopped wiping the dish she was holding and stood staring at Heather like this was some really interesting information . " Is that what he says ? " " He says I had this cute little beak , " Heather went on , looking pleased with herself . " And I made these little tweeting noises , like a puffin . " " I do n't think your father is up on his ornithology , " Roy said . " I do n't think puffins tweet . " " They do tweet , " Heather said . " And they 're really cute . That 's what he says . " " You were a cute baby , " Alice said . " You had such tiny little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big hands with her soapy , wet one , and Heather let her hold it for about a second , then snatched it away . Alice turned to me , as if to be fair , and said , " Do you have a nickname in your family , Mary Fred ? " " Sometimes everyone calls me M.F. , " I said . " We have a lot of Fred names in my family so sometimes we use initials to keep from getting confused . " " M.F. ? " Roy sort of smirked . " That 's nice , " Alice said . " So other people in your family are named Fred too ? Is that a family name ? " " No , ma'am , " I said . I had explained this to many Lackers before in the past , but still , I always felt surprised when people asked me this . " It 's our religion . People tend to be named after Fred . " " Oh , so your whole family is , um , named after Fred ? " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sisters . " " What are their names ? " Alice asked . " Well , there are the little ones . Fredericka , we call her Rickie , then Bobby Fred , then Billy Fred , but we call him Biffles , then Boo , who is really Susie Fred , then " My voice got stuck when I came to Little Freddie , and I just stopped there . " Who 's Fred ? " Heather asked . " Fred is our founder , " I said , staring down at the floor while my eyes watered . " Fred was the man who founded us and found us and brought us into the light . That 's how we say it , usually . He brought us into the light . " " How exactly did he do this ? " Roy asked . I looked up at him and saw that he had a little smile on his face . " With his Prophecy . And his Holy Book . " " So your family met this Fred person and followed him to where were you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we moved up to Maryland . But we never met him . " " No ? " " No , he lived a long time ago . He died in 1947 . " " But his ideas lived on ? " " That 's right . " Although he sounded polite enough , I had a feeling Uncle Roy thought there was something funny about this , and since I did n't , I resolved to just clam up . This was how things went with Lackers , and while of course I was n't angry , since as Papa always said , there was no point in being angry with Lackers , it was like being mad at the rain for ruining your picnic , still , I was getting this feeling in my stomach like someone had stuck a knife in it and was giving it a good twist . I decided to try not to talk about my family with anyone , especially not Roy , and it probably was n't a very good idea to talk about the Book either , since I might as well have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Sunday , and when I got up , at first I thought I had better get ready for church , but then when I thought more about it , I was absolutely positive that no one would be going to church . I went downstairs and sure enough , none of them were there everyone was still asleep . I brought the Book down with me and just sat reading it for a while , though I kept daydreaming in the middle of the page , so then I felt bad , like my mind was going to start Lacking if I did n't watch out . What I kept imagining were my brothers and sisters in their church clothes , and Mama and Papa leading us down the path to the Chapel at the Compound , past the wild raspberry bushes and the honeysuckle that grew all over everything . I could see Fred and Little Freddie running after Boo , trying to tickle her , and how they 'd pick her up and whirl her around , and how she would scream and laugh and yell at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best was to be swung in the air . When I started to feel sad like this , I would pick up the Book and find some comfort in it , like I would read about the Sabbath and how we should keep it holy and not do any work , and rest like the Lord rested . I tried to have the feeling of Sunday all by myself , but things kept getting in the way of it the sounds of cars outside , and the big TV that sat looking at me with its square blank face . I read the part in the Book about the Imminence , but it just did n't make me feel any more holy , since all I could think about was how I was sitting in some Lackers ' living room , and it was Sunday , and no one was going to church , or anywhere else for that matter . After a while I just put the Book down and went into the kitchen and made myself some toast . I wondered where Mama and Papa were right now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Littles were , and if they were living with Lackers too , and watching television , and forgetting the holy Word . I imagined Rickie and Boo wearing fancy dresses and saying a bunch of cuss words , and then I tried to stop myself from picturing that . I knew Rickie would never behave like that , though to be honest , I had some doubts about Boo . She was six and had a dramatic wa y with her , at least that 's what Mama and Papa always said . I wondered what they were doing right now , and it seemed so strange to think they were all out there somewhere and I did n't even know where . Then I wondered why I was feeling so bad suddenly , like I had fallen down and bruised myself all over on the inside . I went back into the sitting room with my toast on a plate . Back home , we 'd never be allowed to eat in the sitting room , but I had seen Heather break this rule several times yesterday so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV while I ate , feeling bored and angry . Here it was , Sunday morning , and I was lounging in front of a TV in my gardening trousers instead of in the family pew at the Compound , and I had n't heard a sermon in nearly three weeks , and if I was n't careful I was going to start Lacking , I was going to let Evil into my heart , and before I knew it , I 'd be wearing a golden gown and feathers like some hootchie-kootchie woman . That was what the Reverend Thigpen said sometimes . And meanwhile , I did n't have any idea where the Littles were , and I only hoped that wherever it was I guessed they had all gone to different families they were n't going to start Lacking , and they were n't lonely and afraid and crying for Mama and me . I picked up the remote from the sofa where Heather had thrown it and flicked on the TV . I flipped the channels around past a bunch of cartoon bears and some ugly puppets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . For a moment I felt relieved , like I was going to be okay , because I could spend my Sundays at the TV church and not fall away from the News , but after I listened to the man for a few minutes , I shut the TV off again . He was talking about the same Words we talked about , but I could see that deep down , he was really a Lacker . He was talking about the God of Peace and Kindness , and it was the kind of thing that the Reverend Thigpen warned us was really just Evil talking in a pearly guise . That 's what he said . " If Evil cast out Evil , then Evil is divided against itself , " the Book said . I felt divided against myself , like I was n't sure anymore exactly what Evil was . I just hoped none of it had found its way into me and tried to make a home there like someone camping in a ditch . By the time everyone got up , it was nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been sitting there for hours , I was bored , and I felt restless , like I was all shivery and twitchy inside and needed a good run , or maybe a horseback ride . Alice got up first and said good morning to me in her ghostly way , making a beeline for the coffeepot like she was dying of thirst . Then Heather came down and mumbled something , grabbing a bag of cookies and flinging herself down with them on the sofa . I could see crumbs spraying from her mouth in a fine mist . Finally , Roy got up , looking grim and grubby , without so much as a word to anyone . I just sat there , watching everyone waste a perfectly beautiful Sunday morning when they could have been out serving someone somehow . " Do n't you get tired of just sitting ? " I asked Heather . She looked at me like I had said something ridiculous . " I get tired if I do n't sit , " she said . " So then I sit some more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But do n't you feel like the whole world is just waiting for you to get up and do something ? Like there 's this really important thing out there that you could be doing , and you 're just sitting here instead , and the important thing is going to pass right by you and you 'll never even know what it was ? " Heather seemed to think for a minute . Then she said , " No . " I will say that Alice made us a nice lunch , with cream of tomato soup and some bread that she took out of the freezer and then put in the oven and it came out like fresh bread . She had put some onions and some wilted leaves from the fridge into the tomato soup so it tasted strange , but I kind of liked it that way . I did n't say much during lunch I had a lumpy feeling in my throat , and it was too hard to get food past it and talk at the same time . When we had finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plate , and Heather went back to the sofa , and Alice and me cleared up the table and did the dishes . Alice was talking to me about Heather 's father and how he was going to take Heather to France for two weeks , and how she did n't really want Heather to go to France but she did n't see any way out of it . I said that from what I understood , all the people in France just drank wine all the time and got into mischief because of it , and that the women did n't wear underwear , and I could understand if she did n't want Heather in a place like that . " It 's not that , really , " Alice said , staring at a stack of dishes like she 'd forgotten what they were . " I just do n't want her to be away for her birthday , and for such a long time . And I do n't like the idea of her taking a plane . What if something happened I just could n't deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something was going to happen anyway , the Big Cat was coming , and coming soon , but that would just have made her feel worse , plus being a Lacker , there was nothing she could do about it anyway , so why tell her . So I said , " I 'm sure everything will be fine . Those planes are really safe . They 're big and powerful , so if they run into any trouble they can just fly away from it real fast . And when they land , they 've got all kinds of emergency landing gear so if one set of gear does n't work , the extra ones open right up , no problem . " " I 'm sure you 're right , Mary Fred . It 's just that she 's never been that far away from me . Usually he just takes her to Florida or the Caribbean . I do n't like the idea of her being across a whole ocean , especially on her birthday . " " It 's hard being separated from your people , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the best of it . " " Oh , Mary Fred , " she said . " I 'm sorry . I had n't thought . " " It 's okay , " I said . " No , really , I 'm sorry . It 's so selfish of me to think of worrying about a little two-week vacation , when you 're really , I 'm so " " It 's okay , " I said in a voice that sounded surprisingly hard to me . " I 'm grown up enough to know that whatever the Will has set forth for me , well , that 's the path I have to take , and sometimes it 's a path I do n't much like , sometimes it 's a hard path , like when the One decides to just take both of my brothers , it 's hard , Alice , but when you truly have faith , then you know , why , you just know that it 's " " It 's so hard , I know , " Alice said , like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . " I know . " " You could n't possibly know , " I said , my voice a little rasp like Evil was starting to possess me and make itself heard . " You just could n't possibly imagine . " Alice started toward me but I held up my hand , palm outward , to ward her off . " It 's my own burden , ma'am , not yours . My yoke is easy and my burden is light . " " It 's not easy , Mary Fred , " Alice said , stopping about a foot from me and looking at me with sad eyes . " I understand that . I wish there was something I could do to help . " " There 's nothing you can do , " I said , taking a step backward . " There 's nothing any Lacker could possibly do . It 's just the way things are . " " Let me know , Mary Fred , if there 's anything " Alice held out her hands , palms outward , almost in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to me . " I apologize , ma'am , " I said . " I do n't know what came over me . I just lost the discipline of my tongue for a minute there . " I said I was sorry , and Alice said it was okay , and we finished the dishes without mentioning anything else about it . The truth was , though , I did n't really feel sorry ; I felt stiff and unkind inside , like someone had starched me . We were going to work in the garden in the afternoon , but right after lunch it started to rain . I was n't even surprised , since I felt all rainy myself , but it meant we were going to sit in the sitting room all afternoon while Heather changed the channels every couple of seconds . Roy had gone back upstairs . Alice sat at the dining room table with a pile of catalogues . I looked at them for a while with her some had books in them and some had movies , and none of them had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiscal year was ending at work and she needed to order a bunch of stuff for the library by June 30 , otherwise the money would just go to waste . I could hear Papa saying in my mind that there was only One Book and One Word , and he did n't approve of movies at all anyway . The Reverend Thigpen said they were all just a bunch of undulating flesh . Every so often Heather would pass a movie on the TV , and she would leave it on for a few minutes and before I knew it , I was wondering what happened to the people on the speeding bus , or the people being chased by dinosaurs , but luckily she 'd flip to a new channel before I got too interested , and sometimes she would say , " Boring , " like it was two words , Bo and Ring . I began to picture Bo and Ring as two clowns who danced around in the living room , trying to entertain Heather . It was not easy and I felt sorry for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the garden with me ? " I said after a while when I noticed that the rain had let up a little . " It 's raining , " Heather said . " No , it 's stopped . Look , the sun is coming out . " " But it 's all wet out there . " " It 's summer . It 's a nice , warm wetness . The ground will smell nice . " " The ground will smell like cat poop , " Heather said . " Trust me . " " Heather , go on out with Mary Fred , " Alice called from the dining room . " It 'll do you good . " " You 're crazy if you think I 'm going out there and getting soaked , " Heather said . Whenever she talked to her mother , she raised her voice to a little screech . " You 're totally nuts . " I stood up and said , " Well , I 'm going to go out and do some weeding . " As I walked past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to , Mary Fred , it 's okay , but I do n't want you to " " I need " I stopped in the middle of the sentence , not exactly sure what I was saying . Then suddenly , I was n't even sure where I was . It seemed like I had landed somewhere strange where I did n't recognize anything . The room looked small and fake , like I was watching everything on a television . " I need " At that moment , Roy came down the stairs . His eyes were all slitty , like he 'd been sleeping . " What do you need , Mary Fred ? " His voice was raspy , like he had a frog in his throat , or maybe a big dog . I looked at him and said , " I do n't know . " I ran into the kitchen and out the back door into the yard , past the spready oak and over to the toolshed , which was made of metal and kind of leaned to one side , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside , and it took a lot of hunting through it but I finally found a trowel . I kneeled down in a bed of nasty yellow flowers and started digging up the ground between them . It was all overgrown with weeds , and the flowers were being strangled . I could see their sad little faces just gasping for breath . I was used to taking gardening very seriously , partly because we grew all our own food at the Compound , and a lot of it at the Outpost , but also because we believed that the World Beyond was a garden , and we needed to know how to live there . The Reverend Smith had always said we had to develop all our skills in this world because we were going to need them , but that everything would be easier there , flowers would jump from the ground and reach up overhead in praise , and the fruits and vegetables would just bust out all over like fireworks . The cows would beg us to make them into hamburger meat , and the sheep would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would overfloweth . When the Reverend Smith said this , I pictured a huge table with a white tablecloth , and all my family sitting there , and our friends from the Compound , the ones that had died in the fire and the ones who were in prison , and my brothers would be at the head of the table , and we 'd be eating these great big tomatoes the size of watermelons and saying Hallelujah . When I looked up , I noticed that it had started raining again and that I had been kneeling in the dirt , crying , for some time . It was strange how all this time I had n't really cried at all , just a little here and there , because Mama had said not to cry , but there was something about the garden in the World Beyond that must have gotten to me . How beautiful it was , and how when I opened my eyes back up again , I was in a pile of weeds in front of Alice 's toolshed . That was the worst part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world was pretty enough sometimes , at least some of it was , the next was going to be so much prettier that I could hardly stand how long it would take to get there . There were things about life on earth that I had liked Sunday dinners , and playing soldiers in the woods with Fred , Little Freddie , and Rickie , and riding our horses across the fields . But now it seemed like the happy things about this world were gone , and there was nothing to do but wait for the next . I looked up at the spready oak , and it seemed to lead all the way up to the places that mattered . When I went back in the house , Alice was standing in the kitchen , talking to Roy . They stopped talking when I came in and then Alice said , " Roy , it 's getting late and we have nothing for dinner . Could you go out and pick something up ? " Of course , what I was thinking was that Alice seemed surprised that here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat again , as if she did n't realize that we were all going to have to eat today , and tomorrow , and very day after that . We had been in the grocery store just yesterday , but she had only bought enough for one day , like she was thinking that she never knew for sure if the next day was going to happen or not . I could have told her that she was right about that , because the Big Cat was coming , and coming soon , but I did n't see the point of mentioning it . Roy was saying that he had stuff to do and he did n't see how he was going to have time to go pick up dinner , but Alice just handed him two new-looking twenty-dollar bills and gave him a firm , mean look , at least it was mean for Alice . Bad as I still felt , I almost laughed at the way she knitted her eyebrows together and took in her breath like she was about to start yelling at him , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at anyone . Roy took the money , wadded it up , and stuffed it in his pocket , but then he sat down in a chair next to Heather in the living room , like he was too tired to go anywhere just yet . " Mary Fred , you 're soaking wet , " Alice said , looking at me . " Let me get you a towel . " " I 'm okay , " I said , though she was right , I was soaked to the skin . Alice went upstairs and came back with a long stripy towel . She wrapped it around my shoulders and started rubbing me dry . I found myself pushing her arms away and taking a few steps backward . Alice handed me the towel , like she had n't noticed how rude I 'd just been . I took it , draped it over me , and began to dry my hair . The towel got all wet and smelled like rain , and I held it in front of my nose , just breathing , in and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped drying myself and stood there , just smelling , and pretty soon my shoulders started to shake . I felt myself drop down to my knees , onto the hard floor , and lay my forehead down against it , still in the towel . I was making this howling sound , like wolves had gotten into me somehow . " Mary Fred ? " I felt Alice 's hand on my head . I shook my head underneath the towel and kept on howling . " Mary Fred ? What can I do for you ? Tell me . " I did n't say anything . " Puffin , go make Mary Fred some chamomile tea . Mary Fred , come here , I 'm going to help you over to the couch . " I felt Alice 's arms lift me up and walk me over to the sofa next to where Puffin had been . I felt myself sit down , and Alice 's arms go around me . I let her keep them there for a moment , but when she peeled the towel away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw her face , puzzled and concerned , her graying hair all in a frazzle and the glasses that she wore sometimes on the end of her nose a little bit crooked , and I just shook my head again . " What can I do for you , Mary Fred ? " " Nothing . There 's nothing anyone can do . The One will wipe away every tear from mine eyes and guide me to the water of life . " " You want some tea ? " Heather asked . She was holding a steaming cup out to me . " No , thank you , " I said . My voice was sounding so evil again that it scared me . I looked at the three of them . I was amazed that Heather had actually done something her mother asked her to do and gone and made me tea . Alice was sitting next to me , staring miserably at me like she was waiting for me to snap out of it . Roy was standing a few feet away from me , looking more awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing I want from any of you Lackers , " I went on . " I just have to wait for the Imminence , and then I 'll be in the garden and everything will be fine . The Big Cat is coming , and coming soon , and I 'll be leaving you all behind anyway . You 'll all be down here broiling in the lake of fire , and I 'll be at the white table with my brethren , feasting on the feast of true foods , while the flowers reach around me like the hands of the Apostles , and fruits fall from the sky like holy rain . Yea , then it will rain and rain true fire for you , holy water for me . I 'll be in the kingdom of the Eternal One for all eternity . It wo n't be long now , no , it wo n't be long . " By now , a mixed-up bunch of the Reverend Thigpen 's words and the Words of the Book were pouring from me like hailstones . I shut my mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then Roy said , " What brought this on , Mary Fred ? " The stupid look had gone from his face and he just looked worried and confused . " Is it because it 's Sunday ? " I felt my eyes fill with more tears . " You miss your family worse on a Sunday , do n't you ? " he said . I did n't say anything . Roy took a few steps backward , nodding the whole time like he 'd just made a brilliant discovery . He looked at Alice , who shook her head like she was too tired to know how to speak , and then he went out the front door . When he had gone , I let Alice put her arm around me . Heather went back into the kitchen and I could hear running water , like she was doing dishes or something . After a while , I felt so limp and tired that I just laid my head down on Alice 's shoulder . Her shoulder smelled funny , like her shirt had been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underneath it smelled a little sweaty , but it was a comforting smell . I hid my face in the towel again and we just sat there like that for a while . When I was done crying , Alice held both of my hands and looked into my face . " Mary Fred , this is hard , I know , but we 'll get through it somehow . " " How long will I have to be here ? " I asked , still sniveling . " I do n't know . The court has given us custody of you indefinitely . It all depends on on what happens . It 's hard to adjust , I know everything is so different .... " " So different , " I said . " And we must seem strange to you . But you know , you 're strange to us too . We 're just all different , that 's all . Every-body 's different . " " I know that , " I said , sounding grumpy like Heather . But the truth was , I had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was n't that I had n't liked them , but I had just felt sorry for them , for all the suffering they were going to have that I was going to miss out on , and it did n't make me want to know anybody like that very well . There was too much pitying involved . " Come on , " Alice said , standing up , still holding my hands . " Let 's set the table . Do you have Sunday dinner at home ? " " Of course . " " Let 's make it fancy . Can you make those swans out of napkins for me now ? " " I guess . " " I 'll get the dishes . " Alice went into a wooden cabinet and took out a bunch of flowered plates with gold rims that I had n't seen before , and some glasses with stems . She went into a drawer and drug out some silverware that looked all old and tarnishy . I sat down at the table with a stack of napkins and started making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use one to dry my eyes or blow my nose . When I had finished the swans , I went upstairs to the bathroom and washed my hands . I looked at myself in the mirror . My eyes were all red and the lashes were stuck together , and my cheeks were pale but with pink spots in them . I splashed cold water on my face until it was all reddish , and then I patted myself dry with a dirty little hand towel . When I came downstairs again , the table was set , and Alice had put yellow candles in big brass candlesticks right in the center and lit them . She had lowered the lights in the room so that the candles lit most of it , and the TV had been turned off and music with violins was playing . The front door swung open and Roy walked in , carrying three big paper bags that said " Chicken A Go-Go " on the side . He took them into the kitchen , and before long , he and Alice came back out carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of the table . We all sat down . Roy was about to start eating , but Alice asked , " Do you have a prayer you want to say ? " At first I just sat for a minute , not saying anything . I could hear the sound of my breaths as they passed in and out of my body . But then I said the Beautiful Prayer , and we ate .
