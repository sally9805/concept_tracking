Hunger and the Middle Class // Divorce and the Downward Spiral // Ruth blushed deeply when she opened the front door of her gabled Victorian home . She was embarrassed because she knew that no one expected to find hunger here among the beautiful estates , expansive green lawns , expensive shops , BMWs , swimming pools and thoroughbred horses . Her upscale suburb is a blend of old and new money . Affluence manifests itself in the architecture , the attitudes , even the supermarkets . // " I found myself in this situation literally overnight , " she said , her thin arms waving like sea plants as she led me through a central hall , past a winding , carpeted staircase into the once formal dining room that now serves as her makeshift office . // She was a pretty woman even now after four years of hardship , thin but still sensuous , a thirty-eight-year-old college graduate with thick brown hair and a deep commitment to Judaism . // " About an hour before a big family bar mitzvah , my husband , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his office assistant . It was a total shock . I was standing in the bathroom putting on my makeup . My eighty-four-year-old father was sitting downstairs on the living room sofa all dressed up in his suit and my kids were running around the bedroom chasing the hamster . Out of nowhere , my husband opened the bathroom door without knocking and told me , like it was a weather report , that he was having an affair with a twenty-two-year-old kid . My legs got weak . I started shaking . I could n't even turn around to look at him but I saw his reflection in the mirror . // " ' Alan , I ca n't deal with this now , ' I finally said . ' How could you tell me a thing like this when we 're on our way out the door ? How can I stand there with you and all these relatives and make polite conversation and act like nothing is wrong ? ' // " ' Yes , of course . I understand . I 'm sorry , ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . My husband was always a master of the bedside manner . ' You go . We 'll talk when you come home . ' // " So I took the kids and my father and I went , which was probably the worst mistake of my life , besides marrying him in the first place , but I needed time to think . I wanted to appear calm and in control . " // Ruth suddenly stopped talking and motioned me toward a chair with green upholstery . // " I 'm sorry , " she said , pressing my hand into her palm . " I did n't even think to offer you a chair . I just started talking my head off . This subject always gets me going . I should never have let him out of my sight , " she continued once I was sitting , " but I did n't know then what I know today . When I got home , two hundred dollars was on the table . He had cleaned out his papers , packed his bag and left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward a little and her shoulders fell . " Not even a note . That was in August . On that day , that one summer day , our whole world changed . Can you imagine ? " // I put down my notebook and thought of telling her that my own husband left , in much the same way , two years after he graduated from medical school . I thought about saying that I understood , not just the economic crisis and the fear of hunger , but the other feeling of loss . Ruth seemed like she was about to say something . I laid the bundle of my own feelings and memories aside and picked up my notebook again . // " You look upset . I 'm sorry if I upset you . You want a glass of water ? " she asked . " We 've got plenty of water . " // " Yes . Thanks , " I said as I glanced around the room . There were court briefs , letters and legal documents piled on the table and stacked on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw me looking around , she sniffed and grabbed a Kleenex from a box that sat in the middle of the dining room table . // " You think this is a lot of paperwork , " she said as she handed me the glass . " This is just the beginning . This is nothing . " Her eyes moistened . " I have crates and crates of legal papers upstairs . It 's been a long fight . I 'm in a situation that I never expected to be in . All I ever wanted to have was a happy , complete family because that 's the thing I had missed the most in my own childhood . // " I know now that I 'm like a lot of women , millions of women who 've been left alone without support , but I did n't know that then . I had no idea what to do when he walked out , absolutely no idea . He has a private practice in the city . It cost $350,000 to finance . I had cosigned the loan , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets . He had emptied our joint account , so I had no money at all for about a week . When we ran out of food , I began borrowing money from my father , but he did n't have much because we had already borrowed most of my father 's retirement money when we bought this house . // " I started by calling lawyers right out of the Yellow Pages but they all wanted retainers of fifteen hundred to three thousand dollars just to get started . I did n't have it , of course . So , tell me what does a woman do when , all of a sudden , something like this happens that she never expected to happen ? " // I was silently taking notes , still searching for something reassuring to say . My own husband had promised to send child support , then stopped after a few months . I had finally asked a cousin who was an attorney to help but I never received monthly payments again . There was no point in telling her that . //   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
