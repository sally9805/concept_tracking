For Sarah Bouser , 17 , shopping for clothes was never fun . Unlike her thinner friends , she always had trouble finding fashionable clothes that fit her full-size figure . Then she discovered Torrid , the first mall-based boutique for plus-size teens . " Before , I wore a lot of boys ' clothes , " she says , browsing the Torrid store in Brea , Calif. , one of the chain 's six outlets . " Now I feel more feminine . " <P> For teens like Sarah who have grown up in fashion hell , fashion heaven has arrived . The 1-year-old Torrid is geared to selling trendy junior fashions and accessories ( read : body jewelry ) to customers who have never had this kind of choice : young women , ages 15 to 29 , who wear sizes 14 to 26 . " When you think fashionable , you think of young , sexy and fun , " says Wedbush Morgan Securities analyst Elizabeth Pierce . " No one has wanted to put ' plus ' into the same sentence . Torrid has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and the timing could not be better for its 361-store parent , Hot Topic , which is hitting some growth bumps in its namesake brand . The $336 million-a-year company , based in City of Industry , Calif. , will add 15 Torrid stores this year . " It 's about style , not about size , " notes Hot Topic CEO Betsy McLaughlin , who says the idea for Torrid blossomed out of pleas from Hot Topic customers for larger-size merchandise . In North Attleboro , Mass. , store manager Amy Lynn , 23 , who sports purple-streaked hair and a tongue stud , says she hears girls shriek : " Finally , something that fits me ! " Torrid suits Wall Street too . Hot Topic 's stock price has risen 33% since Torrid 's launch . Says Wells Fargo securities analyst Jennifer Black : " The market for Torrid is huge , no pun intended . " <P> The claim is n't oversize . Half of all U.S. women 15 and older wear a size 14 or larger . And market research firm NPD Fashionworld figures plus-size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22% increase from the year before . <P> These numbers are not just tipping scales at Torrid . Lane Bryant , the plus-size chain , is getting trendier to draw a younger crowd . Victoria 's Secret recently introduced its first 40-DD bra . And designers Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren , with plus-size lines planned , are realizing there are as many wide bodies as waifs out there . <P> Still , Torrid has a fashion edge that differentiates it from other retailers . The store 's floor-to-ceiling racks are filled with black corsets , sassy T shirts ( notice me. your boyfriend is about to ) , leather pants , lace-up jeans , plaid miniskirts , even sexy lingerie  --  much of it with sought-after teenage labels like Paris Blues , HotKiss and Dickies . The store 's lush look ( New Orleans romantic fantasy meets Gothic ) is unique too . Red-vinyl-upholstered benches ring the shoe area , hand-blown chandeliers hang from the ceiling , and gargoyles grace the cash-wrap . <P> Will black-lace-trimmed purple panties play in Peoria ? Why not ? Cool is the common denominator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to hate yourself , " says Maria Gutierrez , 17 , who recently drove 40 miles to the Brea store to look for a prom dress . The challenge for Torrid is to stay true to its mission : to serve disenfranchised customers , like Gutierrez , who want to fit in but also want to stand out .  --  With reporting by Deborah Edler Brown/Brea
