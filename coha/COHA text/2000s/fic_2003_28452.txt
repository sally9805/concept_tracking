Chapter One " Hello . What have we here ? " Princess Katianna Mirishevsky Roseanova-Krimorova , usually known as Tianna Rose , stood looking down at the man sprawled on the cushioned gazebo bench with a reluctant sense of interest . It was pretty obvious he was sleeping off the effects of a night on the town . She could n't imagine how the staff who administered to this royal residence could let such things go on . " Shoddy maintenance , " her mother would have said . This certainly would n't have been tolerated at her parents ' home . But this casual attitude seemed to be common here on the Arizona estate of the Roseanova family - the home of the exiled Royal House of the Rose . She 'd arrived at the address , dismissed her cab and gone to the entry gatehouse , only to find the gate standing wide open and no one in attendance . The estate where she 'd grown up was much more modest and low-key than this one , and yet such lax security was unheard of there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a shuttle service to take her to the main house , and now it looked like she was going to have to make the uphill climb on her own . Sighing , she started up the long driveway , only to notice the cute little gazebo overlooking a small man-made lake . She could see someone was inside so she made the detour in hopes of finding help . But it seemed she was destined to be out of luck again . The man was out like a light . Still , he was so good-looking , even in this state , that she lingered , looking him over for a moment . He looked quite comfortable lying on a sort of window seat setup equipped with plush cushions . His dark blond hair was tousled and a little too long , but his white shirt , though partially unbuttoned , was impeccable , his leather jacket expensive-looking and his slacks still had a beautiful crease . His features were strong and even , his skin smooth and tan . The slight stubble on his chin only enhanced the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gorgeous . They just did n't hire them like this where she came from - more the pity . She thought about giving him a quick shake and waking him . But no . That would n't be much use . She might as well get back on the path and make her way to the main house . Pulling her wine-colored suede jacket a little closer in the cool fall morning air , she gave one last glance at the muscular exposure of his impressive chest and turned to go . To her horror , his hand shot out and grabbed her wrist , trapping her . " Hey , Little Red Riding Hood , " he said in a voice low as a scratchy old cello . " Did n't anyone tell you it is n't safe to wander around alone in these woods ? " " Let me go ! " she ordered once she found his grasp was like steel . " Oh . " His eyes were barely slit open . " Sorry . I thought you were part of my dream . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , definitely annoyed by now . " Listen , " she began , but he was n't listening at all . " You 're sexy enough to be part of my dream , " he was musing whimsically . " And you 'll definitely be a part of my next dream . " " Make that your nightmare , " she snapped , reaching to grab his thumb and bend it backward , hard , turning into it to make a clean breakaway . " Hey ! " he said , and swore as he dropped her wrist and began to struggle to sit up . " What the - ? " But she did n't stick around to chat . Head high , she marched toward the driveway without a backward glance , silently thanking her personal defense trainer as she went . So much for those who thought princesses were sitting ducks for any passing tormentor . It was actually rather satisfying to have run across a chance to use her training . The entire incident was timely . She 'd needed a little boost to her self-esteem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . She 'd come to break her engagement to Garth Franz Josef Mikeavich Romano Roseanova , Prince of Nabotavia . She was going to have to be tough to make him understand that she was not going to marry him , no matter how many official proclamations of their betrothal he could pull out of the country 's archives . Not in a million years . The inner area of the estate was set off by a long arbor covered with winding sprays of climbing red roses , and she paused at the lovely gateway to gaze in at the spires and towers and balconies decorating the huge palatial mansion ahead , giving a little cough of amusement . " Just like an East Nabotavian prince to build himself a little Rhineland castle in the middle of Arizona , " she thought to herself . She was a West Nabotavian herself , one of a contingent of refugees who had fled the tiny Central European country twenty years before during a deadly revolution . Most had landed in the United States , living relatively good lives , working and waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now a miracle had happened and the rebels had been thrown off . Nabotavia wanted its monarchy back , and young people such as Tianna were preparing to return to a land they only knew in legends . But it was their home , their destiny . Anyway , it was supposed to be . Tianna was having trouble reconciling her own plans with this new imperative . She did n't know how Prince Garth felt about it , but she had no intention of going back . And that was one reason she meant to break their engagement off right away . A scattering of raindrops made a pattern on the walkway and she looked up at the dark clouds gathering above her in the huge Arizona sky . Somewhere not too far off , thunder crackled . Good thing she was n't too far from the house . A shout drew her attention . Some sort of a hullabaloo seemed to be going on in another area of the estate . She could hear some yelling , a man 's voice , then a woman 's higher shriek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the activity . Two large cows were munching contentedly in the vegetable garden while a number of people were dancing around them , yelling and waving hats and brooms and other implements of distraction . That solved the mystery of where the security guards must be . ( Continues ... )
