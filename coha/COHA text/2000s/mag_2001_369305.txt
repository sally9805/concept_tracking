Frank McCormick was flying home from a meeting on cancer genetics when a wild idea popped into his head . What if you could make a virus that would infect  --  and kill  --  cancer cells but leave healthy cells intact ? The next day , McCormick excitedly explained his notion to colleagues at Onyx Pharmaceuticals in Richmond , Calif. , a biotech company he had founded earlier that year . Some of them were as enthusiastic as he was . Others told him he was crazy ; such a treatment could n't possibly work . <P> Nine years later , McCormick , now director of the Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of California , San Francisco , has proof of his sanity in the form of Onyx-015 , a virus that works exactly as he envisioned . Last year the company reported results of a clinical trial in which Onyx-015 injections , in combination with chemotherapy , melted away tumors in 8 out of 30 patients with recurrent , late-stage head and neck cancer . In another study , involving 27 patients whose cancer had metastasized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 months ) , 11 were still alive nearly two years after being treated with high doses of Onyx-015 . <P> McCormick 's story is one of hundreds of similar tales coming out of laboratories and cancer wards around the world , as treatments that were little more than half-baked ideas a decade ago now enter the final stages of testing . Of some 350 new compounds and molecules being tested on cancer patients , more than half are based on innovative , sometimes bizarre-sounding ways of homing in on tumors . Hundreds more are in earlier stages of development , putting clinicians and drug companies in the novel position of having more promising cancer treatments waiting to be evaluated than they can possibly handle . <P> The new therapies are emerging from two extraordinary decades of intense basic research , a fantastic voyage that scientists have taken into the heart of the cancer cell . " The life and death of cells is being worked out , and the dozens and dozens of molecules in the body that participate in those pathways are now becoming targets for therapy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City . <P> That 's welcome news to clinicians and patients alike . Traditional cancer treatments  --  chemotherapy and radiation  --  are therapeutic blunderbusses ; they blast indiscriminately at all fast-growing cells , often destroying healthy tissue along with the tumors . By comparison , the new drugs are smart bombs ; they cause minimal collateral damage and trigger relatively few side effects . <P> Many of the new therapies also happen to be incredibly potent . Last month , for example , pharmaceutical giant Novartis reported spectacular results in a clinical trial of Glivec , a drug that disables a uniquely aberrant protein produced inside cells of chronic myelogenous leukemia , which afflicts 4,400 new patients in the U.S. each year . In the drug 's very first test , every patient went into remission . In the most recent results , 30% showed no sign of the chromosomal damage that marks the disease and appeared to have been cured . " This drug is amazing , " says Richard Stone , an oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute who has been testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transduction inhibitor ) . " Even patients who are near death , at the end stage of this disease , are going into remission . "
