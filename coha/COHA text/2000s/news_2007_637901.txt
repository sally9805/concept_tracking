<p> WHITECLAY , Neb.  --  The Jumping Eagle Inn , one of four stores selling beer here on the border of South Dakota 's Pine Ridge Indian Reservation , is hopping . Several customers spend $19.50 for a carton of 30 beers . Then they drive north toward the reservation , where alcohol is banned . <p> Some customers buy one beer at a time and spend their days and nights in this unincorporated town of 14 . At7:55 a.m. on a recent weekday , a dozen men are waiting for the Jumping Eagle to open . By 8:10 a.m. , they 're drinking from silver cans . Others hang out in vacant buildings or panhandle outside the two grocery stores . A man sleeps on a sidewalk , flies swarming around his face . <p> The stores here sell the equivalent of about 10,000 cans of beer daily , according to the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission . Much of the beer  --  the stores do n't sell hard liquor  --  makes its way onto the reservation . Some tribal leaders are infuriated by the stores ' proximity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to close the stores and plan to ask the Nebraska Legislature again next year to curtail the sale of alcohol to a population wracked by alcoholism . <p> Legal vs. ' moral ' issue <p> The situation in Whiteclay is " gut-wrenching , " says Indian activist Russell Means . " I do n't even like to drive through it because I see my people suffering . I cry . " Six people , including Means , were arrested last month when they blockaded the road between here and Pine Ridge and tried to search vehicles for beer . <p> " I 've never considered myself a bad guy , " says Stuart Kozal , 48 , a part-owner of the Jumping Eagle . He 's a businessman who obeys the law , he says . He interrupts a conversation to tell an inebriated man who wants to buy a beer , " No , you 've had too many , buddy . " <p> It 's illegal to sell alcohol to anyone visibly intoxicated or underage . Consumption on store property and sales on credit are prohibited . Hobert Rupe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says liquor licenses ca n't be revoked without proof of violations of the regulations . <p> " The licensees are acting in conformance with the law as far as we can tell , " he says . If Whiteclay 's stores were closed , he asks , " Would you stop alcohol abuse ? Unfortunately , no . ... You just shift the problem to other places . " Rupe says the commission supports stronger law enforcement in Whiteclay . <p> Kozal says he 'd consider closing his store " if I honestly thought that doing away with Whiteclay would do away with the problem on the reservation with alcohol . " It would n't , he says . " It 's got to come from within the person . " <p> Tom Poor Bear , 51 , a tribal council member , agrees that the Oglala Sioux people are responsible for their alcohol problems . " Alcohol has weakened my people . Believe me , I know the pain of alcohol because I have tasted the alcohol and I 've felt the weakness , " he says . <p> However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility because they are taking advantage of " people who have to live in a poverty-stricken area . Hope has been drained from them . " <p> The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation is home to about 20,000 people . More than half live under the poverty line , and the tribal government says the unemployment rate exceeds 80% . Suicide , infant mortality and fetal alcohol syndrome rates are high . In 2006 , Shannon County , which is part of the reservation , had South Dakota 's highest number of alcohol-related traffic fatalities . <p> Kozal and others here say closing the beer stores would not end those problems . <p> " They 'll just go somewhere else , " says Mary Eckholt , 79 , who has lived here for almost 50 years and runs a gift shop . Banning alcohol does n't make sense , she says . " The whole country tried it once with Prohibition , and it did n't work . " <p> Bruce BonFleur , 55 , who runs a ministry in Whiteclay , says solving the problems here will require " moral leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The battle over Whiteclay has prompted years of marches , protests and efforts to persuade the Nebraska Legislature to close the stores or reduce the number of licenses . Legislation that would tighten liquor laws has never made it out of committee . <p> Mark Vasina , president of Nebraskans for Peace , a social justice group that supported the blockade and lobbies the Legislature , says another attempt to pass a Whiteclay bill will be made next year . <p> " If what goes on in Whiteclay went on in downtown Lincoln , there would be community outcry and something would be done about it in a very short time , " he says . <p> Poor Bear and others say Whiteclay was part of the reservation in the 1880s and should be returned . He also blames Whiteclay for the unsolved 1999 murders of two tribe members whose bodies were found just across the state line in South Dakota . <p> For some tribal leaders , Whiteclay is a symbol of their neighbors ' indifference to the reservation 's problems , says Frank LaMere , an activist from Nebraska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood on our hands , " says LaMere , 57 , who was arrested during the blockade . " I am growing impatient with those who refuse to see the death and destruction we have wrought on Pine Ridge . ... The next time I get arrested , it 's going to be at the Nebraska State Capitol . " <p> Duane Martin Sr. , a Pine Ridge activist who heads the Strong Hearts Civil Rights Movement , plans more blockades . " We have to open up the eyes of the world to the devastation here , " he says . <p> Loren Black Elk , 47 , whose brother Wilson Black Elk was one of the 1999 murder victims , acknowledges that he drinks and spends time on the streets of Whiteclay . He does n't think closing the stores would make any difference . " You ca n't stop alcohol , " he says . <p> The following fields overflowed : <p> OBJECT = areservation17 A03RESERVATION17.jpg.117 A03RESERVATION17.jpg17 <p> PHOTO , B/W , Seth A.
