A Hat Full of Sky Chapter One Leaving It came crackling over the hills , like an invisible fog . Movement without a body tired it , and it drifted very slowly . It was n't thinking now . It had been months since it had last thought , because the brain that was doing the thinking for it had died . They always died . So now it was naked again , and frightened . It could hide in one of the blobby white creatures that baa 'd nervously as it crawled over the turf . But they had useless brains , capable of thinking only about grass and making other things that went baa . No . They would not do . It needed , needed something better , a strong mind , a mind with power , a mind that could keep it safe . It searched . . . . The new boots were all wrong . They were stiff and shiny . Shiny boots ! That was disgraceful . Clean boots , that was different . There was nothing wrong with putting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . But boots had to work for a living . They should n't shine . Tiffany Aching , standing on the rug in her bedroom , shook her head . She 'd have to scuff the things as soon as possible . Then there was the new straw hat , with a ribbon on it . She had some doubts about that , too . She tried to look at herself in the mirror , which was n't easy because the mirror was not much bigger than her hand , and cracked and blotchy . She had to move it around to try and see as much of herself as possible and remember how the bits fitted together . But today . . . well , she did n't usually do this sort of thing in the house , but it was important to look smart today , and since no one was around . . . She put the mirror down on the rickety table by the bed , stood in the middle of the threadbare rug , shut her eyes , and said : " See me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no body and no mind but a terrible hunger and a bottomless fear , felt the power . It would have sniffed the air if it had a nose . It searched . It found . Such a strange mind , like a lot of minds inside one another , getting smaller and smaller ! So strong ! So close ! It changed direction slightly and went a little faster . As it moved , it made a noise like a swarm of flies . The sheep , nervous for a moment about something they could n't see or smell , baa 'd . . . . . . and went back to chewing grass . Tiffany opened her eyes . There she was , a few feet away from herself . She could see the back of her own head . Carefully , she moved around the room , not looking down at the " her " that was moving , because she found that if she did that , then the trick was over . It was quite difficult , moving like that , but at last she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Brown hair to match brown eyes . . . well , there was nothing she could do about that . At least her hair was clean and she 'd washed her face . She had a new dress on , which improved things a bit . It was so unusual to buy new clothes in the Aching family that , of course , it was bought big so that she 'd " grow into it . " But at least it was pale green , and it did n't actually touch the floor . With the shiny new boots and the straw hat she looked . . . like a farmer 's daughter , quite respectable , going off to her first job . It 'd have to do . From here she could see the pointy hat on her head , but she had to look hard for it . It was like a glint in the air , gone as soon as you saw it . That 's why she 'd been worried about the new straw hat , but it had simply gone through the pointy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , in a way , it was n't . It was invisible , except in the rain . Sun and wind went straight through , but rain and snow somehow saw it , and treated it as if it was real . She 'd been given it by the greatest witch in the world , a real witch with a black dress and a black hat and eyes that could go through you like turpentine goes through a sick sheep . It had been a kind of reward . Tiffany had done magic , serious magic . Before she had done it she had n't known that she could , when she had been doing it she had n't known that she was , and after she had done it she had n't known how she had . Now she had to learn how . " See me not , " she said . The vision of her  --  or whatever it was , because she was not exactly sure about this trick  --  vanished . It had been a shock , the first time she 'd done this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least in her head . All her memories were like little pictures of herself doing things or watching things , rather than the view from the two holes in the front of her head . There was a part of her that was always watching her . Miss Tick  --  another witch , but one who was easier to talk to than the witch who 'd given Tiffany the hat  --  had said that a witch had to know how to " stand apart , " and that she 'd find out more when her talent grew , so Tiffany supposed the " see me " was part of this . Sometimes Tiffany thought she ought to talk to Miss Tick about " see me . " It felt as if she was stepping out of her body but still had a sort of ghost body that could walk around . It all worked as long as her ghost eyes did n't look down and see that she was just a ghost body . If that happened , some part of her panicked and she found herself back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , decided to keep this to herself . You did n't have to tell a teacher everything . Anyway , it was a good trick for when you did n't have a mirror .
