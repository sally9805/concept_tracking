TWO YEARS AGO , when we made our first attempt to cover charitable giving in a serious and ongoing way , we devoted forty-five pages to the subject . Last year we gave over the entire feature well , plus some regular departments . Now , in this issue , virtually every editorial page has something to do with the power of philanthropy . And what power that pursuit possesses . No question about it , philanthropists can save lives , build schools , clean up the environment , preserve the land , protect wildlife , advance medical research , elevate the arts , ease pain and suffering , feed and house the homeless and administer to the disabled and the elderly . And that 's just for starters . Photograph : With Luke Bailes , Singita 's CEO . Photograph by Maura McEvoy Philanthropists are , for the most part , affluent individuals who have not only the wherewithal but also the sheer force of will to make things happen . Because of them , others can follow . Some are well-known , like the plainspoken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of careful consideration ( arousing much speculation ) , finally decided to pledge ten million shares of Berkshire Hathaway stock ( worth $31 billion at the time ) to the Bill &; Melinda Gates Foundation . Coals to Newcastle ? I do n't think so , not when Buffett 's money will go toward furthering the foundation 's tremendous work in helping American schools and toward promoting global health and development . Not everyone who donates money and does good work is either rich or famous . Many charitable givers do so without fanfare . They do n't expect a building to be named after them or a statue erected in their honor . Some donors give anonymously , avoiding attention completely . Then there are those unselfish souls who amassed fortunes that no one ever even knew about and who may have decided to give them all away to alma maters , hospitals or whatever causes sparked an interest . Their gifts come out of nowhere . Well , that 's not exactly true : they come straight from the heart . I consider these men and women the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they prefer it . It 's a little like " stealth wealth "  --  if you know your own worth and what it can do , there 's no need to flaunt it . Some of the most important and biggest stories we 've published on philanthropy have been about the wreckage , both physical and psychological , in the wake of natural disasters . In 2005 I went on a UNICEF-sponsored trip to Sri Lanka to see the devastating effects of the tsunami on the people of that country . Last year I visited post-Katrina New Orleans . On both assignments I traveled with photographer Maura McEvoy . And in both instances the articles ran many pages longer than planned  --  not because of my reporting but because Maura 's photos were so illuminating that they deserved more space . It happened again this time around . In February we went to the Singita Grumeti Reserves , a private concession and a major conservation effort located in Tanzania , just west of Serengeti National Park . The story here ( page 138 ) is not about the aftereffects of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from happening in the first place . Maura surrendered herself completely to her surroundings from the moment we arrived , so much so that I 've taken to calling her Masai Maura . I remember one particularly beautiful day of game viewing at Singita Grumeti . Maura , who 'd never been to East Africa before , sat in the back of our Land Rover , absolutely transfixed by what she was observing  --  herds of impalas and zebras , a family of cheetahs , giraffes gathering on the plains , hundreds of elephants of all sizes ambling through the high grass and toppling trees as they foraged for food . At one point she murmured in disbelief , " To think that after just five days , we 'll have something to remember for the rest of our lives . " She was reading my mind . Our companion on the trip was Luke Bailes , the CEO of the South African luxury-lodge company known as Singita . It is based in Cape Town , but its four camps are located in and near Kruger National Park . Singita Grumeti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a low-key but highly successful American hedge-fund manager , Paul Tudor Jones II , who is , among other things , a devoted conservationist . The more Luke told me about Singita Grumeti , the more I realized that it is a tale in three equal parts : tourism , conservation and community development . Most important is that all of the money raised from the three lodges on the reserves  --  Sasakwa Lodge , Sabora Plains Tented Camp and Faru Faru River Lodge  --  goes directly back into wildlife management and to the nineteen villages along the property 's western border . Not a penny is for profit . It 's a little too soon to know if this great experiment will meet all of its goals , but the expectations and the standards of both Luke Bailes and Paul Tudor Jones are high , so keep your eye on it . Better still , go to Singita Grumeti , and see it for yourself . You 'll be helping the effort if you do , and you 'll have the experience of a lifetime in the process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charity featured in this issue ?
