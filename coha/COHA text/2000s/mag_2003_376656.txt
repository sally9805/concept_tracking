It 's the same old story , a fight for love and ... hmm ... self-discipline ? Self-realization ? The getting of wisdom ? Something like that . <P> When we meet Tom Cruise 's Captain Nathan Algren in 1876 , he 's a wreck , drinking heavily to drown his memories of massacring Indians on the American frontier , lost in despairing cynicism . Then he 's recruited to help train a modern army in Japan , the chief function of which is to put down a samurai rebellion against the new , dishonorable , Westernizing ways that his army symbolizes . In the first , brilliantly staged fight , Algren is captured by the samurai and sequestered for a long winter in their remote village , where there 's nothing much to do but learn the harsh yet entirely admirable samurai code . <P> His particular instructor is Katsumoto ( Ken Watanabe ) , the samurai leader , who recognizes in Algren something of the warrior stuff . The American is not afraid of death . What has to be burned out of him is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Algren and the widow of a man he killed ( the Japanese model turned actress Koyuki ) fall shyly into unspoken love . <P> It 's easy to stand back and wax ironic about The Last Samurai . But it 's not all that difficult to succumb to its full-spirited romanticism either . The director , Edward Zwick , whose Glory is one of the rare , recent triumphs among grand historical tales , has obviously studied his Kurosawa . Working on the script with Marshall Herskovitz and John Logan , Zwick brings the master 's concentrated fury to his depictions of hand-to-hand combat ; a certain raw , muddy brutality to Cruise 's training for those moments ; and both epic sweep and powerful detail to the big battles . By way of contrast , there is a handsome geometric austerity to the way Zwick and his director of photography , John Toll , show court life and intimate life in a Japan trembling on the brink of modernity . <P> In the end , the samurai  --  whose honor demands that they fight only with swords , bows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gatling guns . It 's a great set piece , both militarily and cinematically , and one that allows us to mix shreds of hope with our doomy forebodings . And , indeed , a moral victory  --  of the kind that does n't necessarily count in the win column  --  is achieved . <P> The Last Samurai is a movie that demands our surrender  --  to its energy , to its bold-stroke moviemaking , to its acting ( particularly by Cruise and Watanabe , who blend musing and graceful muscularity ) and , above all , to its romantic vision of a lost world . You have to rationalize its commitment to the warrior values that , nostalgized and bastardized , would help make Japan such a cruel and dangerous player on the world stage less than a century later . But because the movie 's business is to celebrate those values in uncorrupted form , viewers can probably silence such concerns . <P> What makes this film riskier than Braveheart or Gladiator , each of which did well commercially by anachronistically having its heroes fight and die for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battling for something that is somehow more personal and more abstract : a highly individual concept of honor . In the context of this very beautiful film , it is a struggle worth attending .  --  By Richard Schickel
