1 Bermuda , present day <p> War and peace . In Alexander Hawke 's experience , life usually boiled down to one or the other . Like his namesake late father , a hero much decorated for his daring Cold War exploits against the Soviets , Hawke greatly favored peace but was notoriously adept at war . Whenever and wherever in the world his rather exotic skill set was required , Alex Hawke gladly sallied forth . Cloak donned , dagger to hand , he would jubilantly enter and reenter the eternal fray . <p> He was thirty-three years old . A good age , by his accounts , not too young and not too old . A fine balance of youth and experience , if one could be so bold . <p> Alex Hawke , let it first be said , was a creature of radiant violence . Attack came naturally to him ; the man was all fire . Shortly after his squalling birth , his very English father had declared to Kitty , his equally American mother , " He seems to me a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only wonder what ballast will balance all that bloody sail . " <p> He was normally a cool , rather detached character , but Alex Hawke 's simmering blood could roil to a rapid boil at very short notice . Oddly enough , his true nature was not readily apparent to the casual observer . Someone who chanced to meet him , say , on an evening 's stroll through Berkeley Square would find him an amiable , even jolly chap . He might even be whistling a chirrupy tune about nightingales or some such . There was an easy grace about the man , a cheery nonchalance , a faint look of amusement uncorrupted by self-satisfaction about the eyes . <p> But it was Hawke 's " What the hell " grin , a look so freighted with charm that no woman , and even few men , could resist , that made him who he was . <p> Hawke was noticeable . A big man with a heroic head , he stood well north of six feet and worked hard at a strict exercise regimen to keep himself extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply etched by the myriad wonders and doubts of his inner experience . <p> His glacial blue eyes were brilliant , and the play of his expression had a flashing range , from the merriment and charm with which he charged his daily conversation to a profound earnestness . His demeanor quickly could assume a tragic and powerful look , which could make even a trivial topic suddenly assume new and enlightening importance . <p> He had a full head of rather untamable jet-black hair , a high , clear brow , and a straight , imperious nose . Below it was a strong chin and a well-sculpted mouth with just a hint of come-hither cruelty at the corners . <p> Picture a hale fellow well met whom men wanted to stand a drink and whom women much preferred horizontal . <br> <p> He 'd been dozing on a pristine Bermuda beach for the better part of an hour . It was a hot day , a day that was shot blue all through . The fluttering eyelids and the thin smile on Hawke 's salt-parched lips belied the rather exotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above , perhaps the dolphinlike clicking of a long-tailed petrel , startled him from his reverie . He cracked one eye , then the other , smiling at the fleeting memory of sexual bliss still imprinted on the back of his mind . <p> Erotic images , fleshy nymphs of pink and creamy white , fled quickly as he raised his head and peered alertly at the brightness of the real world through two fiercely narrowed blue eyes . Just inside the reef line , a white sail shivered and flipped to leeward . As he watched the graceful little Bermuda sloop , the sail turned to windward again , and from across the water he distinctly heard a sound he loved , the ruffle and snap of canvas . <p> No question about this time and place in his life , he thought , gazing at the gently lapping surf : my blue heaven . <p> Here on this sunlit mid-Atlantic isle , peace abounded . These , finally , were the " blue days " he had longed for . His most recent " red " period , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armies of Hezbollah jihadistas deep in the Amazon , was mercifully fading from memory . Every new blue day pushed those fearful memories deeper into the depths of his consciousness , and for that he was truly grateful . <p> He rolled over easily onto his back . The sugary sand , like pinkish talc , was warm beneath his bare skin . He must have drifted off after his most recent swim . Hmm . He linked his hands behind his still damp head and breathed deeply , the fresh salt air filling his lungs . <p> The sun was still high in the azure Bermuda sky . <p> He lifted his arm to gaze lazily at his dive watch . It was just after two o'clock in the afternoon . A smile flitted across his lips as he contemplated the remainder of the day 's schedule . He had nothing on this evening save a quiet dinner with his closest friend , Ambrose Congreve , and Congreve 's fiancTe , Diana Mars , at eight . He licked the dried salt from his lips , closed his eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His refuge was a small cove of crystalline turquoise water . Wavelets slid up and over dappled pinkish sand before retreating to regroup and charge once more . This tiny bay , perhaps a hundred yards across at its mouth , was invisible from the coast road . The South Road , as it was called , had been carved into the jagged coral and limestone centuries earlier and extended all the way along the coast to Somerset and the Royal Naval Dockyard . <p> Fringed with flourishing green mangrove and sea-grape , Hawke 's little crescent of paradise was indistinguishable from countless coves just like it stretching east and west along the southern coast of Bermuda . The only access was from the sea . After months of visiting the cove undisturbed , he 'd begun to think of the spot as his own . He 'd even nicknamed it " Bloody Bay " because he was usually so bloody exhausted when he arrived there after a 3-mile swim . <p> Hawke had chosen Bermuda carefully . He saw it as an ideal spot to nurse his wounds and heal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equidistant between his twin capitals of London and Washington , Bermuda was quaintly civilized , featured balmy weather and a happy-go-lucky population , and it was somewhere few of his acquaintances , friend or foe , would ever think to look for him . <p> In the year before , his bout of nasty scrapes in the Amazon jungles had included skirmishes with various tropical fevers that had nearly taken his life . But after six idyllic months of marinating in this tropic sea and air , he concluded that he 'd never felt better in his life . Even with a modest daily intake of Mr. Gosling 's elixir , called by the natives black rum , he had somehow gotten his six-foot-plus frame down to his fighting weight of 180 . He now had a deep tan and a flat belly , and he felt just fine . In his early thirties , he felt twenty if a day . <p> Hawke had taken refuge in a small , somewhat dilapidated beach cottage . The old house , originally a sugar mill , was perched , some might say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his current location . He had gotten into the very healthy habit of swimming to this isolated beach every day . Three miles twice daily was not excessive and not a bad addition to his normal workout routine , which included a few hundred situps and pullups , not to mention serious weight training . <p> His privacy thus ensured , his habit at his private beach was to shed his swimsuit once he 'd arrived . He 'd made a ritual of stripping it off and hanging it on a nearby mangrove branch . Then a few hours sunning au naturel , as our French cousins would have it . He was normally a modest man , but the luxuriant feeling of cool air and sunlight on parts not normally exposed was too delightful to be denied . He 'd gotten so accustomed to this new regime that the merest idea of wearing trunks here would seem superfluous , ridiculous even . And  --  what ? <p> He stared with disbelieving eyes . <p> What the bloody hell was that ? Copyright 2008 by Theodore A. Bell <br> Continues ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
