The tepid random of Washingtonians . <p> If you grew up in Michigan in the 1980s , as I did , you pretty much had to be a Detroit Pistons fan . It was the era of Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars , when the team 's physical style of play earned it the sobriquet " Bad Boys " and the disdain of most everyone else in the country . But we loved them , and we watched the playoffs everywhere  --  even at Girls State one year , several hundred high school girls crowded into a dorm rec room to witness the Pistons ' second consecutive NBA title . <p> The sports culture that I found when I arrived in Washington , D.C. more than a decade ago could n't have been more different . The local NBA team  --  then known as the Washington Bullets  --  starred two former Michigan players , which was enough to make me a fan . But they mostly lost , and this , I figured , explained why I never seemed to run across any other Bullet fans around town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wizards are one of the most exciting teams in the NBA , a perennial playoff contender . They are led by the charismatic guard Gilbert Arenas , whose quirks ( he plays in lowtop sneakers and spends halftimes immersed in online poker ) and skills ( he is the league 's fourth top scorer ) should make him an appealing superstar . So where 's the excitement ? <p> If you walked around downtown Washington this spring , you 'd have found virtually no sign that the Wizards were in the playoffs  --  no Wizards pennants in store windows , no overheard conversations in coffee shops about last night 's winning three-pointer . When I talked to friends  --  most of them , like me , transplants from other cities  --  about the Wizards , the typical reaction was " Oh yeah , they 're in the playoffs , are n't they ? " They , not we . <p> At the games themselves , fans do n't even fill the arena . Indeed , an embarrassing number who do show up root quite openly for the other side . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public display of disloyalty is so prevalent  --  and so tolerated . <p> Since sports random is at least partly about identity , about pride of place , what does it mean that so many people who live in Washington dismiss the home team ? Certainly , the fact that a major portion of the local population was born elsewhere has something to do with it . " We 're immigrants , with loyalties to the old country , " explains Marshall Wittman of the Democratic Leadership Council , a former Texan and 26-year DC-area resident who still roots for the Cowboys . <p> But other cities absorb large numbers of outsiders and still manage to generate pride and unity among their residents . Part of becoming a New Yorker or Chicagoan is adapting to the local culture , adopting the Yankees or Cubs ( or Mets or White Sox ) . <p> In Washington , however , the immigrants do n't assimilate . That 's a big reason why the city , despite its size and power , feels so artificial . It 's like one giant hotel where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the length of an administration , sometimes for decades , but almost always with some intention of leaving . <p> It did n't always used to be this way . Forty years ago ( so I 'm told ) , Washington had its own unique and proud identity . The Kennedys made public service seem noble , and living in D.C. seem glamorous . But at a certain point  --  some mark 1994 as the pivotal year  --  it became uncool to identity oneself as a Washingtonian . In this anti-Washington age , childhood sports allegiances have become political statements : Professing an undying loyalty to the St. Louis Cardinals telegraphs that you are not an inside-the-Beltway elitist , but someone firmly rooted in heartland values . To admit that you are a Washington sports fan is afaux pas akin to confessing that you spend your evenings at Georgetown cocktail parties . A quarter of a century ago , Richard Nixon was happy to be known as a rabid Redskins fan . Today , George W. Bush , perhaps rightly , sees no political benefit in publicly rooting for Washington sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conundrum by declaring Washington teams their " default " option . For the past ten years , for instance , I 've rooted for the Wizards whenever they were n't playing the Pistons . But that 's a half-hearted , anemic kind of fandom , and I 've felt vaguely uneasy about it for a while . This spring , at a Pistons-Wizards game , the tension became too much . <p> The ostensibly hometown crowd inside the Verizon Center was a sea of Detroit jerseys and teenagers screaming " ' Sheed ! " every time Detroit power forward Rasheed Wallace ran down the court . Somewhere around the fourth time the girl in front of me  --  a Georgetown student with long manicured nails and a Ben Wallace jersey on  --  jumped up to scream " You suck , Wizards ! " I snapped . " Oh , shut up , " I muttered , maybe a little too loudly . By the time the Wizards handed an 18-point drubbing to the Pistons , my conflicted self was a fleeting memory . I was too busy high-riving my neighbors as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may be a Michigan girl , but I 'm a Washingtonian now . It 's my political statement , abandoning my old identity and accepting the new . If we Washingtonians have any pride  --  in who we are and in what we do here  --  we 'll root for the home team . Especially when it 's winning . Boehner 's Bar Tab <p> Since taking over from Tom DeLay as House majority leader , Rep. John Boehner ( R-Ohio ) has made some faint murmurs about cleaning up Washington 's dollar-driven political culture . But a quick survey of the party schedule for Boehner 's political action committee , juxtaposed with the Congressman 's voting record , suggests he may not be the best man for that job . <p> 2/14/02 : Boehner votes against campaign finance reform legislation . <p> 2/20/02 : His PAC spends S7314 at SheUy 's Backroom and two other capital watering holes . <p> Drowning his sorrows at the bill 's passage ? <p> 4/18/02 : Votes to make the Bush tax cuts permanent . <p> 5/31/02 : Spends $1795 at Sam and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S5407 , back at Sam and Harry 's . <p> 7/25/02 : Spends 58496 at the Belmont Country Club , Ashburn , Va . <p> Those tax cuts sure stimulated the local economy . <p> 5/8/03 : Spends $5705 at Polly Esther 's , Washington 's 80s-themed dance club . <p> 5/9/03 : Votes to increase the amount businesses can write off their taxes . <p> Maybe he was hung over . <p> 9/26/05 : Spends S5700 at the Hyde Park Chop House , Dublin , Ohio . <p> 9/29/05 : Votes to gut the Endangered Species Act . <p> Guess he liked that elk chop . <p> 12/8/05 : Votes to extend more Bush tax cuts . <p> 12/15/05 : Spends $11,220 at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club , Lake Manassas , Va . <p> Tax cuts + golf = bliss !
