a " public-private partnership " under which the government would recapitalize ailing institutions to bolster the financial sector , a crucial step for the economic recovery . <p> Bernanke , amplifying comments this month by Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner , says the plan does n't mean nationalizing the nation 's biggest banks . But others are n't so sure that the government has n't already moved in that direction . <p> " It 's a form of creeping nationalization , " says Sen. Bob Corker , R-Tenn . <p> That might not be such a bad idea , others say . <p> " You have to go in there , take over giant institutions that are in trouble , and clean them up , " says Paul Miller of FBR Capital Markets . <p> A big part of the discussion depends on what " nationalization " means . In the strictest sense , the government routinely nationalizes banks when they fail , as it did with IndyMac Bank last year , which cost the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . $8.9 billion . And if the government chooses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it also would get voting rights as a shareholder . In some cases , the government could be the majority shareholder  --  in effect , controlling the company . <p> To date , the Treasury has spent $196 billion to buy preferred bank stock in its Troubled Asset Relief Program , while spending billions more for American International Group and auto lenders . The Federal Reserve has vastly increased its lending facilities , including the Term Auction Facility , which offers $150 billion in secured loans to banks per auction . <p> The stock market  --  and bank stocks particularly  --  rallied sharply on Bernanke ' s description , with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 236 points Tuesday . <p> The plan entails close scrutiny of the nation 's 19 largest financial institutions , propping them up , and hoping to recoup taxpayer money when they return to health . It 's a big , complex undertaking , and the health of the financial system depends on it . <p> " If we do n't stabilize the financial system , we 're going to founder for some time , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take more than the $700 billion that Congress set aside last year , President Obama warned in his speech Tuesday night . <p> " I can assure you that the cost of inaction will be far greater , for it could result in an economy that sputters along for not months or years , but perhaps a decade . That would be worse for our deficit , worse for business , worse for you <p> The plan <p> How will the government stabilize the banking system ? Normally , when a bank fails , the government has two options . <p> In most cases , it arranges a merger with a healthy bank , sometimes taking the bank 's worst loans and riskiest assets to make the merger more attractive . Sometimes , however , the government liquidates the bank outright , wiping out shareholders and paying off insured depositors . So far this year , 14 banks have failed , but only one has been an outright liquidation . <p> Many of the banks currently under scrutiny , however , have huge deposit bases , so an outright liquidation would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions are in the market to buy vast , troubled banks . These 19 banks have more than $5 trillion in assets combined , according to Institutional Risk Analytics , and any failures could have serious economic consequences . <p> The government 's plan for the largest , most troubled institutions has three major steps : <p> *Stress test . Although the Treasury has yet to reveal the details of its stress test , it 's clear that the government will take a hard look at the financial health of the 19 largest banks to see if they can n't be to issue a pass-or-fail grade . Instead , regulators will determine how much capital each bank needs from the government , if any , to give them a cushion while they restructure . <p> *Recapitalization . In many cases , the Treasury will get preferred or convertible preferred stock for the money it gives to banks . These shares typically do n't have voting rights , possibly to give more of a hands-off appearance to the government , says Jerry Webman , chief economist for Oppenheimer Funds . In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Typically , common stock gets wiped out before preferred stock does , so this would give the government  --  and taxpayers  --  more protection in case of a meltdown . <p> *Exit . Eventually , when troubled banks are strong enough to operate without help , they can repay the government and raise private capital . " That 's the end game , " Bernanke said . " When private money will start coming back in . And I 'm sure it will happen . The sooner , the better . " There 's no guarantee , but in a best-case scenario , the government could make money on its investments . <p> Is this nationalization ? <p> Critics of the government 's plan charge that so . Bernanke went to great lengths to assure lawmakers that the Fed was n't , in fact , planning on doing that . <p> " It 's not nationalization , because the banks would not be wholly owned or probably not even majority owned by the government , " he told the Senate Banking Committee . " The government will be a shareholder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , the government has plenty of regulatory powers over banks without exercising a vote in corporate meetings . <p> Skeptics abound . <p> Sen. Corker , for example , does n't think that the Fed should say that liquidation is not an option . " There are lots of unintended consequences when you say upfront that the public will provide any and all capital necessary to keep them afloat , " he says . " It 's difficult to imagine a scenario where private-sector money returns to those institutions . " <p> And Miller thinks that more forceful action might be needed . One proposal is a good bank/bad bank plan , in which the government would take over a bank , retain its toxic assets for later disposal , and sell off the good parts of the bank . Under that scenario , however , taxpayers would get very little return on their money , if any . " The people would end up with the bad bank , " he says . <p> Outright nationalization might not be the worst thing for the most stressed banks , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economics blog RGE Monitor , calls bank takeovers the " most efficient way of cleaning up the mess in the credit markets . " <p> And despite the government 's hesitance to nationalize banks , if it ends up holding a majority stake in Citigroup , for example , it will effectively have taken over the bank , Menegatti adds . <p> Citigroup , the third-largest bank by assets , is in talks with the government about increasing its stake in the bank . The government already holds $45 billion of preferred shares and has agreed to share losses on $301 billion of troubled bank assets . <p> But one option now being discussed involves converting some of the government 's preferred shares in Citigroup to common stock . This action would boost a key measure of Citigroup 's financial health and could give the government the largest single stake in the bank . <p> At least for now , the government 's caution seems to be appreciated on Wall Street . Stocks of major banks soared Tuesday . Citigroup was up 21.5% , or 46 cents , to $2.60 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government 's actions have prevented another run on the bank , as when IndyMac collapsed . <p> After all , the world does n't end with Citigroup stock below $5 a share . " The real meltdown is when depositors wo n't keep money in the bank , " Webman says . <p> Contributing : Kathy Chu <p> Find Documents with Similar Topics Help Below are concepts discussed in this document .
