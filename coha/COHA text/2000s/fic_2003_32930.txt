At this early hour on a Saturday morning , auto traffic moved smoothly along Third Street , slowing only momentarily at the site of the police activity . The block was devoid of pedestrians . She walked past a liquor store occupying the corner of Harper , its vertical neon sign reflecting down the two intersecting streets . Then came Indigo Restaurant , Minassian Rug Company , a Christian Science Reading Room , John Atchison Beauty Shop , a laundry . Then Tradition . The mid-block restaurant , its taped-off perimeter patrolled by Felix Knapp and Chris Hollings , was scarcely wider than a storefront . Kate nodded to the twoofficers , pleased with the positioning of police tape which would help to keep media coverage well back from the crime scene . Taylor ducked under the tape ; Kate moved past it and looked in the window of the adjacent business , Andria 's Hole in the Wall - a contemporary clothing shop with garments in its window that she would not wear to a Halloween party . Next came Mariana Custom Cleaners . Then a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a mini-mall with a half-dozen shops . Across the street a 7-Eleven dominated a matching mini-mall . The next building was Taj Soundworks , then a vacant storefront , a shop called Objects , Pacific Printing , Classy Nail , a yoga center , and Banner Packing . After recording all of this in her notebook , Kate walked back to Tradition and past the tape to study the restaurant . White shutters decorated the lower half of the front window , tapestry curtains the top half . A small puff-shaped canopy , dark blue , sheltered a door , the window in the door decorated by tapestry matching the curtain in the larger window . Sergeant Fred Hansen , with Taylor beside him smothering another yawn , stood sentry in the doorway , watching her , one hand resting on his gun belt , the other clutching a clipboard . She nodded . " Morning , Fred . " Hansen returned her nod . " How are you , Kate ? " Somberly , he consulted his clipboard . " Victim 's Edward Ashwell Crawford , white male , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He gestured behind him . " Nice little neighborhood restaurant with takeout , catering , too . " His stolid expression softened . " Nice little business . Would n't mind having it myself . " The softness was replaced by impassiveness . " Except for what 's in the kitchen . Real scenic in there . His partner slid all over the place getting to the victim to see if he was still alive . " " Great , " muttered Taylor . He unbuttoned his plaid jacket , tugged on its sleeves , shoved his hands in his pockets . Kate recognized Taylor 's fidgeting as preparation , a bracing for what awaited them . " Anything else ? " she said to Hansen with a brusqueness that came out of her own tension , a familiar tightening inside her , a necessary girding . Hansen shook his head . " The partner 's too freaked out , could n't get much out of him . " He gestured to a black-and-white parked off to the side of the yellow police tape ; a figure sat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pierce and Swenson , Foster and Deems are canvassing but everything on the street 's closed except the 7-Eleven . There 's an alley behind the restaurant , we 're working the neighborhood over there . The victim 's been dead a few hours , I 'd say . Some of the mess is drying . " " Thanks , Fred , " Kate said . Hansen opened the door of Tradition . A counter with an old-fashioned ornate cash register occupied the front of the long room . A refrigerator display case along the adjacent wall was empty of its usual contents , but neat tags in script lettering announced what had been planned for the case : lemon pasta with herbs , grape leaves , chicken breasts dijon , shrimp salad , vegetable bouquet . Visible in the murky depths of the room were eight small tables on a faded Oriental carpet , with tablecloths and delicate wrought iron chairs with tapestry-covered seats . On the walls three impressionist prints of nature scenes seemed dream-like in the shadows . Taylor , glancing around , scratched the bald spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blond hair back over it . " Very frou-frou , " he pronounced . Kate liked the place , its gentility amid the prosaic commerce of the street . She suspected that it attracted loyal customers who appreciated the unpretentious charm . She moved to the counter and stooped down to read a card in a small wicker basket . TRADITION Catering for the Discriminating She stood up straight . Squaring her shoulders , she walked toward the doorway behind the counter . Standing on the threshold she took in the scene in one encompassing glance that included the ceiling , then carefully focused her gaze . The kitchen was compact , with a double stainless steel sink and Formica-topped counters , a built-in refrigerator - all surrounding a large table for food preparation . Immaculate , Kate thought . She would trust anything prepared in here . She lowered her gaze slightly , examining the room in patterned sections like a camera lens . The cabinet and walls were pristine white , except for a considerable area near the sink where a design of bright red arcs and splatters extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall was a smear of red as if a hand had swiped at the stain . " This guy ca n't have an ounce left in him , " Taylor grunted from behind her in the doorway . She lowered her gaze to the polished tile floor . Blood had pooled into the channels between the white tiles for several feet around the body of Edward Ashwell Crawford . Other individual puddles and trails of blood defiled the floor , as well as bloody footsteps , several of them skid marks where someone had slid through the gore . The dead man 's black pants clung wetly to his legs . Patches of white skin were visible through a torn and shredded shirt fouled crimson and plastered to his body ; only from a portion of the collar could Kate tell that the shirt had been white . Teddie Crawford 's arms were crossed over himself as if to staunch the blood draining from his body . His dull brown stare was fixed on the ceiling . " Swiss cheese , " Taylor said . " Somebody turned him into fucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood the body holds , " Kate murmured . " One hell of a good-looking young guy , " Taylor offered . Wondering how he could tell , Kate looked more closely at the body . The head lay in a pool of blood , and the tousled hair , dark and thick , was saturated with it ; the face , bleached out , was measled with red droplets . Even so , the head and its features were finely made . Long eyelashes thickly fringed the staring dark eyes , the nose was patrician , the mouth , even in the slackness of death , was sensuous , the torso slender and well-formed . The bloodied hand nearest to Kate had long tapered fingers . In a scene of such carnage , she was amazed at Taylor 's perception . " Yes , " she agreed . " Very good-looking . " And gay . She sensed it with gut-deep certainty . She craned her body over the threshold , studying the dead man 's hand which was nearest to her ; it was turned palm down , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information from this room , and quickly . She said impatiently , " Not a damn thing we can do till the coroner and the technicians get here . We ca n't even go in . " Taylor pointed at the maelstrom of blood and bloody footprints . " How can anybody mess this up ? " " Let 's not make it worse , " Kate said flatly . As the D-3 on this case , she was in charge ; essential crime-scene decisions were hers . " We need Shapiro and Napoleon Carter here before anybody else goes in . " " See that ? " Taylor was pointing to the table . A piece of glass glittered under the fluorescent light ; a powdery residue coated its surface . " Coke , " he said . She shrugged . " Probably . " " A party that got out of hand , " Taylor said . " Way out of hand . " " Maybe , " Kate said , staring at the dead man 's fixed gaze , knowing she was being irrational as she hoped that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a party that had gotten " out of hand . " Chapter Two " My whole life 's in that place , " sobbed Francisco Caldera . " It 's gone , it 's nothing without Teddie ... " The rail-thin Latino was slumped sideways in the back seat of a black-and-white , feet dangling out of its open door , arms crossed in a clutching of his own body . Kate stood beside the squad car with Taylor . " When was the last time you saw him ? " she asked . With difficulty she kept her gaze focused on the grief-ravaged young face turned up to hers . After a single glance at Taylor , he had not taken his eyes off her . Even the knowledge that this man was a suspect , that killers often exhibited as much or more grief as anyone else , did not diminish an almost compelling need to soothe him , to stroke his thin , fine-textured dark hair . " Last night , " he said , brushing away tears . " We closed up at eleven . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " Big catering job tonight . We made marinades , sauces ... " He lifted a hand , dropped it into his lap in a gesture of futility . He wore a white cotton jacket over a lime green shirt ; his pants were gray and voluminous . Kate asked , " Who left first ? " Briefly he closed his eyes . Moisture glistened on his dark lashes . " He did . Gloria picked him up . " At Kate 's questioning look he added , " Gloria Gomez . His roommate . They have an apartment over on Crescent Heights . " A female roommate . Kate felt no shift in her certainty that Teddie Crawford was a gay man . And that Francisco Caldera was a gay man also . Possibly the female roommate was a lesbian . She said , " Where did they say they were going ? " " Malone 's . A bar in West Hollywood . " He added in bitter self-reproach , " He wanted me to go . But me , I had to get some sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be alive ... " Kate thought about Joe D'Amico at the crime lab and his constant gossip about the gay bars in West Hollywood and Silverlake ; she did n't recognize the name of this one . Could it be new ? Or perhaps not a gay bar ? She asked casually , " Does Malone 's have a particular clientele ? " " A mix . Gloria likes it . She was seeing some new guy she wanted Teddie to meet . " So Gloria Gomez apparently was heterosexual . And Malone 's Bar attracted an assortment of sexual orientation and ethnicity , judging by Gloria Gomez 's affection for it . " This Gloria , " Taylor said . " How 'd she get along with Teddie ? " " Like he was her brother . Everybody loved Teddie . " " Somebody did n't . Tell us what happened to him last night . " Warily eying Taylor , Caldera shook his head . " After he left here - I do n't have clue . " Kate observed Taylor with weary annoyance . His knee-jerk behavior toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertion of authority . Francisco Caldera might have been born and bred in middle-class American culture , but he was Latino , and that was all Taylor saw . Taylor said , " You actually see Gloria Gomez pick him up ? " " She honked from the alley . She drives a Honda Civic , I know the horn . " Hitching her pants to put a foot up on the floor of the squad car , Kate leaned over to be closer to Francisco Caldera , a hand not quite touching him . She said gently , " Tell us when you got here this morning and what you saw . " " I came in the place about seven o'clock - " His dark eyes awash and fixed on Kate , again he crossed his arms over his chest in an effort to control his shudders . " Which door ? " Taylor was busy writing . " Through the alley door like always . I saw Teddie ... lying there . I had to see if ... I ran to him , I slipped all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pointed a tremulous finger at his white Nikes . " It 's Teddie 's bl ... it 's Teddie 's bloom - " He dissolved into gulping sobs . Taylor asked , " Did you touch him ? " " I do n't remember , sir . " The voice sounded as if it were bubbling up through water . " Turn him over ? " Caldera shook his bowed head . " I was so scared , I got to the phone and then the police came . " " Why were you scared ? " Taylor 's voice was mild , but Caldera jerked his head up . " I never saw anybody dead before . It was Teddie . My friend , the best friend I ever - " Another paroxysm of tears . Taylor said , " You knew why this happened to him , that 's why you were scared , right ? " Jabbing tears off his cheeks with his fingers , Caldera stared at him . " Man , what are you talking about ? " Taylor , Kate conceded , was asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What can you tell us about his associates ? " " He knew everybody . All up and down the block . Everybody in the neighborhood where he lived . Everybody . " " His family , " Kate said , " what do you know about them ? " He slumped further down in the seat , a hand across his eyes . " Joe and Margaret will just ... " He shook his head . " Joe and Margaret , " Taylor said , writing in his notebook . " An aunt and uncle . They raised him . They live in a trailer park in Lancaster , but Teddie sees - saw them every chance he ... got . God ... he 's dead . " Again he burst into tears . Kate watched him with an emotion she recognized from witnessing bereavements and having gone through her own . People were either sheathed by shock and behaved calmly , Almost normally , as she had , or they were swallowed up by agony . Difficult as it might be to witness , agony at least meant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm sorry , " Kate said . " I know this is very hard for you . But we need to get information as quickly as we can to find out who did this . " She asked , " Did Teddie have enemies ? Anyone at all you can think of ? " " No . Not a soul . I tell you , everybody loved Teddie . " " Everybody 's got enemies , " Taylor stated . Caldera answered with quiet dignity : " Not Teddie . " " Who was his girlfriend ? " " Girlfriend ? " Caldera looked at him . " Teddie was gay . We 're both gay . " There it was . Kate marveled at Francisco Caldera , at the ease of it . She asked , " How did the two of you get along ? " Before Caldera could answer she rephrased the question more bluntly : " Were you lovers ? " " Never happened . Continues ...                   @ @
