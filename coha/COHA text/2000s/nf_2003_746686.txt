Abstract . A program of research related to school-based models for urban children 's mental health is described , with a particular focus on improving access to services , promoting children 's functioning , and providing for program sustainability . The first study in this series responded to the urgent need to engage more families in mental health services , and results showed dramatically greater involvement of parents in school-based services relative to clinic-based services . To enhance teacher collaboration , the second study involved training teacher key opinion leaders ( KOL ) on selected classroom practices for children with ADHD . Classroom teachers with support from the KOL teachers reported significantly higher use of these practices compared to teachers receiving no KOL support . The third study is part of a recent collaboration with the Illinois Office of Mental Health and the Chicago Public Schools , and employs a multitiered approach to service delivery , including the involvement of influential parents and teachers in the provision of mental health services . Future directions for mental health practice and research are described . <p> In this article three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of research focused on the development of school-based models for mental health service delivery to inner-city children and families . These models are specifically designed in response to three concerns : ( a ) limited access for children and families in need , ( b ) limited effectiveness on children 's real-world functioning , and ( c ) limited consideration of indigenous community resources as a means to foster sustainability . These foci have provided a framework to consider alternative mechanisms by which to engage families in services , to influence teachers towards accommodating children with ADHD , and to collaborate with policy officials at the Illinois Office of Mental Health and the Chicago Public Schools to develop a model with long-term sustainability . <p> The historic Surgeon General 's report on mental health ( U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , 2000 ) has , among many things , brought attention to the urgent call for a new understanding of children 's mental health needs and for a broadening perspective on ways to address these needs . As noted in the report , and first noted by Weisz and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , there is a critical gap between university-based clinical trials and community-based mental health practice . A highly influential task force report by the National Institute of Mental Health ( 1999 ) also concluded that practice-oriented research was a high priority for future funding . Since the publication of these reports , closing the gap between university-based clinical trials and community practice has become a national concern ( National Advisory Mental Health Council Workgroup on Child and Adolescent Mental Health Intervention Development and Deployment , 2001 ) . <p> For children and youth , this movement has focused primarily on improving the effectiveness of mental health services offered in community practice , largely through the dissemination of evidence-based practices ( Weisz &; Jensen , 1999 ) . However , perhaps even more urgent is the need to improve access to services . A recent analysis of three national surveys indicated that nearly 80% of youth ages 6-17 who were in need of mental health services did not receive services within the preceding 12 months , with rates approaching 90% for uninsured families ( Kataoka , Zhang , &; Wells , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient knowledge regarding intervention effectiveness to transport evidence-based strategies to community settings is questionable ( Hoagwood , Burns , Kiser , Ringeisen , &; Schoenwald , 2001 ) . In fact , in many ways , recent efforts to transport evidence-based practices for children and youth are revealing as much about gaps in knowledge as about gaps in services offered in clinical practice with children and youth ( Atkins , 2003b ) . <p> An additional shortcoming of children 's mental health services research is the lack of consideration for how programs will be sustained ( Annie E. Casey Foundation , 2002 ) . To improve services provided in community settings , research programs need to consider who will provide services , under what conditions , and how these services will be funded ( Hoagwood &; Johnson , 2003 ) . A focus on sustainability also requires consideration of ecological factors that either mediate or moderate positive functioning , and those factors that have been shown to impact on these mechanisms . Therefore , a major goal of mental health programs should be to ensure that effective services rely on indigenous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2002 ) . This focus addresses the problem common to many , if not most , urban schools and community-based social service agencies that find they do not have the resources to sustain services and programs once implemented ( Kondrat , Greene , &; Winbush , 2002 ) . <p> Schools are a logical site in which to base children 's mental health services . In regard to access to mental health services , schools offer the advantage of having relatively easy access to children , especially as compared to community mental health clinics where no-show rates are 50% or greater ( Kazdin , 1996 ) . However , there continues to be a reliance on individual counseling in most school-based programs ( Weist , 1997 ) , which is generally inappropriate for many childhood externalizing disorders ( Weisz &; Jensen , 1999 ) . Alternatively , school-based programs that focus on consultation with teachers and efforts to reduce barriers to parent involvement in their children 's schooling have been proposed more recently ( e.g. , McKay , 2000 ; McKay , Atkins , Lynn , &; Hawkins , 2003 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2003 ) . <p> A second reason for mental health services to focus on children 's schooling is the opportunity to assess the effect of services on multiple indicators of children 's functioning such as academic performance , peer relations , and classroom behavior . Hoagwood , Jensen , Petti , and Burns ( 1996 ) called attention to the overemphasis of children 's mental health services research on the reduction of symptoms to the exclusion of improved functioning . They noted that , although often correlated , the two are not the same . They proposed that a successful intervention should be assessed not with symptom checklists but with measures of daily life functioning such as homework completion , participation in classroom discussions , problem-solving disputes with peers , and so forth . This requires involvement from key stakeholders in children 's mental health , principally parents and teachers , to define appropriate program goals  --  a relatively rare occurrence in children 's mental health research ( Connor-Smith &; Weisz , 2003 ) . <p> We will describe results from three recent studies in Chicago focused on improving access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning for sustainability . These studies represent a program of research designed to improve mental health service delivery in inner-city schools and communities by attending to the unique needs and characteristics of teachers , children , and families ( Atkins et al. , 1998 ) . In the first study , we attempted to engage more families in mental health services by including parents from the community in the design and delivery of our program . For the second study , we trained peer-identified teacher leaders in evidence-based classroom practices for students with ADHD , and we examined the diffusion of information about these practices to other classroom teachers . Finally , a third , planned study with the Illinois Office of Mental Health and the Chicago Public Schools is described that involves a multitiered service delivery model that builds on the skills and strengths of influential parents and teachers . We present these studies as steps towards the development of comprehensive , effective , and sustainable mental health services for schools and families in underserved , low-income communities . Accessibility Through Community Collaboration : Positive Attitudes Toward Learning in School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children 's healthy development , we designed a service that integrated mental health goals into ongoing school routines and resources . The research was funded through a 3-year federal grant but the services were supported through Medicaid billing and , therefore , were applicable to community-based mental health programs serving low-income families . Positive Attitudes Toward Learning in School ( PALS ) was designed to ( a ) minimize barriers and maximize service accessibility ; ( b ) improve children 's academic , behavioral , and social functioning ; and ( c ) develop the capacity of classrooms , schools , and families to sustain positive change . A fuller description of this study can be found in Atkins , Adil , Jackson , McKay , and Bell ( 2001 ) and Atkins et al . ( 2003b ) . For the purposes of this article , a brief review of the methods and results will be presented . Research Design <p> PALS participants were drawn from three low-income , inner-city schools on the Near Westside of Chicago , an economically disadvantaged community . Kindergarten through sixth grade students identified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by classroom to receive services through our school-based PALS program or at a university-based mental health clinic . Families assigned to clinic-based services received an extensive telephone-based engagement interview that had been shown to be successful with inner-city families ( McKay , Nudelman , &; McCadam , 1996 ) . Across the 3 years of the study , a total of 75 children were enrolled in PALS ( 41% female , 97% African American ) and 36 children were enrolled into clinic-based services ( 55% female , 97% African American ) . <p> PALS was developed specifically in response to the urgent need to engage more families in effective services and , therefore , was based on an engagement framework ( McKay , 2000 ) . The goal was to approach families in ways that encouraged the development of an ongoing working relationship , and to identify treatment goals consistent with family priorities . We enlisted parents in the community as partners in the design and delivery of services to provide a perspective that reflected the daily experiences of families and to offer clinicians a window into the cultural world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCadam , &; Gonzales , 1996 ; McKay , Stoewe , McCadam , &; Gonzales , 1998 ) . Community consultants also provided parents with a community-based contact to enhance communication between families and mental health service providers . <p> Staff clinicians and community consultants worked collaboratively on school-based teams . The community consultants played an increasingly larger role over time . Early in the project , they educated staff about the resources and needs of the community , and accompanied staff on school and home visits . They participated in the development of clinical resources , and assisted with the initial and ongoing engagement of identified families in services , principally via home visits , phone calls , flyers , and informal contacts on the streets . However , given the extensive distrust of social services within these communities due to a history of discrimination and neglectful services ( Pottick , Lerman , &; Micchelli , 1992 ) , their role gradually expanded to capitalize on their unique strengths and expertise . By project 's end , they were participating in curriculum planning for parent groups , and ultimately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Once families had enrolled their child in PALS , we proceeded with a flexible service delivery model that included family services and classroom services . The family services emphasized support for children 's academic and behavioral progress at school , as well as social support and skill development for parents , and offered multiple opportunities for parent involvement in their child 's schooling ( Heller &; Fantuzzo , 1993 ) . These included biweekly parent groups ( which were facilitated by our community consultants and referred to as " parent parties " ) , home visits , school-sponsored meetings , informal meetings at school or within the community , contacts with community consultants , and phone conversations . Classroom services incorporated multiple levels of intervention and evidence-based practices . They included opportunities for contingency-based , classwide , behavior management strategies such as the Good Behavior Game ( Barrish , Saunders , &; Wolf , 1969 ) , academically oriented interventions such as peer tutoring ( DuPaul &; Hennington , 1993 ; Heller &; Fantuzzo , 1993 ) , individualized programs such as school-home notes ( Kelley , 1990 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and teacher support . <p> Our examination of the first 9 months of data from PALS suggests that the strong emphasis on engagement and our reliance on the community consultants were appropriate strategies for enrolling families in services ( Atkins , Adil , &; Jackson , 2001 ) . At recruitment , 60 of 64 families ( 93.8% ) assigned to the 12 PALS classrooms agreed to enroll in the program , whereas only 24 of 35 families ( 68.6% ) assigned to the 8 control classrooms agreed to enroll in clinic-based services ( csubdf=1 , N=99 = 11.16 , p &lt; .001 ) . At 3 months following enrollment , all PALS families remained in services , whereas no clinic families were receiving any mental health services for their children . In fact , only 2 of the 24 clinic families received any services at all during this time , and those 2 children received only one session of medication management with no follow-up . By 9 months following enrollment , 86% of the 64 PALS families still remained involved in services . The only families who withdrew from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools . <p> Several unforeseen events during the second year of the project disrupted our clinical service and research design and limited the involvement of additional families . Specifically , a university-wide shutdown of all human subject research during an institutional review board investigation led to the curtailment of recruitment for an entire year . By the time research was reinitiated , a shortage of funds resulted in a need to withdraw from one of the three schools . Nevertheless , approximately two-thirds of PALS families agreed to re-enroll in PALS services for our third and final project year , compared to approximately one-quarter of control families who re-enrolled in clinic-based services . Unfortunately , these results also resulted in a very low sample size in the third and last year of the project and a control group too small to compare child outcomes . <p> PALS results suggest that our flexible model coupled with the intensive parent outreach efforts may have increased access to services for families historically underserved by the mental health system . Our next research objective was to explore how indigenous resources in urban schools could provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with mental health needs , such as students with Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) . Sustainability Through Indigenous Resources : Teacher Key Opinion Leaders ( KOL ) <p> The Teacher Key Opinion Leader ( KOL ) project applies social diffusion theory ( Rogers , 1983 ) to enhance implementation of school-based mental health services for students with ADHD in low-income urban schools . Specifically , we were interested to see if highly regarded teachers would be more influential with their peers than would community mental health providers . We received funding for a 3-year study of this model in 10 inner city Chicago Public Schools . The study is in its final year and , therefore , for this article , we will describe the rationale of the project and present a brief review of the study , including preliminary data on the program 's effectiveness at impacting teachers ' willingness to use evidence-based accommodations for children with ADHD . Social Diffusion Theory <p> Social diffusion theory posits that innovations become disseminated throughout a social network through the persuasion of key opinion leaders ( KOL ) within that network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed that influential peers who are early adopters of an innovation effect change within their social networks which , in turn , impacts other social networks in ways that are highly specific to settings and systems . Rogers ( 1983 ) noted that professional change agents are individuals who have knowledge to help a client but may have difficulty communicating that knowledge directly . If the change agent has access to a key opinion leader , Rogers proposed , the change agent could more effectively transfer information or knowledge to the network members through the persuasive influence of opinion leaders . Thus , by working in conjunction , opinion leaders and change agents can introduce new innovations and increase the adoption of those innovations in a social system . This is highly relevant to mental health consultation to schools and to the efforts of mental health providers to affect teachers ' classroom practices for students with ADHD . Therefore , the goal for this study was to test whether diffusion theory may be a useful and potentially important model to improve collaboration between mental health providers and teachers . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classroom teachers in predominantly low-income African American urban communities . The innovations we targeted for adoption by teachers were selected evidence-based educational practices for children with ADHD . The mechanism by which we intended to influence classroom teachers to adopt these practices was the endorsement of key opinion leader ( KOL ) teachers in their buildings . <p> Sustainability was a key consideration in the design of the KOL project and it was addressed in two ways . First , the " active ingredient " that distinguished treatment from comparison schools was the inclusion of KOL teachers as disseminators of selected classroom practices among their fellow teachers . By definition , KOL teachers were highly regarded members of their school 's teaching faculty and as such represented key indigenous resources in their schools . <p> Second , sustainability issues were addressed by the project 's focus on developing the necessary infrastructure for mental health agencies and schools to partner in providing services to children with ADHD . The complexity of this task can not be overstated . In spite of the fact that the schools and the agencies were eager to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedures between institutions operating from different models of service delivery . For example , schools had to develop a referral process that would work best for their staff and families , at times adding more work to an already very full school day . Community mental health agencies needed to free staff to learn billing procedures for school-based work and to spend time in the school to learn the school 's norms and practices . Nonetheless , most schools and agencies were able to vault the many obstacles they faced in establishing their collaborations and now have procedures in place for the next school year . Research Design <p> Participants in this ongoing project included first through fourth grade children with ADHD and their teachers in 10 Chicago public schools serving predominantly low-income African American communities . Participating schools were randomly selected from a set of 64 schools of similar size , SES , ethnic composition , and achievement level . Six schools were assigned to the KOL condition and 4 schools to a control condition consisting of mental health consultation with no KOL support . Children with ADHD in Grades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clinician diagnosis . <p> In the six experimental condition schools , KOL teachers were identified through nomination procedures with the targeted classroom teachers . Classroom teachers were asked to name the other teachers at their school to whom they go for advice on a variety of classroom issues . Teachers who received the highest number of nominations were identified as the KOL teachers in their respective buildings . Two or 3 teachers were identified at each school to reach an exposure rate of 70% of teachers in each school ( i.e. , 70% or more teachers identified one of the KOL teachers as someone to whom they go for advice ) . All 13 identified KOL teachers agreed to serve as teacher consultants for the project at their schools . Three groups of classroom teachers were followed : those who reported receiving support from a KOL teacher ( KOL-support ) , those who taught in KOL schools but did not report receiving KOL support ( KOL-no support ) , and teachers in comparison schools ( controls ) . <p> KOL teachers and mental health staff from local community agencies received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schools ADHD policy manual ( http : **75;2798;TOOLONG ) via a web-based course . The practices included individual behavior plans using positive reinforcement and response cost procedures , the Good Behavior Game ( Barrish et al. , 1969 ) , home-school notes ( Kelley , 1990 ) , and peer tutoring ( DuPaul &; Hennington , 1993 ; Heller &; Fantuzzo , 1993 ) . In the four comparison schools , mental health staff underwent the same training as the KOL teachers and mental health providers in the experimental condition schools , and provided support to classroom teachers who had one or more student with ADHD in their classroom . <p> A primary goal of the project was to determine whether teachers in KOL schools used more recommended strategies compared to teachers in comparison schools as would be suggested by the diffusion of innovation literature ( Rogers , 1983 ) . Teachers reported on their use of strategies , the effectiveness of each strategy used , and the support they received during the prior month from mental health providers ( both conditions ) and KOL teachers ( KOL condition only ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of Year 3 are encouraging ( Graczyk et al. , 2003 ) . KOL-supported teachers reported using significantly more of the 11 recommended strategies compared to the other two groups of teachers ( Wilks 's Lambda F ( 22,126 ) = 2.15 , p &lt; .01 ) and significant between-group differences were found on 7 of the strategies ( KOL support &gt; control , p &lt; .05 ) . In contrast , support from mental health providers was not significantly associated with either overall use of strategies or with the use of any specific strategy in either condition . Ongoing use of these practices is being studied across the current school year to determine the extent of KOL influence over time and the differential effect on different types of classroom practices on student outcomes . Service Integration and Sustainability : System of Care  --  Chicago ( SOC-C ) <p> In collaboration with the Illinois Office of Mental Health ( OMH ) , the Chicago Public Schools ( CPS ) , and the Illinois State Board of Education ( ISBE ) , we have recently begun to develop a model for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and families . Considering the limited knowledge regarding sustainability of mental health programs for urban children , this collaboration provided a unique opportunity to consider the public policy implications of school-based mental health services . <p> ISBE had several years of experience with Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports ( PBIS ; Sugai &; Homer , 2002 ) , a popular program for improving school discipline and enhancing learning . Although the program was adopted throughout the state , it previously had been largely unsuccessful in the Chicago schools . In fact , ISBE staff reported that in the prior 3 years , 18 of 19 CPS schools that expressed interest in implementing PBIS withdrew from training within the first year . The consensus was that this was due to the schools ' inability to accommodate the apparent high resource needs of the program . <p> Therefore , to provide schools with additional implementation support , CPS reassigned existing resources , through a school-based pre-intervention referral program implemented district-wide , to help teachers develop behavioral or academic interventions for high-risk students ( Nerad , 1989 ) . In addition , given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each school was additionally linked with a neighboring community mental health agency . However , instead of being primarily a referral source for the schools , social service agency resources were allocated toward implementing and sustaining PBIS . The rationale was that well-organized and successful schools have considerable mental health benefits for all students , and additional social services could then be targeted to children and families with the greatest needs ( Atkins et al. , 2003a ; Leaf , Schultz , Kiser , &; Pruitt , 2003 ) . To date , this is one of the largest implementations of PBIS in urban schools in the country , and the first to propose extensive collaboration with community-based social service agencies . <p> As described in Sugai and Horner ( 2002 ) and Crone and Horner ( 2003 ) , PBIS uses a multitiered model to reduce disruptive school behavior . The first tier is a universal intervention that is available to all students , teachers , and families regardless of student risk status . Each school forms a team composed of administrators and teachers and uses disciplinary record data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Based on their review of these records , the team decides on specific activities and interventions appropriate for their school . As the title of the program implies , the emphasis is on providing positive alternatives to disruptive behavior ( Crone &; Horner , 2003 ) . In SOC-C , a representative of the assigned community social service agency participates on this team . Examples of universal activities include organization of supervised activities before or after school , organizing school-wide events to support learning , and parent involvement activities . <p> The second tier is a targeted intervention team that identifies students who need support beyond the school-wide universal strategies , and have elevated risk for social-emotional difficulties ( e.g. , disruptive behavior , anxiety and depression ) . As with the universal tier , each school forms a team with similar composition to the universal team , including membership by a representative of the participating social service agency , to decide upon needs and programs for that school . Examples of activities at this level are consultation with teachers for classroom behavior management strategies , student peer social support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Crone &; Horner , 2003 ) . <p> The third tier is an intensive intervention approach for those students who have not responded sufficiently to targeted interventions . Intensive services are based on the wrap-around process , which is a strength-based approach for identifying and allocating indigenous resources in school and community settings to meet the individual needs of children and their families ( Burchard , Bruns , &; Burchard , 2002 ) . An individualized wrap-around team is formed for each referred child , composed of that child 's parent and teacher , a member of the school mental health team , and , in SOC-C , a representative of the community mental health agency . These school-based wraparound teams may blend supportive services for families and students ( e.g. , respite care ) with traditional behavioral , clinical , and academic interventions at school or home ( Eber , Sugai , Smith , &; Scott , 2002 ) . In addition , community-based mental health providers may provide access to a variety of community-based services , including case management , in-home supports , medical interventions , and home-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy implications for the advancement of school-based mental health . First , SOC-C provides a structure to enable an array of child-serving agencies to coordinate the delivery of multiple services to inner-city children and families . For example , through this collaboration , efforts have been initiated to provide waivers for Medicaid funding that will allow agencies and schools to bill Medicaid for universal prevention programming based on the likely benefit to special need children and families ( Hoagwood &; Koretz , 1996 ) . Second , SOC-C provides a formal interface between school-based and community-based mental health providers to promote the positive academic and behavioral development of inner-city children . This shared vision for school-based and community-based providers can avoid fragmentation of services and marginalization of mental health goals within schools ( Adelman &; Taylor , 2003 ) . The participation of community-based social service staff at all three tiers of PBIS is intended to encourage a systemic awareness of resources and needs of the school , and to avoid overidentification of child or family characteristics as responsible for child difficulties . Third , SOC-C uses a data-driven approach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intensive intervention levels . This approach is consistent with the increasing calls for the adoption of evidence-based practices to guide service provision and agency reimbursement ( Hoagwood et al. , 2001 ) . <p> Toward the goal of sustainability , SOC-C focuses on the identification and support of indigenous school and community resources to sustain programs and services . The use of school teams to consider how to realign school resources to support positive behavior at all three levels ( i.e. , universal , targeted , intensive ) avoids the problem of overloading schools with services and programs that they are unable to maintain and support . In addition , the linkage between schools and community social service agencies encourages a consideration of the best use of social service resources on behalf of children 's mental health . The ultimate goal is to develop a new standard of care for the delivery of effective services for children and families living in inner-city communities . Summary and Conclusions <p> This article describes three studies of school-based mental health services for urban children . The studies are part of an ongoing program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enhancing children 's functioning , and providing for long-term sustainability through reliance on indigenous community resources . As noted throughout , we view these studies as part of a programmatic effort to develop a service delivery model sensitive to the unique needs and competencies of inner-city communities . Key components of our emerging model are indicated in Table 1 . <p> Although numerous avenues of inquiry remain unexplored , it seems clear from this work that in the communities we serve , mental health services are enhanced by collaboration with influential community members . From PALS , our data suggest that without an extensive outreach effort in which community consultants played a large role , many families would never have entered services and others would have been lost to services over time . This is not to discount the considerable effort of the PALS clinical staff . However , it was clear that the community consultants enhanced the program 's credibility in a community that has historically been distrustful of university-based researchers and mental health providers . The dismal show rates for our clinic-based control group conforms to a larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vast majority of families in these communities , and the powerful effect of the focus on engaging families in PALS services . <p> The KOL study has been an exciting and energizing demonstration of the activation of experienced teachers on behalf of their colleagues . They are , perhaps , an ideal example of an indigenous resource with unique and powerful influences on their colleagues , although we have much to learn regarding the extent of their influence and the ideal use of their time and resources . Among the many questions that remain unresolved are the specific types of mental health programs that are most appropriate for dissemination in these schools , and the extent to which other forms of educational innovations can be accommodated by the KOL method . <p> Although the SOC-C program is in a preliminary phase of development and implementation , it appears to be a promising vehicle for effective school and mental health collaboration for inner-city children . The interagency framework links educators , community-based mental health providers , and child welfare systems in collaborative efforts to promote positive development in inner-city children and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school settings where children often have multiple needs that require coordinated efforts between multiple agencies ( Atkins , Frazier , Adil , &; Talbott , 2003a ) . Moreover , SOC-C provides a multitiered model for designing and delivering mental health interventions to meet the range of needs of urban children . This is an often overlooked element of effective mental health programs and especially difficult for community mental health agencies to manage independently , given the overwhelming need in the inner city and the considerable lack of resources to meet this need ( Kondrat et al. , 2002 ) . <p> Future research needs to address the large discrepancy between a public sector mental health system that is unable to address the needs of the vast majority of children and families and a university-dominated research model that has neglected the major systemic issues that undermine the use of effective services . In this regard , the movement to advance evidence-based practice is an important start but requires an additional focus and direction . Specifically , we propose that issues of access and sustainability emerge into the forefront of a research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defined in part by the degree to which these issues are addressed . This may require a new set of research standards and techniques that highlight barriers to initial and long-term utilization and that include consumer perspectives ( Hohmann &; Shear , 2002 ) . <p> This is not to downplay the substantial challenges to such work . How best to overcome systemic barriers to effective practice is neither obvious nor certain , although we are encouraged that such a focus can lead to new insights . For example , in our own work , our commitment to engage all families in services , and to sustain this engagement through active outreach , substantially changed the nature and focus of our services to accommodate the input and perspectives of our families and community consultants . Similarly , in regard to consultation with teachers , our goal was to provide services that addressed the needs of their students , which in some cases required sustained dialogue to accommodate different perspectives of parents , teachers , and mental health providers . This ultimately led to our interest in studying a teacher key opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will likely lead to an everwidening appreciation for other indigenous supports in urban schools . <p> Finally , it is important to highlight that both PALS and KOL demonstrated that , under the right set of conditions , parents and teachers in impoverished , urban communities are eager to become involved in efforts to promote the mental health of their children and students . Our experiences on PALS and KOL also led us to appreciate the stresses and frustrations of teachers at these inner-city schools . Ultimately , we will continue to learn through iteration and trial and error . In many ways , we realize that we are confronting the residual and overwhelming influence of poverty . Indeed , the name for PALS , Positive Attitudes for Learning in School , evolved from discussions with parents , teachers , and children that highlighted the need to combat the negativism that often permeates inner-city schools and communities . Nevertheless , it is not difficult to see that mental health resources can make a real difference when applied to the enhancement of children 's schooling .
