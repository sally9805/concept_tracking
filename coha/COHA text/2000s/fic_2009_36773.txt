Chase 's first day on the job they took the sobbing chauffeur out back , gutted him , then handed Chase the cap and the little white gloves . <br> They threw the guy in the open trunk of a Chrysler 300 Super Stretch , where he clutched at his belly and bled out between his fingers . There was a full bar in back of the limo and the others sneaked some booze and talked about horse track results . <br> In his gradually lessening terror the chauffeur quietly spoke in a trembling but resonant voice of grace . Prayers , passages from the Bible , names of his family . Bobby . Emily . Maria . Maria . His eyes met Chase 's only once . A charge danced through the air . The dying man 's mouth eased open into a strangely empty grin . Maria . Chase 's fists were stones at his sides . The trunk was lined with plastic bags duct taped into place , and when the chauffeur vented , the others smelled it , finished their drinks , then slammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a test , snuffing the guy right in front of him like that , twenty minutes after walking in the door . But nobody seemed to give a shit what he thought . <br> He was told that the chauffeur had been pinched a couple months ago for running whores out the back of the limo during his off-hours . He 'd drive around the west side of Manhattan with a couple drunk businessmen and three or four girls lying across the leather seats , giving head . He ran a light on 91st in front of a black-and-white , and that was the end of that setup . The chauffeur had met with the DA on the sly to talk about the Langan family and cut a deal . <br> Assuming this was an object lesson meant for him , Chase did his best to appear both impressed and intimidated . Someone handed him the keys . <br> He tossed them back . He explained how this was n't his area of expertise . He 'd been hired to be he was goddamn told . They said there was room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to get especially loud and tried to take a poke at Chase . Moe Irvine showed up and told the others to take off , go find a landfill in Newark or some fucking place . <br> That afternoon Moe brought in a stoop-shouldered Jewish tailor from North Bergen , who got Chase up on a tiny stool , made him put on an oversized suit , then stuck pins in and drew chalk marks all over the black cloth . The tailor noticed the bandages beneath Chase 's T-shirt but said nothing about them . <br> " Single-breasted or double ? " the tailor asked . <br> Moe Irvine answered . " Single . " <br> " High rise or low ? " <br> " Low . " <br> " Full sleeve or narrow ? " <br> " Narrow , of course . " <br> " Four days . " <br> " You have two . " <br> " Three days . " <br> " You heard what I told you , Isaac . " <br> The tailor said nothing more and slipped from the room , giving Chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who would 've been called a consigliere if the family had been Italian instead of blue bloods going back to the Minutemen , told him the suit would look nice , now he needed some ties . <br> It took Moe a couple minutes to find a few he was satisfied with . He held them up to Chase 's collar , let them drape this way and that , then pinched them down in place like there was a tie tack . Finally , Moe nodded to himself and pulled four aside , then plucked a diamond stickpin from his pocket . <br> " You understand your duties here ? " Moe asked . <br> Chase looked at him for a moment until he realized Moe was serious and actually wanted a response . <br> " I drop people off and I pick them up again ? " <br> " Their well-being is your responsibility . You protect them . " <br> " I 'm not a bodyguard . " <br> " You are now . " <br> " That 's not what I do . You 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a driver . " <br> " While you drive , you are the bodyguard . That 's the job . If you 're not up for it , tell me now . " <br> Having just watched a guy get aced , Chase figured the time to say no had already wafted past . <br> " All right , " Chase said . <br> " Good . You have a piece ? " <br> " No . " <br> " You do n't carry a gun ? " <br> " I told you , I 'm a driver , " Chase said , sounding stupid even to himself . It was impossible to make some people understand that the best wheelmen never carried hardware . <br> Reaching into his briefcase , Moe appraised Chase once more , searching deeper this time , his face heavy with thought . Chase did the same thing , studying Moe and seeing a man who was used to running a dangerous but lucrative machine that was suddenly breaking down all around him through no fault of his own . <br> A carefully hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mouth and eyes . He was around sixty , well kept and solid , with silver-white hair receding from a prominent widow 's peak . He had the kind of maple-syrup tan that you had to spend months working on , slathered in baby oil in the backyard holding a metal reflector up around your neck . A broad spatter of caramel-colored freckles flecked his nose and cheeks . They looked this close to going cancerous . His three-piece suit was formfitting with just a little heft in the shoulders to square him off . <br> Moe pulled a Browning 9mm and a shoulder holster from his briefcase and handed them to Chase . <br> There was something almost precocious in how unsubtle these people were . Chase stared at him for an extra second and accepted the Browning . Chase hated guns but now was n't the time to argue . <br> They let him bunk in the servants ' quarters , a late-nineteenth-century , three-story brick building about a hundred yards away from the main house . It had been converted into a kind of modified duplex . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the muscle , the hitters , the butler , and the landscapers stayed on one side , and the three Polish maids , the lady gardener , and the cook resided on the other . It was like a college dorm . The estate covered sixty acres , about a mile from the Hudson . Chase thought he could smell the water but it was probably his imagination . <br> He carried his gym bag to a small bedroom and checked the upstairs windows of the main house across the way . The big boss , Lenny Langan , was dying up there , wasting away from prostate cancer . An ' 07 black Buick Lucerne with medical plates was parked at the side entrance , on a slight angle , like the doc had come screaming up the driveway in a panic to help save Lenny . The guy going through the motions despite the foregone conclusion . <br> Before Chase could unpack and settle himself , a torpedo came marching in with the front of his shirt covered with dry smears of blood . The guy stopped just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " Hey , welcome to the action , " then proceeded down the corridor to another room . <br> Jesus Christ , these syndicate people , Chase thought , they 're all fucked . <br> He shut his door and phoned the Deuce , asked him , " What the hell kind of mob outfit is this ? " <br> Deucie sounded like he was talking around his cigar stub . " Thirty years ago , one of the best . Now , they 're disorganized and on the run . Look , I told you it was a bad setup , with all the infighting and mob-war bullshit . But you wanted me to make the call , set up the meeting . " <br> " You told me they needed a driver . Instead I 'm a chauffeur . And a gun-toting chauffeur at that . " <br> " Jackie Langan said he wanted a driver . Is it my fault the mook does n't know the difference between a getaway man and some smoke he wants to call Jeeves ? Do you have to wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a sigh or it would never end . " Yeah . They gave me white gloves too . " <br> " Jesus , they like to play the role to the hilt , do n't they ? It 's one of the reasons they 're off the media 's radar , because nobody takes them seriously anymore . All those news anchors storming into the fish markets and the butcher shops with their camera guys , chasing the old mob bosses down the street ? They never hassled Lenny and his chauffeurs with the gloves . The feds never wanted to infiltrate them because it was no fun . They could n't grow mustaches and wear Hawaiian shirts and sunglasses at night , use wiseguy accents . The feebs held classes , teaching their agents to say , ' fegeddaboutit ' and ' pasta fasool . ' But so who gives a shit ? You sit back and drive those rich pricks into the city to do their shopping . Pretty soon Lenny will cough up the ghost and the rest of them will move to Chi or Palm Springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for long . " <br> " They want me to play bodyguard too , Deuce . " <br> " It 's mostly for show . They ca n't get any of the regular crew to get behind the wheel  --  those wannabe wiseguys all figure the job is beneath them . No action to it . Sitting on your ass and taking orders is no way to get promoted and get your button . Besides , the family is afraid that some of those muscleheads waiting around behind the wheel might start taking some incentive on how to move up the ranks . So they farm the job out . " <br> " But I 'm a total stranger . " <br> " Gives you less reason to pop them than one of their own . " <br> Chase had been going full clip for more than a month now , with almost no rest . It was the way he wanted it . He did n't want to think about being alone in the world now that Lila was gone . But hearing the chauffeur 's last words , spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make Chase think again . <br> " They aced the previous chauffeur right in front of me . Those gloves I mentioned ? They were still warm from his hands . Not a clean kill either  --  they opened him up and left him in the trunk crying for his kids . " <br> " Fuck sake , for what ? Not tipping the hat ? Driving over too many potholes ? You better not make any sharp left turns . " Deucie wheezed out a laugh that died abruptly , the way it should 've . The Deuce had sharp instincts , and he could hear the wheels spinning inside of Chase , the shifting from first into second . " Wait a second here , you 're not looking to boost the house , are you ? You nuts ? I did n't send you over there to score the joint . " <br> " How could you not ? " Chase asked . " I 'm a thief . " <br> " You been straight for the last ten years . Now I do n't know what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , got rid of the cigar butt , spoke clearly into the phone . " Listen , kid , did n't you hear your own fucking story ? These people are n't clean . They do things dirty and ugly . So why the hell are you even there ? You do n't have to be there . " <br> " I 've got to do something with myself . " <br> " Go back to teaching auto shop . " <br> " I think those days are all behind me now . " <br> " Only if you want them to be . You should cut out  --  they probably got nineteen hitters on the payroll . " <br> " Yeah , a couple live right down the hall . One just welcomed me to the family . I think he might be back soon with bundt cake . " <br> " At least they wo n't have far to walk to ice you . That outfit 's got grief up to the neck . Lenny was slick , but Jackie 's an apple that fell too far from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being primed to take over , so that just makes for more internal trouble . Already they ca n't hold off the Russians and the Chinese and the feebs . RICO cases are being made . Capos flipping , all kinds of backstabbing , taking potshots at one another in restaurants . You do n't need that shit . " <br> In the background , the Deuce 's chop shop sounded way too busy for this time of the afternoon . Deucie was getting a little sloppy too , having his crew make runs in broad daylight . " Get out of there , " he said to Chase . " Now . Just go . Do n't score them . It does n't matter if you take ten bucks or a hundred g 's , it makes them look bad . You know these syndicates . They never stop looking for the people who rob them , hit them , betray them  --  it 's their number one rule . It 's what they live for . They 'll come after you forever . You do n't need that grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beating like you did , bullet wounds , loss of blood , a couple cracks to the head , you got ta give yourself time to recover . You 're not thinking straight . Depression , it 's genetic , you got the gene . I know you 're hurting about Lila , and what happened with Jonah , I know you 're out there on the edge right now , and part of you wants to fall over . A lot of bodies are turning up in the Hudson , or not at all . Do n't  --  " <br> " Yeah , they 've got a landfill someplace , " Chase said , and hung up . <br> There were fourteen cars and trucks in the estate garages , everything from a three-year-old Mercedes to an F430 Spider and a Ford pickup . <br> They were all in bad shape  --  scratched , dinged , rusted , sludge wearing out the engines . They 'd been driven hard by amateurs who did n't believe in regular care . Chase was a little worried about just how well the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> Since nobody had given him anything to do yet , Chase went to work on the vehicles . <br> He pulled them out into the huge egg-shaped driveway in front of the main house and eavesdropped on the Langan crew as they milled about . There were supposed to be guards patrolling the grounds but everybody just stood around smoking and bullshitting . <br> He learned that in the six months since Lenny Langan had more or less cashed out of the game , lying in bed with tubes in his nose and down his throat and in his crank while everybody was on death watch , his son Jackie had really spiffed up the estate . The guy had added a nine-hole golf course out back and vamped the main house by stripping all the cherry paneling and painting the place a pale chamois . It was all wasted flash since they 'd probably be leaving soon . <br> Chase picked up on the particulars . The Langans were being run out of Jersey by the Korean , Chinese , and Russian mobs , among others , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up again as a much smaller outfit . Most of the crew knew they were getting the ax and had started up little side businesses , like the chauffeur had done . <br> The Mercedes had a fine stereo system , and Chase climbed in and turned on the radio , found an oldies station , and felt the tuned engine hum through his bones . He shut his eyes . The music took him back to when he was a kid and his parents danced around the living room together , his mother staring over his father 's shoulder and making funny faces at Chase . It brought him back to the nights when he 'd drive down the ocean parkways with Lila , heading out to the point , where they 'd find some stretch of beach and she 'd say , " Sweetness , you get more than flirty with me down in the dunes and you 're gon na scratch us both raw . " He 'd say he did n't care and she 'd go , " Glad to hear it , love , ' cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
