When you 're faced with whining or tantrums , the best reaction may be no reaction // I 'M ON AN AIRPLANE , and my 3-year-old daughter is beating her baby doll 's head against the back of the seats in front of us . The seats are empty , and despite my wondering whether the person across the aisle thinks I 'm raising a pathologically aggressive child , and knowing that the banging really does bug me , I 'm ignoring it . This , I promise you , does n't come easily . I want to tell Anna to put the doll down . I want to explain that it is n't nice to bang Baby . I want to grab it and stuff it into my bag . But the reality is , she 's not banging the doll all that hard , and it 's not making much noise , hurting the doll or the seat , or , appearances aside , indicative of any deep-seated psychosis . Anna 's just bored , and I 'm mostly worried about what other people might think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment on the doll-pummeling and instead offer her stickers . She takes them , and the doll , now at her feet , is spared . So are Anna and I , who have resolved the incident without confrontation . Moderating my reaction and gently redirecting my daughter 's behavior ( or , in some cases , out and out ignoring it ) is a parenting skill I 've only recently-and sporadically-put into practice . It runs counter to my quick-response , take-action , talk-it-out personality . And the airplane episode was one of the easier ones for me to cope with . Sidelong glances from strangers and battered plastic babies I can ignore . But what about whining , or tantrums , or eleventh-hour bedtime begging ? I know that my usual reactions-exasperation , exhortation , submission-will never put an end to these annoyances , and may in fact encourage them . Could I apply nonreaction to these as well ? Photograph Knowing what makes him tick can help you keep calm // Doing nothing is hard work For most parents , " Just do n't react " is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not difficult to understand why . For starters , many things our kids do are really irritating , so we rise to the bait and react . Loudly . Or their whined demands go on long enough that we just give in , even though we know we should n't . But regardless of whether the problem is surrendering to a tyrannical toddler 's order that you throw out her sandwich and make her a new one cut in squares , or being pushed noisily to the end of your rope by a preschooler crying because she 's not allowed to wear your pearl necklace to the playground , ignoring obnoxious behavior does n't really mean you do nothing . What it means is that you ignote your exasperated or enraged gut response and offer one that is reasoned and calm instead . Brooke Hummer Mower of Chicago , the mother of a 5- and a 7-year old , admits a lack of parental backbone when it comes to her boys ' stalling tactics . " I know I should ignore them when they ask to change their clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for school , " she says . " They start saying , These pants are too tight , and I want this hat-no , I want the other one . ' I know I should put my foot down . Instead , I indulge them . " Which brings up the other factor that can make these situations difficult : No parent wants to ignore a child 's legitimate requests or feelings . Maybe his pants are too tight . Effectively ignoring your child as a parenting strategy means sorting out the difference between his deliberate ( and often obnoxious ) attention-getting behaviors and his very real needs . It means figuring out what 's going to set a precedent you 'll have to deal with in the future and what 's a passing developmental fad . And it means understanding what motivates your child 's behavior-and your own . This is what I managed to do successfully on the plane . I ignored the doll-bonking but succeeded in stopping it through a reasoned reaction : diversion via stickers . So how can you disregard the merely annoying while correcting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack thereof , has an effect only because your child cares about and notices so completely what you do and think-despite apparent evidence to the contrary . This is why seeming to do nothing , in response to their best efforts to get you to do otherwise , can be so effective . " It 's a powerful tool , " says Mary Engleman-Kemmer of Wichita , Kansas , the mom of three , ages 12 , 9 , and 5 . " Mine know they have n't pleased me if I ignore them . If I 'm not reacting to them , it 's like they 're in a time-out . " Your child 's attention to what you think and feel is also the reason that allowing yourself to get caught up in a cycle of kneejerk scolding can be detrimental . Nobody wants her child to say " poop " and " pee " over and over . But just because a toddler or preschooler is doing this during the course of a few days does n't mean he 's on the road to swearing like a sailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it may last longer than a few days ) . " If your child does something that is not dangerous but obnoxious , and you respond in an overly negative way , you run the risk of starting a vicious cycle that ultimately has a life of its own , " explains psychologist Ernest Fruge , Ph.D. , coauthor of Why Children Misbehave and What to Do About It . " In other words , a minor incident could turn into a major problem . And the lesson your child learns is that he can get your attention immediately through irritating behavior . " Ironically , attention may not have been his original goal . He may just have been experimenting with language , figuring out what he is and is n't allowed to say , a common goal of potty talk at this age . So how should you react ? Buy some time Say you 've just finished folding the laundry when your 2-yearold tips it over , climbs into the empty basket , then jumps out onto the clothes . You 're understandably annoyed . But instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . During this brief pause , think about your child 's motivation . It 's possible that she does n't understand what she 's done and is just having fun . Or perhaps she understands exactly what she 's done and is trying to get your goat . Either way , stopping for a second or two helps you figure out the lesson you want to get across and how-or if-you 'll respond . And , says Fruge , " when you pause for a moment to figure out how you want to react , you show your child a calm way to handle provocation , and you demonstrate how to control and manage irritation with others . " Ignore behavior ; respond to emotion Certain things kids do are almost guaranteed to rile even the most sweet-tempered parent . The top culprit ? Whining , by a long shot . It 's probably the behavior most deserving of disregard . But that does n't mean it 's a call to inaction . " It never hurts to acknowledge your child 's feelings , " says Phyllis Sonnenschein , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cambridge , Massachusetts . " But do so with a smile and then move on : Yes , I know you want that cereal , but you know what the rules are about sweet cereals . That 's just the way it is . " ' This way , you 're not giving in to a request you 've deemed unreasonable but responding to the completely normal underlying frustration . Trickier than whining is its big brother : crying . Parents get caught up trying to quiet wailing both to make their child feel better and to protect their own sanity . But , as with whining , crying does n't always call for more than a simple acknowledgment of what 's behind it , unless it 's due to pain or fear . Suppose your child sobs when the video he 's watching ends and you announce that it 's time for bed-your basic , run-of-the  --  mill " No , I do n't want to go to bed , I want to watch another video ! " scene . Obviously , you do n't want to just give in-it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either . " Tell him you 're sorry he 's sad or angry , and if he feels like crying , it 's okay , and when he 's done , you can read together or cuddle , " suggests Sonnenschein . Then scoop him up and proceed with toothbrushing and getting ready for bed . The bottom line : If the tears are n't caused by a true crisis , do n't treat the outburst like one . Decide beforehand what you will react to Obviously , dangerous activities or violent fights among siblings ca n't be ignored-not even for a moment . Nor can the behavior that you and your partner have agreed beforehand just is n't acceptable . Both of these situations require consistent and immediate attention . And by reacting strongly to only those few things you 've decided are beyond the pale , you increase the impact and the effectiveness of your response . What parents find they simply ca n't ignore differs from family to family , even situation to situation . Carol Colby of Thomaston , Georgia , the mother of two boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tantrumlike screaming , especially in front of others . " When my parents visit , my four-year-old acts up because he thinks I 'm less likely to discipline him in front of them . But it drives me nuts , so I do n't ignore it . I just tell my parents , Okay , I 'm going to deal with this even when you are here so I can change it . ' ' " For others , like Mower , screaming is n't nearly the issue that language has become for her 7-yearold . " It was n't as big a deal when he was little and did n't know what he was saying . But now , when he calls me names , I ca n't ignore it . There 's always a consequence , like no TV . " What you respond to will change over time depending on your child 's age , and even on your own growth as a parent . Engleman-Kemmer admits that until she had her second child , she never ignored anything her first one did . " I just reacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tantrum , and I needed to put the baby in the stroller . I ignored him because it was inconvenient to do anything else , and he just pulled himself together on his own . That 's when I realized I 'd been reinforcing his behavior . " As for my own difficult-to-ignore parenting situations , I 'm still striving for such successes as the baby-banging episode , and I 'm making progress . Anna had been stretching out nap- and bedtime rituals with a litany of requests-a quick snack , one more book-so I began simply acknowledging them but not acting on them . Since then , I 've had her down in record time . The other day , as naptime approached , she screamed and cried that she was n't tired . Fifteen minutes later , having just asked for a drink of water , she was sound asleep in my arms . Sidebar WHEN YOU GET NO REACTION Sidebar " Come clean up your toys , " you call . Once . Twice . A little louder . Once more . No answer . How could she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angrily over to your child to punish her for ignoring you , your first step should be to figure out why you 're not getting a response . It 's possible she really did n't hear you , says Jacqueline Haines , executive director of the Gesell Institute of Human Development , an organization in New Haven , CT , that studies children 's behavior . She could be so engrossed in an activity that she 's totally unaware that you 're calling . But do n't just step in and end the game or turn off the TV , says Haines ; that 's as good as demanding a blowup or a tantrum . Instead , squat down next to her , eye to eye , and explain that in a few minutes , or as soon as she finishes the game , she 'll have to stop what she 's doing and pick up her toys . By Issuing a warning and refocusing her attention , you 're setting up a structure , which will make her more likely to comply . Sometimes , a child may ignore a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commands at a young child all at once , and chances are he wo n't follow any of them . But if you 've made one simple request , you know he heard you , he knows he heard you , and you know he knows he heard you , then it 's time for the countdown-with consequences - if he does n't respond or comply , says Haines . If by the time you count to ten , for instance , he does n't acknowledge your request , then some kind of punishment , such as no video or trip to the playground that afternoon , should follow . - TERESA MARTINEZ Author Affiliation Contributing editor BARBARA ROWLEY is the author of Baby Days : Activities , Ideas , and Games for Enjoying Daily Life With a Child Under Three . // <p>
