Ever wonder why the Amish look so fit ? In an experiment , 100 adults in an Amish farming community in southern Ontario wore pedometers and logged their physical activity for a week . Not surprisingly , the Amish , who favor a 19th century lifestyle , were quite active . The men reported 10 hours of vigorous work a week and averaged 18,425 steps a day . All told , they engaged in six times as much physical activity as did their " modern " counterparts . The bottom line ? Only 4% of the Amish men were obese , vs. 31% of non-Amish men . And this despite plenty of potatoes , gravy , pies and cakes .
