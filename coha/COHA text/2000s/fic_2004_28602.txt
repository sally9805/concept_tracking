Chapter One Tantalizing by Lori Foster Tugging at the hem of her miniskirt , Josie Jackson came the rest of the way into the noisy room . Seeing to the end of the bar was almost impossible in the near darkness with blue-gray smoke clouding everything . But she finally spied a man , his back to her , sitting on the end bar stool , just where he was supposed to be . Brazen , she told herself , trying to get into the part she needed to play . Daring , sexy , confident . She 'd scare the poor man to death and he would n't be able to leave quick enough . Josie had chosen the busy , singles meeting place , hoping that would end it right there . But he 'd surprised her by agreeing with her choice . At least , her sister claimed he 'd agreed . But her sister had also said he was " perfect " for her , which almost guaranteed Josie would n't like him . Susan had described him as responsible . Mature . Settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind dates , and she was even more fed up with the type of man her sister assumed she needed : stuffy , too proper and too concerned with appearances . Men who did n't want anything to do with romance or excitement . All they wanted was to find someone like them so they could marry and get on with their boring lives . She was twenty-five now and had spent most of her life working toward her goals , pleasing her sister with her dedication . Well , she 'd reached those goals , so it was time for other things . Past time . She deserved to have some fun . Bob Morrison may be interested in a nice little house in a nice little neighborhood with a nice little family , but Josie Jackson had other plans , and if the location for this meeting had n't put him off , one look at her would . She sauntered toward him . There was a low whistle behind her , and she felt heat pulse in her cheeks . The next thing she felt - a bold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back out again . Instead she managed to glare at the offender and stay upright on her three-inch heels . No small feat , given that she normally wore sturdy , rubber-soled shoes . She could do this , she told herself , she could ... All thought became suspended as the man turned to face her . Good heavens . Her breath caught somewhere in the region of her throat and refused to budge any farther . She stared . Well . He certainly does n't look stuffy , Josie girl , not in those nice snug jeans and that black polo shirt . This ca n't be the right man . For once , he seemed too ... right , too masculine and attractive and sexy . Definitely sexy . Fate would n't be so cruel as to actually send her a gorgeous , stuffy man . Would it ? She forced herself to take another halting step forward , hampered by the tight miniskirt , the ridiculously high heels and her own reservations . " Bob ? Bob Morrison ? " His dark eyes were almost black , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brow , unkempt , but still very appealing . His gaze went from a slow , enthralled perusal of her mostly bared legs to her midriff where he paused , looking her over from chest to belly , his look almost tactile in its intensity , then he reached her face . He drew in a long breath , apparently feeling as stunned as she did . She waited for him to speak , to do or say something that would prove her assumptions had been correct , that he was n't what she wanted in a man , that he was another typical offering from Susan who was supposed to further domesticate her life . But then he stood , towering over her , six feet of gorgeous , throbbing male , and he smiled . That smile could be lethal , she thought as it sent shivers deep into her belly . The man exuded charm and warmth , and there was absolutely nothing stuffy or uptight about him . In fact , she felt like Jell-O on the inside . Nothing stuffy about that . He held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own and seemed to brand her with his strength and heat . With the type of voice that inspired fantasies , he said , " I 'm ... Bob . It 's very nice to meet you , Josie . " * * * He was n't usually a liar . Nick Harris took in the exquisite female before him and forgave himself . Lying was necessary , even imperative , given the fact he was faced with the most gorgeous , sexy woman imaginable - so close , and yet , not for him . He 'd tell a hundred lies if it would keep her from walking out . Bob would n't appreciate being impersonated , of course , but then , Bob had n't wanted anything to do with her . He 'd been more taken with her sister , that rigid woman who had conspired the entire meeting . What Bob saw in Susan Jackson was beyond Nick , but now he could only be glad . Bob 's preferences in women had Nick sitting here on a Saturday night , prepared to make excuses for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . If he had n't , he might have missed her , and she was well worth the football tickets he 'd wasted . She was well worth giving up all sports . She looked surprised , as surprised as he felt , her green eyes wide , her soft mouth slightly open . Her full lips were painted a shiny red , and he could see her pink tongue just behind her teeth . Damn , the things he 'd like to do with that tongue .... Belatedly his manners kicked in . " Would you like to sit down ? " Normally he was known as a gentleman , as a reasonable man , sane and intelligent and given to bouts of outstanding charm . But he felt as though he 'd just been poleaxed . And it only got worse as she flipped her long silky red hair over her shoulder , shrugged , then lifted her shapely bottom onto the bar stool next to his . That bottom held his spellbound attention for a few moments , before he could finally pull his gaze away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was , revealed slender thighs . She crossed her legs , swinging one high-heel clad foot . He swallowed , heard himself do it and told himself to get a grip . He could n't let her see how she 'd affected him . " Can I get you something to drink ? " She hesitated , and he could almost see her considering , but then she shook her head . Those sexy green eyes of hers slanted his way , teasing , flirting , causing his muscles to twitch . " There 's a lot of things I do , but drinking is n't one of them . " It took him a second to recover from that look and the outrageous words she 'd spoken . He hoped to hell he 'd interpreted them right . " Oh ? Religious reasons ? Diet ? " Her lips curved and her long lashes lowered . " I just like to have control at all times . I want to know exactly what I 'm doing , how I 'm doing it and who I 'm doing it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke , a pink flush spread from her cheeks to her throat to the top of her chest , where the scooped neckline of her blouse showed just a hint of cleavage . Light freckles were sprinkled there , like tiny decorations , making him wonder where other freckles might be . He 'd heard things about redheads , but he 'd always discounted them as fantasy , nothing more . Now he had to reassess . This redhead seemed to exude sensuality with her every breath . And he was getting hotter than a chili pepper just looking at her . He 'd have to wrest control from her , despite her just-stated preferences , if he wanted to survive . Never had he let a woman get the upper hand in any situation , not since he 'd been a teenager and his stepmother had taken over his life . He did n't intend to let this little woman , no matter how appealing she was , call the shots . Not even if those shots might be to his liking . She 'd temporarily thrown him , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to breathing her musky scent and hearing her throaty , quiet voice . And she kept peeking looks at him , as if she were shy , which could n't be , not looking the way she looked . Or maybe she was feeling just as attracted as he was . That should work to his advantage . At least he 'd know he was n't drowning alone . ( Continues ... )
