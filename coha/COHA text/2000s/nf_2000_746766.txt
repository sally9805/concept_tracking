In the following article , Janice Ross addresses both a problem and an opportunity , one that confronts all of us interested in the educational contributions of the arts . The problem and opportunity I speak of is the desire , on the one hand , to get the arts into school programs by appealing to justifications that are attractive to those outside of the arts but which are themselves extra-artistic  --  higher SAT scores , increased standardized achievement test scores , better spatial reasoning , and the like . On the other hand , we want to avoid undermining the distinctive contributions of the arts to education by appealing to justifications that other fields can achieve . In our efforts to provide " practical " justifications for the educational values of the arts , we stretch  --  and in our effort , we risk marginalizing  --  the qualities of experience and the distinctive forms of meaning that the arts make possible . At the same time , there may be some very real benefits to the forms of thinking that the arts , when well taught , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the practical benefits of refined forms of cognition and commitment to what the arts have historically been about in the human community . <p> How arts educators will respond to the growing interest among neuroscientists , psychologists , and other new Columbuses in the arts remains to be seen . At the moment , from my perspective , the less thoughtful among us are all too eager to hop aboard the bandwagon . I believe , and clearly Janice Ross believes , that we should exercise prudence , even caution . <p> Although her article focuses on dance , the field of her expertise , her message pertains to all the arts . In the end we need to be in a position to claim what we can legitimately claim without selling out what is at the heart of the arts . Janice Ross 's essay helps us recognize the rocks and shoals while avoiding a mindless protectionism that will serve neither the arts nor our children very well .  --  Elliot Eisner Stanford University <p> <p> The era that just concluded  --  people debate its length  --  has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( n1 ) " the Most Amazing Century of Science , " ( n2 ) " the Information Age , " and the epoch of the " Knowledge Economy . " ( n3 ) What underlies all these labels is an intense focus on the human mind and how it works in its physical context . The educational implications of these changes have been particularly emphasized as researchers try to understand how best to prepare the current and next generations for the demands of this new century . <p> Although dance has long been at the margins of American educational concerns , it may soon be poised to enter the mainstream because of shifts in how the arts are coming to be regarded by our new knowledge economy . Historically , dance 's place in the educational as well as the philosophical agenda of the West has always been on the fringes of the other arts . Dance has many things against it , foremost among which is that it uses the body as its primary medium . Not mediated , as theatre and music are , by speech , vocalization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a living medium replete with all the complex and difficult issues of sexuality , gender , and society . The body is the one thing about which we have both subjective and objective experience , and it is essential to traverse this divide as a first step in seeing the body as an art medium in dance . The Arts , Cognition , and Education <p> The reasons for the historically low regard for dance in the Western theatrical tradition are many . Its major practitioners have customarily been female , more so than in any other art form . As an art form , dance is fleetingly temporal , leaving no artifacts other than an occasional critical review , an impression in the spectator 's mind , and a kinesthetic and visual memory for the choreographer and dancers . Consequently , building a legacy and critical repertory of work has been difficult if not impossible until the advent of affordable film and video in the mid-twentieth century . The irony of this is compounded if one considers that dance is one of the most basic and oldest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed out on being included in the educational agenda of America 's K-12 schools . This has occurred for the same reason that it has failed to achieve what aesthetician Francis Sparshott sees as culturally essential for any art form to generate a philosophy : " It is necessary that the art should occupy at the relevant time a culturally central position or that the ideology of the art should be integrated with a culturally prevalent ideology . " ( n4 ) <p> The twentieth century made significant strides in moving the body into a more central cultural position as society has become more comfortable with issues of fitness , health , and sexuality . Abetting this shift for dance in the educational arena is the fact that we are currently searching intensely for new theoretical models and methods for addressing the production , structure , and exchange of knowledge . Increasingly the arts are being pulled into these discussions . This article will explore why this is so and what the implications are for arts education in general and dance education in particular . <p> This focus on the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by three important changes : <p> First , technology dominates our present era , in which the control of information and knowledge creates wealth and power . In past eras , control of finances , buildings , precious metals , or land meant wealth and power , but these are no longer the only means of attaining such goals . <p> Second , the human body , its genetic structure , and the brain and the mechanics of cognition have become the focus of major scientific , medical , and educational research . The twentieth century began with suspicion and anxiety about the strength and resilience of the human body in the face of social , industrial , and educational demands . We ended the century confident of the body 's durability . Now that the body is perceived as strong , there is much more boldness in acknowledging its connection to the mind and the tightness of this unity . These developments have profound resonance for arts education and particularly for dance education . <p> Third , the accelerating speed of information flow threatens to outstrip existing models and methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompted to rethink educational theory and to reform educational practice as the workforce faces hard questions about its preparation . The preparation of the next generation in our increasingly globalized and high tech world has become even more problematic . The meaning and purpose of schooling are shifting as never before . Mind-Body and the Arts ? <p> The arts have always existed in the province of ideas and their communication . As John Dewey delineated in his Art as Experience , all complete experience proceeds through a series of stages beginning with " impulsion , " then conception , a long period of gestation , transformation of material , execution , realization , and finally expression. ( n5 ) <p> Dance , for example , involves the construction of narrative out of abstract symbols and gestures . Next is the display of this form , presumably rich with communicative possibilities , to an audience . The process of making meaning is as real for the spectator who perceives the work , as well as the artists  --  the choreographer and dancers who envision and embody it . The artists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , and rendering it an art medium , one as expressive as composed sounds , chiseled marble , or the traces of a paint brush saturated with oil paint stroked across a canvas . <p> One significant force at work in this bringing of dance into a more central focus is the fact that the boundaries of academic disciplines are being rendered increasingly permeable . The arts are being explored , emulated , and appropriated by other humanities and social science disciplines in an unprecedented manner . Harvard English professor and cultural critic Marjorie Garber has dubbed this practice of one discipline modeling itself on another " discipline envy , " casting this covetousness as Freudian in its fascination with the attributes of a companion field. ( n6 ) Indeed , the arts have often been the targets rather than the instigators of methodological borrowing by other disciplines . In recent years this has only accelerated as more of the recondite aspects of creation , transformation , and critical perception in the arts have been researched , analyzed , and made accessible to those outside the field . <p> One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to emphasize distinctions between the various art forms . With the announcement of the so-called Mozart Effect , music ( primarily Western classical music ) has been positioned by some as the most valuable art form to use educationally to advance spatial and temporal reasoning. ( n7 ) <p> Literature however , put its bid in first . For example , in 1996 Mark Turner , a professor of English at the University of Maryland , put forward a proposal for literature as the art form with the best paradigm for understanding human cognition and the origins of thought and consciousness . " If we want to study the everyday mind , we can begin by turning to the literary mind exactly because the everyday mind is essentially literary , " he asserts in his ambitiously titled book The Literary Mind : The Origins of Thought and Language. ( n8 ) <p> Turner 's carefully worked argument rests upon his contention that the fundamental instrument of rational thought is narrative imaging or storytelling , and that it is a literary capacity indispensable to human cognition in general . His rationale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in locating this narrative-making capacity only in literature . All of the arts , in their own distinctive ways , are concerned with narrative , with constructing symbols out of which the viewer and audience come to understanding . <p> One might easily argue dance into a central place in Turner 's model as well . For example , he supports his belief that storytelling is a primary way we negotiate the world by rooting it in the physical . " Walking and running are marvels of the brain 's ability to compose and execute motor sequence , " he writes . " Most of our actions consist of executing small spatial stories " ( 18 ) . This physicalizing of information is framed as both comprehensive and fundamental . " Nonspatial stories are always grounded in spatial and bodily stories , " he asserts ( 51 ) The fact that Turner locates this capacity to make stories and narrative exclusively in the verbal , while acknowledging its bodily kinesthetic dimensions , seems an arbitrary and chauvinistic divide between these two art forms , to say nothing of poetry and drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kinesthetic . <p> Explorations of the arts ' attributes and aspects are happening at a rapid pace outside the field as well . Increasingly the performing arts are being regarded as educational models for pragmatic practices , such as how the business world might operate to maximize its knowledge capital . For example , at Duke University , Bruce Payne , a faculty member in public policy and ethics , teaches a popular class about business and leadership that involves a semester of residence in New York . Here Payne and his Duke students observe more than fifty Broadway shows , operas , ballets , and museum and gallery exhibitions . In addition , his class curriculum includes having the class talk to dancers , producers , writers , directors , entertainment lawyers , philanthropists , business leaders , painters , curators , and even an astrophysicist about how they , as leaders , inspire , innovate , and take risks in collaborative ventures  --  ventures that ideally coalesce into smoothly orchestrated events. ( n9 ) <p> Payne has structured his curriculum on the premise that management and leadership skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who grapple regularly with temperamental employees , crushing deadlines , restricted budgets , and the continual challenge of marketing a short-lived product to a fickle base of consumers who have to be wooed anew each time . " The performing arts have always had to do more with less , " says Payne . " All arts are essentially entrepreneurial " ( 242 ) . Viewed through this strict lens of the business world , these Duke students have a curious immersion experience in the arts but not necessarily about the arts . Most plan on becoming lawyers , teachers , or psychologists , according to an article in Fast Company magazine about the class ( 246 ) . One has the sense that these students ' interest in these performing arts is steadily steered toward the practical and pragmatic  --  the ways in which the arts coincidentally mirror successful start-ups . According to Payne , <p> In the new world of corporate America , everybody is worried about how to achieve excellence in smaller and flatter organizations . That means finding styles of leadership that work well with smart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well  --  and these days , it works less well than ever  --  what styles of leadership really make the most sense ? The people who succeed in the arts these days are people who have solved that problem . They know how to coach , they know how to encourage , they know how to praise , they know how to love . And they know how to express a vision that excites rather than intimidates. ( 242 ) <p> The two models put forth by Turner and Payne do , in fact , delineate wonderfully useful features of the literary and performing arts , but they are just that  --  features  --  part of a much more complex whole , an administrative scaffolding that makes possible the full realization and sharing of an artist 's vision . That vision however , with its sources , tensions , challenges , pleasures , and meanings , is rendered secondary , or even unacknowledged , in the face of the perception of the choreographer or director as a venture capitalist with a snappy , nonprofit product or of the writer as emblematic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be shown that immersion in the arts has consequences for business and for spatial reasoning that make a difference in culturally important tasks . For the present , the claim exceeds the evidence . <p> Not long ago , in the 1980s  --  during the bust following the 1960s boom of the performing arts in America  --  arts organizations were doing the borrowing , emulating the jargon of the world of big business . Dance groups , for example , saw themselves as quasi-corporate institutions , with five-year plans , long-range strategies , boards of directors , real estate holdings , and revenue-producing plans . The full corporate mentality was not emulated , but the structure that facilitated or enabled it was . In many respects , this seems to be a clear parallel to the pragmatic uses to which education is now putting the arts in curricular contexts like Professor Payne 's leadership class at Duke . <p> However , there is a profound difference . The business model of how to produce , market , and sell a product is comparatively content-free . It is a neutral set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the arts , too , have discovered that there are liabilities to a corporate mentality . Boards can look at the bottom line too much , and the stage too little , so that box office can often count more than successful expression . In the arts the reverse is true . It is the merits of the artistic product that confirm the effectiveness and integrity of the team effort it takes to produce it . The process is not independent of the product , and often it is the passion for the product that makes the process work . <p> In the educational arena , when this kind of borrowing takes place , the arts are usually are shortchanged . The implications can be the most profound for K-12 arts teaching because , with no established long-standing curriculum in place , and with fewer real artists teaching the courses , the values that are assigned to the arts may be corporate more than aesthetic , prosaic more than imaginative , practical more than emotional . <p> The process of cognition in arts work , and explorations about the kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a focus for many arts education researchers. ( n10 ) Educators are exploring the nature of thinking in the arts as paradigms for " good " thinking that might be modeled for other disciplines and populations in society . This is a laudable enterprise , but one also fraught with risks . <p> Proponents of the " Mozart Effect " claim that the pattern-recognition abilities necessary for musical processing  --  and particularly processing the elegant use of symmetry and natural sequences of patterns in the music of W. A. Mozart  --  can enhance abilities for spatial/temporal reasoning . Such a claim makes the arts seem like an unmined gold field of educational short cuts. ( n11 ) This kind of spatial/temporal reasoning , of course , is thought to be essential in engineering , higher mathematics , architecture , and design  --  practices usually deemed socially more important than processing music . <p> The trouble is that each such claim seems to emphasize a different , often behavioral rather than aesthetic attribute of an art form . For example , a recent document about the newly formed National Commission on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centered in its capacity to address " the most urgent void in our present system  --  absence of self-discipline. " ( n12 ) Clearly music does much more than that , but such a claim could provide persuasive educational justification for some seeking more discipline , and the fact that music was the vehicle could become incidental . Marginalized School Populations and Somatic Education <p> Some of the most active new arts education programs can be found in schools and after-school activities in communities with large populations of low-income and at-risk youths. ( n13 ) While the availability of arts classes has declined in public schools across the nation in the last three decades , arts offerings for the students who are on the margins ( economically and socially ) are increasing . One reason may be that this has been a low-profile area for researchers to test new models of arts education with a population that does not receive the intense attention that mainstream , middle class public schools do . Also , failure means only that things stay they same ; they ca n't get much worse , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the persistent belief that those students can engage with the arts more readily , since they are freer of language as a mediator of understanding and achievement . The notion of the physical as a back door to higher understanding has long dogged dance in education . In fact , fin de siecle America saw a whole movement to instill morals in youths through organized physical exercise . This " muscles and morals " approach to physical education was founded on the belief that moral values of fair play , the success of the fittest , and learning to lose gracefully were important Christian and capitalist values that could effectively be instilled in a broad and unevenly educated population through competitive sports. ( n14 ) <p> Some of this same thinking shadows arts programs for at-risk youths today . Currently two juvenile jails in California , San Jose 's Juvenile Hall and San Mateo 's Hillcrest Juvenile Hall , offer weekly dance classes to incarcerated male and female teens . Taught by an Israeli jazz dancer , Ehud Krauss , these classes are enormously popular among the staff and inmates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area for dance education . Recent interviews with several students who have been taking jazz dance <p> classes reveal that for many it is the supportive , patient attention of a caring adult that affects them most profoundly ; it is the first benefit that they list from having a dance class in their lives . It is not coincidental that dance supplies this for at-risk youth , for the very act of teaching a phrase of movement , observing closely how the students ' bodies are responding to the instructions , and how accurately they reflect the movement phrase that is being taught , are common features of a dance class . In the context of often ignored youth , this level of attention can register as care , concern , and interest in them as individuals as well . One fifteen-year-old woman , who has been incarcerated repeatedly for drug and probation offenses in San Jose 's Juvenile Hall since she was eleven , said of the jazz dance instructor in Juvenile Hall , " A lot of minors here do n't like authority figures . But taking this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get along with adults . He treats us like human beings , not like we are in here . " ( n15 ) <p> Interviews with several of these incarcerated teens about the jail dance class reveal how this regard for the body in dance also affects their own awareness of other inmates ' physical abilities in the dance class . It has altered the way that one inmate responds to another , even if they are from a rival gang , as is often the case . The result is , at least temporarily , a softened approach to differences outside of class . Animosities run deep among the rival gangs incarcerated in the felon wing of Juvenile Hall , yet several inmates spoke of their jazz dance class as teaching them how to get along with other people , particularly people they do n't like . " You see that not everyone can learn the same , " remarked a seventeen-year-old boy who has spent the last two-and-one-half years behind bars . " Now when I see new people who ca n't learn , I show them step by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance class is helping me get along with other people because when you are dancing you 've got to get along with other people . Later on sometimes I even talk to them some after class , " he says , referring to rivals with whom contact customarily means a fight in the outside world . <p> An important dance-based lesson is being learned here  --  that dance involves training perceptual acuity for the performer as well as for all observers from the teacher to the audience . One can not fashion his body into a responsive physical medium until he becomes attuned to some of the nuances of motion and emotion and some of the pathways between physical form and emotional awareness and then expression . For example , it can be humbling to see even an enemy grapple with the same fundamental limitations and challenges of shaping his body to do a fast-moving grapevine jazz step of interlacing footsteps to the side . Patience , and sometimes even compassion , can be social by-products of this aesthetic engagement and new regard for the human body that dance can introduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits from a basketball game , the incarcerated teens answered that the stress release that physical activity provides might be similar but that the other dimensions would be missing . They did not know why . One reason is that sports foster teamwork , but also competition , in a very different way than the performing arts do . In dance one competes with oneself and an imagined image of one 's body as the desired expressive medium . In sports the competition is more externalized , signified by score keeping and a winning and losing divide between the participants . One group functions as an ensemble in a quest to outdo the other . In an arts organization such as a dance company , the pulling together does n't need an external enemy for impetus ; the desire is expression , not conquest . Some Implications for Arts Education <p> Recently arguments for dance and arts education have shifted from an approach that suggests they are waiting to be invited into the curriculum to forcing the issue by enumerating each art form 's unique benefits to education . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the analogy between literature and dance , and " muscles and morals , " or engaging the bodies of at-risk youths . The field of arts education has spent the last three decades arguing itself back into the nation 's curricula , and we now have a group arsenal of reasons and promises for what we can bring to the nurturing and intellectual growth of America 's youth . But often in our desperation to have the arts included we emphasize attributes that may not be central to what experience in art is all about . <p> The implications of these changes for arts education are profound . To summarize , the enthroning of knowledge will undoubtedly have wide ramifications for arts education . We need to be vigilant that the arts are not used and valued primarily for their non-art attributes . We also need to be more proactive . The past three decades of decline in public support for the arts in all aspects of our society , educational as well as cultural , have taught us not to sit quietly and wait to be invited back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasize our own utility and importance and establish our own hierarchy of arts values in each discipline and across arts disciplines . We must also learn to be comfortable with the arts ' capacity for inciting controversy and not try to stifle it . <p> The arts as cultural texts are not and will never be politically neutral . As Henry Giroux repeatedly warns , to a greater or lesser degree most cultural texts are produced , engaged , distributed , and sustained to secure particular forms of authority. ( n16 ) We need to be mindful of this , and , rather than ignore it , use it to our advantage . This leads to a final observation . Eliminating the arts has not served society or the arts . Neither has it served our nation 's educational agenda . <p> The twenty-first century has begun with what is arguably the most important educational conversation in which the arts have been engaged , the new discussion of a knowledge economy and cognition and the arts . The challenge is to use it to secure our agenda  --  not that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that other disciplines can do just as well . We must seek our future envisioning a unity of arts practices as rooted in the fundamental experience of somatic knowledge . Here , in particular , dance has much to offer , for it is one of the least understood of the art forms and one of the most readily discounted as not having educational or cognitive value . Yet the thinking body is at the intersection of key concerns in education , society , and cognition . <p> The body is likely to become increasingly important in the era ahead  --  the thinking body in particular . Our cognitive processes gather data through the body  --  its senses , sensibilities , and physical dimensions . The arts are firmly rooted in these exchanges between the psyche ( mind ) and soma ( body ) , and the senses and emotions are the conduits of these experiences . The five senses are apertures to the outside ; the are also portals to the processes of cognition . In their finest practice , so too are the arts . <p>    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
