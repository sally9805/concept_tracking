NIGEL HAD N'T REALISED BEFORE how cinematic it was to crash a car . There was that moment of swerving and squealing brakes . The jolt of the impact and the sudden flipping upside down ; a scraping of metal and a shattering of glass . And then voices in the darkness telling him to lie still and not move . Just like the cinema . It was almost gratifying to wipe his cuff-linked sleeve across his forehead and find it covered in blood . Perhaps he 'd been unconscious , perhaps not , but it seemed as though he saw the rotating red and blue lights of the police car flashing through his cracked windscreen almost immediately . Damned efficient , these Americans . He envisaged himself in the Dawn Patrol , trapped in his inverted biplane , crash-landed on the fields of France . He fiddled with the seat belt , and finally snapped it free so that his body slumped down on his neck and squeezed him against the roof of the car . A torch sprayed him in a beam of light . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kind and scared . The torch switched off . He saw the door on the passenger 's side was a quarter of the way open and crushed into an irregular parallelogram . There was no glass left in the window . It was twinkling beyond in the moonlight , like frost on the cobbles at Sandhurst all those years ago . He rested calmly in his awkward position . He heard tyres rolling slowly nearby , munching gravel , and scratchy , mechanical voices trading information over radiosreminding him of nothing so much as the urban equivalent of the squawking junglebirds in Katanga . The passenger door was shoved open , scraping noisily along the tarmac . And somehow , in his muddled state he frankly did n't notice how , he was dragged from the car , strapped on a stretcher , and slid neatly into an ambulance . It was odd , but the first thing he noticed was its cleanliness . He 'd seen plenty of ambulances in less than perfect circumstances , but even given the advantages of peace , the Americans were a remarkably clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One had grown used to the idea that the Americans were rather hysterical , given to mass panics and strange fears that they might never find the secret of eternal life . But the male nurse in the ambulance seemed quite friendly and calm as he put him through the usual preliminariestaking his blood pressure , shooting something into his veins , and wrapping a cloth brace around his neck . When they snapped Nigel out of the ambulance and into the hospital , he was told he was going into some section reserved for non-emergency accident cases . He was not , evidently , in so very bad a shape as one might expect of a man who had recently celebrated his sixtieth birthday and survived a car wreck . And it was a good thing he was n't in bad shape , because once the nurses had laced him onto a flat , uncomfortable slab , and incarcerated him in a rather more severe neck brace than the one he 'd had in the ambulance , he was left completely alone . He could hear the voices of nurses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him . After about two hours , a young doctor with owlish glasses , a white smock , and tennis shoes wrapped in plastic carrier bags shuffled in to lecture him on the evils of drink , mysteriously noted something in the file at the foot of his slab , and wandered off again . Good Lord , thought Nigelentertaining the pleasant idea that he 'd been thrown from a horse rather than written off his car ( a rent-a-car at that ) have I ridden with Prince Rupert 's right wing at Naseby only to fall wounded and a prisoner to the dreaded Roundheads ? It certainly seemed that way , for his next visitor was a uniformed member of Cromwell 's New Model Army , a large , suntanned young man with blond hair shaved close to his heada fine figure of the California Highway Patrol Regiment . It seemed to Nigel that sometime in his career he had received training on how to handle interrogations when captured by the enemy . But never before had he been captured , and he could n't remember the drill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and serial number . After that , it was all rather vague . He was shocked when he saw the Cromwellian Californian flipping through his wallet . How on earth did he get that ? An Englishman , huh ? ' he said , looking vaguely and dangerously German , Nigel thought , with his chiselled Gothic face . His air was cocky and amused , as it might well be when one 's opponent is chained to a mad scientist 's operating table . Yes , ' Nigel croaked . His throat was dry . He shifted uncomfortably under his bonds . The officer nodded and puckered his lips a little before widening them into an arrogant grin . Kinda old for this sort of thing , aren'tch ya ? ' It was a question to which there was no answer ; and Nigel gave none . The officer seemed disappointed . Technically , ' he went on , shifting his weight in a manner that seemed to imply his sidearm was remarkably heavy , like a handheld Gatling gun , you 're under arrest for driving under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a western gunfighter to the foot of the bed and came back with a clipboard in his hand . He shook his head . Man , your brain was fried . ' Nigel 's mouth grimaced under his grey moustache . Insolent little puppy , he thought . Damned self-righteous , bronzed Puritan . The officer stuck his tongue in his cheek . But then again , you guys do drive on the wrong side of the road , don'tch ya ? ' Nigel 's grimace twisted itself into a forced , false rictus . Damned little whelp ... Well , anyway , ' the officer said , turning businesslike , you 're technically under arrest , as I said , but you 'll be free to go once they check you out of here . It 'll be up to the D.A . whether to issue a warrant for your arrest . You live in England , right ? ' Yes , an England whose crown we 'll defend to the last man against you and all of your republican kin , you vile dogs , Nigel said to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . To the officer he only nodded as best he could given the constraints of the neck brace . Well , as long as you 're out of the States within a week or so , I do n't think the D.A . will think it 's worth the taxpayers ' money to bring you back for trial . After all , nobody was hurt but you . And you 're damn lucky about that . You drunk drivers usually always live . It 's the people you hit that get killed . ' Oh , yes , yes , thank you very much , Carrie Nation . If only you knew why I was here . Doing a policeman 's work myself and doing it a damned sight more considerately than you , you Levelling , surfing , Teutonic moron . I 'll still have to file a report , of course , ' the officer said , pulling out his notebook . Yes , very big on reports , your kind , are n't they ? Are you in the States for business or pleasure ? ' Pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . ' You 're on vacation ? ' Nigel grunted . No need to lie unnecessarily . Where exactly were you goingbefore you went off the road , that is ? ' To my hotel . ' And which one is that ? ' Oh , you know , the big one with the French name . ' Too drunk to know where he was going , ' the officer said slowly , scribbling in his notebook . Where 'd you been drinking ? ' I believe you Californians call it a saloon . ' A saloon , ' the officer repeated , smirking . And you do n't remember the name , do you ... ? ' The " Billy the Kid " or something ... ' ... or who you were with ? ' With ? I was n't with anyone . I do n't know anyone here . ' The officer nodded . Suspect completely disoriented , ' he said as he wrote . I think the skid marks tell the rest of the story . ' He put his notebook in his pocket . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all four tyres and bent the wheel stems . I hope you have insurance on it . ' I have . ' Nigel was enough of an old soldier to know the risks he was running on this mission , though he had n't considered drink driving to be one of them . Good . That could have ruined your trip , otherwise . ' He grinned again . You know , my grandfather 's been to England . He was there to bail you out during the war . ' Was he really ? ' Nigel said in mock politeness , flat on his back and unable to move . Yeah . He thought it was cold . ' Cept the beerthat was warm . ' Nigel nodded thoughtfully . Give him my apologies . But tell him it 's been that way for quite some time . ' Cromwell 's grinning constable took another look in Nigel 's wallet , then flipped it closed . I 'll leave this with the nurses . You can pick it up when you leave . ' He waved it at Nigel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be gnarly . ' Yes , ca n't they just , ' Nigel said , his fake grin following the officer out of the room . Well , he 'd survived the interrogation , but now came the true torture that all captured soldiers risked . Torture was what they gave you after you refused to talk . He braced himself for it . In fact , strapped down as he was , he was already braced for it . His first fright came when a nurse stopped by his bed to ask him about paymentalways an awkward question when one finds oneself unexpectedly in a foreign hospital , especially when the authorities have confiscated one 's wallet . But he was relieved that his being a foreigner did n't seem to cause her any anguish . Like a true die-hard , anti-Reform Bill Tory back in 1832 , Nigel had always distrusted the National Health Service at home . He 'd been all of eight when Nye Bevan introduced the idea . He had n't thought much of it then and he did n't think much of it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an American hospital would either turn him away to die in an alley or take him by his countryman brogues and shake him down for everything he was worth . Taking matters quickly into his own hands he got the nurse to wheel his bed to where the phone was mounted on the opposite wall . He dialled his bank in London , Messrs Coutts , announced himself , and handed her the receiver . ( The nurse , he thought , was rather plain and decidedly craggy with age and he 'd rather not have her face rubbing cheeks with his . ) The clerk on the other end assured her that Nigel 's account was in very good order . She rang off , and Nigel gave the nurse his address so he could be billed and granted her permission to copy down his bank card number as security . It was quite simple , if more mercenary than one would like from a medical establishment , which , one likes to assume , no doubt falsely , is a rather idealistic place , with Angels of Mercy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , Nigel thought to himself , given that they already had his wallet in their custody , they could be gracious rather easily . The next torture to be borne was more severe . This torture was n't clever , like Chinese water torture . It was more neglectful , more modern , more bureaucratic ; in fact , it was very much like the National Health Service . He was left strapped on his mad scientist 's operating table , ignored , abandoned , and alone . He lay on his rack for a good twelve hours in a position that rapidly became far more painful than the quick and irrevocable accident that had sent him there . Whenever he tried to move , the apparatus blocked him . It was like trying to roll over in bed , only to have Helga of the SS pin his shoulders back , saying , You vill sleep on your back and you vill like it . ' It would be wrong to say that he was being kept under observation , for he was barely observed at all . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X-rayedwhich they did twice , because the first batch did n't come out properlyand to stitch up a cut near his eye . Nigel had n't been seriously injured before he entered the hospital , but by the time he leftwhen a doctor happened upon him and said , Hmm , they have n't let you out yet . That 's funny . ' his spine felt as though it were about to snap . When he was finally discharged and in receipt of his confiscated valuables , he stepped into the remarkably hot October suna portrait of elegant , unclimatic dishevelment : blood-spattered cavalry twill , a Frankenstein-monster scar on his forehead , and a swollen black eye that he tried to hide by giving his Panama a rakish tilt . He knew he was not a pretty picture . And at his age he knew it would be a bit hard to claim it was all a result of a stirring round of fisticuffshis glory days as a pugilist for Eton were long behind him . But it was a very pretty picture that had plunged him into this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leg , actually . Or rather , two pairs of legs , belonging to two young women who were the very embodiment of a Come to California ' tourist advertisement . He remembered walking down a sunbaked street lined with flashy shops , coming to an outdoor caf , where his eye was caught by the long , suntanned leg of a beautiful blonde whose face had what he assumed was called an innocent , all-American look . ' Plan A , thought Nigel . Whenever , in his long and distinguished military career , he had had to do a recce up country , in darkest Katanga or the border country round Crossmaglen , he 'd invariably enlist native support to help him catch his prey . There was Ngube Mboto , who 'd led him to the Katanga rebels , whom he secretlyand rather dangerously for his career as a wet-behind-the-ears lieutenant and military observeradvised in their secessionist war against the Congo 's communist government ; and Paddy O'Rourke , who drank with the Provos . These two lovelies might well serve the same purpose . Except the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or keeping a close eye on the IRA , but recovering his own goddaughter . She was twentysomething ; these girls were twenty-something . Perfect . Plan A. As he passed the blonde , he touched his Panama in greeting . He then walked straight into a chair that was shoved in his way by a woman getting up at the next table . Nigel remembered feeling momentarily quite proud that though he was stumbling in a strange , hopping , froglike sort of way , his hands skipping along the ground , propelling him forward if not upright , he had n't yet fallen flat on his face . He did , however , propel himself full force into an unoccupied table , bringing it crashing to the ground , its umbrella , a chair , cutlery , salt and pepper shakers , packets of sugar , and other odds and ends falling on top of him . A purple ceramic vase with a single colourful flower plopped on his lap . He quickly brushed it aside so that it shattered on the pavement into convenient shards for cutting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vase 's water had spilled out into a Rorschach ink blot on the crotch of his trousers , which quickly emitted a sheepish smell to match the sheepish look on his face . He heard a woman say , Oh my God ' ( it was the woman who had knocked him over ) , and he groaned a bit . He was much too old to be playing rugby with furniture on the pavement , his erstwhile fame as scrum half for Eton but a distant memory . Surely a few bones were broken . Perhaps he was paralysed . He shut his eyes for a moment , making a quick mental catalogue of his pain before he decided to move . When he opened his eyes , he was surrounded by the sound of shoe leather scraping on the pavement and the umbrella being wrenched aside . The blonde siren knelt beside him and put her hand on his Panama . Do n't move , ' she said to him . Are you all right ? Do you want me to call an ambulance ? ' No , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear of causing even more of a scene . I 'm quite all right . Really , it 's my own damn fault for not looking where I was going . ' Are you sure ? ' Quite sure . ' You 're sure nothing 's broken ? ' Yes . ' The blonde nodded to a very pretty brunette , and they each took an arm and helped him up . He came to a wavering upright position . They let his arms go slowly and stood by him , as though he were a babe who might tumble over . Plan A was working perfectly . Silly old limey duffer , completely out of his depth , needs help . He could practically read the advert in the local paper . Ah , there , ' he said , feeling more unsteady than he wanted to let on . He spread his legs a bit to improve his balance . The woman who 'd broadsided him rushed towards him with profuse apologies . No wonder she 'd capsized him . It was like a hippo ramming a puntthe latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of physics determined he was no match for Hermione the hippo 's well-fed bulk . Yes , I 'm fine . Please , I 'm perfectly fine . I do it all the time . No peripheral vision at all . Always knocking things over . Really . Perfectly , perfectly fine . ' Roar as solicitously as she could , Nigel had no interest in pursuing a conversation with this emigrant from Lake Victoria , and bravely , if gently , brushed her aside , the way a daring crocodile might , and moved boldly to his original objectivethe blonde , who had retreated to her table with her friend . An officer ought always to take the initiative , he thought . What was it Frederick the Great had said ? An officer awaiting an attack shall be cashiered . ' This was especially true when on special operations . It was , after all , imperative to secure the loyalty of the locals . May I join you ? ' he asked , bowing slightly at the waist , interrupting the blonde and brunette , who had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her lazy , bedroom blue eyes lighting with apparent deep concern for Nigel 's well-being . Oh , yes . ' I 'm sorry about all this . But I think I need a bit of a rest . ' He slowly lowered himself into a chair . He was pleased his bones did n't creak as he did so . A young waiter with shiny black hair hurried to their table , his worried eyes watching a couple of Mexican busboys cleaning up the wreckage from Nigel 's fall . Are you all right , sir ? Shall I call a doctor ? ' No , no , I 'm perfectly fine , ' said Nigel , who could n't help but consider the waiter a damned nuisance . He had a sun-drenched table with two beautiful young women . What the devil did he need with a pretty-boy waiter with slicked-back hair ? Can I get you anything ? A glass of water ? ' You can bring me a beer . ' The waiter recited the dozen beers of the house . A Bass will do me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were happy enough sipping their fizzy cola drinks , as Americans were wont to do . Nigel felt fairly knowledgeable about Americans from his days cooperating with them ousting the Iraqis from Kuwait . Many were the hours he 'd sat in the Pentagon with Schwarzkopf and Powell breaking pencil nubs and working out the finer points of the Mother of All Battles . He had to admit to being a little hurt when Stormin ' Norman gave all the credit for the Gulf War to the tactics of Alexander the Great and not so much as a mention to Nigel the Pretty Good Really . But the last laugh was his now , was n't it ? While Schwarzkopf and Powell were reduced to attending old soldiers ' reunions or dull , formal dinners with desiccated , boring foreign policy mandarins , here was Nigel enjoying the caf life with two radiant , sun-kissed creatures . You must be from England , ' said the brunette . Yes , yes I am . ' Apart from acknowledging her amazing powers of deduction , he also carefully noted her features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him of animals rather than peoplestill , hers seemed affectionate , beautiful doe eyes ; a bright , welcoming smile ; a walnut tan ... I 'm April , ' she said , and this is Penelope . ' I 'm pleased to meet you both . My name is Nigel , Nigel Haversham . ' Are you all right ? That was quite a fall you had . ' Oh , yes . I suppose I was rather blinded by the sun . In England , we usually have rain in Octoberand every other month of the year . ' Would you like something to eat ? ' asked Penelope . We have n't ordered yet . ' Oh , have n't you ? ' he said , accepting the menu from her hand . He looked at it briefly and put it aside . Looking at Penelope was more interesting : tall , blonde , and beautiful , with pouting lips , and eyelids that rested half unfurled , reminding one of the joys of the long Norwegian winters . It gets rather warm here in L.A. , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collar . Yes , ' she said , smiling politely . Nigel shook with a violent cough . Are you sure you 're all right ? ' she asked him . Yes , I think it 's just the smog . ' He coughed again in wrenching spasms . Good Lord , did I dislodge my intestines ? ( Continues ... )
