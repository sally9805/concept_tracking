<p> LEWES , ENGLAND - This small town in the green rolling hills near the southern coast of England would be a lovely place to live if it were n't for the exploding parking meters . <p> Things are peaceful here for the most part . Tourists come for the 500-year-old architecture , the famous castle , the memorable views of the countryside known as the South Downs and the unique shops that line the winding streets . <p> But there is a darker side to Lewes . For nearly two years , an unknown individual or small group has waged a violent campaign to force city officials to roll back an unpopular parking plan , which has placed meters in formerly free zones and sharply raised the cost of parking in the town 's lots . <p> This is no Gandhi-style campaign of civil disobedience . Instead of peaceful protest , long respected in England , someone has been systematically blowing up parking meters , so far hitting about 180 of the machines , which have cost the city more than $1 million to replace . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny . <p> " It 's a threat to public safety , " said police inspector Viv Johnson , who is leading Operation Magee , the task force trying to apprehend the culprit or culprits in a town that boasts it was one of the first settled by the Normans after their 1066 conquest . " When they explode , bits of plastic shrapnel travel at tremendous speed . I 'm very grateful no one has been hurt . " <p> The task force , named after Carl Magee , the American credited with inventing the parking meter concept , is trying a number of tactics . The police are offering a reward . They 're using plainclothes patrols and have conducted some " stop and search " campaigns to find people carrying explosives . <p> The authorities are encouraging citizens to come forward with information . They emphasize that the crimes are costing the town substantial amounts of money . <p> " This is not a case of a Robin Hood who is taking money from a faceless corporation , " said Johnson , who warns that the attacks have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Every machine costs $6,000 to replace , and it 's the taxpayers who have to buy new ones . " <p> Explosives experts <p> Johnson and others believe the culprits have expertise in explosives because of Lewes ' status as a " bonfire town , " where huge bonfires are built each November on Guy Fawkes Night when England celebrates the foiling of a 1605 plot to blow up parliament . <p> At that time of year , residents set off high-powered fireworks . Many detonate " rook scarers , " which are something like firecrackers , but are more powerful , and are usually fired to frighten crows away from crops . Johnson believes the perpetrators are using " rook scarers " - which are sold openly in strips of 10 - to blow up the parking meters . <p> " Most of the people in Lewes know what they 're doing with explosives because of the history of bonfire , " she said . " The attacks tend to pick up in November , when people have a lot of rook scarers . " <p> Public sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but most people concede there is also an ample reservoir of anger about the new parking plan , which limits the amount of time people can spend shopping , eating and visiting in Lewes , a market town of about 16,500 residents some 60 miles south of London . <p> " People are angry about the parking scheme and the way it was brought in , " said David Quinn , the Chamber of Commerce president who has a rug store in the center of Lewes . " It keeps people from coming to town , and when you do come you 're looking at your watch all the time to keep track of the parking . " <p> He said a number of businessmen who have been hurt by the decrease in shoppers are trying to persuade the City Council to soften the new parking regulations . <p> " A lot of people are beginning to realize it 's not the right parking plan , but it 's hard to change it , " he said . <p> Keeps traffic flowing <p> But James Holland , spokesman for the East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new parking system . No alterations are planned , he said . <p> " I would say it 's been successful , " he said . " On the whole , it has kept traffic flowing . " <p> The parking scheme is administered by a private company called NCP , whose blue-clad representatives are known to townspeople as " Blue Meanies . " <p> The company 's office in the town center is decorated with posters warning that the exploding meters pose a danger to the public . <p> Most people in Lewes seem to want the clandestine anti-parking brigade to lay down its explosives , but some do back the campaign . <p> Leah Georges , 20 , said some residents are so upset by the new parking plan and its negative impact on businesses in Lewes that they are " quietly pleased " with the campaign against the parking meters . <p> " As long as they 're not hurting anyone , people do n't mind what they 're doing , " she said . <p> Others are adamantly opposed to the bombers ' tactics . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilkington , 26 . " And actually I 'm quite surprised because this is normally such a quiet place . " <p> Parking is topic No. 1 in the " Letters to the Editor " page of the local newspaper . Most writers condemn not only the vandals but the new parking rules , also . <p> Searching for clues <p> Police forensic teams have moved in after recent explosions to comb the sites for any DNA evidence or other clues . Officials are also studying ways to make parking meters that would be less dangerous if they are exploded . <p> The volunteer group Crime Stoppers has also become involved and is encouraging people to come forward anonymously so they can turn in the perpetrators without fearing retribution , said David Simmons , a retired policeman coordinating the program . <p> He said the reward can be given in secret to protect the identity of the source . <p> " I never saw anything like this in 30 years on the police , " said Simmons . " Whoever it is , is not being deterred by the thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public safety . Either they do n't understand people can be seriously hurt or they do n't care . We need to take them out of the equation . " ## Find Documents with Similar Topics Below are concepts discussed in this document .
