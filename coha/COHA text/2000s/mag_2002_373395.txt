Imagine dining at a restaurant where there are just two dishes on the menu  --  and because one is being eaten by 90% of your fellow diners , the waiter advises you to order that . That was the choice facing computer consumers throughout the 1990s . You could select from a few relatively pricey Apple computers that ran Mac OS on the one hand , and a horde of cookie-cutter Windows-based PCs on the other . A third operating system , Linux , has been available for free since Linus Torvalds created it in 1991 , but for years it was too complex to make it into the mainstream . For most users , Linux was like having to go back into the kitchen and cook a gourmet meal from scratch . <P> Finally , that is starting to change . Linux is still the preserve of geeks , many of whom showed up last week at LinuxWorld in San Francisco . But some of those geeks have realized there 's money to be made from selling user-friendly versions of this powerful and supremely stable software to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wal-Mart 's website is selling $299 PCs that run on an operating system called Lindows ( Microsoft is suing over the name ) , while another Linux brand called Lycoris Desktop LX is about to hit the shelves at CompUSA . The ubiquitous Linux logo , a penguin , is already a hit at places like IBM and much of the U.S. government . Should the rest of us tune him in too ? <P> The best bet right now is Lycoris Desktop/LX , which costs a mere $29 . Lycoris has done an excellent job of hiding all the scary jargon usually associated with Linux , and its desktop looks like Windows ' identical twin . This is pretty amazing , given that it was created by five guys with no funding working around the corner from Microsoft in Redmond , Wash . Yet most basic needs are met right out of the box : programs compatible with Microsoft Office , Outlook , AOL Instant Messenger , Adobe Photoshop  --  and , of course , Tetris . <P> Lycoris is an ideal Windows alternative for anyone buying a PC for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windows and want to switch , it 's a little harder . To save all your old files , you have to create a partition on your hard drive , which is just as difficult as it sounds
