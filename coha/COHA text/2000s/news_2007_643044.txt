<p> In 1936 , two of the Soviet Union 's greatest artists decided to work on a new theatrical production of Pushkin 's " Boris Godunov " for its author 's coming jubilee . Sergei Prokofiev wrote 24 musical pieces while the visionary stage director Vsevolod Meyerhold mapped out scenes and started rehearsals . The following year , Stalin 's terror fixed its gaze on Meyerhold and he abandoned the project . Three years later , he was dead , shot by a firing squad . <p> Now , thanks to the recent discovery of Meyerhold 's original notes and Prokofiev 's handwritten score and comments , their collaboration is finally having its world premiere on Thursday night at the Berlind Theater at Princeton University , 70 years after its planned opening . <p> This mammoth undertaking by Princeton , in conjunction with the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art in Moscow , rescues a production that artists and scholars thought was lost forever . The four sold-out performances will also introduce Meyerhold , a seminal theatrical thinker , to an audience largely ignorant of his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be stunned , " said Simon Morrison , an associate professor of music at Princeton , who excavated Meyerhold 's notes in 2005 from a sealed section of the Russian archive , to which he managed to gain access . Mr. Morrison , who is writing a book about Prokofiev , said : " This is one of the scores that he composed in the ' 30s when he was at the top of his game , and it went to waste . He never heard it in his lifetime . " <p> " Boris " ran afoul of the government long before Prokofiev and Meyerhold got a hold of it . Pushkin 's play  --  about the 16th-century tyrannical czar Boris Godunov , and Dimitri , a pretender to the throne  --  " is very seditious , " said Caryl Emerson , chairwoman of Princeton 's Slavic languages and literature department , who is overseeing the project with Mr. Morrison . <p> This production , which is using a new English translation by Antony Wood , is the first in which all 25 scenes that Pushkin wrote are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three geniuses of Russian culture , " she said . " Pushkin , Prokofiev and Meyerhold , the poet , the composer and the stage director . " <p> Modest Mussorgsky used Pushkin 's play as a source for his fabulously successful opera " Boris Godunov . " But Prokofiev and Meyerhold were contemptuous of what they considered that work 's thick , syrupy , optimistic and romantic score . Meyerhold , for example , envisioned the final scene with a choral sound for the crowd that was " dark , agitated , menacing , like the roar of the sea . " He wrote , " One should feel a gathering of forces , the restraining of an internal rage . " Mussorgsky 's was a 19th-century sound , Mr. Morrison said , " Prokofiev was the first to get at the 20th-century sound . " <p> Meyerhold gave Prokofiev detailed instructions about the kind of orchestral and choral music he wanted and which scenes it would go in . Those notes , along with Prokofiev 's manuscript , descriptions of the work in various memoirs and Meyerhold 's rehearsal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original creation based on some of his ideas , " Tim Vasen , the production 's director , said , referring to Meyerhold . " It 's an amazing collaboration with someone who 's not in the room . " <p> Since Meyerhold often worked with architects , Mr. Morrison asked Princeton 's Architecture School to design the set . Graduate students came up with rows of floor-to-ceiling bungee cords made out of stretchy surgical tubing ( 3,750 feet in all ) set along grooves that run across the stage . The cords can be arranged to suggest trees in a forest , pulled and snapped like bows and arrows during a battle scene or wrapped around a character 's body to evoke emotions like anger or frustration . The set is remarkably flexible , though it did prevent the choreographer , Rebecca Lazier , from using pointe steps , because the dancers ' toe shoes kept getting stuck in the grooves . <p> For a scene set at a Polish ball , Meyerhold wrote that he wanted a " full orchestra in a social setting performing three numbers , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' " which Prokofiev composed . Mr. Vasen has placed some of the musicians and the conductor , Michael Pratt , onstage . Wearing 18th-century-style wigs that look like neon-colored cotton candy , the musicians are stacked on levels behind a giant red window frame , like an extended " Hollywood Squares " set . <p> Although he originally worked with Stanislavski , Meyerhold came to disdain the naturalistic method of acting , preferring much more stylized , physical movement that he developed into a system called Biomechanics . He drew on a wide range of influences , from Kabuki to Frederick Taylor 's time-motion studies , to create theater that would dissolve the wall between actor and audience . <p> An enthusiastic revolutionary , Meyerhold initially found his " people 's theater " embraced by the Bolsheviks . But by the 1930s , Socialist Realism had become the approved revolutionary aesthetic , and Meyerhold 's avant-garde , cinematic style was considered subversive . <p> Mr. Vasen , with advice from Mr. Morrison and Ms. Emerson , has incorporated these ideas into the play . Marina , the Polish princess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms at her sides , wrists bent at 90-degree angles like a mannequin while her suitor professes his undying love . To accompany her command to " Reveal your heart to me , " Prokofiev wrote an " Amoroso " that was inspired by the cheap , trashy soundtracks of 1930s Hollywood melodramas . <p> During the battle scenes , Mr. Vasen uses one of Meyerhold 's physical warm-up exercises  --  a rhythmic , mechanized toe-to-heel step  --  for the soldiers ' march . Prokofiev composed what Mr. Morrison calls a " musical cartoon , " using carnival rhythms and the fife and drum . During Sunday night 's rehearsal , the line of soldiers , wearing helmets like the Tin Man 's in " The Wizard of Oz , " clumped toward the edge of the stage , and then pivoted . One went a couple of inches too far and accidentally fell off the stage before quickly scrambling back up . After the scene , Mr. Morrison shouted up to a few musicians perched on a balcony to slow down the tempo . <p> Harlow Robinson , who wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University in Boston , said of the Princeton production that it was " certainly significant to be hearing and seeing it all together . " The original aborted production " promised to be very brilliant . " <p> A Russian television crew from the state-run Channel 1 was scheduled to film Tuesday night 's dress rehearsal and explain to viewers how it is that this essentially Russian work is being first performed in New Jersey . In Russia , Pushkin is more often read than performed , particularly since the fall of the Soviet Union , which ended state subsidies and introduced artistic freedom . <p> From Mr. Morrison and Ms. Emerson 's perspective , only a university with resources like Princeton 's could afford such an undertaking . The 15 actors ( who play 70 parts ) , 10 dancers , 24 choral singers and 35 musicians are all undergraduates . " The entire campus became a kind of creative workshop , an atelier , " Mr. Morrison said . <p> Many are taking part in the play as part of an academic course . On Thursday , a three-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an exhibition of materials from the period at the Firestone Library on campus here . Putting on the four performances is costing an estimated $140,000 , Mr. Morrison said . The performances are sold out , but he said there was a chance some seats would become available before curtain time . There are also free tickets to Wednesday night 's dress rehearsal that may become available 20 minutes before the 8 p.m. start . <p> For Mr. Morrison , " one of the great tragedies of musical history is what happened to Prokofiev 's art . " Only half of what Prokofiev composed is known ; the rest was unpublished , altered or lost , he said . Though Prokofiev 's music for " Boris " has been recorded , Mr. Morrison said , " the music does n't make sense without the words . " Now , after seeing this production , he said he felt as if the " words do n't make sense without the music . " ##
