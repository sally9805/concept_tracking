ASPEN SPOTTED THE MARK and sent Little Gil scrambling through the crowd of suits and smartcars to fetch Rachel . From her perch in the rafters of the abandoned warehouse , Rachel listened to the boy , her good eye bright , her bad eye in the ruined side of her face as dead as a fish gone belly up , then she called Max over . <p> " Watch the family , " Rachel said . " There 's slavers about . " As if hiding them from sight , Max maneuvered his bulk before the younger children - cherub-faced Roy Boyd , Rough Neck , Julie , Cinnamon and the others . Max was slow , but he was as old as Rachel , stubble already dotting his chin and his voice turning to gravel . " Maybe we 'll eat this week , " Rachel said and let Little Gil lead her away . <p> They raced the alleys past Rush Street and Fifth , dodging rollie pollies and feral dogs until they found Aspen perched on the cement wall in Heart Plaza . Aspen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger into the noonday crowd . <p> Rachel searched the crowd of suits until she focused on the gray-haired man and his elegant lady lounging by the fountain . " Why him ? " she asked . <p> Aspen shrugged her shoulders . " Trailed him from the highbank . Saw him pat his pockets all the time . Big big bulge there . " <p> " Need a dodge ? " Little Gil asked . <p> Rachel shook her head . Too dangerous in broad daylight to risk the little boy . She checked for rollie pollies or robot cars , but saw only suits and a rainbow arcing through the fountain spray . Rachel sized up the situation , blocking out anything irrelevant to her goal , then scrambled toward the mark . People , when they noticed the girl at all , made way for her as if stepping around dog shit . Mostly , they tried to avoid looking at her ruined face /left side of her face like melted wax , eye hanging low on the cheek , the stuff of nightmare vide/ . Rachel ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been stared at and avoided . None of that mattered anymore . The kids needed money . These people had the money . Nothing else in life mattered . <p> Rachel eased behind the gray-haired man , slipped on her pathetic look and tugged at the man 's arm . He flinched at the touch and turned . His eyes narrowed and his mouth formed an O. <p> " Please , sir , " Rachel said . " You dropped this . " She opened her hand to display a tiny data chip resting on her palm . Instinctively , the man 's hand moved to his left suit pocket . <p> " Why , I do n't know , " he said . <p> The woman looked down at Rachel , her initial shock yielding into pity . The man reached into his pocket and extracted a handful of data chips . " I do n't know , " he said . " I thought I only had five . " <p> Rachel shrugged her shoulders . " I saw it fall right there by your pants leg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> She turned to leave , felt the pressure of a hand on her shoulder . She had him . She turned to make sure she owned the woman . " You 're very pretty , " she said . <p> The woman smiled . " What 's your name ? " she asked . <p> " Rachel . " <p> " It 's a lovely name , " she said . <p> " At least my name 's lovely , " Rachel said . <p> Heartbreak flared on the woman 's face . <p> " Let me see that chip , " the man said , replacing his own chips in his pocket . <p> Rachel handed him the chip , turning to his side as she did so , her thin hand , as light as cotton candy , slipped into his pocket and retrieved a chip . <p> " No , no , I do n't think this is mine , " the man said handing it back to Rachel . " But thank you very much , young lady . " <p> Rachel smiled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared behind them in flak jacket and mirrored shades . Play innocent ? If only she could see the cop 's eyes . His hand slid down his side where a holster should be . Instinct took over and Rachel fled . <p> She made it three yards , trying to put suits between her and the rollie pollie . She never heard the stunner . Her legs buckled , her back arched , electric fire singed her nerves . Rachel collapsed and writhed like a marionette jerked about by a mad puppeteer , then lay still , consciousness fleeing down a bright white tunnel . <p> AWARENESS RETURNED with a dull throb in Rachel 's head and an ache in her knees . She opened her eyes to see a bug with way too many legs scurry across the concrete floor . For a moment , the bug looked as if it might head for her face , then thought better of it and dashed into a hole in the wall . The smell of urine infected the air and someone had vomited in a corner , days ago from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a fetal position to sit up and massage the ache from her knees . A security camera on the ceiling hissed on its mount , tracking her moves . She watched it , wondering if she could maneuver behind it and pop it from its mount . Government-issue electronics fetched a good price on the streets . <p> Heels clicked on linoleum . Rachel had landed in the tombs before and knew the drill . She slapped on her pathetic mask complete with a tear and a stifled sob . The cell door clanked open to reveal a uniform with a face as pockmarked as the concrete floor . He regarded Rachel for a moment , then spit . <p> " Let 's go , kid , " he said . <p> The uniform pushed her through a corridor as stark and white as a fainting spell . ' %nock off the act , " the uniform said . " No one believes you . " <p> Rachel sniffled and wiped her nose on her sleeve . " What 's going to happen to me ? " she whined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shut up , " the uniform said . <p> Rachel resisted an urge to bite his leg . A stunner flapped in its holster at his side , within reach and as tempting as the mark in the plaza . She wanted the weapon , not because Rachel had any thoughts of escape , but simply because it was available . Rachel was a thief , the best in the city , and good enough to keep the other kids in food and clothes , the young ones even looking up to her as if she was some vid star . Sometimes it seemed as if years ago the idea of stealing entered her mind then got stuck there , repeating itself endlessly until it crowded out all other thoughts , in effect stealing her own brain . So she eyed the stunner , even began to lift her hand toward it , but caught herself in time . <p> They passed a group of rollie pollies slipping on their flak jackets and heading for a tour of duty , followed another corridor and entered a bare white interrogation room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cop , but instead found the gray-haired mark and his woman . The uniform kicked the door shut and leaned against the wall . <p> " Behave yourself , " he said and pushed Rachel toward the couple . <p> " Come here , " the woman said . " No one is going to hurt you . " <p> Rachel approached slowly , keeping her eyes on her boots . When she stood before the couple , the woman took Rachel 's chin in her hand and tilted her head back so she could see the girl 's face . The woman had the plastic look of someone who had been through many rejuvenation treatments . The man looked more natural , jowls beginning to sag his face , sad eyes lost in deep sockets . <p> " Whatever were you going to do with my credit chips ? " the man asked . <p> Rachel shrugged her shoulders . " I was hungry , " she said between sniffles . " Maybe I could sell it or something . " <p> The uniform laughed . " Do n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a ring . The smart ones can hack your account before you even know a chip is missing . " <p> Rachel tucked her chin into her collarbone , began to bury her face in the woman 's skirt , but hesitated for effect . " Go right ahead , " the woman said and hugged Rachel close to her . <p> The man knelt beside her and said , " What happened to your face ? " <p> Her voice muffled by the skirt , Rachel said , " Always been that way . " <p> " Your parents ca n't afford skin replacement ? " he asked . <p> Rachel said nothing , at first for effect , but as she inhaled the woman 's mingled perfume and sweat , something caught in her throat . At her silence , the woman sighed and stroked Rachel 's hair . " Do you live on the street ? " she asked . Rachel nodded her head . <p> The man said , " Officer , my wife and I do not wish to press charges . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts will just let her lose again , anyways . " <p> Rachel pulled away from the woman , amazed at her good fortune , and forced a grin onto her tear-streaked face . <p> The woman said , " Would you like to come home with us ? For a little while at least ? We may be able to find a place for you . " <p> Real fear sent Rachel several paces away from them . They did n't look like slavers , but you never could tell . When she found Little Gil in an alley , the boy had just escaped from two years as a sex toy . <p> " We wo n't hurt you , honestly , " the woman said . <p> The man said , " It 's not your fault - what you 've become . Maybe it 's time my family gave something back to the world . " <p> Which made as much sense as a burp to Rachel , but her instincts seldom failed her and she guessed the couple were sincere . <p> " Thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the butt . <p> MR . AND MRS . ARMSTRONG lived in one of the new developments on Carriage Hill . The house greeted them as they entered and Mozart piped through ceiling speakers . Rachel swore the walls were beige when she entered , but within seconds they transformed into a cheerful yellow . <p> " See , " Mrs. Armstrong said . " House is glad you 've come to stay with us . " <p> Rachel gaped at the grand stairway , the hutch filled with crystal glimpsed in the dining room , enough furniture to sleep twice as many kids as lived in the warehouse . The house seemed to go on forever , square rooms and circular rooms and skylights and even a greenhouse that smelled of lilacs and wet earth . <p> The Armstrongs introduced Rachel to their son Bobby . Bobby was home from Dartmouth on spring break . To Rachel , he looked like one of those golden men in underwear ads . Bobby stared blankly at Rachel , then grinned and said , " How 's it going , shitface ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rachel said , " Fine , cocksucker . " <p> " Rachel ! " Mrs. Armstrong cried . <p> Bobby Armstrong threw his head back and laughed . " This is going to be great , " he said . <p> " There is some language we use and some we do n't , " Mrs. Armstrong said . Distaste soured her face , then vanished in a sad smile . " What you must have lived through . Poor little girl . " <p> Bobby said , " You want to give it a bath ? " <p> His mother shot him a curdled-milk look . <p> Bobby knelt beside Rachel and examined her face . When his fingers brushed her skin they stoked a deep warmth in her belly as if he strummed music on her skin . She tried to look him in the eye , but focused on his belt buckle . " Street kid , right ? " he asked . <p> Rachel nodded . <p> " Ever been to a VR alley ? " he asked . " Ever play Sim Psycho ? " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when she looked into his face she saw only curiosity . She shook her head . " I 'll take you next time I go with the guys . Would you like that ? " <p> " Yes , please , " Rachel said . Bobby stood and grinned and as he walked away , Rachel gaped at the curve of his butt beneath his jeans and felt heat enflame her ruined face . <p> That night , the house bathed Rachel in warm water and bubbles and added a skin conditioner . Mrs. Armstrong gave her a nightgown decorated with happy turtles , left over from her daughter Claire . Claire was attending CalTech , Mrs. Armstrong explained , finishing her post-doc work in oceanography . Bobby excelled in math and even though he was only a freshman he already knew his field was economic modeling , something to do with artificial intelligence and stocks , which was all beyond her . " They 're wonderful kids , " she sighed . <p> By three in the morning , Rachel carted a pillow case full of silverware , palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . She paused in the hallway by the Armstrong 's bedroom , listened , then eased the door open . Rabbit soft she crept to the dresser and opened a jewelry box and quietly sucked in her breath . She had never touched actual diamonds . Bracelets and pendants and earrings were arranged on velvet as if resting in a jeweler 's display case . Rachel helped herself , slipped from the bedroom and headed downstairs . With a hand on the door , she hesitated , trying to figure out the alarm system . <p> " Can I help ? " the house asked . <p> " Go to sleep , " Rachel hissed , then said , " Turn off the alarm . " <p> " I 'm sorry . That command can not be overwritten . " <p> Rachel ignored the metallic voice and crept to the living room window . A full moon plated the neighborhood in silver . It was all so quiet , so still , far different from the insane background hum of sirens and traffic in the city . She thought she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Headlights suddenly knifed through the dark , sending Rachel a step back into the shadows . Two smart cars hummed up the driveway ; even before the engines cut , she heard the laughter . Bobby Armstrong staggered from a sleek black car , tottered for a moment , then made way for a girl with golden hair . Two other boys leaped from the second car , laughing , using a beer can for a football . Oblivious to their friends , Bobby and the girl embraced , leaned against the car until he supported her weight and she scissored her legs around his waist . In the moonlight they looked like enchanted lovers from a fairy tale . <p> Rachel smirked as she watched ; these happy dolts would last all of one day on the streets . Her smirk died , smothered in a sudden , immense longing , the memory of Bobby Armstrong 's fingers on her face igniting within her like heat lightning . There were what - five or six years between them ? The thought made no difference to Rachel ; she wanted him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands stroke the girl 's thighs , her own hands finding their way between her legs . <p> The beer can ricocheted off the car hood . Laughing , Bobby and the girl parted . Rachel dropped behind a couch as Bobby sauntered into the house . From across the room she could smell the beer and hemp . She watched him mount the stairs , heard the cars drive off , laughter trailing behind like exhaust . As she hid , Rachel began to rethink her plan . Actually she had no plan , just the never-ending urge to steal . But slowly , a new thought crept into her mind , a vague plan . Maybe this was too good to blow with a quick strike . If she stayed a while and played good girl , who knew what real riches she might find ? She sat on the proverbial gold mine , enough to keep the kids in high style , maybe enough to break the grind of hunting money and food , for a while at least . <p> Or maybe she just wanted to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind . Dumb bitch . Only the family mattered . Besides , who could want her with a face from a nightmare ? <p> Still , the plan made sense . With a struggle , Rachel replaced most of her loot , except for a shiny diamond pendant thing . She found a phone and dialed Aspen 's current stolen cell phone number . The girl appeared blearyeyed in the viewer , then gaped . " Where are you ? Are you all right ? " <p> " Better than ever , my missy missy . " Rachel said . She explained her situation and her plan . " Give mea few days and we 'll clean this place out . " <p> Aspen looked unconvinced . " Maybe we can get by for a few days without you , " she said . <p> " You be boss lady , " Rachel said . " How 's Little Gil ? " <p> " Miserable , " Aspen said . " He 's so afraid the rollie pollies will hack your brain . " <p> " Tell him not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bringing him milk and honey . Hug him for me . And tell Max to stand guard . Never know what slime is roaming the streets . " <p> Aspen 's face went grim . " Max is feeling mighty low right now . You told him to protect us and - know it now , I guess . Roy Boyd snuck out . He ai n't come back . " <p> Rachel 's gut turned hollow . How old was Roy Boyd - nine maybe with blond locks and cherub face . Good pickings for slavers , the kind of boy they could sell real easy to grimy rich guys . <p> " Everybody 's real nervous , " Aspen said . " They 're afraid of what will happen if you do n't come back . Where 's the eats coming from . Where 's .... " <p> " You tell them about the plan , " Rachel snapped . " You tell them to stay put . I never let any of you down before . Right ? You tell them to remember that . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get hurt . " <p> " Sleep tight , missy missy , " Rachel said . She cut the connection and crept upstairs to her bed beneath a canopy of silk , but sleep eluded her . She remembered playing five card stud with Roy Boyd and his grin exploding across his face like fireworks . Come home , Roy Boyd , please . But she did not expect to see the boy again . Too many others had strayed and been swallowed up by the streets . Rachel rarely thought about the future ; surviving the present took all her heart . But the past wrote itself into her brain like lessons carved into granite . Good-bye , Roy Boyd . <p> IN THE MORNING , Rachel ate scrambled eggs and waffles and scones . Mrs. Armstrong watched her , smiling all the while as if she had just told the most wonderful story . The dining nook overlooked a small patio and a path leading to a stream and a pine forest beyond . Cardinals pecked at seeds stuck in a honey cone and squirrels played tag in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roses and remembered the time she was so hungry she ate a butterfly . That was long ago , before she learned her trade , when some nights the kids battled feral dogs in the alleys over scraps of garbage . <p> After breakfast , Mr. Armstrong took Rachel by the hand and led her to a gazebo overlooking the stream . Bobby appeared at the side of the house and drove away in a two-seater . Rachel wondered what he would look like in his underwear , remembered how his hands stroked the girl 's thighs . <p> " He 's a good kid , " Mr. Armstrong said , catching her gaze at his son . " Both our children are . They have good futures . We made sure of that . " Mr. Armstrong sighed and leaned back on his bench . Rachel swung on a swing chair and dangled her new shoes above the red wood . " I do n't envy them the world they have to live in , " Mr. Armstrong said . " It 's crazy , just crazy . Unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no chance to compete . Claire 's a pure gene mod , but by the time Bobby reached high school we had to augment him with a co-processor . Where will it end ? " <p> He closed his eyes for a moment , then opened them and studied Rachel . " That 's why you 're in the state you 're in , " he said . " If you have the money , your kids thrive . If you do n't .... " He held his hands out , palms up as if displaying the answer . " What 's your first memory ? " he asked . <p> The question took Rachel by surprise . She thought about it , finally conjured up an image of Mr. Clancy . " I do n't think he was my father , " she said . " I think he was what they call a foster parent . " <p> " Was he nice ? " Mr. Armstrong asked . <p> " He touched me here , " she answered , dropping her hand to her crotch . " He smelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been kicked . " What happened ? " <p> Rachel shrugged her shoulders . " These kids were boosting vids from a loading dock . I saw them and saw rollie pollies coming and I warned them and ran with them . Guess I 've been with them since then . " <p> Mr. Armstrong shook his head in disbelief . " You kids live on your own ? How do you survive ? " <p> Rachel shrugged her shoulders , not sure how truthful she should be . She settled on , " The older kids bring us food and money . " <p> With a sad nod of his head , Mr. Armstrong said , " I see . It 's just so damned unfair . It 's not your fault your parents were poor . And the thing of it is , there 's no chance for any of you to catch up . How can you compete with a kid engineered to an IQ of 175 ? It 's getting worse every day . You 're damned here on Earth . " <p> Rachel nodded sagely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Well for you , at any rate , that will change a bit . My wife and I have talked this over . We are very well connected . We want to fix your face . " <p> Rachel was sure she had misunderstood him . Fix her ? How ? <p> " Well , say something , " the man said and grinned . <p> Rachel turned away from him , felt her cheeks flush , suddenly unwilling to have anyone see her damaged face . Later , she went to her bedroom and her body , as if taking on a life of its own , took her to the mirror . A gargoyle stared back at her . She had lied to the Armstrongs , although she could n't say why . Clancy had ruined her face , burned it with acid when she tried to fight him off . She examined the scars , touched them , stretched the skin to see what it might look like if the Armstrongs fixed her . Rachel had no memory of a normal face . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , people treated her like a plague carrier and left her alone , pretended she did n't exist . Which was how she learned her trade and survived . Her very ugliness made her invisible . <p> Rachel pictured herself pretty like Aspen . She pictured a boy like Bobby Armstrong looking at her and seeing her and liking what he saw and taking her in his arms , reaching for her thighs . <p> A sudden chill shuddered its way through Rachel . She hugged herself and turned from the mirror . She could not let herself want a life like that . She had her kids to think about . Nothing else mattered . <p> But still ... ? <p> THE OLD NEED sent Rachel on the prowl that night . She fought the impulse to take everything and run , decorate herself with diamonds and stuff her pockets with the cash money she knew must be secreted somewhere in the house . No , have patience , remember the plan . But she had to take something . She found an antique fountain pen in a roll-top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how people paid big money for worthless old junk if you called it an antique . Rachel grabbed the pen and headed upstairs . <p> Outside Bobby Armstrong 's door , Rachel hesitated . The closed door beckoned like the entrance to a cave hiding treasure . Rachel had no idea if Bobby was home , but trusted her stealth . Besides , maybe she 'd get a glimpse of the boy in his underwear , even naked . With a mischievous grin , Rachel eased open the door . <p> The bed across the room was empty . She tiptoed in , froze when she glimpsed a cold blue light in an alcove to her right . She looked , her heart thumped against her ribs . <p> Bobby sprawled in a recliner , his face turned garish in the light of a palm terminal in his hand , shining upward and casting demonic shadows . His eyes were wide open , looked straight at Rachel , but saw nothing in the room . His jaw hung slack and drool flecked his chin . A thin lead stretched from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Channel surfing , Rachel thought . She shuddered and stepped backward . Rachel lived in a world fueled by drugs . No price was too high for the promise of escape . Joy Bang and Delirium and Mex and Supercoke and a new one every week rushed like a river through the streets and more people than she could count got swept up in that torrent , swept to their deaths . Rachel had two rules for her kids - no one squeals and no one goes near drugs . Anyone tempted by the easy money got kicked out on their ass . She made that rule the day the rollie pollies fished Joey Barnes from the river , a wad of bills in one pocket , a syringe in the other . Joey had been eight years old . <p> To Rachel , channel surfing was just another drug . She could barely read , would n't know an icon from a coffee cup , but she understood the principle . Kids like Bobby Armstrong , the ones augmented with coprocessors , could have jacks surgically implanted and from there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their reveries , Rachel could n't guess . But once jacked in , they were hooked no differently than the Joy Bang addict . And like the addict , if a channel surfer lost their fix , they went mad and screamed and tore their own flesh . Only drug addicts recovered . Channel surfers just withdrew into ruined and empty hulks , forever grieving their lost electronic world . <p> Rachel turned away from Bobby Armstrong and hurried to her room . <p> She slept little that night , sitting in her bed beneath the silk canopy , listening to the night sounds - an owl hooting outside , walls settling , pipes creaking . It was so easy to be fooled by the skylights and the clean tablecloths and the Armstrongs ' generosity and Bobby 's good looks and all the while miss the sense of something gone terribly wrong in their lives . In his own way , Bobby ran from his demons just as Rachel 's family ran from the street . The thought , oddly , cheered Rachel . No golden God , Bobby was flawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She imagined herself beautiful and Bobby Armstrong taking her in his arms and giving her presents of his own free will . A yearning for such a life swept through Rachel , a yearning as strong as her need to steal . She could get used to life in a bed like this . With that thought , she finally fell asleep . <p> The next morning , Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong went out.Rachel took the diamond pendant thing and the antique pen and headed into the pines behind the house . The forest was actually a tiny nature preserve leading to a commons . From there , she cut across the development to the rendezvous point , the tube station on Fredricksburg Avenue . Little Gil saw her first , threw himself into her arms . Rachel swung him around , then hugged Aspen . <p> " Hey , missy missy . " <p> " Hey you , " Aspen said . <p> Little Gil yanked her arm . " Come home , " he pleaded . <p> " Not now , " she said . " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aspen cocked her head and frowned . " You sure you knows the score ? " <p> " Did I ever fuck up ? " <p> " Never , " said Aspen . <p> " No way , " said Little Gil . <p> Rachel glanced over her shoulder , waited for a suit to pass , then stuffed the pendant and the pen into Aspen 's hand . The girl 's eyes formed discs . " We 've never never never had this much ! " <p> " And there 's more . I 've got to get back . Take this to Greasy Jack and do n't let him sucker you . But first show this stuff to the family . Make them understand there 's more where this came from . Take care missy missy . " <p> She pulled away from Little Gil and was about to leave , but instead asked , " Roy Boyd ? " <p> " Gone , " Aspen said . <p> Rachel forced back a shudder and turned to race toward the development . She heard Little Gil cry out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill ' em . Eat their eyeballs for dinner ! " <p> " No worry , no pain , " Rachel called to them . <p> When she forded the stream and started up the incline to the house , she spied Bobby sitting on the patio , grinning at her . " Good morning , shitface , " he said . <p> " Morning , cocksucker , " she said . <p> " Sit and have a beer with me . " <p> " Sure , " she said , and accepted a frosted stein . Bobby watched her over the rim of his stein , his gaze flooding her body with warmth . <p> " You were in my room last night , " he said . <p> Rachel flinched , then willed herself impassive , judged the distance to the drive and escape . <p> " No point in lying , " he said . " House told me . House watches everything you do . " <p> She sat motionless , but defeat slumped her soul . No new face , no milk and honey , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . I programmed House to watch you . My poor parents . They mean well . They would n't snoop on you . Probably think it would n't be good for your self-esteem or something . " He swallowed a gulp and leaned forward . " So I guess we have a little stalemate here . Let 's make a deal . " <p> " What kind of deal ? " Rachel asked . <p> " You keep your mouth shut and I keep my mouth shut . We both win . Deal ? " <p> " Deal , " she said , still planning her escape . <p> Bobby leaned back and took a drink , wiped foam from his lips with his tongue . <p> " Is it better than Joy Bang ? " she asked . <p> He smirked and shook his head . " You are the little bitch , are n't you ? There 's no comparison . None at all . " <p> " What do you do when you 're hooked up ? " She craned her neck to see if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any trace . <p> " Listen , " he said . Bobby 's eyes focused on something far beyond Rachel .

When you 're jacked , you 're part of it . It floats you away and all this - this shit we call life does n't matter anymore . You do n't matter because you 're part of it . " <p> " Sounds like Joy Bang , " she said . <p> Bobby focused on her and smiled . " Maybe it is . But that 's not why we do it . Afterward , you know things . " <p> She waited for him to continue , but he just went on smiling . " What kind of things ? " she asked . <p> " Things , " he said . " All kinds .

But our minds take it all in . Same way on the Net . Maybe the rush is like Joy Bang , but underneath it all , the wealth of the Net is zooming straight into our subconscious .

" <p> She watched him leave in his sports car , feeling stunned and confused and then terrified . <p> At first she had no idea what demons drove her , but they forced her into the house .

And then who would lead her kids ? <p> Rachel loaded her pockets with rings and bracelets , raided Bobby 's room and found cash money in his desk . She turned to flee , but hesitated . She tasted salt on her lips and with a start realized tears rolled down her cheeks . Rachel slumped in the recliner and let it mold itself to her thin body , embracing her like a plastic hug . By late afternoon , her sobbing ended and in the resulting calm she saw the solution . She would steal a future for them and herself , only her booty could n't be stuffed into her pockets or tied up in a pillow case . It sailed on electric winds in a place she could not touch , but which nonetheless existed and thus could be robbed . It was the same place where she could become one with Bobby . <p> The Armstrongs came home that night to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried in a pillow . She ran to them and hugged Mr. Armstrong and cried into his belt . At last , the two adults calmed her hysteria and sat with her on the couch . Mrs. Armstrong stroked Rachel 's hair and said , " What is it , child ? " <p> " I do n't care about my face , " Rachel blubbered . " I do n't want you to fix it ! " <p> The Armstrongs , puzzled , calmed her again . " Why wo n't you let us help you ? " Mr. Armstrong said . <p> " I listened to what you told me , " Rachel whimpered . " You 're right . It does n't matter what I look like . I ca n't be like you . I 'm just normal . I 'll never be anything ! " <p> " There , there , " Mrs. Armstrong said . She glanced at her husband who did his best to hide his own moist eyes . <p> " Rachel , " he said . " Listen to me . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your genetic makeup . But there are other ways . Augmentations . Remember what I told you about our son ? " <p> Rachel nodded . " The co - co .... " <p> " Co-processor , " Mr. Armstrong said . " Perhaps a modification like that is possible . " <p> Rachel looked up at him and wiped the grime from her face . " I just want to be like you , " she said . " I do n't want to go back to the streets . " <p> Mrs. Armstrong smiled . " That will never happen , child . We can at least save you . " <p> Rachel hugged the woman and rubbed her eyes with her knuckles . She waited up late that night until Bobby , smelling of beer and weed , staggered into the house . He flinched when she stepped in front of him , then rearranged his face into a smirk . " Hey , shitface , " he said . <p> " I 've been caught before . The only bad thing that will happen to me is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get caught they 'll take away that socket and you wo n't have your fix . " <p> Bobby did his best to grin , but his mouth faltered . " What are you talking about ? " <p> " You know what happens when a channel surfer gets cut off . You want to be a zombie ? " <p> " I ought to break your stupid neck , " he snapped and almost lunged for her . <p> " New deal , " she said . " Your parents said they 'd get mea co-processor . I keep my mouth shut if you help me get my own jack . " <p> He gaped at her , suddenly laughed . " Is this a joke ? " <p> Rachel shook her head . <p> " I wo n't be blackmailed by you , " he said . <p> " Yes you will , " she said . <p> He considered her demands , finally sighed and rubbed his eyes . " I 'm going to bed , " he said . <p> " And when I 'm hooked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me sometimes and make love to me . " <p> Bobby froze on the steps , kept his back to her , then without a word climbed to his bedroom . <p> Rachel sat on the couch before her rubbery legs gave out . Terror shuddered its way through her thin body , terror at her plan , fear of some terrible retribution . Mostly she trembled at the thought of what she was about to become , everything she would lose . <p> Ah , but everything she 'd gain ! <p> WHEN SHE WAS ready , Rachel left the Armstrongs , house , carrying a sack of loot . She took the tube into the city and entered the warehouse . <p> Little Gil spotted her first , swung from his perch in the pipes and ran to her and threw himself into her arms . Max and Cinnamon and Rough Neck followed , and Aspen hugged her best friend as if afraid to let her go and risk losing Rachel again . <p> " Hey , missy , missy , " Rachel said . <p> " Hey you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids gathered around her in the warehouse and there on a dais made from old pallets , Rachel sat in a high-backed wooden chair , wearing one of Mrs. Armstrong 's diamond necklaces . Little Gil and Aspen decorated her hair with dandelions and lilies . For a moment , Rachel fingered the palm terminal . She still had time to back out . <p> Instead , she said , " This will take some time . I have to learn how to use it . But soon we will have all the milk and honey anybody could ever want . " <p> Rachel inserted the lead into the jack at the base of her skull . At first there was nothing . Then , slowly , the voices formed out of random static , thousands of them , a symphony of lives all connected in one massive song . Rachel closed her eyes and let her mind join the son &; the music of her future . Like Bobby , she would soon know things , the patterns to lead her kids from the streets . And she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , lovers entwined on an electric bed . <p> IMG
