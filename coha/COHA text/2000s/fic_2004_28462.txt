Chapter One Trapani , Sicily , 1853 " Look at him , Patrizia , " one woman commented to her neighbor over coffee , pointing at the object of her disgust : a young man sauntering down the cobbled road with a group of his friends . " He walks - no , he swaggers . Like one who knows he will have all the girls clamoring for his attention tonight . He thinks he is the most handsome , charming young man in all of Sicily . " " Well , perhaps he has reason , Anna . " Patrizia smiled with indulgent patience , watching the man-child strutting down the road as if he were a conquering emperor . " He looks like a statue of Apollo I saw once in Rome , when I was a girl . Those Capriati boys are too handsome and charming for their own good ! I remember his father at that age ... ah , for Vincenzo , my heart would flutter ... " " Yes , " Anna muttered , her voice dark , " Enzo was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all alike , these Capriatis . But one day , their arrogance and their careless ways with the local girls will come back to haunt them , mark my words . " A shadow crossed the sun at that moment , though no clouds littered the afternoon sky . " Alleluia , " both women muttered with a shudder , crossing themselves . " Giovanni Capriati ! " The strident cry rang across the street clear to the public square at one end , which was filled with flowers and bright-colored banners for tonight 's May Day dance for the young people . " Giovanni Capriati ! " The women gasped . That fiery voice could not be mistaken - it was Sophia Morelli , the local witch . Her heart 's treasure , her silly , pretty teenage daughter Giulia stood half-crouched behind her , sobbing . So Anna 's prophecy was having an immediate fulfillment ... and this time , not only Anna and Patrizia crossed themselves . Yet the Capriati boy did not so much as turn his head , but he continued strutting down the road , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will stop ! You will listen to me ! " With the little , careless shrug that only a Capriati could accomplish the boy turned , his dark , **32;294;TOOLONG face bored . " Yes , Signorina Morelli ? May I assist you ? " " You broke my daughter 's heart ! " the famed wisewoman cried , her face scorched with the heat of livid fury . " Do you deny you met her in secret , kissed her , promised her your love and then moved on to the next girl ? " " I only kissed her ! What 's the harm in that ? I promised Giulia nothing , woman , " Giovanni retorted , his head high , eyes bland . " I have never done so with any girl . I am not an idiot , to make promises to a witch 's get , " he muttered to his friends . The boys laughed , nudging each other . " I heard that , ragazzo ! " Sophia 's voice rang to the rafters of each house . Within moments the windows filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing up to Sophia , who knew herb lore and was rumored to have poisoned her first husband when he was unfaithful . " Now , you will pay for crossing me ! " A teary whimper came from behind her . " No , Mama , no ... do not kill him ! Do not hurt him ! Think what you do ! " Sophia 's face , still holding a haughty loveliness at fifty , smiled at her distraught daughter . " I think of you , and the boy 's papa who broke my sister 's heart . The arrogant Capriati men need a lesson ... " Her eyes flashed with magnificent fury as she threw down a little sack of herbs and flowers at the boy 's feet . " Listen , people of Trapani ! You are my witnesses . I curse the Capriati men ! From this day they will fall in love with women who are their complete opposites and would have nothing to do with them . For all their charm , they will discover what it is to fight for love ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have met their Fate until it is too late .... " Giovanni looked around at his squirming friends with a careless grin . " This is a curse ? Woman , you 're losing your touch . I thought you capable of better . As if any girl would refuse me ! " Sophia smiled and turned her daughter away from the boy the girl still adored . " You will see , arrogant bambino , " she chuckled softly . " Arrivederci to your heart , young fool . You will see . " Michelson Laboratories , Sydney , the present time If it were n't for the monkeys , she 'd never have dreamed of doing it . But there they were as usual , loud and smelly , spoiled and loved . The collective set of final straws that broke her own particular camel 's back , and changed her life . Leaning in the doorway of the laboratory , Abigail Lucinda Miles felt the usual rush of frustrated sorrow . Of course he was still in his crumpled lab coat , leaning over his cage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her fiance started , spilling his eyedropper onto the petri dish . He turned to her , his tanned , handsome face and brilliant blue eyes cool with displeasure . " You do remember that this experiment is vital , and every vial of scent costs hundreds of dollars ? " She sighed , digging her hands into her pockets . " Yes , I know , Hugh , but we 're meeting our parents in an hour at Bringelly 's to discuss the wedding ... " He added another cautious drop to the clear dish , his blond hair glinting in the light , like a Nordic god . " What - ? " Then he sighed . " Oh , yes . I forgot . Can you hold them off an hour or two ? " " I do n't think they 'll mind , " she replied , but could n't hold in the weary smile . The chimps jumped up and down in their series of connected cages , screaming , cackling . He swiveled back to his simian friends , his eyes on fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " But seeing no sign of his long-expected reaction , he sighed . " It 's just another few months , then we can do other things . " He grabbed her shoulders , his eyes blazing . " Abigail , we 're so close . With one breakthrough we 'd get the corporate funding we need , and I could move on to - " " Getting married ? " she asked , in wistful hope . " Have I been neglecting you again ? " He kissed her nose . " I thought you understood why I 've had to concentrate on this the past few months . Sorry , baby . I 'll take Saturday off and devote the day to our wedding . " " Really ? " Her eyes lit up . " I 'll show you my dress . It 's white tulle , with a lovely tiara - and I found a great florist - " " No wonder you 're feisty today . " His hands fell on her shoulders , breaking into her dreamworld with tender impatience . " Honestly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Jekyll and Hyde . You 're on that Lucy kick again . " Sizzling color raced up her cheeks . " Well , it is my name - well , my middle name . Abigail Lucinda Miles . " She would not give in to the sneaking shame she felt every time her parents or Hugh chided her about her " Lucy kick " - she would n't ! ( Continues ... )
