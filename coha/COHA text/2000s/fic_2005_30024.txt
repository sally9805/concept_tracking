One " The school looks exactly the same , " Alexis Chappel told her brother , Adam . Together they walked from the parking lot across the grounds of their former elementary school , toward the huge banyan tree that sheltered the playground . " I have n't thought about this place since we moved , " Adam said . " Everything looks so small . " " That 's because we 're bigger , " Alexis said . " And I used to think about it all the time . I really missed it when we moved . " Their family had relocated to the southwest side of Miami during the summer following fourth grade , and twins Adam and Alexis had transferred into a brand-new elementary school . Alexis remembered how she had cried because she had loved Woodland Elementary , which was just around the corner from their old house . The low-slung building of white stucco , yellow brick and awning-covered windows looked tired and dingy to her now , eight years later . " You think we 'll recognize anybody ? " Adam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Beneath the giant tree , Alexis saw a diminutive woman with a frizzy mass of red hair herding a group of children toward rows of benches . Behind the benches there were several rows of chairs where teens sat , some talking , some eating slices of pizza and sipping canned sodas . " Is that our class ? " Adam asked , pausing to check out the group . " Did you expect everybody to be six ? " Alexis teased . " The letter said our classmates would be invited . " Adam was the shyer of the two , and Alexis usually felt as if she was either pushing him or dragging him to do something . But then , Adam 's life had been a whole lot more difficult than hers . Ms. Lola looked up , saw themand dashed over , her face lit with a smile . " I 'm so glad to see you . My beautiful twins . Do you know that in all my years of teaching , I 've only had three sets of twins in my classes ? But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about telling you apart ! " She hugged them , and a jumble of warm , fond feelings flooded through Alexis . To this day , she 'd never loved a teacher the way she had loved Ms. Lola . " You both look wonderful ! Come , join the others , " the teacher said . She led them to the rows of chairs and began to introduce them to eleven former classmates . Alexis smiled and waved at each person , recognizing names because she had pored over their first-grade class photo and roster before coming . There had been twenty-eight in the class . Some she knew from the old photo , but others looked totally different . " Grab yourself some goodies and have a seat , " Ms. Lola said , then rushed off to greet a group heading across the playground . " Want a soda ? " Adam asked . " Sure . I 'll save you a spot . " Once Alexis had settled in , a girl two chairs over asked , " Remember me ? Linda Cummings . I sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember . " Alexis flashed her brightest smile . " You had long , curly brown hair . " Linda 's hair was now short and was dyed pink and red . " And you wore a long braid that usually had ribbons going through it , " she said . " I used to sit there and wonder what it would be like to have such pretty , straight black hair . " " It was monotonous . Nothing I did then or do now makes it curl . " Linda 's gaze lingered on Alexis 's long hair . Finally she shifted self-consciously and asked , " Where are you going to high school ? " " South Kendall . And you ? " " North Miami High . " " It seems weird to be back , " Alexis confessed . " I 've lived in the same house since first grade . " Linda sounded apologetic about it . " Ms. Lola had no trouble tracking me down . I could n't stay away . I wanted to see how we all turned out . Plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capsule of hers . I do n't remember writing anything . How about you ? " " I ca n't imagine what I wanted when I was in first grade . That was ages ago . " Linda glanced toward Adam , who was putting pizza on paper plates . " I do n't remember what I wrote , but I remember what I wanted . I had the worst crush on your brother and wanted him to notice me . He 's still cute . " " He 's got a girlfriend . " " All the cute ones do , " Linda said with a sigh . She added , " I used to envy the two of you . " " You 're kidding . Why ? " " Because you got along really well together . My older sister and I fought like cats . I remember how you and Adam used to finish each other 's sentences . " " We still do . It 's because Adam and I were womb mates , " Alexis said . Their peculiar link with each other was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could almost read each other 's minds . Linda grinned . " Womb mates -- I get it . So who 's older ? " " I am . By seven minutes . " " Are you and Adam in classes together ? " " No . He 's into math and baseball . I like speech and debate . " " Debate . Is n't that when you argue with someone ? " " It 's really problem-solving competitions . Teams get proposals or resolutions in advance and prepare arguments for and against them . It 's fun . " The competitions were tough , but Alexis loved the high that came when she scored enough points from the judges to advance to the next round . She was team captain and had racked up more points than anyone on her school team so far . Mrs. Wiley , the debate coach , was already prepping Alexis and the team for the state tournament to be held in Tallahassee , the state capital , in the spring . " Do you want to be a lawyer ? " Linda asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attend law school . She supposed the tendency for high achievement ran in their family . Their father , Blake , was an attorney , and their mother , Eleanor , was a top-selling real estate agent and a community activist interested in running for public office . " Ambitious parents create ambitious kids , " Adam often said . " And one out of two is n't bad . With you , Ally , they 're batting five hundred . " Adam returned , bringing Alexis a cold lemon-lime soda , her favorite , and a plateful of pizza slices . She introduced him to Linda , whose face took on a pink hue when Adam said hello . " We were in the same class , " Linda said , stating the obvious and blushing again . " You want a soda ? " Adam asked . " Um , no thanks -- I mean , sure , thanks . " He gave her a quizzical look . " What flavor ? " " Yellow . I -- I mean , lemon-lime , like your sister 's . " Adam left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him I do n't get out much . "
