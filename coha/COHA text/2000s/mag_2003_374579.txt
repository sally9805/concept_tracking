When scientists struggle to explain the weird implications of quantum mechanics , in which electrons can spin simultaneously clockwise and counterclockwise or dart here and there at the same time , they often fall back on a scenario concocted more than a half-century ago by the physicist Erwin Schrodinger . <P> Put a cat in a box , he proposed , and rig up a Rube Goldberg contraption involving a hammer , a vial of poison and a quantum triggering device . If an electron is in one position , the hammer will remain safely cocked . But if the electron moves into the opposite location , the hammer will drop , smashing the vial and killing the cat . <P> The laws of quantum mechanics hold that as long as the electron remains undisturbed , it hangs in limbo , occupying both its possible states . The cat , by extension , is both dead and alive . <P> Scientists still disagree over just what to make of Schrodinger 's thought experiment . But that has not stopped them from exploiting the bizarre rules of quantum physics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and off  --  registering 1 and 0 at the same time . As hard as it is to fathom , theorists have proved that such a machine  --  a quantum computer  --  could perform multitudes of calculations simultaneously , leaving the mightiest supercomputers choking in the dust . <P> In the latest of a steady stream of small developments , researchers in the Netherlands and Japan reported in the journal Science last week that they had caused an electrical current in a superconducting ring to flow simultaneously clockwise ( representing 1 ) and counterclockwise ( 0 ) . The result was a " qubit , " a quantum representation of both the digits of binary arithmetic . In other labs , qubits have been devised from single atoms . Whatever is used as the quantum abacus beads , the result is an exponential explosion in computing power . <P> Ordinarily a row of 10 bits ( think of them as tiny switches turned on or off ) can hold any one of a thousand different numbers ( 1,024 to be exact ) . But a row of 10 qubits , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . To find the square root of every number from 1 to 1,000 , you would load them all onto a row of 10 atoms , perform a single calculation , and  --  voila  --  all the answers would appear . <P> Every time you add a qubit to the string , the computing power doubles . A row of 11 atoms will carry out 2,048 simultaneous calculations , and a row of 12 will do 4,096 . By the time you get to just 14 atoms , a speck still far too tiny to see , you can do more calculations in tandem ( 16,384 ) than the fastest supercomputer in the U.S.  --  a machine at Los Alamos National Laboratory so voracious that it draws several megawatts of power . <P> Mathematicians have proved that a quantum computer with thousands of calculating atoms could rapidly find the factors of numbers hundreds of digits long  --  a problem that would take the best conventional supercomputers billions of years . Since the codes used to protect corporate and military secrets are based on factoring , this development is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scan huge databases of information , and the result could be , among other things , the ultimate chess master , a quantum Deep Blue .
