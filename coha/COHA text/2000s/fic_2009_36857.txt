Nia Youngblood crept down the hallway of a Las Vegas hotel behind her boyfriend , Malcolm Smalls , who was dressed like a spy in a black shirt , black shoes , black cap , and dark shades . When he paused , she paused . She shifted her duffel bag and tugged the back of his shirt . " Who are we looking for ? " <p> " The enemy . " <p> " But , Mal , it 's one o'clock in the morning and  --  " <p> " Shh ! " Malcolm placed a finger across her lips . <p> She pushed it away . " This is not how I planned on losing my virginity . You act like it 's Mission : Impossible . " <p> " No , it 's harder . " <p> Malcolm was right . At twenty-four , Nia 's love life was like a suspense thriller with every potential sex scene so far being a near miss . <p> Nia sighed . " I was hoping for a romantic candlelit dinner , maybe soft music ... " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hurried her down the long wine-colored carpet on the twenty-sixth floor of Treasure Island hotel . Malcolm had been her on-again-off-again boyfriend for six years since high school , but his appeal was beginning to wear thin . Twenty-nine and finally out of law school , he was already grabbing for fame and fortune , and right now a chance to get busy with Nia . After his court case had recessed for the day in Los Angeles , he 'd convinced her to hop a short flight to Las Vegas . He 'd told her he had a foolproof sexual rendezvous planned where they could escape whoever was making it impossible for him to make love to her . <p> Malcolm plunged his keycard into the door 's slot and rushed Nia inside the room . Although her hopes of a romantic first experience had been dashed , Nia remained excited and optimistic . Not a virgin by choice , but by circumstance  --  always unusual circumstances  --  she was more than anxious to explore the fiery side of her sexuality . <p> She dropped her duffel bag on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping that the intimate soul connection she 'd yearned for since puberty was about to happen . Malcolm put out the DO NOT DISTURB sign and quickly locked the door . <p> " Mal , relax . You 're making me nervous . " <p> " Shush ! " Malcolm tilted his head toward the door , listening . Nia listened , too , but only heard silence , though she knew silence did n't necessarily mean no one was there . Someone was always watching her . Someone possessive , jealous , and not necessarily human . <p> Nervous , she tugged at her thick sepia hair , twisting a wavy lock around her finger . Malcolm yanked the curtains closed , but a slither of light from the Vegas Strip remained . After checking the bathroom , he came out and complained , " Every time we try to do it , something crazy weird happens . " <p> Nia tried to downplay it . " It 's probably just coincidence . " <p> " Twenty-nine times ? " <p> " You counted ? " <p> " Every cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed it on the nightstand . " Nothing 's going to stop us this time , not even the hounds of hell . " <p> " Wow , Mal . Great romantic imagery . " Nia rolled her eyes . " Got any goblins to go along with those hounds ? " <p> She was n't worried about hellhounds . She knew hell had creatures far more dangerous and seductive than ornery mutts , and one of them kept a constant eye on her . <p> Mal snatched off his black cap and hurried out of his black clothes . He clicked off the lamp and rushed at Nia , popping buttons off her blouse . A melting hot surge rushed through her warm body , reminding her of all the nights she 'd fantasized about being with a real man . Aroused , her womanly places quivered , moistening with anticipation , but Mal was in such a hurry she had to struggle to catch her breath . <p> " Mal , slow down . " She grabbed his hand . " This is my first time . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get some , it will be special , " he said , but he saw the glare in her eye through the sliver of light . " What ? What else do you want ? " <p> " I want you to talk to me . " <p> " Talk ? " <p> " Yes , " Nia said . " Tell me what every woman wants to hear at a moment like this . " <p> He was clueless ; his brows wrinkled like a fault line . <p> She sat up , still waiting . " I 'm talking about the L word . " <p> " You 're a lesbian ? " Malcolm 's face caved in . <p> " Love ! " Exasperated , Nia huffed , " I want you to say you love me . " <p> Mal looked at her in amazement . " Why would you bring up something like that at a time like this ? Are you trying to kill the mood ? " <p> " Mal , it 's my first time . I 'm nervous . I need reassurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided the truth whenever possible . " And do n't lie to me , " she added . <p> Mal moved back , balancing himself on one elbow . He saw the seriousness in her eyes and came up with something . " You 're lucky , Nia . You 've got the lust factor . " <p> " The what factor ? " <p> " You 're a lust magnet . " He leaned in , talking more to her body than to her . " You 've got these joyously juicy breasts , wild tigress hair , and big sexy eyes that speak to men . " <p> " Oh , yeah ? " Nia widened her eyes . " What do they say ? " <p> " They say , ' Behind these big innocent eyes there 's a freak waiting to be unleashed . ' " <p> " Really ? " Nia exhaled , baffled . <p> " And that 's my mission  --  to unleash the freak in you . " He nudged her down on the bed . " So relax and let me bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a deep breath . Mal was n't her dream man , but he did have one crucial thing going for him  --  he stuck around . Despite the weird events that always surrounded her , Mal did n't ask questions . When she 'd break up with him  --  which she did frequently due to his lying , cheating ways  --  she 'd try to date other guys , but they 'd soon get scared away , and she 'd end up back with Malcolm . After six years of putting up with him , at least she knew what to expect . Plus , Mal 's appetite for sex was as huge as hers . Nia 's blood ran hot and her urges were intense but yet to be satisfied , and Mal made no secret of his horny intentions . <p> Suave in a self-absorbed way , Mal flashed his " practiced " smile , the one designed to win over jurors , and ditched his underwear . He crawled on top of her , smothering her mouth with kisses designed to keep it shut . Nia sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of her many sexual fantasies while she explored his male anatomy , touching fleshly objects she 'd only dreamed about . <p> Malcolm 's cell phone rang . <p> He ignored it and continued kissing , grappling , and grinding , but the phone kept ringing . <p> Distracted , Nia squirmed . " Mal , your phone is ringing . " <p> " Impossible . I turned it off , " he said dismissively , and parted her legs with his knee . The cell phone 's speaker clicked on by itself and a woman started leaving a message : <p> " Hello , Malcolm , you naughty sex machine . It 's Vicky . I 'm still reeling from that wild animal sex we had last night ... " <p> Malcolm jumped off the bed and reached for the phone , fumbling with it , trying to turn it off , but the speaker 's volume increased . " I got the video you e-mailed from your camera phone , you sly devil . I 'm watching it now and getting hot all over again . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chuckled nervously . " Obviously , it 's a wrong number . " <p> Nia gritted her teeth . " She said your name , Mal . " <p> " There are lots of Malcolms in the world , so do n't go jumping to conclusions . " <p> " Just do n't let our naughty video get out or both our careers will be in the toilet . I look forward to many more stiff sentences from you . See you in court tomorrow , you wild animal . Grrr ! " Vicky gave a lusty growl , then hung up . <p> Malcolm slammed the phone into the nightstand but it bounced off , ricocheted into Nia 's hands , and played the video of him and Vicky . Speechless , Nia watched the amateur porn of her boyfriend sexing a woman with gigantic breasts . Her palms shook with anger . <p> " It was n't me . " Malcolm threw up his hands . " I swear . " <p> Nia zeroed in on Malcolm 's face . Hot tears filled her eyes . <p> He mumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caving in . " C'm on , Nia , give me a break . Trying to have sex with you is harder than paying off a student loan . Every time I try , something crazy happens , like this ! " He pointed at the phone . " There 's something weird going on with you , Nia . " <p> " Mal ! None of this is my fault . " Insulted , she picked up a pillow and hit him with it . " Besides , you 're the one who cheated ! " <p> " Until there 's conclusive proof , I deny everything . " <p> Nia reached for her blouse and put it on , then quickly scooted into her pants . Mal paced the floor , scratching his head and muttering , " Who took that video ? " <p> Nia knew who 'd taken the video , but she was n't saying . " Does n't matter who took it . They did me a favor . " She grabbed her duffel bag , slung it over her shoulder , and headed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " <p> He followed her . " Hey , I paid for this room . There are no refunds . " <p> " Refund the six years I wasted with you . " She flung open the door . " Good-bye , Mal . " <p> At two a.m. , Nia caught a cab to the Las Vegas airport and boarded the next plane heading back to Los Angeles . In late November , the desert city known for its sin and heat was chilly , but Nia wore no sweater . She did n't even own a coat , because she did n't need one . Among other weird things about her , Nia 's body always ran hotter than normal . <p> As Nia boarded the plane , she wiped smudged mascara from her eye . She hated wearing makeup , but Malcolm liked it . Once again , she 'd tried her hand at romance but things had only gotten worse . Nia searched for her seat while wracking her brain trying to remember where she 'd seen Vicky before . Disheartened , she slumped into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The woman in the blue uniform approached . " Excuse me , miss , but where did your companion go ? " <p> " My companion ? " Baffled , Nia sniffed back a tear . " I 'm traveling alone . " <p> The attendant pointed to the seat next to Nia , the only empty seat in first class . " The gentleman asked me to make sure no one took his seat . He seemed very protective of you . " <p> Suddenly alert , Nia shifted uneasily . " What did he look like ? " <p> After all these years , she 'd never actually seen his face . The attendant described him as best she could . " A tall , well-dressed gentleman in a dark magenta suit . I could n't really see his face because the cabin lights malfunctioned , but he seemed the quiet type , with a very powerful presence . Almost overwhelming , you know ? " <p> Yes , Nia knew . <p> The attendant continued , " He had an exotic look , perhaps a foreign citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be surprised if he was royalty of some kind since he had such a commanding presence and a definite edge . " <p> " An edge ? " <p> " Yes , like someone you would n't want to cross . " <p> Nia remained purposely expressionless , though her insides turned to mush . <p> " We 're ready for takeoff , but he 's nowhere in sight . " The attendant backed up slightly , disappointed . " We may have to take off without him . " <p> Antsy , Nia sat back in her seat . She fastened her seat belt and tightened the strap . " He 'll show up again . He always does . " <p> As the attendant left , Nia looked again at the empty seat . Out of nowhere , a rose appeared . A single long-stemmed rose with thick , velvety petals in the lavish color of royalty  --  purple . Attracted by its mystique , Nia picked up the purple rose . She slowly ran her fingers along its long , smooth black stem ; its razor-sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensation through her body . A densely sweet , familiar smell emanated from the rose , like burning molasses . Nia 's body temperature increased the way it always did whenever he was near , and minuscule beads of perspiration replaced the dried-up tears on her cheeks . <p> During takeoff , she brought the petals close to her cheek , brushing their velvety thickness gently across her lips . " Please , " she whispered into the rose , knowing he could hear her , " just let me go . " Copyright 2009 by Lois Roberson Kimp <br> Continues ...
