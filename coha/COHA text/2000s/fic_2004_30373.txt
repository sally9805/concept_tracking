Chapter One The Beginning The moment . It happened when we were thirteen and had something to do with thighs , music and our mothers . We 've never been able to describe it exactly . We only know that it transpired at some point during that conversation in the locker room . And that it changed our lives . During times of crisis , I suppose it 's good to keep the beginning in mind - if only for something to hold on to as the world collapses around you . As I drove to the airport on that dark December morning , I filled my head with the memory of our first meeting , hoping to calm my fears with the sweet recollection of how simple adolescence could be . " Do you think Mrs. Wilder knows she has cellulite on the back of her thighs ? " That was the first thing she ever said to me . She being the cool girl from my gym class who did n't seem the type to wonder about things like that . Probably because I was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely was n't cool . But there 'd always been something different about this girl . She was n't popular-cool - no one in the popular crowd stood out the way she did . This girl was intriguing . I think it was the way she wore her confidence - subtle , detached and full of power , like she just might be some kind of rebel . Who would 've known that underneath it all , she wondered about cellulite , too ? " I like your shirt , by the way , " she said , glancing down at my chest . Milli Vanilli had n't become common fodder for comedy sketches yet . " Thanks ! I did n't actually go to the concert , though , " I admitted . " I got it at the mall . " " Oh , well , that 's probably better . Things are always way over-priced at concerts , anyway . " " True , " I agreed , not that I knew . I 'd only been to one in my entire lifetime - a Michael Jackson concert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't quite sure how this ranked on the scales of seventh-grade coolness . " I 'm Emily , by the way , " she said , flashing a smile of gums and dimples that was both inviting and , at the same time , too quick to let any visitors stay . " I 'm Stella , " I said , smiling back , though I was sure with a little less charm . " My mom was A Streetcar Named Desire fanatic . She said I was conceived during that famous scene where Marlon Brando stands on the street screaming , ' Stella ! ' " This last part was a lie and my imitation was hideous , but I thought it made me sound interesting . " That 's sexy , " Emily said , her voice slipping into a low and seductive key . And then she just kind of stared at me for a few seconds . I found the strange silence ironically cozy . " So , do you think she does ? " she asked finally . " Do I think who does what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows she has cellulite on the back of her thighs ? " And there it was . The question that had started it all . " She could n't possibly , " I reasoned . " Or she would n't wear her shorts so short . " " It 's a shame , " Emily said wistfully , " because she 's pretty hot for a teacher . Do n't you think ? " I had always found Mrs. Wilder uncannily attractive for Willowood Junior High , but I was n't used to referring to other women as " hot . " Emily , on the other hand , seemed to own a language untainted by overusage and unhindered by what other people thought . " She is hot , " I agreed , experimenting with the word . I felt liberated and embarrassed at the same time and knew by Emily 's smile that she 'd already embraced me as her devoted trainee . " I guess nobody 's perfect , " I added , wondering if Emily was . " I guess not , " Emily said with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of class . " Do you have lunch now ? " I asked . " No , algebra , " she said , rolling her eyes . " I 'll see you Thursday . We can stare at Mrs. Wilder 's cellulite together and secretly think she 's hot . " " I can hardly wait , " I said , using my best " do me " voice to let her know I shared her sense of humor . " Stella , " she said reflectively , before turning to walk away . " That 's a really cool name . My mom was a Laura Nyro fanatic . She named me after the song ' Emmie ' and died when I was three . " That afternoon , I discovered Eli and the Thirteenth Confession - or more precisely , my mother pulled the one Laura Nyro album she owned out of the dust stacks in our attack - and on it was the song that would forever remind me of the girl who , in one indescribable moment , left a lasting impression . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel more excited and alive than I actually knew was possible , more like the " me " I 'd always wanted to be . Something that made me look forward to gym class . I fell asleep that night with the song stuck in my head , wondering if Emily was thinking about her new friend from the locker room and if my parents would ever adopt her . It was that instinct right there - to care for Emily - that would accompany me through the next fifteen years of my life . Fifteen years is a long time to know somebody . And no matter how old you are going in to knowing that person , you grow up . You change . God knows , Emily and I did . But the important thing is that we changed together and never actually grew apart . For all those years of change and growth and experience , I thought nothing could break us apart . But I was n't prepared for Europe . Emily 's phone call came at four o'clock on that dark December morning , ripping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that was n't the point . The point was that things had changed in a way I could have never prepared myself for . We always said we 'd be best friends no matter what , right ? she 'd asked me in a tearful panic . A rhetorical question if ever I 'd heard one , but that was before she told me the news . Just promise me , Stella , she 'd begged . Promise you 'll never forget us . Emily , you 're not making any sense . If you tell me what happened , then maybe I can - And that 's when she dropped her bombshell - just like that , from thousands of miles across the ocean - and my entire world came undone . I arrived at the airport in a flood of fear and sadness . It did n't even matter about the wait , having to sit for all of those hours with nothing but my own mind for company . I had nowhere else to go , nothing else to do , no place else I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was safe . It would take me three flights to get to her . Taking off and landing . Connecting . And taking off again . The whole process dragging out and repeating until one day turned into the next . And in the meantime - the time that separated me from Emily 's frightening reality overseas - all I could do was wait and think ... as the seconds turned into minutes , turned into hours , and became my whole life . Sisters of the Moon Philadelphia International seemed the perfect place to come unglued . Nobody knew me . Nobody cared . Nothing in the atmosphere existed to remind me of Emily . But still , I thought of her . Though , I thought of the old Emily , the one that had never made a transatlantic phone call on a dark December morning we 'd remember for the rest of our lives . I thought of thirteen-year-old Emily and the way we were at Willowood when times were simple . And somehow , these memories were enough to hold me together . Tinkerbell . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She reminded me of the little revolving Tinkerbell in my jewelry box from grade school . A tiny blue-eyed china doll . But one that carried whips and chains . I guess the contradiction was what I found most alluring . Here was a girl who could n't have weighed more than a morsel , but had enough attitude to propel both of us through the murky shit-mine our school board liked to call junior high . Before her , I was just a miserable suburban kid dreading my first period and praying each night for boobs to balance out my thighs . Instead of boobs , I got Emily . The period followed soon after and my thighs continued to spread like yesterday 's news . ( Continues ... )
