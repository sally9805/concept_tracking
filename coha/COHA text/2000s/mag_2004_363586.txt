The British insist that Dizzee Rascal has all the right rap values . He hates violence , cops and teen pregnancy ; he likes parties , sneakers and sex . Americans will just have to take it on faith , because entire songs fly by on Dizzee 's debut album , Boy in Da Corner , in which nothing recognizable as a word rises above the computer-generated whirs and beats . Occasionally you can hear Dizzee scream his name , and attentive listeners might even catch him boasting about being unstoppable . But a lot of Boy in Da Corner sounds like Michael Caine speed-reading P. Diddy 's biography in a video arcade . <P> The problem is n't just that Dizzee 's East London accent is thick , though it is . It 's that Dizzee ( ne Dylan Mills ) , 19 , speaks in a tangled local idiom in which choppah means knife , chaps are chains and sket means slut . In Britain , where most rappers still spit moldy American hip-hop cliches , Dizzee is celebrated as a rap original . ( Boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the country 's prestigious Mercury Prize . ) But American audiences  --  who get Dizzee 's album on Jan. 20 , six months after the Brits  --  have a right to ask : What , exactly , is rap without words they can understand ? <P> On first listen , not much . But a few tracks on Boy in Da Corner transcend their initial incomprehensibility . Dizzee is a big fan of jungle  --  an electronic dance style that mixes chaotic rhythms with everyday sounds  --  and his production skills are first-rate . With frenetic beats below and threatening ambient noises , like sirens and whizzing bullets , hovering on top , I Luv U and Sittin ' Here effectively re-create midnight in London 's housing projects . When Dizzee lets loose with some of his staccato chirps , the musical tension only increases . His tongue is definitely twisted , but at least his ears are in great shape .  --  By Josh Tyrangiel
