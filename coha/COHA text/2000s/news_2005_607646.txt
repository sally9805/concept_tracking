<p> Obviously , Phil Mickelson knows how to do this now . He knows how to lead a major championship start to finish with pressure hanging all over him like a too-heavy topcoat . He knows how to play through weather delays and wind shifts , and how to sleep on a three-foot putt for par without letting it ruin his mind . He knows how to close out a major with a big shot on 18 , and that is the best possible news for golf . <p> With his PGA Championship , Mickelson , 35 , has turned into the player he should be . There was n't much Mickelson did n't overcome in this over-long tournament on the 7,392-yard Baltusrol Golf Club course . The rough was deep , the fairways were narrow , the temperature was punishing and the leader board was packed . There were thunderstorms and wicked reversals : In Sunday 's final round , Mickelson went from three strokes up to two strokes back , and he went to bed after the storm-shortened round with the tournament still not over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Monday . Finally , he clinched the thing with that nervy 18th hole . <p> " It was hard fought , " Mickelson said afterward . " I think it was one of the most stressful tournaments for me because I was on the lead or at the lead or tied every night . There was an extra night thrown in there for good measure . I 'm looking forward to be able to relax for a day or two . " <p> There is no more welcome arrival in golf than that of Mickelson as a regular winner of majors . He is a strapping and charismatic player , adored by an audience with whom he genuinely connects , a rare thing in a sport that fosters remoteness . Throughout the last four holes , he was buffeted down the fairways by spontaneous waves of applause . While other players stood in the fairways still as wax figures , Mickelson radiated energy and fixed a crooked grin on his face , and if it sometimes looked forced , the message it sent was that he understood the job of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Be the ball , Bay-bee ! " they yelled as Mickelson strode up the 18th . <p> " Come on Phil , drop a bird on ' em . " <p> " Birdie , birdie , birdie , Phil . I got ta get to work . " <p> There are legions of good players who have won one major championship . Ben Curtis , Davis Love III , Steve Jones , David Toms , Hal Sutton , Wayne Grady and Shaun Micheel , just to name a few . But there are only 74 players who have won two or more majors . It is a critical separation , as any player will tell you . Now that Mickelson has hoisted his second large trophy , you get the feeling it wo n't be long before he joins the even more select group of 41 players with three or more in their career . " You arrogantly think that if you won one , the rest of them are easy , " Love said . " The second one is just as hard . That 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or five of them , he 's looked upon a little differently than the rest of the players . One major puts you in the club . But it 's just in the club . " <p> By capturing the PGA , Mickelson is now in a different club altogether  --  and the manner of his victory set him apart , too . Twice now , he has won majors with birdies on the 72nd hole . Mickelson , once regarded as a somewhat soft and lazy player , is acquiring a reputation for toughness . At last year 's Masters , it was an 18-foot putt to beat Ernie Els . At Baltusrol , he came to the last tee tied with Steve Elkington and Thomas Bjorn at 3 under par , and flat out seized the trophy from them . While his wedge will be remembered as the glamour shot , he actually hit three near-perfect shots in succession : a dead center drive , a launched 3-wood that almost reached the green before it just faded , and then that gutsy , fist-clenching chip from the heavy rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd back to get up-and-down from there , it 's Phil Mickelson , " Bjorn said . " He 's not a one-major guy , he 's a 10-major guy . He 's going to go on now and contend for majors as he 's always done , but it 's going to be easier and easier for him to win them now . " <p> Mickelson 's evolution into a major champion has not been easy . In fact , it 's been agonizing to watch . But it 's been a valuable lesson , too ; what it teaches is that you can learn to win . Winning is not just a quality some people are born with and others are n't . He was winless in his first 43 majors as a pro . A baffling 22 times , he finished among the top 10 without lifting a trophy : eight times in the Masters , seven times in the PGA , six in the U.S. Open , and once in the British Open . <p> Mickelson admitted on Monday , with the luxury of hindsight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to him , that he did n't manage himself well early in his career and played some foolish golf . When he watched highlights of himself , " I just think , what was I doing ? " <p> That phase is over now . Mickelson knows what he is doing . At Baltusrol , he knew what he doing better than anyone else because he has learned how to prepare . He was here two weeks early , playing practice rounds . It was during those sessions that he and his coach , Rick Smith , came up with their game plan to sacrifice distance in favor of power fades that would stay in the fairway and take trouble out of play . Also , he consulted with the club pro , who gave him a valuable tip about the way putts tended to break . One of the things he was proudest of afterward was that , even when he missed some shots , he missed them in the right way , and in the right place . " I made four or five bogeys but each bogey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I could get up and down , " he said . <p> That Mickelson has acquired the self-control , and self-effacement , to sacrifice distance for accuracy is an interesting development . And that he has acquired the self-confidence to will himself to a major victory is an even more interesting development . Nobody played particularly well among the leaders  --  four of the top five finishers shot rounds over par , the exception being Tiger Woods , who , had he not continually stubbed his toe , might have won the tournament . Mickelson struggled with near fatal tentativeness in the middle of his own round . But in the end , the right guy won . Mickelson found an inner firmness and outplayed all of his pursuers with better decisions and better execution . To birdie the 18th in a major , as he pointed out , " You 've got to make good , confident , aggressive swings . " <p> The guess here is that now Mickelson has decided he is a real closer , he may win scads of pro majors , and give Woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 . Mickelson has now shared the 54-hole lead twice in majors . Guess what his record is ? It 's 2-0 . " When you lead from Day One and you stand there on with the trophy in hand on Sunday , you certainly deserve to win , " said Bjorn . " He 's come so close for so many years , and the way he did things this week was better than the next guy . " <p> From now on , he may be better than just about all of them .
