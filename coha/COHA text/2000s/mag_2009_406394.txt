Cheryl Drewniak 's nine-year-old daughter , Hailey , never did like meat much . " My husband and I were constantly pleading with her to ' take one more bite . ' This past spring , Hailey announced to us that she wanted to become vegetarian . Naturally , we were worried . We are not vegetarians and we were concerned about how she would get all her nutritional requirements . " This is often the age when kids become aware of the vegetarian option and want to try it , says Montreal dietitian Louise Lambert-Lagac . How should parents react ? It 's important to find out what 's prompt- ing the change . Some kids , like Hailey , find the taste or texture of meat unpal- atable . Others may be concerned about animal welfare or the environment . But the choice may also be hiding an eating disorder . " I see this over and over again in my practice , " says Lambert-Lagac . " Girls especially may want to lose weight , and declaring themselves vegetarian is one way to avoid eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disorder is suspected , Lambert-Lagac recommends regular visits with a nutritionist to make sure the diet is well balanced and not an excuse to lose weight . If your child 's motivation is healthy , be supportive , advises Lambert-Lagac . " I see parents who absolutely refuse , and want me to back them up . But that 's not going to help the child . " Hailey , a gymnast , had learned from her coach that it 's possible to get good protein without eating meat . A vegetarian diet can supply all the nutrients a preteen needs . But it 's not enough to prepare chicken , rice and salad for the family and allow your vegetarian to eat just rice and salad . The need for protein and iron is at an all-time high at this age because of rapid growth and the imminent onset of puberty . Low intake can mean a drop in energy and , over time , a slowing of the growth curve . Beans , lentils and tofu supply good protein and iron ; one serving should be eaten every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are good snacks for vegetarian children . Dairy products and eggs provide protein as well , but are lower in iron . " Calcium is not usually a concern as long as the child is getting three or four servings of milk a day , " says Lambert-Lagac . A vegetarian in the family does n't mean you need to cook two meals . Invest in a good vegetarian cookbook , and invite your child into the kitchen to help you create meatless dishes from Mexican , Indian and Asian cuisines . And think in terms of substitutions : A vegetarian lasagna is delicious with tofu replacing some of the cheese ; a stir-fry can be divided before adding chicken to one portion and tofu to the other ; soy " ground round " can stand in for meat in chili . Drewniak says there has been an expected benefit to her daughter 's vegetarianism . " Her older brother , Dawson who 's 11 , a true meat-and-potatoes man , gets some exposure to new foods - and my husband and I pay closer attention to meal planning to ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
