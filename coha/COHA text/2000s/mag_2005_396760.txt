Section : family healthy home Nontoxic strategies for keeping bugs and rodents at bay <p> We like to shake our fingers at big farms and businesses for using chemicals that could taint our food and water . Although farms are the biggest users of pesticides , can you guess who 's second ? In 2001 ( the most recent year for which the EPA has data ) , home-and-garden use added up to 163 million pounds  --  30 million more than business and government combined . <p> It 's easy to see why we spray : Particularly in the fall , houses are invaded by crawling , scurrying , and flying pests  --  many of which carry germs , allergens , even diseases  --  and they 're all looking for a warm place to spend the cooler months . Though the EPA regulates sprays , baits , and bombs for safety , testing was not required on new pesticides until 1972 . As a result , many common pesticides that have been around for more than 30 years were never studied for long-term safety . And even ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , children exposed to any pesticide in their first year of life are more than twice as likely to get asthma as are kids exposed to none , found a University of Southern California study of about 700 children . <p> The smartest way to avoid pesticide use is to roll up the welcome mat before critters infest . Caulking foundation cracks , cleaning cluttered floors , keeping food tightly sealed , and covering trash cans all work well . If creatures do sneak in , however , try these safe options . Rodents <p> Though Disney has created many lovable mice , do n't confuse them with the vermin in your house . Yours leave unsanitary droppings and can spread serious , albeit rare , illnesses , including the infectious lung disease hantavirus . <p> <p> Avoid most commercial rodent baits They contain anticoagulants , which cause a slow death by internal bleeding . The poison pellets can be just as lethal when children ingest them . More commonly , cats ( a great mouse deterrent ) can die after catching poisoned pests . <p> <p> Try snap traps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traps ( not setting enough is the main reason this method fails ) . Arrange them along walls and under cabinets , and ditch the clich cheese bait ; uncooked rolled oats or peanut butter works best  --  especially when you change it every few days . Fleas <p> They 're not just a problem for pets ; these bloodsuckers will make you itch , too . <p> <p> Avoid conventional flea treatments They often contain carbamates  --  highly toxic poisons that can overstimulate the nervous system , causing nausea , dizziness , and at high exposures , seizures and even death . <p> <p> Try steam cleaning carpets Also wash all loose rugs and pet bedding in hot water to kill fleas and their eggs . Vacuum regularly and dispose of the bag outdoors . While you 're on a cleaning spree , bathe your furry pals ( cats , too ) with pet-friendly shampoo and use a flea comb until the problem is solved . Termites <p> These wood-dwelling ( and munching ) pests cause billions of dollars in home damage every year , according to the USDA Forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your entire house " Ninety percent of termite problems are around porches , " says Jay Feldman , executive director of the nonprofit group Beyond Pesticides in Washington , DC . " So there 's usually no need to treat the whole house "  --  especially when the remedy is sulfuryl fluoride , a gas that the EPA lists as highly toxic ; up to a teaspoonful can be fatal if swallowed , inhaled , or absorbed through the skin . <p> <p> Try Bora-Care This boric acid system is a low-toxicity pesticide that 's a stomach poison for termites . It also protects the wood from becoming a food source for pests in the future , thus preventing new infestations . ( Ask your pest-control professional about it . ) Ants and Cockroaches <p> Talk about creepy crawlers : They bring in bacteria and allergens that can cause or exacerbate asthma . In the University of Southern California study on children and asthma , kids exposed to cockroaches were twice as likely to develop the condition as those with no contact . <p> <p> Avoid bug sprays It 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemicals that block nerve impulses and paralyze the insect . The trade-off : They 're the most likely pesticides to cause acute poisoning in people , notes Feldman . <p> <p> Try soapy water Simply fill a spray bottle and fire away ; it safely rains on an ant parade by cleaning the chemical signposts left by the insects , stopping the rest of the colony in its tracks . For roaches , use store-bought sticky traps , or make your own by placing a piece of banana ( roaches prefer the smell and taste ) inside a Mason jar and lining the inside rim with petroleum jelly . Place the jars under sinks and near where pipes enter the home . Soon roaches will crawl in to feast but wo n't be able to escape from the slippery lip . Once you 've pinpointed where they congregate , use a hand applicator to inject boric acid , a low-toxicity mineral available at home centers , into nearby cracks and crevices . ( The acid is abrasive to the insect 's exoskeleton , causing dehydration and then death . ) Moths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually eat wool . It 's the larvae of certain moths that can turn sweaters into Swiss cheese . <p> <p> Avoid mothballs They 're either made of the chemical naphthalene or paradichlorobenzene . The EPA says the former has been proven to cause cancer in female mice ; both can cause liver and kidney damage in humans if ingested . <p> <p> Try freezing woolen clothes Really . Chill your sweaters for a few days at the beginning and end of the season ; the sudden change of temperature kills larvae . If your icebox is n't big enough , visit the dry cleaner instead . Perspiration and food residue attract moths , so keeping woolens clean wards off larvae . To stop the pest from returning , tuck a dried lavender sachet in with your winter wears . Do n't forget the yard <p> Pesticides can easily be tracked from your lawn and garden into your home . Here are some safe alternatives to potentially toxic herbicides and sprays . <p> <p> Crabgrass Try sprinkling corn gluten meal ( available at eco-friendly lawn and garden centers ) on lawns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this flowers . The leaves taste like endive . Another reason to keep these weeds around : They attract ladybugs , which in turn eat aphids ( see below ) . <p> <p> Garden weeds Give bark mulch and plastic sheets a try to suffocate weeds . <p> <p> Lawn grubs Use milky spore , a safe , naturally occurring bacteria ( found at eco-friendly lawn and garden centers ) , to kill these yard-spoiling worms . <p> <p> Plant lice ( aphids ) Soak pests with a less insecticidal soap like Concern Insecticidal Soap . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Zap bug trails with soapy water <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Max Alexander <p> <p> Max Alexander , author of Man Bites Log , has struck a truce with armies of crawling things on his farm in Maine . <p>
