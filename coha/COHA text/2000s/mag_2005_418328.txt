Today 's marine engines are modern marvels combining strong performance and unprecedented fuel economy with durability . Even so , preventive maintenance is required to keep your engine from opting for an early retirement . Here are eight simple rules for maintaining a healthy inboard , outboard or sterndrive so that it will live to a ripe old age . 1 Change the crankcase oil and filter on schedule . Spent oil is acidic , abrasive and thick with sticky varnish . Ignoring a scheduled oil change , or even delaying it , gives this harmful stuff a chance to etch bearings and journals and pit cylinder walls . Even worse , sticky oil glues control rings in their piston grooves , causing an otherwise healthy engine to shamelessly burn oil . When changing oil , use a suction pump ; it draws old lubricant out of the crankcase and minimizes mess . Drain oil shortly after shutdown to keep impurities from settling in the sump. 2 Fog the cylinders . When a boat is left inactive for weeks on end , ambient air enters the combustion chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cylinder walls causing rust and pitting that abrades the compression rings . Fogging cylinders is an essential winter layup procedure , but periods of inactivity ( as short as two weeks ) can also warrant a couple shots of fogging oil down the air intake . Do it immediately before clicking off the key so that oil vapors coat the cylinder walls and valve stems , protecting them from corrosion. 3 Maintain the propeller . Damaged , out-of-balance propeller blades cause vibration that sends a shudder along the entire drivetrain . Driveshafts have been known to fracture from this type of beating . Usually , you can feel the vibration in the soles of your feet . Even if you ca n't , it 's still a good idea to regularly eyeball blades for nicks , and more importantly , for missing chunks of metal . 4 Go easy on the revs . Constantly running at wide-open throttle not only maximizes fuel consumption and dramatically increases operating costs , but it also prematurely wears out piston rings and crankshaft bearings . In sharp contrast , throttling back to cruising speed pays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smoothly humming engine logs significantly more hours before the time comes to put a wrench on it . 5 Keep it clean . Scrupulously scrubbed fuel means less wear and tear on carburetors and fuel injectors . Conversely , dirty fuel is like liquid sandpaper , with micron-sized particles eroding critical dimensions . Consider plumbing a dual-filter setup . This means two filters in series . The first one pulls out 30-micron or larger particles , the second one 10-micron particles . Obviously , a fuel/water separator is an important part of the package . Tip : In areas where fuel quality is dubious , per-filter fuel through a screened funnel right at the fuel dock . 6 Check gear case lube . As little as an ounce of water in the lower unit can spell doom for bearings and gears . The solution is as simple as the sea is salty : Regularly crack the bottom drain screw and determine whether oil or water issues forth . Also look forwads of monofilament fishing line that may have become wrapped around the prop shaft . If left in place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaft seal . 7 Keep it cool . Overheating is one of the major causes of premature death for marine engines . To prevent an untimely demise , pay attention to engine temperature . Consider rotating the temperature gauge so its needle points straight up when registering normal engine temperature . Then , if the temperature begins to rise you 'll see it immediately . Remember to inspect cooling system hoses for age or damage . 8 Maintain tune . An out-of-tune engine spills unburned fuel down the sides of the cylinder walls . Raw fuel washes away oil . Metal on metal causes extreme engine wear . Symptoms of an out-of-tune engine include rough running , lethargic performance and , sometimes , exhaust smoke . With gas engines the fix is often as straightforward as replacing sparkplugs and wires and cleaning the flame arrestor . On a diesel , the injectors may have to be rebuilt .
