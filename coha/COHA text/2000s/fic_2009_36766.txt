Pandora quickly unfastened the chain of the medallion that hung around her neck . Her hands were shaking slightly as she took it off and placed it in the velvet-lined jeweler 's box . She took a moment to draw a deep , steadying breath . It was stupid to be so frightened now . She had planned everything down to the last detail . No , nothing could go wrong . <br> The round medallion shone against the black velvet lining of the box . The morning sunlight streaming through the hotel room window picked out the design on its surface , a raised rose in full bloom pierced by a sword . She reached out one finger and touched the rose gently . She felt oddly naked without the necklace she had worn for the last eight years . She had a sudden impulse to snatch the lovely thing out of the box and fasten it around her neck again . It was hers , dammit . What if Philip just opened the package and then carelessly tossed the medallion into a drawer ? <br> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than six years . Undoubtedly there had been a parade of women through his bedroom in that time . Perhaps he 'd found one who could provide him with more than temporary satisfaction . Oh Lord , she must n't think of that . It hurt too much . She would n't think about it . He was n't married or engaged . She knew that for certain . It did n't matter if he had formed a liaison or not . She 'd soon take care of removing any woman who had taken his fancy . Philip belonged to her . She had a prior claim and would n't hesitate to state it . She knew Philip better than anyone on the face of the earth . Surely that would be a powerful enough weapon to oust any rival . And she had other weapons now as well . She would use them all if she had to . <br> Philip would n't throw the medallion into a drawer . He was the most possessive man she had ever known . When he had given her this medallion he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him would never be surrendered easily . <br> She snapped the box shut and reached for the most recent issue of Rolling Stone magazine . With efficient movements she wrapped the jeweler 's box and the magazine in plain brown paper and addressed it to James Abernathy , Philip 's London agent . From the gossip columns she knew Philip had spent a good deal of time in Great Britain during the last six years . Even if he was n't in London , Abernathy would know where to reach him . <br> Just as she finished there was a knock on the door . She stood and snatched up the package and her huge shoulder bag from the chair beside the desk . " Just a minute , " she called . <br> " Take your time , " came Neal 's deep voice . " I 'm in no hurry to listen to you destroy my new lyrics with that sandpaper voice of yours . " <br> A smile tugged at her lips as she crossed the room , and she felt some of her tension ease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She could n't remember how many performances he had made bearable for her in the past two years . <br> She threw open the door . " Then why do n't you sing them yourself ? " she asked Neal with a grin . " We both know you 've got a better voice . " She made a face . " Hell , Kermit the Frog has a better voice . " <br> " But Kermit the Frog does n't have your sex appeal , " he replied as he took her huge shoulder bag and slung it over his shoulder . " And neither do I. You may not be melodious , but you 're definitely commercial . " <br> " Thanks a lot , " she said . " If I was the least bit serious about all this nonsense , I 'd probably be crushed . " <br> " If you were serious , I would n't have said it , " Neal returned . " I 'd be working your ass off to make a musician out of you , instead of just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arm . " Come on , let 's get on the road . Pauly and Gene are already at the auditorium rehearsing . " One side of his mouth lifted in a lopsided smile . " They 're obviously more driven than we are , luv . " <br> She knew better than that , but said nothing as she closed the door and started down the hall toward the bank of elevators at the end of the corridor . " I 'm afraid we 're going to be even later than you think , " she remarked finally . " I have to stop at the post office and mail this package . " <br> There was a flicker of curiosity in Neal 's eyes as he glanced down at the package . In the four years he had known Pandora he could n't remember her either receiving or sending any mail . She seemed to live totally in the here and now . " I guess I can handle that . Is it important ? " <br> " Oh yes , it 's important . " Her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevator . She deliberately steadied it . She must n't be so transparent . She could tell by Neal 's expression that he 'd already noticed something was upsetting her . She 'd never be able to fool Philip , who had always been extraordinarily sensitive to her emotional state , if she could n't control herself better than this . <br> She lifted her chin and gave Neal a blindingly beautiful smile . " Very important . " Her smile suddenly faded , and a faint frown creased her forehead . " Do you remember last year when you were ill with the flu and I played Florence Nightingale ? " <br> He nodded . " How could I forget ? I 've never been so bitchin ' miserable in my life . " <br> " You said you owed me one . " <br> His eyes narrowed . " Are you calling in debts , Pandora ? " <br> She nodded . " I need a favor . " She moistened her lips . Heavens , this was hard . She had taken care of Neal because he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extracting payment now for what she had given freely . " I 'll understand if you do n't want to do it , but I thought I 'd  --  " <br> " Oh , for heaven 's sake , be quiet . Pandora . " The doors of the elevator slid open and Neal nudged her into the cubicle . " You 're my friend , dammit . " His thumb punched the lobby button . " If you want a favor , ask . It 's not a crime to need a little help , you know . " <br> " Okay . " She drew a deep breath . " I want you to move in with me . " <br> " What ! " <br> The doors of the elevator slid silently closed . <br> " Come in , Abernathy . " <br> James Abernathy hesitated a moment before he opened the polished oak library door . He was n't in any hurry to beard the lion in his den . He had deliberately taken his time getting to El Kabbar 's estate from his office in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the sheikh wanted to sign papers or relay instructions on the more delicate transactions of his multicorporation empire . In James Abernathy 's eyes , London was the only civilized corner of the world , and he could n't see why the sheikh insisted on living outside its environs . He realized that El Kabbar was a fine horseman and possessed one of the most famous stables in the Middle East . Still , there was Hyde Park in which to ride , and he was sure the facilities were more than adequate . This time , however , he was grateful for the delay of the drive before the coming interview . <br> Even over the phone he had been able to tell that the sheikh was not pleased at the news Abernathy had received in the morning 's mail . Abernathy had thought El Kabbar would be relieved that the blasted girl had surfaced at last . After all , they had been searching for her for over six years . Reigning sheikhs were notoriously arrogant and Philip El Kabbar was more difficult than most . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put up with that arrogance . There was n't any question that he 'd continue to do so , not in today 's economy . <br> When Abernathy entered the library El Kabbar did n't look any more pleased than he 'd sounded on the phone . His black brows were knit in a frown over stormy blue-green eyes . " Where is it ? " he asked curtly . <br> " I have it here . " Abernathy strode briskly forward and placed the package on the Sheraton desk . " I opened it , as I do everything addressed to you . " He paused before adding apologetically , " I had no idea it was anything of a personal nature . " He started to turn away . " Now , if you do n't need me . . . " <br> " Sit down and quit trying to escape , Abernathy . " El Kabbar was crossing the room with swift strides , his tall , lean body as lithe as a cat 's . From his clothes it was evident he had been about to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fervently wished the sheikh had continued with the plan . Perhaps he would have expended a little of his anger on his horse . <br> Abernathy repressed a sigh as he obediently sat down in the wing chair beside the desk . " Of course , Sheikh El Kabbar . I 'm only too happy to be of service to you . I merely did n't wish to intrude . " <br> " I doubt that I 'm going to be overcome with emotion , " El Kabbar said cynically . He flicked on the desk lamp before removing the plain brown paper from the package with impatient hands . " Unless that emotion is anger . You could say I 'm a trifle annoyed with our little runaway . " <br> " Not very little any longer , judging by the photograph on the cover of that magazine , " Abernathy said mildly . " You must remember that she 's no longer the child of fifteen she was when she disappeared . " <br> " Must I ? " El Kabbar asked as he opened the jeweler 's box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at the medallion , but his hand suddenly tightened , snapping the box shut . He picked up the copy of Rolling Stone and glanced at the picture . " A rock star . I should have known Pandora would pick a profession suited to her rather bizarre mentality . " <br> " She 's turned into quite a raving beauty , has n't she ? " Abernathy permitted himself a small smile . " Who would have thought such a little tomboy could be transformed into the woman in that picture ? " He had only seen the girl once , when he had picked her up at the airport some six years before . The next day she had decided to run away . She had left only a sealed note for Philip El Kabbar and a great deal of turmoil behind her . That girl had been thin and wiry , with silver-blond hair that had been brutally chopped into a boy 's cut . From the photograph it was clear all that had changed . Pandora Madchen 's features were by far the most classically beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were truly magnificent . In the white satin Grecian toga that bared one shoulder her slim body was everything a woman 's form should be . Her bosom might even be considered a little too voluptuous for her small body . It was n't likely any man would complain , however . Pandora emitted an aura of sensuality that almost reached out and touched , stroked . . . Abernathy shifted uncomfortably in his chair . It was a very disturbing quality . " Do you suppose that wild orange hair is dyed or a wig ? Why would she try to cover her own hair ? The color was quite lovely , as I remember . " <br> Philip El Kabbar did n't look up from the magazine . " A wig . But it would n't surprise me if she 's had her head shaved and is bald as a jaybird underneath the damn thing . There was n't a note ? " <br> Abernathy shook his head . " Just the magazine and the jeweler 's box . " <br> The sheikh picked up the magazine and crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose you 've read the article ? " <br> Abernathy shrugged . " Most of it . A good deal of it concerns the artistic merits of the group itself . Evidently Pandora and Nemesis are very well thought of by popular musicians . " <br> " Nemesis ? " Philip 's gaze lifted swiftly . <br> " That 's the name of the group itself . Rather fanciful , is n't it ? I wonder if she thought of it herself . " <br> " Probably . " Philip looked down into the heart of the crackling fire . " Give me the bare bones of the story . I can do without the critical review . " <br> " No one appears to know her last name in the United States . She 's known only as Pandora . Evidently that 's the thing to do in rock circles . It adds a certain mystique . " His lips pursed disapprovingly . " Most exasperating . Your detectives might have found her if she 'd used her surname . She 's been in the public eye for almost two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abernathy nodded . " The group had a hit single about that time and became very popular . The men in the group are all British , so it 's probable that she linked up with them here in London . " <br> " Then why did n't the fools find her ? No city is that large . " <br> " It 's understandable . They were looking in the wrong places . " Abernathy 's expression was faintly reproachful . " You gave us no hint that she was interested in music . You said she had ambitions as an equestrienne . " <br> " I also said that you could n't put her into any cozy pigeonhole , blast it . There are n't any limits where she 's concerned . She does n't even know they exist . " His hand clenched around the magazine . " Why the hell did n't they listen to me ? " <br> " I 'm sure they were thorough . Blackwell 's is an extremely efficient agency . " Abernathy could see that he was n't getting through and sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to hire the detective agency when the Madchen girl ran away . " Have you phoned her father in Sedikhan and informed him that she 's been located ? " <br> El Kabbar nodded curtly . " Right after you called me . He was n't at the dispensary so I left word with his assistant . " <br> " Undoubtedly he 'll be overjoyed when he hears the good news . " <br> " Undoubtedly , " El Kabbar said caustically . " He lost a horse-crazy fifteen-year-old and finds an orange-haired twenty-one-year-old rock star . He 'll be over the moon . " <br> " She 's still his daughter , " Abernathy offered quietly . <br> There was a short silence . <br> " Yes , she 's still his daughter , " El Kabbar finally said . " Whatever that means . Madchen never treated her with anything but complete indifference . When I told him she was missing his reaction was a philosophic shrug . No , you ca n't say they were exactly close . " <br> " Is that why she ran away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from Sedikhan to school here in England . " <br> " No , there was more to it than that . " El Kabbar 's lips were suddenly a tight line . " Nothing is ever simple when it comes to Pandora . " <br> " Is n't it ? " There was a note of speculation in Abernathy 's voice . <br> El Kabbar noticed it , and his lips curved in a cynical smile . " And , no , she was n't my mistress , Abernathy . I 've never indulged myself with teenage Lolitas . I like my bedmates with a degree of maturity and experience . " <br> Abernathy was well aware of that . El Kabbar 's latest affair had been with a beautiful opera singer who possessed both of those attributes . Still , he had wondered a bit at the sheikh 's reaction when Pandora Madchen disappeared . El Kabbar had flown to London at once and supervised the search personally for almost a year . That , in itself , had been unusual . His demeanor during that period had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man looked positively haggard . " I would never have intimated such a thing . I know that Dr. Madchen has been in your employ for a number of years . I 'm sure you would have been just as concerned for the daughter of any  --  " <br> " The devil I would , " El Kabbar bit out . " My employees are well taken care of , but I would n't go through that hell as part of any fringe-benefit program . " <br> Continues ...
