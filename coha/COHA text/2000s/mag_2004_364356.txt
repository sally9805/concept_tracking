What would make anyone quit a job as chief executive of a $15 billion company , turning her back on a career that earned her a spot on FORTUNE 's list of the world 's most powerful businesswomen ? For Canada 's Belinda Stronach , the answer was a no-brainer : the chance to become her country 's Prime Minister . Veteran politicians sneered when Stronach , president and CEO of Magna International , North America 's fifth largest auto-parts company , entered the race this year to become leader of Canada 's newly renovated Conservative Party . The battle was n't pretty . Near the end of the 57-day campaign , a prankster handed the glamorous but politically inexperienced Stronach a sweatshirt emblazoned with the words BETTER THAN VIAGRA . Stronach soldiered through to a respectable second-place finish  --  and made clear that a new Canadian star was on the horizon . <P> Stronach , 37 , has already cut a swath among the world 's corporate elites . Magna , founded by her Austrian-immigrant father Frank in a rural Ontario tool-and-die shop , has offices in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stronach 's philanthropic interests , which include running a national education foundation , took her beyond a focus on the bottom line . As she campaigned across Canada 's vast distances this winter , some admirers were already comparing her to the young Margaret Thatcher . " She generated significantly more glamour than I could bring , " conceded Stephen Harper , 45 , the victor in the leadership vote . Stronach is now expected to run for ( and win ) a seat in Canada 's Parliament in national elections , which are expected by summer . It 's rumored that if the Conservatives triumph , she would be named Minister of Industry or Trade . Few find it easy to make the transition from business to politics . Fewer have made money betting against Belinda Stronach.  --  By Stephen Handelman
