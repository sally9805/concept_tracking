Now I 'm double-parked by the curbside check-in and I ca n't get back into the car . <p> I do n't know , it does n't recognize my voice . Maybe the voice ID is busted , or maybe it 's this cold . I just got out to help your mother with the bags . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car . <p> Of course I asked it nicely . Are you being serious ? This is no joke , Beth . This is a security zone or whatever they call it and they are already starting to look at me funny . <p> I know you have to be in court , but I have an idea .
