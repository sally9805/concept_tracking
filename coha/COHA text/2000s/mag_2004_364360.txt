The man who runs Wal-Mart is fond of saying that no one can run the world 's largest company , you have to lead it . To CEO H. Lee Scott Jr. , 55 , that means being a combination talk-show host and taskmaster . Business meetings take place in an auditorium where praise and criticism are meted out with wit and a steely determination to get things right . Like his predecessor , David Glass , Scott is a modest man with a ready supply of pungent remarks . He has been on the receiving end too , as Wal-Mart 's critics harp about its low-wage jobs and sprawling stores . Scott has no apologies in stock for most of them . When the company does dumb things , it deserves the knocks , he says . But with 100 million patrons a week voting their opinion through their purchases , " we have to focus on the customer who does believe in us . " <P> Scott may be the last Wal-Mart CEO schooled by Sam Walton , the discount Dalai Lama , so it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam " created be preserved and communicated as the company expands across China and other global markets . That means empowering employees wherever they are , says Scott : " We can not grow if we are not a great place to work . "  --  By Bill Saporito
