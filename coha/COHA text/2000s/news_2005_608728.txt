<p> New York Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer and federal officials have stopped cooperating with each other in parallel probes of the U.S. insurance industry , and each has made separate deals with witnesses that render the witnesses less useful to the other side , according to people familiar with the case and legal experts . <p> State and federal officials jointly interviewed insurance executive witnesses until late April or early May , but since then cooperation has stopped , and they now conduct interviews separately , said sources familiar with the case . The sources spoke only on the condition of anonymity because of the continuing investigation . <p> At one point , a scheduled joint interview was canceled after federal officials learned that Spitzer staffers already had met separately with the witness 's lawyer and discussed a deal , one of the people familiar with the matter said . <p> " Everyone is all smiles when it comes to cooperation between the agencies , " says Jacob S. Frenkel , a former Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement lawyer and partner at Shulman , Rogers , Gandal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in truth , the competition for convictions and civil settlements is so intense that each regulator is putting its interest ahead of the public good . " <p> Interagency tensions were exacerbated by news leaks from a high-profile interview April 11 with legendary investor Warren E. Buffett , head of Berkshire Hathaway Inc . Buffett 's General Re Corp . unit is part of a wide-ranging probe into a product known as a finite reinsurance , which has been used by some buyers to make their earnings look better . Buffett is a longtime director of , and investor in , The Washington Post Co . Investigators have said he is not a target of the investigation . <p> Accounts of the closed-door session were published by news organizations the same day . Federal officials suspected Spitzer staffers of relaying information about the meeting that ultimately reached news reporters , according to two sources on the federal side . <p> The three-hour session , held at the Securities and Exchange Commission 's offices in New York , included federal prosecutors from the Justice Department and the Eastern District of Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michele Hirshman , Spitzer 's top deputy , said any suggestion that state officials leaked information from the Buffett meeting is " inaccurate and ridiculous . " She described the insurance investigations as separate but complementary and said prosecutors on both sides are experienced in dealing with parallel probes by other agencies . " At the end of the day , the investigations are producing good results in terms of finding the wrongdoing that was hidden from regulators for many years , " she said . <p> Representatives of federal officials leading the probe declined to comment . They are Paul J. McNulty , the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia ; David N. Kelley , the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York ; the Justice Department ; and the Securities and Exchange Commission . <p> Evidence of the breach surfaced soon after the Buffett interview . On May 2 , in a speech to business writers and editors in Seattle , Spitzer blasted the Bush administration for failing to investigate illegal practices in the insurance industry after Spitzer-led investigations resulted in 10 guilty pleas from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1 billion . Spitzer is running for the Democratic nomination for governor of New York . <p> " Not a word has come out of the White House about maybe there being a structural problem in the insurance industry , " Spitzer said , according to a Reuters report . <p> Since then , state and federal prosecutors have struck separate deals with key witnesses involved in the insurance probes . A key transaction to the investigations is a $500 million finite reinsurance deal between General Re and insurance behemoth American International Group Inc . <p> On May 26 , Spitzer filed a civil complaint against AIG and its top two former officials that , among other things , revealed that Joseph H. Umansky , former president of AIG Reinsurance Advisors , had given testimony compelled under New York 's criminal code . That disclosure makes it extremely difficult for federal officials to prosecute Umansky , according to Daniel C. Richman , a former federal prosecutor and professor at Fordham University School of Law in New York . Under a 1972 U.S. Supreme Court ruling , federal prosecutors must prove that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the compelled testimony . That difficult standard scuttled the prosecution , for instance , of former White House aide Oliver L. North in the Iran-contra affair . <p> " It 's a huge burden , " Richman said . <p> Umansky has not been charged with any wrongdoing . His lawyer , Seth L. Rosenberg , said , " Joe Umansky has cooperated fully with every internal and governmental investigation of AIG that has sought his cooperation . " <p> Then on June 9 and 10 , U.S. Attorney McNulty announced that two General Re executives had pleaded guilty in federal court to a single count each of conspiracy to violate federal securities laws in connection with the General Re-AIG deal . Both defendants , John Houldsworth , a former chief executive of an Irish subsidiary of General Re , and Richard Napier , a former senior vice president of the Stamford , Conn. , company , agreed to cooperate with prosecutors , according to court papers . New York state laws against double jeopardy impair Spitzer 's ability to prosecute the two men for the same underlying acts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coordination , both prosecutorial entities will see their cases suffer , " says Robert A. Mintz , head of white-collar criminal defense at New Jersey 's McCarter &; English LLP . <p> Jurisdictional jousting between state and federal authorities over white-collar cases has a storied history in New York , where Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau over decades has moved into banking and securities cases , which federal officials view as their turf . His failed prosecution of Bank of Credit and Commerce International in the early 1990s involved several clashes with the Justice Department . <p> The Spitzer-federal rivalry goes back to at least 2002 , when Spitzer accused Merrill Lynch &; Co. and stock analyst Henry Blodget of publishing tainted stock research that misled investors . The case triggered a wider probe of Wall Street research that was widely viewed as embarrassing to the SEC , which has primary responsibility to regulate the securities industry and eventually signed onto a $1.5 billion global settlement with a dozen brokerages . <p> The state and federal probes of insurance differ in important ways . Federal officials have been investigating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the SEC first asked AIG for records relating to its deals with Brightpoint Inc. , a Plainfield , Ind. , telecommunications provider . The probe ended last year with AIG agreeing to pay $126 million to the SEC and the Justice Department , in a settlement that also involved finite reinsurance AIG had sold to PNC Financial Services Group Inc. of Pittsburgh . <p> Federal prosecutors in Virginia , meanwhile , have been probing General Re at least since October 2003 , when they asked for records relating to finite reinsurance sold to Reciprocal of America , a Richmond malpractice insurer that collapsed the year before . <p> But the pace of the probe measurably quickened in October after Spitzer filed a suit accusing insurance brokers of bid-rigging , then turned his attention to other problems in the industry and to AIG and General Re . Joint interviews with witnesses began early in the year , people familiar with the matter said . <p> Cracks in the uneasy alliance soon appeared . On Dec. 30 , Berkshire disclosed that the SEC had made a " request " for information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Spitzer 's office issued a subpoena seeking " virtually identical documents and information . " <p> Spitzer and the SEC issued subpoenas to AIG the same day , Feb. 14 . The announcement and subsequent developments sent AIG 's share price plummeting and ultimately led to the ouster of AIG 's longtime chairman and chief executive , Maurice R. " Hank " Greenberg , the next month . Called to a deposition before SEC lawyers , federal prosecutors and Spitzer 's staff on April 12 , the day after the Buffett interview , Greenberg invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination . <p> Experts say they expect state and federal authorities to patch things up soon , or for one agency to cede the lead to another , to avoid serious damage to either probe . " It was just inevitable that jurisdictions would bump elbows , and sometimes they 're sharp , " Fordham 's Richman said . " But it 's hard to imagine it happening for long . "
