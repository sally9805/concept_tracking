<p> The trash-talking began well before the season did . <p> Calls and text messages were exchanged between Washington , Dallas , New York and Philadelphia throughout the summer , with players in each city boasting that they had the best team in the NFC East . All could agree on one thing  --  that after years of mediocrity , this was the most competitive division in the NFL . Nearly everything else was open to debate . <p> Washington Redskins defensive lineman Renaldo Wynn could tell from the area code alone which provocateur was on the line . Former teammate LaVar Arrington , fresh from a nasty divorce from Washington , was adamant that his new club , the New York Giants , would clobber the Redskins twice this season . Jeremiah Trotter , another former Redskin and an eager agitator , checked in frequently from Philadelphia to inform Wynn that after a one-year hiatus in the basement of the NFC East , the Eagles would rule again in 2006 . <p> Even a youngster who had yet to play his first NFL game  --  Sam Hurd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiver on the Dallas Cowboys  --  got in some verbal shots at the Redskins ' expense . It was a bold salvo for a rookie that , Wynn suspects , was made at the behest of Cowboys wide receiver Terrell Owens . <p> Beginning today , months of rhetoric will be put to the test , with the NFC East opening its divisional schedule with several teams having struggled in Week 1 . By the time the Redskins ( 0-1 ) meet their arch-rival Cowboys ( 0-1 ) at Texas Stadium tonight , the Eagles ( 1-0 ) and Giants ( 0-1 ) will already have played . <p> Half the division could remain winless entering the third week of the season . The Redskins and Cowboys have additional pride at stake , renewing a 46-year feud before a national television audience . <p> " Our guys get revved up talking to the guys on the other teams , " Wynn said . " They all think they 're the team to beat , and we feel that we 're the team to beat . I always talk to LaVar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the division , but they 're going to whip the crap out of us , too . Trot , in Philadelphia , they feel they 're healthy again and heading in the right direction and they 're coming for us . And my nephew , he 's with T.O . a lot , so that rubs off on him , and now my whole family is trash-talking , too . <p> " I love it . That all just gets me pumped up , and however you get that extra motivation you thrive off that . Everyone has a different perspective ; everyone thinks they 're the guy . So we 've got to take care of business when we play in the division . " <p> The Redskins , who lost 19-16 to Minnesota last week , set spending records on acquiring players and coaches during the offseason , revamping the offense . Dallas beefed up its defense and added Owens , one of the league 's premier athletes and sideshows . Philadelphia replaced Owens with wide receiver Donte Stallworth . The Giants , who handed Washington its lone NFC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arrington and retooled a spotty secondary . <p> " No one sat on their hands in this division , " said Joe Bugel , the Redskins assistant head coach-offense whose days in the division go back more than 20 years . " The NFC East is back , man . It 's like it was back in the 80s . " <p> NFC East teams compiled 36 wins last season , tied with the AFC West for the most in football . Within the NFC , the East dominated , going 16-8 outside the division . New York , the reigning division champions , and Washington won 10 games apiece and the Cowboys won nine . The Redskins caused the most havoc in the division , going 5-1 against NFC East opponents , with decisive victories over the three other teams down the stretch to clinch their first playoff appearance since 1999 . <p> " It lets you know you can play with those guys , " said running back Rock Cartwright , a 2002 draft pick . " Early on when I was here , we were just one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do anything in this division . " <p> Washington , which last enjoyed such a prosperous record in the NFC East in 1991 , its last Super Bowl season , was just 3-15 in the division from 2002 to ' 04 . Whether last season 's turnaround will carry over is anything but ensured . <p> " Last year do n't mean a thing , " said defensive tackle Cornelius Griffin , a Giant before signing with the Redskins in 2004 . " It 's was nice to go 10-6 and make the playoffs , but we 're going to be judged on what we do now . " <p> A year ago , the Redskins first tasted divisional success in Week 2 at Dallas . The Cowboys had won 14 of the previous 15 meetings between the two teams . But Mark Brunell hit wide receiver Santana Moss on two long passes in the final minutes to pull out a 14-13 victory in the Monday night game , Washington 's first win at Texas Stadium since 1995 . <p> " I got home and had a couple of voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the win , ' from people who had turned the game off and gone to bed not realizing that the Redskins had come back and beat us , " Cowboys quarterback Drew Bledsoe said during a conference call with reporters . " It was a disappointing game for us , certainly , but we were able to bounce back from that . " <p> When the teams met again in December , both were fighting for the playoffs . The Redskins dominated from the opening snap in a 35-7 win , their largest margin of victory ever against the Cowboys . They swept Dallas for the first time since 1995 and made the playoffs , while the Cowboys sat home knowing a split with the Redskins would have put them in the postseason and not Washington . <p> " When I first came here in 2002 , we had that streak of losing to Dallas , and I was like , ' Who cares ? ' " Wynn said . " But sometimes it starts to work on you mentally when you lose to a team for so long and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to lose  --  but it was just a weird feeling playing them . <p> " And now I feel like this is a new era and a new mentality . It was n't a true rivalry before when one team always beat up on the other one . Now , it 's a rivalry . Hopefully , we 've instilled in a lot teams in the NFC East that this is just not a game you can automatically call a win on your schedule anymore . That 's over . We draw the line . " <p> It is rare for expectations to be so high for both Dallas and Washington . This is the first time since 1997 , and just the third time in the 20 years , that the Cowboys and Redskins are both coming off seasons of nine wins or more . The Redskins won three titles in Coach Joe Gibbs 's first stint with the team from 1981 to ' 92 , then finished with more than eight wins only three times between 1993 to 2005 . Dallas was below .500 from 1986 to ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1995 , and by 1999 was in another funk . <p> " This is a great rivalry even when both teams are not playing great , " said Troy Aikman , the Cowboys ' Hall of Fame quarterback from 1989 to 2000 and now an analyst for Fox Sports . " But there 's no question that it only intensifies when those games are really being played for something . I look back towards the end of my career , and the more heated rivalries we had were with San Francisco and Green Bay and some of those teams we kept meeting in the playoffs while the Redskins were struggling . <p> " But there 's no question that with these two teams now , with how much is expected of them and for them both to be 0-1 , that makes it a big game . There has to be a tremendous sense of urgency and pressure from both teams to win this game . " <p> Both teams blew leads last week and looked disjointed . <p> " Dallas is in the same situation we 're in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to go into the season 0-2 . We both gave away a game , and now our backs are against the wall . " <p> Bledsoe joked about the doomsday mentality gripping Washington and Dallas last week  --  " The sky is falling , the world is coming to an end , that whole thing "  --  then turned serious and conceded the " meaningfulness " of tomorrow 's game . That neither team shined in the preseason has exacerbated the angst . <p> " If the preseason went smoothly for both these teams , I do n't think there would be as much controversy , " said former Cowboys fullback Daryl Johnston , an NFL analyst who questions the Redskins for not implementing more of their new offensive game plan in the preseason . " I do n't think the fans are pushing the panic button because of last week . It 's really because of what has happened over the last five weeks . " <p> The Cowboys , amid the circus that accompanies Owens , also are dealing with calls for untested backup quarterback Tony Romo to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 24-17 loss at Jacksonville . The Redskins ' offense is still trying to master associate head coach Al Saunders 's challenging new playbook , while Gibbs has grumbled about the difficulties of facing a short work week for the game coming off a Monday night contest . <p> " You could n't have a tougher assignment , " Gibbs said , fearful his team will have as many NFC losses by tonight as it had all of last season . <p> Gibbs 's Redskins went 0-2 in 1984 , yet reached the playoffs . They rebounded from an 0-2 start to finish 10-6 in 1989 , but missed the postseason . Dallas Coach Bill Parcells recalled his teams starting seasons 0-2 and 3-6 and reaching the playoffs . Another defeat by Washington or Dallas would certainly increase the public scrutiny and leave someone chasing the pack in the NFC East , but would not exact a death sentence on the 2006 season . <p> " I go to the racetrack once in a while , and they 've never paid off at the half-mile pole or at the five-eighth-pole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So it 's a little early to be discussing what 's going to be going on in Week 16 right now .
