Photograph // BUCK WHEN HE WAS 15 , BUT THE EXPERIENCE WOULD MAKE A BOY NAMED BRIAN ROBESON FAMOUS . Writers write about things they know . Gary Paulsenauthor of the best-selling Brian Robeson books " Hatchet , " " The River , " " Brian 's Winter " and " Brian 's Return " - has crash-landed in Alaska , been attacked by moose ( on foot , in a pickup , in a canoe , on a sled ) and by mosquitoes that " blinded me , choked me and tore into me like eight or nine thousand starving vampires , " Mr. Paulsen writes in his new book " Guts . " " I 've had bear come at me , been stalked by a mountain lion , been bitten by snakes and punctured by porcupines and torn by foxes and once pecked by an attacking raven .... " And , in this excerpt from " Guts , " pounced on by a deer when he was 15 and bow hunting in a swampy area near his Minnesota home one rainy fall day .... I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounding noise , as if something large had jumped in the air and landed on the swamp grass just ahead of me . And then , half a second later , another one , then another , all coming closer , straight at me . All of this in about two seconds . Automatically , I raised the bow and drew the arrow back , until the back of the three-sided broadhead rested against the belly of the bow just over my hand . All was in slow motion now . I had a fleeting thought that it had been raining hard and that the feathers on my arrow were wet . I wondered how it would affect the flight or accuracy of the shot . Then another bound and the grass in front of me parted , and coming at me , at a full run , was a 12-point buck ( six on each side , counted later ) , and I saw him , not 10 feet away , just as he left the ground , and I released the arrow and saw it disappear into the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already in the air and hit by the arrow when he saw me and he could n't change the direction of his jump but he tried and so instead of hitting me full on , he twisted in the air and hit me with his side as he fell over me . It was like being hit by a truck . I went down , arrows and bow flying . One of his legs tangled in the bowstring , and in the violent kicking to get loose he broke the bow and several arrows that had been tossed out of my quiver as I went over backward . Other than being soaked and covered with mud , I was unharmed . The deer had been hit solidly . The arrow had driven into the center of his chest and slightly up , hitting the heart almost exactly in the middle . After colliding with me , he had continued over in a sideways somersault , bounded to his feet , taken two staggering steps , then settled , rather than fallen , in the grass . Photograph Photograph // I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pieces , string wrapped around my head and the deer kicking his last . I had been told to always test a deer by poking it to make certain it was dead so that it could n't kick you when you leaned over it . But as I rolled to my feet and moved toward the buck , my hunting knife in my hand , I saw that he was truly dead . His eyes were glazed and gone and he was n't breathing . I felt the sadness that comes with killing when you hunt but also the elation that comes with having succeeded-it makes for an odd mixture of emotions . I had taken a very large buck  --  even dressed he was close to 200 pounds . At the time I weighed about 130. 1 was in the middle of a quagmire swamp two miles from the road where I 'd left my bicycle . And then it was four miles back to town . I was to learn , as Brian learned later , that there is sometimes a huge difference between hunting and killing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the deer back to town . I somehow horsed the buck out of the swamp ; it took me well over an hour to go the short distance to higher , more solid ground . Once there I used the bowstring and my belt to rig up a waist harness , which I looped through a hole in the buck 's lower jaw , then around my waist , so that I could drag the dead deer to the highway . I stopped dragging the buck before hard dark and set up camp in some willows . Luckily I was on the edge of another small swamp , and I found some dead birch skirting the grass area . With my knife I cut bark from one of the dead trees and used it for kindling . Then I covered the bark with small pine twigs broken off from the underside of dead limbs that were still relatively dry . I had matches , of course . I would not go out without matches . I had waterproofed them with melted wax and I carried them in a waterproof case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bark and at length had a sputtering half  --  fire going . I added what partially dry wood I could find under trees , stacked more wet wood on top and soon had a good-sized blaze crackling away , which did much to bring my spirits up . Of course I was starving , but I had plenty of meat . I cut strips of rib meat off the buck and cooked them , tallow and all , draped over the fire on green sticks ( green so that they would not burn ) , and ate them when they were just short of burnt . They tasted-without salt or pepper or bread-incredibly fine and I must have eaten four or five pounds of meat before I was at last full , my mouth and tongue caked with venison tallow . Then I gathered all the wood I could find by firelight , until I had enough for several nights . I lay near the fire , dozing and adding wood all night . Photograph // The wolves came not too long after midnight , brought by the smell of blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firelight , and for a few moments I was afraid and missed my bow terribly , but the fire kept them well away . They probably would not have bothered me , but I still had some broadheads , which I determined to use as hand spears if necessary . This comforted me . The wolves left well before first light , and when it was bright enough to see I went to work on the carcass . I skinned part of it down the side and used the raw skin to make a better harness than just the belt around my waist . After a meal of cooked rib meat and peaty-tasting water from the spring nearby , I set off dragging again . I dragged until I could n't stand it any longer , until every muscle in my body was on fire . Then I tried to haul the carcass in an over-the-shoulder fireman carry , but I only made about 50 yards before my legs buckled , so I stopped and took a break , building another fire and cooking some more rib meat . It actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best solution was just to stay out in the woods until I had cooked and eaten the whole deer . So I had to get back , and I worked all that day , dragging and stopping , and finally , completely exhausted , I arrived at the road just short of dark . By then most of the hair was gone off one side of the carcass . My bicycle was still there and I lugged and pulled at the carcass until it was across the seat and the handlebars and started pushing it down the road . It was nearly impossible-the carcass kept falling off to one side or the other-but the wheels made it infinitely better than dragging . After a few hundred feet I worked out a balance point and it became slightly less difficult . Photograph // It was an almost-deserted back road but there were some farms out along the edge of the forest and I thought , or dreamed , or hoped and prayed , that somebody , anybody , would come along in a truck and give me a lift to town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road at about a mile an hour , stopping often to rub my legs , more often to get the deer back on the bike . It was well after midnight when I pulled into the driveway of the apartment . I found some rope and pulled the deer carcass-rubbed and torn , half-skinned , ragged but still there-up on one of the rafters in the old garage near the apartment until it hung with its back feet just touching the floor . Then I went down into the basement , where I slept on an old oversized armchair arrangement . Listening to the hiss of the coal burning in the furnace , I fell into a sleep as sound as a dead man 's . And my life moved on and there were other hunts , some better , some worse , and other deer and small game , and I did not really think of this buck again until it was time to write " Hatchet " and " Brian 's Winter , " when the buck became part of Brian 's life as well as mine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRIAN BOOKS by Gary Paulsen . <p>
