1 The most desirable women in Las Vegas did nt live there . They lived in southern California and worked as dental hygienists , aerobic instructors , and nurses . They lived regular , nine-to-five lives . Then , on the weekend , they flew to Las Vegasusually on Southwest , because it had the most flightsgot off the plane , and became different people . Their names changed , and so did their hairstyles and their clothes . It was as if a magic wand had been waved over them , although the change was anything but magical . They became strippers in the gentlemens clubs that hung on the periphery of the Las Vegas Strip . They paid the club owners two hundred bucks a night and made the money back in twenty minutes from drunken men wanting a friction dance . On a good night , they took home a grand . It wasnt that these women were more beautiful than the women who lived in Las Vegas . Vegas was filled with knockouts . What made them different was that they werent used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Vegas got treated . No , these women still had dreams . They lived in la-la land , and it came through on their faces every time they smiled . Her name was Kris , and she danced at the Pink Pony . Lieutenant Pete Longo of the Metro Las Vegas Police Department had met Kris while responding to a call about a fight . Normally , he would have let a uniform deal with it , only the prospect of seeing naked women dancing against a backdrop of sporting events projected on a colossal screen had propelled him into action . That , and not having to see his wife for another hour . The fight was between a drunk and a bouncer , and it was over Kris . The drunk was a big , corn-fed kid from the Midwest whod trapped Kris in a VIP booth . She was naked save a G-string and looked scared out of her wits . Petite , blond hair , great figure , and her own breasts . Not the prettiest woman hed ever seen , but damn close . Longo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to arrest the drunk . The drunk had responded by spitting on him . Longo was pretty fat . His mother called him chubby , but that was his mother . Beneath the flab was some real muscle . In the gym , he could bench-press his weight . Most guys his size couldnt do that . And he knew how to fight . He knocked the drunk out with two punches . It had impressed the hell out of the bouncer , an African American kid whose Italian suit had gotten torn in the scuffle . And it had impressed the gaggle of patrons and strippers standing nearby . But who it impressed the most was Kris . Ohhh , shed squealed as the Midwest Mauler fell . Longo made the bouncer sit on him . Then hed taken off his jacket and draped it over Kriss shoulders . You okay ? he asked . She closed the jacket around her and nodded her head . Did he hurt you ? She shook her head . That was really cool , she said . Whats your name ? Starr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten her . The hint of a smile crossed her lips . Kris . Youre not from around here , are you ? he said . That had been six weeks ago . Pulling into the driveway of Kriss townhouse in his brand-new Ford Explorer , Longo found himself shaking his head . It felt like theyd known each other six years . Every time theyd gotten togetherevery single encounterhad been the stuff dreams were made of . Beeping his horn , he looked expectantly at the front door . A minute passed . He rolled down his window and sucked in the brisk desert air . It was early April , his favorite time of year . Warm days , cool nights ; perfect sleeping weather . He tapped his horn again . When she did nt come out , he slipped out of the SUV . The garage door was open , his old Mustang convertible sitting in the space . Hed given it to Kris so shed have wheels on the weekends . Hed concocted an elaborate story for his wife , only shed never asked him what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Ford Explorer , he guessed . Cindi was funny that way . Since their marriage had gone on the rocks , she had stopped questioning where the money was coming from . They went on nice vacations twice a year , drove new cars , and had money in the bank . All on his crummy detectives salary . The front door was locked , and he trudged around back . Taking the spare key out of the flowerpot , he unlocked the back door . He waited expectantly for the alarms piercing whine . When it did nt sound , he went in . Hey , Kris , its me . They stop serving breakfast at nine . We need to hurry . Still no answer . Probably in the bathroom , doing her hair . Kris looked like a cheerleader when she wasnt stripping . She was a stickler about keeping the place clean , and he slipped off his shoes and padded silently into the living room . Right away he knew something was wrong . The air smelled funny , and he spied a half-smoked cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the night before and called him from the club . Said she was going to dance until three am , then go to the townhouse . He was to pick her up at eight thirty for breakfast . A simple plan , although he now realized that someone had come home with her . Lifting his eyes , he stared at the hallway that led to her bedroom . Were they in there , sound asleep ? He took a deep breath . Being a cop twenty years , hed come to know the seven deadly sins pretty well . Betrayal was the worst . It shattered everything you held to be true , and was as damaging as a bullet to the flesh . He cracked her bedroom door and peeked inside . Kris lay beneath a leopard-skin blanket , eyes shut , her wheat-gold hair displayed luxuriously on a pillow . His heartbeat quickened . Every time he saw her , he felt like a high school senior with his life stretched out before him , not some fat , forty-five-year-old bozo with two kids and a wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at the bathroom door . Was her friend with the cigarette in there ? His eyes canvassed the room and spotted Kriss clothes folded neatly on a chair . It was a little ritual she performed whenever they made love . It always made him smile . Kris ? Her eyelids remained shut . He stepped into the room . His instinct told him to check the bathroom first , and his heart told him to check her . His instinct won out , and he kicked the bathroom door open . Empty . He sat on the edge of the bed . It was a motionless water bed , so comfortable that theyd once slept for ten hours straight . He looked down at her . The color was draining from her face , her exquisite features turning hard . Kris ? He did nt want to believe she was gone , his heart winning out over his instincts . He lifted the blanket with the tip of his finger and saw where the bullet had entered her body , and taken her life . Her killer had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he guessed shed died instantly . Lowering the blanket , he rose from the bed , looked at the ceiling , and tried not to sob . Only one thing to do . Get in the Explorer and burn rubber . He couldnt be caught here . He looked down at her a final time . I love you so much , he whispered . Putting his shoes on in the kitchen , Longo stared at a pair of socks sitting on the table . Hed left the socks here last weekend . In typical Kris-fashion , shed washed and folded them . As he picked up the socks , the words Oh , no , escaped his mouth . How many more of his things were in the townhouse ? And what about his fingerprints ? They were probably on every doorknob and light fixture . And Kriss phone bills , the investigating detectives would surely look at those . All trails would lead directly back to him . He pulled a chair out from the table and dropped his massive bulk into it . He was about to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge would not be his friends . They would look at his lifestyle , questioning his expensive vacations and the new cars he bought every year . What was he going to tell them ? That he found a bag of money behind a casino ? Or would he tell them about the departments secret slush fund , and how money was being siphoned from the bank accounts of well-known wise guys . The wise guys werent shouting about it , knowing a bribe when they saw one . He couldnt do that . That would be suicide . He would lie about the money . Jesus Christ , he said aloud . Hed get thrown off the force , and Cindi would surely leave him . His teenage daughters would shun him , and his parents wouldnt be too thrilled , either . His life was about to be ruined . And all because hed gone and fallen in love . Standing , he slid the chair beneath the table . The leg hit something soft , and he looked beneath the table and saw a black gym bag . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several different casinos . He pulled it out and let his fingers run through the chips . Reds , greens , purples , and yellows . There was even a brown chip . You did nt see those very often . He blew his cheeks out . There was twenty grand here , easy . This was worse than bad . He couldnt explain this . And if there was any part of the story the investigators would want explained , it was why twenty grand in casino chips was in Kriss townhouse . Zipping the bag closed , he saw a sliver of paper tucked in a side pocket . He pulled it free . It was an embossed business card , and he stared at the raised lettering .
