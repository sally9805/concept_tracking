A Bolt from the Blue : Sudden Musicophilia // Tony Cicoria was forty-two , very fit and robust , a former college football player who had become a well-regarded orthopedic surgeon in a small city in upstate New York . He was at a lakeside pavilion for a family gathering one fall afternoon . It was pleasant and breezy , but he noticed a few storm clouds in the distance ; it looked like rain . // He went to a pay phone outside the pavilion to make a quick call to his mother ( this was in 1994 , before the age of cell phones ) . He still remembers every single second of what happened next : " I was talking to my mother on the phone . There was a little bit of rain , thunder in the distance . My mother hung up . The phone was a foot away from where I was standing when I got struck . I remember a flash of light coming out of the phone . It hit me in the face . Next thing I remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to hesitate before telling me this  --  " I was flying forwards . Bewildered . I looked around . I saw my own body on the ground . I said to myself , ' Oh shit , I 'm dead . ' I saw people converging on the body . I saw a woman  --  she had been standing waiting to use the phone right behind me  --  position herself over my body , give it CPR . . . . I floated up the stairs  --  my consciousness came with me . I saw my kids , had the realization that they would be okay . Then I was surrounded by a bluish-white light . . . an enormous feeling of well-being and peace . The highest and lowest points of my life raced by me . No emotion associated with these . . . pure thought , pure ecstasy . I had the perception of accelerating , being drawn up . . . there was speed and direction . Then , as I was saying to myself , ' This is the most glorious feeling I have ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Dr. Cicoria knew he was back in his own body because he had pain  --  pain from the burns on his face and his left foot , where the electrical charge had entered and exited his body  --  and , he realized , " only bodies have pain . " He wanted to go back , he wanted to tell the woman to stop giving him CPR , to let him go ; but it was too late  --  he was firmly back among the living . After a minute or two , when he could speak , he said , " It 's okay  --  I 'm a doctor ! " The woman ( she turned out to be an intensive-care-unit nurse ) replied , " A few minutes ago , you weren't. " // The police came and wanted to call an ambulance , but Cicoria refused , delirious . They took him home instead ( " it seemed to take hours " ) , where he called his own doctor , a cardiologist . The cardiologist , when he saw him , thought Cicoria must have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with examination or EKG . " With these things , you 're alive or dead , " the cardiologist remarked . He did not feel that Dr. Cicoria would suffer any further consequences of this bizarre accident . // Cicoria also consulted a neurologist  --  he was feeling sluggish ( most unusual for him ) and having some difficulties with his memory . He found himself forgetting the names of people he knew well . He was examined neurologically , had an EEG and an MRI . Again , nothing seemed amiss . // A couple of weeks later , when his energy returned , Dr. Cicoria went back to work . There were still some lingering memory problems  --  he occasionally forgot the names of rare diseases or surgical procedures  --  but all his surgical skills were unimpaired . In another two weeks , his memory problems disappeared , and that , he thought , was the end of the matter . // What then happened still fills Cicoria with amazement , even now , a dozen years later . Life had returned to normal , seemingly , when " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this insatiable desire to listen to piano music . " This was completely out of keeping with anything in his past . He had had a few piano lessons as a boy , he said , " but no real interest . " He did not have a piano in his house . What music he did listen to tended to be rock music . // With this sudden onset of craving for piano music , he began to buy recordings and became especially enamored of a Vladimir Ashkenazy recording of Chopin favorites  --  the Military Polonaise , the Winter Wind ? tude , the Black Key ? tude , the A-flat Polonaise , the B-flat Minor Scherzo . " I loved them all , " Tony said . " I had the desire to play them . I ordered all the sheet music . At this point , one of our babysitters asked if she could store her piano in our house  --  so now , just when I craved one , a piano arrived , a nice little upright . It suited me fine . I could hardly read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach myself . " It had been more than thirty years since the few piano lessons of his boyhood , and his fingers seemed stiff and awkward . // And then , on the heels of this sudden desire for piano music , Cicoria started to hear music in his head . " The first time , " he said , " it was in a dream . I was in a tux , onstage ; I was playing something I had written . I woke up , startled , and the music was still in my head . I jumped out of bed , started trying to write down as much of it as I could remember . But I hardly knew how to notate what I heard . " This was not too successful  --  he had never tried to write or notate music before . But whenever he sat down at the piano to work on the Chopin , his own music " would come and take me over . It had a very powerful presence . " // I was not quite sure what to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and overwhelm him . Was he having musical hallucinations ? No , Dr. Cicoria said , they were not hallucinations  --  " inspiration " was a more apt word . The music was there , deep inside him  --  or somewhere  --  and all he had to do was let it come to him . " It 's like a frequency , a radio band . If I open myself up , it comes . I want to say , ' It comes from heaven , ' as Mozart said . " // His music is ceaseless . " It never runs dry , " he continued . " If anything , I have to turn it off . " // Now he had to wrestle not just with learning to play the Chopin , but to give form to the music continually running in his head , to try it out on the piano , to get it on manuscript paper . " It was a terrible struggle , " he said . " I would get up at four in the morning and play till I went to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the piano all evening . My wife was not really pleased . I was possessed . " // In the third month after being struck by lightning , then , Cicoria  --  once an easygoing , genial family man , almost indifferent to music  --  was inspired , even possessed , by music , and scarcely had time for anything else . It began to dawn on him that perhaps he had been " saved " for a special reason . " I came to think , " he said , " that the only reason I had been allowed to survive was the music . " I asked him whether he had been a religious man before the lightning . He had been raised Catholic , he said , but had never been particularly observant ; he had some " unorthodox " beliefs , too , such as in reincarnation. // He himself , he grew to think , had had a sort of reincarnation , had been transformed and given a special gift , a mission , to " tune in " to the music that he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This came , often , in " an absolute torrent " of notes with no breaks , no rests , between them , and he would have to give it shape and form . ( As he said this , I thought of Caedmon , the seventh-century Anglo-Saxon poet , an illiterate goatherd who , it was said , had received the " art of song " in a dream one night , and spent the rest of his life praising God and creation in hymns and poems. ) // Cicoria continued to work on his piano playing and his compositions . He got books on notation , and soon realized that he needed a music teacher . He would travel to concerts by his favorite performers but had nothing to do with musical friends in his own town or musical activities there . This was a solitary pursuit , between himself and his muse . // I asked whether he had experienced other changes since the lightning strike  --  a new appreciation of art , perhaps , different taste in reading , new beliefs ? Cicoria said he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had started to read every book he could find about near-death experiences and about lightning strikes . And he had got " a whole library on Tesla , " as well as anything on the terrible and beautiful power of high-voltage electricity . He felt he could sometimes see " auras " of light or energy around people 's bodies  --  he had never seen this before the lightning bolt . // Some years passed , and Cicoria 's new life , his inspiration , never deserted him for a moment . He continued to work full-time as a surgeon , but his heart and mind now centered on music . He got divorced in 2004 , and the same year had a fearful motorcycle accident . He had no memory of this , but his Harley was struck by another vehicle , and he was found in a ditch , unconscious and badly injured , with broken bones , a ruptured spleen , a perforated lung , cardiac contusions , and , despite his helmet , head injuries . In spite of all this , he made a complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither the accident nor his head injury nor his divorce seemed to have made any difference to his passion for playing and composing music . // I have never met another person with a story like Tony Cicoria 's , but I have occasionally had patients with a similar sudden onset of musical or artistic interests  --  including Salimah M. , a research chemist . In her early forties , Salimah started to have brief periods , lasting a minute or less , in which she would get " a strange feeling "  --  sometimes a sense that she was on a beach that she had once known , while at the same time being perfectly conscious of her current surroundings and able to continue a conversation , or drive a car , or do whatever she had been doing . Occasionally these episodes were accompanied by a " sour taste " in the mouth . She noticed these strange occurrences , but did not think of them as having any neurological significance . It was only when she had a grand mal seizure in the summer of 2003 that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which revealed a large tumor in her right temporal lobe . This had been the cause of her strange episodes , which were now realized to be temporal lobe seizures . The tumor , her doctors felt , was malignant ( though it was probably an oligodendroglioma , of relatively low malignancy ) and needed to be removed . Salimah wondered if she had been given a death sentence and was fearful of the operation and its possible consequences ; she and her husband had been told that there might be some " personality changes " following it . But in the event , the surgery went well , most of the tumor was removed , and after a period of convalescence , Salimah was able to return to her work as a chemist . // She had been a fairly reserved woman before the surgery , who would occasionally be annoyed or preoccupied by small things like dust or untidiness ; her husband said she was sometimes " obsessive " about jobs that needed to be done around the house . But now , after the surgery , Salimah seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the idiosyncratic words of her husband ( English was not their first language ) , " a happy cat . " She was , he declared , " a joyologist. " // Salimah 's new cheerfulness was apparent at work . She had worked in the same laboratory for fifteen years and had always been admired for her intelligence and dedication . But now , while losing none of this professional competence , she seemed a much warmer person , keenly sympathetic and interested in the lives and feelings of her co-workers . Where before , in a colleague 's words , she had been " much more into herself , " she now became the confidante and social center of the entire lab. // At home , too , she shed some of her Marie Curie-like , work-oriented personality . She permitted herself time off from her thinking , her equations , and became more interested in going to movies or parties , living it up a bit . And a new love , a new passion , entered her life . She had been " vaguely musical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had played the piano a little , but music had never played any great part in her life . Now it was different . She longed to hear music , to go to concerts , to listen to classical music on the radio or on CDs . She could be moved to rapture or tears by music which had carried " no special feeling " for her before . She became " addicted " to her car radio , which she would listen to while driving to work . A colleague who happened to pass her on the road to the lab said that the music on her radio was " incredibly loud "  --  he could hear it a quarter of a mile away . Salimah , in her convertible , was " entertaining the whole freeway . " // Like Tony Cicoria , Salimah showed a drastic transformation from being only vaguely interested in music to being passionately excited by music and in continual need of it . And with both of them , there were other , more general changes , too  --  a surge of emotionality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released . In Salimah 's words , " What happened after the surgery  --  I felt reborn . That changed my outlook on life and made me appreciate every minute of it . " //
