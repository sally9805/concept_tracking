Chapter One Spider Boy " There are places in the world where people vanish . " His father had said this . His father had spoken flatly , without an air of mystery or threat . It was not a statement to be challenged and it was not a statement to be explained . Later , when his father had vanished out of his life , he would summon back the words as a kind of explanation and in anxious moments he would mis -- hear the words as There are places in the world where people can vanish . Still later , when he had not seen his father in a long time , or what seemed to him a long time , months , or maybe just weeks , he would try to summon the words again , exactly as his father had uttered them , but by this time he 'd become uncertain , anxious . Where people can vanish , or where people vanish ? It was such a crucial distinction ! " Remember your new name . Think before you answer . Not just , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It helps to lick your lips . That will give you time not to make a mistake you ca n't unmake . " Yet not his name but his surname was the issue . For his surname had been so disgraced there had come to be a fascination in its forbidden sound . The elided consonants and vowels , the lift of its finalsyllable , an expression of ( possibly mocking ) surprise like an arched eyebrow . In private , in his secret places , he spoke the forbidden name aloud in mimicry of newscasters who gave to it an air of intrigue and reproach . Sometimes in his bed at night in his new room in his grandparents ' house he pressed his face deeply into the pillow and spoke the forbidden name , each syllable equally and defiantly stressed  --  Szaa ra . He spoke the name until his breath ran out and his lungs ached and through his body raced a half -- pleasurable panic that he would smother . A pillow . Where his mouth was , wet with saliva . Where his teeth gnawed . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but if a pillow is pressed against your face , if you are lying on your back and a pillow is pressed against your face , you could not summon the strength to push it away and save yourself . " YES . We 've moved out of state . " Before even the impeachment hearings his mother had filed for divorce from their father . But before even she 'd filed for divorce she 'd moved them  --  Emily , Philip , herself  --  into her parents ' big stone house overlooking the Hudson River at Nyack , New York . Now it was a drive of several hours to the old house in Trenton , overlooking the Delaware River . On the map , it was really not very far but there was an air of distance and finality in his mother 's frequently repeated words : " Out of state . " Out of state caught in Philip 's mind , uttered in his mother 's breathless yet adamant voice . As you might say out of space , out of time . Out of danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this new state it was essential to have a new name . To replace and nullify the old , disgraced name . Quickly !  --  before Emily and Philip were enrolled in their new schools . " Yes , we think it 's best . Separate schools . " Private day schools . Nyack Academy for Emily , who was fifteen and in her second year of high school , Edgerstoune School for Philip , who would be thirteen in August , and would enter eighth grade . In New Jersey both children had gone to the Pennington Academy , in a northern Trenton suburb . Sometimes their mother drove them to school , sometimes one of their father 's assistants . There was a private bus provided by the school , of the identical bright -- pumpkin hue of public school buses but only one -- third the size . Riding on this bus , they 'd never sat together and acknowledged each other only politely , with diffident smiles . For a few weeks during the impeachment hearings they 'd continued to attend the Pennington Academy , but when criminal charges were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mother had removed them from school . " It has to be done . They ca n't be made to suffer for him . They are only children . " In Nyack , it soon became official : they had a new name . Where Szaara had been , now there was Hudgkins . Where Philip Szaara had been , now there was Philip Hudgkins . Where Emily Szaara had been , now there was Emily Hudgkins . For this was n't a " new " new name , of course . It was their Nyack grandparents ' name which they 'd long known and with which they had , their mother insisted , only happy associations . Their mother would take up again her old , " maiden " name with relief . During the sixteen years of her marriage to the New Jersey politician Roy Szaara she had retained Hudgkins as her middle name , she 'd continued to be known by certain of her women friends , with whom she 'd gone to Bryn Mawr , as Miriam Hudgkins . And so : " It is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . " She smiled bravely . She smiled defiantly . She had had her hair cut and restyled and she had a new way of clasping , at waist level , her shaky left hand in her more forceful right hand , as a practiced tennis player might clasp a racket . " I mean , it is coming home . Where we belong . " " ' SPIDER BOY . ' " You might have thought that " Spider Boy " was in playful reference to the comic strip/movie superhero " - Spider - -  man " but in fact Philip had no interest in Spider -- man as he had no interest in the comics , action films and video games that so captivated other boys . " ' Spider Boy . ' " It was a way of evoking the haunting and powerful presence that existed now entirely in memory . Except for a single memento ( smelly , ugly , of a clumsy size and in no way to be mistaken for something of Philip 's own ) kept in a secret place in his room , Philip might begin to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has vanished without having needed to be told .
