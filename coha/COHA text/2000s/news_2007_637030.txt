<p> MARTA needs show of force <p> While utilizing plainclothes officers may in fact have reduced incidents in some areas , the fact that no one sees uniforms in the stations or on the trains makes riders uneasy ( MARTA : How safe ? " Page 1 , Feb. 9 ) . <p> That no one enforces the rules in stations or on trains ( people solicit , spit , eat , drink , smoke , sit on stairs and play loud music ) gives the impression that MARTA is a fairly lawless environment . <p> Make the uniforms visible . Enforce the rules . You 'll not only see an immediate decrease in serious crime but you will also see the increased ridership MARTA needs to survive . <p> RICH DAVIS , Avondale Estates <p> Georgia Power <p> Focus on nuclear means higher bills <p> Although Georgia Power is hiking our electric bills next month , the worst is yet to come ( " Another electric shock , " Editorial , Feb. 9 ) . As the editorial points out , Georgia Power wants to build two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead of encouraging the utility to adopt cleaner , safer and cheaper energy efficiency and renewable energy alternatives , Public Service Commissioner Chuck Eaton wants to reward Georgia Power 's nuclear program . <p> Georgia lags way behind most other states in developing renewable energy sources and using energy efficiently . Until the public service commissioners stand up for the people of Georgia and require Georgia Power to adopt cleaner , safer and cheaper alternatives to nuclear power , we can expect even higher electric bills in the future . <p> FRANK BOVE , Tucker <p> Ratepayers fleeced again <p> Georgia Public Service Commissioner Chuck Eaton has declared his true allegiance ( " Georgia Power entitled to recover fuel costs , " Equal Time , Feb. 8 ) . <p> In his column , he proposes to " develop a performance-based rate-making plan that would reward Georgia Power " for more efficiency in nuclear power and penalize it for less efficiency . <p> Now , let 's see . We give Georgia Power MORE favorable rates ( than it already has ) ? And where does the money come from for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ratepayers who have been fleeced again by Georgia Power , in cahoots with its friends at the Public Service Commission ! They will get more money if they do better , and they will get more money if they do worse ( that pesky guaranteed profit rate ) . <p> Thanks a lot for " looking out " for us ! <p> GINGER M. MARINE , Ellijay <p> Sidewalks pay off , should be required <p> Mike King is right on the mark when he encourages governments to require sidewalks ( " Sidewalks , schoolwork and slopes , " @issue , Feb. 8 ) . Sidewalks create safer streets , promote physical activity , increase property values , and encourage neighbors to get to know each other . Installing sidewalks when homes or other buildings are constructed is far less expensive than retrofitting streets later . It also shifts the financial burden from taxpayers to developers . <p> DeKalb County has one of Georgia 's best sidewalk ordinances . In the 13-county metro Atlanta region , only six counties currently require developers to install sidewalks in front of all new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counties should require sidewalks now  --  or they 'll foot the bill later . <p> MICHAEL ORTA , Decatur <p> Plan early and plan ahead , for kids ' sake <p> Thank you for your on-target editorial regarding the need for pre-k programs throughout the state 's school systems ( " Pre-k faces a setback , " Editorial , Feb. 9 ) . <p> The earlier that children are made more homogeneous in instructional needs , the less wide will be the instructional span of needs by children in each grade level thereafter . More importantly , fewer students will be lost " through the cracks " of the educational system as they advance through each grade and , as a result , discipline problems will decrease . <p> Yes , Georgia needs more vision in what it is doing in education . " Planning early and planning ahead " is always a good motto , especially with the lives of children . <p> ELIZABETH HARTLEY FILLIAT , Alpharetta <p> Pilots should be able to carry weapons <p> Insisting that trained and certified U.S. pilots be allowed to carry weapons on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airline pilot of 25 years , I can attest that those countries that resist such procedures will likely become the avenue of opportunity for future terrorists . <p> The main objection seems to be what to do with pilots ' weapons while on a layover in a foreign country . The aircraft lock box or the securing of weapons with airport security personnel before leaving the premises can easily solve that issue . What will be required is a strong negotiating stance by the Bush administration that will insist upon international acceptance of U.S. security needs . <p> The details are negotiable , but the strategy is not . <p> BOB PETERSON , Brooks <p> Bad planning bites us in the bumper <p> Somehow , Georgia 's methods of addressing the problem of vehicle traffic have come back to bite us in the bumper ( " Errors blamed for I-20 backup , " Metro , Feb. 8 ) . The nightmare is not the closure of the lane that caused the incredible 14-mile backup during the morning rush hour . It is not even the fact that the snag had Gov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , yet again , we are provided unequivocal evidence that the metro Atlanta area desperately needs transportation alternatives . <p> Banning lane closures during peak morning rush hour does not solve the root problem of getting cars off the roads . If we do not change our policies quickly , with permanent traffic congestion relief through public rail-based transit , we are certain to witness another nightmare like this in the near future . <p> JAIRA J. HARRINGTON <p> Harrington , of Atlanta , is a senior at Spelman College . <p> Teach your parents well  --  about Web <p> Rob Dahm is quite right ( " Do n't intrude into Web life , " @issue , Feb. 9 ) . In theory , parents should be the best " police " for responsible behavior on the Internet . However , while most adults are familiar with non-Internet issues that affect teens , it is quite a different story when it comes to technology and the Internet . <p> The Internet is an area where parents are digital immigrants and the teens are digital natives . When it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education . It truly is a full-time job keeping up with online sites and trends . Sure , most parents have heard of MySpace and YouTube ; however , there are hundreds of similar and complementary sites . <p> Ask the average parent if they have heard of sites like Flickr , PhotoBucket , Meebo , Second Life , MyYearBook or CollegeHumor . And that 's just the short list . Most likely you will be greeted with a blank stare . <p> So kids , start educating your parents . <p> KEN LEEBOW , Marietta Photo : PAUL DONSKY / StaffMARTA 's safety was questioned after a jury awarded $1.7 million to a woman who was raped after an abduction on transit property. /ImageData* ImageData* Photo : ANDY SHARP / StaffA sidewalk and a sign indicating crosswalk instructions/ImageData*
