<p> Here is a sampling of outdoors-related copy from the Intermountain region and around the nation : <p> Chances are wild <p> By ERIC BARKER Lewiston Morning Tribune <p> LEWISTON , Idaho ( AP ) - Nearly three quarters of the more than 200,000 steelhead that have returned above Lower Granite Dam this year are hatchery-bred fish . <p> But about 40 percent of fish caught by anglers have been wild . <p> That statistic has anglers scratching their heads and wondering , what gives ? <p> Outfitter Don Vogel of Lewiston does n't keep a precise log , but guesses just under half the fish caught by his clients have been keepers . <p> Stu Waters of the Waters Edge tackle shop at Clarkston says between half and 60 percent of the fish he catches ca n't be kept because they have intact adipose fins . <p> Another Clarkston angler , who does n't want to broadcast his success by having his name in the paper , reports of the 165 fish brought to his boat this fall , 102 have been hatchery steelhead and 63 wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 38 percent wild . <p> " It 's two times higher than it should be , " he says . " At least two times . " <p> According to preliminary statistics from Idaho Department of Fish and Game steelhead angler surveys , 67 percent of the steelhead caught on the Clearwater River have been hatchery fish and 33 percent wild . <p> On the Snake , a whopping 42 percent of the steelhead caught have been wild , compared to 58 percent hatchery . <p> But of the 204,000 steelhead over lower Granite Dam , 53,000 to 54,000 have been wild . That 's about 25 percent . <p> Theories that might explain this phenomenon are debated over cups of Joe at coffee shops , happy hour beers at the bar and while leaning against tailgates and gunwales at boat ramps . Some of them are even discussed at Fish and Game offices . <p> There are those who think hatcheries are doing an inadequate job of clipping adipose fins . <p> Others believe a Nez Perce Tribe fisheries program to boost wild numbers is skewing the catch ratio . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River system is on the rise , and that could be part of the explanation . <p> Ed Schriever , regional fisheries manager for the Idaho Department of Fish and Game at Lewiston , has his own idea . He calls it the jellybean theory . <p> Say you have a jar of 200,000 jellybeans and 25 percent of them are licorice and 75 percent of them are watermelon . <p> The jellybean harvest rules say you can keep and eat watermelon jellybeans , but the licorice ones have to be returned to the jar . <p> So each time you thrust your hand into the jar and come up with a fistful of jellybeans , the black ones are thrown back and the green and red ones go into your mouth . The more times you dip into the jar , the higher the ratio becomes of black jellybeans to red and green jellybeans . <p> That is what is happening with wild fish , according to Schriever . They ca n't be kept but the hatchery fish can be . So as the fishing season wears on , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish to the river . <p> Larry Barrett , a fisheries biologist at the department , has a similar theory . He says many of the wild fish , since they ca n't be kept , are being caught more than once , thus boosting the number of wild fish that show up in angler surveys . <p> The two theories might account for some of the reason anglers are catching a disproportionate number of licorice steelhead . <p> However , it is also true that many steelhead anglers release hatchery steelhead , because they catch far more than they want or can legally keep . That means many of the hatchery steelhead are also recycled . <p> The jellybean theory can be expanded to encompass the so-called stubby steelhead . <p> That would go like this : Jellybean managers want more licorice jellybeans , so they dye some of the red and green ones black . So , many of the black jellybeans are not really licorice , even though they appear to be . <p> In 1999 the states of Oregon , Washington and Idaho reached an agreement with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to reduce the catch of B-run steelhead in the Zone 6 Columbia River tribal fishery . <p> In exchange for reducing the take of wild B-run steelhead , the tribe is releasing some of the mitigation hatchery steelhead without having their adipose fins clipped . <p> Under the agreement , about 10 percent of the 10 million to 11 million juvenile hatchery steelhead released in the Snake River system are released without having their fins clipped . Those fish are being used to help supplement wild runs of steelhead . <p> The idea is to leave the fins intact so the fish escape the 60 percent sport harvest of hatchery steelhead and have a chance to spawn in the wild . <p> However , the actual number of hatchery steelhead devoted to supplementation , sometimes called stubbies , would not account for such a disproportionate catch rate , according to Barrett . <p> He says about 15,000 of the more than 200,000 steelhead that have crossed Lower Granite Dam are supplementation steelhead . <p> These steelhead can often be identified as supplementation fish because their dorsal fins are worn down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fins are intact . Even though they began life in the hatchery , these fish can not be kept by anglers . <p> David Johnson of the Nez Perce Tribe says even though some of the hatchery steelhead raised to mitigate for Dworshak and Hells Canyon dams are released without having their fins clipped , the large returns of the past two years mean there are actually more keepable steelhead in the river than there have been in many years . <p> " There is still an abundance of fish , " says Johnson . " Way more fish are available for the recreational fisherman to fish for than there has been in previous years . We are encouraging people to catch the heck out of them . " <p> Another theory is the differences in behavior between hatchery and wild steelhead . <p> Many people believe the wild steelhead move into the flowing sections of the Snake and Clearwater rivers sooner , and the hatchery steelhead tend to spend more time in the reservoirs . <p> " Wild fish tend to come in a little sooner . There could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't in the Clearwater , so there could be a difference of abundance in the river just based on behavior . We know a lot of Dworshak hatchery B 's tend to over- winter in the reservoir . " <p> Ginkgo biloba may help skiers , climbers avoid altitude sickness <p> By JANET RAE BROOKS The Salt Lake Tribune <p> SALT LAKE CITY ( AP ) - This spring , 100 test subjects are scheduled to be driven up the slopes of Hawaii 's Mauna Kea volcano to try to pin down whether an inexpensive herbal extract can protect climbers , skiers and other outdoor enthusiasts from the debilitating effects of high altitude . <p> Ginkgo biloba , an extract of the leaf of the ginkgo biloba tree , seemed like the answer to mountaineers ' prayers after a 1996 French study showed it provided remarkable protection against altitude sickness for climbers on a Himalayan expedition . <p> Two U.S. researchers , inspired to study gingko after reading the French study , have not duplicated the startling results , but are intrigued enough to continue investigating . <p> In the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who all had experienced altitude sickness on previous expeditions , into two groups . One group received 160 milligrams of ginkgo extract daily while slowly climbing to a base camp of 14,700 feet and making further ascents to various altitudes . The other group took a placebo . <p> Only 14 percent of the climbers who took ginkgo experienced one or more symptoms of altitude sickness , compared to 82 percent in the placebo group . None of the ginkgo group developed the full symptoms of acute mountain sickness , while 41 percent of those taking placebo did . <p> The ginkgo group , which happened to contain two smokers and three ex-smokers , also had fewer cold-related vascular problems . There were no smokers or ex-smokers in the placebo group . <p> When Janet Onopa of the University of Hawaii told a class of first-year medical students that the findings of the extraordinary French study - which no one was using - could easily be replicated in Hawaii , a student volunteered to help do just that . <p> " I 'm a climber , " he told Onopa after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work my butt off on it , if you are willing to do it . " <p> Onopa , the student and others studied whether ginkgo would help during rapid ascent . Their subjects started taking ginkgo a day before they were driven from sea level to the 13,796-foot summit of Mauna Kea . In the ginkgo group , just 17 percent developed acute mountain sickness , while 64 percent of the placebo group did . But the small number of subjects - a total of 26 in both groups - prevented the researchers from drawing definitive conclusions . <p> The climbing student has been testing the use of gingko in a study in Nepal , but the results do n't look as promising , Onopa said . <p> " Research is like that , " she said . Ginkgo , commonly prescribed by homeopaths as a treatment for Alzheimer 's disease , may still be an altitude panacea , " but until we get large numbers , we just do n't know . It will take another 50 years to sort it out because it 's a complicated compound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the spring on Mauna Kea with 100 subjects , will compare the use of ginkgo to the sulfonamide drug acetazolamide , marketed as Diamox , which is used to accelerate acclimatization . <p> Meanwhile , Onopa has no hesitation in using ginkgo herself . " Its side-effect profile is very benign and it 's very inexpensive , " she said . <p> Those taking aspirin and blood thinners should avoid taking ginkgo , as it is thought that ginkgo could induce internal bleeding , although bleeding has not occurred in trials . <p> Peter Hackett , president of the International Society for Mountain Medicine , also began studying ginkgo after reading the French study . <p> " I read it and I could n't believe it , " said Hackett , who is based in Ridgeway , Colo . " I had to do my own study . " <p> Hackett had subjects take ginkgo five days before a quick ascent of 14,110-foot Pike 's Peak . Those in the ginkgo group were half as likely to experience acute mountain sickness as those taking placebo . But in September , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three days before ascent , to low-dose acetazolamide , the drug prevented acute mountain sickness , but ginkgo did not . <p> " That 's science for you , " said Hackett , who is now designing a third study . He also believes larger studies are needed to nail down ginkgo 's effectiveness . <p> Hackett still advises climbers who consult him to try ginkgo . <p> " Clearly it helps some people and it 's safe , " said Hackett , who included information on ginkgo while lecturing at the Special Operations Medical Association conference in Tampa , Fla . " It does n't have as many side effects as Diamox . Since it 's not harmful , and there are studies showing it works for some people , it 's worth a try . " <p> Many climbers who consult him write back to laud ginkgo , Hackett said . <p> For those sleeping at 8,000 feet or higher , or known to be particularly susceptible to altitude sickness , Hackett advises taking 100 mg of ginkgo twice daily , beginning five days before ascent . <p> Hikers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Times-News <p> TWIN FALLS , Idaho ( AP ) - For the avid hiker , the winter months can sweep in and settle like fog at a drive-in movie . <p> As the flakes fall , boots drop with a heavy thud at the back of the closet and the TV comes on . <p> Many think of the wintery veneer as foreboding and , at best , unpleasant . They can only imagine themselves convulsing in hypothermic shivers should they venture out into the wilds , trudging through the knee-deep snow . So , they muffle the call to head outdoors , drown it out with the hum and glow of their modern appliances . <p> But , millennia ago , necessity drove the invention of the snowshoe . And more and more people are finding that this once-primitive form of travel can break through the barrier of winter , providing a season full of fun and discovery . Deep snows in the mountains and hills can ward off even the sturdiest ill-shod hiker , but with a good pair of snowshoes , virtually no terrain is impassable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falls , takes friends or family out to the South Hills nearly every weekend for a snowshoeing trek . <p> Goodman has been skiing for 26 years and has snowboarded for three , but he says he finds snowshoeing almost as fun . <p> " It 's relatively cheap and you get to see a lot of country you would n't otherwise see , " he said . <p> Snowshoeing offers a good workout and a lot of fun for a price that seems cheap compared to most other winter sports . <p> A good pair of snowshoes cost anywhere from $150 to $260 and up - but you do n't have to buy a lift-ticket . You just haul your shoes out to a snow-covered wilderness , strap them on and go . <p> When choosing snowshoes , go for quality if you 're going to be serious about the sport , Goodman said . There are a lot of cheaper models that wo n't hold up under the stress of multiple outings . <p> " Be honest about your weight , " Goodman said . <p> Snowshoes are designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit , you may find yourself post-holing to your hip in the snow . That gets old fast . Remember to compensate for any load you might be carrying - backpack , food , a tired child - when selecting a snowshoe . <p> Traction is important with snowshoes , especially if you will encounter ice on your trek , Goodman said . When you choose your snowshoe , check that it has an adequate cleat on the bottom . <p> Goodman recommends using ski-poles for stability . He uses adjustable trekking poles fitted with a basket on the end for use in the snow . <p> As with any winter sport , dress in warm layers and choose comfortable boots <p> " Your boots are important to keep you warm and to keep you dry , " Goodman said . <p> He also recommended gaiters to protect snow from entering your pants should you ever find yourself knee-deep in the snow - which you will , every now and again . <p> Once you have your gear you can head out to virtually any wilderness area for a good snowshoeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrain and you want a place with a lot of snow . Goodman is partial to the South Hills . He uses the Wahlstrom Hollow trail almost exclusively . He also recommends the East Fork drainage in the Sawtooths near Hailey for an extended trip . <p> Its an easy sport to start and the whole family can join in the adventure . <p> " My kids do it with me . My wife goes . My dad 's 65 and he goes with me , " Goodman said . <p> END <p>
