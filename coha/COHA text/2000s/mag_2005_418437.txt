Companies want to legislate user agreements-and that 's bad news for you . Photograph ANNE KANDRA // WOULD YOU BUY a toaster if there was a chance it might not work properly when you got it home ? Well , probably . After all , anyone could end up with a dud . But what if the toaster 's maker-let 's call it Toastersoft-denied any responsibility for the product 's problems , defects , or hazards , even if it knew they existed ? Suppose Toastersoft asked you to promise not to try to fix the toaster on your own , instead offering to sell you advice at $35 a pop . Your contract also stipulated that once you bought it , the toaster could not be sold , lent , or given away to anyone , nor could you complain publicly about any problems . Plus , Toastersoft might have conveniently neglected to disclose these rules until after making sure you 'd paid for-and could n't return-the item . Would you do business with anyone under those terms ? You probably already have : That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software companies include all of these provisions in one end-user license agreement ( EULA ) , each condition of sale or use has appeared in some kind of software license . Simply by installing a new piece of software , you could be agreeing to many of these stipulations . In the case of freeware and shareware , in particular , installing the program may mean installing a piece of adware or spyware-a compelling reason to read the EULA . Granted , it 's unlikely that some software company is going to sue you for tinkering with its code or griping to a coworker about its product . But if instaDing the software obligates you not to do these things , do n't you want to know about it ? That 's why it 's important to understand what 's in those EULAs we accept-and to let companies know if we do n't like their terms . All the while , a battle rages behind the scenes : The software industry is pushing legislation to freeze your rights , and consumers are fighting back to reform the license agreement situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , they spell them out in mindnumbing detail in their EULAs-those 46 screens of solid gray text you scroll through to reach the " I Agree " button . EUIAs vary considerably from company to company and from product to product . According to Microsoft 's Windows XP EUIA , for example , the company is n't responsible if the software wreaks havoc with your PC , even if Microsoft knew in advance about the problems . And Autodesk 's EULA for its AutoCAD program says that if you file for bankruptcy , you lose your license to the software . You do read your agreements , do n't you ? Sure you do . Right after you visit the courthouse to volunteer for jury duty and finish brushing your dog 's teeth . The problem is n't just that the devilish details are buried in lines and lines of impenetrable legalese . Sometimes you ca n't even see the EULA until after you have opened the shrink-wrapped box and nearly finished installing the software . COMPANIES ' FREE-FOR-ALL HOW DO VENDORS get away with setting such skewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation designed to govern transactions on digital products does n't yet exist , vendors call the shots . And the software industry wants things to stay that way . In 2000 , the proposed Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act was introduced ( find.pcworld. com/47742 ) . Backed almost exclusively by software companies ( including Microsoft and AOL ) and industry groups , UCITA attempts to establish a national standard for the contracts used in the sale of digital information . Its proponents argue that it will keep costs down for consumers . One UCITA opponent , Ed Foster of Gripelog , a consumer advocacy site ( at find.pcworld.com/47748 ) , sardonically describes the bill as a " freedom of contract " : Basically , the software vendors can get away with whatever they want , as long as they mention it in the EULA . UCITA has been opposed by at least 32 state attorneys general , the Federal Trade Commission , and virtually every consumer advocacy group that has studied it . It has even spawned several anti-UCITA organizations , including Americans for Fair Electronic Commerce Transactions ( AFFECT , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UCITA model have passed in only two states-Maryland and Virginia-and few lawmakers expect it to be enacted elsewhere anytime soon . Most experts consider UCITA to be all but dead , but it could be a sleeping giant . Miriam Nisbet , legislative counsel for the American Library Association and president of AFFECT , explains , " All it would take is for someone , perhaps with a vested interest in the software industry , to present it again , arguing that legislation covering digital products is long overdue . " THINK BEFORE YOU CLICK HOW CAN YOU protect your rights when buying software ? Start by being informed . AFFECT has launched a campaign called Stop Before You Click ( www.fairterms. org ) . The program promotes what it calls the 12 Principles for Fair Commerce in Software and Other Digital Products ( find.pcworld.com/47744 ) . Ultimately , AFFECT 'S goal is not only to raise consumer awareness of unfair user terms , but also to help develop better laws . So to avoid the pitfalls that EULAs present , before you buy a given product , try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies ' Web sites and read the associated EULAs , if available ( Adobe and Symantec , for example , post EULAs prominently on their sites ) . Also , once you have the product in hand , you must read those license agreements closely . For instance , look for an " automatic renewal " clause : You sign up to try out a piece of software , and the next thing you know , you 're being billed regularly for it-a provision that was buried in the agreement . If you 'd rather disable your spam filter for a week than slog through an entire EULA , try to target the most important points , as outlined in AFFECT 'S 12 Principles . Also , the Electronic Frontier Foundation 's Web site ( find.pcworld.com/ 47746 ) includes a guide to dangerous terms found in EULAs . Sites like Bad Software ( find.pcworld.com/47750 ) and Ed Foster 's above-mentioned Gripelog offer EULA reviews and forums , legal analysis , and legislative updates , as well as opportunities to get involved and help others understand EULA issues .

After all , you can return a flaky toaster without any major hassles-why not flaky software ? Sidebar Vendors can get away with whatever they want , as long as it 's in the license .
