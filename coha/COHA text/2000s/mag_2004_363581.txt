The latest smart phones running Microsoft and Palm operating systems are getting some fresh competition from Nokia , the leading handsetmaker . Smaller than a handheld computer but bigger than an ordinary cell phone , the new 6620 will let you check your e-mail , send digital photos , and access the Web over a GSM data network from AT &T; that is capable of speeds of up to 100 kbps , about twice as fast as some other Web-enabled phones . Bundled applications include the Real One video player and MightyPhone synching software for keeping your contacts and appointments up-to-date . The phone also supports more than 70 business applications designed for the Symbian operating system used on the 6620 . Pricing will be set in March when the handset goes on sale .  --  By Anita Hamilton
