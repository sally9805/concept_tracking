<p> The de Young in the 21st Century <p> A Museum by Herzog &; <p> de Meuron <p> By Diana Ketcham <p> THAMES &; HUDSON ; 240 PAGES ; $75 HARDCOVER ; $29.95 PAPERBACK <p> As surely as new museums open these days , they 're accompanied by solemn coffee-table tomes  --  but this one 's worth a look for the smart way it uses the controversial remaking of the M.H. de Young Museum as a means to explore the complicated cultural tensions of contemporary San Francisco . There 's an excellent piece by Michael Corbett on the tangled architectural history of the old de Young and its endless additions and deletions , followed by a passionate Mitchell Schwarzer essay on the upheaval caused by placing a bold museum in a city that has made a fetish of " ongoing criticism that often proved deadly to that process of creation . " Toss in first-rate interviews with the architectural team and a well-told saga of the project 's architectural evolution by Diana Ketchum , and the result captures the reality that when people feel protective about where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Structure and Design <p> By Matthew Wells YALE UNIVERSITY PRESS ; 192 PAGES ; $45 <p> With books about skyscrapers popping up as often as new proposals for the world 's tallest tower , this one stands out for the detailed way it studies  --  not just ogles  --  the objects of affection . Besides the fashion show of shapely silhouettes , we get building diagrams , explanations of energy conservation techniques and descriptions of the engineering innovations that make extreme verticality increasingly feasible . There are also such surprises as the Colorium , a 17-story tower in Dusseldorf by Alsop Architects that sets itself apart using a high-tech version of silk-screening to create a Mondrian-esque facade with 30 colors . Yes , there is life beyond glass and steel . <p> Stanley Saitowitz <p> Buildings and Projects <p> By Stanley Saitowitz / Natoma Architects <p> MONACELLI PRESS ; 320 PAGES ; $60 <p> This uncommonly intelligent monograph explores the recent architecture of one of San Francisco 's most accomplished designers . Saitowitz is best known locally for his Yerba Buena Lofts , a nine-story composition even he likens to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranges from a Holocaust memorial in Boston with its six glass columns to a curvaceous skateboard park in Louisville and a residential tower proposed for downtown San Jose where a pair of two-story courtyards would be carved into each side of the tower . What makes the monograph so rewarding  --  and surprising  --  is how this master of right-angled concrete describes his work as " more akin ... to frames than pictures " : " I want to make buildings as ephemeral as pixels , as delicate as plasma , as discreet as air . " <p> New Museums <p> Contemporary Museum Architecture Around <p> the World <p> By Mimi Zeiger <p> UNIVERSE ; 208 PAGES , $29.95 <p> So you think the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum is a tad stark ? Hey , check out the competition . This survey of 30 recent museum projects shows us a world where concrete and zinc are far more popular than granite or marble , and austere diffidence is the order of the day ( with the baffling exception of Austria 's bladder-shaped Kunsthaus Graz wrapped in blue Plexiglas , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who lives in San Francisco , sees the de Young as a museum that " continues a tradition of artificial nature " and " strikes a careful balance between its natural and architectural environment . " <p> Proceed and Be Bold <p> Rural Studio After <p> Samuel Mockbee <p> By Andrea Oppenheimer Dean and Timothy Hursley <p> PRINCETON ARCHITECTURAL PRESS ; 176 PAGES ; $30 <p> In an age when " important " architecture means big-budget projects by celebrity designers , the saga of Rural Studio is a joy . Samuel Mockbee started the program in 1992 so architecture students at Auburn University could learn their craft by working with poor residents of Hale County , Ala .. After his death from leukemia in 2001 there were fears the studio would fade away , but instead it has flourished as a vibrant tribute to his memory . This elegantly written and vividly photographed book looks at 17 recent projects , from a house with walls made of carpet remnants to a long-shuttered brick building reborn as a gracious senior center . Architectural quality varies , but each project shows how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives better as a result . <p> The Mythic City <p> Photographs of New York by Samuel H. Gottscho , 1925-1940 <p> By Donald Albrecht <p> PRINCETON ARCHITECTURAL PRESS ; 224 PAGES ; $40 <p> Strictly speaking , this deals with photography rather than architecture  --  but it 's hard to imagine any other volume that conjures up so well the glamorous essence of 1930s Manhattan : the skyline , the bridges , the Art Deco storefronts and the impossibly sleek residential hotels . Gottscho was a commercial photographer hired to show buildings and settings in their most favorable light . Nonetheless , these photographs selected from the archives of the Museum of the City of New York make the seductive case that life must have been better in black and white , at least in America 's biggest city at the peak of its allure . <p> Design for Life <p> The Architecture <p> of Sim Van der Ryn <p> By Sim Van der Ryn <p> GIBBS-SMITH , 184 PAGES $39.95 <p> Long before " living roofs " and " green design " were attention-getting buzzwords , Sim Van der @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land . Now the Inverness architect who in the 1970s was Gov . Jerry Brown 's state architect has fused his life story and professional history into an ambitious volume about his quest for " built form that points towards a more ecological world , physically and spiritually . " A proud child of the ' 60s who happily recalls " spending ten days , eight hours a day , listening to my brain waves , " Van der Ryn still deserves attention from jaded peers for his insistence that architecture must evolve in response to larger societal concerns . <p> Frank Lloyd Wright <p> The Houses <p> Photography by Alan Weintraub ; principal text by Alan Hess <p> RIZZOLI ; 544 PAGES ; $75 <p> For devotees convinced that the world needs yet another book about Frank Lloyd Wright , this coffee-table extravaganza is a sumptuous treat . The pictures by Alan Weintraub capture the lively drama of brickwork , stained glass and jutting eaves that characterized the Prairie Style mastery of the architect 's early years , as well as the sculptural drama of the later decades when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's also a welcome substance to the text : Alan Hess tells the story of Wright 's personal and architectural life without fawning , while such respected critics as Thomas Hines and Kenneth Frampton bring their own insights to what drove Wright at different stages of his career . <p> The U.N . Building <p> Essay by Aaron Betsky , photographs by Ben Murphy <p> THAMES &; HUDSON ; 160 PAGES ; $40 <p> Here 's nostalgia of a much different sort than " Mythic City "  --  the crystalline forms of the U.N . complex in New York City , where the ambitious architecture promised a rational new world . <p> The introductory essay by Aaron Betsky captures the " cold bureaucratic majesty " of a complex that once evoked the promise of modern government but now seems " worn and slightly quaint . " And Ben Murphy 's new photographs of the soon-to-be renovated interior add an extra dimension  --  focusing on green marble podiums and crisp leather couches , pale wood panels and other gestures that embody the optimistic gravitas of a too-short era when , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better by a shared purpose spanning the globe .
