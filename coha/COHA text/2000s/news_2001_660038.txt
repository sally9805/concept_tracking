<p> They 're calling it " People Power II . " But compared to the democratic uprising of the Filipino people 15 years ago , the sequel was faster , smarter , and smoother . Facing corruption charges , a stubborn President Joseph Estrada was forced to leave Malacanang palace in only a matter of weeks , making way for Gloria Macapagal Arroyo , who became the 14th president of the Philippines on Saturday . The last time Filipinos cast out a leader roundly deemed corrupt , they first spent 21 years under Ferdinand Marcos 's rule - including 14 under martial law - and suffered through a dark , violent chapter in their crusade to see Mr. Marcos driven from office . But this uprising seemed to run on a different sort of voltage - one with the force of instant information technology , and one that showed an unprecedentedly insistent demand for responsible leadership . While other nations in Southeast Asia , such as Indonesia , saw a similar populist transfer of power marred by bloodshed , the dramatic changing of the guard in Manila this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of democratic progress . " The revolution is not over , " says Alexander Magno , transition spokesman for President Arroyo , who was hailed at an emotional " thanksgiving Mass " and prayer rally last night . As she basked , closed-eyed , in a shower of religious blessings beneath a monument to the 1986 people-power rebellion - a sculpture of heroic fighters with arms thrust skyward - she seemed to don the mantle of anointed successor as though the job had been waiting for her all her life . As the daughter of a former president , some suggest it virtually has . Whether a product of the moneyed Filipino elite can be the engine for overturning entrenched bureaucracy and endemic corruption is a question that many here ask , warning even as they celebrate that they will watch Arroyo closely .

" I do n't think that business confidence will return if people see that this is just one group of politicians dealbreaking with another , and that they can just buy themselves back into power . That is why we have to go after Estrada and his cronies , " says Mr. Luz , " or suspicion will fall on this government that nothing has changed . " For some , the success in having managed to oust Estrada for Arroyo - trading a former movie actor whose presidency has been racked with reports of professional and personal scandal for a no-nonsense economist who studied at Georgetown University - is partially eclipsed by the way in which it took place . Estrada was the subject of an impeachment trial on corruption , bribery , and fraud charges that was to come to an end in mid-February . But prosecutors resigned en masse last Tuesday after a group of senators voted against admitting key evidence of bank accounts that might lead to Estrada 's conviction . That brought tens of thousands of protesters into the streets of Manila 's Edsa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By week 's end , as the protests swelled in size and began advancing toward the presidential palace , Estrada 's Cabinet resigned . In a final blow , the military and national police on Friday said they were withdrawing support for Estrada and backing Arroyo . If the speed of that downward spiral were not dizzying enough , judicial , military , and religious leaders announced that they would swear in Arroyo by noon Saturday - even before Estrada had agreed to leave office . Indeed , he still has not formally resigned and never used the word " resign " when he announced Saturday that he would leave the palace . That has left some here questioning the very constitutionality of the succession , widely touted as a shining example of democracy in action . " It 's an extraordinarily good thing that Filipinos have brought about this transition without bloodshed , but there 's also the breakdown of the process of impeachment itself , and that does n't bode well for democracy , " says Gerard A. Finin , a Southeast Asia expert at the East-West Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " adds Mr. Finin . " There is some need to have some separation between church and state , and between military and state , and that 's one big blur at this point . " Different this time Still , when compared with the character of the first installment of people power 15 years ago , the depth of military involvement in the civilian process appears to be less extensive . Then , in addition to the importance of Marcos 's loss of military backing , US diplomatic intervention and the presence of American troops here played a key role in the course of events . This time , the US was merely an observer , which many here view as a healthier , more indigenous route for change . That 's a road that seems to be more traveled by others in the region , most recently in Indonesia and Thailand . Reverberations of people-power success are already being felt by Manila 's neighbors . " All of these countries have attempted to find ways to reduce corruption , " says Finin . " It 's a significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may other leaders be learning from Estrada 's mistakes ? Chief among them may be the fact that it simply is not as easy as it used to be for politicians to enrich themselves from public wealth . Estrada 's spending spree was particularly conspicuous because he allegedly had some 17 luxury homes built for himself , his family , and various mistresses over the 2-1/2 years since he was elected president by a wide margin . Powerful photographs of such excesses were due to be exposed to the public during the trial . In a press conference after her swearing-in ceremony , Arroyo said that her predecessor 's woes may not be over . " I want justice to take its course in a dignified manner , so there wo n't be a circus . " Arroyo said she was considering setting up an antigraft commission . Graft , immorality , and Estrada 's compentence were all issues Arroyo addressed in her inaugural speech , moments after taking her oath of office on a makeshft stage at the Edsa shrine . Apart from fighting poverty , Arroyo said she also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in leadership by example . We should promote solid traits such as work ethic and a dignified lifestyle , matching action to rhetoric , performing rather than grandstanding . " Another important moral of the Estrada story is that news , good or bad , travels faster than ever , thanks to Internet access and cellular phones with text-messaging capability . Both of those were pivotal new tools in spreading discontent with Estrada and organizing masses of people in almost as little time as it takes to press the " send " button . With media ever harder to control , what took more than a decade to organize under Marcos took a matter of months under Estrada . Still , even those who were rooting for his downfall admitted they were still a bit stunned by the past 72 hours ' turn of events . Out of sheer habit , some were still calling Arroyo " vice president " after she had already been sworn in as president .
