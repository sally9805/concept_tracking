Chapter One AFTER HOURS AT LA CHINITA by Barry Gifford The Bayview Spooky backside of town , Third Street , San Francisco , late at night , in a motel office . The furnishings were shabby . La Chinita , once an elegant , Spanish-style motel built in the 1930s , was now , in 1963 , run down ; paint was peeling off the walls and the wooden registration desk was chipped and gouged . A decrepit , moth-eaten easy chair and a few other rickety wickers with ripped seats and backs were placed against the walls . Hanging blinds , with several slats missing or broken , covered the glass-paned door . The office was clean , however , and presided over by a bespectacled woman who looked to be in her mid-sixties . She was seated in a lounge chair in front of the desk , knitting and humming softly to herself . Her name was Vermillion Chaney . The tune she was humming was " Just a Closer Walk With Thee . " It was two weeks before Christmas . The telephone behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone continued to ring . It was as if Vermillion did not hear it . The telephone rang eight times before it finally stopped . After the ringing stopped , Vermillion put down her knitting , stood up and walked behind the registration desk , picked up the telephone receiver , and dialed a number . " Was that you just called ? " Vermillion asked into the phone . " Um , okay . Do n't matter . What you doin ' , anyway ? Sure I know it 's 3 o'clock in the mornin ' , I 'm at work ! " Vermillion hung up thephone . She came back around the desk , sat back down in her chair , and resumed knitting . She started singing again , only this time was " What a Friend We Have in Jesus . " The office door began to shake . Somebody was trying to open it but the door was locked . This was followed by a loud knocking . The knocking was hard , insistent . From behind the door came a woman 's scream . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing and stared at the door . The knocking continued . The woman 's voice became hysterical . " You got to help me ! Open up ! " Vermillion put down her knitting , got up , and went to the door . She looked out through one of the missing slats as the woman outside continued to yell . " Miz Chaney , it 's me ! Revancha ! " Vermillion unlocked the door and a woman in her early twenties burst into the office , forcing the older woman back as she brushed past her . " Shut it ! " said Revancha . " Lock the door before he gets here ! " Vermillion stared at the young woman who was half-dressed , wearing only a bra and panties . Clutched to her chest were other garments . Vermillion closed the door . Revancha ran back to it and fastened the chain lock . " What 's goin ' on , Revancha ? You look like a chicken in a bag full of snakes . " Revancha retreated from the door and stopped with her back against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miz Chaney ! Chokin ' me ! Usin ' a strap ! " " Man get what he pay for . " " He gone too far , cat flip his wig . Call for security ! " Vermillion walked back behind the desk , reached down , and came up with a revolver in her right hand . " This is the onliest security I got tonight , baby . " " Where 's Myron ? " asked Revancha . Vermillion shook her head . " He out the loop . Fool got hisself arrested yestiday for receivin ' stolen property . Fake beaver coats . Can you beat that ? I 'm alone here this evenin ' . " The office door started to shake . A man shouted , " Vermillion ! Let me in ! " He rattled the door . " Do n't do it , Miz Chaney ! " said Revancha . " Bitch stole my pants ! " " You 'd best go on , Ray , " said Vermillion . " Not without my pants ! " Vermillion looked at Revancha . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all up , what was piled on the floor . Thought maybe he would n't follow me . " " Man ai n't gon na go away without you give up his trousers . " Ray forced himself against the door , breaking the lock on the handle . Only the chain now prevented him from opening it . He stuck his hand through and attempted to undo the chain . " Do n't do it , Ray , " said Vermillion , " I got a piece . " Ray pushed against the door , breaking the chain . The door flew open and Ray entered . He was a handsome man in his mid-thirties , wearing only a white dress shirt , half unbuttoned , under-shorts , socks , and shoes . He moved toward Revancha .
