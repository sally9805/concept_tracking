It might have seemed that Arnold Schwarzenegger got an enormous boost over the weekend when one of his best-known Republican rivals dropped out of California 's wild gubernatorial race . But by the time Bill Simon exited , his poll numbers registered as little more than an asterisk in the crowded field . " Everybody had been surprised by his poor showing , including him , " says a G.O.P. strategist . Democrats , meanwhile , appeared to be gaining as they coalesced around what is known as the " no-yes " approach : asking voters to cast a ballot against recalling Governor Gray Davis but in favor of Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante as his successor if Davis is ousted . It seems to be working  --  at least for Bustamante . In a Los Angeles Times poll released Sunday , bustamante had a 13-point lead over Schwarzenegger among likely voters asked whom they would vote for to replace Davis . <P> Team Schwarzenegger is hoping that other Republicans in the race  --  particularly State Senator Tom McClintock , around whom the most ardent conservatives have rallied  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's strategists know he must do more than winnow the field to draw voters . Men 35 and younger are known to turn out in force when it comes to films about gun-toting , back-from-the-future robots , but history shows that on Election Day they are more inclined to sit home with a video . Getting them off the couch to vote on Oct. 7 could be the key to a Schwarzenegger victory . <P> The election is so hard to predict that it 's no wonder some powerful players are hedging their bets . Broadcasting tycoon A. Jerrold Perenchio , who was Davis ' largest individual campaign contributor , has joined Schwarzenegger 's team of economic advisers , according to the Sacramento Bee . Investment banker Warren Hellman , who is contributing to the antirecall effort , also turned up among Schwarzenegger 's advisers . " I 'm dead set against a recall , " says Hellman , " but if it happens , I want to be supporting someone I 'm enthusiastic about .
