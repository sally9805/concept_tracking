At night in the early autumn by the stream and hillside . Calaih stands onstage holding a thin stick , waiting . She is small with a plain face , but she has beautiful red hair that reaches almost to the ground . Stephan , a tall young man , enters . He tosses pebbles into the stream . Calaih moves closer to Stephan and breaks the stick in two . He turns to see her . STEPHAN Oh , it is you . ( They stare at each other . ) You are a strange girl . And yet they say the High Lord sent you a silver brush and comb for your long red hair . They say he is in love with you . I would use the word enchanted or fascinated or even curious myself . For I feel it is an impossibility to love someone with whom you have never even spoken . Where is your cow ? CALAIH Eating grass up on the hill . STEPHAN Oh , so you do talk indeed . You must excuse me but so often I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you say nothing , or you will come into my father 's shop only to stare in silence and eat cheese while I laugh and tell stories as I work . Oh , there are times when you will come and hold your torn boots in your arms and nod up and down at my father  --  but never will you speak or smile or nod with me . Why can you not be like your sister , she is gay with every man . Excuse me . I regret mentioning it . There is nothing to be concerned about , Calaih. p. 3 CALAIH The reason I do not speak to you is that I become timid . Do you know I walk up the hill and down again stamping over the sharpest rocks and stones only so my boots will be in need of repair and I may go to the shoemaker 's shop to see you telling stories and laughing . My cow and me , we come here every night and stand on the hill to watch you sitting by this stream looking at the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Nods . ) And sometimes you throw rocks . STEPHAN I did not know that  --  I thought at times you must be  --  CALAIH What ? STEPHAN Haughty . CALAIH Haughty ? STEPHAN ( Nods . ) Because  --  because of your long fine hair and the gifts the High Lord sent to you and your quietness  --  to me , and because of my fondness for you ... I like to watch you eating cheese . CALAIH Do you love me then ? STEPHAN Yes . CALAIH Good . ( She goes and kisses him. ) p. 4 STEPHAN I must go now ... CALAIH Why do you go then ? STEPHAN My love is too deep . CALAIH Please , you must love me in this soft grass , under the night stars . For I have loved you so long , Stephan the Shoemaker 's Son . STEPHAN Oh , Calaih , Orphan of Joshua the Cow Herder . You will get sticks and berries in your soft hair . CALAIH Please , hold me . Hold me . It is cool here tonight . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fade. ) @x The same autumn night in Taretta 's room above the tavern . Taretta is an attractive , sensual woman with dark hair and violet eyes . She sits at her dressing table rubbing cream on her arms and hands . She is wearing a beautiful , seductive robe . Alexton 's voice is heard from outside . ALEXTON Taretta . It is I. TARETTA ( Picking up mirror . ) Come in , Alexton . ( Alexton enters . He looks like a goose . He stands at the entrance nervously , holding a box . ) I will be ready in a minute . You may get undressed if you like . ALEXTON Oh , very well . ( He undresses throughout the following segments . ) I am glad you picked me tonight . I needed your company . My wife is a dowdy woman . This evening she went outside and sat in the garden dirt and cried . TARETTA Yes , she is a very dowdy woman . Why did you marry her ? ALEXTON My life is sick and sad , Taretta . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be dead . TARETTA Tell me , do you think the High Lord would wish to lie with me ? Do you think he would enjoy being ravished by Taretta , Woman of Flaming Nights ? That is how Heilington describes me  --  the Woman of Flaming Nights . p. 6 ALEXTON Do not speak of Heilington . This is my time with you , Taretta . Do not speak of any of the others . Let them sit down-stairs listening to your cries and shrieks knowing I am with you . Let them sit there and drown their sorrows alone , as I have done so many nights . TARETTA Ah , poor Alexton . ALEXTON Do not take any others tonight , Taretta . Let me be the only one . TARETTA If you can satisfy me , I will not . Now  --  shall I take off my robe ? ( He nods . She removes robe and stands before him in seductive undergarments . ) ALEXTON Here are the gifts I bring you . One gold fan . A piece of silk brought from my store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is this ? A rock ? What do I want with a rock , Alexton ? ALEXTON It is a purple rock . I found it by the stream . The purple is like that purple in your eyes , my dearest Taretta . TARETTA I have no use for a rock . ( He takes it back . ) ALEXTON Here is something you will like . ( He presents a headdress. ) p. 7 TARETTA Lovely , very lovely . It will look well with my autumn gown . But I have seen this somewhere before ... I have seen it before indeed . This is your wife 's headdress . She wore it only last week at the autumn festival with a very unsuitable gown . She will recognize this if I wear it . ALEXTON I do not care . It suits you  --  not her . TARETTA Yes , but she will beat your children and your dog with a stick . ALEXTON And I will beat her with a limb off of the cypress tree . Wear it , I beg you ... wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He holds up money pouch . She places on the headdress. ) @x Early the next morning at the two sisters ' cottage . Calaih sits at the table , brushing sticks and grass and berries out of her hair and eating cheese . Taretta enters , with a box of gifts and bags of money . TARETTA Good morning , sister . CALAIH Good morning . TARETTA Where is your cow ? CALAIH Outside . He is lying in the sun . TARETTA I had quite an evening last night . ( Dropping box and bags on table . ) Look at what Alexton has given me . There is a gold fan in there , silk from his shop , jeweled earbobs , and even his wife 's autumn headdress . Here are the gold and coins I have gotten . This much from just Alexton alone ; the rest is from all the others . CALAIH ( Touching the piece of silk . ) That is nice . TARETTA ( She begins counting money . ) Soon I will be leaving this hovel . I will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square . I have those debts left to pay on those new jewels and gowns , then I will be gone . Would you pour me some milk ? My arm is aching . p. 9 CALAIH ( Pouring milk . ) Here . TARETTA ( Drinking milk . ) You know , you are not so plain , Calaih . The High Lord even sent you that silver brush and comb . There is no reason for you to be poor . That is fifty there . But perhaps your appetites are not as developed as mine . I who can satisfy any man in any way . That makes seventy-five . But I will tell you a secret : Though these men are thoroughly nourished through my skills and charms . Ninety . There remains within me a deep craving . Do you understand that ? As if one could pour hot gold into me for an eternity . And it would not be enough . A hundred there . But you do not understand . Though the High Lord sends you gifts , you could not meet his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and six . What a night . ( She begins raking money into her purse . ) CALAIH I am in love with Stephan the Shoemaker 's Son , Taretta . This morning he walked me home with my cow , and he talked to us and petted my cow . He said , " This is a very fine cow you have . " Then he said my name , " Calaih . " Like that he said it , " Calaih . " TARETTA Stephan the Shoemaker 's son . That strange boy ? The one who always has a joke for you ? ( Calaih nods . ) I have always thought him a noodle . He will never be a rich man . But if you love him  --  if you love this noodle  --  p. 10 CALAIH You need not mock Stephan . He is dear to me and of greater worth than any of the baggage you have had . TARETTA You speak in jealousy , Little Calf . ( Mardian , an older woman with purple lips , enters . There are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am Mardian , Social Messenger to the High Lord . May I come in ? TARETTA Yes . Come in . MARDIAN So you are Calaih , Orphan of Joshua the Cow Herder . You hair is as lovely as they say . May I touch it ? ( She feels Calaih 's hair . ) Now here is the proclamation I am to read to you . " Notice to all the Subjects . The High Lord proclaims he shall take Calaih , Orphan of Joshua the Cow Herder , as his Wife and High Lady . The ceremony is to take place on the last night of late winter . Only the bride and Special Attendants to the High Lord are to be allowed at the ceremony . However , there will be a public celebration the following morning on the first day of spring . " ( Noticing Calaih 's unenthusiastic reaction . ) Do you not understand this proclamation , Calaih , Orphan of Joshua the Cow Herder ? CALAIH I am to marry the High Lord on the last night of late winter . p. 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright you are . And such fine hair . This proclamation shall now be taken to the Great Wall where all will read it and envy you your good fortune . TARETTA Wait . Are you certain there is no mistake ? MARDIAN Mistake ? TARETTA In the proclamation . MARDIAN There is no mistake , Taretta , Orphan Whore of Joshua the Cow Herder . Good day now . ( Mardian and the Guards exit . ) TARETTA So . I suppose you can gloat over this proclamation . You with your fine silver brush and comb . CALAIH What does the High Lord look like ? Is he old or young ? TARETTA Older than you  --  but not so old . CALAIH Do you remember the woman he set on fire ? TARETTA Yes , Della  --  that ugly whore . CALAIH I remember how her flesh dripped off like thin wax and she was crying . I heard her crying coming from the flames . TARETTA Della  --  What an eyesore to the town she was , with her pox-marked face and hunched shoulders . They could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where are you going ? p. 12 CALAIH Outside , to sit with my cow . ( Calaih exits . ) TARETTA Very well . Go outside and sit with your cow . I am tired . My arm aches . ( She sits rubbing her hand and arm. ) @x Afternoon , in the middle of winter , in the Apothecary 's treatment room . APOTHECARY ( Finishing mixing his potion . ) The preparation is complete . Come in when you are ready . The wind is cold . I will have to put mortar in these cracks . ( Takes bandages out . ) Tell me about the wedding plans . How is it to have your sister betrothed to the High Lord ? ( Taretta enters , with her arm covered in a cloth . ) TARETTA I pay you money , Apothecary , I expect a cure . Look at my arm ; the bumps have grown . They are darker now and hard . At times I can not move my arm for the pain it causes . APOTHECARY My potion soothes your pain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potion . ) TARETTA For a time , that is all , for a time . APOTHECARY Take down the cloth now . ( She does so , and the Apothecary begins wrapping hot bandages around her arm . She flinches in pain . ) There . Think of something else for a moment and the burning will subside . Tell me about the wedding plans . How is it to have your sister betrothed to the High Lord ? p. 14 TARETTA Do not speak of it . It is of no use to me . My arm is burning . I tell you I can not bear it . Take it off . APOTHECARY Here , lie back now . Lie back and breathe . ( She lies back , breathing heavily . ) It is already the middle of winter . Just think , little Calaih will soon be moving to the castle of the High Lord . TARETTA Damn you ; I said not to speak of it . APOTHECARY Very well , Taretta . ( The Apothecary begins putting up potion and bandages . Taretta lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midwinter by the stream and hillside . Calaih sits wrapped in a thick shawl , despondently breaking sticks . Stephan enters carrying a satchel . She looks up at him and gasps . STEPHAN Where is your cow ? CALAIH Down by the stream , licking stones in the water . STEPHAN You are always with your cow . CALAIH Where have you been ? I go to the shop every day and ask for you , but they do not tell me where you have gone . I wait here with my cow every night in the cold . We look for you to come  --  but you do not come . Where have you been ? STEPHAN I have been away  --  on a journey . Why do you cry ? CALAIH Because I am so stupid . After that one night I thought you loved me , but then the next morning you go away . STEPHAN Calaih , I am no fool . That morning I saw the proclamation . You are to be wedded to the High Lord . He has sought you out and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your children can eat gold every morning for breakfast if they wish . You will be happy . p. 17 CALAIH You believe that riches would make me so happy ? That I would want all this gold and jewels and riches . I would scratch off the flesh from the High Lord 's face . I would stab out the eyes of those fat children eating gold , if only you would not believe I would be wedded for riches . STEPHAN I am sorry . I know you would not be . CALAIH Tell me  --  STEPHAN What ? CALAIH Do you want me ? STEPHAN Yes . CALAIH For a wife ? STEPHAN Yes . CALAIH I will go tell my cow . STEPHAN Calaih , wait ! You can not marry me . It will be against the proclamation . I will not see you hurt . CALAIH He will not hurt me . He does not love me . He thinks my hair is beautiful . He sends a silver comb and brush saying , " For your beautiful long red hair , I worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he loves my hair , I will chop it off and send it to him in a box . But he shall not have me . I will go to the Letter Writer and have him send a message to the High Lord . I will say kindly that I can not marry him as I am betrothed to Stephan the Shoemaker 's Son . p. 18 STEPHAN Would he accept such a letter ? CALAIH I will make my mark on it . STEPHAN I have no sums of money or riches . I can not even give you a betrothal ring . CALAIH Fine then . I do not like objects dangling on my fingers and arms . STEPHAN You do not ? CALAIH No . STEPHAN Then would you take that star for your ring ? CALAIH Which one ? STEPHAN That small , very bright one . CALAIH The one up there ? STEPHAN Yes . CALAIH If you give it to me , I will take it forever . STEPHAN I give it to you . CALAIH I will go tell my cow . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning in the middle of winter at the Letter Writer 's . The Letter Writer sits behind his desk talking to Calaih . LETTER WRITER You say you want to send a message to the High Lord ? CALAIH Yes , that is what I want to do . But I have not learned how to do writing ... so I come to you . LETTER WRITER Yes . I see . What kind of paper do you prefer ? CALAIH Paper ? It makes no difference . LETTER WRITER No difference . Certainly you do not want to send a message to the High Lord on coarse brown parchment . It would be an insult . You would appear a fool . CALAIH Something nice then . Something he would like . LETTER WRITER Let me see . I believe this elegant French scroll paper would be proper . It has a rich smooth texture with a colorful handpainted border . Here , you may touch it if you like . CALAIH Yes , it is very pretty . LETTER WRITER Now I believe gold ink is what you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this . ( Handing her a sheet of lettering . ) Here , look at these lettering samples . See which you prefer . p. 20 CALAIH ( Looking at lettering . ) I do not read  --  I can not tell . Mmmm  --  this looks nice . LETTER WRITER Let me see . What ! Block style ? For a letter in gold ink to the High Lord ? This is the lettering used when someone has lost a horse or a pig ; this is the lettering used to denote the color of a cow 's hide or the spots on swine . Block style is not something to be used on handpainted imported French scroll to be delivered to the High Lord . CALAIH Very well then . You pick it out . I tell you I do not read . I do not know these different kinds of lettering and what is best . All I know is I have an important message that I must send right away to the High Lord , I do not know how to write so I come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my cow is waiting for me out on the streets ; he will be cold . LETTER WRITER I am aware it is midwinter . I did not know you had a cow waiting for you on the streets . Tell me your message . I shall write it down quickly and recopy it later in a way I think suitable . I can have it delivered too if you want . CALAIH Yes , do . LETTER WRITER There will be an extra fee . CALAIH Yes . p. 21 LETTER WRITER So , tell me  --  what is this message ? CALAIH Yes , the message . Let me see . Ah ... Dear High Lord , I humbly thank you for your proposal to be wedded with me on the last night of late winter . Yet I tell you I am unable to accept this ... engagement , as I am betrothed to Stephan the Shoemaker 's Son . We are to be wedded in the early spring when he returns from Nalesca , where he is building a cottage for us both . ( She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She then continues spontaneously . ) In the village of Nalesca he will be no longer Stephan the Shoemaker 's Son  --  but Stephan the Shoemaker , and I will be his wife , Calaih the Cow Herder . ( Pause . ) As you have expressed such fondness for my hair , I would be happy to cut it off and send it to you in a box . Please let me know your wishes . Your Humble Servant , Calaih , Orphan of Joshua the Cow Herder . There . LETTER WRITER Do you really want this sent ? CALAIH Yes , it must be sent . You must send it . LETTER WRITER Very well then , make your mark . ( She does so ) It will cost you a great deal . What with the fine paper and ink and lettering that you have chosen . It will cost perhaps more than a cow herder 's orphan can pay . p. 22 CALAIH ( Removing comb from her bag . ) Here is a silver comb for the payment . Look , there is even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you get this ? CALAIH It was a gift to me . ( Pause , as he examines it suspiciously . ) Look here , you may have this brush too if you want . ( He looks at the brush . ) I would not want to keep it for myself  --  though Taretta might have liked it . LETTER WRITER Mmmm . Very well . I will write up your letter as we have planned in exchange for this silver brush and comb . CALAIH And deliver it too ? LETTER WRITER Yes , it will be delivered . CALAIH Thank you . Good day . LETTER WRITER ( As she is leaving. ) @x Early evening on the last night of late winter in Taretta 's room above the tavern . Taretta is wearing her seductive robe . Her hair is unkempt . She is sick and pale . Her arm is wrapped in red velvet . Alexton calls from outside . ALEXTON ( Off . ) Taretta  --  ( She starts , then begins dabbing perfume generously onto her arm . ) TARETTA Yes , come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  TARETTA Ah , Alexton . You are early . It is not yet dark . You may get undressed if you like . It has been some time since I have chosen you . Forgive me , but I have been in great demand these past weeks . ( Standing up weakly , supporting herself on the chair . ) I will make it up to you though  --  you know I shall . Come , do my breasts still make you tremble ? ( He stares aghast , taking in her total dissipation . ) So , show me the gifts you bring and we will begin . ALEXTON I have brought no gifts . You have not been in demand . No one has been coming here to you . They all say you are sick with a rotting disease . p. 24 TARETTA Liars . They are liars . ALEXTON Why do you wear that red velvet on your arm ? TARETTA I told you  --  it is the style of France . ALEXTON I do not believe you . Take it off and let me see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her arm . ) Let me see your arm . Take this off ! I insist  --  let me see  --  TARETTA Let go . Let go ! Do not touch my arm . ( She breaks away , trembling in pain . ) ALEXTON ( Recovering himself . ) Here is my advice to you , Taretta . Go to the Blacksmith 's . He is skilled with an axe ; his blades are sharp . He is quick and accurate . I tell you this because , unlike all the rest , I once cared something for you . I do not want to see you dead in the morning . TARETTA Get out . ALEXTON Yes , but before I go , I would like my wife 's autumn headdress . There has been no peace in my family since I gave it to you some time ago . My wife has beaten my dog to death with a stick , and we have been very miserable ... I must have it back . I will pay you a fair price for it ... Are you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will get it  --  but you must do something for me . You must tell them I am well , that they can come to me . Horace the Tavern Keeper , he will not let them up . In the mornings he tells me I am through , that they do not want to come . But that is a lie  --  he will not let them up . You go tell them . Get Casta the Miller  --  tell him I will bite and lick his big red ears , tell him that . And to Heilington make a noise like this , slurp , slurp , slurp , slurp , slurp ... He will know what I mean , slurp , slurp . ALEXTON No one will come , Taretta  --  they know you are diseased and they have no use for you . Now give me the headdress and I will leave . TARETTA No use for me . No use for Taretta  --  the Woman of Flaming Nights ! ALEXTON Taretta , the headdress . TARETTA Get out . You get out , you worm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You tell them to look for me when it turns dark . ( Alexton leaves. ) @x Early evening on the last night of late winter at the sisters ' cottage . Calaih is seated at the table sewing her wedding dress , eating cheese and singing . She finishes sewing , stands and puts the dress up to her , checking the fit . She continues to sing . Mardian Enters with the two Guards behind her . MARDIAN Your hair is so lovely this evening . Are you ready to go ? CALAIH What  --  MARDIAN Get your things together . It is time to go . CALAIH To go  --  MARDIAN Why do you stand so stunned ? Is it not the last evening at the end of winter , the night of your marriage to the High Lord ? Come , where are your things ? Do you have anything to take ? CALAIH No . MARDIAN The High Lord has asked me to see that you bring your silver brush and comb so that he may brush and comb out your fine hair late tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I have lost them . MARDIAN Indeed . How careless you were to lose them . p. 27 CALAIH Yes . MARDIAN Well , come then . We must prepare you for the ceremony . CALAIH Did the High Lord not get my message ? MARDIAN What ? CALAIH I sent him a message . Do you not remember ? MARDIAN A message ? CALAIH Yes . After the message was sent , the marriage proclamation , they took it down from the Great Wall . MARDIAN Did they ? CALAIH To have this proclamation taken down  --  does this not mean something ? MARDIAN Nothing , perhaps , except the paper was worn and could not stand the strength and ice of the late winter 's wind . Come now , there is much to be done before the ceremony . ( She takes hold of Calaih 's arm . ) CALAIH Please , wait  --  he must have gotten my message  --  I took great trouble to send it properly . It was written on beautiful fine paper , the ink was of real gold . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a message . p. 28 CALAIH Oh ! So , he must know that tomorrow morning Stephan is returning from Nalesca , where he has built our home . We are to be married . MARDIAN If the High Lord has received any such message , he has chosen to disregard it . Come . I can wait no longer . There is no time for further arguments . ( She motions for Guards . The following speeches of Mardian and Calaih occur simultaneously . ) You must be cleaned and bathed and scrubbed with a brush . The dirt must come out of your nails and the wax from inside of your ears . You must be powdered and perfumed and oiled and your hair must squeak and shine and be brushed and braided as the High Lord has demanded . CALAIH ( As the Guards come for her . ) But the proclamation was taken down from the wall . No further announcements were made  --  I can not go now  --  I have my own plans . Look , here is my wedding gown . That small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my betrothal band  --  he gave it to me , it is mine  --  let go . Stop it  --  you are tearing my gown ! Wait  --  let go of my hair ! Ahh  --  I despise you . I despise you ! Stop ! Stop ! I will go then . I will go . MARDIAN There now . Take her to the carriage . CALAIH Please  --  could I take my cow ? I want my cow . p. 29 MARDIAN I am sorry ; but there is no room for a cow in your carriage . ( The guards lead out Calaih as Mardian follows. )
