MAMMOTH TREES , GOLDEN PEAKS , AND BREATHTAKING SOLITUDE HIGHLIGHT 6 NEW HIKES IN CALIFORNIA 'S HIGH SIERRA . // BACKPACKER READERS RECENTLY VOTED California 's Sierra Nevada one of America 's top three mountain ranges , and John Muir 's ghost is n't arguing . The father of environmentalism once described the Range of Light as " the most divinely beautiful of all the mountain chains I have ever seen . " Here , soaring cliffs , crystalline streams , flower-choked meadows , and cathedral-like groves of old-growth sequoia create some of the most inspiring wilderness backpacking in the world . The best slice of the High Sierra arguably lies within Sequoia and Kings Canyon . These adjoining parks protect an array of forested gorges , blue rivers , and sawtoothed ridgelines-plus 14,491-foot Mt . Whitney , the Lower 48 's highest peak . Three national forests buffer them , guaranteeing solitude for anyone willing to walk a few miles . You 'll find traffic on the Pacific Crest and John Muir Trails , but throw in some cross-country travel and an untrailed pass or two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer six extraordinary Sierra journeys , each one scouted , mapped , and GPS-enabled . HIKES BY STEVE HOWE 1 Wallace Col Ramble Explore a high-country granite paradise . None of the usual adjectives does justice to this 32-mile , 4- to 6-day circuit through Dusy Basin , LeConte Canyon , Evolution Basin , and the Middle Fork of Bishop Creek . So we wo n't lay a single " stunning " or " jaw-dropping " on you . But we will say that this trip is best done slowly , to take advantage of numerous 5-star fishing lakes , sidehikes , and campsites . The adventure starts with a stout 2,000-foot climb over Bishop Pass to excellent LNT camping on granite benches in Dusy Basin . On day 2 , descend steeply to LeConte Canyon and the John Muir Trail ( JMT ) , and climb far up to Muir Pass , with its magnificent stone hut ( it 's an emergency shelter ) . Beyond lies broad Evolution Basin , named in 1895 by its first backpackers , Theodore Solomons and Leigh Bierce . ( While still in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Ford Evolution Creek above Sapphire Lake , then ascend eastward past scenic alpine campsites to Wallace Col , the low point south of 13,377-foot Mt . Wallace . Descending Wallace Col requires careful hand and foot placement for about 30 feet of steep rubble near the ridgetop , after which you 'll need an ice axe to descend the snow slope below . Novices should be belayed here . Continue down through a sprawling grassy basin , staying left ( west ) of Echo , Moonlight , and Topsy Turvy Lakes . Look back for fine views of Haeckel , Wallace , and Powell peaks . Beyond Topsy Turvy , bear left on slabs , ford two streams , and find good campsites at Dingleberry Lake . Hike out on the trail to the Lake Sabrina trailhead and a 9-mile walk or shuttle to your car . ( Or skip the road by adding 6.4 steep miles on Table Mountain Trail to South Lake Road , a mile below your car . ) THE WAY : From Bishop , go 15 miles west on Bishop Creek Road ; turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park at road 's end . TOP DAYHIKE : Mt . Agassiz Hike and scramble 4,200 feet to life-list views of the Palisades . This 13,893-foot peak is one of the Sierra 's most striking daylong challenges for fit hikers and scramblers . Its west face spur , pioneered by Norman Clyde in 1925 , is a straightforward ( though strenuous ) Class II , 14-mile round-trip from South Lake via Bishop Pass , The summit view to the southeast is among the most spectacular in the Sierra , spanning Agassiz Col to the range 's highest and most ragged ridgelines . Look southeast for 14,242-foot North Palisade , California 's fourth highest and perhaps gnarliest peak . Follow driving directions for the Wallace Col loop . 2 Harrison Pass Trek Ditch the crowds on a high , rugged loop . This 4- to 5-day , 48-mile circuit crosses the Kings-Kern Divide twice-first over 13,200-foot Forester Pass , the PCT 's high point , then over Harrison Pass , a trailless notch between Mts . Ericsson and Stanford . You 'll climb from deep in Kings Canyon to some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail past dramatic cliffs , sweeping views , and fine granite-ledge campsites . Begin by hiking up cliff-ringed Bubbs Creek along the JMT/PCT to Forester Pass . Good campsites can be found at timberline below the pass . The southern side of Forester can be tricky with early-season snowdrifts , but the path quickly flattens out and leads you south to an intersection with the Kern River and Lake South America Trails . Follow them to Lake South America and climb north across open meadows toward Harrison Pass , an obvious notch marked by a large cairn below Mt . Stanford . In this off-trail section , you trace a route pioneered by newlyweds Bolton and Lucy Brown in 1896 . The old sheep trail they found still appears on topos , but the track has long since faded . Until late summer you 'll want an ice axe and sturdy boots to descend the north side of Harrison Pass . Drop down the snowy couloirs past a lake set beneath the towering cliffs of Mt . Ericsson , then thrash down through willow thickets and brush to East Creek . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debris . You 'll encounter a horse trail , then a fence , and quickly descend 2.5 miles to a swift , roughly-thigh-deep crossing of Bubbs Creek just past mile 40 . Turn left on your original approach trail , and reach your car in 8 miles . THE WAY : Start at the ranger station at the end of Kings Canyon Rd . ( CA 180 ) 37.6 miles NE of Grant Grove . Permits , water , and bear lockers are available . TOP DAYHIKE : Granite Basin A strenuous but scenic grind yields idyllic camping and picnic spots . An excellent hike or overnight for the aerobically inclined , the Copper Creek Trail soars 5,000 feet in 6.35 miles , crosses a low pass , then drops to killer meadow sites in Granite Basin at mile 7.9 . Good switchbacks and a gravelly trail make this less of a cartilage-buster than one might expect . Black bears and cougars are occasionally encountered along this trail , so travel noisily . The return is fast , so you can linger in the basin . Follow driving directions for Harrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailhead. 3 Sawtooth-Glacier-Kaweah Loop Scramble to summits in the high , wild Kaweah Range . This 32-mile trek offers excellent alpine fishing and memorable walk-up summits , including Sawtooth Peak and the more challenging Red Kaweah . Head up the Sawtooth Pass Trail from Mineral King to Groundhog Meadow . Turn left at a blank , faded metal sign and head straight uphill ( east-northeast ) to rejoin Sawtooth Pass Trail ( which made a long detour to Monarch Lake ) and ascend neighboring Glacier Pass . At this scenic notch , you 'll see the steep switch-backs of Black Rock Pass , your next destination . Descend cross-country to Black Rock Trail , then hump up and over the pass to Little Five Lakes and the old patrol cabin at Big Arroyo Creek . Get on the High Sierra Trail uphill of the cabin , and follow it southeast until you can climb straight northeast ( off-trail ) to a lake-dotted cirque beneath the southwest face of Red Kaweah . The summit route goes around the east side of the highest lake , then turns abruptly east to climb the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is scrambling , not rock climbing , but be cautious among the many small cliffs . To close the loop , reverse your course to Little Five Lakes , then turn left ( east ) and follow winding trail through Lost Canyon 's gorgeous campsites , Columbine Lake Basin , and craggy Sawtooth Pass . From the pass , it 's an easy walk up 12,343-foot Sawtooth Peak before dropping like an escalator down to Mineral King . THE WAY : From Three Rivers , go 4 miles NE on CA 198 ; turn SE onto Mineral King Rd . Drive 24 miles to Sawtooth trailhead . Beware : Mineral King 's notorious marmots emerge salt-starved in spring to chew on engine belts and hoses . Some hikers put up chicken wire ; others leave hoods open so the rodents do n't take refuge inside . TOP DAYHIKE : Garfield &; Dillonwood Sequoia Groves Enjoy big sequoias far from the maddening boardwalk . Most giant sequoias are in developed front-country areas , but these secluded groves are private paradises for hikers with strong compass skills . Start at South Fork Campground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fork Drive east of Lake Kaweah . At road 's end , do not head straight upcanyon along the Ladybug Trail . Instead , backtrack down the road and look for a subtle southbound trail traversing the brushy lower slopes of Dennison Ridge . Hike 4.3 miles to Garfield Grove . Look for King Arthur , the 10th largest sequoia on Earth ; it 's 270 feet tall and 104 feet around . To reach the huge Dillonwood Grove ( which was added to Sequoia National Park in 2001 after its purchase by the Save-the-Redwoods League ) , continue upcanyon 1.23 miles to the abandoned Summit Trail , which switchbacks right ( southwest ) , takes a long , rising traverse across the saddle of Dennison Ridge , then turns east . A mile beyond the saddle , bushwhack right ( south ) and descend straight down a broad slope 800 feet and into the 1,540-acre grove . TRIP PLANNER SEQUOIA &; KINGS CANYON NATIONAL PARKS Season June through early October . Snowbound passes , high creeks , and mosquitoes complicate early summer travel . Cautions The hazards of high altitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be mitigated with some common sense . Sierra black bears are particularly tough to ouifox ; they 're highly food- conditioned . Use trailhead storage lockers and rent bearproof food canisters for backcountry travel . Permits Required for all overnight trips in the parks and neighboring wilderness areas . You must obtain them from the land management agency that administers your entry trailhead ; this often means you get permits for a hike that goes into the parks at a U.S. Forest Service office . Designated campsites are not typically required . Summer reservations are accepted for Sequoia-Kings beginning March 1 , and at least 3 weeks prior to your trip . Fax or mail only . A few slots are reserved for walk-ins . Permits for trips starting inside Sequoia-Kings cost $15 per permit .

The Giant Sequoias Evolutionary proof that size does matter Sequoias are n't the world 's tallest trees ; that honor goes to their cousins , the coastal redwoods . But they are the Earth 's largest single living organisms by volume , and the biggest trees are more than 300 feet tall and 100 feet around . Mature sequoias require up to 1,000 gallons of water per day , so the largest ones grow in or near stream drainages . As they age , sequoia trunks become structurally complex ; until recently , the gargantuan Washington Tree in Giant Forest contained 48 secondary trunks . In 2003 , a lightning-caused fire damaged it ; in 2005 , winter snow tore off many upper trunks . Today the Washington Tree is only 115 feet tall , with limited foliage at the top , yet scientists think it may survive for centuries .
