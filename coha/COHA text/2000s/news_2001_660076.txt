<p> On a recent afternoon , British author Philip Pullman was writing a letter to a 16-year-old Christian girl outraged that he had killed God in his latest book . It was an unusual exchange , given that God is usually off-limits in novels for teens . Mr. Pullman 's fantasy " The Amber Spyglass " and works by well-known authors C.S. Lewis and Louisa May Alcott are but a few on bookstore shelves that address head on what is now called the last taboo in stories for young people : religion . Reviewers , authors , and teens themselves say the pickings are slim when it comes to fiction that explores faith and God . " The whole spiritual thing has not appeared in young adult fiction . By and large , it 's been taboo to talk about religion or God , " says Patty Campbell ( no relation ) , a critic and editor in Fallbrook , Calif . Of concern to critics is that a significant aspect of many people 's daily lives - and a subject teens are often grappling with - is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence sends a message , they say , that such topics are n't important . It 's an especially obvious omission when AIDS , suicide , terrorism , and incest are fair play in teen novels . Of the thousands of books published for young adults ( ages 10 to 16 ) in the past six years , maybe two dozen novels have acknowledged questions of faith , says Ms. Campbell , who writes a column for The Horn Book , a children 's book review magazine . The list grows longer if you consider the past century - adding classics like " Heidi , " " Little Women , " and " A Wrinkle in Time . " Many novels offer morality and value lessons , but contemporary fiction is still well behind in portraying the prominence of religion in US society . About 95 percent of Americans routinely tell pollsters that they believe in God , and 35 percent of teens told Gallup in 1998 that religious faith was the most important influence in their lives , with 42 percent having attended a religious service in the past week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that address faith , which they say would help bring the topic into the mainstream . " I do wish that religion would be discussed more in teen novels . Maybe then religion would n't be such a touchy subject , because people would be used to reading and talking about it , " says ninth-grader Jared Bovinet , a reviewer for the Teen People Book Club , in an e-mail interview . While religious publishers have found success with novels for teens , mainstream publishers tend to stay away from the subject . Nonfiction offerings about spirituality and self-help , which are a big market , seem to present fewer pitfalls . Novelists say publishers are often concerned that if they write about religion , their books will either alienate the public because they are too preachy , or anger the devout because they are not true enough to doctrine . It 's not something all authors can pull off . But religion in general is being discussed more widely in society - both in the media and from tone-setting places like the White House . With the overall number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise , it may mean more room for experimentation . Different approaches to spirituality Last fall , HarperCollins released " I Believe in Water : Twelve Brushes With Religion , " a collection of short stories by authors who write for young adults . Marilyn Singer , the editor of the collection and a contributor , says it was prompted by her own interest in the topic and the writings of Campbell and others , who have highlighted the absence of such works . " When I heard about that book , I thought , ' What a great idea , ' " says Melanie Kroupa , who publishes her own line of children 's and young-adult books for Farrar , Straus &; Giroux . She says it 's a stellar group of authors , and the subject is broad enough " to allow for a lot of different kinds of things - not only different religions , but different approaches to spirituality . I wish I had thought of it . " Others in the industry are less enthusiastic . They say it can be hard to find high-quality work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not a subject we 're eager to tackle , " says Joan Slattery , an editor and publishing director of children 's books at Knopf . " As a rule , it 's not an area we generally explore . " One notable exception is Pullman 's book , which has had reviewers and readers buzzing about its theology since it was published last fall . " The Amber Spyglass " is the third installment in the trilogy that began with " The Golden Compass . " It and the other installments are page-turners in which young people have adventures with animals and witches and live in a world where the church is not to be trusted , and God , among other things , is a liar . " It 's a very deep thing to say . I was pretty shocked to see that , " says Sam Miller , an eighth grader at Jean Farb Middle School in San Diego , who says he reads the Bible but does not go to church . " Mainstream religion does not see God as corrupt . " Jamie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she and her 13-year-old sister talked at length about the book when it came out . They discussed the religious themes , including an allusion to the Adam and Eve story . Her sister even wondered if it would be banned since it is partially about a war with God . " Your early adolescence is the time when you first begin to wonder , ' Is there really a God ? ' " said Pullman in an interview . " This is a time when these questions are very big , and a lot of young people are thinking about them . " " It 's probably true that there was a certain part of the writing of ' The Amber Spyglass , ' the whole trilogy , really , which is deliberately counter to C.S. Lewis 's argument - that the world is a hideous place and growing up is a terrible thing and we must escape from it at all costs . I wanted to say clearly , this world is a wonderful place , it 's beautiful , it 's marvelous , and we should not run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great as well . " Fantasy writers ask tough questions It is in books like Pullman 's - along with those by J.R.R. Tolkien , Lewis , and even the Star Wars novels - where kids are being exposed to theology , says Phyllis Tickle , author of " God-Talk in America " and a contributing editor in religion at Publishers Weekly magazine . In general , she says , there is a " dearth of theologically evocative material " for young people , but fantasy is helping shape their views . It 's there that tough topics can be dealt with because the stories take place in make-believe worlds - where good and evil often do battle . Despite the contribution fantasy writers are making , the absence of religion is still felt by the industry . In the past few years , more authors have spoken out about it , and tried to tackle it themselves . For example , prolific author Jane Yolen co-wrote " Armageddon Summer " an award-winning book about two teens who come to terms with what they believe when the world is about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the characters ends up in an exploration of the " spiritual dimension beyond him , " explains Gary Schmidt , a professor at Calvin College in Grand Rapids , Mich . That 's a good thing , he says . " Literature is not evangelism , not purposed specifically at religious conversion . But literature is an aesthetic expression of the human experience in all its facets - including the religious , " he writes in the Nov. /Dec. 2000 issue of The Five Owls , a children 's lit publication . He says one of the authors who has best captured this is Katherine Paterson , author of such books as " The Bridge to Terabithia " and " Jacob Have I Loved . " " Her work is intensely religious , but not overt in a way that is meant to be evangelical , " he says in an interview . Ms. Paterson herself says such topics can be tough for some of today 's writers , who grew up in a more secular time . " I think it 's missing , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't say we 've got to have more of it , if we do n't have the writers for that . " For now , Pullman is among those few who find themselves responding to letters about theology - like the one from the 16-year-old who liked his story , but tripped on the killing of God . He tells her that The Authority whose end he described is the God of the Spanish Inquisition and the persecutor of the Jews . He prefers the idea of something called Dust , which permeates the universe and exists when humans are wise , kind , and curious . " So maybe , " he tells her , " I 'm upholding the same God that you believe in , but under a different name . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2001 . The Christian Science Publishing Society
