PARIS . 18 SEPTEMBER , 1941 . Casson woke in a room in a cheap hotel and smoked his last cigarette . The window by the bed was open and the shade , yellow and faded , bumped gently against the sill in the morning breeze . When it moved he could see fierce blue sky , a bar of sunlight on the lead sheeting of the roof across the courtyard . Something in the air , he thought , a ghost of something , and the sky was lit a certain way . So then , autumn . A knock at the door ; a woman came in and sat on the edge of the bed . She had a room down the hall and came to see him sometimes . He offered her the cigarette , she inhaled and gave it back . " Thank you , " she said . She stood up , pulled her slip over her head and hung it on a nail in the wall , then climbed in next to him . " Tell me , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sky . Nothing much . " She pulled the blanket up so it covered their shoulders . " You live in a dream , " she said . " You think it 's wrong ? " He felt her shrug . " I do n't know -- why bother ? " She settled next to him , so the tips of her breasts brushed the skin of his back , ran a finger down the line of hair from his chest to his stomach , and slid her hand between his legs . He stubbed the cigarette out carefully in a saucer he kept on the windowsill , then closed his eyes . For a time he stayed like that , adrift . " Well , " he said , " maybe you 're right . " He turned to face her , she rested a knee on his hip , opening her legs . After a moment she said , " Your hands are always warm . " " Warm hands , cold heart . " She laughed , then kissed him . " Not you , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandered . It was very quiet , all he could hear was her breathing , long and slow , and the yellow shade , bumping against the sill in the morning air . Place Clichy . He sat at an outside table at a caf and sipped the roast barley infusion the waiter brought him . Coffee , he thought , remembering it . Very expensive now , he did n't have the money . He stared out at the square , Clichy a little lost in the daylight , the cheap hotels and dance halls gray and crooked in the morning sun , but Casson did n't mind . He liked it -- in the same way he liked deserted movie sets and winter beaches . On the chair next to him somebody had left a damp copy of yesterday 's Le Soir . He spread it out on the table . ... the low hills of Lokhvitsa , brooding at nightfall , the steep banks of the river Dnieper , the grumble of distant cannonade . Suddenly , white Very lights fired from flare pistols , sputtering as they float to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linked up with Kleist 's Sixteenth Panzer ! The Kiev pocket has snapped shut like a trap : 300,000 Russian casualties , 600,000 taken prisoner , five Soviet armies obliterated . Now , Kiev must fall within hours . Victorious Wehrmacht columns burst into song as they prepare to march into the defeated city . Casson shook his head -- who writes this shit ? His eyes wandered to the top of the column . Oh , from their foreign correspondent , Georges Broux . Well , that explained it . Once upon a time , when he 'd been Jean Casson , producer of gangster films , with an office near the Champs-Elyses , Georges Broux had sent him a screenplay . Morning Must Come , something like that . Maybe it was Dawn that had to come , or A New Day , but that was the general idea . La Belle France brought to her knees by decadence and socialism . " Dear Georges , thanks for letting us have a look ; unfortunately ... " And did , Casson wondered , the Wehrmacht actually burst into song ? Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the cigarette stub and lit it , sipped his barley coffee , turned to the movie page . Playing at the Impriale , over on the Champs-Elyses , was Premier Rendezvous -- first date -- with Danielle Darrieux and Louis Jourdan . If you 'd seen that , the Gaumont had " a frothy romantic comedy . " Or , if you were really hard to please , you could go out to Neuilly for " a little jewel , bubbling over with mirth ! A sly French wink ! " Casson read through the listings for the smaller theatres , sometimes they ran revivals and his old films showed up . No Way Out or The Devil 's Bridge . Maybe , even , Night Run . He heard the engine -- tuned to a perfect hum -- and forced himself to look up casually . A black traction-avant Citron , a Gestapo car , had pulled to the curb in front of the caf . Casson 's heart hammered against his ribs . He bent over the newspaper , concealing his face , and turned the page . A goalie leaped toward the edge of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumble of print , this team 2 , that team 1 . He had an identity card , Marin , Jean Louis , and a ration book . Nothing more . It was n't a quality fake , he 'd bought it from a taxi driver , one phone call and that was the end of him . Casson was wanted by the Gestapo ; taken in for questioning at the rue des Saussaies office three months earlier , he had crawled out an unbarred window and escaped over the roof . Dumb luck , Casson thought , the kind that does n't come a second time . The driver got out of the Citron and held the back door open . A tall man in a dark suit , a raincoat worn over his shoulders , came out of the little hotel next to the caf . He was young and fair , very white , very drawn . There was n't much , really there was n't anything , that you could n't buy on the place Clichy . Perhaps the German officer had bought something he had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like it . He paused at the door , put one hand on the roof , leaned forward . Was he going to be sick ? No , he climbed into the car , the driver slammed the door . Look down . That was barely in time . Casson stared at people -- who were they ? It was just something he could not stop himself from doing . And the man who 'd held the door for his superior had caught him at it . Nantes 0 , Lille 0 . Caen 3 , Rouen 2 . Please . The Citron idled , then the front door closed , the driver put the car in gear and drove off , turning onto the boulevard Batignolles . His room at the Hotel Victoria . Six floors up , under the roof . Ten by ten , narrow iron bed , a chair , a washstand . Ancient wallpaper , the color of oatmeal , and bare wooden boards . Faint smell of sulfur , burned to get rid of the bugs , faint smell of black tobacco . And all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hook in the wall . Not so bad . He rubbed his thumb idly across a small stain above the pocket . He 'd bought it back in August , when he still had a little money , from a peddler 's cart in the place Rpublique . For winter , he 'd thought , but he was n't the one who was going to wear it this winter . He hunted through the pockets , made sure the Goddess of Luck had n't left a fifty-franc note in there for him . No , nothing . He rolled the coat up tight , held it to the right side of his body . It was his one possession and La Patronne knew it . He owed three weeks ' rent , if the owner caught him taking it out of the hotel , she 'd stop him , would make a great scene , would probably call the police . Like a mythic beast she stood behind the hotel desk , keeping guard on the door . Draped always in black , wearing broken carpet slippers for her sore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could smell money in the next block . She truly could , Casson thought . He closed his door silently , went downstairs one cautious step at a time . On the landing of the second floor he became aware of conversation in the lobby , something not right in the tone of it . Halfway down the final flight he stopped . He could see black shoes , blue trousers , the bottom of a cape . Merde . Police . Not an exotic moment in the life of the Hotel Victoria , but Casson could have done without it . He stood still , held his breath , listened intently . About forty years old . Was last seen . If by chance he should . He went cold . Tried to swallow . The police voice stopped . A long moment . Casson could hear people talking in the street outside the door . Then , finally , the patronne . Mmm , no , she did n't think so . It was n't anybody she 'd seen . Of course she would notify the prfecture if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He counted to three , then clomped down the stairs in a hurry , making all the noise he could . The policeman turned to glance at him as he went by , the patronne looked up from the photograph . " Bonjour , madame , " he muttered -- busy , tense , angry at the world . She started to say something to him , he could feel her mind working , but he was through the door in three strides and that was that . He went around the corner , slowed down , got his composure back . Then headed south , toward the 3rd Arrondissement . A bright day , the little ghost of a chill still hung in the morning air . Early autumn this year , he thought . Which meant : early winter . Well , good . Maybe he 'd get a few francs more for the overcoat . He took backstreets , crossing into the 10th Arrondissement . Turgot , Condorcet , d Abbeville . Then the rue des Petits-Hotels -- yes , there were some . On rue Paradis , too many Germans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : to cross the boulevard you could take either the rue de la Fidelit or the passage du Dsir -- street of fidelity or alley of desire . Which ? He took the alley , but noted that it ran downhill . Next , he hurried across the broad boulevard Magenta . Too wide , too open . That fucking Haussmann , he thought , rebuilding Paris a hundred years earlier , designing open boulevards to facilitate field-of-fire , cannon shot , against the revolutionary mobs of days to come . A visionary , in his way . He had destroyed the medieval rat 's nest of Paris streets , anybody , even a lumbering German , could find his way around . Real Parisians , even those , like Casson , who 'd spent their lives in the Passy district of the snob 16th , knew the value of a good maze , rank with crumbling drains and metal pissotires on the corners . Head down on the narrow streets . Baggy flannel pants , suit jacket with the collar up , three days ' growth of beard , workman 's peaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someone who belonged in the quarter if you did n't look too hard , if you missed the melancholy intelligence in the eyes . He was dark ; dark hair , coloring like a suntan that never really went away . A small scar on the cheekbone . Lean body , forty or so . Something about Casson had always made him seem a little beat up by life , even in the old days , on the terrasses of the good cafs -- knowing eyes , a half-smile that said it did n't matter what you knew . He liked women , women liked him . Two flics pedaled by on their bicycles , one of the wheels squeaked each time it went around . Casson watched them . Sooner or later , he thought . He would be taken . Sad , but there was n't much he could do about it , life just went that way . He knew too many people in Paris , at least a few of them on the wrong side . Or maybe it would be some German version of Simenon 's Maigret : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lunch . Taking his pipe from clenched teeth and pointing it at his assistant . " Mark my words , Heinrich , he will return to his old haunts , to the city he knows . Of this you may be certain . " And , in fact , when all was said and done , that was the way it turned out . He 'd gone home -- the romans policiers had it just right . Why ? He did n't know . Everywhere else felt wrong , was all he knew . Maybe to live the fugitive life you had to start young , for him it was too late . Still , he did n't want to make it easy for them . Sooner or later , went that week 's motto on the Casson family crest , but not today . 3rd Arrondissement -- the old Jewish quarter . Cobbled lanes and alleys , silence , deep shadow , Hebrew slogans chalked on the walls . Rue du March des Blancs-Manteaux , the smell of onions frying in chicken fat made Casson weak in the knees . He 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bouillon Zip when he could afford the fifty centimes . Between two leaning tenements , the municipal pawnshop . Massive stone portals ; Libert , Egalit , and Fraternit carved solemnly into the granite cap above the doors . Inside , a municipal room : flaking gray paint , the fume of disinfectant rising from the wood floor . A few people scattered about , looking like dark bundles forgotten on the high-backed benches . At the front of the room , a counter topped with frosted-glass panels . Casson could see the shadows of clerks , walking back and forth . He took a brass token from a gardien at the door and found an empty bench in the back of the room . An official appeared at the wire grille that covered the cashier 's window . He cleared his throat and called out , " Number eighty-one . " A woman stood up . " Yes , sir . " " Will you take thirty francs ? " " Monsieur ! Thirty francs --  ? " This was as much argument as he cared to listen to . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out onto the counter . " Well , " the woman said . A change of heart , she would take whatever they offered . " Too late , madame . " The voice polite but firm . Really , he would not be subjected to the whims of these people . " So then , eighty-two ? Eighty-two . " A bearded man carrying a copper saucepot shuffled toward the counter . Casson began to worry about the overcoat -- unrolled it , tried , surreptitiously , to fluff it up a little so it did n't look so much like a bundle of dirty rags . Remember , he told himself , it 's important to make a good impression , confidence is everything . A fine coat ! Cosy for winter . God he was hungry . He had to have fifty francs from this coat . He stared up at the lights , yellow globes with shimmering halos , it hurt to look at them . He closed his eyes for a moment , the back of the wooden bench in front of him banged him in the forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see the cops , you better wake up . " Casson shook his head . Apparently he 'd fainted . " I 'm all right , " he said . " No sleeping allowed . " A hard voice , Casson turned to see who it was . A man perhaps in middle age , not so easy to say because one side of his face had been burned , skin dead white in some places , shiny pink in others . In an attempt to hide the damage he 'd let his hair grow long and it hung lank just above a knob of remaining ear . " Ca va ? " he said . " Yes . " " Done this before ? " " No . " " Well , if you do n't mind advice , you 'll get more out of them if you wait until the afternoon . After they 've had their lunch and their little glass of wine . That 's the only time to do business with the government . " Casson nodded . " I 'm Lazenac . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casson shook it . It was like gripping a rough-finish board . " Let 's go somewhere else , " Lazenac said . " This place ... " Deeper into the Marais . Paper-white men in black coats , women who kept their eyes lowered . To a tiny caf in what had been a store . Lazenac ordered a flask of Malaga , cheap red wine , and black bread . " It 's good strength , " he told Casson . Whatever that meant it was true . The sour wine jolted him back to life . Chased down with a chunk of the mealy bread it made him feel warm . " Do n't mind the neighborhood , do you ? " " No . " " Funny thing , since I had my face blown up I like the Jews . " " What happened ? " " Just the war . Chemin des Dames at Verdun -- the second time we tried it , November of ' 16 . My corporal got hit , I turned to see if I could do anything and one of those fucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , so I suppose I should be grateful . " He paused for a sip of wine . " Were you in that ? " " With a film unit , " Casson said . " Air reconnaissance . " From Lazenac , a certain kind of smile -- the fix is in . " Sweet job , " he said . Casson shrugged . " It was n't my idea . I just signed up , they told me where to go . " " Way of the world , if you do n't mind my saying that . " " No , I do n't mind . " Lazenac stared out the window . " I 'm not so bad off . With the girls , it 's okay as long as you do n't ask them to touch it . And I have to keep the conversation on my good side . But then , my grampa did that for twenty years . " They both laughed . Lazenac poured some more wine in Casson 's glass . " Go ahead , it 's the only way to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass . " Thank you , " he said . Lazenac shrugged it off . " Do n't bother . I 'm rich today , tomorrow it 's your turn . " He looked around the little room . A very old man in a yarmulke turned the page of his newspaper , squinting to see the print at the top of the column . " The worst of it is , " Lazenac said . He paused , shook his head . " Well , what happened to me really did n't matter , if you see what I mean . " " Because , in June of ' 40 , they got what they came for the first time . " " Yes . " " Maybe it is n't forever , " Casson said . " No . It ca n't be . Of course , we both know people who 'd like to ignore the whole thing -- just try to get along with them . But you know the saying , le plus on leur baise le cul , le plus ils nous chient sur la tte . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they shit on your head . " Some people used to say that even before the war , " Casson said . Lazenac nodded . " Yes , " he said . " Now and then they did . " He poured himself some more wine . " Where are you from , Marin ? " " Paris . " " I can hear that , but one of the bons quartiers , right ? " " Yes . " " So what are you doing down here ? " " No money . " " No friends ? " Casson shrugged and smiled . Of course he had friends and some of them -- one or two of them anyhow -- would have helped . But if he went anywhere near his old life he was finished , and so were they . " I 'm doing a job tonight , " Lazenac said . " We 're going to take something from the Germans and sell it . There are three or four of us , but we can always use one more . I 'm not sure about the money but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it ? " " All right . " " We 'll meet at the porte de la Chapelle freight yards , the rue Albon bridge , about eight . Have a shave , and give your jacket a brush . " Casson nodded . Was Lazenac just being kind ? " Some of the people we talk to , maybe you can do a better job than we can . Want to try it ? " Casson said he did . " Number one hundred and thirty-eight . " By now the room was warm , a fly buzzing against the grimy window . Casson walked up to the counter , eyes down . The clerk behind the grilled window had a small face , pink scalp , the eyes of a terrier . He looked at Casson a moment longer than he needed to . Well well . Casson slid the coat across the polished counter . No rueful smiles , no jokes . The urge was powerful but he fought it off . He trudged back to the wooden bench , let his mind wander , tried not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and thirty-eight ? " Casson stood . " Monsieur , will you take a hundred and eighty francs ? " What ? " Yes , " he said , headed for the counter before they came to their senses . What in the name of heaven -- maybe the thing actually had value . His wife , Marie-Claire -- they 'd been separated for years -- used to suspect the little paintings they bought at the flea markets were lost masterpieces . You do n't know , Jean-Claude , poor Czanne may have paid his laundress with this , see how the pear reflects the light . But a coat ? Was it llama , chamois , something exotic ? The clerk pulled a pin from the corner of a packet of ten-franc notes and , using a practiced thumb and forefinger , snapped eighteen of them into a pile . As he slid the money and the pawn ticket across the counter his eyes met Casson 's : a sad day for us , monsieur , when a gentleman of our class is forced to pawn his overcoat . Outside , Lazenac was leaning against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go have , a little something , " Casson said . Another liter of Malaga , then he headed back to Clichy . He would eat . A bistro around the corner from his hotel had fried potatoes and the smell drove him crazy every time he went past . With the dinner you got a piece of stewed chicken , called coquelet , a polite way of saying the rooster got old and died . Shit , he thought , I 'm rich . He could pay a week on his hotel , sixty francs , and thirty for a meal . And then there was Lazenac 's " job " out at the porte de la Chapelle . If he did n't get thrown in jail , he 'd have even more . From there , he went on to become one of the wealthiest men in Europe , and today , his portrait hangs in every lyce in France , this beloved entrepreneur who -- Oh the Malaga . He had n't felt this good for a long time . In July , on the run from the Germans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love was hardly enough of a word for it -- had driven him back to France . Pure madness , a folie de jeunesse at the age of forty-two , and he 'd gotten just what he deserved . Because , when he went looking for her , she was gone . Why ? He did n't know . She had n't been arrested , and she had n't fled in the middle of the night . She had packed her bags and paid her bill and left the hotel . Fin , like the end of a movie . June 1941 , off the Normandy coast , just at the moment of escape , as the fishing boat turned toward England , he had jumped into the sea and swum for the shore , British special operatives waving their Stens and calling him names . Walking all night , he 'd made his way to a cottage he owned at the edge of Deauville , rented to an oil-company lawyer and his wife . But they were gone and the Germans had fixed lead seals to the doors , with tags stating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been declared off-limits to civilians . Too bad , but maybe it did n't matter . He 'd had a thousand francs , faked papers , and love in his heart . Had crossed the line into the Zone Non-Occupe , the ZNO , then south to Lyons , then up the hill to " their " hotel . Then , a clerk : " I 'm sorry , monsieur .... " She had gone . No mistake in identity possible , she was well known ; the film actress called Citrine , not a star exactly but certainly not somebody who could simply fade away . She was just -- gone . Did she know he had escaped the Germans ? Did she panic when he disappeared ? Had she simply fallen in love with somebody else ? He did n't think so , but what he did know was that with her -- a life of highs , lows , tears , chaos -- anything was possible . He survived it -- maybe he survived it . Wandered north for a time , to Bourges , to Orlans , to Nantes . Where he 'd been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now a dangerous thing -- just waking up in these places felt wrong . So he came home to Paris to die . He was tired , sat on a bench in a little park . A woman strolled over , gave him a look . He shrugged -- sorry , I 'd like to , but I ca n't afford it . She was heavy and matronly , like the headmistress in a school . Fine theatre to be had there , he thought . " Maybe next time , " he said . She looked sad , went off down the street . The sun was low , orange flame in a puddle of dirty water on the cobblestones . What was it , Friday ? Maybe . September -- he was sure of that , anyhow . He should have asked how much , maybe they could have struck a deal . 8:10 P.M. Porte de la Chapelle freight yards . Casson stood on a pedestrian bridge above the tracks . Rails crisscrossed into the distance , a dull sheen in the last of the twilight . Below him , a train of empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A long whistle echoed off the hillside , a cloud of brown smoke drifted over the tarred beams of the bridge . From where he stood he could see Lazenac and his friends , gray shadows in workers ' clothing , heads down , hands in pockets . At the end of the bridge Lazenac introduced him to Raton -- small and wiry , with sharp eyes and a clever smile -- and Victor . He was simply Jean . They walked east , along the edge of the yards . Not taking it easy , exactly , but not in any hurry ; going to work , there 'd still be plenty left when they got there . Across the street , a row of warehouses , rusty iron gates chained shut . As they passed an alley , Lazenac made a small motion with his hand , a truck 's engine sputtered to life and backed away , deeper into the shadows . Another hundred meters and they reached the main entry to the railyards : a striped barrier bar lowered across the road , an Alsatian shepherd in the alert prone position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said anything , nobody 's eyes met , but the feeling was like Friday night in a workers ' bar -- the fight had to happen , the only question was when . Five minutes later , well out of sight of the guards , they stopped by a wall . Ten feet high , old plaster cracked and peeling . Two handmade ladders lay flat in the weeds . Raton and Victor set one of them against the wall and braced the bottom . Lazenac climbed to the top , took the second ladder as it was handed up , and lowered it carefully down the other side of the wall . He put one foot across , then shifted his weight gracefully and stood on the second ladder . " You 're next , " he called to Casson in a stage whisper . Casson worked his way up the awful thing -- barely wide enough to get a foot on each rung . He was scared now , not so much of the Germans , but of being asked to do something he would n't be able to do . As he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . " A moment later he saw why : broken glass -- wine bottles had been cemented into the cap of the wall . Casson took a deep breath , got one foot over , balanced , then swung across . He did it wrong -- he knew it an instant before it happened -- and began his backward tumble to the ground . Only he did n't fall , because Lazenac saw it coming , reached up and grabbed him by the belt and forced his weight back on the ladder . " Merci bien , " Casson said , breathing hard . " Je vous en prie . " On the other side of the wall , Casson knelt by some kind of storm sewer , the open end of a drainage culvert . Over time , the outflow had cut itself a channel , some three feet deep , into the hillside . When the others were down the ladder , Lazenac led them single file , crouched low , along the gulley . " Stay close to the ground , " Raton whispered to him . " If the schleuh catch you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foot of the hill , they waited . A busy night : in the distance , the sound of yard engines chugging up and down the tracks , and the steel clash of boxcars being coupled . Directly in front of them were flatbed cars stacked with peeled logs , probably cut in the forests of the Massif Central and now en route to Germany . After what seemed to Casson like a long time , the red glow of a track lantern moved toward them and Lazenac said , " At last , the cheminots . " Railwaymen . There were two of them . They shook hands all around , then the one with the lantern said , " It 's about two hundred meters up ahead . Third track in . " " An SNCF car , " the other said . " 7112 . " " All right , " Lazenac said . " We 're on our way . " " Keep an eye out for the yard security . " " Thanks for everything , we 'll settle up on the weekend -- same as before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yeah , " Lazenac said . They both laughed . The lantern faded away down the track , Lazenac led them in the other direction . Casually , without stealth -- every right to be here . The SNCF car stood high above its cast-iron wheels . A wire seal secured the door handle . From inside his jacket Lazenac produced an iron bar about two feet long . He worked it through the loop and put his weight on it until the wire snapped . Standing on the metal rungs beside the door , he pushed it open and ran the beam of a flashlight up and down the stacked cargo . Cotton sacks piled to the ceiling , stenciled with the name of the company and the label SUCRE DE CANNE . Sugar . Lazenac swung inside and reappeared a moment later carrying a sack . Victor stood below him . Lazenac dropped the sack on Victor 's shoulder and Victor then headed back toward the hillside . Casson was next . " Do n't worry , " Lazenac said . " You 're stronger than you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sack into the air and lowered it onto Casson 's shoulder . Casson felt his knees buckle and said " Merde " under his breath . Raton , leaning against the freight car , laughed , then patted him on the arm . He moved off , swaying at every step , but he was n't going to fail . Up ahead , Victor was plodding along at a steady pace . Casson went about ten steps , then , the sour voice of authority : " All right --  just where do you think you 're going with that ? " Casson turned to look . Some kind of railroad guard -- an official armband , a whistle . He was tapping his palm with a long , wooden bton blanc , a policeman 's club . " Put it down , you , " he said to Casson . I 'll never be able to pick it up again . Lazenac leaned out of the open doorway and rapped the man on the head with the iron bar . For a moment there was dead silence . " More ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd been hit . " Are you crazy ? " He grabbed the silver whistle around his neck and put it to his lips . Raton kicked him in the stomach and he folded in half . Lazenac jumped down off the boxcar and tore the whistle off his neck , then the two of them beat him senseless . When he lay full length on the cinders and did n't move , Casson adjusted the sack on his shoulder as best he could and headed for the wall . Somehow , he got himself up the ladder . How he did it he would never know , but he reached the top , using both hands to haul himself up a rung at a time . When he stopped to rest , panting like an engine , he discovered that Victor was waiting for him at the top of the ladder on the other side . " Now , just lift it across -- I 'll help you -- and try not to break the glass . " Casson looked puzzled . " Why let them know how we did it ? There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might want to get into a railyard . " The truck was waiting for them a little way up the street . A small Citron delivery van -- camionette -- with a shutter in the back instead of doors and the name of a bakery painted on the side . Victor rolled the shutter up and tossed his sack in . Casson did the same -- secretly very proud of himself when the weight made the truck bounce on its springs . A minute later , Lazenac and Raton showed up . " You know where you 're going ? " Lazenac asked the driver . " The rue Hennequin . In the seventeenth . " " Out by the Ternes Mtro . " " What 's it called ? " " Ma Petite Auberge . " The driver snickered -- my little country inn . " Mon petit cul , " he said . My little backside . Lazenac laughed . " Well , when you have a restaurant , that 's what you 'll call it . " He leaned into the cab of the truck and said , " Keep a cool head , Michot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circus . " " We 'll be fine . " Casson and Lazenac rode the Mtro out to the 17th . It was sad on the train . Before the war , that time of night , there would have been waiters going home in their black jackets and white aprons , lovers who could n't wait to get into bed , and the strange old birds one always saw -- Sanskrit professors , stamp collectors -- going out to eat cassoulet or heading up to Montmartre to give the girls a bad time . Now , people stared at the floor , their spirit broken . " For us , " Lazenac said , " getting hold of the stuff is the easy part . " " I 'll do what I can , " Casson said . " What 's the price ? " " Oh , maybe three hundred francs a kilo -- but not for the quantity we 've got . Tonight we 'll try to sell a hundred kilos . " " So , two fifty ? " " Tiens ! " Lazenac said with a grin -- would n't that be nice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the empty station . Casson smoothed his lapels , trying to make them lie flat . His face burned like fire , he 'd shaved close , using a three-month-old razor blade . Cleaned his shoes with a rag , borrowed a tie from the old man down the hall , and that was about the best he could do . At least , he thought , looking down at his feet , his socks were still in decent shape . It was the socks that went first . A whore he knew said she only took customers whose socks were in good condition . One of Casson 's fellow lodgers had shown him how he used a pen to color in the skin that showed white in the holes . Lazenac dropped a heavy hand on his shoulder . " Do n't worry too much , " he said , as though reading Casson 's thoughts . " It 's all in your face -- who you are . " " Once upon a time , maybe , but now ... " Lazenac smiled , only one side of it really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life 's not like that . " 10:30 in the evening in the rue Hennequin . Some restaurants lived secret lives , others spread out into their streets . This was the second kind ; a green-and-gold faade , a line of handsome automobiles . A Horch , a Lancia Aprilia . In the back seat of an open sedan , a redhead with a dead fox around her neck was smoking like a movie star . On the street : German officers in shiny leather , boots and belts and straps ; their girlfriends , wearing plenty of rouge and eye shadow and black stockings ; and the strange tidal debris -- the Count of Somewhere , Somebody the art dealer -- that flowed into conquered cities . " We go around the back , " Lazenac said . Down the alley the door to the kitchen was propped open with a chair . The air was thick with clouds of garlicky steam , frying fat , old grease , and lye soap . Lazenac spoke to one of the cooks and a waiter appeared a moment later . " Oh , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have something for us ? " " Sugar , " Casson said . " As much as you like . " Their eyes met , the waiter stared at him . " The patron around ? " Casson said . " I 'm the one you see . " " Maybe we 'll come back when he 's around . " " Do n't be smart . " " Thursday ? How would that be ? " " Now look --  " " Au revoir . " It took a minute for the waiter to run off and get the owner . A true beauf , Casson thought -- from beau-frre , brother-in-law . Stocky and pink and mean . He framed himself in the doorway and put his hands on his hips . " So , what 's the big problem ? " " No problem , " Casson said . " What 's the price for sugar tonight ? " " I do n't know . What do you want ? " " Lebec is offering two fifty . And next week we 'll have butter . " " Butter . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A hundred kilos . " " Hmm . That 's , ah , twenty-five thousand francs . " " That 's what Lebec said . " " Then go see Lebec . " " If you like . " " No , wait a minute , I 'm only kidding . Save yourself the Mtro ticket -- I 'll give you twenty-two five for the whole thing . That 's fair , is n't it ? " " How about twenty-three . C'm on , be a good guy . " " You 're taking advantage of my good nature , you know . " " I know . But , what the hell . " " All right . Where is it ? " " Out in front . " " Have them bring it around . " Le Diable Vert . Midnight . Twelve hundred francs ! In times gone by he 'd spent more than that on a suit , but life changed , did n't it , and by moonlight mathematics he was richer than he 'd ever been . And , oddly enough , people -- some people anyhow -- seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistles , coats thrown open from every doorway on the rue Moncey -- but it was their vocation to see into men 's souls and on the way they would naturally stop to count what was in their pockets . Le Diable Vert . He 'd always liked a good hellhole and it was surely that . A tiny bistro , set a half-story below the street , through the open door of which he could see feet hurrying through the rain . Diable Vert -- a leering green devil with a pitchfork and a splendid tail on a sign that swung on its chains and creaked in the wind . Ten tables , brick floor cured in wine , a sign by the cash register had a photograph of a funeral and the legend LE CRDIT EST MORT . And , packed in , wall-to-wall , what seemed like the whole neighborhood -- laughing , shouting , arguing , and knocking back half-liters in a dense fog of cigarette smoke . Twelve hundred francs . So the death of credit was no problem for Casson -- not tonight . Tonight he was the local sultan . Lazenac had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchant bankers Casson used to deal with in the movie business . The twenty-three thousand francs was to be split with the railwaymen , the remainder shared out by Lazenac and his crew . The man who drove the camionette received a share , and so did his van , that was traditional . Then there was a handsome slice carved out for a certain Monsieur X , nameless but clearly important . " Marin , may I join you ? " It was a man named Bruc . Casson was n't sure exactly what he did , but he worked nights and headed for the Mtro wearing green rubber boots . " Please , " Casson said . Bruc took the empty chair , Casson filled his glass and offered him a packet of Gauloises Bleues , a luxury in that part of town . Bruc drew a cigarette from the pack with care , holding it in his mouth with thumb and forefinger while Casson struck a match and lit it for him . " Thank you very much , Marin , " he said formally . The crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform -- satin shirts , suspenders holding up wool trousers , and tweed workers ' caps -- gave Casson a glance over the shoulder . " My night off , " Bruc said . " I like to be where people are . " " What 's your work ? " Casson asked . " I 'm part of the crew on a pumper truck . Out in the old quarters on the edge of the city . We pump out the cesspools . " " I thought it all went in the sewers . " " No . Not out there it does n't . Some nights we do apartment houses , some nights the office buildings . They take a lot longer . " " Really ? " " Oh yes , a lot longer . " Bruc took a sip of wine and a long drag on his Gauloise . A man had jumped up on a table and started to sing , people were clapping to keep time . " Why does it take longer ? " Casson said . " Well , the cesspools are the same size , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell to pump out . " Casson stared . A peculiarity of office life ? The owner worked his way through the crowd , a full chopine in his hand . He poured the last of the old flask into the two glasses . " You 'll take a little more ? " he asked Casson . " Yes , " Casson said . " Certainly we will . " " Generous of you , " Bruc said . " Monsieur Bruc , " Casson said . " How is it different ? " " The water , monsieur . In the apartment buildings they are forever cooking and cleaning and washing the laundry . " Casson wandered out the back door to a courtyard , unbuttoned his fly , and stood over an open drain . Drinking all day , he thought . Well , so what ? Above him , a fine starry night ; with the city under a blackout the sky had returned . Autumn heaven -- les Poissons up there somewhere , his birth sign . Somebody had once tried to show it to him , but all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late . Up in Passy , his former life went on . Marie-Claire and Bruno , the Arnauds and the Pichards , would be chattering over after-dinner drinks . Good talk , witty and dry -- life was irony . No doubt they would be talking about the **26;329;TOOLONG . Not so affreux , of course , that one refused to get rich off them . Maybe they talked about the war , maybe not . Like any other inconvenience , it would go away when it was ready . In the meantime , x was broke , y was sleeping with z . Then , a glance at a watch , kisses all around , and home they 'd go . Home , where they hung their clothes on quilted hangers in closets with mirrored doors . Home , to bed . Casson fumbled at his fly , getting the buttons done . Jean-Claude , you are drunk . Well , yes , I am , it 's true . But I have a theory about that , if you 'd like to hear it . I believe it may result from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vinkelmeister in his paper read before the Acadmie Nationale . Casson laughed out loud . Doctor Vinkelmeister . Back in the Diable Vert it got louder and louder . Monsieur Bruc had wandered off somewhere . The man who had jumped on a table to sing a song was now crawling around on hands and knees and barking like a dog . People shouted at him , " Down , Fideaux ! Roll over ! Shake hands ! " Two men wearing sharp suits came to Casson 's table . Brothers , he thought . They had the same face . Thick shoulders , heavy throats , chins dark only hours after shaving . Casson could smell the hair oil . Pimps . From the south , he thought , the Midi . Come up to Paris to make their fortunes . " Wo n't you offer us a drink ? " This one was fatter than the other and wore an expensive black shirt . Of course . With pleasure . They were sniffing at him . And the drink was n't optional . The fat one took the flask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See ? " he said to his brother . " I told you he was a good guy . " He was glad when they left . The dance-hall girls came back . The dark one with curly hair dropped into the empty chair and said , " What a crowd ! " " Et alors , " her friend said , hands on hips , playfully indignant . " Kind of you to take the chair . " " Do n't mention it . I could tell you wanted me to have it . " " Well . " She looked around , then shrugged and settled herself delicately on Casson 's lap . " With your permission , monsieur . " " More than welcome . " " There , you see ? " she said to her friend . " Some people still know how to be polite . " Then , formally , to Casson : " How are you called , monsieur ? " " Marin , " He said . " Jean Marin . " " I am -- Julie . " As with all English names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft , the accent rolling to the second syllable : Ju-lee . She caressed the name as she said it , clearly relishing the identity it suggested . Who are you really , he thought . Juliette , at best . More likely : Hortense . From some wretched little village somewhere . Ran off to Paris , leaving Albert the butcher 's son heartbroken . He could see why . She was one of those lethal girls , with the small face and the big ass , white skin , angelic pout . The hair pinned up under her cap was a strange shade of red , God only knew what had been done to it in various hotel sinks . She wriggled around to get comfortable , then settled in -- a warm vee against his thigh -- gave him a playful nip on the earlobe and made a brat face . Bit you ! The friend looked grim and shook her head in mock despair -- oh that Julie . She rooted around in her purse , found a small mirror , and went to work repairing the kiss curl on her forehead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hair until it was plastered against her skin . For no particular reason that Casson could see , this operation was accompanied by a fierce scowl . Julie hummed to herself , took Casson 's glass and finished his wine . He pulled her against him and gave her a kiss . " Mm , " she said , against his mouth . He could smell her lipstick , waxy and sweet . Big , heavy kisses , she moved her head from side to side , arms tight around his neck . He was fifteen again . She drew back and said " Tiens , " hanging on to her cap so it would n't blow away in the big storm they were brewing up . Casson laughed , then fished a handful of francs from his shirt pocket . " Another chopine , I think . " " Let me , " she said , taking the money from his hand . He watched her as she moved through the crowd , richly curved in her thin wool trousers . The din grew , and grew again -- in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one corner began the Marseillaise , a crowd of men across the room tried the one about the Breton housewife , her underdrawers eaten by a bull . The man who was a dog stuck his head out from beneath a table and bit somebody on the ankle . A tray of glasses smashed , a woman shrieked with laughter , a man shouted at a friend that only he could see . In the middle of it , Casson brooded . Where , where ? He 'd seen a tiny storeroom off the corridor that led to the courtyard , that was one possibility . Ju-lee , bent over a plank table , pants around her ankles . Primitive , but not such a bad idea . Or , maybe , actually on the table . No , that was to invite comedy . In his room ? Easily the best solution , but La Patronne would be guarding the hotel door . So , was there another way ? Yes . Pay . This was double occupancy , not the end of the world . Ah , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What if she asked for money ? No , it was n't like that . Or , at least , not quite like that . She returned with the wine , sat down again on his lap , and ruffled his hair . At some point she had put on more perfume . Casson refilled their glasses , Julie raised hers in a toast . " Mud in their eyes , " she said in English . Like a rocket on Bastille Day , the Friday-night mood . It climbed to the top of the sky , slowed , froze a long instant at the apogee , then burst , a thousand stars floating back to earth . For a time , the crowd in the Diable Vert felt good . Oh , maybe the last few years had n't gone so well but it was n't really their fault . Now everything was going to be different , they could see it , around the next bend in life . Justice at last , their rightful place , finally some money . Then the moment passed . They remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to them -- the same things that happened to everybody they 'd ever known . So , fuck this life they handed me . A little more wine , anyhow , you could n't go too far wrong with that . Casson felt it coming . Arguments , tears , fights , somebody sick in the middle of it . He pulled the girl against him , clung to her . A moment of surprise , then she put her arms around him and held him tight . Her back was damp beneath the satin shirt . " Maybe it 's time for us to go , " he said . He felt her nod against his shoulder . " Just across the square , " he said . " The hotel where I stay . " Again she nodded . Cold outside , but the air felt good after the bistro . She took his arm as they walked . Clichy was busy and raucous , the Paris night rolling along toward the dawn . A fat man with a wildly rouged woman came down the street . He tipped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are with our girls and what fine fellows we are . Casson gave him a nod and a smile . Then , panic . Did the man actually know him ? Old somebody he 'd once met at the somethings ' house ? Julie squeezed his arm . " Look at the moon , " she said . Half a white disc just north of the river . From a dance hall on the other side of the square , le swing jazz , a trumpet , a saxophone , a spill of yellow light from the open door , then darkness . Behind them , a man laughed . " The lovebirds . " " Coucou . " Casson turned his head halfway , the two men from the bar , about ten feet behind them . " Just ignore them , " Julie said . " Gonzesse . " Cunt . Half a block . They walked quickly despite themselves . Then a turn into the side street and the Hotel Victoria . The men came up close , the one in the black shirt put a hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a talk , " he said , voice low and charged . Casson pulled away . " Leave us alone , " he said . It was the other one who hit him first , threw Julie out of his way and punched him in the side of the head . Julie screamed , Casson found himself on one knee . Was it even possible he 'd been hit that hard ? One side of his face had gone dead . Black-Shirt kicked him -- meant to kick him in the head but hit his shoulder , spun him halfway around , and he fell on his back . Julie started to scream again but Black-Shirt said , " Shut up or we 'll cut your face , " and she was silent . Casson tried to stand up , got to his knees but that was the best he could do . He felt hands going through his pockets ; Black-Shirt was excited , breathing hard , Casson could smell sweat -- something like sweat , but much worse -- and hair oil . When the man was done he stood up , then kicked Casson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He fell forward , tried to roll up to protect himself , saw the two men walking away , back toward place Clichy . Julie knelt by his side , touched his face , her hand was trembling . She took a tiny handkerchief from her purse and held it against his mouth . There were blood drops on the pavement . " No police . " He tried to say it but it came out a mumble . " Your mouth is hurt , " she said . Somehow he got up . Very shaky , but on his feet . He had to get off the street . She took his arm , helped him walk . In the lobby of the hotel , a night clerk was behind the counter . " I 'm taking him to his room , " Julie said . The clerk hesitated a moment , then said , " The patronne comes in at eight -- just be out before then . " They started up the stairs . Casson said , " My key . " " I have it , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He held the little handkerchief against his mouth so he did n't bleed on his shirt . She took his arm , helped him up each step . It took a long time to climb to the sixth floor . She got most of his clothes off , he fell onto the bed , faded out . He woke later , she was sitting on the bed in the dark room . He reached out , rested a hand on her knee . " Are you all right ? " he said . " Yes , " she said . But she had been crying . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " You could n't help it . " She paused a moment . " Somebody like you ... " They were quiet for a time . " They should be shot , " she said . " You know them ? " " They are always in that place . You see them next week , they 'll smile at you . Up here , nobody goes to the police , that only makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side throbbed , his face was numb . She smoothed his hair back . " Go to sleep , " she said . " I 'll be here . " He did n't want to sleep but he could n't stop it . For a few seconds he came back awake , felt how warm she was , sitting on the bed . Sometimes jagged and plummeting , sometimes about Citrine . Just before making love , when together they took her clothes off . She had once said that when a woman goes with a man , and for the first time he sees her with nothing on , that it is the best at that moment that it will ever be . Later he tried to turn in his sleep and a sharp pain under his arm woke him up . He reached out , felt nothing , opened his eyes . The first gray light of dawn was in the room and the girl was gone . An hour later , the knock on the door . " Police , open up . " My revolver , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the door , pounding down the stairs . In the lobby , the patronne , eyes wide with horror . " No ! Please ! Have mercy ! " Shots ring out in the Hotel Victoria . " I 'm coming , " he called out , struggling to stand up . There was no revolver . When he got the door open he saw it was the same flic from the day before . So , he thought , it had been his photograph after all -- he had been betrayed . By the patronne ? Somebody else ? He did n't know . " Is your name Marin ? Jean Louis ? " " Yes . " " You 're wanted for questioning . " Not arrested , not handcuffed . He thought about making a run for it , but he was too banged up -- the flic had to wait for him as he worked at getting dressed . " Let 's go , eh ? " " I 'm trying . " " Have you been fighting , Marin ? " He touched the swollen side of his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me up . " " Report the crime ? " " No . " Probably that 's a crime too , he thought . He managed to get into his jacket , looked around the room one last time . Not so bad . Now that he 'd never see it again he started to like it . In the lobby , the patronne glanced up from the register she kept on the counter , then looked down , finding an entry , holding her place with a steel finger . " Monsieur l'agent ? " she said . " Yes ? " " Is this one coming back ? " " Could n't say . " The patronne 's finger , stuck on Room 28 , began to tap . Her eyes were shining with fury . Small -- a very small victory , he thought . But likely the only one of the day . Outside , a battered Renault police car . A detective sitting in the passenger seat was reading a dossier as Casson got in the back . " You 're Marin ? " Casson nodded . Closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anything , tired , in every way you could be . Tired of his life , of clumsy deception , of the world he had to live in . Shoot me and get it over with . The old engine whined , turned over , and finally caught , missing and backfiring on the low-grade gasoline the Germans gave the police . The flic said , " To the prefecture ? " The detective turned , rested his arm on the top of the seat , and looked him over . He was an old man , heavy , with a head of thick , white hair and deep lines carved in his face . He had a big nose with a dent near the bridge and very pale blue eyes , wore an ancient black suit beneath his overcoat , a loose wool muffler , and a weather-beaten hat with the brim snapped down in front . " No . The rue Rondelet . " Casson looked out the window as the car drove off . In May of 1940 , recalled to military service , assigned to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris through the windshield of a truck . Different than the back of a taxi , he 'd thought then . Now , the same streets , from the window of a police car . Blood will tell . It was a deep Gallic conviction , especially among women over forty . Casson 's father had been a rogue , and his mother had been employed full-time as the wife of a rogue : long-suffering , humiliated by unpaid butchers , terrified of the phone . But , often enough , his father 's shield . Casson pre had more than once been spared by creditors who could not bear to hurt " his poor wife . " Wealth had always been just around the corner ; shares in Venezuelan lead mines , a scheme to import herring from Peru , a powder that kept lettuce from spoiling , tonics , treasure maps , mechanical pens . And , late in life , one honorable and very productive venture -- a wool brokerage -- which he 'd been done out of by men he called " licensed thieves who work in paneled offices . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district with a small poste de police . Not the kind of place Parisian detectives usually worked . " Go back to the prefecture , " the detective told his driver . " If anyone asks , tell them I 'll be in later . " The flic touched the visor of his cap with two fingers and drove off . Inside the station , a desk sergeant wearing a knitted green sweater under his uniform jacket greeted the detective like an old friend . Upstairs , a small office used for interrogation -- two chairs , a desk scarred with cigarette burns , tall windows opaque with dirt , a floor of narrow boards . The station backed up to a schoolyard , it was recess , and Casson could hear the kids , playing tag and yelling . The detective leaned on his elbows and read the dossier , now and then shaking his head . " Casson , Casson , " he said at last , with a sigh in his voice . Casson flinched despite himself . The detective seemed not to notice . He turned the pages slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up and said , " You 're not going to insist on this Marin business , are you ? " " No . " " Grce Dieu -- I already fought with my wife this morning . " " Will you turn me over to the Germans ? " " Worse than that , Casson , worse than that . " The detective read further . " Here 's your concierge , " he said . " Kindly old Madame Fitou , in 1933 . Hmm . Secret doings , something buried in the cellar . " " What ? " " That 's what it says here . Imagine , a man like you , a cat murderer . " " It 's madness , monsieur . " " So , you deny it ! Seems there was quite a ring operating back then . In league with the neighborhood baker , I see . And the priest . " " She really said such things ? " " And more . You do n't believe , I hope , that these women can actually live on what the tenants pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning pages of handwritten paragraphs . " 1937 . Some considerable entertaining . Anglique , Franoise , Madame de Levallier . " He squared the stack of pages with his palms and closed the folder . " What will happen to me ? " Casson said . The detective shook his head -- God only knows . " When I started to look for you , it gave me an excuse to see a movie or two . I must tell you that your policemen are a disgrace . Venal , brutal , and , worst of all , stupid . And when they shoot they do n't hit anything . " " It 's just the movies . " The detective leaned forward in his chair and spoke quietly . " Tell me , Casson , why did you come back to France ? " " A woman . " The detective nodded . " Not patriotism ? " " No , monsieur . " The detective smiled -- somebody had told the truth ! He glanced at his watch , went to a window , took the brass handles and shoved it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and listen , Casson . It 's the latest thing from Vichy -- a hymn to Ptain . " Casson went to the window . Down in the schoolyard , the children -- eight- and nine-year-olds -- were lined up in rows . Facing them , a music teacher , conducting with a stern finger : " And one , and two , and ... " They sang with high voices , an angels ' choir . All the children who love you and hold your years dear to your supreme call have answered smartly , " Here ! " Marshal , here are we before you , 0 savior of France . We your little buddies swear to follow where you advance . For France is Ptain , and Ptain is France . They began the next song , the detective closed the window , then went to the door and started to open it , giving Casson a nod of the head that meant let 's go . " Well , Casson , " he said , " perhaps you 're in luck . You may not have found patriotism , but it appears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
