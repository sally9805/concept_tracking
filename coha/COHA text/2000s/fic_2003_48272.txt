1 September <p> There was nothing outside our town to warn you of its coming . One second you were n't there and the next you were . It was more than a post office and more than a village , but it had no sprawl , it had no outskirts . The town huddled close together for protection , the desert everyone loved promising to kill any stray . There , on spring afternoons and evenings when the dropping sun washed the sky pink , my friend Errol , a Kiowa Indian , and I would go out into the countryside and follow the tracks of coyotes . We saw the animals frequently and in the course of watching them had discovered several dens in the hills south of town . We dreamed of finding a lion 's den , but never even saw a lion . The coyotes must have known we were there , staring at them from adjacent ridges through our fathers ' field glasses , but the coyotes never seemed to care , casually letting their pups out to play in the cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting behind a boulder and watching two coyotes at the waterhole . The clouds that had formed above the mountains to the east never came closer and we could see that it was raining over there . Another coyote appeared suddenly , strolled close , and then attacked the male , biting at its hind legs and drawing blood immediately . The wounded animal yelped but did n't retreat , the crimson soaking through his fur . Our eyes were pressed hard against the rubber cups of our glasses ' eyepieces . <p> " Did you see that ? " I asked Errol . I could tell by the way he did n't answer that he had . <p> The animals launched into each other again and if not for the stream of blood from the one 's leg we would have been unable to tell them apart . While they tore at each other , the third coyote remained uninvolved and actually seemed to enjoy her drink from the hole . Bites yielded yelps and even though we were some seventy yards away we could hear the growling and snarling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bloody hip . I could see its chest heaving with difficult breaths . The attacking coyote trotted off and soon the female followed . <p> " Is he dying ? " Errol asked . <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " What should we do ? " <p> " What can we do ? " We studied for another minute or so . " Let 's get closer . " I looked at Errol and saw that he was unsure . " Not too close , just closer . " <p> In order to get closer , however , we had to climb down a steep slope covered with loose pebbles and for a second the waterhole was out of our view . When we could see it again the injured animal was gone . <p> " I want to see the spot where he was on the ground , " I said . <p> " Why ? " <p> " I want to see if he left any blood . " <p> " That 's crazy . " Errol stuffed his binoculars back into its case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's the big deal about coyote blood ? " <p> " I just want to see it , that 's all . " <p> So we walked through the prickly pears and purslane to the waterhole and there it was , on the sand by the water and some of it on a bleached piece of wood , the blood of the coyote . It was everything I hoped it would be , real . <p> 1 September <p> Errol and I spent most of the afternoon packing the gear for the camping trip we would be taking with our fathers into the mountains north of Taos . It was not even fall yet , but there had already been snow up in Wyoming and Colorado and so we knew that the nights could be very cold . I was eager to try out the new sleeping bag my father had bought me . I pulled the blue bag out of its teal vinyl sack and let Errol feel the thickness of the fiber fill . He said something about maybe it being too heavy and it crossed my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " I said , " I 'm getting pretty big now . I think I can manage it . " It was an unintentional comment on his size ; I knew that it bothered him that I had shot up a couple of inches over the summer while he had remained the same height . I felt immediately guilty for having said it and I tried to gloss over it by saying , " You might be right , though . Some of the trails are mighty steep . " <p> " Yeah , well , I can take the cold , " he said . <p> We cleaned off the camp stove and closed it , rolled the bottles of white gas up in a couple of thick towels . <p> " My father says he 's sure we 'll see a lion this year , " Errol said . <p> " A lion ? " The idea excited me . <p> " He said there is much talk of a cat around Questa . He said it killed a bunch of sheep and a dog , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " My father said if we find some sign we 'll track it and then we can see it . " <p> " That would be something , " I said , even though his talking was sounding like bragging , but I was more interested in the cat . I genuinely hoped his father could track the thing . <p> " Kiowa are great trackers , " Errol said . <p> " I know . " <p> 1 September <p> After Errol went home that night I sat in the den where my mother and father were playing gin . They sat on the sofa and used the coffee table for the cards and I sat on the floor in front of the television and watched some kind of spy movie . My mother was wearing a yellow dress with red flowers on it and her hair was pulled back , showing her round face and its delicate features , her full lips painted red against her brown skin . Looking at her made me happy and I felt warm , being full of the roast beef dinner we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sounded like she was winning and my father pretended to be bothered by it all , but I could tell he was n't . In the movie a man was chasing his double , a man who looked just like him except that he had a scar on his chest . They were on a train and the bad guy kept making everyone think he was the good guy and doing and saying rotten stuff so that they all came to hate the good guy . My mother told my father that she was going to miss us while we were up in the mountains and said she wanted us to be careful . My father and I told her we would be and when I turned back to the television the train had wrecked and I did n't know which spy was the good one . <p> 1 September <p> My mother was a stalwart believer that breakfast was the most important meal of the day and especially today as we were setting out for the wilderness she fed us well . We had oatmeal and eggs and pancakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistled out a breath and said something about the government that neither I nor my mother heard and then put down the paper . <p> " So , we should be back early on Thursday , " he said and then shoveled in a spoonful of oatmeal . <p> My mother looked at me . " You be sure to change your underwear . I know how you boys get out there . And brush your teeth . " <p> " Yes , ma'am . " <p> The sun was pouring in through the window over the sink and the zinnias my mother had cut and brought in from the garden were glowing . My father was wearing his favorite flannel shirt and I had on one very much like it . We tried to eat everything to please my mother . <p> We finished breakfast and loaded our gear into the Jeep Wagoneer , making sure to leave plenty of room for Errol and his father 's stuff . I petted the head of Lassie , our collie , and then we waved goodbye to my mother as we backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the gardens and picket fences and past the car-chasing terrier that lived on the corner and often slept in the middle of the street . <p> 1 September <p> The drive north and up into the mountains was beautiful . Errol and I were sitting in the back seat while our fathers talked in the front . Errol 's father , whose name was Andy , called my father by his shortened nickname , Oz . <p> " So , what do you think , Oz ? " the Kiowa man said . " Do you think this stuff down in Cuba is a real problem ? " <p> My father shrugged . " I just wish the white people could blow each other up without taking the rest of us with them . " <p> The two men laughed , but Errol and I just looked at each other . " But life is good for us out here , is n't it , Andy ? " my father asked . <p> " Yes , it is . " <p> We drove up away from the squatty junipers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of aspen . We decided to stop at the top of a hill that overlooked a clear , twisting creek which had a beaver dam . The two fathers agreed that the fishing would be good there and so we set up camp . It seemed we all sang as we collected wood for the fire , set up tents , and prepared the night 's dinner of hot dogs and baked beans from a can . I do n't remember what songs we sang , only that we sang . <p> 1 September <p> We sat around the fire after our meal and Errol 's father told us how his people used to come down and raid the Taos Indians , how some of the warriors remained to take Taos wives , how they set up a camp in Bear Canyon and lived there in the summers and in the winters moved down to stay in the pueblo , even though they were Kiowa , even though the Kiowa made periodic raids on their village . <p> The moon was full that night and was bright cornbread yellow . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched it , our heads sticking out of the tent we were sharing . Our fathers were still up and talking just yards away . <p> " I wish I was Indian like you , " I said to Errol . <p> " Why ? " <p> " I do n't know , really , " I said . " I guess I like the way your father talks about this place . Like it 's a part of him . " <p> " My grandfather told me I 'm a cat dreamer . And it 's true , I have these dreams where a cat moves right through me . I can feel it . " <p> I stared at his profile , his eyes still pointed at the sky . I wondered whether I believed him . I wanted to believe him and was jealous at the thought that it was true . " What kind of cat ? " I asked . <p> " A big one , a lion . " <p> I closed my eyes and looked for my own cat . <p> 1 September <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Errol fished the slow-moving creek below the beaver dam and I worked the expanse of flat , still water above it . It was early , the air still frigid . There was no fish-feeding activity on the surface , so I was casting terrestrials , cinnamon ants , hoppers , and elk-hair caddis flies up-current to an undercut bank . I was casting into the weeds and dragging the flies into the water with a splash , the way my father had taught me . " Ground insects always splash into the water , " my father told me . " You do n't have to cast far . It 's all presentation . Everything is presentation . " <p> A big brown took my hopper and then darted for cover around a stump in the pond . I sloshed through the knee-deep water to keep my line clear . It was a big fish , at least twenty inches . My heart was pounding . My breath was short . I could feel Errol watching me . I began to strip in line . <p> " Not too fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his warning and calmed myself . I pulled the trout closer and closer and then I could see his eye staring at me on the surface . I was standing at the bank now . I grabbed the fish , slipped out the hook and dropped it into my creel . I looked over to Errol and he waved to me , gave me the okay sign . <p> 1 September <p> We ate the fish that Errol and I caught for breakfast along with scrambled eggs made by Errol 's father . The fish were fried with the heads still on and the meat fell away from the skeletons easily . The heat of the cooking fire warmed the front of my body and a cool wind bit pleasantly into my back . <p> After breakfast , we went hiking up the mountain . We followed the creek for a couple of miles and then veered away from it , climbing to the top of a ridge . We followed the ridge up into stands of aspen trees . We got a quick glimpse of a yearling elk , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The glassy eyes did n't look real in the head . The body was ripped open and the hind legs were gone . Part of the heart was several feet away . <p> " Lion , " Errol 's father said . " Look at the claw marks and the size of the bite . " He pointed to the torn , light brown body , but I really could n't see what he was talking about . " Body 's still warm , " he said . <p> Errol and I looked about anxiously . I was both excited and terrified . I wanted to see the animal , see it close up , out there in the woods . <p> " You boys stay close , " my father said . <p> We continued on through the forest . It was a cloudy day and so the sun never really had a chance to warm things up . I zipped up my jacket and listened for noises as we walked , trying to separate the forest from the sounds of our footfalls . We made it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then we started back down . We did n't see the cat , not even further sign of it . I was disappointed . But the image of that fawn 's heart stayed with me . <p> 1 September <p> There was a lion up there . I did n't get to see it , but I was next to its kill . I saw the animal 's heart from which it had taken a bite . In my mind , the cat was gigantic , but in my calmer moments I realized that it was no bigger than a German shepherd dog . I could n't get to sleep that first night home after the camping trip . I wanted to dream about the lion and nothing else . <p> While I was awake I thought about the fact that school would be starting again very soon . A matter of days . Those last days of summer were always the sweetest . The weather was hot , but not unbearable . There were occasional afternoon showers . And after the rain , when the desert had sucked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall , I would walk with Frannie Dawes . <p> Frannie Dawes lived across the street with her mother . Her father was in and out of the VA hospital in Albuquerque . Frannie was skinny , with little feet , and she played the flute . She liked insects and so I liked her . <p> Those last days of summer were sweet . And the circus was coming . <p> 1 September <p> Frannie Dawes and I left my house with a sack lunch and my father 's binoculars . We did n't see any coyotes , but we walked a long time . We walked along the wash and watched a couple of red-tailed hawks circling and looking for prey . We stayed out until the sun was going down , just talking about this and that . I was floating , feeling happy and lost . And I wanted more than anything to kiss Frannie Dawes , to kiss her on the lips . <p> We were facing the sunset as we approached the edge of town . There was a broken band of clouds that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop walking and just look at that . " Just look at that , " she said . I did and my hand found hers . I had never been so scared in my life . I looked over at her face . She was staring at the horizon at first , but then she looked at me . I do n't know how it happened , but somehow I kissed Frannie Dawes . It was a quick kiss , our lips barely touching , but it was like a gift . Then we walked on , my heart racing around my chest . <p> 1 September <p> The cave was located south of town . Errol , Frannie , and I were there at about dusk . We waited , watching the opening from about fifty yards away . A bat flew out and into the pink sky . Then another and then a swarm . A cloud of bats , their wings grabbing the air and pushing it behind them , sounding together to make a huge scream in the night . Buzzing . My mouth was open at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I glanced over at Frannie . Her eyes were so beautiful and full of wonder and I wondered if I could ever look so beautiful to someone . Errol was standing slightly in front of us . He could n't keep still . He bounced on the balls of his feet . He was so excited by the sight . He said , " Look at that ! Would you look at that ? ! " Then he turned to look at us . Frannie had reached over and taken my hand . Errol saw our fingers tangled together . He gave my eyes a quick brush with his and then turned back to the bats . <p> " Bats ca n't see , " Errol said . " They 're blind and they have sonar , just like navy ships . Some people are afraid of them , but they wo n't hurt you . " <p> " They give me the creeps , " Frannie said and she held my hand a little tighter . <p> " That 's because you 're a girl , " Errol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , " I said . <p> " Like I said . " Errol sighed out a breath . " Come on , let 's go back to town . " <p> 1 September <p> The circus came . It came into our little town as a parade , music blaring from a marching band , and elephants stomping the street , leaving them wet with dung and the smell of the circus . We watched the clowns tumble by . We watched the ladies in the skimpy clothes ride by on horseback and we nudged each other with our elbows . We watched the man in the top hat point to us and beckon us to come . Trucks carrying the large cages with the lions and tigers rolled by us . We watched them all the way through town and out to the western edge where they set up camp . Their big tents were beautiful with the sun sinking down behind them . The sounds of the animals rode the wind into the town that night and I went to sleep listening through my open window . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleachers away from our parents at the show . Frannie sat with her mother , father , and little brother . We ate popcorn while we waited for the show to start . <p> " What is it with you and Frannie ? " Errol asked . <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " I saw you holding her hand . " <p> I was embarrassed . " So ? " <p> Errol looked back at the empty center ring . " I just saw you , that 's all . " <p> Then the lights went down and a spot came down on the ringmaster . We edged forward on our seats . He lifted his hat to us and introduced the acts and we laughed when the clowns fell and slapped each other and we gasped when the acrobats rolled through the air to be caught in the nick of time by another . And then the lion tamer came out . He was a great big man and he cracked his whip loudly . But it was the cats that captured me and I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over at him . There were two African lions and a tiger . The tiger was gigantic , much larger than I would have imagined . If the lions had been without manes , then the tiger would have dwarfed them . <p> The tamer walked confidently around the inside of the big cage . He was wearing a rhinestone-studded vest and so the huge muscles of his arms were plain for all of us to see . He cracked his whip once , twice , three times and the cats , after a brief complaint , all climbed up on their stools . The tamer shouted unintelligible commands at them with his booming voice . The low growls of the lions clawed into the crowd and I could feel the power , but the tiger was silent . When the audience was oohing and aahing over the tamer placing his head into a lion 's mouth , I looked over at the tiger and found the animal staring at me . Amber eyes fixed on me . Unmoving . <p> 1 September <p> The tiger 's eyes burned there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seeing what I was seeing . Looking at the tiger caused everything else to disappear . The tamer seemed to do all of his tricks with the lions and left the tiger to stare at me . Then the big man came to the tiger and popped his whip . The report made me jump , but the tiger did n't move a muscle . The tamer snapped the leather cord again and still there was no acknowledgement from the striped cat . The tamer looked to where the cat was looking and he saw me . He looked angry and he said something to the tiger . I could n't hear his words , only the quality of his sounds , but whatever it was he said , he got the tiger 's attention . The tiger looked at him and before anyone knew what had happened the tamer was on the ground in a pool of blood . The big iron gate swung open by itself and the big tiger stepped out of the cage . People screamed and ran , some down to the aisles and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the top of the bleachers , packing in together with nowhere to go . I do n't know which way Errol ran , but I stayed put , right there in the front row . No one was near me . I watched the tiger rip open the arm of a circus roadie who was trying to toss a net over him . Another roadie was reluctantly trying to draw a bead on the cat with a rifle . The screaming and shouting fused into a kind of meaningless roar . Then the cat was standing in front of me . I heard my mother 's voice pierce the deadened hush . The tiger turned his enormous head and took my body into his mouth , closed his jaws about my waist . But he did n't bite down , though I could feel the coolness of several of his teeth against the skin of my back and sides . <p> 1 September <p> The tiger carried me in his mouth down the aisle toward the exit . I looked up and saw my mother in the crowd on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't hear any sound coming out of her . I could hear only the raspy breathing of the big cat . I saw my father trying to push and weave through the pulsing tangle of bodies . People scurried for cover on tops of trucks and cars and behind refuse barrels and small boulders as we passed . I could feel the pad of each footfall against the stiff ground . Errol was standing in the bed of a pickup with his father and I could see that he wanted to run to my rescue , but was being held back . Then , in his face , I could see that Errol did not want to save my life , but that he wanted to sever my connection to the cat . He was not concerned about my welfare . He was jealous . I stared at his eyes as the tiger carried me past him . I smiled . <p> But where was the animal taking me ? I began to grow fearful . I found it remarkable that this was my first pang of concern for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat had captured me , that it was not the other way around . The tiger carried me off into the night , toward the big wash . <p> 1 September <p> As I was being carried between the teeth , I tried to remember everything I knew about tigers . I did n't know much . I knew that tigers had poor vision . I knew that they had a weak sense of smell . I knew that they hunted by sound . I knew that they were aggressive hunters . I knew they were sometimes man-eaters . The cat put me down near some large rocks and walked away a few steps , then dropped to the ground , seemingly exhausted . I was too afraid to stand or even sit up . I moved my foot barely an inch , my toes moving a pebble on the ground not quite enough to push it from its spot in the sand , and the tiger let out a warning rasp of breath , a sound that was not quite a roar , but substantially more than a purr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slow my breathing and calm my heart . I wondered how long it would be before my father came for me . I wondered if some man from the circus was at that moment drawing a bead on the cat with a scoped rifle loaded with a dart . I kept seeing Errol 's face . <p> 1 September <p> The tiger and I slept and morning came . I had been cold all night , but for some reason I was able to sleep through until light . The tiger got up and paced a circle around me . Then I heard the voice of the circus master of ceremonies . He was calling my name and I could tell he was drawing nearer . He got closer and closer and the tiger heard him , too . I called out to him and told him to stay away . But he came , anyway . The tiger roared , his big noise echoing off the rocks , but he came , anyway . The big cat hissed at him when he was in sight , but the master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from me , reaching out to me , calling me by my full name , telling me he was going to take me to my parents . Then the tiger ran at him . The tiger bit into his stomach and he screamed out some name I did n't know . I cried out into the morning air . The tiger clawed at his face , erased it . The tiger glanced at me then lapped at the man 's life , licked up the red juice of his existence . <p> 1 September <p> The tiger and I slept again until the sun was straight overhead and the heat was considerable . The tiger got up and paced circles around me once more . Then I heard the voice of Errol . He was calling my name and I could tell he was drawing nearer . He got closer and closer and the tiger heard him , too . I called out to him and told him to stay away . But he came , anyway .

The tiger glanced at me then lapped at Errol 's life , licked up the red juice of his existence . <p> 1 September <p> It was late summer , just days before school would start . That perfect time . The heat was just so . <p> The tiger and I slept again until the sun was starting down in the west . I could feel the air beginning to cool just a little . The tiger got up and paced circles around me once more . I had grown accustomed to it . Then I heard the voice of my mother . She was calling my name and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer and closer and the tiger heard her , too . I called out to her and told her to stay away .

It was late summer , just days before school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of Errol and the master of ceremonies . <p> The tiger and I had been sleeping again , our bodies touching . The air was stiffly cold and there was a persistent wind . The tiger got up , but did not pace this time , but sat beside me , sniffing the breeze . Then I heard the voice of my father . He was calling my name and I could tell he was drawing nearer . He got closer and closer and the tiger heard him , too . I called out to him and told him to stay away , told him what had happened to Mother . But he came , anyway , saying that I was his son and that he would protect me .

It was late summer , just days before school would start and it was snowing in the desert . I walked a circle around the sleeping beast , kicking through the bones and flesh of my life , the parts of my friend and my mother and my father and of someone I did not know , but who had come to try to save me . I stepped on my mother 's delicate fingers . The blood of my father stuck to the sole of my shoe and made a kissing sound . <p>
