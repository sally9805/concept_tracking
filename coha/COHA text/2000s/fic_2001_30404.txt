Book One : SPIRIT GATE " Inside us are fifteen Spirit Gates . They are meant to be open . If even one is not , a blockage occurs ; a sickness of spirit that , left untreated , can and will rot the soul from within . " Utmost Source , The Five Sacred Books of Miina Owl Sixteen yearsa lifetimelater , Bartta , now a small , dark , hunchedfigure not unlike a lorg , found herself on the same path . The skywas cloudless , of a blue so achingly rich it bore the appearance offresh lacquer . The sun was in its waning hours , magnified by the atmosphere , so that its curious purple spot seemed like the pupil of an eye.Miina 's Eye , the Ramahan believed , that saw and recorded everything . Borne upon the air was the scent of the kuello-firs , and when Bartta'ssandals crunched the brown needles she felt again that tiny shiver ofrecognition of things apart . In an instant the afternoon she had killedthe lorg came rushing back to her . She paused , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden hue under which , years ago , she hadfound the lorg . Bartta wore the long , persimmon-colored robes of raw silk reserved for the konara , senior priestesses of the Dea Cretan , the Ramahan HighCouncil . In the old days , before the coming of the V'ornn , the Ramahanwere ruled by one woman : Mother . That was her title , which she inheritedas a child , when her name was taken from her forever . At thattime , the Ramahan had been made up of equal numbers of womenandmenif such a thing could be imagined ! The men had been purgedafter their innate greed led to the loss of The Pearl , the sorcerous Rappahad been destroyed , and the Dea Cretan was formed to ensure that theviolence that had engulfed the Order would never again occur , that thesorcery that had been inextricably bound into Ramahan society wascarefully weeded out , strand by strand . As Bartta moved along the path she was immersed in a halo ofmyrrh , oils of clove , and clary-sage , the incense she burned when sheprayed . These spices gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her forefinger against her thin , unpainted lips.Where was that rock ? She was close to it , she knew that much . The passage of time and the vagaries of her memory caused her towalk past it twice . Each time , however , her Ramahan training compelledher to turn around , and at last she recognized the rock , whosegolden color flashed only here and there beneath a dull layer of shaledust and kuello-fir needles . Lifting the hem of her robes , she half sliddown the slope into the gully , picked her way carefully across the looseshale and the odd tufts of yellow wrygrass that had sprung up . Overthe years , a geological eruption had warped and scarred the depression.The rock now lay like a kind of bridge across what appeared to be afissure in the gully bed . She bent to touch the cool , rough , golden skin of that rock , stirringeven after all this time with images of the lorg . She cursed heartily.That lorg had certainly been an evil omen . Three days after its deathGiyan had been captured in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the V'ornn . That was sixteen years ago , and never a word from hersince . She had heard stories , many times , about the regent 's Kundalanmistress . Giyan was sharing her bed with a V'ornn . How could she ? Itwas unimaginable ! Thinking of the dreaded V'ornn , Bartta shuddered.That is when she heard the soundtiny , indistinct , echoey . She turnedback , looked around the perimeter of the gully . Nothing stirred savethe shivering tops of the graceful kuello-firs . The sound came again , trickling down her spine like a rivulet of icewater . On her knees , she peered into the fissure . Darkness greeted herbeyond the sliver of opening between rock and shale bed . " Hello ? " she called in a voice as quavery as if it were underwater . " Hello ? " A sound , neither human nor animal but somewhere in between , came to her . It made her jerk erect , her scalp prickling eerily . Shebacked up , stumbling a little , righted herself , then turned to flee acrossthe gully . Failing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell , rippingthe robe and skinning a knee . She gave a little cry , regained her footing , and ran on . As she reached the slope at the edge of the gully , she pausedto catch her breath , squinting upward into the luminous ultramarinesky . Her pulse hammered , and her mouth was dry . The soft , eerie moaning of the wind made the boulders and gulliesseem alive even as it concealed that other hideous sound . She turnedher gaze toward the stands of kuello-firs and breathed deeply to ridherself of the last splinter of fear . She started as the great horned owlemerged from shadowed , needled branches , swooped low on enormous , soundless wings . She called Miina 's name , for the owl was the sacredmessenger of the Goddess . It seemed to be heading straight for her . Shepressed herself against the slope . Too late to run . She was murmuringa prayer when it passed close enough for her to feel the backwash ofits mighty grey-blue wings . Then it swooped even lower , and shewhirled to follow its flight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then again , and a third time , before lifting on powerful pinions , andwheeling away into the dark kuello-fir forest . A peculiar terror gripped her . The owl was an omen , of course . Anextraordinary omen , because an owl in daylight signified imminentdeath . Her sense of dread escalated , but she knew that she could notignore an omen from Miina . But that could not be ; Miina had passedbeyond the rim , or so she had convinced herself . Then what was Miina'smessenger doing here ? She had to find out . Reluctantly , she retraced her steps . She fell to her knees beside thestone , grimacing with pain . The sun sat atop the collar of the forest ; the shadows in the gully were long , blue , dense . Bartta grunted . The rock moved with the reluctance of an invalid , its protest in the form of a miniavalanche of shale . The chilling soundcame again , and on her belly she stuck her head into the fissure . In the last of the light she could just make out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animaland small , certainly not an adult . Once again , she almost turned away . She had no desire to descendinto that dangerous darkness . But her training held her . Miina had spoken ; now she must act . How long had it been since Miina had giventhe Ramahan a sign ? Bartta did not know . A long time , anyway . A verylong time . " Hold on ! " she called , clambering down . " I 'm coming for you ! " Nearly choking in a cloud of dust , she descended , cursing mightily , using her thick , work-hardened hands to grasp small outcroppings tokeep her from pitching headlong into the fissure . She needed to beespecially careful because the friable shale was all too apt to shear offor crumble beneath her weight . The preponderance of sedimentaryrock in this area , she knew , was due to the Chuun River , which flowedfrom here all the way down to Axis Tyr , the Kundalan city the V'ornnhad chosen as their capital . Bartta had heard many stories of Axis Tyras it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue-and-rosestone sitting astride the Chuun River . Now , from all she couldglean , the only Kundalan inside the city were miserable prisoners orslaves . Like Giyan . Bartta 's hard heart was wrung out with the terrible sacrifices she hadmade . It had become a poor shrunken organ no more useful than astone . Yet she could still hate . Her blood ran cold when she thoughtof the V'ornn . Such monsters ! So nasty to look at ; hairless as a rottenclemett and twice as smelly . You could never be certain what the hairlessbeasts were thinking , though members of the Kundalan resistancehad come to know how they would react in certain situations . But theresistance was largely impotent . Of what use was their deaths ? Onehundred and one years after the occupation and nothing had changed.There was no help for it . One had to learn how to live with the yokearound one 's neck . Miina be praised that Giyan had been taken by the V'ornn and nother . Bartta knew that she would surely have hung herself rather thanbe made to serve them or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her twin had shown a perverse curiosity about the V'ornn . Nowshe had her wish . Bartta had begun to sweat . It was unnaturally hot inside the fissure , and she made her stumbling way around the perimeter to avoid theworst of the heat , which seemed to be rising in sickening waves fromthe jagged rock floor . A copse of pink calcite stalagmites rose from theperiphery of the fissure floor like grasping fingers . The heated air shimmeredand burned her lungs so that she hastened to the spot wherethe figure lay . A girl of perhaps fifteen years , Bartta saw , who was shakingas if with the ague . A cloyingly sweet-smelling sweat rimed herforehead , matted her long , tangled , blond hair . Her beautiful featureswere clouded , darkened , ravaged . When Bartta scooped her up in herarms , the girl felt as if she were on fire . The girl cried out as Bartta carried her back to the opening she hadmade by moving the rock above . " Stop your sniveling , " she snapped . " I will have you out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But judging by the girl 's flushed and dryskin , Bartta did not believe that . The Ramahan were great healers aswell as mystics . Bartta could well read the signs of duur fever , and sheliked not the advanced stage the virus was in . This fever , which camein five-year cycles , had ravaged the Kundalan for a century now . TheRamahan believed that the V'ornn had brought the virus to Kundala ; the resistance was certain that the Gyrgon , the mysterious V'ornn casteof technomages , had manufactured it as another weapon in their overwhelmingarsenal to bring the Kundalan race to its knees . In any case , the Ramahan had had only limited success in saving the victims of duurfever . If it was caught within forty-eight hours of the onset of symptoms , a poultice of a mixture of the rendered seeds of black loosestrifeand the thistle heart of coltsfoot digitalis had proved effective . Otherwise , once the virus reached the lungs it replicated so rapidly thatwithin days the victim drowned as if lost at sea . With the girl in her arms , Bartta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It looked a long way off , farther by far than the floorof the fissure had looked before she had scrambled down here . The girlwas dying , no doubt about it . Of what possible use was she then ? Perhaps , if she , Bartta , was able to get her out of here and back to thevillage she could prolong her life a week , two at the outside . But towhat purpose ? Already the girl 's face was distorted by pain , and hersuffering would only grow . Better to leave her here ; a quick deathwould be merciful , a blessing even . But as Bartta was setting her down , a small earth tremor sent shalescaling down on them . Bartta braced herself against the trembling sideof the fissure as the girl cried out . Her eyes focused and she moanedpitifully , clinging to Bartta . Waiting for the tremor to abate , Bartta hadcause to recall Miina 's sacred owl . Now that the Goddess had at lastspoken , She had chosen Bartta ! The owl had passed three times overthis fissure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girlhere to expire . But what then the meaning of Miina 's messages ? Perhapsthe Goddess meant for this girl to become her property . But , again , why ? Was she in some way special ? Bartta peered down at the face so ethereally beautiful , so ashen shecould plainly see the play of blue veins beneath skin unnaturally tautand shiny with fever . Brushing lank hair back from the girl 's forehead , she said : " What is your name ? " " Riane . " Her heart was beating as fast as an ice-hare 's . " Hmm . I do not recognize that name . Where are you from ? " The girl 's face wrinkled up . " I do not ... I ca n't remember . Except ... " " Except what , my dear ? " " I remember skelling . " " Skelling ? " Bartta frowned . " I do not believe I know that word . Whatdoes it mean ? " " Skelling . You know , climbing up and down sheer rock faces . " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know does that . " " I do , " Riane said boldly . " I mean , I did . I distinctly remember comingdown Four Whites . " " But that is impossible , " Bartta said . Four Whites was the name of asheer mountain cliff that rose a kilometer above the abbey . It was toosteep , rugged , and ice-strewn even for the surefooted mountain goats . " Not really . I 've done it many times . " Bartta 's frown deepened . " All right , let 's say you did this skellingthing . What happened next ? " " A handhold I had been using sheared , dear , but how did you wind up here , beneath the goldrock ? " " I ... do n't know . " Bartta sighed . " What do you remember ? What about your mother ? Your father ? " Riane shook her head . " Think , girl . Think ! " Riane shied away from her , curling up into a ball . With an effort , Bartta softened her voice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important . " " Everything else is a blank . " Amnesia , Bartta thought . She must be injured as well as sick . As if to underscore this , the girl whimpered , " I do n't feel good . " " You are going to be all right , " Bartta said automatically , though shedoubted that very much . " Do n't leave me , " the girl blurted suddenly . Bartta felt as if she had a millstone around her neck . Forcing herself to smile , she said , " We will leave together . Very soon you will see the " The girl 's startling blue eyes bobbled this way and that as anothertremor possessed the fissure . With a hiss and clatter , more shale shookloose , scattering itself across the rock floor . " Will we die here ? " the girlasked . She was obviously unaware of her condition . " We will not die here . " Bartta arranged her features in what shehoped was a reassuring smile . " I am Bartta of Stone " Riane screamed as the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No sense in crying , " Bartta said sternly over Riane 's moaning . " We will be out of here soon enough . " Over the girl 's head shecould see layers of shale sluicing toward the center of the fissure floor , where they vanished into an opening the tremors had pried open in thebedrock . I must get out of here , Bartta thought , or I will die . Again , sheconsidered leaving the girl behind , but the image of Miina 's owl remained in her mind 's eye , bending her to its imperative . She stood and , bracing herself against the side of the fissure , hoistedRiane until she was draped over her left shoulder . " All right , " she said . " Hold on tight now . " Thus burdened , she began to climb . It was slow going . She was savvyenough to know that a goodly number of the hand- and toeholds shehad used on her way down had been compromised by the quakes . Theones she found she tested twice before moving cautiously upward . Allthe while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her back , spreadingan ache through her shoulders and hips that quite soon bloomed intooutright pain . Still , she continued her climb , willing herself not tohurry , to test each makeshift rung lest it crumble beneath her , sendingher and the girl back to the fissure floor . But always in the back of hermind lurked the spectre of another tremor , which would surely dislodgeher . She felt more vulnerable than she had since entering the Ramahansinecure of Floating White but , most curiously , she also felt a kind ofexhilaration as she connected with her body again , using it as she hadwhen she was a little girl . It felt fine to have dirt beneath her nailsagain , to feel the flex and draw of muscle and sinew as they worked.She was aware of Riane whimpering behind her , and she prayed thatin her weakened state she would be able to hold on . Two-thirds of the way up , Bartta ran out of handholds . Three separatepossibilities crumbled under her grip , the third breaking apartonly as she put all their combined weight on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that caused a painful percussion up her spine.Riane passed out . Just as well , Bartta thought . The girl is terrified enoughfor the both of us . Despite instinct urging her nerve endings to move , Bartta took timeto breathe deeply . For the moment , the earth had grown still , but cockingan ear she heard not a single birdsong , and this she interpreted aswarning that there was more seismic activity to come . Living all herlife in the embrace of the Djenn Marre , she was no stranger to quakes.They were lightest in the lower foothills , increasing in intensity thefarther one penetrated the high crags . Once , when she was on her wayto deliver the monthly ration of supplies to the Ice Caves , she had beenunlucky enough to be caught in a quake that had sheared off a sectionof cliff face not seven meters from where she had crouched in terror.The Ice Caves were infrequently visited and only by Ramahan acolytes.They were carved out of the granite Djenn Marre like the eyrie of afantastic mythic raptor five kilometers from the abbey and a kilometerabove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theChuun . How the Tchakira lived up there was anyone 's guess . But whatmore did they deserve , these dregs and outcastscriminals , misfits , madmen who had been expunged from society ? Still , they were Kundalan.The Ramahan felt it the sacred duty of Miina to ensure thatthese poor wretches would not perish in the wind- and ice-swept peaksof the Djenn Marre . Not that any civilized Kundalan had ever seen aTchakira . But they existed , all right , for when the Ramahan acolytearrived at the Ice Caves , as Bartta had , the previous month 's rationswere gone . She , like all the acolytes before her , had paused only longenough to lay down the small , dense packages of food and herb concentrates , consume a gulp or two of cloudy rakkis , and head back downthe ice-encrusted , nearly vertical trail . Now another nearly vertical trail loomed above her . Despite her elevation , the evening sky seemed farther away than ever , a mockingshell , blackened like a burnt offering . A star emerged from the envelopingdarkness , crackling blue-white fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured their reflected light into the fissure . Bartta felt itfirst in the soles of her feet , and she braced herself , praying furiouslyfor Miina to extend Her protective hand . A clap like thunder broke thelow rumbling , echoed painfully in her ears . As the earth lurched , sheslipped , desperately hanging on . The fissure all around her seemed tobe breaking apart , and she was certain that she was about to breatheher last . Stillness so absolute it was unnerving enveloped everything . Lookingup , she saw that the wall itself had split so that the upper tier nowstepped back in a kind of ragged staircase . Instinct drove her upward.In an instant , she had reached the natural steps and , scrambling asquickly as she was able under the circumstances , made her way out ofthe fissure . Gaining the floor of the gully , she did not pause even to catch herbreath , but half ran with the insensate girl still over her shoulder . Notuntil she found herself safely on the path that wound through thekuello-firs down to Stone Border did she even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see she could not say , but in the wanmoonslight spilling down like milk from a she-goat 's udders she sawnothing out of the ordinary . With a grunt , she shifted her burden to aless painful position , then hurried down the path toward home .
