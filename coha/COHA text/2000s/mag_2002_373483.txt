Jaguars are fast , sleek and loaded with features  --  or at least , Apple 's new Jaguar ( $129 ) is . It 's the latest upgrade to the Mac OS  --  10.2 , if you 're keeping count . Previous versions of OS X were criticized for being slower than their predecessor , OS 9 , but Jaguar zooms on by . Graphics and text look smoother than ever and are put to good use in some neat new programs . There 's iChat ( compatible with AOL Instant Messenger ) , in which conversations take place in little speech balloons . Sherlock 3 will find movies , flight times and Yellow Pages listings in a click or two without the hassle of actually getting on the Internet . And there 's a great new spam filter in the e-mail program . If you 're a Mac user who 's been holding out on OS X , it could be time to play around with a furry feline .  --  By Chris Taylor              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
