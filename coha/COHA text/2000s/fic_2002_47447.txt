WAYNE PUNCHED THE HEAVY BAG for a while and worked up a big , hard sweat , and then the gunny put the gloves on him and he got into the ring , a small one they had set up in one corner of the weight room . He sparred four rounds with a heavyweight , a tall , skinny Texan named Dobbs who was used to working out with him . Since he had won seven straight even the marines were pulling for him now , and some of them had sparred with him , one in particular , a middleweight staff sergeant from El Paso named Eusubio Dejesus who owned a wicked left hook and had lost his left little toe to an Iraqi mine . Wayne liked him . Once in a while he 'd see him in the galley and eat with him if Henderson was working . <p> He felt strong , and he gave Dobbs more than he wanted , though he got stung a few times . In between rounds he hung his gloves over the top rope and looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tried not to think about her . Anjalee . <p> But that was getting to be just about impossible . She was even invading his dreams now , always in living color , and in them he nuzzled her ruby nipples on some springtime patch of soft green grass where they had spread a quilt and then pushed himself up inside her to unspeakably good feelings and was immediately coming in his underwear in the real world , between the two worlds somehow , another wet dream barely wakened to , still going on , or just ending , and he recognized it for what it was with a groan , knowing he 'd wake up with his belly slick and cold from being in it all night , then rolling over under his blanket , trying to get back to that place he had just dreamed , always the feeling of motion , of being taken forward , the slight rocking in the night that lulled him back to sleep . <p> They got through , and the gunny took the gloves off , and they pulled the headgear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dobbs for sparring with him and told the gunny he 'd see him later , but inside he was in turmoil . They were probably hundreds of miles out to sea by now . And that would turn into thousands . Anything could happen . They could be sent anywhere in the world immediately if the wrong thing happened . They might have to fight somebody . That 's what they were on this fucking thing for . <p> He took a shower and dried and got back into his clothes and combed his hair . He 'd never see her again . That was probably the reality . That was what he had to deal with . Unless he could get off the ship some way soon . And get back to where he 'd met her . He could find the bar again ; that was no problem . There were people there who would know her . Like the guy behind the bar who fixed her drinks , and had seemed to kind of be in charge of things , more than just a bartender . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lejeune . Fuck cruising the Sea of Arabia . He had to get back to Memphis . <p> He could ask the guy who fixed her drinks for her address , or her phone number . He 'd go in the joint and sit and wait for her . He 'd walk the streets all around there and see if she passed by . He could do whatever it took to see her again , and to sit down and talk to her , and tell her he was in love with her , that he could give her a better life than the one she had now for sure . <p> The only thing wrong with that plan was the U.S. Navy , which owned his ass for twenty-one more months . About the only way to get loose was to get discharged , or take leave . If you did something illegal , were caught , they 'd punish you , and if it was bad enough they 'd kick you out . That was a dishonorable discharge . People said that would follow you around the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stopped combing his hair and leaned on the sink , looking at the shiny chrome ring around the drain . <p> There was a medical discharge . If you got hurt bad enough or were sick enough , they could let you go that way . There were those headaches he 'd been having . But he hoped there was n't anything wrong with him . If you went AWOL they 'd probably put you in the brig for a while . They might not kick you out for that , but it would be a dishonorable discharge if they did . And sometime he 'd have to face his daddy , who had served nine years in the navy and would have served many more except that his own father died suddenly and he had to come back and take care of the family farm . Wayne would have to look him right in the eye , try to say Hey , Paw . <p> Shit . That would n't be any fun . And anyway he had already imagined taking Anjalee back there , to their house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porch with all the flowers and plants , had imagined opening it , stepping in , holding her by the hand , and his good mother in her apron would turn from the stove , and she would run to hug him , and laugh , and kiss him , and then , smiling , she would look past his shoulder at the girl he would be already turning to , and he would say : " Mother , I 've got somebody I want you to meet . " <p> He got his gym bag and stuffed his shoes in and zipped it shut and then went back up to his dim cubicle . There was only Henderson in there , and he was asleep . He 'd been working a lot lately . Wayne did n't wake him , but lay down instead and was unable to sleep for a long time because of thinking about Anjalee , but he finally did , and then sometime during the night a tremendous shock went through the ship that woke him , and there was an awful , immense groaning noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could hear an alarm going off , BaBONG , BaBONG , BaBONG . <p> Henderson turned on his light and rolled over . <p> " What the shit , bro ? " Wayne said . <p> " We done hit somethin ' . " <p> " Hit something ? What the hell could we hit out here ? " <p> " I do n't know , " Henderson said . He sat up suddenly . He 'd been sleeping in his clothes . He rubbed at some sleep in the corner of one eye . <p> Something very wrong had happened . A collision of some kind . And everybody knew that collisions were not allowed in the U.S. Navy . Wayne sat up and started dressing . Henderson grabbed his flip-flops and stuck them on his feet . Then they hurried out to the passageway together . <p> They had stopped engines , and it was kind of hard to believe until some screwup in communications happened and the NBC and ABC helicopters started arriving and landing on the flight deck , along with some Coast Guard people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wayne saw it with Henderson in the TV room , which was almost deserted , since a lot of the crew who were off duty were either sleeping or up on deck talking about it and trying to see what was going on and grabassing and maybe hoping to get interviewed , and Admiral Zumo was on his way out to have a personal peek . <p> Something else must have gone wrong . Somebody must have said something they should n't have , or maybe when they said it somebody else misunderstood , and maybe that was how an NBC cameraman wound up leaning over the edge of the flight deck unseen behind a crowd of enlisted men who just happened to be standing there , with a couple of third-class petty officers holding on to his belt while he took unauthorized video of the whale that had been struck by the propeller but not killed . Wallowing out there in the rolling waves , blood staining the water , and Wayne as he watched knew that America would see the blood and the whale suffering and that a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Henderson to figure out what was going on at first . There were all kinds of rumors floating around the ship . Some said the prop was broken , and that they were stranded . Some said the whale had a baby , and that the baby was crying and swimming around its dying mother . Nothing like that had appeared on the TV screen yet , but being in the military , they knew how the government could suppress information at almost any time and for almost any reason , say , something that might be sensitive , like secretly invading another country , and if there was indeed a baby whale swimming around and crying because its mother had been struck by an aircraft carrier , they 'd damn well want to suppress it until they could decide what to do . Shit . There was no telling how long it took to decide what to do about them dead little green men they found crashed in Roswell back in ' 47 , is what Henderson said . <p> It was rumored that Peter Jennings was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship . It was a fact that Cuba Gooding Jr . had been on the ship , for the premiere of Pearl Harbor . It was rumored that the captain had been on the land line with the president , that the president was concerned but waiting for developments while catching Billy Joe Shaver at the Continental Club in Austin , that something had gone wrong and some film had been released that should n't have been . <p> Then most everybody was confined belowdecks . They could go to the galley and eat , they could work , they could sleep , but they could not go up . Then some sailors were called up . But they stayed up and did n't come back down . There was nobody to ask anything . One person 's guess was as good as another 's . Things got pretty boring pretty quickly . Wayne and Henderson played cards , watched a movie , ate sandwiches , played some dominoes , heard more rumors . <p> At 2230 , when they were in the TV room , the captain finally gave them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was true that the ship had hit a blue whale normally not seen in these waters , a whale that may have been sick and whose sonar might have been impaired . Yes , the propeller had severely injured it . Yes , there was a whale calf involved , about a twenty-footer . The ship was stopped for an investigation , which was SOP , and since they were only three days out they would probably be going back to port , but right now they were about to be involved , along with some civilians , in a rescue effort for the orphaned calf . That was all for now . The intercom went off , but then there was a long , fuzzy buzz with enough feedback that they thought maybe Neil Young was onboard with his electric guitar and about to come over the loudspeakers with " Mother Earth . " <p> " Sheeeit , Wayne , " Henderson said , turning back to the television and reaching into a big bag for more Fritos . " Rescue effort my ass . We ai n't never gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this whale shit . " <p> The rescue effort failed . A bunch of Seals in coldwater scuba gear and loaded with shark repellent went out a compartment in black rubber boats with twin Johnson engines , and they tried to help the mother whale , but she was too grievously injured to be saved . That probably did n't mean it would be a quick death . The whale watch started at 1430 . <p> At about 1500 , a sunny afternoon but cold , Wayne and Henderson stood on deck , watching them surround the whale mother below in the mostly deserted Atlantic . Some Coast Guard cutters lay far off , white dots . Even from high up , Wayne could see the three terrible diagonal cuts across her side , and the bulge of her gray intestines spilling into the water with some blood . A Greenpeace boat out of Norfolk had pulled next to them , and the water between the enormous ship and the environmentalists ' vessel was stained red . Everybody was looking for sharks , and some had guns they 'd checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " That 's a lowdown dirty shame , " Henderson said . " That thing swimmin ' around free as a bird . Nursin ' that baby like a cow . " <p> " They ai n't gon na catch that calf , neither , " Wayne said . No shit . The Greenpeace guys had brought nets to make a temporary containment pen and had made an effort to herd it into one of them with small motorboats , but the calf , which weighed at least a ton , had turned over one of the boats and almost drowned three of the six volunteers who were on it by hitting them in its fear and panic with its tail a couple of times . One of the Greenpeacers had a concussion and a few subdural hematomas and a broken nose and three broken fingers and had to be airlifted out by Coast Guard choppers . They had given up after that , since they were n't prepared to try and shoot the calf with a tranquilizer gun and risk having it drown , and now they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother die . The calf was shy and hung back . <p> All the news people had been ordered to leave ; the Pentagon was pissed . Now there was nobody but the Greenpeace dudes and the soldiers of the sea to watch . So many people wanted to get up on deck and see what was going on that they had to schedule it in shifts . The captain came over the intercom once and said he did n't think it was much of a thing to watch , kind of like a flood , but those that wanted to could go up in shifts if they were off duty . <p> " Shit , " Henderson said , looking at Wayne . " Cap'n all worried about his job now he done had a collision . Ai n't even his fault . A career-endin ' fuck-up . All he usually worried about is gettin ' him a cold Schlitz after supper and kick back to watch Bonanza . " <p> " How you know he drinks Schlitz ? " Wayne said . <p> " Poo-Head . Works in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wind was blowing in Wayne 's face , and his white cap was on his head . The cuffs of his bellbottoms were wet . The whale lay on her side , trying to maintain a position where she could still blow her exhaled air out of the water . She rose and fell slightly with the motion of the ocean . The Seals and the Greenpeace guys had surrounded her with their flotilla of boats and nets . Some of them were touching her . Still others at her head were saying things to her . She was almost too weak to move now , and the Seals were not scared of anything anyway . Somebody had called from SEC-NAV in D.C. and talked to one of the radiomen and said he thought the whale was a hell of a lot longer than the one hanging on a wall at the Smithsonian , and that that son of a bitch was 150 feet long . Nobody knew when they were going back . That decision had n't been made . It was up to somebody bigger than the captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he felt bad for the whale since she was the one who had to cause it , had to lose her life so he could go back to Anjalee . He decided he would stay on the deck as long as he could . <p> He and Henderson stayed until dark . Wayne worked for a while in the armory and let a couple of marines check out their M-14s so they could clean them for an inspection , and they bought Wayne a Coke from the machine , and one of them said that his great-grandfather 's brother had once fought John L. Sullivan but had been knocked out in the first ten seconds of the second round . <p> Wayne read woodworking magazines and cut his fingernails . He wondered what Anjalee was doing right now . He wondered if she 'd seen the stuff on TV about the whale , the stuff that had gone out before they 'd confiscated all the camera equipment and run everybody off . She might even be sitting in that same bar . <p> Time always dragged in here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racks and racks of them , all oiled , ready to go into instant service . Rocket launchers . Grenade launchers . Tank killers . The Seals had big arms and legs and 7.62 mm M60 machine guns with enormous loads of ammunition and bipods . Wayne knew a few of them . He 'd seen one eat two and a half rib-eyes one night . <p> After a few hours his relief came in , and he went for a roast-beef sandwich with hot mustard but did n't see Henderson or Sergeant DeJesus in the galley . He talked to some boys he knew who were flight-deck hands . One of them said it looked like the whale would die pretty soon , and another said he thought it might take days . <p> After he finished eating he still was n't sleepy , so he went to see if he could get back on deck , and he could . The lights were up on the bridge as if for flight operations . The ship rocked slightly in the low swells . He walked to the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chill night air , and he was surprised to see that the Seals and some Greenpeace guys were still in the water dumping shark repellent and using lamps they had rigged on their boats as well as some spotlights from the carrier . It was still about the same story . Lurking nearby was the calf . Wayne could see it , a vague shape under the water waiting outside the circle of men and boats that were gathered around its mother . <p> The whale kept spouting , and now it had started a weird crying that Wayne could hear high up on the deck . A thin keening , and dark all around , except for the pools of light down there on the water , and the swells rocking the whalesavers ' boat , and even after Wayne stood there another hour she was n't dead . He was almost frozen by then . The group on deck got smaller and smaller . People had to get sleep so that they could work . Or they had to eat or write letters home before they went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anjalee for a long time . He heard Henderson come in just before he fell asleep thinking of the house he 'd want for her . He did n't care if she was a whore . She was a beautiful whore . She was his whore . What if she was a whore ? Just let somebody say something to him about it . <p> The alarm went off at 0600 , and Wayne hit it with his hand and then lay there . It was dark except for a tiny light over LeBonte 's empty bed . Fucker knew to cut his light off before he left . Wayne lay on his back , warm under his wool blanket . He could n't hear anything but Henderson doing a slight droning number . <p> He dressed quietly and put on his peacoat and grabbed a banana and a cup of coffee from the galley and looked at the eggs they were frying and thought maybe he could have some later , and went back up on deck . It was very cold . Only a few sailors were out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a long , slow turn under a hollow orange light against the horizon with smeared gray clouds over it . The rocking swells were wide , and there was nothing on the horizon but more of them . He looked down . The whale was gone . All the navy divers , were out of the water . The Greenpeace boat was only a memory now . <p> " They said she drowned , " a guy next to Wayne said . <p> He thought about that . To be born in water and die in it . <p> " What about the calf ? " <p> " I do n't know , man . I guess it had to go on . I guess it figured hanging around us was n't too good an idea after we killed its mama . " <p> The sailor had his hands in his jacket pocket , and he motioned toward the water with his elbow . <p> " One of the Seals said he thought it was asking us for help . " <p> " I heard it , " Wayne said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hunger back any longer , and he suddenly wanted hot sausage and three over easy and knew he could have them . Toast and jelly . Memphis . When he found her this time he was n't going to let her go . <p> He kept standing there . He hated to think about the calf in the wide open , swimming along by itself . How would it find others like it ? Was it calling to them , even now ? He knew they sang to each other , from Iceland to Jamaica . Were the songs bouncing off deep underwater cliffs ? How did anybody know how far those songs could go ? <p> He just hoped it would live . He hoped for that as hard as he 'd ever hoped for anything in his life . Not counting Anjalee . Wayne 's new orders came in. on a noisy orange-and-white Coast Guard chopper about 1620 and landed on the flight deck . Guys in coveralls and orange helmets passed out the mail and some cakes and cookies from home , and then it seemed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand-and-arm signals . The captain called Wayne into his tiny stateroom , where he was working at his tiny desk . Wayne stood at attention , wondering what the hell he 'd done . " Stubbock ? " <p> " Yes sir . " <p> I " At ease , sailor . Look , Bosnick 's fat ass did n't make the weight , so SEC-NAV wants you over at Camp Lejeune ASAP for a match with this jarhead Johnson from Third MAW . Before Christmas . I know it 's a rush job , but Admiral Hoozey called this in . Happens to be a big fan of yours . And I got a lot of shit to do . I may be getting shitcanned right out of this man 's navy for hitting a whale . Got it ? " <p> " Sir ? The admiral ? Is a fan of mine ? " Wayne said . <p> " Scoop is the admiral saw you at Philadelphia and won fifteen hundred on you off the Army brass . When you knocked out Stevenson . I picked up three hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The captain had his pen in hand , and it was poised over the papers . How could he tell him he needed to go back to Memphis , not North Carolina ? How could he tell him about Anjalee ? He tried to stall . <p> " Sir , uh . That 's not long to train for a fight . " <p> The captain visibly recoiled and then recovered . " Let me tell you something , sailor . Sometimes the United States Navy has to fight with no warning at all . Look at Pearl Harbor , sneaky bastards . Sunday morning . You can stay on this tin can if you want to . I 'm just waiting for retirement anyway . I 'm short . I 'm so short I can sit on a dime and swing my legs . " <p> Wayne did n't know what to say . <p> " I 'm so short I can walk under a door . " <p> " Sir . Uh . I need to get back to Memphis sometime . Would it be possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The captain looked puzzled . " Why you want to go to Memphis ? <p> You 're from Ohio , are n't you ? " <p> He did n't know what to say . He said it . <p> " I left something there , sir . " <p> " Well . . . " The captain looked back up . " What 'd you leave ? A girl ? " <p> " Yes sir , " Wayne said reluctantly . And then he stood straight and strengthened his voice . " Yessir . A girl . " <p> " All right , well ... in that case ... hmmm . " The captain hummed a few lines of " I Left My Heart in San Francisco " while tapping his fingers and then picked up a piece of paper , scribbled something on it , stamped it , and handed it to Wayne . <p> " Look here . I got a woman in Tampa with tits that 'll make you weep when you have to leave port . Every night I spend on this greasy skillet is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go whip this marine for the power and the glory of the United States Navy , and I 'll give you a ten-day furlough . Guaranteed . There 's a colonel at Parris Island I 'd like to win some of my money back off of anyway . We were in San Diego together . Asshole used to cheat me at pinochle . " <p> " Are you serious , sir ? Ten days ? " <p> " I 'm serious as a heart attack , son . " <p> " Yessir . " <p> " Go pack your stuff , then . That chopper 's burning fuel waiting for you , and it 's getting dark . " <p> He had to tell Henderson good-bye quickly . Everything he owned ended up in one duffel bag . They stood in the passageway together , and Wayne talked fast but did n't have time to explain it all . <p> " Well , shit , " Henderson said , shuffling his feet . " You just takin ' off , just like that ? I thought we 's gon na watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Wayne said , and then he stopped . " I meant to tell you something . I met a girl in Memphis . And I ... we ... I 'm going back down there . But I 've got to fight this marine . I got to beat this marine . " <p> " I want to see it , " Henderson said . " I want to be there to pull for you , man , you the man with all the sh it , man , you the man , man ! " <p> " You ca n't ... I 've got to go to North Carolina . " <p> " I 'll ask for a transfer . " <p> " How long will that take ? " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> The captain stepped between them from out of nowhere . " What the hell 's going on ? You burning taxpayers ' money on that deck , Stubbock . You better get it in gear . " The captain for some reason had his helmet on . He hardly ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The captain turned away . " Sir ? " The captain stopped . The straps of his helmet were swinging . He turned around . " Can Henderson come too ? " <p> The captain got hot quick . He hardly ever got hot quick . Maybe the captain was losing his marbles . Maybe he 'd been away from those big boys in Tampa too long . Maybe the permanent vacation he was about to get would calm him down some . And a big fat monthly paycheck . With PX privileges . <p> " I do n't give a shit ! Go pack , Henderson . I 'll send your paperwork later . " He turned away . " Hit a whale . Jesus . Even Nimitz never hit a fucking whale . " He wandered on down the hallway , muttering loudly about how the president did n't know what a dork Admiral Zumo was . <p> Later : The chopper was thrumming and jetting thin black smoke with its blades slowly winding up , and it began with a small , piercing whine that grew into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every other sound , going **45;1603;TOOLONG ! The blades lifted , and Wayne and Henderson , bent over with their duffel bags , scurried across the deck with their clothes rippling and climbed aboard , and then it lifted off with its wheels rolling slightly and went about fifty feet aloft in front of the bridge and then turned above the deck and lifted higher and tilted and turned back toward the southwest , and its blades whipped into the night toward the great green pine forests of North Carolina , where lived platoons and companies and regiments of running jarhead warriors who sang an old song about fighting from the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli . <p> " Mayday ! " the pilot yelled into the microphone . " Mayday , mayday , mayday ! " He turned to the huddled crewmen behind him . " We 're going in , guys ! That ai n't no bullshit ! " <p> The chopper had tilted sickeningly and the lights were blinking and alarms like foghorns were screaming AH-AOOGA ! AH-AOOGA ! and people were yelling and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . Wayne and Henderson were almost on their backs against the bulkhead , and things were sliding down on them-ropes , flashlights , life preservers . They grabbed two of them and put them on . The engine sounded like it was crushing pieces of metal and spewing them out the big tailpipe , and black smoke was creeping into the cockpit from above . The pilot was struggling with the controls . The copilot was speaking calmly of their location into the radio mike , something about a zero four-niner . <p> Wayne could n't believe this shit was happening now . Not when he was almost back to land and could get away to go see her somehow , whether he had to go AWOL or could get a weekend pass and fly over to Memphis or whatever . All he 'd wanted was to get off the frigging ship and back on land , and now he was off the ship but Henderson was hugging him , clawing at him inside a helicopter . <p> " What we gon ' do , Wayne ? " he shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know what we 're gon na dol Looks like we 're riding this son of a bitch down , buddy ! " <p> " Well , how high up you think we are ? " Henderson wanted to know . <p> ' " I do n't knowl Pretty high , last time I looked ! " He grabbed one of the guys in the orange helmets by the coverall sleeve , and the guy jerked around with a terrified look on his face . His eyes were pale and green . " Hey , manI What 's our altitude ? " Wayne shouted . <p> " Holy moly ! " the pilot shouted . " There went the fucking oil pressure ! " <p> " She 's locking up ! " the copilot shouted , looking up . <p> " Plenty high enough to fuck us upl " the crewman shouted back . " I 'd say probably two hundred feet right now ! Even if he gets it down in one piece we 're ninety miles off the coast ! They might not ever find ust It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wayne said . The lights were blinking now . The entire machine sounded like it was coming apart . The pilot was trying to bring it down on its own before it fell , but steel was screeching and rivets were rattling and there was the acrid scent of metal burning , like what Wayne had smelled on the side of a road outside Bowling Green one fine May afternoon when the engine in his friend Doug 's VW Bug had melted into a lump . <p> Henderson shouted . " I cai n't do this shit ! I got to go home and see my baby , manl She ai n't but twenty-two months oldl What 'd I join the fuckin ' navy for ? See the world my ass ! I ever get my feet on dry land they can kiss my black assI " <p> Wayne was thinking about sharks . The pilot was yelling at the crew , seemed to be trying to herd them into some kind of effort , and it must have worked because they started pulling out inflatable rafts and extra life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterproof flashlights and ropes . Even in the dark Wayne could tell that the chopper was going rapidly toward the ocean . He was thinking : impact . <p> It came almost too soon for him to realize what was happening . The noise of hitting the water was too loud for the ears . A jolt harder than anything he 'd ever felt made Wayne slam his head into Henderson 's , just like a head-butt he 'd gotten in a smoker one night at Baltimore that had opened a cut above his left eye and made him lose on points to a guy he 'd already had down twice in the second round . There were the terrible sounds of the rotors hitting the ocean , and then they stopped , and the cold black water came rushing in . <p> It was totally dark . People were yelling for a few moments , splashing as the chopper sank . Wayne took a deep breath . And just like that , they were under , and sinking , and bubbles were rising and breaking against him . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot engine . He could feel Henderson clutching at him , but their lifejackets pushed them up against the roof or the side , and he could n't see where the door was . He felt somebody 's legs , and he grabbed for them , but the legs kicked away , and he felt a boot hit the side of his face . He could hear men strangling on water , their great screams of air coming out in bubbles he could not see . Somebody grabbed at him , and his hand closed over a head of short hair , thick and tightly curled . Henderson . Then a waterproof flashlight came on . He saw a crewman in an orange helmet going out the door , his boots kicking . The light shone on him , and he could see Henderson 's face . His cheeks were pooched out and his eyes were wild , but he was alive and holding his breath . Wayne got his hand around Henderson 's arm and looked to see one of the crewmen holding the flashlight for them , and together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . The opening loomed . The beam was dancing around inside the cabin of the helicopter , and he had a flash of the copilot still strapped into his seat , and the pilot beside him , their heads turned toward each other as if they were talking . But his air was almost gone , and he pulled with his hands and flowed out through the door with Henderson rising above him , the light trailing them from behind . An inflating raft rocketed up beside him toward the surface . Then another , turning and twisting as it filled . Gas , Wayne thought . He looked down to see the light emerging from the dark mass of the sinking chopper , a tiny yellow spot that was following them up , and he kicked harder ; then a great bubble rose beside him , and the light turned and started sinking toward the bottom of the ocean . There was only blackness above and blackness below and the desperate burning in his lungs , and then his face burst clear of the water . Henderson was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the air , at the dark clouds and a half moon in the sky , at the waves rolling by them and washing past them . The lifejackets pulled their faces out of the water . Bubbles kept rising around them . <p> " Wayne ! " Henderson yelled . " Wayne ! " <p> " I 'm right here ! I 'm here ! " <p> He could see Henderson . He was twenty feet away . There was n't much moonlight , but there was enough to see the inflated life rafts bobbing and floating away . His breath came in ragged gasps . He tasted salt in his mouth . But he gathered his breath to yell . " We got to get one of those rafts ! We 're dead if we do n't ! " <p> He could see Henderson shaking his head . He knew he needed to rest , but there might not be another chance . It hit him that his mother had no idea where he was . Henderson 's voice was weak . <p> " I cai n't , Wayne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He coughed hard to prove it . <p> " I 'm going after it , " Wayne said , and started stroking . But it was hard swimming with the lifejacket on . It was bulky , and it was hard to move his arms inside it . The rafts were fifty feet off already and moving away . He turned and swam toward Henderson , who had been yelling for him not to go . When he got to him , he slipped out of the jacket . " Hold on to mine , " he said . " I 've got to get that raft . " <p> " Do n't do it , Wayne , do n't take off , stay here Henderson started , but Wayne had already turned away and lowered his chin into the water . In school he 'd been pretty good , had come in second in the statewide competition at Cleveland once , before he 'd turned his physical gifts to boxing . This was as good a place as any to see if he still had a stroke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rafts looked like they were getting farther and farther away , and it was odd how they stayed together , like a pair of something that had decided to mate . He knew he would n't be able to see Henderson if he looked back , so he just kept swimming . He kept pulling the water past him with his hands , and he made his legs kick in a regular , steady thrust , and a flash of an old Tarzan movie went through his head , Johnny Weissmuller speeding like a sleek otter through the water , and after a while the rafts appeared to be a little closer . That only made him swim harder . When he realized he was going to make it he did n't slow down any , not until his hand closed over the rope that was made into the border of the raft . Then he pulled his arms up over the side and rested . His breath was coming very hard , and he could feel his heart beating wildly inside his chest . He knew adrenaline was going through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked around to see Henderson , but it was too dark . Jesus . The guy behind them . Shining the light for them to get out . Inflating two rafts . Just could n't hold his breath anymore . On his way to the bottom now , maybe already there . His family . They would n't know how it had happened for him . He could have saved himself first . But he had n't . And what about the other guy who went out ahead of them ? Where in the hell was he ? Were there only three of them left ? Out of what ? Four in the crew . Both the pilots . Him and Henderson . Eight . Three out of eight ? Five men dead who had just been alive with him and laughing and talking shit about all the poontang you could get in Bangkok on shore leave ? Was that possible ? <p> He 'd swallowed some water himself , and it felt like it had gone down into his lungs . He coughed for a while . He coughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The skin felt tight on his face where some of it was drying . <p> He hauled himself over the side and flopped down inside the rounded walls of the raft . He was lying in puddles of water . What was he going to paddle with ? It seemed like they 'd had a class on these things once a long time ago , but he had n't paid much attention because he knew he 'd never wind up in the water like this because his ship was n't going to sink because there was n't a war going on , and besides that he could swim . He looked around inside the raft . There was a rubber pouch on the side with a couple of snaps . Something hard and about three feet long was inside it . He got the snaps open and reached in for two paddles that looked like they were made of black plastic . OK . Now he could find Henderson and the other guy . <p> He got up on his knees and put the paddle in the water and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two lifejackets ; he 'd be OK for a while . He started yelling . " Henderson ! Hey Henderson Where you at ? " <p> There was no answer . The raft had turned some while he was holding on to it and then climbing into it , and now he was n't certain which direction he should go . So he kept yelling for Henderson . He 'd yell for a while , and then he 'd listen . <p> Above him the moon was scuttling behind the passing clouds , light and dark showing , light and dark . Then a big cloud came over and blocked the light completely , and all he could see around him was dark water rolling . <p> " Hey Henderson ! Hey man ! Where in the hell you at ? " <p> Oh shit . Oh holy shit . There were sharks in this fucking water , had to be . He had to get him out . He had to get him inside this raft before it got too late . He had to find the other guy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey man ! " <p> He was trying to figure what time it was . How much darkness left . He knew they 'd come looking , but a search party would n't have any chance of finding them until daylight . And there was no telling how far away from Henderson he might drift by then . <p> " Henderson ! Hey mau ! " He was almost crying . " You better fucking answer me ! Henderson ? " <p> But there was only the lapping of the black and ceaseless waves at the sides of the raft . And the ocean he was riding was so big . So very big . Empty as shit . <p> Author Affiliation
