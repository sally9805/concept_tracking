Today I am a teacher in Virginia . But I was born a Maasai warrior in Africa . // My people speak the Maa language . That is why we are called the Maasai . Many different groups make up the Maasai . We live in Kenya . It is a country in East Africa . We are nomads . We move around . We live where it is best for cattle . We live in places where there is good grass and water . Cows are our way of life . They give us milk and blood and sometimes meat to eat and hides to wear . They are our wealth . We do n't have money . We have cows . Some people may say that our society is primitive . But I think it is the best , fairest system . No one goes hungry . We take care of each other . We watch out for one another . If kids do wrong , any adult can correct them . That means everyone in the village is equal . The Pinching Man In almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pinching man . He punishes disobedient kids by pinching them . He pinches you really hard on the legs . Let me tell you : Once you are pinched , you remember it . The pinching man did not punish me often . I did not spend a lot of time in my village . The law in Kenya requires that each nomadic family send one child to school . Most of the time , I lived in a boarding school . We learned the same things in school that children learn all over the world-reading , writing , and math . At first we did n't have paper and pencils , so we learned to write with sticks in the dirt floor of the school . One of the problems nomads have with school is that we move our villages and the cattle . The school stays in one place . That means leaving the children behind . The first year , my village was near the school . I was able to go home easily . Every time the school closed for vacation , I had to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . The village might be five miles away , or it might be fifty . The Lion Story I remember one school vacation when I was 14 . It was December . My village was in the mountains . The cattle had been taken down to a camp in the lowlands . There is good grass there . But the area is known for its fierce lions . They roam freely there , as if they think they own the land . At the time , I had never come face-to-face with a lion . I had heard stories from all the young warriors . They told me , " Wow , you know yesterday we chased a lion . " And I always said , " Big deal . " What 's the big deal about a lion ? It 's just an animal . If I can defend myself against elephants or rhinos , I thought , why not a lion ? Cattle Camp I spent two days in the village with my mom . Then one of my brothers asked me to go down the mountain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 18 to 24 miles away . My spear was broken , so I left it home . I wore my nanga , which is a red cloth , tied around my waist . It took me all day to walk to the cattle camp . As soon as I got there , another brother told me that two lions were terrorizing the cattle camps . That evening when the cows got back from grazing , we had a lot of milk to drink . We were well fed . We sat around the fire and sang songs . We told stories . I told stories about school . The other boys were always curious to understand school . We went to bed around midnight . We all slept out under the stars-no beds . At night , it gets cold in those desert areas . For cover I used the nanga that I had worn during the day . But the night was not peaceful . During the middle of the night , a loud sound woke us . We all knew right away that a lion was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lion Attack Right then we heard a cow making a rasping sound . We knew that the lion had the cow by the throat . Cows were running everywhere . Then we heard another cow 's death cry from the other end of camp . We ran . But as we got closer , I told everyone to stop . " Look , if we keep on chasing this lion , he 's going to kill more and more , " I said . " Why do n't we let him eat what he has now , and tomorrow we will go hunting for him . " My brother thought it was a good idea . But my brother did not want me to stay around . He asked me to tell the people in other cattle camps about the lion . I refused to go . He sent the youngest boy instead . He was only about eight years old . Lion Hunt The next day , I took the little boy 's spear and walked out of the camp with the others . Barely 200 yards away were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , " We can do it . Be brave . " The female lion walked away . But the male got up and roared . I could see into his throat . I asked my brother , " Where 's that other camp ? " He told me , and I ran toward it . After that , everyone knew that I had run away . They thought I was a coward . Two Worlds Later I went back to school . School was hard . It was like I lived in two different worlds . I had to talk and dress one way at school . When I went home , I wore the kind of clothes the Maasai wear . I did well in school . When I finished school , I decided to go to college in America . I went to St. Lawrence University and Harvard University . Today I am a teacher at the Langley School in McLean , Virginia . Best of all , I always go home for vacations . I help my family herd cattle . Sometimes , my students and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help my people . And everyone knows I am not a coward .
