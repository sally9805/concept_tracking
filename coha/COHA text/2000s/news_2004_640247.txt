<p> Civil rights advocate Omar D. Blair , the first African-American president of the Denver Board of Education , died Thursday of congestive heart failure . He was 85 . <p> City leaders remembered Blair on Thursday as a Denver pioneer , a champion of education for all children regardless of their socioeconomic level . <p> Flags at the Denver City and County Building will fly at half-staff today in his memory . <p> ' Omar was a giant within the community and a giant in anything he did , ' said former Denver Mayor Wellington Webb , who last year proposed naming the Blair-Caldwell African-American Research Library in honor of Blair , his longtime friend and mentor , and Elvin Caldwell , the first black Denver City Council member . <p> ' Omar was a no-nonsense , let's-just-get- <p> the-job-done man , ' Webb said . ' When you look back on the life of Omar Blair , all you see is that he was the first one who made contributions , whatever city he was in , whatever state he was in - specifically , Denver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny guy . He had some great stories to tell . ' <p> Blair was born July 16 , 1918 . Tall and commanding at 6 feet 4 inches , he grew up in Denver during the 1920s , when the local Ku Klux Klan helped engineer the elections of Denver Mayor Ben Stapleton and Gov . Clarence Morley , who helped keep black residents firmly at the bottom of the social structure . <p> ' All of my relatives had some kind of menial job - cook , maid , chauffeur , ' Blair said in an oral history videotape recorded for the archives of the Blair-Caldwell Library . <p> ' Honorable professions , ' he said , ' but you could have a degree in law , and you were in bad shape in Denver , Colo . ' <p> Then , blacks had to use exterior fire-escape staircases to enter and exit Denver movie theaters . They could swim only once a week , on Friday evenings , in the city 's 20th Street Gymnasium pool . Afterward , the pool was emptied and refilled with fresh water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park Lake and selling them to restaurants . His mother and stepfather kept two apartments over a Welton Street drugstore , where ' we had a still in one apartment , and lived in another , ' Blair recalled in his oral history . He delivered the hootch to Denver speakeasies , hiding the bottles in his knickers . <p> ' We did whatever was necessary , ' he often said . <p> That included spending 11 of 12 years in Albuquerque , where a forward-thinking school superintendent required racially integrated schools . Blair was a straight-A student . <p> ' It was important for me to prove that I was as good as , if not better than , all my contemporary people , ' he said in the video interview . <p> When Blair graduated from Albuquerque High School in 1936 , he and his five African-American classmates had to sit in the back of the auditorium , behind the rest of the graduating class . <p> That affront was smoothed over years later when Blair was named the school 's ' Most Distinguished Graduate 1879-1979 . ' <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the University of California at Los Angeles , which Blair attended for two years . He and some classmates left when a military recruiting officer promised them a place in a new elite Army Air Forces corps for young black men . <p> Initially skeptical - they knew black military personnel historically were assigned menial cleaning and loading jobs - Blair and the others took a fierce , lifelong pride in belonging to the Tuskegee Airmen of the 332nd Fighter Group . <p> As a captain , Blair developed a reputation for accomplishing the impossible . <p> That included raiding a train carrying the Army 's gasoline shipments to get the fuel necessary for a last-minute bombing attack on Berlin , and authorizing his ' handpicked crew that was very efficient at procurement ' to trade beer for propellers , wings and other parts necessary to keep all of his pilots ' planes ready to fly . <p> After the war , Blair worked for his father 's Albuquerque dry-cleaning service . In 1951 , he was hired as a grievance examiner at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an equal-opportunity investigator , in 1970 . <p> Rachel Noel , the first African- <p> American to serve on the Denver school board , persuaded him to run for the board . <p> ' Twisted his arm , ' she said fondly Thursday , ' but he was willing . ' <p> With the help of Noel and other Denver desegregation advocates , Blair was elected to the board of education in 1973 . He served for the next 12 years , including four years as the president of an often bitterly contentious board . <p> The source of that contention : a 1970 court order that required the busing of Denver children to racially balance Denver schools . <p> ' We had to fight that busing day and night to get things done , ' Blair said in the video . <p> He hated the cumbersome phrase - ' massive forced cross- <p> town busing ' - that busing opponents , including three members of the school board , wedged into everyday lexicon . <p> Blair decided to refute the people who claimed that children would suffer by being bused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a back-to-basics elementary magnet school . He chose a school building in retiree-heavy Bonnie Brae , with only 12 neighborhood children , and told administrators to recruit the best teachers they could find . <p> ' And kids from all over Denver went there , and not one parent grumbled about how they got there - by bus , ' Blair said with satisfaction . He was board president at the time . <p> ' We put Knight Fundamental in there , and shook up this country . When the I-hate-busing people objected , we would say , ' Well , this is what we did . Kids from all social-economic levels , ' to show what they could achieve . ' <p> When court-ordered busing ended in 1995 , Blair philosophically told The Denver Post that busing had ' gone on long enough . Lord knows we did what we could to make it work . ' <p> Blair remained active until a few weeks ago . During his last decade , he won armloads of awards for his community service , which included founding the Greater Park Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rho Sorority Inc. and his involvement with establishing local ceremonies for the Martin Luther King Jr . holiday . <p> ' He never took his mind off the work of building the community and building children , ' said the Rev. Aaron Gray , Denver Public Schools ' top community relations officer , who considered Blair a role model . <p> ' From the battlefields of World War II to the boardroom of Denver Public Schools , Omar Blair broke barriers wherever he went - creating opportunities for the generations that followed , ' Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper said Thursday in a written statement . <p> ' A true Denver pioneer and hero , Omar Blair 's legacy of community service , social justice and racial harmony will never be forgotten , ' said Hickenlooper , who recently presented Blair with a proclamation declaring Dec. 20 , 2003 , as ' Omar Blair Day . ' <p> At the April 2003 dedication of the Blair-Caldwell library , Blair looked out at the city where black residents once hesitated to venture east of Humbolt Street and observed , ' This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school board , Blair liked to tell listeners that while others were bickering about busing , he and his pro-busing colleagues on the board quietly went about bringing Denver schools into a new era . <p> Under his direction , Denver schools received computers and a career education center . He named a new middle school for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr . and a northeast Denver elementary school , Marrama , in honor of a school custodian who was dying of cancer . When a man protested Blair 's decision to name the school after King , Blair eloquently dressed him down . <p> ' Do you think it 's equally important to name a school after a custodian - which is an honorable profession - as opposed to a Nobel Peace Prize winner having a school named after him ? ' Blair asked evenly . <p> ' What 's wrong with that ? Bye .

Patricia Wetmore , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denver ; and four grandchildren . One grandson preceded him in death .
