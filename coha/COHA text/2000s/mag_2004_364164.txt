All right , Mr. DeMille , " says aging actress Norma Desmond , played by aging actress Gloria Swanson , as she leans seductively into the camera in the final scene of the 1950 film classic Sunset Boulevard . " I 'm ready for my close-up . " If Norma were working in today 's high-definition television ( HDTV ) , she would be inching away from that camera . <P> As the number of shows filmed in HDTV grows , actors and actresses are facing the ugly truth : HDTV gives new meaning to the word close-up . In high definition , no wart , wrinkle or blemish is safe from the camera 's eye , forcing makeup artists to scramble for cover-ups . " Everything shows , " says veteran sitcom makeup man Tommy Cole . " Everything is clearer , and the contrast is sharper . Some people are very worried . " <P> Nowhere was the downside of high definition more apparent than at the Academy Awards in February , when the few viewers with HDTV caught Hollywood 's biggest stars working the red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 59 , ruggedly handsome on film , became downright old , especially next to his high-def-defying spouse Catherine Zeta-Jones , 34 . Even the thirtysomethings had their problems . Renee Zellweger 's lightly blotchy red face showed through her makeup . And gorgeous fashion model turned actress Uma Thurman took a hit : the blush on those high cheekbones looked exaggerated and clownlike in HD . <P> In the struggle to keep the stars flawless , television 's makeup artists are introducing a variety of new techniques and products . While heavy pancake makeup typically covers all sorts of sins on analog TV , high def calls for thinner , better-blended foundations . Too much powder can make a star look mummy-like . Ken Diaz , makeup boss for the PBS series American Family , which is filmed in HDTV , waters down his bases . " It 's a wash of color , like a stain , rather than a pigment , " he says . Lori Madrigal , chief makeup artist for CBS 's HD hit Joan of Arcadia , concedes that she no longer uses lip gloss on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she says . <P> For middle-aged actors , who are n't supposed to look that way , the battle is constant . On the set of NBC 's sitcom Happy Family , makeup artist Patty Bunch continuously applies light moisturizers with anti-shine creams to actress Christine Baranski 's face and lights the area around her eyes to make sure they do n't look too deep-set . The series ' hair stylist had to darken veteran actor John Larroquette 's graying hair because it was glaring white in high definition before a lighting solution was found . <P> Many makeup pros are literally spray-painting their clients ' faces , applying a thin layer of makeup to cover the surface with thousands of tiny dots ( think ink-jet printers ) that conceal flaws and do n't smudge . Others are working more closely than ever with lighting directors , hiding extra lights in cabinets and other secret places on a set so actors ' faces are bathed in more brightness and look softer . " I am always telling Christine , ' Keep your chin up . Stay in the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and their makeup illusionists are n't taking kindly to high def , but they realize that the technology will soon dominate television . Like it or not , they 're all going to have to be ready for their close-ups .  --  By Jeanne McDowell/Los Angeles
