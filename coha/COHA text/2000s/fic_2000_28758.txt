33 " Specks -- specks all over the third panel , see ?  - -  no , that one -- the second one up from the floor and I wanted to point this out to someone yesterday but a photo shoot intervened and Yaki Nakamari or whatever the hell the designer 's name is -- a master craftsman not -- mistook me for someone else so I could n't register the complaint , but , gentlemen -- and ladies -- there they are : specks , annoying , tiny specks , and they do n't look accidental but like they were somehow done by a machine -- so I do n't want a lot of description , just the story , streamlined , no frills , the lowdown : who , what , where , when and do n't leave out why , though I 'm getting the distinct impression by the looks on your sorry faces that why wo n't get answered -- now , come on , goddamnit , what 's the story ? " Nobody around here has to wait long for someone to say something . " Baby , George Nakashima designed this bar area , " JD quietly corrects me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yuki Nakamorti , I mean -- oh shit , Peyton , get me out of this . " " Yoki Nakamuri was approved for this floor , " Peyton says . " Oh yeah ? " I ask . " Approved by who ? " " Approved by , well , moi , " Peyton says . A pause . Glares targeted at Peyton and JD . " Who the fuck is Moi ? " I ask . " I have no fucking idea who this Moi is , baby . " " Victor , please , " Peyton says . " I 'm sure Damien went over this with you . " " Damien did , JD . Damien did , Peyton . But just tell me who Moi is , baby , " I exclaim . " Because I 'm , like , shvitzing . " " Moi is Peyton , Victor , " JD says quietly . " I 'm Moi , " Peyton says , nodding . " Moi is , um , French . " " Are you sure these specks are n't supposed to be here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe it 's supposed to be , oh , I do n't know , in or something ? " " Wait . " I raise a hand . " You 're saying these specks are in ? " " Victor -- we 've got a long list of things to check , baby . " JD holds up the long list of things to check . " The specks will be taken care of . Someone will escort the specks out of here . There 's a magician waiting downstairs . " " By tomorrow night ? " I roar . " By to-mor-row night , JD ? " " It can be handled by tomorrow , no ? " JD looks at Peyton , who nods . " Around here , tomorrow night ' means anywhere from five days to a month . Jesus , does anybody notice I 'm seething ? " " None of us have been exactly sedentary , Victor . " " I think the situation is simple enough : those "  - -  I point --  " are specks . Do you need someone to decipher that sentence for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay with it ? " The " reporter " from Details stands with us . Assignment : follow me around for a week . Headline : THE MAKING OF A CLUB . Girl : push-up bra , scads of eyeliner , a Soviet sailor 's cap , plastic flower jewelry , rolled-up copy of W tucked under a pale , worked-out arm . Uma Thurman if Uma Thurman was five feet two and asleep . Behind her , some guy wearing a Velcro vest over a rugby shirt and a leather windjammer follows us , camcording the scene . " Hey baby . " I inhale on a Marlboro someone 's handed me . " What do you think about the specks ? " Girl reporter lowers her sunglasses . " I 'm really not sure . " She thinks about what position she should take . " East Coast girls are hip , " I shrug . " I really dig those styles they wear . " " I do n't think I 'm really part of the story , " she says . " You think any of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " From the top floor , Beau leans over the railing and calls down , " Victor -- Chloe 's on line ten . " Girl reporter immediately lifts the W , revealing a notepad , on which she doodles something , predictably animated for a moment . I call up , staring intently at the specks : " Tell her I 'm busy . I 'm in a meeting . It 's an emergency . Tell her I 'm in a meeting and it 's an emergency . I 'll call her back after I put the fire out . " " Victor , " Beau calls down . " This is the sixth time she 's called today . This is the third time she 's called in the last hour . " " Tell her I 'll see her at Doppelganger 's at ten . " I kneel down , along with Peyton and JD , and run my hand along the panel , pointing out where the specks begin and end and then start up again . " Specks , man , look at these fuckers . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisper . " Jesus , they 're everywhere . " Suddenly I notice an entire new patch and yelp , gaping , " And I think they 're spreading . I do n't think that patch was here before ? I swallow , then croak in a rush , " My mouth is incredibly dry because of this -- could someone get me an Arizona diet iced tea in a bottle , not a can ? " " Did n't Damien discuss the design with you , Victor ? " JD asks . " Did n't you know the existence of these specks ? " " I do n't know anything , JD . Nothing , nada . Remember that . I ... know ... nothing . Never assume I know anything . Nada . Nothing . I know nothing , not a thing . Never --  " " I get it , I get it , " JD says wearily , standing up . " I really ca n't see anything , baby , " Peyton says , still on the floor . JD sighs . " Even Peyton ca n't see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his fucking sunglasses , " I snarl . " Spare me , man . " " I will not tolerate being called a vampire , Victor . " Peyton pouts . " What ? You tolerate being sodomized but not being called Dracula in jest ? Am I on the same planet ? Let 's move on . " I wave my arm , gesturing at something invisible . As the entire group follows me downstairs toward the third floor , the chef -- Bongo from Venezuela via Vunderbahr , Moonclub , Paddy-O and MasaMasa -- lights a cigarette and lowers his sunglasses while trying to keep up with me . " Victor , we must talk . " He coughs , waves smoke away . " Please , my feet are killing me . " The group stops . " Uno momento , Bongo , " I say , noticing the worried glances he 's throwing Kenny Kenny , who 's connected in some weird way to Glorious Foods and has yet to be informed he has nothing to do with catering tomorrow night 's dinner . Peyton , JD , Bongo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to do something , and since I 'm at a loss I peer over the third-floor railing . " Come on , guys . Shit , I mean I 've got three more floors and five more bars to check . Please , give me some space . This is all very hard . Those specks almost made me literally sick . " " Victor , no one would deny the existence of the specks , " Peyton says carefully . " But you have to place the specks within a , um , certain , well , context . " On one of the monitors lining the walls on the third floor , MTV , a commercial , Helena Christensen , " Rock the Vote . " " Beau ! " I yell up . " Beau ? Beau leans over the top railing . " Chloe says she 'll be at Metro CC at eleven-thirty . " " Wait , Beau -- Ingrid Chavez ? Has Ingrid Chavez RSVP 'd ? " I yell up . " I 'm checking -- wait , for the dinner ? " " Yes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cs for dinner . " " Oh my god I have got to speak to you , Victor , " Bongo says in an accent so thick I 'm unsure of its origin , grabbing my arm . " You must let me have my time with you . " " Bongo , why do n't you just get get the the hell out of here , " Kenny Kenny says , his face twisted . " Here , Victor , try a crouton . " I snatch one out of his hands . " Mmm , rosemary . Delish , dude . " " It is sage , Victor . Sage . " " You you sh-sh-should go to hell , " Bongo sputters . " And take that sickening crouton with you . " " Will both of you mos take a Xanax and shut the fuck up ? Go bake some pastries or something . Beau -- goddamnit ! Speak to me ! " " Naomi Campbell , Helena Christensen , Cindy Crawford , Sheryl Crow , David Charvet , Courteney Cox , Harry Connick , Jr. , Francisco Clemente @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas Calabro , Cristi Conway , Bob Collacello , Whitfield Crane , John Cusack , Dean Cain , Jim Courier , Roger Clemens , Russell Crowe , Tia Carrere and Helena Bonham Carter -- but I 'm not sure if she should be under B or C. " " Ingrid Chavez ! Ingrid Chavez ! " I shout up . " Has Ingrid Chavez fucking RSVP 'd or not ? " " Victor , celebs and their overly attentive PR reps are complaining that your answering machine is n't working , " Beau calls down . " They say it 's playing thirty seconds of Love Shack ' and then only five seconds to leave a message . " " It 's a simple question . Yes or No is the answer . What else could these people possibly have to say to me ? It 's not a difficult question : Are you coming to the dinner and the club opening or are you not ? Is that hard to grasp ? And you look just like Uma Thurman , baby . " " Victor , Cindy is not these people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irwin is not these people '  --  " " Beau ! How are the As shaping up ? Kenny Kenny , do n't pinch Bongo like that . " " All nine of them ? " Beau calls down . " Carol Alt , Pedro Almodovar , Dana Ashbrook , Kevyn Aucoin , Patricia , Rosanna , David and Alexis Arquette and Andre Agassi , but no Giorgio Armani or Pamela Anderson . " " Shit . " I light another cigarette , then look over at the Details girl . " Um , I mean that in a good way . " " So it 's like ... a good shit ? " she asks . " Uh-huh . Hey Beau ! " I call up . " Make sure all the monitors are either on that virtual-reality videotape or for god 's sake MTV or something . I passed a screen that had VH1 on it , and some fat hick in a ten-gallon hat was weeping --  " " Will you meet Chloe at Flowers -- sorry , Metro CC ? " Beau yells down . " Because I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll lie , " I scream up . " That 's all you ever do . " Then , after glancing casually at the Details girl : " Ask Chloe if she 's bringing Beatrice and Julie . " Silence from upstairs makes me cringe , then Beau asks , thoroughly annoyed , " Do you mean Beatrice Arthur and Julie Hagerty ? " " No , " I shout , gritting my teeth . " Julie Delpy and Beatrice Dalle . Spare me . Just do it , Beau . " " Beatrice Dalle 's shooting that Ridley Scott --  " " The speck thing has really gotten to me . You know why ? " I ask the Details girl . " Because there were ... a lot ? " " Nope . Because I 'm a perfectionist , baby . And you can write that down . In fact I 'll wait a minute while you do so . " Suddenly I rush back to the panel beneath the bar , everyone rushing back with me up the stairs , and I 'm wailing , " Specks ! Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean everyone 's acting like there 's a question as to whether these specks are an illusion or a reality . I think they 're pretty goddamn real . " " Reality is an illusion , baby , " JD says soothingly . " Reality is an illusion , Victor . " No one says anything until I 'm handed an ashtray , in which I stub out the cigarette I just lit . " That 's , uh , pretty heavy , " I say , looking at the girl reporter . " That 's pretty heavy , huh ? " She shrugs , rotates her shoulders , doodles again . " My reaction exactly , " I mutter . " Oh , before I forget , " JD says . " Jann Wenner ca n't make it , but he wants to send a "  - -  JD glances at his notepad --  " check anyway . " " A check ? A check for what ? " " Just a "  - -  JD glances at his pad again --  " a , um , check ? " " Oh god . Beau ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are wondering why we do n't have a whatchamacallit , " Peyton says . Then , after much finger snapping , " Oh yeah , a cause ! " " A cause ? " I moan . " Oh god , I can only imagine what kind of cause you 'd want . Scholarship fund for Keanu . Find Marky Mark a gay brain . Send Linda Evangelista to the rain forest so we can pounce on Kyle MacLachlan . No thank you . " " Victor , should n't we have a cause ? " JD says . " What about global warming or the Amazon ? Something . Anything . " " Passe . Passe . Passe . " I stop . " Wait -- Beau ! Is Suzanne DePasse coming ? " " What about AIDS ? " " Passe . Passe . " " Breast cancer ? " " Oh groovy , far out , " I gasp before slapping him lightly on the face . " Get serious . For who ? David Barton ? He 's the only one with tits anymore . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " JD says . " Something like Do n't Bungle the Jungle or --  " " Hey , do n't bungle my jungle , you little mo . " I consider this . " A cause , hmm ? Because we can "  - -  I mindlessly light another cigarette --  " make more money ? " " And let people have some fun , " JD reminds me , scratching at a tattoo of a little muscle man on his bicep . " Yeah , and let people have some fun . " I take a drag . " I 'm considering this , you know , even though the opening is in , oh , less than twenty-four hours . " " You know what , Victor ? " Peyton asks slyly . I 'm getting the , ah , perverse temptation , baby , to , ah -- now do n't get scared , promise ? " " Only if you do n't tell me who you 've slept with in the last week . " Wide-eyed , Peyton claps his hands together and gushes , " Keep the specks . " Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Save ... the specks ? " " Save the specks ? " JD gasps . " Yes , save the specks , " Peyton says . " Damien wants techno , and those little fellas can definitely be construed as techno . " " We all want techno , but we want techno without specks , " JD moans . The camcorder guy zooms in on the specks , and it 's very quiet until he says , yawning , " Far out . " " People people people . " I lift my hands up . " Is it possible to open this club without humiliating ourselves in the process ? " I start to walk away . " Because I 'm beginning to think it 's not possible . Comprende ? " " Victor , oh my god , please , " Bongo says as I walk away . " Victor , wait up . " Kenny Kenny follows , holding out a bag of croutons . " It 's just that this is all so ... so ... ' 89 ? " I blurt out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to keep up with me . " A triumphant year ! " I stop , pause , then turn slowly to face him . Peyton stands there looking hopefully up at me , quivering . " Uh , Peyton , you 're really whacked out , are n't you ? " I ask quietly . Shamefully , Peyton nods as if coaxed . He looks away . " You 've had a pretty tough life , right ? " I ask gently . " Victor , please . " JD steps in . " Peyton was joking about the specks . We 're not saving the specks . I 'm with you . They 're just not worth it . They die . " While lighting a gargantuan joint , camcorder guy shoots out the huge expanse of French windows , the lens staring at a view of a leafless Union Square Park , at a truck with a massive Snapple logo driving by , limousines parked at a curb . We are moving down another set of stairs , heading toward the bottom . " Will someone please just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specks . Bongo , go back to the kitchen . Kenny Kenny , you get a consolation prize . Peyton , make sure Kenny Kenny gets a couple of colanders and a nice flat spatula . " I wave them off , glaring . We leave Kenny Kenny behind , on the verge of tears , rubbing a shaky hand over the tattoo of Casper the Friendly Ghost on his bicep . " Ciao . " " Come on , Victor . The average life span of a club is what -- four weeks ? By the time we close , no one 's gon na notice them . " " If that 's your attitude , JD , there 's the door . " " Oh Victor , let 's be realistic -- or at least fake it . This is n't 1987 anymore . " " I 'm not in a realistic mood , JD , so spare me . " Passing a pool table , I grab the 8 ball and slam-roll it into the corner pocket . The group is moving farther down into the club . We 're now at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduces me to a huge black guy with wraparound sunglasses standing by the front entrance eating takeout sushi . " Victor , this is Abdullah , but we shall call him Rocko , and he 's handling all the security and he was in that TLC video directed by Matthew Ralston . That toro looks good . " " My middle name is Grand Master B. " " His middle name is Grand Master B , " JD says . " We shook hands last week in South Beach , " Abdullah tells me . " That 's nice , Abdullah , but I was n't in South Beach last week even though I 'm semi-famous there . " I glance over at the Details girl . " You can write that down . " " Yeah man , you were in the lobby of the Flying Dolphin , getting your photo taken , " Rocko tells me . " You were surrounded by clams . " But I 'm not looking at Rocko . Instead my eyes have focused on the three metal detectors that line the foyer , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You did , um , know about these , right ? " JD asks . A meek pause . " Damien ... wants them . " " Damien wants what ? " " Um . " Peyton gestures with his arms as if the metal detectors were prizes . " These . " " Well , why do n't we just throw in a baggage check-in , a couple of stewardesses and a DC-10 ? I mean , what in the hell are these ? " " This is security , man , " Abdullah says . " Security ? Why do n't you just spend the night frisking the celebrities as well ? " I ask . " What ? You think this is a party for felons ? " " Mickey Rourke and Johnny Depp both RSVP 'd yes for dinner , " Peyton whispers in my ear . " If you 'd like us to frisk the guests --  " Rocko starts . " What ? I 'm gon na have Donna Karan frisked ? I 'm gon na have Marky Mark frisked ? I 'm gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't think so . " " No , baby , " Peyton says . " You 're going to have the metal detectors so Diane Von Furstenberg and Marky Mark are n't frisked . " " Chuck Pfeiffer has a metal plate in his goddamned head ! Princess Cuddles has a steel rod in her leg ? " I shout . JD tells the girl reporter , " Skiing accident in Gstaad , and do n't ask me how to spell that . " " What 's gon na happen when Princess Cuddles walks in through one of these things and alarms go off and buzzers and lights and  --  Jesus , she 'll have a fucking heart attack . Does anybody really want to see Princess Cuddles have a coronary ? " " On the guest list we 'll mark down that Chuck Pfeiffer has a metal plate in his head and that Princess Cuddles has a steel cod in her leg , " Peyton says , mindlessly writing it down on a notepad . " Listen , Abdullah . I just want to make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want in . I do n't want anyone passing out invites to other clubs . I do n't want some little waif mo handing Barry Diller an invite to Spermbar during dinner -- got it ? I do n't want anyone passing out invites to other clubs . " " What other clubs ? " Peyton and JD wail . " There are n't any other clubs ! " " Oh spare me , " I wail back , moving across the first floor . " Jesus -- you think Christian Laetner is gon na fit under one of those things ? " It gets darker as we move into the back of the first floor , toward the staircase that leads to one of the dance floors located in the basement . From the top floor , Beau calls down , " Alison Poole on line fourteen . She wants to speak to you now , Victor . " Everyone looks away as the Details girl writes something down on her little notepad . Camcorder guy whispers something and she nods , still writing . Somewhere old C + C Music Factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell her I 'm on line seven . " " She says it 's very important , " Beau drones on in monotone . I pause to look at the rest of the group , everyone looking anywhere but at me . Peyton whispers something to JD , who nods curtly . " Hey , watch that ! " I snap . I follow Camcorder 's lens to a row of sconces he 's filming and wait for Beau , who finally leans over the top-floor railing and says , " A miracle : she relented . She 'll see you at six . " " Okay , folks . " I suddenly turn around to face the group . " I 'm calling a sidebar . Bongo , you are excused . Do not discuss your testimony with anyone . Go . JD , come over here . I need to whisper something to you . The rest of you may stand by that bar and look for specks . Camcorder man -- turn that away from us . We 're taking five . " I pull JD over to me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about Mica not being around and us being unable to get ahold of her , please for the love of god do n't bring it up now , because we can find another DJ --  " " Shut up . It 's not about Mica . " I pause . " But wait , where is Mica ? " " Oh god , I do n't know . She DJ 'd at Jackie 60 on Tuesday , then did Edward Furlong 's birthday party , and now poof . " " What does that mean ? What does poof mean ? " " She 's disappeared . No one can find her . " " Well , shit , JD . What are we -- no , no -- you are gon na fix this , " I tell him . " I have something else I want to talk about . " " If Kenny Kenny 's going to sue us ? " " No . " " The seating chart for dinner ? " " No . " " The awfully cute magician downstairs ? " " Jesus , no . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um , personal problem . I need your advice . " " Oh , do n't drag me into anything sick , Victor , " JD pleads . " I just ca n't take being dragged into anything too sick . " " Listen ... " I glance over at the Details girl et al. , slouching against the bar . " Have you heard anything about a ... photograph ? " " A photograph of who ? " he exclaims . " Shhh , shut up . Jesus . " I look around . " Okay , even though you think Erasure is a good band , I think I can still trust you . " " They are , Victor , and --  " " Someone 's got a , let 's just say , incriminating photo of me and a certain young "  --  I cough --  " young lady , and I need you to find out if it 's , um , going to be printed sometime in the near future and maybe even tomorrow in one of the city 's least respectable but still most widely read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's about it . " " I suppose you could be more vague , Victor , but I 'm used to it , " JD says . " Just give me twenty seconds to decode this and I 'll get back to you . " " I do n't have twenty seconds . " " The young lady I 'm supposing -- no , I 'm hoping -- is Chloe Byrnes , your girlfriend ? " " On second thought , take thirty seconds . " " Is this a That 's Me in the Corner/That 's Me in the Spotlight moment ? " " Okay , okay , let me clarify : a compromising photo of a certain happening guy with a girl who ... and it 's not like that bad or anything . Let 's just say this girl attacked him at a premiere last week in Central Park and someone unbeknownst to them got a , um , photo of this and it would look ... strange since I am the subject of this photograph ... I have a feeling that if I make the inquiry it will be -- ahem -- misunderstood .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Chloe will see you at nine-thirty at Doppelganger 's ! " " What happened to Flowers ? I mean eleven-thirty at Metro CC ? " I yell back up . " What happened to ten o'clock at Cafe Tabac ? " A longish pause . " She now says nine-thirty at Bowery Bar . That 's the end of it , Victor . " Then silence . " What horrible thing do you want me to do ? " JD pauses . " Victor , would this photo -- if published -- screw up this guy 's relationship with a certain young model named Chloe Byrnes and a certain volatile club owner of ... oh , let 's just say , hypothetically , this club , whose name is Damien Nutchs Ross ? " " But that is n't the problem . " I pull JD closer and , surprised , he winks and bats his eyes and I have to tell him , " Do n't get any ideas . " I sigh , breathe in . " The problem is that a photo exists . A certain cretinous gossip columnist is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Princess Cuddles having a heart attack is bad ... that 's nothing . " I keep looking over my shoulder , finally telling everyone , " We have to go downstairs to check the magician . Excuse us . " " But what about Matthew Broderick ? " Peyton asks . " What about the salads ? " " He can have two ! " I shout as I whisk JD down the long steep ramp of stairs heading into the basement , the light getting dimmer , both of us moving carefully . JD keeps babbling . " You know I 'm here for you , Victor . You know I put the stud back in star-studded . You know I 've helped pack this party to the rafters with desirable celebs . You know I 'll do anything , but I ca n't help you on this because of --  " " JD . Tomorrow in no particular order I 've got a photo shoot , a runway show , an MTV interview with House of Style , ' lunch with my father , band practice . I even have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Plus this dump is opening . I -- have -- no -- time . " " Victor , as usual I 'll see what I can do . " JD maneuvers down the stairs hesitantly . " Now about the magician --  " " Fuck it . Why do n't we just hire some clowns on stilts and bus in an elephant or two ? " " He does card tricks . He just did Brad Pitt 's birthday at Jones in L.A. " " He did ? " I ask , suspicious . " Who was there ? " " Ed Limato . Mike Ovitz . Julia Ormond . Madonna . Models . A lot of lawyers and fun ' people . " It gets even colder as we near the bottom of the staircase . " I mean , " JD continues , " I think comparatively it 's pretty in . " " But in is out , " I explain , squinting to see where we 're heading . It 's so cold our breath steams , and when I touch the banister it feels like ice . " What are you saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " " In is ... not in anymore ? " JD asks . " Is that it ? " I glance at him as we descend the next flight of stairs . " No , in is out . Out is in . Simple , non ? " JD blinks twice , shivering , both of us moving farther down into the darkness . " See , out is in , JD . " " Victor , I 'm really nervous as it is , " he says . " Do n't start with me today . " " You do n't even have to think about it . Out is in . In is out . " " Wait , okay . In is out ? Do I have that down so far ? " At the bottom , it is so cold that I 've noticed candles do n't even stay lit , they keep going out as we pass , and the TV monitors show only static . At the foot of the stairs by the bar , a magician who looks like a young German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deck of cards , slump-shouldered , smoking a small joint , drinking a Diet Coke , wearing ripped jeans and a pocket T , the back-to-basics look , exaggeratedly sloppy , the rows of empty champagne glasses behind him reflecting what little light exists down here . " Right . Out is in . " " But then what exactly is in ? " JD asks , his breath steaming . " Out is , JD . " " So ... in is not in ? " " That 's the whole p-p-point . " It 's so cold my biceps are covered with goose bumps . " But then what 's out ? It 's always in ? What about specifics ? " " If you need this defined for you , maybe you 're in the wrong world , " I murmur . The magician gives us the peace sign in a vague way . " You did Brad Pitt 's party ? " I ask . The magician makes a deck of cards , the stool he 's sitting on , one of my slippers and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abracadabra . " " You did Brad Pitt 's party ? " I sigh . JD nudges me and points up . I notice the massive red swastika painted onto the domed ceiling above us . " I suppose we should probably get rid of that . " 32 Zigzagging toward Chemical Bank by the new Gap it 's a Wednesday but outside feels Mondayish and the city looks vaguely unreal , there 's a sky like from October 1973 or something hanging over it and right now at 5:30 this is Manhattan as Loud Place : jackhammers , horns , sirens , breaking glass , recycling trucks , whistles , booming bass from the new Ice Cube , unwanted sound trailing behind me as I wheel my Vespa into the bank , joining the line at the automated teller , most of it made up of Orientals glaring at me as they move aside , a couple of them leaning forward , whispering to each other . " What 's the story with the moped ? " some jerk asks . " Hey , what 's the story with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card , it 's not taking out any cash , so chill out . Jesus . " Only one out often cash machines seems to have any cash in it , so while waiting I have to look up at my reflection in the panel of steel mirrors lining the columns above the automated tellers : high cheekbones , ivory skin , jet-black hair , semi-Asian eyes , a perfect nose , huge lips , defined jawline , ripped knees in jeans , T-shirt under a long-collar shirt , red vest , velvet jacket , and I 'm slouching , Rollerblades slung over my shoulder , suddenly remembering I forgot where I 'm supposed to meet Chloe tonight , and that 's when the beeper goes off . It 's Beau . I snap open the Panasonic EBH 70 and call him back at the club . " I hope Bongo 's not having a fit . " " It 's the RSVPs , Victor . Damien 's having a fit . He just called , furious --  " " Did you tell him where I was ? " " How could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are ? " Pause . " Where are you ? Damien was in a helicopter . Actually stepping out of a helicopter . " " I do n't even know where I am , Beau . How 's that for an answer ? " The line moves up slowly . " Is he in the city ? " " No . I said he was in a helicopter . I said that **28;230;TOOLONG . " " But where was the heli-cop-ter ? " " Damien thinks things are getting totally fucked up . We have about forty for dinner who have not RSVP 'd , so our seating list might be interpreted as meaningless . " " Beau , that depends on how you define meaningless . " A long pause . " Do n't tell me it means a bunch of different things , Victor . For example , here 's how the O situation is shaping up : Tatum O'Neal , Chris O'Donnell , Sinead O'Connor and Conan O'Brien all yes but nothing from Todd Oldham , who I hear is being stalked and really freaking out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I whisper . " That 's because they 're all doing the shows . I 'll talk to Todd tomorrow -- I 'll see him at the show-but I mean what is going on , Beau ? Conan O'Brien is coming but Todd Oldham and Carrie Otis might not ? That just is n't an acceptable scenario , baby , but I 'm in an automated teller right now with my Vespa and I ca n't really speak -- hey , what are you looking at ?  - -  but I do n't want Chris O'Donnell anywhere at my table for dinner . Chloe thinks he 's too fucking cute and I just do n't need that kind of awful shit tomorrow night . " " Uh-huh . Right , no Chris O'Donnell , okay , got that . Now , Victor , first thing tomorrow we 've got to go over the big ones , the Ms and the Ss --  " " We can pull it together . Do n't weep , Beau . You sound sad . It is now my turn to get some cash . I must go and --  " " Wait ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G but not for the dinner unless he 's coming with Cindy Crawford then he is invited to the dinner and you then know which consonant , baby . " " Victor , you try dealing with Cindy 's publicist . You try getting an honest answer out of Antonio Sabato , Jr . ' s publicist --  " I click off , finally push in my card , punch in the code ( COOLGUY ) and wait , thinking about the seating arrangements at tables 1 and 3 , and then green words on a black screen tell me that there is no cash left in this account ( a balance of minus $143 ) and so therefore it wo n't give me any money and I blew my last cash on a glass-door refrigerator because Elle Decor did a piece on my place that never ran so I slam my fist against the machine , moan " Spare me " and since it 's totally useless to try this again I rustle through my pockets for a Xanax until someone pushes me away and I roll the moped back outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light in front of Barneys , and Bill Cunningham snaps my picture , yelling out , " Is that a Vespa ? " and I give him thumbs-up and he 's standing next to Holly , a curvy blonde who looks like Patsy Kensit , and when we smoked heroin together last week she told me she might be a lesbian , which in some circles is pretty good news , and she waves me over wearing velvet hot pants , red-and-white-striped platform boots , a silver peace symbol and she 's ultrathin , on the cover of Mademoiselle this month , and after a day of doing shows at Bryant Park she 's looking kind of frantic but in a cool way . " Hey Victor ! " She keeps motioning even when I 've pulled the Vespa up to the curb . " Hey Holly . " " It 's Anjanette , Victor . " " Hey Anjanette , what 's up pussycat ? You 're looking very Uma-ish . Love the outfit . " " It 's retro-gone-wacko . I did six shows today . I 'm exhausted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw you at the Calvin Klein show giving Chloe moral support . Which was so cool of you . " " Baby , I was n't at the Calvin Klein show but you 're still looking very Uma-ish . " " Victor , I 'm positive you were at the Calvin Klein show . I saw you in the second row next to Stephen Dorff and David Salle and Roy Liebenthal . I saw you pose for a photo on 42nd Street , then get into a black scary car . " Pause , while I consider this scenario , then : " The second fucking row ? No way , baby . You have n't started your ignition yet . Will I see yon tomorrow night , baby ? " " I 'm coming with Jason Priestley . " " Why are n't you coming with me ? Am I the only one who thinks Jason Priestley looks like a little caterpillar ? " " Victor , that 's not nice , " she pouts . " What would Chloe think ? " " She thinks Jason Priestley looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thought . " The fucking second row ? " " That 's not what I meant , " Anjanette says . " What would Chloe think of --  " " Spare me , baby , but you 're supergreat . " I start the Vespa up again . " Take your passion and make it happen . " " I 've heard you 've been naughty anyway , so I 'm not surprised , " she says , tiredly wagging her finger at me , which Scooter , the bodyguard who looks like Marcellus from Pulp Fiction , interprets as " move closer . " " What do you mean by that , pussycat ? " I ask . " What have you heard ? " Scooter whispers something , pointing at his watch , while Anjanette lights a cigarette . " There 's always a car waiting . There 's always a Steven Meisel photo shoot . Jesus , how do we do it , Victor ? How do we survive this mess ? " A gleaming black sedan rolls forward and Scooter opens the door . " See you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just happen to be holding and start pulling away from the curb . " Oh Victor , " she calls out , handing Scooter the French tulip . " I got the job ! I got the contract . " " Great , baby . I got ta run . What job , you crazy chick ? " " Guess ? . " " Matsuda ? Gap ? " I grin , limousines honking behind me . " Baby , listen , see you tomorrow night . " " No . Guess ? . " " Baby , I already did . You 're mind-tripping me . " " Guess ? , Victor , " she 's shouting as I pull away . " Baby , you 're great , " I shout back . " Call me . Leave a message . But only at the club . Peace . " " Guess ? , Victor ! " she calls out . " Baby , you 're a face to watch , " I say , already putting a Walkman on , already on 61st . " A star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let 's have drinks at Monkey Bar after the shows are over on Sunday ! " I 'm speaking to myself now and moving toward Alison 's place . Passing a newsstand by the new Gap , I notice I 'm still on the cover of the current issue of YouthQuake , looking pretty cool -- the headline 27 AND HIP in bold purple letters above my smiling , expressionless face , and I 've just got to buy another copy , but since I do n't have any cash there 's no way . 31 From 72nd and Madison I called Alison 's doorman , who has verified that outside her place on 80th and Park Damien 's goons are not waiting in a black Jeep , so when I get there I can pull up to the entrance and roll my Vespa into the lobby , where Juan -- who 's a pretty decent-looking guy , about twenty-four -- is hanging out in uniform . As I give him the peace sign , wheeling the moped into the elevator , Juan comes out from behind the front desk . " Hey Victor , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking , following me . " I mean , last week you said you would and --  " " Hey baby , it 's cool , Juan , it 's cool , " I say , inserting the key , unlocking the elevator , pressing the button for the top floor . Juan presses another button , to keep the door open . " But man , you said he 'd see me and also set up a meeting with --  " " I 'm setting it up , buddy , it 's cool , " I stress , pressing again for the top floor . " You 're the next Markus Schenkenberg . You 're the white Tyson . " I reach over and push his hand away . " Hey man , I 'm Hispanic --  " He keeps pressing the Door Open button . " You 're the next Hispanic Markus Schenkenberg . You 're the , um , Hispanic Tyson . " I reach over and push his hand away again . " You 're a star , man . Any day of the week . " " I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey man , spare me . " I grin . " Afterthought ' is n't in this guy 's vocabulary , " I say , pointing at myself . " Okay , man , " Juan says , letting go of the Door Open button and offering a shaky thumbs-up . " I , like , trust you . " The elevator zips up to the top floor , where it opens into Alison 's penthouse . I peer down the front hallway , do n't see or hear the dogs , then quietly wheel the Vespa inside and lean it against a wall in the foyer next to a Vivienne Tam sofa bed . I tiptoe silently toward the kitchen but stop when I hear the hoarse breathing of the two chows , who have been intently watching me from the other end of the hallway , quietly growling , audible only now . I turn around and offer them a weak smile . I can barely say " Oh shit " before they both break out into major scampering and rush at their target : me . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth , nipping at my knees , pawing at my calves , barking furiously . " Alison ! Alison ! " I call out , trying desperately to bat them away . Hearing her name , they both stop barking . Then they glance down the hallway to see if she 's coming . After a pause , when they hear no sign of her -- we 're frozen in position , red chow standing on back legs , its paws in my groin , black chow down on its front paws with Gucci boot in mouth -- they immediately go to work on me again , growling and basically freaking out like they always do . " Alison ! " I scream . " Jesus Christ ! " Gauging the distance from where I 'm at to the kitchen door , I decide to make a run for it , and when I bolt , the chows scamper after me , yelping , biting at my ankles . I finally make it into the kitchen and slam the door , hear both of them skidding across the marble floor into the door with two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and attack the door . Shaken , I open a Snapple , down half of it , then light a cigarette , check for bites . I hear Alison clapping her hands , and then she walks into the kitchen , naked beneath an open Aerosmith tour robe , a cell phone cradled in her neck , an unlit joint in her mouth . " Mr. Chow , Mrs. Chow , down , down , goddamnit , down . " She hurls the dogs into the pantry , pulls a handful of colored biscuits from the robe and throws them at the dogs before slamming the pantry door shut , the sounds of the dogs fighting over the biscuits cut mercifully short . " Okay , uh-huh , right , Malcolm McLaren ... Yeah , no , Frederic Fekkai . Yeah . Everybody 's hung over , babe . " She scrunches up her face . " Andrew Shue and Leonardo DiCaprio ? ... What ? ... Oh baby , no-o-o way . " Alison winks at me . " You 're not at a window table at Mortimer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ciao . " She clicks off the cellular and carefully places the joint on the counter and says , " That was a three-way with Dr. Dre , Yasmine Bleeth and Jared Leto . " " Alison , those two little shits tried to kill me , " I point out as she jumps up and wraps her legs around my waist . " Mr. and Mrs. Chow are n't little shits , baby . " She clamps her mouth onto mine as I stumble with her toward the bedroom . Once there she falls to her knees , rips open my jeans and proceeds to expertly give me head , deep-throating in an unfortunately practiced way , grabbing my ass so hard I have to pry one of her hands loose . I take a last drag off the cigarette that I 'm still holding , look around for a place to stub it out , find a half-empty Snapple bottle , drop in what 's left of the Marlboro , hear it hiss . " Slow down , Alison , you 're moving too fast , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth and , looking up at me , says in a low , " sexy " voice , " Urgency is my specialty , baby . " She suddenly gets up , drops the robe and lies back on the bed , spreading her legs , pushing me down onto a floor littered with random issues of WWDs , my right knee crumpling a back-page photo of Alison and Damien and Chloe and me at Naomi Campbell 's birthday party , sitting in a cramped booth at Doppelganger 's , and then I 'm nibbling at a small tattoo on the inside of a muscular thigh and the moment my tongue touches her she starts coming -- once , twice , three times . Knowing where this will not end up , I jerk off a little until I 'm almost coming and then I think , Oh screw it , I do n't really have time for this , so I just fake it , moaning loudly , my head between her legs , movement from my right arm giving the impression from where she lies that I 'm actually doing something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our rendezvous spots have included the atrium at Remi , room 101 at the Paramount , the Cooper-Hewitt Museum . I climb onto the bed and lie there , pretending to pant . " Baby , where did you learn to give head like that ? Sotheby 's ? Oh man . " I reach over for a cigarette . " So wait . That 's it ? " She lights a joint , sucks in on it so deeply that half of it turns to ash . " What about you ? " " I 'm happy . " I yawn . " Just as long as you do n't bring out that , um , leather harness and Sparky the giant butt plug . " I get off the bed and pull my jeans and Calvins up and move over to the window , where I lift a venetian blind . Down on Park , between 79th and 80th , is a black Jeep with two of Damien 's goons sitting in it , reading the new issue of what looks like Interview with Drew Barrymore on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other like a white Damon Wayans . Alison knows what I 'm seeing and from the bed says , " Do n't worry , I have to meet Grant Hill for a drink at Mad.61 . They 'll follow and then you can escape . " I flop onto the bed , flip on Nintendo , reach for the controls and start to play Super Mario Bros . " Damien says that Julia Roberts is coming and so is Sandra Bullock , " Alison says vacantly . " Laura Leighton and Halle Berry and Dalton James . " She takes another hit off the joint and hands it to me . " I saw Elle Macpherson at the Anna Sui show and she says she 'll be there for the dinner . " She 's flipping through a copy of Detour with Robert Downey , Jr. , on the cover , legs spread , major crotch shot . " Oh , and so is Scott Wolf . " " Shhh , I 'm playing , " I tell her . " Yoshi 's eaten four gold coins and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrate . " " Oh my god , who gives a shit , " Alison sighs . " We 're dealing with a fat midget who rides a dinosaur and saves his girlfriend from a pissed-off gorilla ? Victor , get serious . " " It 's not his girlfriend . It 's Princess Toadstool . And it 's not a gorilla , " I stress . " It 's Lemmy Koopa of the evil Koopa clan . And baby , as usual , you 're missing the point . " " Please enlighten me . " " The whole point of Super Mario Bros. is that it mirrors life . " " I 'm following . " She checks her nails . " God knows why . " " Kill or be killed . " " Uh-huh . " " Time is running out . " " Gotcha . " " And in the end , baby , you ... are ... alone . " " Right . " She stands up . " Well , Victor , that really captures the spirit of our relationship , honey . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you had to be interviewed by Worth magazine on the topic of Damien 's Nintendo stock , you 'd want to kill Yoshi too . " " I guess this is all just beyond the realm of your experience , " I murmur . " Huh ? " " What are you doing tonight for dinner ? " she calls out from the closet . " Why ? Where 's Damien ? " " In Atlantic City . So the two of us can go out since I 'm sure Chloe is tres exhausted from all dat wittle modeling she had to do today . " " I ca n't , " I call back . " I 've got to get to bed early . I 'm skipping dinner . I 've got to go over -- oh shit -- seating arrangements . " " Oh , but baby , I want to go to Nobu tonight , " she whines from the closet . " I want a baby shrimp tempura roll . " " You are a baby shrimp tempura roll , " I whine back . The phone rings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a beep . " Hi , Alison , it 's Chloe calling back . " I roll my eyes . " Amber and Shalom and I have to do something for Fashion TV at the Royalton and then I 'm having dinner with Victor at Bowery Bar at nine-thirty . I 'm so so tired ... did shows all day . Okay , I guess you 're not there . Talk to you soon -- oh yeah , you have a pass backstage for Todd 's show tomorrow . Bye-bye . " The machine clicks off . Silence from the closet , then , low and laced with fury , " Seating arrangements ? **33;260;TOOLONG ? " " You ca n't keep me in your penthouse , " I say . " I 'm going back to my plow . " " You 're having dinner with her ? " she screams . " Honey , I had no idea . " Alison walks out of the closet holding a Todd Oldham wraparound dress in front of her and waits for my reaction , showing it off : not-so-basic black-slash-beige , strapless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Todd Oldham , baby , " I finally say . " I 'm wearing it tomorrow night . " Pause . " It 's an original , " she whispers seductively , eyes glittering . " I 'm gon na make your little girlfriend look like shit ! " Alison reaches over and slaps the controls out of my hand and turns on a Green Day video and dances over to the Vivienne Tam -- designed mirror , studying herself holding the dress in it , and then completes a halfhearted swirl , looking very happy but also very stressed . I check my nails . It 's so cold in this apartment that frost accumulates on the windows . " Is it just me or am I getting chilly in here ? " Alison holds the dress up one more time , squeals maniacally and rushes back into the closet . " What did you say , baby ? " " Did you know vitamins strengthen your nails ? " " Who told you that , baby ? " she calls out . " Chloe did , " I mutter , biting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my god , she 's so stupid . " " She just got back from the MTV awards . She had a nervous breakdown before it , y'know , so be reasonable . " " Ma-jor , " Alison calls out . " Her smack days are behind her , I take it . " " Just be patient . She 's very unstable , " I say . " And yes , her smack days are behind her . " " No help from you , I 'm sure . " " Hey , she got a huge amount of help from me , " I say , sitting up , paying more attention now . " If it was n't for me she might be dead , Alison . " " If it was n't for you , pea brain , she might not have shot up the junk in the first fucking place . " " She did n't shoot ' anything , " I stress . " It was a purely nasal habit . " Pause , check my fingernails again . " She 's just very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blackhead and wants to kill herself ? " " Hey , who would n't ? " I sit up a little more . " No Vacancy . No Vacancy . No Vac --  " " Axl Rose and Prince both wrote songs about her , may I remind you . " " Yeah , Welcome to the Jungle ' and Let 's Go Crazy . ' " Alison walks out of the closet wrapped in a black towel and waves me off . " I know , I know , Chloe was born to model . " " Do you think your jealousy 's giving me a hard-on ? " " No , only my boyfriend does that . " " Hey , no way do I want to get it on with Damien . " " Jesus . As usual , you 're so literal-minded . " " Oh god , your boyfriend 's a total crook . A blowhard . " " My boyfriend is the only reason , my little himbo , that you are in business . " " That 's bullshit , " I shout . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month . " " Exactly . " Alison suddenly relents and moves over to the bed and sits down next to me , gently taking my hand . " Victor , you auditioned for all three Real World 's , and MTV rejected you all three times . " She pauses sincerely . " What does that tell you ? " " Yeah , but I 'm one fucking phone call away from Lorne Michaels . " Alison studies my face , my hand still in hers , and smiling , she says , " Poor Victor , you should see just how handsome and dissatisfied you look right now . " " A hip combo , " I mutter sullenly . " It 's nice that you think so , " she says vacantly . " Looking like some deformed schmuck and suicidal 's better ? " I tell her . " Christ , Alison , get your fucking priorities straightened out . " " My priorities straightened out ? " she asks , stunned , letting go of my hand and placing her own to her chest . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teenager . " Do n't you understand ? " I get up from the bed , lighting a cigarette , pacing . " Shit . " " Victor , tell me what you 're so worried about . " " You really want to know ? " " Not really but yes . " She walks over to the armoire and pulls out a coconut , which I totally take in stride . " My fucking DJ 's disappeared . That 's what . " I inhale so hard on the Marlboro I have to put it out . " No one knows where the hell my DJ is . " " Mica 's gone ? " Alison asks . " Are you sure she 's not in rehab ? " " I 'm not sure of anything , " I mutter . " That 's for sure , baby , " she says faux-soothingly , falling onto the bed , looking for something , then her voice changes and she yells , " And you lie ! Why did n't you tell me you were in South Beach last weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend , and I was n't at the fucking Calvin Klein show either . " Finally the time has come : " Alison , we 've got to talk about something --  " " Do n't say it . " She drops the coconut into her lap and holds up both hands , then notices the joint on her nightstand and grabs it . " I know , I know , " she intones dramatically . " There is a compromising photo of you with a girl " she bats her eyes cartoonishly --  " supposedly moi , yada yada yada , that 's going to fuck up your relationship with that dunce you date , but it will also "  - -  and now , mock-sadly , lighting the joint --  " fuck up the relationship with the dunce I date too . So " she claps her hands --  " rumor is it 's running in either the Post , the Trib or the News tomorrow . I 'm working on it . I have people all over it . This is my A-number-one priority . So do n't worry " she inhales , exhales --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " She spots what she was looking for , lost in the comforter , and grabs it : a screwdriver . " Why , Alison ? Why did you have to attack me at a movie premiere ? " I wail . " It takes two , you naughty boy . " " Not when you 've knocked me unconscious and are sitting on my face . " " If I was sitting on your face no one will ever know it was you . " She shrugs , gets up , grabs the coconut . " And then we 'll all be saved -- la la la la . " " That 's not when the picture was taken , baby . " I follow her into the bathroom , where she punches four holes in the coconut with the screwdriver and then leans over the Vivienne Tam-designed sink and pours the milk from the shell over her head . " I know , I agree . " She tosses the husk into a wastebasket and massages the milk into her scalp . " Damien finds out and you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll be paying for your own abortions , so spare me . " I raise my arms helplessly . " Why do I always have to remind you that we should n't be seeing each other ? If this photo gets printed it 'll be time for us to wake up . " " If this picture gets printed we 'll just say it was a weak moment . " She whips her head back and wraps her hair in a towel . " Does n't that sound good . " Jesus , baby , you 've got people out there watching your apartment . " " I know . " She beams into the mirror . " Is n't it cute ? " " Why do I always need to remind you that I 'm basically still with , y'know , Chloe and you 're still with Damien ? " She turns away from the mirror and leans against the sink . " If you dump me , baby , you 'll be in a lot more trouble . " She heads toward the closet . " Why is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you mean , Alison ? " " Oh , let 's just say rumor has it that you 're looking at a new space . " She pauses , holds up a pair of shoes . " And we both know that if Damien knew that you were even contemplating your own pathetic club-slash-eatery while you 're currently being paid to run Damien 's own pathetic club-slash-eatery , therefore insulting Damien 's warped sense of loyalty , the term you 're fucked ' comes vaguely to mind . " She drops the shoes , leaves the closet . " I 'm not , " I insist , following her . " I swear I 'm not . Oh my god , who told you that ? " " Are you denying it ? " " N-no . I mean , I am denying it . I mean ... " I stand there . " Oh never mind . " Alison drops the robe and puts on some panties . " Three o'clock tomorrow ? " " I 'm swamped tomorrow , baby , so spare me , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at a new space ? " " Okay -- three o'clock on Monday . " " Why three o'clock ? Why Monday ? " " Damien 's having his unit cleaned . " She tosses on a blouse . " His unit ? " " His " she whispers --  " extensions . " " Damien has -- extensions ? " I ask . " He 's the grossest guy , baby . He is so evil . " She strides over to the armoire , sifts through a giant box of earrings . " Oh baby , I saw Tina Brown at 44 today at lunch and she 's coming tomorrow sans Harry and so is Nick Scotti , who -- I know , I know -- is a has-been but just looks great . " I move slowly back toward the frost-covered window , peer past the venetian blinds at the Jeep on Park . " I talked to Winona too . She is coming . Wait . " Alison pushes two earrings into one ear , three into another , and is now pulling them out . " Is Johnny coming ? " " What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Depp , " she shouts , throwing a shoe at me . " I guess , " I say vaguely . " Yeah . " " Goody , " I hear her say . " Rumor has it that Davey 's very friendly with heroin -- ooh , do n't let Chloe get too close to Davey -- and I also hear that Winona might go back to Johnny if Kate Moss disappears into thin air or a smallish tornado hurls her back to Auschwitz , which we 're all hoping for . " She notices the half-smoked cigarette floating in the Snapple bottle , then turns around , holding the bottle out to me accusingly , mentioning something about how Mrs. Chow loves kiwi-flavored Snapple . I 'm slouching in a giant Vivienne Tam armchair . " God , Victor , " Alison says , hushed . " In this light " she stops , genuinely moved --  " you look gorgeous . " Gaining the strength to squint at her , I say , finally , " The better you look , the more you see . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
