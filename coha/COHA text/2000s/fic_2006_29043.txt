one ORuddys thrived on Friday nights , under the stewardship of Casey Fielder . As the general manager he exercised absolute power here , and he had to wield his power with composure and resolve , or his staff would be lost in the chaos , in the kinetic heat of bodies and track lighting and frying food , in the clamor of conversation and complaint . On this particular Friday , as he watched and controlled the frenzy of the late dinner rush , it seemed to him that ORuddys was thriving as usual , and he approved . Casey was not above sweating alongside his staff , and throughout the dinner shift he bused as many tables , by his careful reckoning , as Paulo did . Once or twice he threw together some house salads to help out the harried sous-chef , and he ran meals to tables when the servers asked . But mostly his job was to supervise : to judge , to correct , to encourage , and sometimes to condemn . He watched even as he wiped down tables and mopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restocked the service stand , and tonight he was satisfied with the performance of his employees . The servers  --  all women , all sporting ponytails and pastel polo shirts , nametags bobbing on their breasts  --  wove gracefully through the maze of the dining floor , around the sluggish busboy . Casey approved of their pacing and their flirtations , of the way their singular pursuit of tips merged so neatly with the interests of the restaurant . When he crossed the threshold of the kitchen , that fluorescent , intense world , the usual racket struck him : a symphony of clattering plates , spurting water , the sizzling grill , the machine- gun Spanish of the cooks and dishwashers and the Latino radio station they listened to . In the kitchen , the workers moved with the frenetic purpose of ER doctors ; sweat shook off the jerky limbs of the head cook like water off a Labrador . They were entirely unmoved by Caseys presence when he came to check on them , adjusting their behavior to his watchfulness not one bit . One of the prep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he did not apologize when Casey scolded him . But Casey granted the kitchen staff some leeway on Friday nights because of their stoic competence , and tonight they were meeting the challenges of the rush . Casey was meeting the challenges as well , and most important , he exuded a sense of assurance and command . He had somehow kept his clothes pressed and his cowlick mastered , and the sweat stains did not show on his navy blue shirt , although he felt more disheveled than he looked . His feet hurt at the sides , and the grease-and-sweat stink of his undershirt had begun to overcome the Gold Bond powder hed puffed into his armpits at the beginning of the shift . But no one at ORuddys would ever suspect that the cares of management had worn him down tonight . He mitigated his tiredness with brisk , purposeful movement . He listened to the whining of his staff  --  When can we switch to the unwrapped straws ? Why does Julio put so much goddamn sour cream on everything ?  --  and he corrected their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had been ordered twice , a clogged toilet , an absent dishwasher . All the problems were laid at his feet , abandoned there , as if he could turn a magic wand on them and  --  poof . There was something in Casey that loved this , or rather something that needed it in an elemental way , the way a plant needs sunlight . Something in him turned crisis into sustenance , made the restaurant  --  especially on Friday nights  --  a place where he felt more at home than anywhere else . Sometimes he did feel possessed of secrets and special powers , although it was really nothing more than experience , a personality suited for this kind of work , and the guidance of the managers handbook , which he consulted several times a day . Within these walls ( where he could be found , on average , seventy- five hours a week ) , virtually every aspect of Caseys behavior had a foundation in the handbook . The expression on his face , for instance , was specifically calibrated according to the directive on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the managers expression should be that of a dinner party host who is pleased to see all of his/her friends enjoying themselves . Mindful of this advice , Casey held his eyes open wide against the scowl that often swelled inside . This gave him a look of perpetual expectation , as if he were always waiting for something to pounce on him . His fidelity to the dress code was absolute , so much so that he found himself wearing his managers uniform more or less continuously , regardless of the occasion . Page 32 : The managers pants should be black and neatly pressed ; the shirt and tie must be stately and of solid colors . After eight years at ORuddys , most of his wardrobe conformed to the dress code . Several months earlier , at the funeral for his Uncle Rich , he had looked down to find that he was not only wearing the requisite managers outfit but had pinned his managers nametag to the appropriate part of his shirt ( on the left breast , one inch above the top of the pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Most of the handbooks admonitions had seeped their way into his habits during his tenure at ORuddys . He had mastered the nuances and complexities of the place , and he considered Friday nights to be the reward for this mastery . On these nights he belonged among the happy , satiated crowd and the tip-giddy servers , because of the fact that he made it all happen , he provided for their comfort and fixed their problems . That they took him for granted was no matter , because he knew that without him it would all go away . It had been his idea to focus their attention on Fridays , for example , by creating Friday prime rib specials and putting coupons in Thursdays Beacon . Though he never spoke of the strategy in a selfcongratulatory way , he had come to see it as a marketing plan that was singularly appropriate for this particular township and restaurant . On Saturdays anyone seeking diversion drove the half hour to Scranton , where there was a cineplex and a mall . On Sundays the restaurants of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-sandwich specials and 6 percent tips . The location of the ORuddys , south of Arthur Avenue on the cusp of East Breeds , was inconvenient for the white-collar workers who might have come in for business lunches or after-dinner drinks , and so the weekday receipts largely depended on East Breeds locals : the ironworkers , the unemployed . These people were suspicious of the restaurant  --  the forced festivity of its decor , the cost of its fried cheese appetizers  --  and usually favored the Dairy Bar , unless it was someones birthday . There were lunch shifts , especially in the winter , when the cooks at ORuddys did nt need to filter the oil in the fryer . But all kinds of people came on Fridays , sometimes in droves , rambunctious from the cessation of work . Birthday celebrants , anxious first-daters , softball teams , lonely drunks eating fried jalapeos at the bar . The bartenders invented flamboyantly colored cocktails for the Friday drinkers , and Casey scheduled only his experienced servers for the dinner shift . On Friday afternoons the cooks would lay great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thaw . The souschef would jam the chiller with as many premade house salads as he could fit . The Friday servers showed up early for side work , and the small platoon of pert young women would gossip and smoke as they each rolled fifty sets of silverware . By seven oclock the hostess would be cautioning new arrivals of a forty-minute wait , and typically they waited . There werent many restaurants of its kind in Breeds Township , and no one wanted to drive to Scranton on Friday night . On these evenings ORuddys was expected to total receipts of eight thousand dollars , in the course of serving around three hundred customers , including bar patrons . The restaurant was expected to accomplish this with a staff of six in the kitchen and six on the floor , plus the supervising manager . This , at least , was the benchmark set in previous years , and which had been surpassed every weekend this past fall , a season of bliss . The Breeds Township High football team had gone eight and one , and after each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby stadium to discuss what they had seen over Busch Lights and buffalo wings . The autumn weather had been mild and breezy , so people avoided the stuffy , windowless bars near the township center . ORuddys had often reached the maximum capacity ( 112 persons , according to a brass plate in the entryway ) and in Caseys memory that fiscal season was defined by a conviviality that he had not felt before , that gave him hope . The restaurant had churned out the happy atmosphere of fried food and celebration and alcohol and flirtation , and in the midst of this jovial mass Casey had acknowledged  --  with his own kind of joy  --  the real matter , the true success : the Breeds Township ORuddys was flourishing under his command . But it was January now , and things had changed , in spite of the sense of chaos and gluttony that surrounded him on this night , in spite of the frantic motion and the kitchen noise . Casey finally admitted to himself that the hectic activity of the restaurant belied another slow night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that had really lasted for only an hour or so , had been the result of a dearth of workers . In a time of hardship , which January was proving to be , Casey would schedule no more staff than was needed . This meant that there had been only four waitresses all night , and one busboy , and by eight oclock the fifteen-minute wait ( even as a half-dozen open tables , littered with used dishes , mocked the hostess ) sent the later arrivals scattering to the Dairy Bar . The wait quickly shrank to ten minutes , then five , but by then it was too late , and at eight forty-five the hostess found herself facing a vacant foyer , chewing her thumbnail and waiting to be sent home . By ten Casey was sweatier and achier than hed been during the busiest autumn Fridays , yet he knew it was because he had tried to summon that past glory through haste and micromanagement , and because hed had to bus tables himself during the brief rush . The slump , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exodus of the experienced girls , and those who remained were either too hard up or too lazy to find work elsewhere . At ten-thirty Casey sent all but one of the waitresses to the break room to total up their receipts and roll more silverware . He told the bartender , who had nt made a drink in forty-five minutes , to clean up and leave ; if someone came in later , Casey would handle the bar . He retreated to his office , a square dark room next to the dry goods storage closet . Because of the stifling fires of the kitchen , they kept this back half of the restaurant minimally heated , and it was so cold in his office he put on his puffy brown coat and a scarf before he went in . He printed out the preliminary returns from the computer and extrapolated the numbers to estimate how they would do , although he wouldnt know for sure until all the girls turned in their cash . He rounded up some of the numbers , and he gave generous estimations for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push the final number into something short of extreme disappointment . It did nt help ; they would be at least three thousand below average again , for the fifth Friday in a row . It was not Caseys restaurant , not his investment that rode on these numbers . In fact the numbers would spell absolute disaster for no one . The octogenarian franchise owners , Mr. and Mrs. Ambrose Howard , were not going to allow themselves to fail this late in the game . There were indications ( a house in Weston , Mrs. Howards stockpile of minks , a new Skylark every other year ) that the Howards financial reserves were deep and diverse , though they were stingy enough when it came to running ORuddys . Casey wasnt sure why they bothered with the place , unless it simply gave them something to do , and another way to prove their fiscal mettle . The Friday numbers were a disappointment , it was true , but they were only that  --  not a disaster , not a death sentence . There was no comfort in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for there would still be blame , and this , like so much else at ORuddys , would be laid at Caseys feet . Although there were many factors beyond his control to consider , the low numbers were a reflection on him in some way , or at least he knew they would be perceived as such . The blame is assigned to the general manager after five failing Fridays in a row , just as it is given to the coach when a team hits a losing streak , the president when the economy slumps . He knew he should be proactive in his defense . He put aside the papers and began writing a memo on the computer . He addressed it to the Howards but sent a closed copy to the ORuddys headquarters in Dallas . He restrained his language to avoid sounding accusatory of the headquarters , though in truth he directed much of his personal blame toward them . For one thing  --  and this is what he led the memo with  --  substantial losses could be explained by the ORuddys is on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had thrust this new promotion upon the franchise by shipping them a crate full of cheap fifteen-minute hourglasses and a video explaining the idea : once an order was taken , the server would turn over the hourglass , and if the food wasnt on the table by the time the sand ran out , the meal was complimentary . Caseys staff had proven themselves to be categorically unprepared for this challenge . The end of the ORuddys is on the clock ! campaign , Casey wrote to close the first paragraph , is eagerly anticipated by the servers , cooks , and , I must confess , myself . He outlined other reasons , other justifications . The next one was the weather , which Casey admitted could not be blamed on the meddlers in Dallas . A vicious storm of freezing rain had struck in December , just before the deep freeze that came with Christmas , sheathing the township in ice for eight days . They were now more than two weeks into January , and each day of the new year had begun in the single digits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were no snowmen , because even the children refused to stay outside long enough to make them . Headquarters and the Howards would have to adjust and be more understanding . He did not say it in these words , and in fact he euphemized the problem so much he wondered if they could even understand his desperation . He could not say what he wanted to say  --  that the weather was starving them of their guests . He did nt want to mention the fight in the memo . Headquarters knew about it , and it would likely be the first thing they thought of when they saw the return address ( they controlled forty-two ORuddys franchises across the U.S. , and probably remembered only the ones that had caused trouble ) . But still he could not write about it , even cursorily . Besides , he did nt really know if the fight had hurt business . It had been covered by the Breeds Township Beacon , much to the distress of the Howards , and for days afterward customers had asked him about it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return and start beating on them during the Sunday buffet . But any press is good press , he had reminded the Howards . The media had made it clear that no one had been hurt or arrested , in spite of the fact that the fight had involved at least a dozen agitated teenagers . Casey did nt really think it would scare anyone away , and the coverage might remind people that the restaurant was there . He hoped very much that all of this was true . And so he ended the letter with as obsequious a tone as he could muster after the end of a wearying shift , and folded it into an envelope . Then he heard Jenny , the remaining on-duty server , knock . He knew it was Jenny because she wore a large assembly of finger rings , and when she knocked it sounded like someone nailing something to the door . She stuck her head in before he responded , the way they all did when they bothered him in his office . It infuriated him , not because he needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing this , his employees were trying to catch him in the act of something illicit , and he did not know what they thought they would see . Did they hope to catch him skimming cash from the bank bags ? Watering down the booze bottles ? Masturbating ? But Jenny may have used the knock-and-enter technique as a simple extension of her personality . There was a kind of endearing impertinence to her . In some ways she showed deference to his role as her boss  --  refusing to use his first name , for example  --  yet she often used curse words when speaking to him , and he could never get her to stop chewing gum during shifts ; she was never abashed when he lectured her about this touchstone of the server policy . She was young , the only server still in high school , and Casey liked her for the guilelessness that came with her youth . She had once told him , during her training , that she wasnt ready to be tested on the menu because she had nt studied it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though at the time he had sat her at table six and made her read the menu until she knew the thing by heart . Casey understood that honesty was hardly a common trait among teenagers , but in Jennys case it seemed a function of her youth , something that would certainly dissipate as she grew older . Jenny was also carelessly good-looking , with an eccentric sense of fashion that competed with her beauty . In addition to the mass of finger rings , she wore a huge assortment of hair clips and headbands , and her eyes were heavily shadowed . She often dyed her hair to match her polo shirt , and her earrings were conspicuous and dangling . But she was organically pretty , one of those girls who would have been more attractive naked and without makeup than at any other time , although Casey refrained from picturing her thus . Mr. Fielder , she said , still represented only by her head , encased in a mass of brunette hair streaked with bolts of scarlet . She was peeking through a small opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an intrusion . You got to get out here , now . Panic , mitigated by her delicate voice but obvious nonetheless . He clenched his muscles , sitting up straight and biting his teeth together . Whats going on ? he asked with a casual lilt , hoping for a mundane emergency . Jenny was the only server on the floor now , it being nearly eleven . Maybe there was a late rush after the Township High basketball game , or perhaps she had misentered a total for a credit card and the customer had turned hostile . She was a good server , personable and reliable , but she had her limits . It would be something of this nature , Casey told himself . Theyre back , Jenny said . Those boys are back again .
