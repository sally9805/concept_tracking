The ditch cleaved frogtown into two realms , and two powerful spirits heldsway , one on each side . One was old , old as the Cross , and the other had aged only a few days in a gallon can . Both had the power to change men ? s lives . On one side of the ditch , a packed-in , pleading faithful fell hard to their knees and called the Holy Ghost into their jerking bodies in unknown tongues . On the other side , two boys , too much alike to be anything but brothers , flung open the doors of a black Chevrolet and lurched into the yard of 117 D Street , hallelujahs falling dead around them in the weeds . In the house , a sad-eyed little woman looked out , afraid it might be the law . When your boys are gone you ? re always afraid it might be the law . But it was just her two oldest sons , Roy and Troy , floating home inside the bubble of her prayer , still in crumpled , cattin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk on Sunday morning . They were fine boys , though , beautiful boys . They were just steps away now , a few steps . She would fry eggs by the platterful and pour black coffee , and be glad they were not in a smoking hulk wrapped around a tree , or at the mercy of the police . She thought sometimes of walking over to the church to see it all , to hear the lovely music , but that would leave her boys and man unsupervised for too long . Her third son was eleven or so then . He could hear the piano ring across the ditch , even hear people shout , but he could smell the liquor that was always in the house on a Sunday and even steal a taste of it when no one was looking , so it was more real . // The holy ghost moved invisible , but they could feel it in the rafters , sense it racing inside the walls . It was as real as a jag of lightning , or an electrical fire . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show that he did not believe he was better than them . " Do you believe in the Holy // Ghost ? " he asked , and they said they did . He preached then of the end of the world , and it was beautiful . // They were still a new denomination then , but had spread rapidly in the last fifty years around a nation of exploited factory workers , coal // miners , and rural and inner-city poor . Here , it was a church of lintheads , pulpwooders and sharecroppers , shoutin ? people , who said // amen like they were throwing a mule shoe . Biblical scholars turned their noses up , calling it hysteria , theatrics , a faith of the illiterate . But in a place where machines ate people alive , faith had to pour even hotter than blood . // It had no steeple , no stained glass , no bell tower , but it was the house of Abraham and Isaac , of Moses and Joshua , of the Lord thy // God . People tithed in Mercury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who wore ancient black suit coats over overalls , // and young men in short-sleeved dress shirts and clip-on ties . Women sat plain , not one smear of lipstick or daub of makeup on their // faces , and not one scrap of lace at their wrists or necks . Their hair was long , because Paul wrote that " if a woman have long hair , it is a glory to her , for her hair is given her for a covering . " Their hair and long dresses were always getting caught in the machines , but it was in the Scripture , so they obeyed . Some wore it pinned up for church , because of the heat , but before it was over hairpins would litter the // floor . // They listened as the preacher laid down a list of sins so complete it left a person no place to go but down . // " They preached it hard , so hard a feller couldn ? t live it , " said Homer Barnwell , who went there as a boy . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignored the weakness in their wind and pain in their chests and sang " I ? ll Fly Away " // and " Kneel at the Cross " and " That Good Ol ? Gospel Ship . " A woman named Cora Lee Garmon , famous for her range , used to hit // the high notes so hard " the leaders would stand out in her neck , " Homer said . // Then , with the unstoppable momentum of a train going down a grade , the service picked up speed . The Reverend evoked a harsh // God , who turned Lot ? s wife into a pillar of salt , and condemned the Children of Israel , who gave their golden earrings to Aaron to fashion Baal , the false god . " I have seen this people , " God told Moses , " and behold , it is a stiff-necked people . Now therefore let me alone , so that my wrath may wax hot against them . " // As children looked with misery on a service without end , the preacher read chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the day of Pentecost was fully come , they were all with // one accord in one place . And suddenly there came a sound from // heaven as of a rushing mighty wind , and it filled all the house // where they were sitting . And there appeared unto them cloven // tongues like as of fire , and it sat upon each of them . And they were // all filled with the Holy Ghost , and began to speak with other // tongues . . . // The congregants ? eyes were shut tight . // " Do you feel the Spirit ? " the Reverend shouted . // Their hands reached high . // " Can you feel the Holy Ghost ? " // They answered one by one , in the light of the full Gospel . // " Yeeeeesssss. " // Then , as if they had reached for a sizzling clothesline in the middle of an electrical storm , one by one they began to jerk , convulsing in the grip of unseen power . Others threw their arms open wide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Some just stood and shivered . // Some danced , spinning . // Some leapt high in the air . // Some wept . // Some shrieked . // Some of the women shook their heads so violently that their hair came free and whipped through the air , three feet long . Hairpins flew . // The Ghost was in them now . // They began to speak in tongues . // The older church people interpreted , and the congregation leaned in , to hear the miracle . It sounded like ancient Hebrew , maybe , a little , // and other times it sounded like nothing they had heard or imagined . They rushed to the front of the church and knelt in a line , facing the // altar , so the preacher could lay his hands on them , and-through the Father , in the presence of the Holy Ghost-make them whole . // One by one , they were slain in the Spirit , and fell backward , some of them , fainting on the floor . The services could last for hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? s goin ? good , " Homer said , " why switch it off ? " // As strong as it was , as close , it was as if sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal , across that ditch . // " We could have by God stayed longer if you ? d have brought some damn money , " griped Roy , as they meandered toward the house . It is unclear where they had been that weekend , but apparently they had a real good time . Roy , the prettiest of all of them , leaned against the car for balance , and cussed his older brother a little more.Roy ? s eyes were just like my father ? s , a bright blue , and his hair was black . He was tall for a Bragg , and the meanest when he drank . He was not a dandy and just threw on his clothes , but was one of those men who would have looked elegant standing in a mudhole. // Troy cussed him back , but cheerfully . He always wore snow-white T-shirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he blithely dog-cussed his brother he bent over , took off one loafer and dumped several neatly folded bills into his hand . Then , hopping around on one foot , he waved the bills in his brother ? s face . // " You lying son of a bitch , " Roy said . // Troy , his shoe still in his hand , just hopped and grinned , trying not to get his white sock dirty . // He sniffed the money , like it was flowers . // " I ? ll kill you , " Roy said . // But they were always threatening to kill somebody . // Troy , in a wobbly pirouette , laughed out loud . // In seconds , they were in the dirt , tearing at clothes and screaming curses , and rolled clear into the middle of D Street , in a whirl of blood // and cinders. // The commotion drew first Velma and then Bobby from inside the house.Velma , unheard and ignored , pleaded for them to stop . Bobby , // on a binge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and did a do-si-do. // My father banged through the door and into the yard , and , like a pair of long underwear sucked off a clothesline by a tornado , was carried away by the melee . // In the rising dust , they clubbed each other about the head with their fists , split lips and blacked eyes and bruised ribs . My father , smaller than his brothers , was knocked down and almost out . Velma bent over my father , to make sure he was breathing , and yelled at the // older two : " I ? ll call the law . " Then she left walking , to find a telephone . // How many times did Velma make that walk to a borrowed telephone , having to choose between her sons ? freedom and their safety ? // My Aunt Juanita , driving through the village , remembers seeing her walking fast down the street . " Her heels was just a ? clickin ? on the // road , " she said . // She stopped and , through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " The boys is killing each other , " she said . // In the yard , the boys were staggering now , about used-up . The neighbors watched from their porches , but no one got in the way . The // distant scream of a police siren drifted into the yard.Velma had found a telephone . // By the time the police came , the street was empty and quiet in front of 117 , the brothers inside , ruining Velma ? s washrags with their blood . Bobby had enjoyed himself immensely , and gone a half day without pants of any kind . Velma walked back , her flat shoes clicking slowly now . But her boys were safe , and nothing mattered next to that . // In the aftermath , she cooked a five-pound block of meat loaf , a mountain of fried potatoes , a cauldron of pinto beans , and dishpans of squash and okra-nothing special , just the usual supper for the kin that , every Sunday , trickled in to eat . // It was nothing special , either , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The brothers regularly fought in the middle of D Street . " I // watched ? em fight , " said Charles Parker , who lived next door . // Or , as Carlos put it : " You didn ? t never ask about that big fight Roy and Troy had , you asked about which one . It happened regular . " It was just part of the rhythm of the week , the rhythm of their lives . // Most lives move to one kind or another . On the coast , they move to tides , and in a factory town they move to an assembly line . For Carlos , a body and fender man and wrecker driver , life moved to the rhythms of the highway , to the voice of the dispatcher on the radio . In the week he cruised slow and easy , but on Friday nights , when drinkers hit the roads , the dispatcher ? s voice crackled with possibility . He stomped the accelerator and raced from ditch to ditch , his winch cable whining , yellow lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it was a bad one , not screaming at all . // For his cousins on D Street , it was the bootlegger ? s rhythm . " The boys and Uncle Bobby all worked , and only dranked on weekends . They ? d get goin ? real good on Friday and still be goin ? on a Sunday . Of course , sometimes they could still be going on a Tuesday , depending on how much liquor they had . They were the best people in the world , gentle people , when they were all right . But all your daddy ? s life , on a weekend , there was liquor there in that house . " // In the calm of a Monday , the nights had a warmth and peace in Velma ? s house . After work , her extended family gathered in her // kitchen , eating , talking , babies riding on their knees . But mostly , in that quiet , she cooked . " Oh my , " said Carlos , " did she cook . " She // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanksgiving or Christmas Day , and Carlos loved to go see his Aunt Velma in // the calm . " It didn ? t matter what time of night or day it was , or even if she had to get out of bed , when you went to Aunt Velma ? s house // the first thing she did was ask you , ? Y ? all boys had something to eat ? ? It didn ? t matter if you ? d done eat , ? cause Velma was gon na feed you anyway . " // The iron stove had a cast-iron warmer on the top , and in that warmer would be pork roasts and pork chops and fried chicken , twogallon // pots of butter beans with salt pork , navy beans with ham bone , rattlesnake beans glistening with bacon fat , pans of chicken and dressing , macaroni and cheese , cornbread and cathead biscuits , mounds of mashed potatoes and sweet potatoes , skillets of fried green tomatoes . // She made meat loaf in a washtub , working loaf bread into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be fried pies , apple // and peach , in the warmer , and a banana puddin' ? in the icebox . She cooked her pies in a pan the size of a Western Flyer , and she did not // cut you a piece but scooped out a mound , a solid pound of pie . // It was not just food . There was a richness in it , of cream and butter and bacon fat . Her dishes were chipped and her forks were worn , pitted steel , but when people were done the utensils looked like they had been licked clean , and sometimes they were . She taught generations of women to cook , including my own mother , who thinks of her with every shaker of salt . Generations of men , like Carlos , get teary-eyed when they think of her supper table on a random Monday , because they know it will never be that good again . // In the calm of a Tuesday , the mercurial Roy lay on the couch in the living room with a baby asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was drinking , fight laughing , bleeding , but sober he was a gentle man . " Whose baby are you ? " he always asked , as the infants opened their eyes . " Roy rocked the babies in the rocking chairs , when he was all right , " my mother said . " He would sing , and hum to them , and he would even diaper them-I guarantee you that your daddy never got nowhere near a diaper . " Roy was not married then , and had no children of his own . He just loved babies , and would rock Troy ? s children and sing , and hum the part where the bough breaks , and the baby falls . // He was a mechanic , a good one , with a set of paid-for tools . Women chased him . He had everything to live for , on a Tuesday , and no reason to dull his life with liquor , no reason to hide in a whiskey haze . // In the quiet of a Wednesday , Troy walked home from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In that time and place , it was as noble a job as // being a horse breeder . He opened the coop and stuck his hand in toward the fierce creature inside , eyes yellow , beak sharp as a cat ? s // claw , trilling a warning so low it was almost a growl . But it did not draw blood as he reached in and lifted it out . // He would sit on the porch , a cup of Red Diamond coffee on the rail , and stroke its beak , cooing to it , as if he wanted it to understand the // awful sacrifice he was asking it to make . He had one bird that had won seven fights , a remarkable feat in a death sport , and he would run his fingers through its feathers , looking for parasites . He would treat it with Mercurochrome , like a child with a skinned knee , and let it peck corn from his palm . He fed them a mix of vitamins and racing pigeon feed , to make them strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to stanch the bleeding when they were cut . //
