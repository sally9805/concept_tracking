Her debut album , " Come Away With Me , " defied industry trends with its subtlety and jazzy-folksy feel , and in February her independent approach paid huge dividends : She and the album won eight Grammy Awards , including album of the year and best new artist . The 24-year-old musician and daughter of famed sitar player Ravi Shankar sang , played piano and composed many of the songs on the album , including the title track . Molly Ivins Syndicated columnist and author , Texas Molly Ivins knows George W. Bush : She 's covered him since he was governor and known him since high school .

When the U.S. Secret Service attempted to obtain the reading records of a Santa Monica Public Library patron without a warrant , head librarian Allard turned them away . The 65-year-old woman refused to give up the information until they returned with proper documentation . She remains alarmed by the government 's access to reading records of her patrons as a result of the USA PATRIOT act .

Chavez Cano , now 70 , began a campaign that received international attention , forcing local police to seriously investigate the crimes . In 1999 she founded Casa Amiga , the first rape crisis center on the Mexican border and still the only one in her city .

Louise Bourgeois Artist , New York Since the 1930s , Bourgeois has been creating provocative and elegant drawings , paintings and sculptural pieces that defy simple classification . Rediscovered in the 1970s and ' 80s , she remains one of the greatest living artists . At age 92 she continues to produce sculptures that show mastery of many materials , including bronze , plaster , glass , latex , steel and cloth .

All four are involved in the international effort to develop microbicides : topical treatments that prevent HIV from attaching to vaginal cells . Women are four times more vulnerable to HIV than men are , and in countries where they lack the social and economic power to demand their partners use condoms , women face even greater risks . The advancement of microbicide research , however , could put the power to prevent HIV back in women 's hands .

The veil seems unwieldy , yet , as the Iranian-born Ghazel explains , it is a " reality of life in Iran . " Her videos intrigue and entertain Western audiences , but they are so controversial in Iran that many have been banned . Dividing her time between her home country and France , the 37-year-old artist considers herself an outsider in both countries . Perhaps it is this distance that allows her to examine the lives of Iranian women , whose personal freedoms are sharply limited , with a blend of criticism , humor and sharp commentary .
