As recession drives more Japanese to despair , a suicide mecca 's self-appointed guardian steps up his watch . Keeping the desperate from going over the edge . They come on sunny days , when the sky is bright and clear above the Tojinbo cliffs along the coast of the Sea of Japan . Yukio Shige says they do n't look at the view . " They do n't carry a camera or souvenir gifts , " he says . " They do n't have anything . They hang their heads and stare at the ground . " For five years , Shige , 65 , has approached such people at the cliffs ' edge with a simple " Hello " and a smile . He might ask how they came there and at what inn they were staying . Sometimes after a light touch to the shoulder , Shige says , they burst into tears , and he begins to console them . " You 've had a hard time up until now , " he says , " have n't you ? " The basalt cliffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast of Japan , are a well-known site for suicide in a country with one of the highest suicide rates in the world ; at 23.8 per 100,000 , Japan 's rate is significantly higher than that of the U.S. , for example , where the rate is 11 per 100,000 . One in 5 Japanese men and women has seriously considered taking his or her life , according to a recent government survey ; each year over the past decade , more than 30,000 people have killed themselves . And as the economic downturn has pushed rates of unemployment and bankruptcy higher , the number of suicides has risen . From January through April , 11,236 people killed themselves , up 4.5% from the same period in 2008 " I think there will be many more suicides this year , " says Shige . The retired detective from nearby Fukui City has patrolled the cliffs two or three times a day since 2004 , wearing white gloves and a floppy sun hat , carrying binoculars to focus on three spots on the cliffs where suicides are most common . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and says he has helped prevent 188 potential suicides . After he 's talked them off the cliffs , Shige -- a trained counselor -- takes them to his small office , where two gas heaters keep a kettle boiling , ready to make the tea that accompanies his counseling sessions . For men , Shige says , the biggest problems are debt and unemployment ; most of the women are there because of depression or health issues . " If it 's a case of sexual harassment , I 'll go with her to the office and confront her boss , " says Shige . " If a child has issues with his father , I tell the parent that he is driving his child to suicide and get them to write a promise to change . They hang it on the wall . " There 's no rush in Shige 's office . He offers those who go there oroshi-mochi , a dish of pounded sticky rice served with grated radish . Traditionally the food is prepared to celebrate the New Year , with each family taking its own rice to be mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and eat mochi , they remember their childhood -- father , mother , siblings , hometown . They remember they 're not alone , " Shige says . So far , Shige has funded his operation , including office rent of $800 a month and occasional support for those trying to get back on their feet , with his retirement savings and donations . But in April , the Japanese government committed to supporting Shige 's and similar efforts with about 10 billion yen ( $100 million ) over the next three years . " It 's taken five years to get the support , " says Shige . " But we also need the kind of policies that keep people from becoming depressed in the first place "  - -  particularly by bolstering the safety net for people with mental disorders and those who have hit hard times . In April , on the fifth anniversary of starting his operation , Shige sat reading a three-page , handwritten letter he had received that day from a Shizuoka man , one of many he gets from those he has helped . The letter concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the love that surrounded him . As Shige finished reading , the melody of " Amazing Grace " rose from his cell phone . " I want Tojinbo to be the most challenging place , " he says . " Not where life ends , but where it begins .
