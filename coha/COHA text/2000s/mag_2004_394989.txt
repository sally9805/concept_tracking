ANDREA JUNG : She moved a tired brand upmarket and created a global powerhouse . Now Jung 's name is cropping up on shortlists for bigger jobs . Who 'll be knocking on her door next ? <p> Seated in her Manhattan corner office , Andrea Jung is talking up cosmetics like a seasoned Avon lady . She holds up a tube of shimmering burgundy lip gloss called Glow Baby Glow . " This , " the chief executive declares , " has been heralded as one of the breakthrough ideas of the decade . " The quantum leap ? The packaging . Avon 's new line puts an applicator on each end  --  one for the tube of gloss , and the other for mascara or concealer , so you can carry two kinds of makeup in one tube . A bonus is the product 's name , which might make you blush without any rouge : Hook Up . <p> This is Avon calling ? Ten years ago the world 's largest direct seller of cosmetics was showing a lot of wrinkles ; many women thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curlers and Tupperware parties . But when Jung took over as CEO in 1999 , she gave the company an extreme makeover , pouring millions into research and development , pushing new lines of skin cream , expanding into overseas markets and developing snazzy ads with celebrities like Salma Hayek . Since then , sales have jumped 45 percent , from $5.3 billion to a projected $7.7 billion in 2004 ; the company 's stock has risen 164 percent . Avon looks years younger , too . College girls are now peddling Avon on campuses , from a new line called Mark that includes Hook Up for the 16- to 24-year-old crowd . " It 's very modern , " says Jung , 46 ( yes , she uses Hook Up ) . In the process , she 's given herself a career make-over , with her name cropping up on shortlists of candidates to turn around bigger companies . <p> Jung made a good first impression at Avon , helping steer the company away from a strategy that struck her as doomed to fail . In 1993 , Jim Preston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in department stores , and hired Jung as a consultant . The Princeton grad knew about high-end cosmetics from a stint as an executive vice president at Neiman Marcus in Dallas  --  a job she left when she married Bloomingdale 's CEO Michael Gould and moved to New York . ( The couple later divorced . ) But Jung took one look at Avon 's products and saw what many Avon executives had not  --  after all , Preston now concedes , the company was being run by " men in suits who do n't really understand this in the first place . " Avon 's colors needed freshening . The packaging looked cheap . <p> The skin cream was n't smooth enough . She told Preston that Avon could beat the department-store lines by staying out of department stores . She argued that high-end brands can scale down for the masses , but moving in the other direction is hard when you 're competing on a crowded store shelf . All Avon needed to do was upgrade its act  --  and stick with direct sales . ( Some 4.4 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Says Preston : " Andrea saw women had begun to realize paying 50 bucks for a skin cream did n't make a lot of sense if you could buy the same quality for $30 . " He hired Jung to oversee U.S. marketing in 1994 . <p> She acted quickly to move Avon upmarket  --  overhauling colors , textures and packaging ( she redesigned its lipstick cases , for instance , so they swiveled more firmly ) . Preston heaped more responsibility on his rising star , asking her to work on Avon 's global expansion . Jung had little business experience in foreign markets , but as the daughter of immigrants from Hong Kong and China ( she was born in Toronto ) , she had a feel for different cultures . Once again , she suggested the company change course . Avon had operated on the assumption that women around the world wanted different beauty products . But Jung believed all women had similar notions of beauty , and therefore would buy the same products  --  no need to customize so much for local markets . She rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into new countries ( it operates in about 140 of them now ) . She worked hard at the public-relations side of being a top executive , too . She once flew to Mexico to unveil a new line of products . Preston recalls that Avon 's executive team in Latin America expected her to bomb , that her Manhattan-glam look would make it hard for her to connect with the local sales staff . But Jung sprinkled a little Spanish into her talk and connected , says Preston , who heard glowing reports back from the team . " You see this beautiful woman in a Chanel suit and pearls , the epitome of what you expect to see in high-fashion beauty business , " says Preston . When Preston stepped down , Avon 's board went outside to find his replacement , overlooking Jung , and chose Duracell CEO Charles Perrin in 1997 . By all accounts , Perrin had trouble understanding the business , and Jung was tapped for the top job two years later . <p> Jung is the first woman CEO in Avon 's 118-year history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief executive would be fielding queries about strategy , marketing and financial . She was surprised by the other questions , however . " When I came into this role , I did n't expect that the microscope would be on how I raise my children , " says Jung , who has a son and daughter . She makes sure the job does n't overwhelm her family life . " There are things I miss of my children 's events  --  never the most important , though , " she says . Colleagues say she 's introduced a culture at Avon that lets parents take time off , guilt-free , to attend crucial school activities . She 's committed to helping raise money to find a cure for breast cancer , the disease that took her grandmother 's life ( Avon 's donated $350 million and mammogram equipment to countries like Brazil ) . Jung also flew in 100 top female Avon staffers from around the world for a " leadership forum . " Given Avon 's business , it 's not surprising that an overwhelming majority of the 45,900 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a company of Avon 's size with women in the two top slots : Susan Kropf is chief operating officer . Jung expects the ranks of women CEOs to grow . " The next five years are going to be very different , " she says . " There are so many women right now in strong No. 2 positions who are ready to take on the No. 1 job . " <p> These days , Jung 's No. 1 job is fixing some soft spots in Avon 's business  --  particularly in U.S. markets  --  that have led to stalled profits and a dip in its stock . Mark , the line Avon launched last year for younger women , is expected to bring in $45 million in revenue this year  --  but it 's still not a home run . Other new ventures include a men 's catalog with standards like shaving cream and cologne , and a line that debuts next year called Beauty on a Budget , with products below $10 . She also says a stronger economy close to home will help . Overseas markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation soon to allow direct sales again  --  they were banned in 1998 because of fraud  --  and open a huge opportunity for women to run their own businesses selling Avon . " Every time I go back there , I see how unbelievably exciting the opportunity is , " says Jung , who 's fluent in Mandarin . Avon expects its revenue in China to nearly triple to $600 million by 2007 . Russia is also expected to continue to grow for Avon . Says Andrew Shore , an analyst at Deutsche Bank : " The long-term prospects for this company are extremely bright . " <p> So , too , it appears , are the prospects for Jung . Earlier this year she was rumored to be on the shortlist for the CEO job at Coca-Cola . Jung wo n't confirm she was approached , but does n't deny it either . " It 's certainly a flattering comment on the company 's performance , " Jung says . But , she added , " I 'm extremely committed " to Avon . Jung has considered leaving Avon at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mid- ' 90s to be CEO of a major retail firm . " We sat down in the kitchen and we chatted , " he says . " She was really wrestling with a decision . " We know how that decision went , but if new job offers keep knocking , even Jung may start wondering : what will be the Avon lady 's next calling ? <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ROSY VIEW : Jung sees growth for Avon 's new lines <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : RED TAPE : Jung has pushed hard to open new foreign markets , including Beijing .

Yes , the ranks of women in business are still thin , particularly at the upper echelons . But determined , smart executives like these are changing the equation . Watch for them in 2005 .
