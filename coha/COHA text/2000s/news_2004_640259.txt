<p> Astronomers wax poetic and passionate in their protests . Seven shuttle astronauts know they could sacrifice their lives if their mission goes awry . <p> NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe 's decision to let the Hubble Space Telescope die prematurely has unleashed such a firestorm that , in efforts large and small , the space agency has found itself digging out of a public-relations fiasco that threatens taxpayer support for future missions to the moon and Mars . <p> ' It 's a travesty to lose this fantastic device , ' physics guru and best-selling author Brian Greene told a standing-room-only audience at the Tattered Cover bookstore in Cherry Creek in early April , continuing the debate . <p> No scientific mission ever carried out on the space shuttle or international space station , no individual telescope in an orchestra of sophisticated instruments around the globe , and no recent NASA mission has become as beloved as Hubble , its supporters say . <p> While ground-based telescopes work with precision powered by newer instruments , helping transform cosmology in most of the light spectrum , only Hubble - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ultraviolet . <p> Astronomers worry about a trio of developments : President Bush 's proposed 2005 budget shelves the Hubble servicing mission and delays a space mission that would have replaced Hubble 's capability in space . And the launch date for the next big space telescope , Hubble 's successor , has slipped from 2009 to 2011 . <p> ' Suppose we lose this battle to convince NASA , and Hubble fails in 2006 to 2007 . Now , you 're looking at a six-year gap , ' said Michael Shull , chairman of the University of Colorado 's department of astrophysical and planetary sciences . <p> Science , then , would have to wait . <p> ' Some of the most important science questions - such as the formation of structure in the universe , the origins of elements in the universe , dark energy in the universe - some of those questions will not be answered until these new capabilities are in orbit , ' said Jon Morse , an Arizona State University associate professor of astronomy . <p> Legions of fans have been so vocal that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hubble huggers . ' <p> Some say Hubble 's popularity stems from the aftermath of the 1986 Challenger crash , when space fans most needed to believe NASA could do something right . <p> ' I think the Hubble would have captured the hearts and the imaginations of children and adults a throughout the world no matter when it was launched , ' said John Bahcall , a Princeton University professor awarded NASA 's highest honor for his research with the Hubble Space Telescope . <p> ' It answers the most basic questions that human beings want to know the answers to : How big the universe is , how old it is , what makes it the way it is . What strange things - and awesome and beautiful things - are out there that we 've never imagined ? ' said Bahcall , chairman of a science committee that recommended servicing Hubble . <p> O'Keefe , for his part , said he was motivated primarily by safety concerns for shuttle astronauts . <p> In January , shortly after Bush unveiled a vision to guide the space agency to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission . Canceling the estimated $ 750 million mission imperils $ 250 million in batteries , gyroscopes and two pricey instruments built in Colorado . <p> Meanwhile , at CU , where a Hubble science team is unraveling and $ 20 million for data analysis has evaporated , academic leaders are lobbying O'Keefe to visit later this spring . <p> Already , public and private protests have been credited with prompting NASA 's reconsideration . After prodding by Congress , O'Keefe agreed that a National Academy of Sciences committee should weigh the scientific benefits of the mission versus the risk to shuttle astronauts . <p> ' They 're going to say , ' What are the challenges with the shuttle servicing mission and are there innovative , clever things we could do to reduce the risks ? " said Jim Crocker , vice president of civil space at Lockheed Martin Space Systems . <p> O'Keefe , heeding the advice of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board , wants to be able to inspect the space shuttle for damage on orbit - doable by astronauts at the space station . The National Academy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes could do the same . <p> Also , trying to be clever without creating a costly mission , there 's talk of hitching a vehicle next to Hubble to provide a battery boost , much like a routine AAA rescue mission for a stranded motorist . <p> Lockheed - which designed and built Hubble - penned a 200-page reply , among two dozen proposals to NASA that tap robots for a Hubble house call . <p> Even now , robots with Spider-man-like climbing skills and ' hands ' sophisticated enough to thread a needle are testing their dexterity on exact replicas of Hubble to prove - on the ground - that they can accomplish what will be demanded in orbit . <p> Robots are unlikely , however , to be trusted opening and closing Hubble 's sticky doors . <p> Changing out the wide-field planetary camera would be like pulling open a cabinet drawer . The door into which the new Cosmic Origins Spectrograph goes has n't been problematic . The gyroscopes that hold Hubble 's gaze steady , however , are behind a door that was difficult for astronauts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Astronauts - who have handled Hubble 's bulky cables , pulled aside insulation , opened doors , loosened bolts and yanked out batteries , then restored the order they disrupted - doubt that robots are up to the task . <p> Meanwhile , two scientific committees that weighed the risk to astronauts against the benefit to science have already issued strong ' yes ' votes for more Hubble science . <p> ' We agonized about this , ' said Craig J. Hogan , a member of one committee and author of ' The Little Book of the Big Bang . ' <p> ' The biggest scientific impact from the shuttle is the Hubble repair mission , ' he said . ' Those are heroic moments , ' added Hogan , vice provost for research at the University of Washington . ' They 're the things with the huge payoffs . ' <p> If the robots got it right , Hubble would sail deeper into middle age , with even more capability to produce jaw-dropping images . If they got it wrong , light would bleed in , much like leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin 's Crocker envisions astronauts and robots will both fly - robots first and astronauts when NASA has returned to a regular space shuttle flight schedule . <p> Meanwhile , NASA is mulling ideas for launching a replacement space telescope with skill comparable to Hubble 's within 15 years , possibly cannibalizing an instrument designed for Hubble . <p> But is Hubble worth all the worry ? <p> Absolutely , say its staunchest fans . <p> Orbiting 375 miles above Earth , Hubble pulls in light that 's partitioned among its array of instruments . <p> During those orbits , Hubble has clearly identified black holes at the center of all the galaxies at which it has taken a close look . Studying distant supernovae , Hubble confirmed the universe not only is expanding , but its expansion rate has been boosted by dark energy - a mysterious force that drives space apart . <p> The space telescope has pulled in faint light to explore back in time , puzzling out the formation of galaxies at the edge of the universe . <p> Conducting a more precise , systematic survey of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas than it uses up . <p> ' Does the formation of galaxies use up all the gas ? ' asked John Stocke , a CU astrophysicist . ' The answer is ' No , ' in a big way . There is more gas that never made it into galaxies . That 's been a lot of fun to find out . ' <p> CU scientists had hoped to learn even more through the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph , or COS , built by the University of Colorado and Ball Aerospace . It was supposed to be installed on Hubble and would have allowed the CU research group to continue posing far-reaching questions for Hubble to answer . The COS specializes in the ultraviolet band of the light spectrum that astronomers use as a diagnostic tool . <p> Some of the most energetic and enigmatic objects in space , like black holes and quasars , emit most of their light in the ultraviolet range , said CU 's Shull . <p> ' All of the fingerprints that the elements make on light allow us to figure out what the stuff is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , the lightest , simplest element and the most abundant gas since the beginning of the universe . <p> ' The strongest feature that it creates in the spectrum is in the ultraviolet , ' Stocke said . <p> Not launching the spectrograph on the Hubble also imperils the study of atmospheres of distant planets that orbit stars like our sun - analysis that would suggest whether some are capable of sustaining life . <p> That stalled science has researchers around the nation racing against a deadline later this month to create concepts for a new space telescope that could do as much - or more - than Hubble by cannibalizing instruments such as the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph . <p> ' In the absence of servicing Hubble , we would need to fly a new space telescope , ' Morse said . The former CU staffer is now an associate professor at Arizona State and is among the teams submitting proposals for the project , which has already been delayed . <p> ' The new space telescope could be equipped with more powerful cameras than Hubble and spectrographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' <p> By month 's end , the two dozen proposals will be done . NASA will select 10 for study . One year from now , it could add one to its to-do list . <p> ' The mission concept study is real , but that does n't guarantee a mission , ' Morse said . <p> Diedtra Henderson can be reached at **25;453;TOOLONG or 303-820-1910.
