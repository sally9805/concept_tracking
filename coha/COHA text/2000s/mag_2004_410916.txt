Tom Ford is leaving his two mistresses , Gucci and YSL Rive Gauche . But is he leaving fashion altogether ? Phoebe Eaton looks for clues in an interview she had with the designer less than two weeks before he quit // It was 8 P.M. when the switch was thrown on the lights that would paint the twin torsos at the gate of the Rodin Museum in Paris an exuberant , irreverent magenta . A champagne-carbonated party , ritual foreplay at every Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche fashion show , was getting underway , even if the host was nowhere to be seen . But he was all anyone talked about : What would become of Tom Ford , the impossibly young , impeccably groomed , conspicuously talented , shamelessly flirty , sexually outrageous , verbally courageous , always tan , always deliberately stubbled , always unbuttoned-down-to-there guy who had upended two major fashion houses ( first Gucci , then Yves Saint Laurent ) and then presumed-yes , presumed-to design for both labels at once ? Tom Ford , who had also helped lasso Stella McCartney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Boucheron for the $8-billion-plus Gucci Group , where he , the self-styled creative director , hoped to make them cash cows . But on the evening of the show on October 12 , the real drama was going on behind the scenes : Ford and the genial Gucci Group president and CEO , Domenico De Sole , were bickering over control of the company with **25;913;TOOLONG ( PPR ) , their deep-pocketed French backer . The fate of the two men who had hauled Gucci back from the brink now hung in the balance , as both camps spanked each other in the press . " If you feel that you ca n't go on , " went the pumped-up Gloria Gaynor anthem kicking off the spring pageant of low-slung genie pants , multibuckle trench coats , Charleston-ready evening dresses and wolf-whistle spectator heels . But with a faint echo of Samuel Beckett , the words also signaled an existential fatigue . There was talk of De Sole , 59 , retiring , and Ford , 42 , ascending to the position of CEO . There was talk of Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted he had no intention of doing , at least for the time being . Or there was the chance that Ford might find himself back in Santa Fe , where he grew up , raising fox terriers and horses , or so he joked when I caught up with him after the show , less than two weeks before a November 4 press release would be faxed everywhere with news that he and De Sole had reluctantly decided to pack it in . ( Ford will leave the company in April after presenting his fall collections for both brands . ) At the time of our interview , Ford said he was " cautiously optimistic " that he would be staying right where he was . It 's well-known that Ford hit a rough patch when he rode into Paris after Gucci Group acquired Yves Saint Laurent in 1999 . The French are a congenitally tough crowd ; when the designer grabbed the reins at YSL Rive Gauche a few months later , every location he 'd browsed for his first show suspiciously withdrew from contention . He soon found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to by some-with a Gallic shrug-as " the mausoleum . " " The French were a little bit rough on me in the beginning , " Ford conceded . " But I think they 've warmed up . " And had n't Bernadette Chirac , the wife of the president , fluttered by on the arm of PPR 's Francois Pinault to say hello at the show ? To be faithful or not to YSL 's abdicated creator has always been the question-for the houses hardy perennial fan base but also for Ford himself . " Tom added sex , it 's as simple as that , " Betty Catroux said , as she took her seat . There was a time when the platinum-blonde muse-a-go-go had been all about Yves , but now it was Tom 's zebra-pelted runway that danced across her mirrored shades . It was Yves Saint Laurent who 'd sent the first bare-breasted model down a runway in 1968 , but this time around at the Rodin , there was an unexpected show of skin when some straps broke and one girl 's frock flounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford , still distressed by the memory days later . " It was , like , suddenly some breasts were walking down the runway . And that was n't the point ! " The year before , of course , it was the point . Saint Laurent had shown several surrealist collections in his day , and " what he did deserves to be continued , " said Ford . He too would twirl Salvador Dali 's mustache , by painting some models ' nipples an amusing shade of purple . " Probably not one of my best ideas , " Ford admitted with a giggle . " But we are an animal that puts color on our eyelids . Is it any more strange to put it on our nipples ? " Tom Ford had always been more fluent in the Swahili of " volume lag , " " points of distribution " and the " discretionary spend " than his predecessor and many of his own peers . " YSL was the personal company of Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Berge , " he pointed out . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new licensing deal in another country and never saw the product . " Licenses run amok were ruining the brand , so Ford and De Sole snatched them back , as they had at Gucci , attempting to work the same magic . But the price of delivering to his shareholders was unyielding stress , and Ford was only getting three hours of sleep a night . In his dreams , he was always running his fingers through the hair he had as a kid-all " feathered and layered and Farrah . " Hair and its tendrils of Samson symbolism has wound its way through Ford 's life . It played a starring role the first time he made a major career change , at 19 , when he was an actor and his stylist on a Prell commercial famously informed him his hairline was on the retreat . Accepting that he would lose this battle , Ford ditched any thought of being the next Richard Gere then and there . But not show business . " You can get through almost anything if you can act-even tough things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you have to be nice and polite and on , and you 've done this collection where you are putting something out there-like purple nipples-just for everyone to say , " So stupid ! " Sure , sometimes they think it 's great . But just putting yourself out there is exhausting . After a show , I have something like postpartum depression , even before I read a review . " The reviews mattered a lot to this designer who lived by the fax and died by the fax . " After a show , the reviews follow me around wherever I am . Domenico De Sole trusts me to produce collections that sell and get decent reviews . And yeah , I read them , and sometimes I get upset . But I get over it in two or three days . " There were those in the audience who sniffed at the separated-at-birth symmetry between what he was doing for Gucci and what he was doing at Saint Laurent . " Sometimes people say that , but people are always saying things like that , " an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rodin Museum . " You know what people are like . " The suits at PPR were reading the papers too . Shouldering all those labels was perhaps too much for their megalo-creative director , so PPR wanted YSL to be handed off to someone else . But Ford would have none of it . He described his job as dressing two characters in a film . " They may both be beautiful and they may both be roughly the same age and they may both have money and they may both be sexually available . But the Gucci woman is sweeter , more naive . She may be like , " You 're a great guy , let 's fuck . ' The Saint Laurent woman is more twisted , more perverse . She is going to tie you up and slap you around before she finally lets you have sex with her . And a lot of that does n't come so much from Yves , it comes from all those provocative Helmut Newton pictures of YSL clothes from the ' ' 70s . " The YSL woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . Hair more fabulous than Farrah 's . " It is not meek hair , " asserted Ford , who wished the YSL customer had daywear as exuberant as the evening clothes hanging in her closet . But then , it was her musky after-dark decadence that lured him to the house in the first place . Ford was addressing this , just as he had rectified her shoe and bag and jewelry situation . There had been enamel cuffs this season at YSL , for example . But next door at Gucci , there were cuffs spritzed with enamel , too . " I think about this all the time , " said Ford . " YSL and Gucci are completely different . Often I 'll do a stiletto , Prada will do a stiletto , Versace will do a stiletto , Marc Jacobs will do a stiletto and he shouts , It 's the stiletto season ! But everyone 's stiletto is different . " He remembered an acting teacher who once told him to decide which shoes his character would have worn ; put them on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high heels : " If I could get myself into higher heels as a man , I would probably wear them , because I 'm not that tall . " He pointed to his cowboy-style boots that jack him up to a precise six-foot-one . Shoes have always been wildly important to the bottom line , and Ford started producing more of them than ever . " The next great bag may be a shoe , " he said , noting that people can get fed up with bags . Not that Ford had n't been lucky with them-his string of hits at Gucci include the Hawaiian-print Jackie O. and the bamboo-handle logo . Over at YSL , the horn-handle Mombasa still has the fashion flock in a frenzy . And lately , Ford was rolling in clover over his giant horse-bit chain clutch , introduced last year at Gucci- " a big , big , big hit " ( Ford tends to file his adjectives in triplicate ) - and tweaked this season with jewel-encrusted serpents . He was still unsure about the three complementary dresses , each slithering with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he confessed . Luckily , the magazine editors were n't scared off-though a few pulled the word tacky off the shelf . " Tacky is such a dumb word , " said Ford . " But sometimes tacky sells really well . " In his wildly glam collection for Gucci , the snakes recalled Versace at its most viable , as did the neon marabou jackets that appeared elsewhere on his runway , along with the metallic-fringe purses and dresses that looked like Ford ran them through Enron 's paper shredder . When I asked about rumors the Milanese house had recently approached him about a job , Ford responded with a smirk and a " No comment . " And Donatella Versace was n't talking . ( " It behooved Tom and Domenico to keep the idea out there that there was an easy plan for them to go somewhere else , " said a source close to the situation . " Gucci and Versace had planned to merge in 1995 , and Domenico has known the Versace family for about 35 years . But these were nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sharp-toothed critic might deem commercial . Ford remembered when he started out and was golden , " Calvin Klein said , " Enjoy it . When you 're on your way up , nothing you can do is wrong . ' And then you get to a level where some people start to hate everything you do because you 're " too commercial . " " I am a commercial designer , " Ford said flatly . " What I do is create a perishable commodity that is going to be sold and that people are going to wear . " This is a business built on the perishable commodity . Ford had asked Beyonce Knowles to record a special version of " Crazy in Love " for Gucci 's spring show . " No one can sit still when that song is on . I was going to cover the runway with one million candy hearts that said GUCCI . " Then Marc Jacobs played " Crazy in Love " at his show . Heartbroken , Tom dumped Beyonce . " The clues for what 's happening next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thing is , we 're all looking for them . " And Ford was good at finding the trail . The post-9/11 recession deflated sales in the past two years , in part because his customers tend to buy more when traveling . " Luckily , the last season or two have been good , so we 're on a roll again , " Ford said-before everything unraveled , that is . Even if he had preferred to replace himself as Gucci 's designer , it was none of PPR 's business . " Whether I replace myself here or there should be of no concern as long as we deliver a certain performance . " Ford went on : " When we became a multibrand company , we knew how long it would take to build Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen . Both are absolutely exceeding their business plans . And we told the market YSL would be profitable in 2005 . This is at the crux of our agreement or disagreement : If we continue to have this autonomy-as long as we deliver results-we 'll be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In a Wall Street Journal article , Bernard Arnault , chairman of rival luxury group LVMH , claimed he had given Dior designer John Galliano creative pointers . Was PPR looking for that role at Gucci Group ? " They wo n't get it . And I do n't approve of it , " Ford said . And certainly , the YSL woman was already applauding his efforts . This past fall , she was crazy in love with the black leather pants , the ones with the peekaboo-lace booty . Even if they were alarmingly incompatible . ( " Unfortunately , I ca n't screen and say , " Well , you can buy this and you ca n't , " ' Ford said . ) The gem-tone velvet blazers cinched with satin bows were claimed by Demi Moore , Sarali Jessica Parker-and Ford 's 68-year-old mother . Ford admitted he was still downloading this decade , still feeling things out : " Believe it or not , I am a little sick of blatant sexual poses in advertising . " This from the man who shaved a G @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snap the results . But Gucci s fall 2003 ad campaign only winked at kink ; glamazons in thigh-high boots were accessorized with squeaky babies . Not that sex was ever going to be tossed out with the bathwater : " Sex is like food , " said Ford . " You eat and you 're still hungry the next day . " Today , there are silver threads poking out of Ford 's exuberant thatch of chest hair . The two-day beard the designer once carefully cultivated to look older will probably come off at some point-like the hair up top-in the interest of looking younger , Ford said . Now mainly residing in London , he 's raising just one smooth fox terrier puppy named Angus at his Chelsea house . He appreciates the civility , the manners , the formality here across the Channel , " probably because I 'm starting to get old . I was born a 55-year-old man and I 'm growing into it . I was a grown-up when I was four . I was wearing a little blazer and I wanted to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappearing into the movie business . ( " It sounds silly because everyone wants to be a director , " he told me , slightly mortified . ) " It would only take Tom six months to pick that up , " said Richard Bucldey , Ford 's companion of 17 years and the editor of Vogue Hommes International . " Tom is very focused . " Ford made close to $6 million in 2002 and has already cashed stock options worth around $182 million . As he neared the finish line of the heated negotiations , he insisted he had n't given serious thought to leaving . " Domenico and I built this company around us and our idiosyncrasies . I love the company , and I hope this will all work out , " he said . When asked to consider the what ifs , he spoke more about buying and renovating another label-but nothing that would bear his name . Ford would never want his red-white-and-blue handle on something he 'd one day relinquish as Saint Laurent finally did . " I might buy my own company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I 've always said I would n't do that . I would run it as a business as opposed to necessarily design . " Ford was tan , courtesy of a few stolen days in Barbados where he was considering the clues for how it might all play out . " A lot of us got into this business because we loved style , but the business of fashion can be very different from that love of style , " he said , wistfully . He admitted he had considered leaving the business more than once . " You can tell which designers do n't like women , or which designers do n't care about the customer , or who is tired and over it . It 's a tough , tough , tough business . But you can live through it and endure it and survive it and still love it . " He smiled shyly . " And I still do love it . " Sidebar " I think about this all the time , " said Ford .
