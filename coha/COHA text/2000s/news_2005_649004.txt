<p> If Joyce Harris were to ever watch her son pitch , she would notice the same things everyone else does . His corkscrew windup . His enthusiasm . The boyish way he slaps his mitt after a strikeout , bounding toward the dugout without touching his cleats to the first-base line , his jaw working a wad of gum the size of a fish filet . <p> She would probably also notice the way her son , Dontrelle Willis , is maturing as a pitcher . Only 23 years old and in his second full season with the Florida Marlins , Willis has lowered his famously high leg kick , giving him a more consistent delivery . He no longer presses as much , either , which helps him work out of jams . Such growth has earned him a 6-0 record , including three complete games , a streak of 23 scoreless innings and a league-low earned run average of 1.07 . He was named the National League pitcher of the month for April . <p> All of which might please Harris , 45 , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Willis takes the mound for the Marlins , Harris lies in her bed here in an Oakland exurb , staring at the ceiling . Maybe she will turn on " Law &; Order " or " Forensic Files . " If she watches baseball at all , it will be a different game , no closer to her son than the scores crawling across the bottom of the screen . Friends call every inning with updates , knowing she is interested , knowing she is suffering . <p> " I ca n't watch him , " she said . " I even ca n't listen to the announcers on TV say he 's struggling or he 's sweating or he 's in trouble . When I look at him , I do n't see a major league baseball player or an All-Star or a pitcher who won a World Series ring . When I look at him out there , I still see my 12-year-old boy , Dontrelle . And then all I want to do is protect him . " <p> Willis and his mother have always been close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Harris weaved her son 's initials into a rose tattoo blooming above her left breast . Willis refers to his mother as his hero . He keeps a framed picture of her on a shelf of his locker . In her honor he has inked her name onto the bill of his Marlins cap . <p> " We 're almost too tight , almost like brother and sister instead of mother and son , " Willis said . " Those things a mother might normally shield from her son she did n't keep from me , so we went through the struggles together . " <p> But as he grows up professionally , he is growing into his own life . <p> In Willis 's first year with the Marlins , Harris called him every day . Now they can go three days without speaking . Willis used to spend his off-seasons here , crashing at his mother 's apartment . Now he lives at the Seminole Hard Rock Casino in Hollywood , Fla . <p> " I go back when I can , but my life is here now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends and all that . " <p> Harris chooses to stay in Alameda . She likes walking to the Central Cinema , a funeral home turned into a first-run movie theater , stopping first at Forster 's for a cone dipped in chocolate . She meets her gang at Peet 's coffee , which they prefer over the Starbucks across the street . At least four times a week  --  usually more  --  she grazes the buffet at La Pinata Mexican restaurant . When the Marlins play the Giants , Harris rides the ferry across San Francisco Bay , pacing in the stands when her son pitches . <p> " She has her own life , " said Sharon Peskett , her sister . " Even if Dontrelle does n't play another day , she 's still going to have her job . She takes classes . She has her speaking engagements . She 's still his mother , no matter what , but she 's letting him go . " <p> Harris is known primarily as Dontrelle 's mom , or Momma Willis or Mrs. Willis , even though she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through her son much the way a military wife 's is linked to her husband . When Willis made it to the majors in 2003 as a rookie sensation , Harris enjoyed the attention . At televised playoff games , she was shown wearing an engineer 's cap in honor of her son 's nickname , D-Train . On visits to Miami during baseball season , she would bounce from tailgate to tailgate in the stadium parking lot , posing for pictures . <p> " She enjoyed being on stage initially , " said Frank Guy , her brother . " But people will put you on that stage because you 're his mom . Like at the World Series , you could see that the cameras were about to focus on her , and then they did . She 's not asking for that , and in time she learned that it 's his stage and not hers . " <p> She has her own stage , anyway . She is a journeyman ironworker , a welder of the Bay Bridge , the Kong roller coaster at Marine World and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the past year and a half , she has worked for the California Building Trades Council , acting as a sort of recruiter . She drives to schools and community centers across the Bay Area , talking up the benefits of union membership . Apprentice ironworkers earn as they learn , she said , making as much as $12 an hour to start , which is considerably more than they would be making at a fast-food restaurant . At meetings , she is often introduced as Dontrelle 's mom . <p> " Which means I 'll have to spend 10 minutes talking about my son , which is n't what I 'm there to do , " she said . " Now if they want to pull me over in the hall afterward to talk about him , that 's fine , but I 'm there to do a job . " <p> Yet Harris still gives the D-Train tour of Alameda to anyone who asks . There is the mothballed aircraft carriers at the naval base . A plaque sticks to a concession stand in Rittler Park , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Little League . On the mound of Willie Stargell Field at Encinal High , Willis evolved from a gangly freshman into the California player of the year ; the No. 15 he wore is retired and hanging on the left-field tarp . There is the apartment they shared , where Harris still lives . Look closely at the red square painted on a wall in the parking lot . It is there that Willis debuted his leg kick while throwing tennis balls with neighborhood youngsters . When producers from HBO came out to film a segment on her son , Harris set out a plate of cranberry muffins . <p> " I do this because it 's a part of my story , too , I guess , " she said . <p> Willis 's father left the scene soon after he was born , in Oakland , in 1982 . For the first decade of her son 's life , Harris struggled to keep steady work . The best job she held was as a part-time supervisor for United Parcel , working four days a week , taking home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his grandmother . Willis moved with Harris to Alameda when he was about 12 , and Harris joined Ironworkers Local 378 . <p> " She 'd come to games here right off the Bay Bridge , " Jim Saunders , Willis 's high school baseball coach , said . " She 'd be covered in so much dirt she looked like she 'd been playing mud football or something . " <p> Ironwork can leave people spent at the end of the work day . Harris still managed to attend almost all of her son 's games . Working as a volunteer , Harris bent rebar to help build a skateboard park on the naval base . She molded a dance team from a handful of Encinal High girls . If her son stepped out of line in even a minor way , say by skipping class to get a haircut , she would be at the school at 3:30 p.m. , in the baseball team dugout , asking why she got a call from the principal . <p> " She generally knew what he was doing at all times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you never would have thought Dontrelle came from a one-parent family . " <p> Willis made it to the majors in 2003 , with the flat brim of his Marlins cap askew . His energy , along with a dazzling fastball , helped him win the rookie of the year award with a 14-6 record and helped the Marlins win a championship . Yet last season , the riddle of his windup appeared solved . Once opposing batters began hitting him , Willis tended to overthrow the ball , leading to more damage . His record fell to 10-11 . <p> There are several reasons for his return to form this season . He stuck to a rigorous off-season conditioning program . A new pitching coach fine-tuned his delivery . To learn how to pace himself through a marathon season , he follows the examples set by the veteran Marlins , like pitcher Al Leiter and outfielder Jeff Conine . <p> " Some of this stuff you can only learn by experience , " Willis said . " When to show up at the park , how to handle the fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything a bit better . " <p> He is better at acclimating to the life of a successful athlete . The day after he last pitched , against the Colorado Rockies , a clubhouse attendant pressed Willis 's clothes for a party after the game . Jeffrey Loria , the Marlins ' owner , ducked his head into Willis 's locker to congratulate him on another victory , and to let him know there were Miami Heat playoff tickets waiting for him at the will-call window . Willis recently bought his mother a Ford Expedition , which she sent down to her sister , Sharon , who lives outside Los Angeles . <p> She has passed on gifts before . After Willis won the World Series two years ago , he gave Harris a bejeweled Marlins logo , to be worn around her neck . The back of the pendant was inscribed , " To Mom : I love you , Dontrelle . " <p> Harris rarely wore the pendant , to her son 's consternation . She felt it was too ostentatious . In the last year , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willis , she has started wearing it regularly . <p> " Even though I knew the day would come when he would move on with his life , I do n't think as a mother you 're ever prepared for it , " she said . " It 's taken some getting used to . He was my whole life .
