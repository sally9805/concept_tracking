To watch him now , dropping in three-pointer after three-pointer for the Bucks , one would never guess that for years coaches grimaced and big men prepared for long rebounds whenever Michael Redd took aim from deep . " I did n't have too much confidence in my shot , " says Redd , who hit only 31.9% of his tries from behind the arc as the shooting guard at Ohio State . " My legs would get tired , and I 'd put up line drives . I knew I needed to work on it to play in the league . " // Apparently , so did everyone else . An aggressive slasher during his three years with the Buckeyes , the 6 ' 6 " Redd went 43rd in the 2000 draft because of doubts about his outside touch . At Milwaukee 's training camp coach George Karl , never a man known for coddling rookies , took Redd aside and made his position known . " I told him , ' Guards in the NBA need to have a body , and they have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " ' and until you 've got all that , I 'll be ignoring you . ' " // Redd got the picture . After appearing in six games , scoring 13 points and missing his three three-point attempts last season , he spent the summer in the gym at his alma mater , West High , in Columbus , Ohio . Under the watchful eye of his father , Wes  --  who has been encouraging his son to hone his stroke ever since he put a pink trash can in the hallway and gave two-year-old Michael a pair of rolled-up socks to heave into it  --  Redd went to work on his shot and his conditioning . From 10 a.m. until noon he 'd put up 400 to 500 junipers . After running sprints and getting a bite to eat , he 'd return at 1 p.m. and hoist J 's for another hour . Finally , after weight work , he 'd head back at 3 p.m. and fire away for a half hour more . Slowly but surely the Ichiro-esque line drives turned into well-arced shots that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me confidence , " says Redd . " I got to the point where I knew I could shoot . " // The change has been evident this season . At week 's end Redd , whose intense play in practice won over Karl " about midway through last season , " according to the coach , was averaging 11.0 points in 21.5 minutes and shooting 46.9% , including 43.1% from three-point range . Redd has also shown a knack for delivering with the game on the line . He forced a second overtime with a last-second three in a 129-127 loss to the Knicks on Jan. 26 ; a week later he knocked down a triple with eight seconds left to bring the Bucks to within three against the 76ers , though Milwaukee bowed 86-81 . Such accuracy in the clutch has earned Redd the respect of his teammates . Ray Allen is a big supporter ( though he notes that Redd finishes his jumper with his hands down , " like he 's a pimp or something " ) , and Sam Cassell bestows upon Redd that enviable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who would have ever predicted that ? " It 's crazy , " says Redd , who will be a free agent after this season . " My old coaches tease me all the time . They 're like , ' You are not a shooter ! ' It 's foreign to me , being called that . " He pauses , then smiles and adds , " But I certainly do n't mind it one bit . "
