Amid landscapes of destruction , many of those displaced by the recent swarm of hurricanes are still picking up the pieces of their lives . // Where have you gone New Orleans ? Yes , New Orleans will bounce back . Taxis and buses and limousines will leave hotels and casinos , cutting in and out of traffic to deliver passengers to Louis Armstrong International Airport . They will pass by homes and apartments and offices and neighborhood grocery stores and neighborhood bars that had been , now gone but for the debris . Yes , New Orleans will bounce back , because the taxis and buses and limousines will bring people back from Louis Armstrong airport to hotels and casinos , passing by the debris of Katrina . New Orleans will come back because the debris of homes and lives will eventually be cleared away from the streets , and the people in the taxis and buses , and especially those in limousines , will look out the window and forget what had been . Yes , after clearing all the debris of clothing and toys and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Sears , Roebuck in the forties ) and dressers and washstands and old pianos-and handbags and tricycles and broken dishes and dolls with one arm and no head and old laceless boxing gloves-after all this has been cleared away , New Orleans will come back . New Orleans will come back after the old sidewalks and potholes in the streets have been repaired . Yes , New Orleans will come back after bulldozers have knocked down homes in the Ninth Ward and cleared away all remnants of the people who lived there . New Orleans will come back when streetcars run up and down St. Charles Street , and tourists wo n't be afraid of getting off anywhere . New Orleans will come back when infrastructure is back in place on streets like Gentilly , when trees and flowers like azaleas and camellias and magnolias are blooming again on Esplanade . New Orleans will come back when you can go to Dooky Chase and order your favorite Creole meal , and later visit Snug Harbor , where the bartender knows exactly how you like your martini . Yes , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times when you can cross Bourbon Street in front of traffic , knowing all the time they wo n't dare hit you because this is the Big Easy , and you can do anything you like . You can walk down Royal Street and look into antique shops , dreaming but never buying . Or you can go to Caf du Monde for beignets and caf au lait . There will be musicians out on the sidewalk-they may not be the same ones as before Katrina , but there will be music . And there will be the old carriages , driven by old men , with tired old mules , and you can go for a ride in the French Quarter or along the French Market . . . . Yes , New Orleans will come back after politicians have argued over what part of the city should be rebuilt , and what part of the city should not be rebuilt at all . There will be town meetings , and there will be private citizens screaming at politicians , but in the end New Orleans will be rebuilt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Orleans . But I imagine stories of loss , and I wonder . The Joseph sisters-so we will call them , for this is only a story-used to walk two miles to church every Sunday in starched white dresses and white hats and white gloves . They walked Indian style on the narrow , broken sidewalk , the older sister in front , the younger one a pace or two behind . Every Sunday they would go to the nine o'clock service . They would come back a couple of hours later , take off their neat white dresses , hats , and gloves , and put on everyday wearing clothes and sit out on the porch . But Katrina changed all that . The older sister was drowned when six feet of water came into the house . The other sister was rescued and taken away . Some said she was taken to Houston , some said Detroit . Others said they believed she went to Atlanta , but they were n't sure . Or imagine a man standing among the crowd on Canal Street watching the Mardi Gras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the man remembered one voice , a little boy who called out to the floats : " Throw me something , mister , throw me something , throw me something , mister , throw me something . " There were thousands and thousands of screaming voices , but the man remembered that one voice . Each time one of the revelers on the floats would throw something-a doubloon , a string of beads , a plastic horn , or a plastic whistle-someone else would get to the prize before the boy did . Then the man had the luck to catch a red plastic horn , but when he looked for the boy , the boy was not there . Who was that little boy ? Where did he go ? Why did he leave before he got his treasure ? The man heard another voice behind him , a woman 's , saying , " You gon ' keep that little horn , mister ? I got some beads for my little girl , but nothing for my little boy . He sure would like that little red horn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the storm , imagine this same man driving down South Claiborne Avenue , where he noticed a little red plastic horn on a pile of debris . He wondered if it could possibly be the same one he had given to the woman . No , no , it could not be . The people on the floats must have thrown thousands of those things since then . But he still wondered . What had happened to the woman ? What had happened to her children ? Were they alive , scattered all over the country , or were they dead ? There are other stories-true stories-just like these . New Orleans , New Orleans , New Orleans , you will come back . But will you be my New Orleans , or the little boy 's New Orleans , or the woman 's New Orleans , or the Joseph sisters ' New Orleans ? I doubt it . Katrina and the politicians have made you a different New Orleans forever .

" I hung them there to show how quickly life can change . " New Orleans Houses and cars were half buried when the London Avenue Canal 's floodwall gave way , unleashing water and sand . " The car is sitting in the front yard of the house next to my aunt and uncle 's house , " says Maureen Lillich . " They both drowned in the rushing water . I do n't think the rest of the nation realizes the sorrow and struggle we continue to endure . All these months have passed , and my aunt and uncle 's neighborhood still looks devastated .

But the house , built solid , suffered no structural damage , just a broken window-pane , and Gettridge , now 82 , is steadily rehabilitating it . " I 've been in the building trades all my life , " he says . " I can still build anything I can think of . " Holly Beach , Louisiana " It was the poor man 's Riviera , " says Lecaster Leger , who owned one of the hundreds of tiny vacation houses washed away by Hurricane Rita 's 15-foot storm surge last September . Because of new building regulations-larger lots , higher elevations-many people ca n't afford to rebuild . " It wo n't be poor man 's anything anymore , " Leger says . New Orleans Six months after Katrina splintered the modest houses and wrecked the cars , the Lower Ninth Ward remained a scene of apocalypse and a reflection of lives thrown into chaos .

Baton Rouge , Louisiana Katrina felled a pine that cut the Jenkins family 's trailer home in two . Since then , they 've lived most of the time in a hotel room an hour away , cramped by salvaged possessions . Piles of handcopied paperwork document their appeals to FEMA , the agency that pays for the room , for disaster aid to replace their uninsured trailer .

Biloxi , Mississippi Harrah 's Biloxi Grand Casino barge was condemned after Katrina swept it ashore . Even though Gulf Coast gambling palaces sustained severe damage ( Katrina knocked out all 13 casinos on the Mississippi coast ) , they are one part of the local economy that is roaring back , to the relief of state and local officials , who collect hundreds of millions of dollars in gambling taxes . Three casinos were back in business by late 2005 , and Harrah 's said it would reopen the Grand this year . Punta Gorda , Florida The FEMA trailer park is wedged between a cow pasture and a jail .
