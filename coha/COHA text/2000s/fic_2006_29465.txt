Chapter One By the time Dave Johnson saw the oncoming headlights it was too late to do anything but hold on and pray . He jammed his foot onto the brake pedal and twisted the wheel to the left , but the blur of steel and glass still came straight for the passenger side of his pickup . It was weird . One part of his mind knew things were happening in split seconds , but everything also seemed to slow down , like an instant replay where the sportscasters try to show whether the receiver 's foot was or was n't inbounds when he caught the ball . Dave heard Clarice screaming as the oncoming car slammed into the side of his Club Cab . Tortured metal squealed and there was a crunch as the safety glass in the passenger window disintegrated . Dave felt the air whoosh from his lungs as his chest slammed into the shoulder harness ; the pickup skidded sideways and the tires screamed against the pavement . Finally , everything stopped moving . Dave 's fingers were jerky and uncertain from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the button on his seat belt . He pulled the latch and shoved against his door . To his surprise , it swung open easily , as if nothing had happened . The damage must be completely on the passenger 's side . Clarice ! He leaned toward her . " Baby ! You okay ? Clarice ? " Her eyes were closed and her head lay back on the headrest , her face turned toward him . Dave'sheart crowded up under his Adam 's apple . He put his hand on her neck , then her chest , feeling for a pulse , for breathing , for anything . " Clarice , honey ! Wake up , baby ! " There ... her chest rose and fell . She was breathing . Relief flooded through Dave like cold water rushing over parched ground . She was alive . But why would n't she wake up ? Dave got out of the truck and ran around to the passenger side . He sucked in a breath . The right side , from the passenger door to halfway across the front quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pinned inside the vehicle . Someone was grabbing at him , talking to him . " Oh my Lord , man , I 'm so sorry ! " Dave pulled his eyes away from the pickup and looked into the pale , scared face of a kid who might be as old as seventeen . He had his cap turned backward and the ragged , sleeveless T-shirt he was wearing said something about not caring so much about reality . His chin had a few stray reddish-blond hairs sprouting from it , the beginnings of a beard . " Man , I tried to stop , I swear to God . Was the light red ? Oh God , man , are you okay ? " " You got a cell phone ? " Dave said . The kid nodded . " Call 911 . " " Okay , man , but are you okay ? " " Just dial it ! My wife 's in there and she ca n't get out . " " Oh , sweet Jesus- " " Dial the phone ! " The kid 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , okay . " He tugged a palm-sized silver phone out of his pocket , flipped it open , and started punching buttons . People were coming out of the grocery store located at one corner of the intersection . Somebody was trying to direct traffic around the scene . Another onlooker peered into Clarice 's window . Dave turned back to his pickup . " I saw the whole thing , " a man said while coming up behind Dave . " You had the green light . The kid never even slowed down . Probably high or drunk or something . " " My wife 's in there and I think she 's pinned , " Dave called , running around to the driver 's side . In the distance , he heard a siren . He crawled back inside and realized the pickup 's engine was still running . He switched it off and leaned over his wife , cupping the crown of her head in his hand . Should n't move her , in case of spinal injuries . She 's breathing , thank you , Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for somebody in shock ? When 's the ambulance gon ' get here ? Is gas leaking out under the truck ? Hope somebody makes sure that kid do n't run off . Are the paramedics here yet ? Is my wife dying ? He stroked her cheek . " Clarice ? Boo , I 'm here with you . Baby girl , can you wake up ? " Her lips moved and she let out a low moan . Her eyes shifted back and forth beneath closed eyelids . " Clarice ? Baby , can you hear me ? " The moan was louder this time . Her eyelids fluttered , then opened . Dave thought she was looking at him . " Hey , Reesie . That you ? " He tried to smile . Clarice moaned again , and this time the sound swelled and climbed the scale all the way to a scream . " David , my leg , my leg ! Lord Jesus have mercy , David , I think my leg must be broken ! " She clawed at him and shoved uselessly against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dave stared helplessly and tried to gentle her with his hands , his voice . " Shh now , baby girl , we gon ' get you out , do n't you worry . They almost here , we gon ' get you out of there and you 'll be fine , you 'll see . Easy now , baby . " He might as well have been talking to the wind . Clarice moaned and twisted her body as much as she could . The pain was killing her , she said . " David , do something , get me some help , " she pleaded . Dave hopped out of the truck just as a fire engine pulled up , its air brakes yelping and hissing . Two firefighters jumped out of the cab and a third was already pulling a chemical extinguisher from a rack and eyeing the pavement beneath the two vehicles . As they came toward him , Dave noticed the kid 's car , a mid-nineties Bronco . He realized he did n't need to worry about the boy fleeing the scene ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand grenade under the hood , then taken a jackhammer to the front grille . Dave had a fleeting sense of grim satisfaction . " That your wife in there ? " the firefighter asked him . Dave nodded . " I think she 's pinned . Her leg 's hurting pretty bad , " he said , though he probably did n't need to , since Clarice 's announcements about her condition had not decreased in volume . It was good to hear her voice , though ; it told him she was at least well enough to keep her lungs aired out . " We 'll have to get the can opener , " the firefighter said . He turned to his colleagues . " Hey , guys , we need the Jaws . " He went over to Clarice 's window and started talking to her . Dave noticed she seemed to be listening , nodding every once in a while . Good . She could n't be that badly off if she could understand and respond . But her twisted face said she was still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crash . He and Clarice had been arguing-a scene all too common these last few months , it seemed . Dave searched his memory for any clue that his frustration with Clarice might have caused him to pay less attention . If Clarice had n't been going off on him , would he have noticed the kid speeding up to the red light ? He could tell when he came home that the evening was n't going to be smooth . The Board of Realtors dinner was that night , and would n't you know it , one of his building managers had a shift leader quit right before closing time . Dave had to go over there and calm down the agitated manager , then walk her through the process of setting up a temporary shift roster so the building would be covered . They 'd figure out a more permanent solution the next day , he told her . The main thing was that the customer 's building was clean and ready for the next day 's business . So he got home an hour late , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the hands-on-her-hips pose told Dave Mama ai n't happy . Which was no big surprise , but he was hoping that for once he could get his explanation in without her going all eastside-westside on him . He could n't . " Are you telling me some minimum-wage vacuum jockey is going to cause me to be late to my professional dinner ? Is that the best reason you can come up with to embarrass me in front of my peers ? " Clarice 's voice was rising and falling like a preacher coming to the end of a sermon . She had her dress on , the nice silky red one that draped her just right . She was made up , her lipstick all shiny and wet-looking on her full , soft lips . She was looking fine , or would , if her face wore some expression besides the one she was aiming at him now , looking at him like he was some raggedy , no-count kid who 'd knocked a baseball through the front window of her plans for the evening . Clarice had one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and wagged it at Dave as she preached ; he found it hard to take his eyes off the three-inch spike heel , considering the mood she was in right now . " I could n't help it , Boo , I told you . Charmaine 's my newest manager and I had to walk her through this one time . " " This one time . This one time , did you say ? " Dave caught himself listening for the organist to start the altar call . " How many times have you had to drop everything to rescue one of your managers ? " The way she said the last word , it sounded like it had quote marks around it . " How many times have I gotten home , thinking we might have a quiet evening together for once , only to find out somebody did n't show up somewhere , and you had to take it on yourself to cover ? I 'm so tired of this , David . I work so hard at the agency to be professional . I work so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a way that speaks well of me ... and my family . " " Clarice , I know you do . You the hardest-working woman I ever saw . All I 'm sayin ' is- " " But it discourages me when , at any moment , my husband can disrupt what I 'm trying so hard to cultivate . It discourages me that I ca n't even count on one simple evening to go as I expected . " " Baby , we 'll get to the dinner . Just let me shower and change real quick . " She looked at him slantways , clearly skeptical . They 'd walked out of the house fifteen minutes before the dinner was to start , and Dave thought they were going to make it . The drive was silent for the first three or four minutes . Maybe , just this once , Clarice would resist the urge to take up her campaign for him to sell his janitorial business and find work " that amounts to something . " But just after he pulled out onto South First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to hear this , but- " He felt his shoulders droop and a sigh went out of him . He fastened his eyes on the road ahead and let Clarice 's lecture tumble past his ears without stopping , like some kind of really annoying elevator music . Why could n't she just be satisfied with him the way he was ? What was wrong with All-Pro Janitorial and Carpet Cleaning ? It was a good business , and he 'd built it from the ground up , one contract at a time . After years of teaching and coaching , he finally had his dream : self-employment . They had a nice house and two low-mileage cars , and the only reason Clarice was still selling real estate was supposed to be for vacation money . These last couple of years , though , Dave had begun to suspect there was more to it than that . Dave watched the firefighters positioning the Jaws of Life , a steel contraption with hoses and handles leading off every which way . The blades looked like they could cut through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , the firefighters positioned them at the seam between the passenger door and front quarter panel of his pickup . He heard the whine of the hydraulics and watched the blades bite into the frame of his truck . The metal growled and popped as the bottom hinge separated like construction paper cut by scissors . One of the men bent to support the door 's weight as they moved the Jaws to cut the top hinge . " Lean away from the door as much as you can , ma'am , " one of them said to Clarice as Dave approached . " Can I help ? " he asked . " Stand back for just a moment , sir , and then we 'll get you to help us make sure we get the door off without hurting her . " The Jaws sheared the top hinge and the door 's weight settled into the firefighter 's hands . Slowly and carefully , checking with Clarice all the while , they peeled away the caved-in door . Dave scanned Clarice 's right side and was almost sick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if it contained pipe cleaner instead of bone . Already the swelling and purpling had transformed her shapely calf and ankle into something resembling a huge spoiled sausage . Her red high heel was still on her foot , but the flesh of her ankle had swollen around it so that the edges of the pump were starting to cut into her . " Oh , baby girl . We got to get you to a hospital . " " That looks like a pretty bad break , " a firefighter said . " Anybody heard from the paramedics ? " He reached for his walkie-talkie . Clarice was moaning softly now , like a child worn out from too much crying . " It hurts , David . It hurts so bad . " " I know , Boo . We gon ' get you fixed up soon as we can . " He held her face and cooed to her , even as he wondered where on God 's earth the ambulance could be . In a minute or two , the ambulance whooped to a stop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , they gently and efficiently unfolded Clarice from the ruined pickup and positioned her on the stretcher . They unfolded something that looked like a beach toy and wrapped it around Clarice 's leg , fastening it with Velcro . They started pumping air into it with a small electric pump . " Inflatable splint , " one of the paramedics told Dave . " Should keep her leg still and more comfortable until we get her to the hospital . " A policeman tapped Dave on the shoulder . " Sir , I 've already talked to several witnesses and the driver of the other vehicle . Everybody seems pretty unanimous that the kid ran a red light . Could I just get a couple of minutes ? It 'll be that long before the ambulance is ready to transport her . Just need your name , address , phone number , that sort of thing . " Dave talked to the officer , all the time keeping one eye on Clarice and the paramedics surrounding her . They put a neck brace on her . " Just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her leg appeared to be broken in several places below the knee , and that she had severe bruising all along her right side and arm . One of them cut the shoe off her foot . Dave remembered the day Clarice had brought the shoes home . " Forty percent off at Talbot 's , " she told him triumphantly . Dave wondered how long it would be before she 'd be able to wear spike heels again . The paramedics loaded Clarice into the ambulance and Dave excused himself from the police officer . He crawled in beside his wife and took her hand . " How you doing , Reesie ? " She looked at him . " What 's going to happen , David ? Where we going ? " " To the hospital , baby . We got to get your leg fixed . " But she must have been addled from the pain , because it was like he had n't said anything . " Where we going , David ? Where we going ? " She kept saying it , over and over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand and wished the ambulance would hurry up and get moving . ( Continues ... )
