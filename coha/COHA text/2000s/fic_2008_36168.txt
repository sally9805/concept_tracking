Hospitals are where people go to be saved , but the doctors can only patch you up , put you back together . They ca n't undo the damage . They ca n't make it so you did n't wake up in the bad place , or change the truth to lies . The nice doctor and the nice woman from the SART , Sexual Assault Response Team , could n't change that I had indeed been raped . The fact that I could n't remember it , because my uncle had used a spell for his date-rape drug , did n't change the evidence  --  the evidence that they 'd found in my body when they did the exam and took samples . <br> You would think being a real live faerie princess would make your life fairy-tale-like , but fairy tales only end well . While the story is going on , horrible things happen . Remember Rapunzel ? Her prince got his eyes scratched out by the witch , which blinded him . At the end of the story , Rapunzel 's tears magically restored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story . Cinderella was little better than a slave . Snow White was actually nearly killed four different times by the evil queen . All anyone remembers is the poisoned apple , but do n't forget the huntsman , or the enchanted girdle and the poisoned comb . Pick any fairy tale that 's based on older stories , and the heroine of the piece has a miserable , dangerous , nightmarish time of it . <br> I am Princess Meredith NicEssus , next in line to a high throne of faerie , and I 'm in the middle of my story . The happy-ever-after ending , if it 's coming at all , seems a very long way away tonight . <br> I was in a hospital bed , in a nice private room , in a very nice hospital . I was in the maternity ward , because I was pregnant , but not with my crazy uncle 's baby . I had been pregnant before he stole me away . Pregnant with the children of men I loved . They 'd risked everything to rescue me from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the greatest warriors that faerie had ever seen at my side : Doyle , once the Queen 's Darkness , and now mine . He stood at the window , staring off into the night that was so ruined by the lights from the hospital parking lot that the blackness of his skin and hair was much darker than the night outside . He 'd removed the wraparound sunglasses that he almost always wore outside . But his eyes were as black as the glasses that hid them . The only color in the dim light of the room was the glints from the silver rings that climbed the graceful line of one ear to the point that marked him as not pure blood , not truly high court , but mixed blood , like me . The diamonds in his earlobe sparkled in the light as he turned his head , as if he 'd felt me staring at him . He probably had . He had been the queen 's assassin a thousand years before I was born . <br> His ankle-length hair moved like a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green hospital scrubs that he 'd been loaned . They had replaced the blanket from the ambulance that had brought us here . He 'd entered the golden court , to rescue me , in the form of a large black dog . When he shape-shifted he lost everything , clothes , weapons , but strangely never the piercings . The many earrings and the nipple piercing survived his return to human form , maybe because they were part of him . <br> He came to stand beside the bed , and take my hand  --  the one that did n't have the intravenous drip in it , which was helping hydrate me , and get me over the shock I 'd been in when I had arrived . If I had n't been with child , they 'd have probably given me more medicine . For once I would n't have minded stronger drugs , something to make me forget . Not just what my uncle , Taranis , had done , but also the loss of Frost . <br> I gripped Doyle 's hand , my hand so small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there should have been another beside him , beside me . Frost , our Killing Frost , was gone . Not dead , not exactly , but lost to us . Doyle could shape-shift to several forms at will and come back to his true form . Frost had had no ability to shape-shift , but when wild magic had filled the estate where we 'd been living in Los Angeles , it had changed him . He had become a white stag , and run out the doors that had appeared into a piece of faerie that had never existed before the magic came . <br> The lands of faerie were growing , instead of shrinking , for the first time in centuries . I , a noble of the high courts , was with child , twins . I was the last child of faerie nobility to be born . We were dying as a people , but maybe not . Maybe we were going to regain our power , but what use to me was power ? What use to me was the return of faerie , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Frost was an animal with an animal 's mind ? <br> The thought that I would bear his child and he would neither know nor understand made my chest tight . I gripped Doyle 's hand , but could n't meet his eyes . I was n't sure what he would see there . I was n't sure what I was feeling anymore . I loved Doyle , I did , but I loved Frost , too . The thought that they would both be fathers had been a joyous one . <br> He spoke in his deep , deep voice , as if molasses , and other , thick , sweet things , could be words , but what he said was n't sweet . " I will kill Taranis for you . " <br> I shook my head . " No , you will not . " I had thought about it , because I had known that Doyle would do just what he 'd said . If I asked , he would try to kill Taranis , and he might succeed . But I could not allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Light and Illusion , the king of our enemy court . We were not at war , and even those among the Seelie Court who thought Taranis was mad or even evil would not be able to overlook an assassination . A duel , maybe , but not an assassination . Doyle was within his rights to challenge the king to a duel . I 'd thought about that , too . I 'd half liked that idea , but I 'd seen what Taranis could do with his hand of power . His hand of light could char flesh , and had nearly killed Doyle once before . <br> I had let go of any thought of vengeance at Doyle 's hand when I weighed it against the thought of losing him too . <br> " I am the captain of your guard , and I could avenge my honor and yours for that reason alone . " <br> " You mean a duel , " I said . <br> " Yes . He does not deserve a chance to defend himself , but if I assassinate him , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not afford that . " <br> " No , " I said , " we ca n't . " I looked up at him then . <br> He touched my face with his free hand . " Your eyes glow in the dark with a light of their own , Meredith . Green and gold circles of light in your face . Your emotions betray you . " <br> " I want him dead , yes , but I wo n't destroy all of faerie for it . I wo n't get us all kicked out of the United States for my honor . The treaty that let our people come here three hundred years ago stated only two things that would get us kicked out . The courts ca n't make war on American soil , and we ca n't allow humans to worship us as deities . " <br> " I was at the signing of the treaty , Meredith . I know what it said . " <br> I smiled at him , and it seemed strange that I could still smile . The thought made the smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a good sign . " You remember the Magna Carta . " <br> " That was a human thing , and had little to do with us . " <br> I squeezed his hand . " I was making a point , Doyle . " <br> He smiled , and nodded . " My emotions make me slow . " <br> " Me , too , " I said . <br> The door behind him opened . There were two men in the doorway , one tall and one short . Sholto , King of the sluagh , Lord of that Which Passes Between , was as tall as Doyle , and had long , straight hair that fell toward his ankles , but the color was white-blond , and his skin was like mine , moonlight pale . Sholto 's eyes were three colors of yellow and gold , as if autumn leaves from three different trees had been melted down to color his eyes , then everything had been edged in gold . The sidhe always have the prettiest eyes . He was as fair of face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frost . The body that showed under the t-shirt and jeans he 'd worn as part of his disguise when he came to save me seemed to cling to a body as lovely as the face , but I knew that at least part of it was illusion . Starting at his upper ribs , Sholto had extra bits , tentacles , because , though his mother had been high-court nobility , his father had been one of the nightflyers , part of the sluagh , and the last wild hunt of faerie . Well , the last wild hunt until the wild magic had returned . Now , things of legend were returning , and Goddess alone knew what was real again , and what was still to return . <br> Until he had a coat or jacket thick enough to hide the extra bits , he would use magic , glamour , to hide the extras . No reason to scare the nurses . It was his lifetime of having to hide his differences that had made him good enough at illusion to risk coming to my rescue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Illusion with illusion as your only shield . <br> He smiled at me , and it was a smile I had never seen on Sholto 's face until the moment at the ambulance when he had held my hand , and told me he knew he would be a father . The news seemed to have softened some harshness that had always been there in his handsome body . He seemed the proverbial new man , as he walked toward us . <br> Rhys was not smiling . At 5 ' 6 " , he was the shortest full-blooded sidhe I 'd ever met . His skin was moonlight pale , like Sholto 's , like mine , like Frost 's . Rhys had removed the fake beard and mustache he 'd worn inside the faerie mound . He 'd worked at the detective agency in L.A. with me , and he 'd loved disguises . He was good at them , too , better than at illusion . But he 'd had enough illusion to hide the fact that he only had one eye . The remaining eye was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court , but where his left eye had once lain was white scar tissue . He usually wore a patch in public , but tonight his face was bare , and I liked that . I wanted to see the faces of my men with nothing hidden tonight . <br> Doyle moved enough so Sholto could put a chaste kiss against my cheek . Sholto was n't one of my regular lovers . In fact , we 'd only been together once , but as the old saying goes , once is enough . One of the children I carried was part his , but we were new around each other , because in effect we 'd only had one date . It had been a hell of a first date , but still , we did n't really know each other yet . <br> Rhys came to stand at the foot of the bed . His curly white hair , which fell to his waist , was still back in the ponytail he 'd worn to match his own jeans and t-shirt . His face was very solemn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cromm Cruach , and before that he 'd been a god of death . He would n't tell me who , but I had enough hints to make guesses . He 'd told me that Cromm Cruach was god enough ; he did n't need more titles . <br> " Who gets to challenge him to the duel ? " Rhys asked . <br> " Meredith has told me no , " Doyle said . <br> " Oh , good , " Rhys said . " I get to do it . " <br> " No , " I said , " and I thought you were afraid of Taranis . " <br> " I was , maybe I still am , but we ca n't let this go , Merry , we ca n't . " <br> " Why ? Because your pride is hurt ? " <br> He gave me a look . " Give me more credit than that . " <br> " I will challenge him , then , " Sholto said . <br> " No , " I said . " No one is to challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other way . " <br> The three men looked at me . Doyle and Rhys knew me well enough to be speculative . They knew I had a plan . Sholto did n't know me that well yet . He was just angry . <br> " We ca n't let this insult stand , princess . He has to pay . " <br> Continues ...
