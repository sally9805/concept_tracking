<p> QUESTIONS FOR THE MOVIE ANSWER MAN <p> In my science-fiction film class , we were tying to determine the first film to use the " flying saucer " spaceship . The earliest film we could come up with was " The Day the Earth Stood Still " ( 1951 ) . Any thoughts ? <p> James Hrivnak , Waterloo , Ont . <p> A. Two 1950 movies were named " The Flying Saucer " and " The Flying Saucer Mystery . " <p> Q. There 's a big news story out about the West Memphis Three , subjects of the documentaries " Paradise Lost : The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills " ( 1996 ) and " Paradise Lost 2 : Revelations " ( 2000 ) . They may be exonerated on the basis of DNA evidence . Also , a new movie about them may be in the works . <p> Justin Weiss , Tokyo <p> A. I 've been writing about this case for years . The two documentaries , by Joe Berliner and Alan Sinofsky , compellingly argue that three young men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy metal and fit the local profile of " Satanic cult members . " The first doc showed us Terry Hobbs , stepfather of one of the victims . Now DNA evidence puts him , but not the three prisoners , at the scene . The full story is at http : **39;1568;TOOLONG , , 2204901,00. html . <p> Q. Re the Joy Division biopic " Control " : 1 ) Is it true that singer Ian Curtis hanged himself either while or after watching Werner Herzog 's " Stroszek " on TV ? 2 ) Was n't one of the ironies behind the name Joy Division ( besides the joylessness of the music itself ) that it 's a euphemism used by the Nazis for the brothels in concentration camps ? <p> Alan Partridge , Manchester , Pa . <p> A. Yes to both . You can see Bruno S. , the star of " Stroszek , " on the screen in Curtis ' house just before he kills himself . But why that film ? It does n't seem terminally depressing to me ( it 's in the Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fan , that 's why I read your site . However , does n't it seem odd that you 're not exactly raving about " Bee Movie , " and yet their ads are all over your site ? I understand the importance of advertising space ; however , in consideration of the similar industry , perhaps it 's a conflict of interest ? At a glance , someone may assume that you 're promoting this film . <p> Nicole Comer , Toluca Lake , Calif . <p> A. Not if they read my review . Have n't you noticed that movie ads and movie reviews do not always agree ? The ads are what make it possible for you to read the site . <p> Q. You recently reviewed " The Gates , " and in doing so shared your appreciation of " The Gates " themselves ( an appreciation I share ) . I 'm curious , though : Given your argument that video games can not be " high art " because they are open-ended , does this also disqualify " The Gates " ? <p> Stephen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would disqualify the Gateway Arch in St. Louis , Stonehenge or Schubert 's " Unfinished Symphony . " <p> Q. As for the driving directions to or from Barrow , Alaska , Google has become tame . At one time , you could ask it for directions from midtown Manhattan to Paris , and it would instruct you to head down to the docks , turn right and swim 4,000 miles . Now you just get that same bland " could not calculate " message . <p> Adam Weintraub , <p> Sacramento , Calif . <p> A. That 's better than wading ashore in New Jersey . <p> Q. I am delighted to see you finally list " Blade Runner ( The Final Cut ) " in the Great Movies Collection , as this is my favorite film . But you 've made the same mistake that you made in your previous reviews , which is regarding how many replicants Deckard needed to hunt down . Deckard 's police superior , Bryant , informs him that , indeed , six did escape ; however , as was noted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two were fried running through an electric field , " which nullifies any chance of Deckard being part of the renegade group of Nexus-6s . <p> However , a few things should be noted . Originally , Deckard was to hunt down five replicants , with only one , named Hodge , getting nailed in the field ( as reflected in the original theatrical/international and director releases ) . The fifth replicant was actually a character named Mary , and was to be portrayed by Stacy Nelkin , but her scenes were cut before filming began . This was far enough into production that Bryant made the dialogue mistake . Of course , it is a very valid theory that Deckard is , in fact , a replicant , perhaps even a Nexux-7 ( that 's not a typo ) , just not part of Roy 's group . <p> N.R. Klein , Pomona , N.J. <p> A. I am slowly beginning to realize I am a replicant , programmed to spread disinformation to put any loose ones in greater danger . <p> Q. The little boy who played Michael Clayton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet no credit has been given to him . He did a great acting job , and the book he was reading was so important to the story . <p> Joan Clark , Ketchum , Idaho <p> A. Praise to Austin Williams , 11 , who also played Timothy Hutton 's son in " The Good Shepherd . " <p> Q. I have enjoyed reading your views on the digital vs. film issue and was wondering if you had any update on how Dean Goodhill 's " Maxivision 48 " system has been coming along . Do you know of any directors who are actually considering using it for a feature production ? I was sad to read in one of your articles that Eastman House is going digital as well , and lately director Sidney Lumet has mentioned that film is going to be gone within 50 years . I would love to hear if you have any updates about Maxivision 48 . <p> Ibrahim Shankiti , Baghdad , Iraq <p> A. Goodhill is still optimistic . The process is so much better than 70mm or IMAX that it blows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons , including cost , speed and increasing quality , but a venture capitalist with imagination could transform epics such as comic superhero movies . If fanboys could see " Spider-Man " in Maxivision , you 'd never get them down at the multiplex again . <p> Q. I was watching " The Sixth Sense " with my cousins , and we got into a debate over whether Haley Joel Osment 's character in the movie knows that the Bruce Willis character is dead . I said he could not possibly know he is dead because he would have been scared to talk to him , but they pointed out that he does know and talks to him because he is not scared of him . Who do you agree with ? <p> Claudia Cruz , Riverside , Calif . <p> A. Your cousins . Cole says , " I see dead people . " So he knows they 're dead . He kindly does not always inform them . <p> Q. My girlfriend and I have attended the Chicago International Film Festival for many years ( I even once sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gates of Heaven . " ) We would like to attend another international film festival . Do you have a recommendation ? <p> Joseph Azazello , Chicago <p> A. Forget about Cannes , Berlin and Venice : Big deals , but expensive and you need credentials . Pick your dates and go online to www.filmfestivals.com . They list 1,400 fests . Near Chicago , the biggest and most user-friendly is Toronto . Montreal is making a comeback . I have had wonderful times at the Hawaii , Virginia and Savannah festivals . Telluride is magical but expensive and hard to get to . <p> Here in Chicago , we have many festivals , including the Latino , Animation , Reeling ( Gay/Lesbian ) , Underground , Short Film , Future Filmmakers , Asian Animation , Asian-American , Horror , International Children 's , Documentary , and Women in the Director 's Chair festivals . There 's hardly a week of the year without a festival going on here . And in Urbana-Champaign , you might enjoy the Insect Fear Film Festival , and also surf to www.ebertfest.com , with next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , SMILE , YOU 'VE MADE THIS READER 'S DAY <p> Q. Thank you for steering me to " The Greatest YouTube Clip of All Time , " with 100 movies , 100 scenes , 100 numbers . I enjoyed it immensely . I think I was identifying about half of the films without looking them up . How did you do ? <p> Ann Hubbard , Williamsburg , Va . <p> A. I got them all . Not always by title , of course . A lot of them , I correctly identified as , " Oh , yeah , that movie !
