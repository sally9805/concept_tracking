Edo Genroku Period , Year 3 , Month 9 ( Tokyo , October 1690 ) " It is my privilege to open this ceremony in which Sosakan Sano Ichiro and Lady Ueda Reiko shall be united in marriage before the gods . " Pudgy , nearsighted Noguchi Motoori -- Sano 's former superior and the go-between who had arranged the match -- solemnly addressed the assembly gathered in Edo Castle 's private reception hall . On this warm autumn morning , sliding doors stood open to a garden resplendent with scarlet maple leaves and brilliant blue sky . Two priests , clad in white robes and tall black caps , knelt at the front of the hall before the alcove , in which hung a scroll bearing the names of the kami -- Shinto deities . Below this , a dais held the traditional offerings of round rice cakes and a ceramic jar of consecrated sake . Two maidens , wearing the hooded cloaks of Shinto shrine attendants , stood near the priests . On the tatami to the left of the alcove knelt the bride 's father and closest associates : stout , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the right , the groom 's party consisted of Shogun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi , Japan 's supreme military dictator , dressed in brocade robes and the cylindrical black cap of his rank , attended by several high officials ; Sano 's frail , elderly mother ; and Hirata , Sano 's chief retainer . All eyes turned to the center of the hall , the focus of the ceremony . Sano and Reiko knelt side by side before two small tables -- he in black ceremonial robes stamped with his family 's gold flying-crane crest , his two swords at his waist ; she in a white silk kimono and a long , white silk drape that completely covered her face and hair . They faced a flat porcelain dish containing a miniature pine and plum tree , a bamboo grove , the statues of a hare and a crane : symbols of longevity , pliancy , and fidelity . Behind them , Noguchi and his wife knelt at a table reserved for the go-between . As the priests stood and bowed to the altar , Sano 's heart pounded . His stoic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years had brought him continuous upheaval : the death of his beloved father ; the move from his modest family home in the Nihonbashi merchant district to Edo Castle , Japan 's seat of power ; a dizzyingly rapid rise in status and all the associated challenges . At times he feared his mind and body could n't withstand the relentless onslaught of change . Now he was marrying a twenty-year-old girl he 'd met exactly once before , more than a year ago , at the formal meeting between their two families . Her lineage was impeccable , her father one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in Edo . But they 'd never spoken ; he knew nothing of her character . He barely remembered what she looked like , and would n't see her face again until the end of the ceremony . To Sano , the tradition of arranged marriage now seemed like sheer madness -- a potentially disastrous pairing of strangers . What perilous turn had his fate taken ? Was it too late to escape ? From her tiny bedchamber in the Edo Castle women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slamming doors , and shrill feminine voices . The dressing rooms would be littered with opulent silk kimonos and spilt face powder , the servants rushing to finish dressing the two hundred concubines and their attendants for the sosakan-sama 's wedding feast . But Harume , weary of the suffocating presence of so many other women after only eight months at the castle , had decided to skip the celebration . Privacy was almost nonexistent in the crowded women 's quarters , but now her chambermates were gone , the palace officials busy . The shogun 's mother , whom Harume attended , had n't required her services today . No one would miss her , she hoped -- because Harume meant to take full advantage of her rare solitude . She latched the door , then closed the shutters . On a low table she lit oil lamps and incense burners . The flickering flames cast her shadow against the mullioned paper walls ; the incense smoked , sweetly pungent . A hushed , secretive atmosphere permeated the room . Harume 's pulse quickened with a dark excitement . She set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold irises , and a porcelain sake decanter and two cups on the table . Her movements were slow and graceful , befitting a sacred ritual . Then she tiptoed to the door and listened . The noise had diminished ; the other women must have finished dressing and started toward the banquet hall . Harume returned to the altar she 'd created . With eagerness rising in her breast , she pushed back her glossy , waist-length black hair . She loosened her sash and parted the skirts of her red silk dressing gown . She knelt , naked from the waist down . She contemplated herself with pride . At age eighteen , she was as ripe of flesh as a mature woman , yet with youth 's fresh radiance . Flawless ivory skin covered her firm thighs , her rounded hips and stomach . With her fingertips Harume stroked the silky triangle of pubic hair . She smiled , remembering his hand there , his mouth against her throat , their shared rapture . She reveled in her eternal love for him , which she would now prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long wand tasseled with white paper strips , crying , " Evil out , fortune in ! Whoosh ! Whoosh ! " to purify the room . Then he chanted an invocation to the Shinto gods Izanagi and Izanami , revered procreators of the universe . Hearing the familiar words , Sano relaxed . The timeless ceremony lifted him above doubt and fear ; anticipation soared in him . No matter the risks , he wanted this marriage . At the advanced age of thirty-one , he was at last ready to make the decisive step into official adulthood , to take his place in society as the head of his own family . And he was ready for a change in his life . His twenty months as the shogun 's sosakan-sama  --  most honorable investigator of events , situations , and people  --  had been a nonstop cycle of criminal cases , treasure hunts , and spying assignments , culminating in a near-catastrophic trip to Nagasaki . There he had investigated the murder of a Dutch trader  --  and been shot , almost burned to death , charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd returned to Edo seven days ago , and while he had n't lost his desire to pursue truth and deliver criminals to justice , he was tired . Tired of violence , death , and corruption . The aftermath of a tragic love affair the previous year had left him lonely and emotionally drained . Now , however , Sano looked forward to a respite from the rigors of his work . The shogun had granted him a month 's holiday . After a yearlong betrothal , Sano welcomed the prospect of a private life with a sweet , compliant wife who would provide a haven from the outside world . He yearned for children , especially a son who would carry on his name and inherit his position . This ceremony was not just a social rite of passage , but a gateway to everything Sano wanted . The second priest played a series of high-pitched , wailing notes on a flute , while the first beat a sonorous accompaniment on a wooden drum . Now came the most solemn , sacred part of the wedding ritual . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a long-handled brass ewer and brought it to Sano and Reiko . The other attendant set before them a tray containing three flat wooden cups , graduated in size , nested together . From the ewer , the attendants filled the first , smallest cup , bowed , and handed it to the bride . The assembly waited in hushed expectation . Harume opened the lacquer box and took out a long , straight razor with a gleaming steel blade , a pearl-handled knife , and a small , square black lacquer jar with her name painted in gold on the stopper . As she arranged these objects before her , a tremor of fear fluttered in Harume 's throat . She dreaded pain , hated blood . Would someone interrupt this ceremony -- or worse , discover her secret , forbidden liaison ? Dangerous intrigues shadowed her life , and there were people who might wish to see her disgraced and banished from the castle . But love demanded sacrifice and necessitated risk . With unsteady hands she poured sake into the two cups : one for herself ; a ritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swallowed the drink . Her eyes watered ; her throat burned . But the potent liquor enflamed her courage and determination . She picked up the razor . With careful strokes Harume shaved bare her pubic area , brushing the cut black strands onto the floor . Then she set aside the razor and lifted the knife . Reiko , her face still concealed beneath the white headdress , lifted the sake cup to her lips and drank . The process was repeated three times . Then the attendants refilled the cup and passed it to Sano . He drank his three drafts , imagining that he felt the transient warmth of his bride 's dainty fingers on the polished wood and tasted the sweetness of her lip rouge on the rim : their first , albeit indirect , touch . Would their marriage be , as he hoped , a union of kindred souls as well as sensual satisfaction ? A collective sigh passed through the assembly . The san-san-ku-do --  the " three-times-three-sips " pledge that sealed the marriage bond --  never failed to arouse poignant emotion . Sano 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reiko shared his hopes . The attendant set aside the cup and filled the second one . This time Sano drank first , three times , then Reiko did . After the third , largest cup was passed and the liquor sipped , the flute and drum music resumed . Joy nearly overwhelmed Sano . He and Reiko were now joined in wedlock . Soon he would see her face again ... Touching the knife 's sharp blade to her tender , shaved skin , Harume flinched at the coldness of the steel . Her heart thudded ; her hand trembled . She put the knife down and took another drink . Then , closing her eyes , Harume summoned the image of her lover , the memory of his caresses . The incense smoke steeped her lungs in the scent of jasmine . Ardor flooded her with daring . When she opened her eyes , her body was still , her mind calm . She took up the knife again . On her pubis she slowly cut the first stroke , just above the cleft of her womanhood . Crimson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain ; tears stung her eyes . But she wiped away the blood with the end of her sash , took another drink , and cut the next stroke . More pain ; more blood . Eleven more strokes , and Harume sighed in relief . The worst part was done . Now for the step that would bind her irrevocably to her lover . Harume opened the lacquer jar . The stopper was fitted with a bamboo-handled brush , its soft bristles saturated with gleaming black ink . Carefully she brushed the ink onto the cuts , enjoying its cool wetness , balm to her pain . With her bloody sash she blotted up the excess ink and stoppered the bottle . Then , sipping more sake , she admired her work . The complete tattoo , the size of her thumbnail , etched in black lines , now adorned her private place : an indelible expression of fidelity and devotion . Until the hair grew back , she hoped she could keep herself covered , hiding her secret from the other concubines , the palace officials , the shogun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would know it was there . As would he . They would treasure this symbol of the only marriage they would ever celebrate . Harume poured herself another cup of sake , a private toast to eternal love . But when she drank , she could n't swallow ; the sake leaked from her mouth , running down her chin . A strange tingling began in Harume 's lips and tongue ; her throat felt strangely thick and numb , as if packed with cotton . An eerie , cold sensation crept across her skin . Dizziness washed over her . The room spun ; the lamp flames , unnaturally bright , whirled before her eyes . Frightened , she dropped the cup . What was happening to her ? Sudden nausea gripped Harume . Doubling over , hands pressed against her stomach , she retched . Hot , sour vomit clogged her throat , shot up her nose , and spewed onto the floor . She wheezed and coughed , unable to get enough air . In a panic , Harume rose and started for the door . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumbled , scattering incense burners , razor , knife , and ink bottle . Lurching and limping , all the while struggling to breathe , Harume managed to reach the door and open it . A hoarse cry burst from her numb lips . " Help ! " The corridor was empty . Clutching her throat , Harume staggered in the direction of voices that sounded distorted and far away . Ceiling lanterns burned as bright as suns , blinding her . She grabbed the walls for support . Through a haze of dizzy nausea , Harume saw winged black shapes pursuing her . Claws snatched at her hair . High-pitched shrieks echoed in her ears . Demons ! Now the attendants served sake to Sano 's mother and Magistrate Ueda , honoring the new allegiance between the two families , then passed cups of liquor to the assembly , which proclaimed in unison , " Omedeto **26;0;TOOLONG ! " Sano saw happy faces turned toward him and Reiko . His mother 's loving gaze warmed him . Hirata passed a self-conscious hand over the black stubble on his head -- shaved during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignified approval ; the shogun grinned . From the table before him , Sano picked up the ceremonial document and read in an unsteady voice , " We have now become united as husband and wife for all eternity . We vow to execute our marital duties faithfully and spend all the days of our lives together in never-ending trust and affection . Sano Ichiro , the twentieth day of the ninth month , Genroku year three . " Then Reiko read from her identical document . Her voice was high , clear , and melodic . This was the first time Sano had ever heard it . What would they talk about , alone together , tonight ? The attendants handed Sano and Reiko branches of saka tree with white paper strips attached , leading the couple to the alcove to make a traditional wedding offering to the gods . Small and slender , Reiko barely came up to Sano 's shoulder . Her long sleeves and hem trailed on the floor . Together they bowed and laid the branches on the altar . The attendants bowed twice to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed suit . " The ceremony is successfully completed , " announced the priest who had performed the invocation . " Now the bride and groom can begin to build a harmonious home . " Pursued by the demons , Harume somehow found her way through the winding passages of the women 's quarters , to the door leading to the main palace . There stood the castle ladies , dressed in bright , colorful kimonos , attended by servants and a few male guards . Harume 's strength was fading . Wheezing and choking , she crashed to the floor . In a loud rustle of silk garments , the crowd turned . A flurry of exclamations arose : " It 's Lady Harume ! " " What 's wrong with her ? " " There 's blood all over her mouth ! " Now a shifting collage of shocked , frightened faces hovered over Harume . Ugly purple blotches obscured the familiar features of these women she knew . Noses elongated ; eyes burned ; fanged mouths leered . Black wings sprouted from shoulders , fanning the air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claws reached out to grab . " Demons , " Harume gasped . " Do n't come any closer . No ! " Strong hands seized her . Authoritative male voices gave orders . " She 's ill . Get a doctor . " " Do n't let her disrupt the sosakan-sama 's wedding . " " Take her to her room . " Panic infused strength into Harume 's muscles . As she kicked and thrashed and gasped for breath , her voice burst from her in a scream of terror : " Help ! Demons ! Do n't let them kill me ! " " She 's mad . Stay back -- out of the way ! She 's violent . " Down the corridor they carried her , trailed by the screeching , flapping horde . Harume struggled to free herself . Her captors finally set her down , pinning her arms and legs . She was trapped . The demons would rip her to shreds , then devour her . Yet even as these fearsome thoughts flashed through Harume 's mind , a more terrifying power gathered within her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and nerve ; stretched sinews ; drew invisible chains tight around internal organs . Harume screamed in agony as her back arched and her stiff limbs shot out . In a cacophony of shrieks , the demons let go , thrown off by the force of her involuntary movements . A second , stronger convulsion , and darkness seeped across her vision . External sensations receded ; she could n't see the demons or hear their voices . The wild , erratic pounding of her own heart filled her ears . Another convulsion . Mouth open wide , Harume could n't draw another breath . Her final thought was of her lover : With a grief as agonizing as the pain , she knew she would never see him again in this life . Then one last gasp . One more unspoken plea : Help ... Then nothingness . Sano barely heard the assembly 's murmured blessings , because the attendants were lifting the white drape away from his new wife 's head . She was turning toward him ... Looking even younger than her twenty years , Reiko had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her eyes , like bright , black flower petals , shone with somber innocence . On her high , shaved brow arched the fine lines of painted eyebrows . White rice powder covered smooth , perfect skin , contrasting with the satiny black hair that fell from a center part all the way to her knees . Her beauty took Sano 's breath away . Then Reiko smiled at him -- the merest shy curving of dainty red lips before she demurely lowered her gaze . Sano 's heart clenched with a fierce , possessive tenderness as he smiled back . She was everything he wanted . Their life together would be sheer conjugal bliss , which would begin as soon as the public formalities ended . The assembly stood as the attendants escorted Sano and Reiko from the altar to their families . Sano bowed to Magistrate Ueda and thanked him for the honor of joining the clan , while Reiko did the same to Sano 's mother . Together they thanked the shogun for his patronage , and the guests for coming . Then , after many more congratulations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shogun , moved through the carved doors and down the wide corridor toward the hall where the wedding banquet would take place and more guests waited . Suddenly , from deep within the castle 's interior , came loud , high- pitched screams , then the sound of running footsteps . The shogun paused , halting the procession . " What is that noise ? " he asked , his aristocratic features darkening in annoyance . To his officials , he said , " Go and , ahh , determine the cause , and put a stop to --  " Down the corridor toward the wedding party stampeded hundreds of shrieking women , some dressed in brilliant silk robes , others wearing the plain cotton kimonos of servants , all holding their sleeves over their noses and mouths , eyes wide with terror . Palace officials stormed after them , shouting commands and trying to restore order , but the women paid no heed . " Let us out ! " they cried , shoving the bridal procession up against the wall as they rushed past . " How dare these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tsunayoshi wailed . " Has everyone gone mad ? Guards -- stop them ! " Magistrate Ueda and the attendants shielded Reiko from the mob , which quickly expanded to include panicky guests pouring out of the banquet hall . They crashed into Sano 's mother ; he caught her before she fell . " We 're all doomed if we do n't run ! " shrilled the women . Now an army of guards appeared . They herded the hysterical women back to the castle interior . The wedding party and guests clustered in the banquet hall , where tables and cushions had been arranged on the floor , a troupe of frightened musicians clutched their instruments , and maids waited to serve the feast . " What is the meaning of this ? " The shogun straightened his tall black cap , knocked atilt in the scuffle . " I , ahh , demand an explanation ! " The guard commander bowed to Tokugawa Tsunayoshi . " My apologies , Your Excellency , but there 's been a disturbance in the women 's quarters . Your concubine Lady Harume just died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark blue coat of his profession , added , " Her death was caused by a sudden violent illness . The other ladies fled in panic , fearing contagion . " Murmurs of dismay rose from the assembly . Tokugawa Tsunayoshi gasped . " Contagion ? " His face paled , and he covered his nose and mouth with both hands to keep the spirit of disease from entering . " Do you mean to say there is an , ahh , epidemic in the castle ? " A dictator of delicate health and with little talent for leadership , he turned to Sano and Magistrate Ueda , the men present who ranked next below him in status . " What is to be done ? " " The nuptial festivities must be canceled , " Magistrate Ueda said with regret , " and the guests sent home . I will see to the arrangements . " Sano , though shocked by this calamitous end to his wedding , hastened to his lord 's aid . Contagious disease was a serious concern in Edo Castle , which housed hundreds of Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there really is an epidemic , the ladies must be quarantined to prevent its spread . " Sano instructed the guard commander to manage this , and told the castle physician to examine the women for symptoms . " And you , Your Excellency , should stay in your chambers to avoid illness . " " Ahh , yes , of course , " said Tokugawa Tsunayoshi , obviously relieved to have someone else take charge . Hurrying in the direction of his private suite , the shogun summoned the officials to follow , while shouting orders to Sano : " You must personally investigate Lady Harume 's death at once ! " In his fear for himself , he seemed indifferent to the loss of his concubine and the fate of his other women . And he 'd apparently forgotten all about Sano 's promised holiday . " You must prevent the evil spirit of disease from reaching me . Now go ! " " Yes , Your Excellency , " Sano called after the retreating despot and his entourage . Hirata hurried to join him . As they started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked over his shoulder and saw Reiko , white bridal gown trailing behind her , being escorted out by her father and attendants . He felt extreme annoyance at the shogun for reneging on his promise , and regret for the delayed wedding celebrations , both public and private . Had he not earned a little peace and happiness ? Then Sano suppressed a sigh . Obedience to his lord was a samurai 's highest virtue . Duty prevailed ; once again , death commanded Sano 's attentions . Marital bliss would have to wait .
