From A Great Improvisation : // Typically after an ocean crossing Franklin 's eyes brimmed with tears at the sight of land ; he had just withstood the most brutal voyage of his life . For thirty days he had pitched about violently on the wintry Atlantic , in a cramped cabin and under unremittingly dark skies . He was left with barely the strength to stand , but was to cause a sensation . Even his enemies conceded that he touched down in France like a meteor . Among American arrivals , only Charles Lindbergh could be said to have met with equal rapture , the difference being that Lindbergh was not a celebrity until he landed in Paris . At the time he set foot on French soil Benjamin Franklin was among the most famous men in the world . It was his country that was the great unknown . America was six months old ; Franklin seventy years her senior . And the fate of that infant republic was , to a significant extent , in his hands . //      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
