MILLARD WAS OUT BACK PRACTICING . He had hung his homemade " Gone Plinking " sign on the doorknob of the Swap Shop and was sitting on a sweetgum stump loading the tubes for his Ruger . It was a cheap piece of artillery , but the pump action allowed him to work fast with .22 shorts and keep any bystanders bedazzled . Rudeen had given up trying to keep him inside the shop on a sunny day , in spite of the way he enjoyed the restoration part of the job . His carnival years long behind him , he was still a local attraction , and he liked to stay sharp . " He 's bad as a preacher , " she 'd say , " who 's always got to be showing how saved he is . I reckon that 's why he favors the kneeling position . " She 'd laugh her men-are-so-dopey laugh . <p> A company in Kentucky sold cards by the pound , all aces so you did n't have to buy regular decks and waste most of them . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the mud barrow , then stroll back and pick up the rifle , which was akin to a toy in his humongous hands . Brow sweat would sparkle on a day like this , and he 'd take a couple minutes to get his breathing right . <p> When Jimmy Nichols came around the corner , he could already hear it : The Ruger spat and spat , the rimfire shells sounding like the sharp slap of fingers across a cupped palm . Shucking the slide without unsquinting , Millard shot fast enough that it resembled a measured and steady applause . He had popsicle sticks tacked to a two-by-four , and he split every one . He had red-dot targets you could obliterate with three or four shots so the paper never showed a trace of the dye . He did it in three . If he worked half an hour , he 'd attract a row of local autodidacts smoking Camels and speculating on whether he had 20-10 vision or could sniff the heart of a target . . . or maybe had made some dark bargain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting started that Wednesday , popping the centers out of the aces , shooting alone for his own pleasure and that of God ( who was , he liked to say , a qualified referee ) . <p> " You sumbitch , " Jimmy called , and Millard turned , his gun catching the April sun . Jimmy shaded his eyes with his hand , like he was half saluting . " You sumbitch . " <p> They had been running mates since before they were tall as tractor tires . They 'd married the sisters-Lurleen and Rudeen-pretty much on a lark . But the Swap Shop had come between them , and then the turkey shoots . No matter how hard Jimmy tried , he could not best Millard at sharpshooting . It was always close-a point here , another there  --  so it got to be a rivalry , then a feud . The blood ran hot at times , in a friendly way , and they 'd take up different corners at Jamboree Juke or a Legion Post social , spinning yarns on each other about as harmless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other beard to beard in the two years since Millard caught Jimmy fiddling with the firing pin of the bolt-action Marlin he saved for the regional big-bore shoots . At least that was what Millard was sure Jimmy Nichols was working at . <p> " You sumbitch . " Jimmy was moving faster now , not just walking but not quite at a run . Millard still wore the same puzzled look , as if bipedal velocity was the complication he was least prepared for , as if Jimmy 's voice had come back from some mythic land of mutehood . He could see that Jimmy was peeling off his wire-rims , stuffing them into his shirt pocket . Jimmy 's face shone like a pickled beet . <p> It was about Lurleen , of course . She was the one who inherited the Cup ' N ' Sup , which was a sight more elegant to operate than the Swap Shop . She was the one who held the Mary Kay parties and got the school board to forbid the teaching of the Harry Potter wizard books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd been split in the front with an ax . Lipstick the color of Naked Mountain merlot , fake fingernails curled like the talons of an owl . Even the geriatrics ogled her . <p> And folks told it she was sweet on her husband 's boyhood blood  --  brother . Rumor had it . . . well , it was a known fact Millard had been a sport when he was younger , but the fresh rumor was that she wanted to get back at Rudeen , because uppity as the restaurant business was , she was n't raking in the cash like her younger sister . Because what Millard added to the Swap Shop was more than just being a handyman : He was an old-fashioned joiner , a true craftsman , some said an artist . In the evening or on days when rain plonked the shop 's tin roof , he 'd be at his bench under the bright work-lights with a saw or drawknife , shaving rough spots off somebody 's chifforobe , inscribing flower petals on a consignment vanity , pulling the bow out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ razor and the oils and knew just how deep to sand when restoring an antique piece . He preferred to conduct his expertise in private , but it was known that he was a saint of the bevel and auger , the rasp and router . He could peg and pin , dovetail and mortise , and when he used nails at all-brads really-they were so fine that nobody could imagine how he could feel them in his huge hands . But everybody knew he could feel a trigger , could squeeze it so secretly and absorb the kick so well that only the crack of the powder and the jumping of some target downrange let anyone know he 'd shot at all . <p> The story had it that Lurleen found him under the swag light , scent of the rosin in the scattered sawdust sharpened by the heat of the bulb , his face backlit in that same light-haloed , you might say . Rudeen was over to Macon on a buying trip , not due back till the late news . Millard was redeeming an Edwardian sofa for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvet-and-mahogany pieces that you knew had to be purple and that only a prude librarian or an orangutan could find comfort on . He had disappeared the dings with polymer and brought the finish back up with hand-sanding and stain . He was just completing the tapping in of the thousand or so breast-headed upholsterer 's tacks when his sister  --  in-law appeared with the oldest mischief on her mind . <p> Theories about the specifics have since abounded , and even one detail of her couture or jewelry , his footwear or string tie or where the clock 's arrows aimed , any smidgen of evidence at all was considered a pearl of great price in gossip parlors by the time talk grew general after Jimmy spoke to Millard for that first time in nearly two years . <p> Because , of course , Jimmy killed him . Shot him in the forehead , dead center , with a war-surplus .45 Browning , and Millard standing there with his plinking rifle in his hands . His empty plinking rifle , " not much more than a plaything , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his glasses just before showing the weapon did puzzle everybody , but it was only his own testimony that brought that business into the case . Rudeen heard the shot and knew it was different , was not Millard popping bottle caps at thirty feet or cutting the edges off the lid of a soup can . <p> It 's hard to say what will cause a man to snap . It 's prone to happen in the spring , when the gusty wind carries the paper mill 's chemical stink along the river and into town . Jimmy 's lawyer opened by advancing another theory , the surprise of the trial . Sweetgum balls . They littered the yard like some ninja 's play pretties , and it was just possible , barely possible Jimmy could 've slid on one or two and lost his footing , possible he tripped and skidded and never aimed his equalizer pistol at all but just squeezed off a round as a reflex when his body tensed . Lawyer Fenster , the most Elmer Fudd-looking man you will ever see , allowed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scare . And he had a right to protect the sanctity of his marriage vows , after all . A weakness in all this , worm in the apple so to speak , was the beauty of the shot . It went in sop clean and hot that nothing came out the front at all , not so much as an ooze . Of course , the exit wound-the sheriff called it that-in back did more than just part Millard 's hair against the crown . What went in was no target load ; what came out was a world . <p> I ca n't resist thinking of that last night at the Lessups ' : Rudeen already sawing logs in her French Provincial twin , Millard at the window with the glass of peach brandy he allowed himself every night since his . mother died . He 'd looked after her , even when he was in the carnival " living over the wheels , " as he 'd say . He 'd send money ; he 'd catch a ride back from Galax or Monroeville or Opp . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Miz Lessup cashed in . Millard , no small man , was perched atop the kitchen counter , still in his funeral suit like some overgrown crow , and he had an awful voice , singing snippets of " Will the Circle Be Unbroken " over and again , changing the order , just moaning where he could n't get the words to lock in . Then " to take my poor mother away " would come round again , and he 'd sob , those heavy shoulders heaving , fingers gripping his temples like he was trying to force himself not to know . <p> So that last night before he died , Mill must 've been savoring his snifter , looking out the window at the weird frenzy of the forsythia and the first real display of the Bradford pears , which would 've looked ghostly and proud under the big moon . It was waning , just slightly after full . Still nearly round . Or he might have been watching the radio dials glow while he listened to oldies . He might have been going over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost never used the silhouette targets , but that day Sammy Poole had seen him hanging them on the pulley line . Some would tease a meaning out of that-Jimmy 's lawyer , for instance , stroking his dome and asking the jury , " What was that Millard up to ? " <p> He might have had the window open for the camellia smell . He liked to savor things . He was in the Masons and wore several of those symbol rings . He had a collection of antique tools-telescoping levels and fold-up rulers , wee bitty pliers made of brass . He liked to hold them up to the light , to feel in his fingers the exact nature of things , hinge and gear , calibration and sweet edge . <p> But he could also have been in the basement reloading shells . He did n't believe in waste . He had a bench with loaders , bins of shells , crimpers , wadding , sacks of powder ( a mix he concocted from a book ) . He knew a fellow in Tallahassee who was running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pills just to get it up . Millard did n't trust that , thought it might hex the bullets , so he made his own . Hardly anybody believes he 'd go for Lurleen 's sashay and shimmydimmydoo , no matter what spangle or sweet nothings she 'd come up with . I saw him once pulling whistlepig spines out of a stray redbone hound , keeping him calm and holding him off from snapping while the spears came out . You could see he valued what he could do with his hands . Some things you ca n't believe he 'd touch . <p> Lurleen , now she 's always been a piece of work , always in a dance to music nobody else can hear . It like to made Jimmy crazy , that and his tiny , guaranteed flinch when the chips were down . Given the right encouragement , the man could screw up a free pass to Beulah Land . It was like a stutter in the nerves , but he was a fairly peaceful creature all the same . Usually . He 'd learned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent just enough time over a hot stove to relish that bumper sticker : " Work is for men who do n't know how to fish . " The general opinion is that he was not devoted to the body for other than the culinary . That system of arranging your life does not guarantee a blissful partnership . And Lurleen , well , she surely was a looker , and you had to reckon she had hungers of her own . <p> He sat vigil , cuffed to a deputy , with the body formerly Millard , and he wept . He talked to the body , private-like . Sometimes you could catch that he was trying to discuss ballistic stunts-the mirror shots , round-the-bend . In two-birds ( he 'd been known to tell this one when he 'd had a couple longnecks ) , you split your lead on an ax-blade to break two bottles at once . It was a cinch if you got your windage right . Then he 'd commence to crying again or lean his ear toward Millard 's mouth , like he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but might have a final word of advice . <p> What they came up with , the twelve gentlemen tried and true ( though three were women ) , was a mix of temporary insanity and self  --  defense , followed by the anticlimax of probationary observation by a shrink , but right after the verdict Lurleen , who 'd put on the dog for the trial , dolled up in black silk and a veil , her nails bright as cardinal crests , lit a skinny cigarette , turned to a weeping Rudeen , and said , " Sister , we done lost the hottest man we ever had . " And then she smiled . <p> Nobody , least of all Lurleen Nichols , seemed to know Rudeen could shoot , let alone that she carried a chunky little Smith nine  --  millimeter in her bag . Looking into the dark , round , empty eye of that thing , Lurleen was the first on God 's green earth to find it out , and nobody will ever know if she had time to be impressed . What happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very day and why there 's a flower cross beside the courthouse steps and why everybody knows the governor of our great state , who is strong for the NRA but weak on snuffing a woman , has tossed between his satiny sheets three nights running without getting so much as a wink . <p>
