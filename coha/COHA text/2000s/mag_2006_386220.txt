Prince George 's County in Maryland , with its bucolic setting , palatial homes and expensive cars in the driveway , in many ways is a barometer of Black success . But residents say there 's trouble in paradise . ESSENCE investigates why the nation 's most prosperous Black community has such a high rate of domestic violence reports-and why sisters are suffering in silence BY RENE GRAHAM PHOTOGRAPHY BY BOB CAREY // By the time police arrived at the elegant entranceway of the spacious four-bedroom home she shared with her husband , Belina Wimbish was ready to tell a lie . She could n't bring herself to admit that earlier that night her husband had pinned her to the wall with such a ferocious grip around her neck that her feet dangled above the floor . Wimbish , an engineer , now says she worried that the secret cycle of abuse she had endured for years would be revealed , and the faade of what seemed an enviable life would be shattered . " People used to say our house should be in Better Homes and Gardens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadness . " Everyone thought we were the perfect couple . " Her story echoes the one related by Veronica Ginyard , who said she also endured abuse . Ginyard , who is a 46-year-old mother of eight , also spent years hiding in plain sight , never admitting to her family the incidents of abuse she says she suffered during her 13-year marriage . The whole thing appeared to be beautiful , but the undertone was dark and ugly , recalls Ginyard . " On the outside I was smiling , but on the inside as soon as we hit the doorway , all he had suppressed during the day would come flying out , " she says . Welcome to Prince George 's County , the Maryland enclave that , according to U.S. Census data , is the nation 's richest predominantly African-American county . In communities like Bowie and University Park , affluence abounds , from the McMansions and well-manicured properties to the luxury cars that line practically every driveway . These outward signs of wealth add luster to the county 's well-heeled image . But Prince George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shiny surface . As of last June , there had been nine domestic abuse-related deaths in the county , two more than the previous year . And since 2001 , according to the Maryland Network Against Domestic Violence , 48 people , mostly women , have died there as a result of domestic violence , second only to Baltimore County , which suffered 72 deaths . An American Nightmare One particularly shocking case of brutality in Prince George 's County recently garnered national attention . Last April , Roger Hargrave was convicted on various counts , including first-degree attempted murder , for setting his now ex-wife Yvette Cade on fire as coworkers watched in horror ( see " A Survivor 's Tale " on page 220 ) . Cade survived but sustained burns on 60 percent of her body . And last June , police believe 38-year-old Richard E. Sperling , Jr. , of Prince George 's County shot and killed his wife , a University of Maryland graduate and government financial analyst , and then turned the gun on himself . The woman 's father told the Washington Post that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another Prince George 's County man doused his girlfriend with gasoline and set her afire , like Cade , she survived . Wimbish says she once believed that education , income and the right address would inoculate her from the horrors of the violent behavior she witnessed as a child . " This had happened to my mother ; this had happened to my stepmother . This was not supposed to happen to me , " Wimbish , 38 , now says . " I got out of Seat Pleasant , which is a low-income area in Prince George 's County . I got my engineering degree , and I got my career . I did all the right things , and this was not supposed to be my life . " As in so many communities , there are no simple reasons for the causes of domestic violence . Substance abuse , the mounting stresses of personal and professional lives , coupled with archaic notions of male dominance within a patriarchal society are often cited by experts as common factors . Still , here there seems to be the added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities where lives are meticulously designed to be admired and envied . In such a community , some families-perhaps in a misguided attempt to keep up with the neighbors-live beyond their means , exacerbating marital discord . And , among African-Americans , there 's also the stubborn adage of keeping a community 's business within the community , allowing social problems to fester . Secrets and Lies The rate of domestic abuse claims is so high in this community that last year more than 14,598 orders of protection were handed out , nearly twice the number as in 2000 . While the case of Yvette Cade has focused more attention on the problem , Glenn F. Ivey , the state 's attorney for the county and coprosecutor in the Hargrave case , says its lasting effect remains to be seen : " The jury is still out . " Much of the clandestine violence can be attributed to the code of silence that seems to surround this phenomenon . Veronica Ginyard says she was so embarrassed about the abuse she endured that she avoided her family rather than seek their help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ashamed , " she admits . But Ginyard 's family could sense a level of disharmony within the marriage . " We would go over to her house , and there was never a setting where she was happy . And shewould wear dark glasses , so I said , " Something 's wrong , " " says Valeria Baylor , Ginyard 's sister . " I knew something was n't right in that relationship , and my dad , who 's dead now , knew it , too . He 'd say , " That man 's hitting her . I know it ; I can feel it . ' Baylor 's fears were later confirmed when Ginyard called the police to her Hyattsville home , then contacted her sister , who took her to the hospital . " I told her I would 've gotten a pot of grits and burned the poopy out of him or tried to cut his penis off-one or the other , " Baylor says without a hint of humor in her voice . Ginyard says the abuse began when she and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still newlyweds . " I 'm not from a background of abuse , so as it was happening , I did n't recognize it as being abuse , " she says . " I thought , Hmmm , he 's having a bad day ; that 's why he just called me a bitch . " Then one night during a heated argument , the verbal abuse became physical . Ginyard , hoping to avoid a violent episode , left the family home , seeking sanctuary with a friend . When the two women returned to Ginyard 's house , her husband was hiding in the backseat of their car parked in the driveway . As Ginyard passed , he suddenly jumped out and punched her in the mouth . " It was horrible ; my lip was split open , " she recalls . " That was the worst . Before that it was only pushing and stuff . " Ginyard 's friend defended her , and the two women sped off , only to be pursued by Ginyard 's husband . Fearing more for her friend 's safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car . She then stepped into the car with her husband , who drove to a remote , secluded area off the parkway . With the taste of blood in her mouth , Ginyard prepared to die . " It was like an out-of-body experience , " she says . She survived that night , which ended with a lot of screaming and shoving . But this would n't be the last time Ginyard would fear death . Even during her pregnancies , she maintains , the abuse continued . " He threw me down the stairs . He sat on me and twisted my knee . There was a time when I was lying on the floor bleeding profusely from the side of my head . I called the police a couple of times , but then I 'd tell them to go away , " she explains . " Until you 're ready to leave , you do n't want the police involved because you know you 're going to get hurt later . He once told me , " If I get arrested , I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband 's abuse began before they even married , and over the silliest thing . " He just lashed out at me , " she says , " and he called me a bitch and a whore . " Wimbish still became his wife , and she says the abuse continued . Lauree Covington , a friend of Wimbish 's for nearly a decade , witnessed the marriage 's disintegration while living with the couple . When Wimbish was recovering from a major slip and fall , her husband " just did n't attend to her . She would be racked with pain and would be unable to move or do anything , and he would be downstairs playing video games . " Months later things escalated when Covington heard her friend 's screams in an upstairs bedroom . " He was on top of her . He was n't hitting her , but he had her pinned to the bed . I went to push him off , but when he saw me , he backed off . " Yet when Wimbish decided to call the police , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispatcher could answer . " I 'm not trying to justify what happened between the two of them ; I just did n't want to see him go to jail , " Covington contends . Unable to leave her marriage and unwilling to have him arrested , Wimbish would spend nine tumultuous years with her husband before divorcing him in 2004 . Breaking the Silence Women stay in abusive relationships for reasons hard to fathom by those who 've never endured such a situation . And leaving an abuser has never guaranteed safety . In 2003 , Ernestine Bunn-Dyson of Oxon Hill was shot to death by her estranged husband , who then turned the gun on himself . That tragedy , state 's attorney Ivey says , prompted the creation of Project Safe Sunday , which encourages church leaders to speak to their flocks about domestic violence and offer information on help that 's available . With more than 800 churches in Prince George 's County , including several megachurches with congregations of at least 10,000 , Ivey saw a potentially great network for reaching a large number of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handful of churches participating . " I got private calls from ministers saying , " It 's too hot ; it 's too controversial . We ca n't touch it , ' " Ivey recalls . Asked why church leaders may be reticent , Ivey refers to Ephesians 5:22-24 . In those passages wives are told to " submit to your husbands as you do the Lord " and " to submit to your husbands in everything . " " The interpretation by some people has been , I think , passively condoning some degree of physical force , " Ivey believes . " They wo n't say that , but I do n't see any other reason they would be so reluctant to talk about the issue . But when I go to these churches and I start talking about domestic violence , the heads are always nodding , and you get the amens and everything . And it 's not because I 'm the next Jesse Jackson when it comes to preaching . It 's because the message resonates with them . " The Reverend Sherry Davis Molock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first churches to embrace Project Safe Sunday . Molock , who is also a clinical psychologist and an associate professor of psychology at George Washington University , says reaching a desirable level of professional achievement may make some victims less likely to acknowledge difficulties in their personal relationships . " I think Black people are reluctant to talk publicly about problems , especially middle-class Black people , because there 's this sense that we 've made it . That may make women reluctant to risk having a squad car outside their door . There 's a lot of shame involved . " That 's why Ginyard says she chose to present a public face as the ideal , stable , loving African-American family riding in their 15-passenger van to picnics and outings . " I thought I was bringing shame on my family . And especially being African-American , I always believed , We wo n't be another statistic , another family that broke up . That played an important part in my decision to stay . " She eventually sought support from the House of Ruth , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sexual violence . Given its high rate of domestic violence , Prince George 's County has begun to focus more attention-and funding-on improving services for victims , says Norma Harley , manager of the domestic violence intervention , community services and victim advocate units for the Office of the Sheriff in Prince George 's County . Earlier this year , the sheriff 's office received a $6,000 grant from the Verizon Wireless HopeLine program for the purchase of digital cameras for all domestic violence units . There was also a donation of 100 cell phones , preprogrammed for 3,000 minutes for clients on an as-needed basis . Located in the county 's District III , Capitol Heights is one of the areas participating in a new anti-domestic violence pilot program launched by the county Office of the Sheriff , which now handles all the district 's domestic violence cases instead of the county police , Harley says . " Because we have such a strong focus on domestic issues , we wanted to centralize domestic violence issues in this agency and to be with the victim through the process , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survivors , such as Yvette Cade , can also play a vital role in reaching out to other victims . That belief spurred Wimbish , who is now a minister , to create Belina Ministries and the No More Silence Domestic Violence Project . " I call it No More Silence because I think there are many women out there like me , who may have a nice income , who seem to have so much to lose and are suffering in silence , " she says . " We have to free women from the shame that keeps them in these relationships .
