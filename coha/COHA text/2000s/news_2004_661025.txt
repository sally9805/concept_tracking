<p> When the US earmarked billions of dollars for a new national missile defense and broke ground in Alaska , Washington emphasized that it would be " no threat to Russia . " <p> Then , with the inevitability of a cold-war counterpunch , President Vladimir Putin saw fit to reassure Russians that America 's shield could be defeated , with a silver bullet successfully tested in February . <p> " No country in the world as yet has such arms , " Putin declared of the new weapon , which amounts to a space cruise missile . It will be " capable of hitting targets continents away with hypersonic speed , high precision , and the ability of wide maneuver . " <p> Welcome back to the future of US-Russian rivalry . Analysts say that a combination of US military efforts - including missile defense , plans for new low-yield nuclear weapons , and expansion up to Russia 's western doorstep - are chilling relations with Moscow and spurring a new , higher-tech arms race . <p> Despite American declarations of goodwill , Russian interpretations of US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivalry , and a current fear of being left behind . A strategy rethink is under way in Moscow . Senior officers speak of an " asymmetrical " response to counter US strength without matching Washington 's expenditures . <p> " I understand America 's measures as a continuation of the arms race , " says Viktor Baranets , military columnist for the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper . " With our slim budget we are making an effort to catch up with the rich American chariot . " <p> " They think that we 're kind of crazy to be pursuing missile defense , " says Marshall Goldman , of the Davis Center for Russian Studies at Harvard . " It is just another example in their minds of how the US is still fighting the cold war . " <p> And missile defense is not the only issue . <p> Work by the US on new types of nuclear weapons helped prompt the largest Russian military exercises since the Soviet era earlier this year . Russia is especially alert to the " possible reemergence of nuclear weapons as a real military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous tendency that is undermining global and regional stability , " Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov wrote in the journal Russia in Global Politics . " Even a minor reduction in the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons would require Russia to revise ... the use of its units . " <p> Mr. Ivanov also warned in March that if " anti-Russian elements " persist in any NATO " offensive military doctrine , Russia will have to adequately revise its military planning ... including its nuclear forces . " In April , four Belgian F-16 fighter jets deployed to Lithuania to patrol the alliance 's new shared border with Russia . The move prompted sharp criticism from Moscow of an imminent " collision . " <p> Keeping up with GI Jones <p> Moscow is also trying to figure out how to at least keep up with America 's growing military resources . In recent years , Russia has moved to extend the service life of its multiwarhead SS-18 and SS-19 intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) , and purchased 30 like-new SS-19s from Ukraine . Last year , Putin said of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penetrating through any missile defense , is without peer . " <p> Though these ICBMs are a critical component of Russia 's strategic nuclear forces , they do n't always work . Test launches in February , intended to be the highlight of Russia 's intense military exercises failed , despite the presence of Mr. Putin - smartly attired in Naval uniform - on the deck of a nearby submarine . <p> To the acute embarrassment of the Russian General Staff , two sub-launched missiles never left their launch tubes . A third ICBM , fired the next day , veered off course after 98 seconds of flight and self-destructed . <p> However , Putin 's new " secret " weapon can ride atop the relatively new , three-stage SS-27 missile , known as the Topol-M . Experts say the weapon is a maneuverable warhead that can dart unpredictably at high speeds as it reenters the atmosphere , making it virtually impossible to target at that stage . It is essentially a space cruise missile , born from Soviet efforts to penetrate Ronald Reagan 's " Star Wars " missile shield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to tell if the breakthrough would have been possible without concern for US missile defense , " says Pavel Podvig at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology . " Missile defense has no real military value ... but at the same time , it has very serious political value . Missile defense is not such a serious issue that it drives us back into the cold war , but it makes dismantling that system much more difficult . " <p> Russian unease may also erode support for Washington 's war on terror . <p> " It might lead to our relations becoming cooler instead of united in our effort to oppose common threats from terrorism , " says columnist Baranets . " Should the US and Russia go on building more warplanes , missiles , and subs just because our brains have n't been cleaned from the cold war dirt ? Or should we jointly protect ourselves from stones somebody might throw our way ? " <p> Still , since Sept. 11 , 2001 , Russia cast itself as a fellow terror fighter , side by side with Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Anti-Ballistic Missile ( ABM ) treaty in June 2002 . The treaty forbade deployment of a missile defense network . The US has since began work in Alaska for an initial 10 interceptor missiles , meant to stop a single missile from a " rogue " state like North Korea . <p> " It 's US taxpayers ' money , so if they want to waste it , Russia should not involve herself explaining to Americans why missile defense is not worth it , " says Vladimir Orlov , director of the Center for Policy Studies in Moscow . <p> Exploiting the shield ' threat ' <p> Indeed , the controversies in the US that are swirling around the system have not gone unnoticed in Russia . Though a limited system is due to go online later this year , the Pentagon 's top weapons tester told Congress in March that operational testing was not planned " for the foreseeable future , " and that he could not be sure the system would work against a North Korean missile . <p> The General Accounting Office has found that only two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proven to be workable . In light of that - and far greater concern about terrorism - 49 retired US generals and admirals wrote to President Bush in late March suggesting delaying deployment . <p> " The Russian military and scientists understand that US missile defense is a joke , but that does n't mean that everybody understands that - it 's a political environment , " says Theodore Postol , a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . <p> " If I wave a plastic gun in front of the police , when they are nervous and they think I 'm a terrorist , I 'm going to get shot , though the gun has no capability , " adds Mr. Postol . " That 's the game the Bush administration has been playing , with extremely negative consequences for the US . " <p> Some here quietly welcome those consequences . " Russia is thinking : Should it really oppose new US weapons , or use them as an excuse to follow the same path ? " says Ivan Safranchuk , head of the Moscow office of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense industry , the US moves are a potential boon . <p> " This gives the bombmakers an ... opportunity to revive programs that were actively pursued in the 1980s , " says Pavel Felgenhauer , an independent defense analyst in Moscow . He says top Russian officials told him several years ago that plans had already been made " to resume nuclear testing , as soon as the Americans give the go ahead ... so that it will be their fault , not ours . " <p> Already , there are signs that Russia reacted offensively to US missile defense plans before they even left the drawing board . Russia launched a 2002 exercise that simulated an attack on Moscow ABM system , which experts say mirrored a strike on a future US system . <p> " We know from history that people react , nations react , and I would expect Russia to gin up its nuclear weapon R &D; programs in response , " says David Albright , head of the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington . <p> Indeed , military historians point to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late 1960s - and the exaggerated American response , which boosted the US nuclear stockpile - as a case in point . <p> According to a recent detailed analysis in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists , the CIA in 1967 estimated that Moscow 's nonhardened system was " subject to saturation and exhaustion . " Still , it was targeted with missiles from Polaris submarines and more than 100 Minuteman ICBMs - some 10 percent of all of the US ICBM force . The result was a " staggering average of eight 1-megaton warheads per interceptor launch site " with a combined force exceeding 7,500 Hiroshima bombs . Such " chilling examples ... fundamentally contradict the portrayal of missile defenses as nonoffensive " concludes the Bulletin . <p> Such hypersensitivity seemed to disappear in the post-Soviet 1990s , an era of anything-goes US-Russia contacts and joint efforts to safeguard nuclear stockpiles . But there are signs of renewed suspicion . <p> New ties feel old chill <p> Russia 's secret cities , where much nuclear and other hidden military work took place , are again clamping down . Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away state secrets . <p> Even military exchanges have chilled . For example , a Harvard program for Russian officers to learn about civilian control of the military notices the change . <p> " When the Ukrainians and other East Europeans take part , back home it is considered a leg up on their career path , " says Harvard 's Goldman , while Russians , these days , are beginning to feel the opposite . " They 've been compromised if they come , because they 've been consorting with the enemy . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
