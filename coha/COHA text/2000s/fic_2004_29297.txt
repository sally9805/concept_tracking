Indigo , Texas , was founded in 1872 by Shelton Dobbs and named in honor of his daughter , Indigo Dobbs Crockett . The prairie around Indigo , about fifty miles east of Austin , was suited to the growing of cotton , and the town soon became a banking , ginning , and shipping center for area growers . But commerce began to decline when the boll weevil destroyed the cotton , and the stores started closing during the Depression . As highways bypassed the community , its death warrant was sealed . The most recent census shows that the population has dwindled to 27 hardy souls , all of whom swear that they would rather die in Indigo than live anywhere else . " Notes on Some Notable Texas Towns , " The Enterprise , Pecan Springs , Texas The man died fast and hard and in true Texas style , stepping into a shotgun blast that lifted his feet off the ground and slammed him backward through the door he 'd just opened , into the powdery dust of the street . Nobody actually saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud enough to be heard by the amateur players in a makeshift theater across the alley , just at the end of the Friday night performance of Indigo 's Blue , or Hard Times on the Blackland Prairie . The cast and most of the audience rushed out into the October night to see what had happened , followed by the San Antonio television crew that had come to shoot the performance . That 's why , on the following evening 's TV newscast , you might have seen a dead man staring blankly up at the night sky , surrounded by a crowd of wide-eyed , open-mouthed women in the long skirts and puff-sleeved shirtwaists of the 1890s , a gaudy whore in red , white , and blue spangles , and a country doctor in a frock coat and top hat , groping inexpertly for a pulse . But from the gaping hole in the victim 's chest and the amount of real blood that had soaked into the dust around the body , it was clear to the assembled crowdwhich included Mike McQuaid , Ruby Wilcox , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and phone the sheriff . But I 'm getting ahead of the story , which begins ( for me , anyway ) several days before the man opened that fatal door and ended up dead in Indigo . So I 'll start when I first learned about the problem , on a sunny Monday afternoon in early October , as I was giving Allison Selby and Ruby Wilcox the two-bit tour of my backyard garden . That 's when Allie told me about her uncle Casey and his plan to see the town of Indigo dead and buried . I live in the Texas Hill Country , in a big Victorian house on Limekiln Road with my husband , McQuaid , and our thirteen-year-old son , Brian . To get to our place , you drive south on Brazos Street past the elementary school , where you turn right onto Limekiln Road and head west about twelve miles . Slow down when you see an old shed on the right , half-smothered under a mound of enthusiastic honeysuckle , a wilding planted by a passing bird . Just past the shed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BROOK , decorated with faded bluebonnets . Turn left , and drive down the gravel lane about a quarter of a mile until it dead-ends at a two-story white Victorian with a green roof , a wrap-around porch , and a windowed turret . The house is surrounded by pecan and live oak trees and a couple of acres of grass that always needs either watering or mowing , depending on whether it 's rained lately . September had been much wetter than usual and Brian ( who is the chief lawn-mower in our family ) had spent the last couple of weekends with his mother . The grass was ankle-high , lush , and generously decorated with dandelions . " Chiggers ? " Ruby inquired dubiously , as we stood on the back porch , surveying the yard . " You bet , " I said . " Ferocious ones . I eat a lot of garlic , though , so they leave me alone . " I reached for a small bottle of the herbal bug repellent that I sell at the shop . " Chiggers hate this stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed it to her . " Want some , Allie ? " Allison shook her head . " Chiggers do n't seem to like me , " she said . " Guess I 'm just not tasty enough . " She leaned against the porch railing , gazing out across the yard . " Gosh , China , it 's so greenand lush . " I grinned . Lush was a polite way of saying that the garden had gone back to the wilderness . " It 's amazing what a little rain will do , " I said . While Ruby Wilcox is slathering on the repellent and Allison Selby is contemplating the overgrown landscape , I 'll introduce the three of us . My name is China Bayles , and I 'm the proprietor of Thyme and Seasons Herbs in Pecan Springs , a small town halfway between San Antonio and Austin , on the eastern edge of the Texas Hill Country . I came to Pecan Springs seven or eight years ago , single , approaching forty , and running from the lawfrom my career as a Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop , made friends , and settled into small-town life . Just about a year ago , I married Mike McQuaid and his son , Brian , who looks like his father , without McQuaid 's broken nose . Brian came with a pessimistic basset hound named Howard Cosell and a varying assortment of footloose and fancy-free lizards , frogs , and spiders , which are supposed to live in his bedroom but have a habit of showing up elsewhere , especially where you wish they would n't . Howard Cosell has the good taste not to eat these items of biological bric-a-brac , but he 's not above letting them think he might . Ruby Wilcox is my best friend and business partner . She 's slim and tall ( six feet two in the open-toed blue slides she was wearing today ) , with frizzed henna-red hair , a liberal smattering of sandy freckles , and a generous mouth , lips firm and full . And if her height and coloring do n't attract enough attention , she has her own uniquesome might say outlandishsense of style . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scooped-neck dress tie-dyed in various shades of indigo blue , with a matching indigo scarf twisted around her red curls , blue eyeshadow accenting her blue eyes ( she likes to wear contacts that match her outfits ) , and blue polish on her finger-and toenails . A sight to make you sit up and take notice . Ruby owns the Crystal Cave , the only New Age shop in Pecan Springsnot a surprise , for she 's fascinated by things like astrology , tarot , divination , and channeling . Right now , for instance , she 's teaching a six-week class on how to enhance your intuitionTuning in to Your Right Brain , she calls it , because the right side of the brain is the switchboard where all the intuitive connections are spliced together . When she teaches a class , Ruby does all the exercises that she asks her students to do , which means that right now , she 's working on sharpening her own intuitive skills . But the left side of Ruby 's brain works just fine , too . She 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tearoom called Thyme for Tea , located in the same building as Thyme and Seasons and the Crystal Cave . This enterprise has been a challenge since we opened a little over a year ago , but we 're finally beginning to settle into a more or less comfortable routine , with a light luncheon menu , afternoon tea , even the occasional catering job . Our shops and the tearoom are closed on Monday . That 's why the two of us could stroll around the garden this afternoon and try to fool ourselves into thinking that we 're ladies of leisure , which of course we 're not . Being self-employed has a great many advantages , but leisure is definitely not on the list . Allison Selby and I have been doing natural dye workshops together this summer . Nobody would ever call Allie pretty , for her face is too narrow , her nose too long , her chin tucked back too far into her neck . But her dark eyes flash with a vibrant electricity , her short , mahogany-colored hair is glossy , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casual self in worn jeans , scuffed leather sandals , and a T-shirt that announced the name of her business , Indigo Valley Farm . Allie lives an hour 's drive to the east and north of Pecan Springs , on beautiful Indigo Creek , near a tiny town that is also called Indigo , in Dalton County . Our workshops , which we call Colors to Dye For , take place on her farm , in her outdoor dye kitchen . I bring the dye plants and talk about them , and Allie teaches the studentssome of whom come from as far away as Dallas and Houstonhow to use them . The four or five workshops we 've given over the past several months have been fun for me , and I 've certainly learned a great deal about using plants for dyeing . Even though I 've studied herbs for years , natural dyes are a recent interest , and I 'm continually amazed at the variety of plants that have been used throughout history to create color . Until the discovery of aniline dyes , fibers and fabrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1856 , an eighteen-year-old British chemistry student named William Perkin stumbled over the first synthetic dyethe color mauvewhen he was trying unsuccessfully to make quinine from coal tar . People were anxious to synthesize quinine , the herbal medicine that was the only successful treatment of malaria , because the bark of the cinchona tree , its natural source , was very difficult to obtain . ( Quinine was n't synthesized until World War II , when the Japanese seized the world 's supply of cinchona trees . ) Willy Perkin 's mauve not only sparked a new color craze but became the first step in the development of modern organic chemistry . In addition to helping me accumulate such fascinating oddments as the relationship between the cinchona tree and the color mauve , the workshops have also given me a chance to get to know Allison Selby better . She 's a strong , intelligent woman with an ironic sense of humor , although she is often moody and private and ... well , complicated . Our acquaintance goes back to our undergraduate years at the University of Texas ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we lost track of one another over the intervening years , and I did n't even know where she lived until she got in touch with me last spring about collaborating on the workshops . Ruby ( who had agreed to help us with the next Colors to Dye For ) finished fortifying herself against the chiggers and we waded through the grass , flicking off grasshoppers and pausing here and there to talk about the plants . My display gardens , which are designed to give people an idea of how various herbs look in a garden setting , are located on the grounds around Thyme and Seasons . Since they 're open to the public , I am compulsive about keeping the beds trim and tidy . When you visit , you 'll see squares and rectangles outlined with upright boxwood and principled brick paths , every weed ( well , almost every weed ) virtuously suppressed , as in a properly well-ordered English herb garden . If you are a gardener , you will appreciate that this takes time and dedicationa great deal of both , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is left over . As a result , the herbs and flowers and veggies and weeds tumble together in a riotous anarchy that I fondly call my " cottage garden , " but which might easily be mistaken for a stretch of impenetrable jungle . McQuaid refuses to go near it without a compass , a canteen , and a machete , and even I am careful about wandering through it , especially at twilight , when I can hear the plaintive cries of rain forest monkeys and the trumpeting of a distant elephant . At the far end of this tract of uninhibited chaos , I 've planted some of the dye herbs we 're using for the workshopssafflower , tansy , cosmos , marigolds , madder , woadand I wanted to show them to Allie . I 'd brought a basket , too , so we could gather some goldenrod . We turned the corner . " And this , " I announced , " is my dye garden . " I probably should have reconnoitered before I brought guests . Nobody said anything for a long time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that half-ironic , half-amused tone of hers . " Would you look at that ? I had no idea that sunflowers grew quite so tall . " Ruby craned her neck . " Somehow , " she remarked , " they make me think of Jack and the Beanstalk . Maybe there 's a pot of gold around here somewhere . " With all the rain we 've been having , the Hopi dye sunflowers were taller and larger than usual , their orange-rimmed heads plump with purple-black seeds . The safflowers , too , were vigorous and woody , while the unruly madder ( a distant cousin of that all-important cinchona tree ) was thigh-high and sprawling . The goldenrod had catapulted across the path and leapt like a shameless hussy into the iris bed . And there was the woad , a garden gorilla that some fastidious states have unfeelingly designated as a Class-A noxious weed . My woad looked as fierce as the ancient Britons who terrorized the Romans when they painted themselves with it . The plants were obviously dead set on taking over Texas and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was going to take courage and determination , and maybe a legion of Roman soldiers , to bring them under control . I sighed . " I think I 'd better put in a call to the woad police . Before it goes to seed . " " I 've got news for you , " Ruby said , pulling off a dried seed pod and handing it to me . " What color do you get from woad ? " " Blue , " Allie replied . " China 's got enough woad here to body-paint a whole clan of Picts . " She fingered a leaf . " In Europe , it was the major source of the color blue through the 1700s , but when the traders began importing indigo from the Far East , dyers sort of forgot about woad . If you want to know about blue , you need to ask Mayjean Carter . She 's got quite a collection of blue-dyed textiles . " " Forget about woad ? " Ruby asked nervously , gazing at my woad forest . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn my back on this stuff , even for an instant . " As we paused to fill the basket with goldenrod blossoms , we talked about the dye plants Allie wanted me to bring to the workshop , which was scheduled for Friday . " I 've just finished shearing , " Allie said as we started back toward the house , " so I 've got some new fleece . And Miss Mayjean has promised to bring some of the pieces from her indigo collection . " " I 'm looking forward to it , " Ruby said . " How are your girls ? " Ruby has never met Allie 's family , but she 's seen photos , of course . And she hears about them every time the three of us get together . " They 're having the time of their lives . " Allie brushed a gnat off her arm . " Shangrilama is keeping an eye on things , and Buckeye and Bronco are fat and sassy . I 'm getting rid of Rambo , though . He sneaked up behind me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him it 's time for him to hit the road . " Her grin seemed tight . " I do n't like to be knocked around . " I remember Allie saying something very similar during a painful divorce five years or so ago . She left her job as an art teacher in the Austin public schools and moved to a piece of land where her mother 's family had lived for generations . Since then , she has painstakingly bred a small herd of white and colored angora goatsthe " girls , " she calls them affectionately , although the herd includes a fiercely protective guard llama named Shangrilama , three conscientious angora bucks , and an assortment of rowdy kids . The angora is an ancient Turkish goat that is valued for its soft , luxuriant mohair . Colored angoras , however , have been bred only in the last few years . Their fleece is sold mostly to handspinners , who love the handsome dark colors of the fiber and the astonishing softness and strength of the spun yarn . As a shepherd and fiber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busiest women I know . She hand-shears her entire herd twice a year ; washes , cards , spins , and dyes the fleeces ; and weaves scarves and rugs and blankets that she sells , along with her fleeces and animals , at shows around the country . She also displays her hand-dyed items in various Hill Country shops , including Thyme and Seasons and the Crystal Cave , where she 's developed a dedicated following . And she offers a variety of workshops and classes at her farm and in Austin and Pecan Springs . Most of the year , this woman has more work than she can possibly do and mostly she thrives on it . But like many artists , Allie chooses to live on the margin , investing her time and energy in return for the pleasure of her animals ' company , the delight of her fiber creations , and not much money . Making ends meet must be a constant juggle , but , as I say , she seems to thrive . Today , however , I had the unsettling notion that Allie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber band that 's almost ready to snap , and there were blue shadows under her eyes . Her normal irony also seemed sharper than usual , less funny , more barbed . Her relationship , maybe ? She 'd been living with someone for the past couple of yearsperhaps they 'd split up . A failed love affair , coming after the divorce , would certainly be enough to turn her life sour . Or maybe she really had taken on too much . She 'd just gotten back from a fiber arts show in Colorado , and there was the Colors to Dye For workshop coming up on Friday and the Indigo Arts and Crafts Festival on Friday night and Saturday . Ruby and I had taken a booth , and we were planning to drive to Allie 's place on Thursday afternoon to set things up for the workshop . Allie had invited us to stay at her farm on Thursday and Friday nightsa good thing for us , since Indigo has no motels . But maybe it was n't a good thing for Allie . Maybe she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests . " Look , " I said . " It 's really kind of you to invite Ruby and me to stay with you and the girls at the farm this weekend . But maybe we should commute . It 's only an hour 's drive and having company just means extra work for you , on top of everything else . " Behind Allie 's back , Ruby gave me a surreptitious thumbs-up , and I knew she shared my concerns . She and I have been friends for so long that we occasionally seem to read each other 's mindsindicating , she claims , that I am finally beginning to develop my right brain . My biggest shortcoming , in Ruby 's view , is that I am too rational , too logical . Linear , she calls it . I should learn to think in circles . Allie lifted her head . " You can see right through me , huh ? " She sounded irritable . " Allie 's ready to snap ? " " Well , " I said , " you do seem a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a low sound in her throat . " You 'd be troubled , too , if you knew what 's going on in Indigo . " " So what 's going on in Indigo ? " I sat down on the old wooden swing that hangs from the live oak tree and patted the seat beside me . Allie sat down and stretched out her long legs . She did n't answer right away . Ruby pulled up a green-painted lawn chair , brushed leaves off the seat , and sat down . " There ca n't be much going on there , " she remarked , " aside from the festival , that is . It 's got to be the smallest living town in Texas . Why , it does n't even have a post office anymore . " " You do n't know the whole story , " I said , pushing the swing with my toe so that we swayed back and forth . " People are really committed to bringing Indigo back to life . " Allie had introduced me to several village leaders when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that , the Historical Indigo Restoration Committee , HIRC for short , had invited me to meet with them as an informal advisor , since I had been involved with a similar group in Pecan Springs . I was impressed by the energy the group had brought to the task of enticing visitors to Indigo , scheduling events like the Festival for almost every weekend . This fall , they had already staged an antique car rally and a bicycle race and were planning a folk music fiesta , a farmers ' market , and a holiday festival . If they kept coming up with good ideas like these , they were bound to succeed . Five years before , nobody would have given a plugged nickel for Indigo 's chances for surviving into the twenty-first century . It had been a lively little town once , with a busy cotton gin , a bank , a railroad depot , a two-story hotel , a grocery store , a feed store that also sold ranching supplies , a hardware store , a handful of saloons , and the Dalton County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rowdier customers . It had been a pretty town , too , with pecan and willow trees along the streets and a large park that bloomed with colorful wildflowers in the spring and summer . But times change and towns change . Indigo lost its vitality when the boll weevils chewed up the cotton , the Depression closed the stores , and the new highway swung ten miles in the opposite direction , taking the county seat with it . This sad business of dying towns , we 've seen it happen all over Texas , from the oil-patch towns that dried up when the crude stopped flowing to agricultural towns killed off by drought and the loss of cheap farm labor . People with money in their jeans climb into their pickups and drive to the city , where they get cheaper prices and a greater variety of goods and services . People without money go elsewhere to look for work . When their customers and their labor force disappear , the town 's businesses fold . Once they 're gone , the schools go , too , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Indigo . In the end , there was nothing left but a few old folks , living on their Social Security checks while they watched Indigo die around them . Until Allie , her friends , and HIRC began to bring Indigo back to life , that is . A dozen artistsspinners , weavers , dyers , potters , a wood-turner , even a blacksmithformed the Indigo Arts and Crafts Co-op . They rented the dilapidated cotton gin from Allie 's uncle , who owns most of what 's left of the buildings on Main Street , and renovated it into studio space and a gallery where they could display and sell their work . Somebody opened a coffee shop across the alley , somebody else opened a gift shop , and everybody chipped in to buy planters for Main Street , which they filled with redbud trees , herbs , and native plants . In April , when the bluebonnets were blooming , they held a successful Spring Arts and Crafts Festival , and now they were about to do it again . Indigo had died once , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the effort to resurrect it . " The population is growing , " Allie said , " but I 'm afraid that 's not going to make any difference . " There was a bitter twist in her voice . " Looks like we 've reached the end of the road . " " You ca n't mean that , " I exclaimed . " Why , just think how hard you 've worked to bring the town to life ! And with all the events you 've scheduled " " We 'll get through the festival okay , " Allie said , " and the events that are already on the calendar . But after that , there wo n't be any more town . The girls and I will have to move , too . " She made a hopeless gesture with her hands . " No more Indigo Farm . " " Wait a minute , " Ruby said , frowning . " I thought your farm belonged in your mother 's family . I thought you were leasing the land from your uncle , or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sourly . " It does . I am . " " Then what 's the problem ? " I asked . " Why ca n't you " " The problem is called ' mining rights . ' " Allie leaned forward in the swing , her elbows on her knees , her head down . She looked angry and discouraged . " In another year or two , the town of Indigo will not only be dead , but buried , and so will the farm . Every building , every tree , every blade of grass , even Indigo Creekit 'll all be gone . Bulldozed , ripped away , dug up , diverted . What 's left will look like a moonscape . The astronauts will be able to see the scars from space . " " Oh , no ! " Ruby exclaimed . " That ca n't be ! You ca n't mean it , Allie ! " " Oh , hell , " I said , beginning to understand . " It 's that strip mine , is n't it ? " " Right the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we could n't see if there were tears in her eyes . " And it 's all Uncle Casey 's fault , damn him ! "
