The Rev. Malcolm Boyd used to be an adman and TV producer ; now he is a San Francisco nightclub entertainer . <P> In-between times he is also an Episcopal priest who has some highly unorthodox notions about how religion ought to be presented to the modern world . Last week Father Boyd was making like a Mort Sahl or a Lenny Bruce and pulling down $1,000 a week in San Francisco 's dark and smoky hungry i . Sitting on a bar stool , his clerical collar shining in the spotlight , he is putting on a four-week act that includes readings from his book of unusual prayers , Are You Running with Me , Jesus ? ( TIME , Nov. 26 ) , and anecdotal ad libs on such subjects as premarital sex , homosexuality , integration and the institutional church . Says Father Boyd : " I 'm communicating that the church should get off its ass . " Some of the communications : <P> &gt; " A girl came to me and said , Tm not the religious type and I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants me to go away with him for the weekend . I feel horny . Have you anything to say ? ' So I quoted the Gospel according to D. H. Lawrence : ' Every parting means a meeting elsewhere . And every meeting is a new bondage . ' In other words , there is n't anything that does n't matter . " <P> &gt; " Who is my brother ? Is it the m:m who uses the same deodorant ? If Sams Peter and Paul came back , the churches would n't want them . Maybe they could get in here . I hope they could . " <P> &gt; " I think seminaries are one of the great problems . Instead of making people into polite ministers of the Establishment , I 'd try to break down the gulf between ordained clergy and other people . " <P> &gt; " When people talk about evangelism , they talk about Ghana or some faraway place , not the bar across the street . " <P> &gt; " I wonder why sex is the big hangup . I was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , people eating TV dinners on trays and ali . And the announcer said , ' Father Boyd , are you in favor of premarital sex ? ' And I replied in the only honest way I could : ' Do you mean masturbation , petting to orgasm , or coitus ? ' And he said , ' We must pause now for a commercial . ' " <P> Father Boyd gets mixed reviews . Variety called him " hipper-than-thou . " San Francisco 's Columnist Ralph Gleason dismissed his act as " boring " and advised him that " the nightclubs are in far less need of preachers than the cathedrals . " He sometimes has to deal with heckling spectators who have had a bit too much to drink , but in general the audience , which often includes priests and ministers , seems to like his act . The Rev. James Clark Brown , pastor of San Francisco 's First Congregational Church , calls Father Boyd 's appearance at the hungry i " the most effective and , for my money $3.50 a head , gutty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
