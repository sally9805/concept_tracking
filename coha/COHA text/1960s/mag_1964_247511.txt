In the predawn gloom at Leopold ville 's Ndjili Airport , the DC-8 jetliner whined to a halt on the hardstand . Almost coyly , it poked its nose between a pair of aircraft chartered to ferry the last United Nations soldiers away from the Congo . From the hatch of the first-class compartment stepped a tall , plump man in a severe black suit , grinning like an African Fernandel . Burly , rifle-swinging Congolese cops and nervous Surete plainclothesmen hustled him into a black Chevy Impala with government plates , and off he sped into the flower-and sewage-scented dark . Thus last week with fanfare and foreboding did Moise Kapenda ( " Moses the Beloved " ) Tshombe return to the Congo . <P> Come Home Again . A year ago , when he fled to Spain in exile , Tshombe was Moses the Hated . As the leader of copper-rich Katanga province 's abortive secession , finally crushed by the U.N. , he had been damned as a traitor to African nationalism and a stooge of the Belgians . But last week the stooge was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congo , that made as much sense as anything else . <P> Ironically , Tshombe came home on invitation of his onetime archenemy , Premier Cyrille Adoula , whose government now needs all the help it can get . Adoula 's inept 35,000-man army has proved itself incapable of suppressing Communist-encouraged rebellions that already engulf three provinces and are spreading even farther . To many , it seemed that his only hope was reconciliation with the dissident elements that rack the land . Adoula apparently agreed , however reluctantly . As a trial balloon , he permitted his secretary-general to call openly for the liberation of long-imprisoned Leftist Antoine Gizenga , and amnesty for Rightist Albert Kalonji , onetime Mulopwe ( god-emperor ) of south Kasai . <P> " Free Us ! Free Us ! " The Mulopwe accepted readily , flew in from Europe in such haste that none of his political allies were on hand at the airport to meet him . Balancing the return of Kalonji and Tshombe was the elimination of Jason Sendwe , leader of Katanga 's once rebellious Baluba tribe and provincial president of north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his lieutenants were knifed to death in Albertville by the Jeunesse , according to reliable reports . With the aid of the survivors , Adoula could form a compromise regime to keep some kind of order in the months ahead . <P> Tshombe , for one , was quite willing to be reconciled . After a four-hour meeting with Adoula , he called a press conference at Leopoldville 's Zoo Restaurant . While monkeys chattered and brightly dressed Congolese couples twisted to the music of the Conga Succes jazz band , a grinning Tshombe shook hands , signed autographs and proclaimed : " I 'm convinced that sincere , total reconciliation between all Congolese is the only absolute condition for saving the country from misery and anarchy . " The crowd shouted back : " Free us ! Free us ! " This was heady stuff , but then everything in the months ahead would be .
