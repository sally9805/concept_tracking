In the windy hills , the Austrian com mander surveyed the landscape of de feat . " We may need two years to turn the tide , " he said sadly . " They are so consistent . " <P> One hundred and sixty-one years after Austerlitz , Napoleon had triumphed again . This time , the hills were the slopes of Franconia , N.H. ; the contest was the North American Ski Championships ; and the formidable enemy commander was France 's Honore Bon net , 47 , otherwise known as the Napoleon of the sport . " That can only be , " disclaims the coach of the French ski team , " because I am not so tall and comb my hair to the front . " <P> There are more compelling reasons . <P> At Franconia , Bonnet 's troops were every bit as devastating as Napoleon I 's . " Le Superman , " Jean-Claude Killy , won everything in sight : the giant slalom , the slalom and the downhill , thereby clinching the 1967 World Cup . Behind him came Georges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perillat , second in the downhill . In the women 's events France 's Isabelle Mir won the women 's downhill , Christine Beranger the giant slalom , and Marielle Goitschel the slalom . Last week Bonnet took his forces on to Vail , Colo. , for the American Internationals Team Race . The in evitable result : Killy repeated his triple triumph , and France won still another team championship . <P> Sand &; Rectal Thermometers . The victories really belonged to Bonnet . And it was all the more remarkable because the twelfth child of an Alpine hotelkeeper was so late in showing an interest in the sport . He grew up determined to become a doctor ; he never set foot on skis until World War II , when he divided his time between the air force and the **25;1405;TOOLONG Resistance fighters . While in uniform , he learned to ski so well that at war 's end he was asked to take over training the army 's Alpine ski troops . There he stayed until 1959 , when a desperate French ski federation tapped him to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a world championship in eleven years . <P> Bonnet had two main ideas for his team : exercise and the egg . Until then , the prevailing form featured a skis-together , head-up posture . Bonnet reasoned that I'oeuf , a little used , head-down , feet-apart crouch , would give less aerodynamic drag and a lower center of gravity , thus making a skier faster and less likely to fall . The trouble was that it required fantastic strength to hold the egg for any length of time . Le coach , therefore , put les skiers through an exhaustive and exhausting daily ritual of deep knee bends with 60-lb. sacks of sand on their shoulders , forced them to climb endless flights of stairs , descend innumerable mountains to strengthen thigh muscles . On the slopes , he was the original martinet : barking orders to assistants through a walkie-talkie , charting every speed-slowing bump or hollow , taking the temperature of the snow with a rectal thermometer to be certain that precisely the right amount of wax was on the skis .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
