Shades of Tiny Tim ! The hottest recording discovery in the land these days is a tall , skinny , cross-eyed albino blues guitarist with limp , shoulder-length cotton white hair . He may look like a hippie Ichabod Crane , but Johnny Winter , 25 , is something else . Columbia Records has just signed him to a contract that could pay him $600,000 over the next five years , and concert managers have already begun to book him for as much as $7,500 a night . Yet three months ago , Johnny was bouncing from one dingy Texas joint to another for maybe $50 in a lean week . <P> Wow . Or , as Johnny himself puts it : " How can it be ? " The answer is partly that blues are big these days , partly that Johnny Winter is the swingingest , funkiest new white blues singer to come out of the South in years . His electric guitar crackles with a kind of voltage that can only come from the gut , not an AC outlet . His singing ranges from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many of his songs are his own-improvised on the spot , or written down the night before .

It 's what you feel at the time . " What Johnny feels at the time is likely to be a kind of sliding , " bottleneck " guitar playing in the classic twelve-bar blues pattern or keening " harp " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm playing without a band , I do n't change chords when I 'm supposed to-I change chords when I feel like it . That 's a primitive concept , but if it feels good and sounds good to me , then I 'll play it . " <P> The blues began feeling good to Johnny at the age of eleven , when he first heard the records of Robert Johnson , Howlin ' Wolf and Lightnin ' Hopkins on the radio down home in Beaumont , Texas . He began playing along on a hand-me-down guitar from his grandfather . Three years later , Johnny , 14 , and Brother Edgar , 11 , had their own band , Johnny and the Jammers . They made $8 a night for gigs across the border in Louisiana , where clubs were more lenient about age requirements . Edgar recalls that though Johnny only took enough lessons to pick up a few chords , he would practice four to six hours a day . " Johnny always said he was great , " says Edgar .
