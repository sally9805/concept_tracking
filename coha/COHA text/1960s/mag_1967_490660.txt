JUNE 9 IN the years since 1948 , when Israel fought its war of independence against Egypt , Jordan , Syria , Leb-anon , and Iraq , the Israeli government had to prepare for , among other undesirable contingencies , what the defense establishment referred to as Mikre H kol ( the Eventuality of Everybody ) ? a concerted attack upon Israel by all the Arab countries along its uneven , militarily and geographically unsound frontier . Until two weeks ago , the possibility of Mikre Hakol seemed quite remote . Then , by an incredible series of overlapping miscalculations by almost everyone involved in the Middle East , Israel was brought to the brink of annihilation , the United Nations  --  which , in a sense , had been born as a peace-keeping force in Palestine in 1949 ? was about to dissolve as even a useful forum over the same question in 1967 , and the Soviet Union and the United States narrowly missed a nuclear confrontation . The rapidity with which Israel won the war ( for such a small country there could he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to have bailed out the great powers and the U.N . ( although a statement by French Foreign Minister Couve de Murville , on June 7th , to the effect that France had foreseen the satisfactory outcome of events was greeted with hoots in the French Assembly , and British Foreign Minister George Brown found it necessary to remark , on the same day , in Parliament , " I deplore this tendency to giggle whenever the United Nations ' authority is mentioned " ) . The war for Israel was a costly one , brought on in part by the refusal of the ' Western nations , in a kind of displaced intellectual racism , to take any statements  --  including racist threats  --  made by the Arab nations seriously . Israel won , at great risk and with great sacrifice , alone . This time , it would not , for the sake of the gond will of its friends ( whose good faith had been tested and found wanting in events at the Gulf of Aqaba ) , subject itself to the same risks and sacrifices again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lead to that cooperative revival of the Middle East which had always been one of the dreams of Zionism . Israel has much to offer the Arab states ; and for Israel itself peace would mean an end to the strain of maintaining a constant posture of defense , of being forced to trade at a distance of thousands of miles instead of with its immediate and natural neighbors , and of being economically dependent on help from Jews in the Diaspora . But it is impossible to negotiate with someone who does not know where his own self-interest lies , and the radical regimes of Cairo and Damascus would have to negotiate reasonably , recognizing at last the existence of the Israeli state , or go . It is also impossible to inhabit a geographical absurdity . The Gaza Strip , which leads like a boarding ramp into Israel along the southwest coast ; the wedge of Jordan that protrudes into Israel from Jenin to the Dead Sea ( and that made possible the shelling of Tel Aviv on Israel 's west coast from a point well beyond its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves its civilian population virtually indefensible ; and the Syrian positions above Galilee , which made impossible any accommodation over water rights ( and which made the shelling of Israeli settlements , farmers , and fishermen such a common occurrence that for nineteen years northern Israelis have referred to mortar fire as " Syrian rainfall " ) ? in all these cases the boundaries would have to be redrawn . The Israelis would have to contribute to , and the Arab nations cooperate in , a resettlement of Arab refugees . But a simple ( and , as recent events have proved , meaningless ) guarantee by the United Nations would not do this time . All parties would have to work out the conditions under which they could live together and return from a twenty-year siege to their domestic concerns . To this end , Israel did not settle for a simple military victory , as it had in the campaigns of 1948 and 1956 . It persisted to the point of virtual annihilation of the Arab professional armies . The victory would bring  --  by force or by reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by preFmpting the news and capturing the popular imagination for a while , take some of the pressure off conflicts in other areas , notably . Vietnam . The West , without risking a soldier  --  without even , in fact , honoring one of its firmest commitments  --  had shared in a resounding victory over a Russian-supported totalitarian regime . The balance of power , or even the idea of the balance of power , and the relationship of the great powers to the small had been altered in ways that have yet to he fully explored ; the United States might have some new room , and Russia some new incentives , to negotiate . ( The fact that the Russians should have been supporting the Arab countries at all was one of the historical ironies of the situation . The Arabs had originally opposed the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine not out of anti-Jewish fanaticism but out of the Arab chieftains ' reasoned fear of what effect the sight of prospering Socialist cooperatives might have on their feudal sheikhdoms and caliphates . Russia , expecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recognize the State of Israel . Now the prospering immigrants found themselves viewed as colonialists , and the Arab regimes were using the arms of Moscow and some of the rhetoric of revolution . ) All this , of course , has been altered by the outcome of the Eventuality of Everybody . The speed and thoroughness with which this outcome was achieved make it seem in retrospect like a foregone conclusion . It was not . Even the fact that war should come , with anyone , in any form at all , at least so soon , did not seem , in the days preceding June 5th , anything like a certainty . THURSDAY , June 1st : An American Jew of German descent who now makes his home in New York arrived at Lod Airport , in Tel Aviv , and got into a battered old taxi , which was already carrying a few passengers , for the ride to Jerusalem . His daughter was spending her junior year abroad at the Hebrew University , and he was going to try to persuade her to come home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was afraid . He had been merely depressed by previous violations of international guarantees to Israel  --  free passage through the Suez Canal , for example , or free access to the Old City of Jerusalem  --  but the blockade of the Strait of Tiran had made it impossible for him to sleep . While the great powers temporized and rationalized , he felt that a little country 's territory and morale were being worn awa ) . It reminded him exactly , he said , of the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia . Foreseeing , as he thought , its inevitable consequences , he wanted his daughter home . The taxi picked up several passengers along the road ( which was nearly deserted but still lined with the carapaces of armored cars destroyed in 1948 ) , and on the outskirts of Jerusalem the worried gentleman got out . The city itself resembled , on that Thursday before the war , a sunny , sparsely populated colony for the infirm . Even the taxi-driver wore a leather glove concealing an artificial hand , and most of the pedestrians ( there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very young and scruffy and truant-looking . The King David Hotel was nearly empty , except for some journalists and a few indomitable tourists . Avram Zvi , the large , middle-aged manager of the King David , engaged his guests in merry conversation , and new arrivals at the reception desk were offered rooms overlooking the Old City ( " There you have the view " ) or overlooking the Y.M.C.A. on the Israeli side ( " There it is more safe " ) . The entrance to the Y.M.C.A. the scene of hitter fighting in I 948 ? was concealed by sandbags , but aside from these , and from the strange emptiness of the streets , Jerusalem had made no obvious preparations for a state of war . From some windows , the sound of radios tuned to Kol Yisroel , the Voice of Israel , drifted over the city . Since the early stages of mobilization , Kol Yisroel had been broadcasting only Israeli songs , Hebrew news , and ( recognizing that few Israelis over twenty-five speak the national language perfectly ) two news programs each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H ungarian , Russian , and Ladino . On Thursday , June 1st , Yisrnel announced in eight languages that theMapai Party of Premier Levi Eshkol had at last formed an etnergenc ) Cabinet with die Gahal Pam ' and with Ben Ginaco 's Rafi Party ( although BiGi himse : ' , as the Israelis call him , had remained aloof ) , and that the Rafi Party 's General Moshe Dayan had been appointed Minister of Defense . FRIDAY , June 2tul , ? in Tel Aviv was listless and stifling ) dull . The city was uncrowded , but it seemed as though everyone might merely be taking a siesta . In fact , quite a number of people were off at the beaches and swimming pools . Several international journalists , having exhausted their color stories about a proud , encircled people unafraid in the face of overwhelming odds , or the economic impossibility of maintaining a civilian army on perpetual alert , were preparing to go home . It began to seem that even the appointment of Dayan had been only a bit of stage business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small nations seemed now to he reduced . It appeared that Nasser 's production had all the angels , and that even lack of initiative had passed out of the hands of Israel to London , Paris , and Washington . The oppressive sense that nothing at all was going to happen created the feeling that access to the world 's attention was being closed along with passage through the Gulf of Aqaba . Israel seemed about to drop out of the news . At the Chaim Weizmann Institute , in Rehovoth , on Friday night , how-ever , people seemed both more active and less sanguine than in Tel Aviv . The Orthodox rabbis ea " in Jerusalem had announced that for the Army the obligations of the Sabbath were temporarily sus-pended , and some of the inhabit-ants of Rehovoth felt that war might begin the following morning . ( The rabbis had earlier suspended their cam-paign against autopsies , and this sort of concession had led some people to ex-pect wan on every Sabbath since the beginning of the crisis . ) The Weiz-mann Institute  --  whose cornerstone was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become over the years a kind of dream haven for pure science , an intellectual aerie amid green lawns , orange groves , and bougain-villaea between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv . Agricultural research at the In-stitute had contributed vitally to Israel 's unprecedented programs for reclama-tion of the soil . Theoretical research in nuclear physics and chemistry had succeeded so well that scientists were turn-ing their attention to newer fields , like high-energy physics and research with RNA . One of the country 's crowning and yet most characteristic achieve-ments , the Institute had for weeks been on an emergency footing . ( For one thing , a prevailing myth among the Arab nations that an atomic bomb was housed there made it a prime tar-get for enemy bombing . ) Of forty-three men at work on constructing a new building for the Institute , forty had been called up into the Army . Those members of the scientific staff who had not been called up as soldiers or mili-tary advisers , or put to work on special scientific projects related to mobiliza-tion , were busy taping windows or wrapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The children of the community were taking first-aid courses . Research biologists who had taken medical degrees but never actually treated patients were setting up emergency clinics . Sandbags and supports for basement ceilings were being put up in all the buildings of the Institute . In addition to their other work , scientists with walkie-talkies strapped to their waists took part in patrolling the Institute 's grounds at night . WAR , of course , did not break out on Saturday morning . Instead , wives and children took advantage of the Sabbath to join their men for picnics at the front . In effect , the front in a country of Israel 's size was everywhere . But border kikinazim like Nir Yitzhak and Shalom Karem , at the edge ? of the Negev and the Gaza Strip , were particularly full of families reclining with picnic baskets under the trees near the webby , shapeless tents in which the soldiers had been living for two weeks . The station wagons parked by the side of the road , and the tanned , rangy aspect of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely suburban commute from Scarsdale to the land of Owen Wister . The men  --  masons from Beersheba , hank tellers from Haifa , curtain manufacturers from Tel Aviv -- -were all dressed in highly personal varia tions on the Army uniform . In an army where no officer may order his men to charge , but only to follow him , there is a great deal of informality . " Tell my mother I am beautiful in my uniform , " a soldier helping the civilians of Nir Yitzhak harvest peaches said to a visitor from home . But , without any actual battle eagerness , the general attitude seemed to he " What are they waiting for ? " and " Let 's get it over with . " On Saturday afternoon , in Tel Aviv , Moshe Dayan held a press conference in which he apologized for having nothing to announce . He answered ever ) question urbanely , with a crooked smile , looking confident and slightly sinister . He remarked that he would be " glad and surprised " if a diplomatic solution to the blockade could he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposing of Egypt once and for all , he said , " I do n't think in war there is any such thing as ' once and for all . ' I do n't think ' once and for all ' can he applied to war . " Although Dayan had been able to infuse with all the drama of his person an interview that contained no news at all , the fact remained that there was no news and no clear way out , and that patience- was wearing thin . That evening at Rehovoth , some friends gathered for coffee in the living room of David Samuel , grandson of the first British High Commissioner for Palestine , and himself a professor of nuclear chemistry at the Institute . Three friends  --  Amos de Shalit , Michael Feldman , and Gideon Yekutieli  --  were professors there as well . One , Peter Hansen , was a young English research chemist , doing post-doctoral work at the Institute , who had chosen , for the duration of the crisis , against his embassy 's advice , to stay . Hansen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Dayan had not been appointed he would have been brought to power by a military coup . Everyone laughed . " How can they say a military coup ? " said Mrs. Yekutieli . " When an entire country has been called into the Army , a military coup would he an election . " There was a discussion of the restlessness of several men who had not been called up : a frogman , a paratrooper , and a middle-aged pilot . ( The pilot subsequently offered his services as a crop duster . ) Mrs. Samuel said that she thought an insufficiently hearty welcome was being accorded the volunteers who were coming into Israel from other countries to fight , to give blood , or to work . She felt there should at least he a poster to greet them at the airport . " It could he a tourist poster also , " someone suggested . " ' See Israel While It Still Exists . ' " ON Sunday , June 4th , a number of soldiers  --  a tenth of the Army , according to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several of the North African soldiers ( sometimes referred to euphemistically as the Southern French ) took advantage of their leave to return for a day to their families in the port of Elath . Elath seemed confident that war would not break out there . In the first place , people said , the port was now too strongly fortified , and , in the second , at the first sign of trouble the soldiers would blow up the neighboring port of Aqaba , Jordan 's only outlet to the sea . In tents all along the beach , near the empty resort hotels , was the remnant of an international collection of waifs and strays with long hair and guitars whom one now finds in so many unlikely places , and who had long been making Elath a beatnik nomad 's rendevvous When they needed food , they scrounged it from the local citizens or from the Army . When they needed money , they presented themselves in the morning at a cak called Leon 's , where they were recruited to dig trenches or to work for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they gathered in a discotKque called the Half Past Midnight ( where Lhere were also several African students who had been stranded in Elath when their passage home through the Gulf had been postponed by the blockade ) . Asked why the nomads had not taken the advice of their various embass'es and left the port , a long-haired guitar player from Stuttgart looked up cheerfully and said , " Was ? Wenn es grad lustig wird ? " ( Soldiers emplaning on a civilian flight from Elath to TeI Aviv were asked to check their guns in the cargo section . ) On Sunday night , at Rehovoth , the professors ' wives were just completing their course in how to render assistance at the Kaplan Hospital if war should break out . The cement walls of the still uncompleted building in which they met were lined with stretchers and sawhorses to put the stretchers on . The women were issued forms , in duplicate , on which they could check off a doctor 's diagnosis , and thereby save him the time of writing things down himself . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to a seasoned medical man a casualty of war looks different from any other sort of patient After the first four hours , he assured them , they would get used to it . He reviewed the forms with them , the ways of ascertaining the wounded man 's identity ( the pockets of civilian casualties , who did not , of course , have dog tags , would have to be searched ) , and he went down the checklist for gravity of wounds  --  mild , medium , serious , mortal . There were several questions about the word " mortal . " The doctor had used the wrong word in Hebrew  --  one meaning " mortal " in the sense of " human being . " The matter was soon cleared up . One of the women crouched on the floor with her hands locked behind her head to show the position her daughter in kindergarten had been taught to adopt in case of bombing . " ' This is how the bunny sits , ' she told me , " the woman said . " Sec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Army informed the civilian guard at Rehnvoth that the ) might let up on the security watch . ON Monday , June 5th , at B the air-raid sirens went off all over Israel , and everyone knew that the country was at war . In one of the bomb shelters at Or Institute , five languages were being spoken , with absolute calm , he scientists , children , visitors , and maids . A few minutes later , the all clear sounded , and everyone went to work , as though it were an ordinary day . Genera Dayan 's voice came over the radio , speaking to the troops and announcing that tank battles were taking place at that moment in the Negev . " A ttaque d 1'a,4077 , one of the scientists said as lie walked to his laboratory . " That 's good for us . It means that we 've got the rising sun in the east behind us . In the Negev , the sun is pretty blinding . " At 10 A.M. Monday , in his office , Meyer Weisgal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a good friend of the late Chaim Weizmann , and one of the greatest fund-raisers of all time , was dictating  --  to his wife , Shirley  --  some telegrams to Americans , appealing for funds for war relief . Guns could be heard in the distance , planes were screaming overhead , and sirens , ir which the Weisgals ignored , went off from time to time . " Send them Full-rate , Mrs. Weis-gal , " said Ya ki , theirchauffe ur and handyman . " We 're going to win this war . " When Mr. Weisgal had fin-ished dictating , the telegrams were tak-en into the next room for his secretary to type . As guns , planes , and sirens Con-tinued to sound ( by this time , it was be-coming nearly impossible to distinguish the alert from the all clear , so that half of Israel was undoubtedly going down into the shelters while the other half was coming out of them ) , Mr. liVeis-gal told a joke . A Jew , he said , was walking down the street , crying bitter-ly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . " You see , " said the Jew , " I am an " An optimist ? " said the friend . " Then why are you crying ? " " So , " said the Jew . " You think in these times it 's so easy to he an opti-mist ? " Someone turned on the radio , where the code names of units designated For full mobilization were being read out : Alternating Current , Pleasant Shaving , Peace and Greetings , Electric Broiler , Bitter Rice , Silver Lining , Wedding March , Gates of Salvation . There were twenty-three in all , and buses were lining the main street of Rehovoth to pick up the men called to duty . There were more thundering sounds , and Mrs. Weisgal said , " When I think of the casualties . When think of the mothers . " The siren went off again . " Do n't listen , " Mr. Weisgal said , and instructed her to read him a letter that had arrived that morning . The letter , written five days before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was an air-raid alarm ( it turned out to have been a mistake ) ; there had been none during the night . Bus service to Jerusalem was almost normal , except that , on account of Israeli Army emplacements , buses had to make a detour of several kilometres through En Karelia . On one bus , Kol . Yisroel was audible , and , looking over into Jordan from the highway , one could see smoke rising from a town on Jordan 's wedge into Israel and verify the report that Israeli troops were taking Lamm . Because Jerusalem had been shelled throughout the night ( the Egyptian general , who , under the terms of the Hussein-Nasser pact , had been put in charge of Jordan 's Army , had often in the past expressed his belief in the shelling of civilians , since it diverted troops to their defense ) , and was still being shelled by day , most of the population of the city was in shelters . Israeli troops were attacking gun emplacements in the Old City , taking care to observe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if possible . The King David Hotel had incurred minor damage  --  a tree down , a few broken windows , some slight injuries to members of the staff  --  but Avram Zvi , who had been called up , was now wearing a uniform and seemed enormously gratified . In the streets outside , a few helmeted civilians and some restless little boys kept telling one another to walk close to the walls and to run across streets leading toward Jordan . From several directions , there was the sound of machine-gun and mortar fire . In the early afternoon , three journalists walked into the government press office and were received with cheers . Accredited to Jordan , they had been stationed in the Old City , unable to file copy , for several days . When the Israeli troops came , they had simply walked across into the New City to file their copy there . Then they walked back again . It was announced that General Dayan had had tea on Mount Scopus that morning . Sometime in the course of Tuesday , an Army official called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had invited delegates from Rehovoth , from Technion , from the Academy , and from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem . ( Because of the peculiar configuration of the shelling at that hour , the professors from Jerusalem were unable to attend . ) He wanted to ask their advice on a number of questions , and to brief them on the progress of the war . The war was succeeding so far beyond the most optimistic expectations that there were problems that must be faced at once . The entire Egyptian Army had been mobilized at the front when the war began , but Israel had spent the tense waiting period retraining reserves and repairing machinery , and the Egyptian Air Force had been destroyed in the first hours of Monday morning . Apparently misled by the true reports over Kol Yisroei that many Israeli border settlements had been attacked , and by the false reports from the Voice of Thunder in Cairo that Beersheba had been taken and that Tel Aviv was in flames , King Hussein of Jordan  --  to the surprise and special regret of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the afternoon the Jordanian Air Force was destroyed as well . The Syrians , originally the country most rabidly committed to the immediate extermination of Israel , were apparently enraged by the reconciliation between Nasser and Hussein , whom Damascus was still determined to overthrow . Syria had entered the war by degrees throughout the day , and by nightfall the Syrian Air Force was destroyed . Fighting was going well on the ground on all fronts , and the problem was where to stop . Hussein , it seemed , was powerless to forbid the shelling of Jerusalem by Jordanian troops under Egyptian command , so it would be necessary for the Israelis to take the Old City . ( The Rockefeller Institute , containing the Dead Sea Scrolls , the Army spokesman announced , smiling ironically at the particular stir of interest that this aroused in his scholarly audience , had already been captured . ) It was clear that Jerusalem could not be divided again . Would it be a good idea to announce plans to internationalize the Old City before it was completely in Israeli hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captured Egyptian documents , which had been translated only the night before , revealed that Nasser was far more seriously committed to the destruction of Israelis as Jews , and far more taken with the old Nazi programs , than had been supposed ; plans , on the Nazi model , had been drawn up for the dine after Israel 's defeat . The question was whether to release these documents . What Israel wanted from this war , after all , was a lasting peace with its Arab neighbors , The two primary obstacles to this peace were the problems of Palestine and the Arab refugees . These problems could he solved . What purpose would he served in humiliating an already defeated Arab people by revealing the plans its leader may have had for destroying civilians ? The question was discussed , inconclusively , for some time . Finally , the spokesman raised a question that had been puzzling the administration : What had happened to Egypt 's missiles ? Were the ones shown so often on parade merely dummies ? He mentioned other possibilities : mechanical failure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Moscow to avoid what would have been purely futile destruction of cities . This led him to another matter : The Russians were not famous for their loyalty to losers , and the Arabs had lust . Was there any point in approaching the Russians now  --  or , at least , the Rumanians , who had declared themselves in such moderate terms ? Several professors of Russian descent expressed themselves emotionally on the prospect of a rapprochement with their native land , but the others seemed skeptical . Certain questions , the spokesman said , in concluding the discussion ( several professors present had to return to their laboratories or their military units ) , would simply be resolved by events , hut , he said , " Wc will settle for nothing but peace this time . " IN the blacked-out living room of Professor David Samuel , on Tuesday , the second night of the war ( which had ceased , after its first few hours of uncertainty , to seem , except at the front , anything like war in the movies ) , the members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , Minna ; Tally , a girl of eighteen , who had been studying for her baccalaureate examinations ; Yoram , a boy of fifteen , who had been compulsively volunteering for every kind of service since the war broke out ; and Naomi , a girl of three , who had slept on Monday night in the shelter , and who now went to bed making siren noises . Tally said that her English exam for the following morning had been cancelled ? " obviousiy . " And Yoram announced that not only had he been put in charge of any fractures that might occur if his school were bombed but he was being called out that night for courier duty . " Well , if you think relish the idea ... " his mother began , and then simply advised him to change his undershirt . At nine , Professor Samuel left on some errand about which no one asked , and which was to occupy him until morning . Igo Yisroe reported , with the understatement that it was to display throughout the war , that fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border . ( In fact , Gaza had fallen , and soldiers were already beginning to find pairs and clusters of boots in the desert , which , they knew from the 1956 Sinai campaign , meant that the Egyptians were in barefoot rout . ) The Jerusalem Post for the day , in mentioning the fact that casualties were beginning to come into Israeli hospitals , and that all of them were patient and brave , did not neglect to mention a soldier who , with one eye shot away and the other damaged , was as brave as the rest . He was a Jordanian legionnaire , the Post reported , and he kept repeating the only Hebrew words he knew : " We are brothers . We . are brothers . " Someone mentioned that a Hebrew idiom for Arabs is " cousins , " or " sons of our uncle , " and that although the connotation was slightly pejorative , it need not always he that way . Someone praised the bravery , in particular , of the 3 : rdanian legionnaires . " I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no hinterland , " Yoram said , " We ca n't swim to America . We simply have nowhere else to go . " He left through the blacked-out doorway and went into the moonlight , to begin his courier duty . " A perfect night for bombing , " he said , looking into the clear sky . But there were no alarms at all that night . ON Wednesday morning , the casual- ties began pouring out of buses into the Kaplan Hospital , where the Rehovoth wives were waiting to work . Tally 's class at school was called to help out , and Professor Samuel remarked as he drove her to the hospital , " I do n't know what these girls are going to see there . " The wounded were silent , and as each stretcher was brought in it was immediately surrounded by many volunteers of both sexes , solicitous of the comfort of the wounded man . It turned out that among those critically wounded on the previous day was the son of the gynecologist who had had difficulty with the word " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , the Army , it is n't an anonymous thing , " someone . remarked . " To us , everyone killed at the front is a tragedy . " By nightfall , Kol Yisroel reported that the Israelis had taken Sharm-elSheik , the shofar had long been blown at the Wailing Wall by the chief rabbi of the military , and Meyer Weisgal , sitting in his own darkened house with his wife and a group of friends , was contemplating the offers of help for the Institute he had received from patrons and scientists all over the world . Later still , Professor Samuel ( doubtless like many other professors at the Institute , and like citizens all over Israel ) put away a pistol , which had served him in former wars ( he had been in four of them : in 1939 , 1948 , 1956 , and 967 ) , and with which he had been prepared to defend his family  --  in that oasis of technology , in a nation of two and a half million  --  if the war had gone otherwise @
