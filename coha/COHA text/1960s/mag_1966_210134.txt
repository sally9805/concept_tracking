Howard Hughes , the billionaire eccentric , has had money and power in quantity . But nothing ever seemed to mean so much to him as his control of Trans World Airlines . A pilot obsessed , Hughes , now 60 , once set a coast-to-coast speed record , flew round-the-world in 91 hours in 1938 , conceived the Constellation airliner , was badly hurt in two crashes . He bought control of TWA from Lehman Bros , in 1939 , becoming the only operating chief of a major U.S. airline who also owned it . After a long series of bitter battles with bankers and managers , he found his airline bogged in debt and was forced in 1960 to turn over the management to hostile trustees .

The handsome heir to an oil-drilling-equipment fortune , he bought his way into the movie industry , produced Hell 's Angels and Scarface , discovered Jean Harlow , personally designed the brassiere that made Jane Russell famous . He was a friend to Lana Turner , Ava Gardner , Katharine Hepburn . Then he steadily became more of a loner . He secretly married green-eyed Actress Jean Peters in 1957 .
