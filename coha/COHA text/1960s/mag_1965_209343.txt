He hesitates before the glass door of the downtown building , then pushes through and climbs a narrow staircase to the second floor . There he pauses again before the well-advertised insignia on another door , squares his shoulders and steps into a brightly lit room filled with the murmur of Muzak melo dies . The man is 37 , married , and a fa ther . He is a steady wage earner with a $6,092-a-year income . He is also in debt ( to the tune of $513 ) and pressed by his creditors . He is a typical customer who has come to solve his problems - at least for the moment - by borrowing from the Household Finance Corp. , the oldest and largest of the nation 's thriv- ing small-loan companies . <P> Except for the trudge upstairs ( where quarters are cheaper ) , Chicago-based Household Finance makes the process of borrowing so simple that 2,000,000 Americans a year go into debt to it . Relying chiefly on its quick judgment of an applicant 's ability and his willingness to repay , the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the rest through a legally loose chattel mortgage on borrower 's household goods . Its sharp-eyed loan managers turn down 64% of would-be borrowers-but that leaves plenty . Household Finance has doubled its loan business in ten years . <P> Winning Footholds . To keep up with its growing business , Household is adding another 70 offices to its present 1,4.17 offices in 48 states and all ten Canadian provinces . Parrying the invasion of consumer finance by appliance makers and hard-goods retailers , the company is also winning footholds in their fields . In the past four years it has bought up two retail subsidiaries that sell hardware , paint and kitchen equipment through 978 franchised and 72 company-owned stores . Last week Household moved into merchandising on a major scale . It arranged a stock-swap deal to acquire City Products Corp. , an Illinois conglomerate that controls 3,020 retail outlets through its Ben Franklin and T.G. &; Y. variety stores , its Barker Bros , furniture chain and a food-chain supply house . <P> Though City Products ' $393 million in sales last year dwarfed Household Finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere $8,639,000 v. H.F.C. 's record $35,485,000 . Why , then , did the loan firm want City Products ? Household 's bluff , $168,704-a-year president , Harold E. MacDonald , 65 , who spent 22 years in retailing , figures that the same talents that enable H.F.C. to merchandise small loans so successfully will work to produce profits in retail chain merchandising . Since he took over the 87-year-old finance company in 1951 , MacDonald has tightened up operations , spruced up offices and standardized procedures so much that 37% of H.F.C. 's revenues so far this year has become pretax profit .
