Last week , on top of the conflict in Viet Nam and Indonesia 's " confron tation " with Malaysia , yet another war smoldered in Asia as India and Pakistan wrestled for control of long-disputed Kashmir ( see THE WORLD ) . <P> Neither nation , fortunately , had enough petroleum , spare parts or ammunition for a protracted , all-out war . <P> As one of the chief sources of weapons for both sides , the U.S. immediately decided to cut off their supplies .
