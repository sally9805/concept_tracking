When intercity buses last year matched the railroads in total passenger miles for the first time in U.S. history , no one was less surprised than a burly , blue-eyed Texan named Maurice Edwin Moore . As president of Transcontinental Bus System , Inc. , Moore , 51 , has built one of the nation 's fastest-growing businesses on the proposition that as far as mass transportation by land is concerned , the bus is the wave of the future . <P> Starting with a cow-town Texas line during World War II , Moore in the past 19 years has pieced together Transcontinental 's operating subsidiary , Continental Trailways , and built it into the second largest U.S. bus system , with 53,000 miles of routes in 34 states . Compared with the top dog in the bus business , giant Grey hound , Continental is still a pup , but it is growing at a rate to give Greyhound pause . Last week , while Greyhound was reporting a 2.5% increase in its 1961 operating revenues ( to $334 million ) , Continental announced that its revenues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even more impressive , Continental 's 1961 profits soared by 42.6% to $3,000,000 . <P> Assembling an Octopus . Moore , who bosses his expanding empire from a foam-rubber bus seat ( " It 's the best desk chair I 've found " ) in Continental 's Dallas head quarters , started out at 18 as a ticket agent in the Little Rock bus depot . In those days the U.S. bus business consisted largely of a patchwork of local companies that seldom traveled more than a few towns down the road . Recalls Moore : " In my first year a man wanted to buy a ticket to Dallas . I told him he could n't get there by bus . " But Moore learned quickly . In 1943 he bought Fort Worth 's Bowen Motor Coaches with the help of a group of backers and soon decided that " the more miles of route you 've got , the more miles you 've got to spread your overhead out on . " In 1945 he am bitiously renamed the line Continental Trailways and set out to get those miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-haul interstate routes and the ICC was unwilling to franchise new ones , Moore was obliged to build up his system by buying small local bus lines in a careful pattern that linked them into new long-haul routes . Octopus-like , Continental stretched its tentacles across the Southeast and into the Midwest ; by 1953 the company had its first transcontinental route ( it now operates five ) . At that point Moore found that his fledgling system lacked the equipment to capitalize on the bus industry 's greatest potential asset : the growing U.S. network of superhighways . <P> To remedy this , Moore tried to buy copies of Greyhound 's popular big Scenicruiser . But General Motors , which manufactures the Scenicruiser , turned him away . The Scenicruiser dies , explained G.M. , belonged to Greyhound , and would be all tied up on Greyhound production for years to come . Undaunted , Moore ordered his engineers to design a big new bus of their own . Then he went ahead and lined up a Belgian firm to build them , and by 1957 had the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
