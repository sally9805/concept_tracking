COLLEGE BASKETBALL <P> In Princeton 's college-boy lingo , Bill Bradley , 20 , is known as a " straight arrow " - meaning , says a classmate , that " he is just what his parents think he is . " He does not drink or smoke or chew . He studies seven hours a day for a B average , goes to Presbyterian church on Sunday and polishes off by teaching Sunday school . That would be enough to set him apart on most campuses , but there is more : he is the first All-America basketball player in Princeton 's history , and quite possibly the best college player in the game . <P> Last week stubborn Lafayette put three men on Bradley , and sometimes there were five . He still shook loose for 27 points-including a basket in the last 2 sec. that tied the game and sent it into overtime . With 35 sec. left in the overtime period and the Tigers trailing by two points , he sank another clutch shot-and the game went into double overtime . Then Bradley coolly dumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , 69-64 . Three days later , he scored 31 points as the Tigers sank Navy , 80-76 . That brought Bradley 's scoring total to 130 points in just four games , gave Princeton a 3-1 start on another winning season that could well earn the Tigers their fourth Ivy League championship in five years . <P> 58 in a Row . Most high scorers are " gunners , " whose natural inclinations are to let fly whenever they get their hands on the ball . Not Bradley . He does everything well-dribbles , rebounds , decoys and sets up plays . If anything , he upsets his coach by passing off to a teammate too often . But when he does shoot-swish ! Rare is the pro who hits on 50% of his field-goal attempts . As a college sophomore last year , Bradley banged in 48% , is up to 52% this year , and he once sank 58 consecutive free throws-something that no pro has ever done . Basketball buffs rave about his " great eye " and " touch . " But Bradley snorts at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says , " a self-discipline that makes you practice in one spot until you make 25 baskets from that spot , a self-discipline not to go to bed until you 've finished an assignment , a self-discipline that makes you get up at 9 a.m. on Sunday and go to church instead of sacking in . " <P> Even as a youngster in Crystal City , Mo . ( pop . 4,000 ) , Bradley seemed too good to be true . By the time he started tenth grade , he was already his present height of 6 ft. 5 in . In high school he scored 3,066 points . An honor student , president of the Missouri Association of Student Councils , Bradley sifted through something like 75 college offers , at one point had almost decided on Duke ; he even signed a " letter of intent " to accept a scholarship . But then he started rereading college catalogues-and decided that Princeton was brainier . " I do n't want to end up as just Old Satin Shorts Bradley , " he explained at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chest . " Every time I hear his name , I get a sharp pain right here . "
