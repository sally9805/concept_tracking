M. , Eastern Daylight Time today . Originally set for 7 A. M. yesterday the launching was postponed late Monday night because of a sudden overcast . Ever since , thunder showers have been wetting the whole central Florida area , including the Cape Canaveral ' launching area . But weather forecasters de ? cided early today that there would be big enough breaks in the cloud cover by morning to make possible the nation 's second manned flight into space . Project Mercury officials // therefore fixed a new take-off time and planned to pick up the final six hours of the countdown . Fuel For Rocket Resuming the count meant : starting to fuel the Redstone rocket booster with its liquid , oxygen , or " lox. " oxidizer . Any . postponement after that would have to be for fortyeight hours to provide time for a thorough cleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was required before the Project Mercury team succeeded , on May 5 , in sending Navy Comdr . Alan B. Shepard Jr . on the nation 's first manned space sortie . The second shot is to be almost a duplicate of the Shepard flight ? about 115 miles into the sky and 290 miles down the Atlantic missile range to a waiting fleet of recovery ships. , Captain Grissom , 35 yearss , old , who flew 100 missions in Korea , and his alternate , Marine Lieut . Col. John H. Glenn . 40 , were " quite relaxed " about the cancellation of yesterday 's launching attempt . Pilot Is Ready When the new launching time was tentatively decided on . Captain Grissom told Walter C. Williams . the project 's Operations Director : " I 'm ready whenever you are . " Both the captain and Colonel ' Glenn , who had learned about the delay after turning in Mon day night , were up early yesterday . They took a run on the beach '  --  a training routine followed daily by Colonel Glenn and less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the run , Captain Grissom decided to vary the low- ! residue diet he and Colonel Glenn have been on since Sat-. urday . He went surf fishing and : came up with a four-pound bass , which was the main course for breakfast . In the afternoon , the captain , boned up on his flight routine in the procedures trainer in the : Project Mercury control center . This is a duplicate of the two-ton capsule poised to take the captain on his rocket ride out to sea . The capsule has been named Liberty Bell 7 . The number seven designates the number of astronauts in the program , and serves to emphasize that the successive shots are combined efforts involving all the astronauts and dozens of highly trained engineers and scientists manning consoles here and down the missile range . In this connection , Captain Grissom will have the advantage of having Commander Shepard at the other end of the capsuleto-ground communications link . Shepard 's Advice The commander , having been through it all , might be able Ito offer valuable advice if ' Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be used for eventual orbital flights that would match Yuri Gagarin 's historic " first " of April 12 . Officials now hope that the first orbital flight can be accomplished by early in 1962 . Yesterday was a relaxed day , in the main , in the crew quarters . Flight preparations were at a minimum because so much had been gone over Monday . I There was a small birthday party for Colonel Glenn , whose fortieth birthday fell yesterday . Oldest Astronaut He is the oldest of the seven astronauts . Forty was the cutoff age for selection of the 110 astronaut candidates originally screened . It had been widely assumed , after he served as alternate for Commander Shepard , that Colonel Glenn would I get the assignment for the second flight . The position of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is that Robert R. Gilruth , director of Project Mercury , has made his choices on the basis of which astronaut he felt to be most ready at the moment . There has been speculation that the Air Force was given the assignment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is denied by officials .
