txt BY GEORGE TAGGE More than 1,500,000 Illinoisans will vote today in the nation 's first major primary , with the important contests clustered on Republican ballots . It remains to be seen whether G. 0 . P. leaders are correct in saying the turnout here will be a " tax march on the polls . " They report a spirit of revolt because of higher property taxes now due for payment . Most of the protest talk concerns Mayor Daley 's proposed 66 million dollars in bond issues . Republican leaders contend this will bring out many resentful Democrats who will vote for G. 0 . P. nominees for seven Superior court judgeships in a special judicial election in Cook county . Big ' Sewer , Renewal Issues Of ' the 66 million dollars in bond issues to be voted on , 45 million is for urban renewal and sewer construction . The 22.5 million dollars earmarked for urban renewal would be used to accelerate projects in such neighborhoods as Englewood and Lincoln ' Park . Federal funds would match the local money in the ratio of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for 14 miles of trunk sewers to augment sewer improvements started in 1947 . Street Lighting Bonds Another 7 million dollars of the bonds ould go for street lighting , and a similar amount to finance a fourth refuse incinerator on the northeast side , to improve two incinerators , complete a third , and purchase sites for disposal of incinerator residue . Four million dollars of the bonds are to replace the Diversey avenue and Kedzie avenue ' bridges and build a viaduct in Halsted street between Hubbard and Wayman streets . Three million dollars are to be allocated to replace several fire stations and to finance improvements at police headquarters and the police garage . Mayor Daley said his bond issues will be approved by at least 2 to 1 , possibly 2 1/2 to 1 . Without predicting pluralities , he said the Democratic judicial ticket will be elected . He sidestepped a question as to whether he will run for a third term next year . Future control of the Illinois Supreme court may be involved in a special election for a vacancy in the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push to capture this vital seat Stars of the Nov. 6 election have mild tryouts today . Everett M. Dirksen , Republican leader in the Senate , has Harley D. Jones for a rival in today 's primary . Rep. Sidney R. Yates of Chicago , Democratic organization choice for senator , has Lar America First Daly as a nominal opponent . Daly has run often in the past , but not far . Two State Contests Close Illinois voters will decide two close G. 0 . P. races for state nominations . State Rep. Walter J. Reum of Oak Park , a conservative anchor for 10 years in the legislature , is chiefly contested for-nomination for state treasurer by William J. Scott , a Chicago lawyer and banker , with Maurice J. Coburn of Chicago lagging . The Republican primary also offers a contest for the man who will run Nov. 6 against George T. Wilkins , the Democrat who is unopposed today for nomination for reelection as state superintendent of public instruction . Ray Page of Springfield , high school teacher and well known basketball coach , may ups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will county schools . Bottino has most of the press and G. 0 . P. organization support , but Page has put on a strong campaign . More heat than in these contests has been generated by the G. O. P. race for county treasurer nomination in the only county-wide battle here . Kucharski ' Slight Favorite ' Edmund J. Kucharski , twice victor in Cook county elections for county recorder and Superior court clerk , is rated a slight favorite against Elmer W. Conti , state representative and village official . In Chicago wards controled by the west side bloc the precinct workers were reported to be concentrating all their efforts for Conti . Heavy spending by Conti forces was reported on the south side . However , top G. 0 . P. leaders say they expect Kucharski to carry all except the west side bloc wards . With the indorsement of the Better Government association , Kucharski will run strong in the suburbs , they said . John W. Bickley Jr. , chairman of the Kucharski citiiens ' committee who , as a federal prosecutor , obtained . a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue is whether the west side bloc controls the Republican party . The north suburban 13th congressional district has a contest which is a conflagration compared with any other in the state . There seems to be no question but that this area will have the largest percentage turnout today of any in Illinois . Donald Rumsfeld is likely to defeat State Rep. Marion E. Burks for the Republican nomination to run next fall in place of Rep. Marguerite Stitt Church of Evanston . She declined to run for a seventh term . Business Plagues Burks Burks has been plagued with two months of publicity about his connections with three insurance companies . Most of it concerned the Central Casualty company , now being liquidated , of which be was board chairman until Dec. 15 . Funds have been impaired to the extent of about a million dollars , according to Joseph S. Gerber , state director of insurance . Gerber said that at least 12.500 shares of stock were issued without authorization . Burks said his alleged signatures on the stock are forgeries . Francis X. Connell , Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the registered voters in the 13th district will go to the polls today . In the suburbs generally , Chairman Connell looks far a 45 per cent turnout . In Chicago , his prediction was 35 per cent . Democrat Estimates Lower Democratic election officials predict smaller turnouts altho. conceding a larger vote than in the comparable 1958 non-Presidential primary . Sidney T. Holzman , Chicago election board chairman , figures on a 30 per cent turnout in the city , altho be said it " could be " higher . George R. McCollotn , head of elections for County Clerk Edward J. Barrett , sees only a 30 per cent turnout in the suburbs . In 1958 there was a paltry turnout-29.39 per cent of registration in Chicago and 21.85 per cent in the suburbs . Cook county 's average was 27.30 per cent Downstate had a turnout of about 37 per cent . - Absentee Vote Higher This season the Cook county absentee vote is running about 3 to 1 over 1958 .
