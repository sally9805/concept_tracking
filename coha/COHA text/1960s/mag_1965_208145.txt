The New Year prophets have come and gone . And the average businessman is now trying to summarize their messages and find out what they said . First , he finds that financial as well as other doctors disagree ; second , that when such messages from the master minds of Business really say anything , it is apt to be limited to the district or business in which the particular master mind is preeminent . <P> SO started a TIME story in the issue of Jan. 7 , 1924 , as the weekly newsmagazine , looking back on its own first year of existence , " reviewed " the U.S. economy and , taking into consideration the dangers of economic prophecy , refrained from making any forecasts . <P> Ever since , TIME has in one form or another presented what has come to be called its Year-End Business Review . Yet " review " seems an unsatisfactory word . In business , as in all fields of human endeavor , one of TIME 'S major aims is always to review the news-not just in the details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but within the context of the more distant past . <P> Still , we believe we would be failing in our function if we were to offer only a compendium of the past without reference to the future , if we were to concentrate on the accomplished while neglecting the accomplishable . Economic prophecy remains a hazardous proposition , but likelihoods can be drawn from present trends and past experiences . <P> It is in that sense that this issue 's cover story falls within the category of the Year-End Business Review . It is less a review than an analysis of that phenomenon of modern times - the Consumer Economy . The consumer , of course , has been around for a long while , and anyone who has ever gone as far as Economics I recognizes at least his abstract force for sustaining prosperity or hastening recession . <P> But the individual consumer is not apt to think of himself as an economic power . When he thinks about it , he is more likely to feel himself at the mercy of governmental and business trends beyond his ken or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes feels himself the victim of surly salespeople and shoddy goods . And when he starts feeling too strongly along such lines , he may start sitting on his wallet . <P> Few people understand this better than Jack Straus , boss of the world 's largest store and the man who appears on the cover . He was chosen as a representative of the best among U.S. retailers-and for helping bring out the best in the U.S. consumer , thereby making 1964 the most prosperous year ever and offering both the hope and expectation that 1965 will be even better .
