txt The Government took strong action yesterday to restrain " intensifying inflationary pressures " in the economy and thus protect the international position of the dollar . The Federal Reserve System , the nation 's central bank , increased its basic lending rate , called the discount rate , to 51/2 per cent from 3 per cent . The increase , effective this morning at the Federal Reserve Banks of New York , Philadelphia and Minneapolis , was the second in little more than a month . The authorities also increased the interest rate that commercial banks are allowed to pay on time deposits of $100,000 or more to a new maximum of 6% per cent , effective today , from the previous ceiling of 51/2 per cent . Neither action will have any direct impact on the man in the street . Indirectly , however , the effects are certain to be widespread and probably painful . Cost of Credit ? Because the discount rate and the rate on large time deposits are basic in the money market , their increase will tend to push the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on large time ' deposits ( " C.D. 's " in banking jargon ) , which pay a fixed rate of interest for a fixed period of time , as an important source of lendable funds . Since banks will be able to pay more for money , they will be likely to charge more for it . The Federal Reserve clearly hopes that this will discourage both consumer and business spending . Homebuilding is likely to be hardest hit , since the traditional mortgage lenders ? savings banks and savings and loan associations will find it hard to attract funds . The Federal Reserve 's announcement was made in Washington shortly after 4 o'clock in the afternoon . This was too late in the day for major commercial banks to react to it formally . But there was little question last night that the banks would act practically at once to increase their prime rate , or minimum interest rate on loans to business , from its present level of 6 per cent . Even before the Federal Reserve acted , bankers were saying that a decision on the prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank New York Trust Company , which is one of the nation 's largest banks , said the increase probably would be to 61/2 per cent , effective Monday morning . Chicago 's largest bank , the Continental Illinois , said it would raise its rates on time deposits on a scale rising to 5 " 7/s per cent . As the impact of the Federal Reserve 's action ripples out through the money market , and thence through the economy , the cost of long-term corporate borrowing will go up , the cost of home mortgages will advance and ? in those cases where interest rates are not already pressing against legal ceilings  --  the cost of consumer loans may also rise . The upward spiral of interest rates has already carried the cost of credit to levels that in some cases have not been seen since the Civil War and in others since the nineteentwenties . The discount rate , for example , is not at its highest level since , the 6 per cent rate that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ( but not other reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1929 . A 61/2 per cent prime rate , if it materializes , would be the highest ever since the custom of an established minumum rate on business loans was accepted in the nineteen-thirties . The 61/4 per cent ceiling on time deposits , likewise , would set a new record . The key to the upward spiral in interest rates  --  and to the Federal Reserve action yesterday  --  lies in . the failure of Congress to take action to restrain the economy through higher taxes . According to figures announced Tuesday by the Commerce Department , the economy grew during the first quarter at an annual rate of better than 10 per cent  --  which is far in excess of its ability to increase its output of goods ' and services . Fully 40 per cent of the $20-billion " growth " in the economy in the first three months of the year simply represented higher prices , rather than an increase in the physical ' volume of output . Furthermore , there were strong signs that consumers ? who for more than a year have been saving an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on a buying spree . Retail sales have been picking up smartly . And " final sales "  --  the total output of goods and services , plus or minus any change in business inventories  --  increased at a pace even faster than over-all output . The money managers have been seriously concerned that if a spending binge gets under way , this could sharply increase the total of imports into the United States , which would tend to undermine the position of the dollar . Officials said last night that figures on the balance of trade ? the difference between imports and exports ? were " discouraging " for January and February and that there was no sign yet of any improvement , Although the Reserve 's discount rate action yesterday applied only to three of the 32 regional Federal Reserve Banks , officials said the other nine would be likely to fall quickly into line with the 51h , per cent rate . 1/4 When the discount rate was raised last month to 5 per cent from 41/2 per cent , the Federal Reserve Bank of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its view that the increase should have been a full point , to the 51/2 per cent that will be posted this morning . In detail , the increase in time deposit rates  --  which applies to member banks of the Federal Reserve System as well as to banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ? is as follows : Deposits of 30 to 59 days ' maturity remain at a ceiling of 5% per cent . Deposits of 60 to 89 days ' maturity will have a ceiling of 5N per cent , deposits of 90 to 179 days ' maturity a ' 6 per cent maximum and those of 180 days or longer 61/4 per cent . No change was made in ceilings on consumer-type deposits , which range between 4 per cent and 5 per cent , depending on the type of account . Five members of the Federal Reserve Board voted for the actions taken yesterday . The other two members of the seven-man board were reported to be " absent and not voting . " Those who voted for the increases were the chairman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. Robertson and members George W. Mitchell , J. Dewey Mane and Andrew F. Brimmer . Those absent were Sherman J. Maisel and William W. Sherrill.
