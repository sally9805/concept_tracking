A person hardly expects the arrival of 460 Anglican clergymen to signal wholesale whoopee . But judging from the Lambeth ' 68 guidebook , printed to help the bishops when they met last week for their decennial conference in London , somebody expects the old boys to kick up their heels a bit . In the section on where to eat , the Barque and Bite was highly recommended because " you get a sherry on the house while you study the menu . " Chez Solange came out as " very , very French " with " ludicrously large helpings , noisy French neighbors and good carafe wine . " L'Etoile was billed as " one of the most expensive , " but the guide suggested that the bishops " get someone to take you . " A few episcopal frowns , of course , were directed at the whole idea . Said the Rt . Rev. Oliver S. Tomkins , 60 , Bishop of Bristol : " If there are some visiting bishops who can afford to turn their spare time into such an expensive spree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves how to do it . " <P> Dean Martin and Elke Sommer have locked up star billing in House of Seven Joys , Columbia 's new Matt Helm thriller . Yet one supporting role is sure to set the audience buzzing . That 's when an aide informs the President that thieves have made off with $1 billion in gold bullion . And there 's old L.B.J. listening to the bad news . Old who ? Well , it 's not quite the boss himself , folks . It 's his cousin . To play the President , Central Casting tapped J. B. Peck , 66 , retired sheriff of Garland , Texas , and L.B.J. 's somewhat look-alike first cousin . It 's just a flash of his pan , and J.B. got a kick out of it all . But then , considering the relatively short-term market for his kind of role , he headed back to his job as security guard for the Dallas Cowboys football team . <P> <P> When the Norwegian shipping tycoon first showed his bride , a lover of 19th century art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one horrified look at the wealth of modern art hanging on the walls and gasped : " It 's a nice place , but get rid of those terrible paintings ! " Twelve years later , Sonja Henie , 55 , is finally getting that wish . She and her husband Niels Onstad are giving Oslo an $8 million gallery to be stocked with more than 200 paintings from their world-famed collection of moderns . But the parting , it turns out , is sweet sorrow for Sonja , who has become an avid modernist . Ah well , they still have 50 paintings left for themselves and all that wall space in their three homes to start filling up again . <P>
