As the big kill at Tay Ninh demonstrated , the arsenal of American weapons in Viet Nam is the deadliest ever developed for man-to-man combat . The U.S. infantryman in Viet Nam today shoulders six times the firepower of his Korean War counterpart ; behind him stand rank upon rank of mobile mortars and howitzers that can be called in by air as quickly as he needs them . Overhead hover helicopters bristling with machine guns , rockets and automatic grenade launchers ; above the " gunships " circle jet fighter-bombers armed with searing napalm , white phosphorous and bomblets that can unleash deadly patterns of tiny steel pellets . In no other war has American weaponry so quickly matched the demands of a difficult tactical terrain . From the swamps of the Mekong Delta , where 30-ft. patrol boats packed with unsinkable plastic foam whisk along on water jets , to the shell-pocked " Rockpile " below the Demilitarized Zone , where six-barreled Ontos tracked vehicles rumble , the arsenal last week was in awesome action . <P> Bloody Mush . Basic element in this lethal complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifle " - the light , fast-firing , plastic-stocked M-16 automatic rifle carried by most of the combat troops in South Viet Nam . At 7.6 lbs. , the M-16 is scarcely the size of a farm boy 's " varmint " rifle ; yet it can spray short bursts at the rate of 750 rounds per minute , though reloading time cuts the effective rate to a far lower figure . Its muzzle velocity is so great that within 100 yds. - the range of most Viet Nam fire fights-an M-16 bullet generates supersonic shock waves that can collapse internal organs into bloody mush , shatter bone or leave arms and legs dangling drunkenly . <P> The M-16 does have drawbacks . Its lightweight , plastic butt is liable to shatter in hand-to-hand combat , where the infantryman often clobbers his enemy with the stock . Moreover , its high sight - necessitated by the carrying handle that serves as the rear sighting plane-means that a dug-in rifleman must expose his head and chest to aim carefully . But the rapid rate of fire more than compensates : in Korea with the slow-firing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons in battle ; in Viet Nam with the M16 , everyone fires copiously . Many riflemen lug 600 rounds into battle ( v. 72 rounds per man in Korea ) . <P> Knockout Punch . Behind the rapid-fire left jabs of its M16s , the infantry squad carries a knockout punch in the blunderbuss-shaped M-79 grenade launcher . " Beautiful little seventy-niners , " the Marines call them , particularly when a 40-mm. grenade-spring-loaded with half-inch steel barbs - pops in the middle of a Viet Cong position 385 yds. away . The M-79 has two drawbacks : it is only a single-shot weapon ( good grenadiers get off 16 rounds per minute ) , and its grenades are armed only after a flight of 30 meters through the air-in order to protect the grenadier from their fragments . A multishot M-79 is currently being tested in Viet Nam , and to solve the problem of close-in fire fights grenadiers are now issued 40-mm. " cannister " rounds whose heavy loads of Double-O buckshot blast out of the barrel as if from a sawed-off shotgun , cutting down everything within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says one veteran , " you 'd take down the skeet tower too .
