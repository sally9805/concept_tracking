" Ashley could not speak . He pointed to his throat . He unbuttoned his collar . " Open your mouth , Don Jaime ! " Mrs. Wickersham looked into his mouth , gave a moan , and recoiled with horror . " All the saints in heaven defend us ! " She whispered two words to Captain Rui , who blanched and crossed himself . She called into the hall  --  " Tomas ! Run at once to Dr.p202Martinez ! Tell him to come here !  --  Get up off the ground , Mr. Bristow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ' coffee bin ' ! " Ashley was borne through the streets and left in the shed for desperate cases . At noon all was over . The chapel bell tolled ; the blind girls asked to be led in prayer ; the sisters could scarcely find their way among the beds . At noon Mrs. Wickersham visited the shed . He must have some " papers " for his new life . She brought a collection of old and new birth certificates , citizenship papers , and passports . They had been assembled from undertakers ' offices , from innkeepers , and even from pawnbrokers . They described men of all ages , and sorts  --  men with twelve teeth missing , with scars on their backs and moles on their chests , with hernias and hemorrhoids and cloven palates . She brought also some penknives , bottles of ink and of acid . Ashley was in his element . They experimented with various forms of erasure , alteration , and clerical penmanship . Finally , they produced a certificate  --  stained by weather and perspiration , barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santiago de Chile , on March 7 or 9 , 1862 , blue eyes , brown hair , medium height , sound teeth , bearing a scar on his right jaw , bachelor , field worker . " At midnight she returned with an old man Esteban and five mules . His journey was to Tiburones . The road was over two hundred miles  --  one hundred and twenty , as the bird flies , if a bird had ever flown it . Few drops of rain fell on it in a century . It crossed old nitrate beds that had been abandoned since the railroadwas built . It was said to be haunted by the ghosts of the many fugitives who had died there . Water bags hung from the mules like great wasps ' nests ; hay was piled on their backs . There was bread , fruit , and wine for the men . Esteban held a second wide-brimmed hat like his own . " Well , get along with you , " she said . Ashley stood looking in silence at the grey eyes in the redp203face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a silk scarf out of her handbag . " This is wet . Tie it about your fore-head . " He gave her an envelope . " Put that in the jar for the Roentgen-ray machine . " Silence . " I 'll let Mr. Bristow out for a few hours . He enjoys funerals so .  --  Mr. Tolland , did you ever hear of the English poet John Keats ? " " I 've heard of him . " " He said that life is a vale of soul-making . ' He might have added that it 's a vale of soul-unmaking , ' too . We go up or we go down  --  forward or back . I was slipping back . Maybe I have a few years more . A few stones for a little Atenas . Write me . I 'll write you and tell you how we 're getting on .  --  Start off , Esteban ! " Ashley took her right hand and kissed the back of it slowly . The leave-takings of the children of faith are like first recognitions . Time does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endings . Twelve days later Esteban returned to Manantiales by the new road . He brought Mrs. Wickersham a letter from Carlos Cespedes . The hay and water for the mules had been barely sufficient . Several weeks later she received another by slow coastal mail . He was leaving Tiburones the next day for the north . She received no more . He was drowned at sea . No announcement of the capture of John Ashley of Coaltownever appeared or of his death and burial . Wellington Bristowwas able to persuade the consular agent that there was somethingsuspicious  --  " very fishy "  --  about Mrs. Wickersham 's claims to have buried the notorious fugitive . Mr. Bristow continued to search for him for years.  |p207When  , toward 1911 , persons all over the country began asking questions about the Ashley family , it was Roger who puzzled them most . They were unable to discover any one mainspring that releasedand directed his energy . He exhibited no signs of ambition ; he effaced himself , unsuccessfully . After the age of twenty-one he never signed an editorial in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoning to others . He held strong views , but he was not combative . Readers recognized his voice  --  reasonable without being argumentative , earnest without being ponderous , and always brief . It was the voice of ethical persuasion . Finally his admirers and enemies found relief in the formula that he was " old-fashioned . " He seemed to speak for the America of one 's grandparents  --  of that age before the great city imposed itself . It was old-fashioned of him also to revive the art of platform eloquence . Up to the beginning of this century Americans had rejoiced in a passion for oratory  --  sitting rapt for hours in tents and halls and churches . In addition to the beautiful speaking voice they had inherited from their mother , Roger and Constance possessed that rarer form of eloquence that arises from an absence of self-consciousness . Roger consented to speak onlyp208on great occasions and on grave issues , yet never for longer than thirty minutes . The First World War was imminent . His views often ran counter to those of his readers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defaced and the windows broken ; he was burned in effigy here and there ; but  --  unlike his sister Constance he was seldom insulted and reviled by members of his audience . He was old-fashioned , countrified , a little ridiculous , and compelling . Roger Ashley was seventeen and a half when  --  on foot  --  he entered Chicago . He was hungry , tired , dirty , unsmiling , and resolute . He looked very much a rustic and was taken to be sixteen , but he did not know this . His blue suit , which he had outgrown , shone here and there , like a mirror . Under his arm he carried a few articles of clothing wrapped in brown paper . Like his father before him he had been the young lord of a small town . He had led all his classes and captained all his teams . He had never known fear or self-consciousness . He had leapt at runaway horses , parted fighting dogs , and rushed into burning houses as though he had been singled out to do so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he was eleven and was strong . Chicago was growing fast . It was not hard to find work , poorly paid though it was . He was free to choose and he changed jobs often . First he had to eat . Lodging was of less importance . In summera man can sleep in parks and under bridges . Next , he had to earn money to send his mother . Above all he had to select his lifework . Sometimes he went for days with little to eat ; sometimeshe deliberately took less remunerative jobs , though it reducedthe sums he sent to Coaltown ; but he never ceased to search for his life 's career  --  to explore , observe , weigh , and eliminate the professions . He did n't want to waste any years on a wrong choice and he wanted to start preparing himself as soon as possible . Two other important tasks lay before him , but he was notp209aware of them . He must acquire an education . He must reconcile himself to the human community . He thought that education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that the dark resentmentthat filled his mind and heart was the normal armor of a man who has emerged from the thoughtlessness of boyhood . Many years later Dr. Gillies said : " Roger Ashley entered Chicago stump-ignorant . Fifteen years later , without having put foot in a classroom , he was the best-educated man in the country . Of course , he had some advantages over the rest of us . Socially , he was a pariah . Philosophically , he had just suffered the spectacle of his family being chewed up fine by a civilized Christian community . Economically , he owned nothing  --  he did n't even have an extra pair of shoes to pawn . Academically , he had never faced a professor . " There were a number of other advantages that Dr. Gillies failed to note . Roger possessed little sense of humor . There was no secondRoger lodged within his head . A sense of humor judges one'sactions and the actions of others from a wider reference and alonger view and finds them incongruous . It dampens enthusiasm ; it mocks hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderation . This wider reference and longer vieware not the gifts of any extraordinary wisdom ; they are merelythe condensed opinion of a given community at a given moment . Roger was a very serious young man . Further advantages and disadvantageswill come to our attention in the course of this history . Since he entered the city hungry he immediately sought workin restaurants . He began earning his living at the bottom of theladder of all employment ; he washed dishes . There is somethingcomical about low tasks being performed not only adequately butto perfection . Roger knew no better , having no sense of humor . The Ashleys gave all of themselves to whatever task was set before them . He was silent without being sullen , industrious withoutbeing aggressive , and , like his father , he was inventive . He grad/ually instituted procedures that made for speed , efficiency , and economy . The first thing he did was to place wooden boxes in the washing troughs . All the dishwashers were getting bent backs , stiff necks , chest pains , and murderous rages from leaning over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was called into the kitchen to supervise the mechanics of delivering and removing plates . The restaurant , like Chicago , had grown too fast . In no time he was all over the place . His name was constantly in the air , " Trent , Trent ! Wo ist der verfluchte Kerl ? " " Trent ! How can I work if there 's no goddamned fish here ? " He was blamed for everything that went wrong , but he had a calming effect on the irritability of cooks and waiters . They cursed him during those terrible hours from noon to three and from six to nine , but when they themselves sat down to eat they heaped his plate . Emergencies arose and his work carried him into the dining rooms . He reorganized service tables and sideboards . His wages were raised once , but raises are not readily given to the silent and the undemanding . He left the restaurant at the end of three months . " Resigned " is too grand a word for those who receive seventy cents a day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt there was something infantile about it . Besides , he was looking about for a night job that would give him an opportunity to explore Chicago by day . It would also , after a short rest , enable him to get work by day as well . " The Elms " needed money and he needed a new pair of pants . Sleep is for sloths . His fellow workers at the restaurant were aghast and even wept , but he left without regret . Everybodyliked him and he liked no one . He applied for the position of night clerk in a hotel . He was turned away from the better hotels because of his youthful appearanceand his rusticity . Finally , he was given the night shift at the Carr-Bingham . He earned less money , but he was allowed to sleep in the trunk room under the eaves . He made himself tea at sunrise . He ate once a day , standing up . In any one of a dozen German saloons in the neighborhood he could help himself , forp211the price of a beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheese , and pickles . The Carr-Bingham was a fourth-rate hotel . In sixth-rate hotels all is misery and vice ; in a fourth-rate one there is a grain of effort and a wisp of hope . Those who are silent , self-effacing , and attentive become the recipients of confidences . He heard many life stories between ten at night and eight in the morning . From every side there was brought home to him a thing that had never come to his attention , except in the matter of Goshen : the importance of money to self-respect and , above all , to independence . It was during his first days at the Carr-Bingham that he received the letter from Sophia telling of the boardinghouseat " The Elms , " about Mrs. Guilfoyle , Brother Jorgenson , and the high school teacher . He promptly went out and found a daytime job . Almost nightly one or other of the guests tried to borrow money from him . " Just fifty cents , Trent  --  that 's a good fellow , " " I 'll pay you back tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he knew no greater need than his own . He appropriateda pair of shoes from the belongings of an absconding guest . He was often called upon to put drunkards to bed . On two occasionshe pocketed the dollar bill or loose change that these late revelers dropped behind them on the stairs . Money , he felt , was for those who needed it . It 's a spiritless son and breadwinner who does not write his own morality . He reflected further on the matter , however , when two of his three shirts , then some money , were stolen from him . Long before he left the Carr-Bingham he decided that he would not become a hotel man . He had known a home . Night after night he was aware of the guests  --  the querulousbreathing , the abrupt awakenings , the unrestorative sleep of the homeless . Dr. Gillies 's letter of recommendation was useful . He sold haberdashery all day , standing behind a narrow counter . He left the position after three weeks in order to catch up with sleep . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not accept . He sorted cheques all day , seated at ap212table in a bank . He became a messenger in a law firm , an interofficerunner  --  the job was called that of " Indian . " He extended and even created his own usefulness . Everywhere he observed , weighed , explored , and eliminated the professions . He watched the chiefs  --  their hands and eyes , their relations with their subordinates , their greetings on arrival and departure . Roger had never attended a theatre , but he had played King Herod and Ahasuerus in Sunday-school pageants , and he knew that the importantthing in acting is not to be natural . Apparently the more important a businessman became the more he " acted . " These men did not greet their associates in the morning ; they " acted " greeting their associates in the morning . Their very smiles and frowns and clearings of the throat were calculated to convey that they were important , busy , and short of temper . It was apparentthat they were somehow afraid  --  afraid of a non-acted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deformation induced by the sedentary life  --  the revolt of the body against the long day in the swivel chair , the sagging cheek , the paunch , the increasing fatigue in the afternoon , the strained breathing , the mounting irritation , the soda tablets , and the spittoon . Roger seldom thought of his father , but his father was serving him as the measure of a man . He had never known him to be for one moment guilty of acting . These merchants and bankers and lawyers , he asked himself , did they present a different self to their wives and children ? Did they " act " being husbands and fathers ? Of course , they did . He 'd seen that often in Coaltown  --  Joel Miller 's father and George Lansing 's father , the great and late Breckenridge Lansing . John Ashley had begun the day singingloudly before his shaving mirror . He raised a joyful storm in the house . " Bathroom 's free , little doggies ! Last one to breakfastis a buffalo . " His son was certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Ashley had driven away to his office with delight and , arrived on the hill , had divided his time between office , workshop , company store , infirmary , and the shafts . Rogerp213resolved that he would never follow a career that involved sitting down all day . In addition he gathered , in some obscure way , that a large part of all this " acting " was an attempt to make the operationsof business appear more difficult than they were . Diversity of experience does not in itself constitute an education , though the boast is often heard that it does . Contact with the suffering of others does not in itself enlarge understanding . Luck must play a part . Roger was overwhelmed by the crowds of Chicago . He was oppressed by the multiplicity of human beings . On the way to work he would stop and gaze at the throngs on LaSalle Street . ( During his first days he thought he was seeing the same persons walking back and forth . ) All these men and women had souls , had " selves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to himself . In seventy years everyone he was looking at  --  and himself  --  wouldbe dead , except a few old freaks . There 'd be a whole new million hurrying and worrying and laughing and talking . " Get out of my way . I do n't know you . I 'm busy living . " " Mr. Joch said that Peking in China was eight times as big as Chicago . Crowds make you think of death ; death makes you think of crowds . . . . Nobody asked me if I wanted to be born . Trapped into life . . . Cemeteries must be awfully crowded : Did you enjoy your trip , son ? ' Was it a pleasant visit , ma'am ? ' .. . Chicago 's like a big clockshop  --  all those little hammers going . In the street people put on a face so that strangers wo n't read their souls . A crowd is a sterner judge than a relative or a friend . The crowd is God . LaSalle Street is like hell  --  you 're being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logical . In Old Quarry Pond there were millions of minnows . Mr. Marden said that fish ate their own eggs when there were too many . War  --  not enough food to go round . " Crowds make you think of money . Everybody has some money in his pocket . Metal and paper . Represents a certain amountp214of work and the quality of the work . Biggest lie under the sun . Mr. Joch telling me about the Pullman strike nine years ago ... . " Crowds make you think about how the sexes attract one another . On the street men 's eyes never quiet , every minute looking for a pretty girl . Women put blinkers on their faces ; look straight ahead . Pretend they do n't see anybody . Same thing . Pull of the sexes is like a carrot hanging in front of a donkey 's nose . Keeps up his interest . Like Shakespeare says , Lights fools the way to dusty death . ' .. . " Crowds make you think about religion . What did God mean by making so many ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . I do n't know where to begin . Probably just a carrot in front of your nose . Makes people feel important . Maybe Papa 's dead . But he 's not dead for Sophie and me . He 's alive in us even when we are n't thinking about him . " Imagination means seeing through walls . And seeing through skulls . Eugene V. Debs in prison just a mile away . I wish I could be a fly on the wall and imagine what he thinks about people and cemeteries and lots of things . " At times he felt himself shrinking to a ghost , to a nobody cold , meaningless , and alone . To recover himself he placed Sophia beside him . " Look , Sophie ! Just look ! " He decided to appraise a life in medicine . Without presentingDr . Gillies 's letter he applied at a hospital for work as an orderly and was engaged at once . The pay was as low as the dishwasher 's , but he was given his meals and a cot in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pails of flesh . He fainted once , as did the nurse beside him . He washed the moribund and held the aged and broken in his arms while the nurses changed the sheets under them . He had never been ill and prior to his arrival at the Carr-Bingham he had seen very little illness . The examples of it he had seen there were obviously the result of mistakes and general foolishness . It was some time before he was able to free himself of this assumption . Here , too , he was silent ,  |p215willing  , and tireless . The nurses came to take it for granted that he was always on duty . There is something comical , you remember , about performing a low job perfectly . This servant had no sense of proportion . In the wards after " lights out " he would return several times during the night to tend Mr. Kegan 's fistula or the unhappy Barry Hotchkiss 's strangulated hernia . His devotion to duty was mistaken for sympathy . He neglected nothing ; he forgot nothing . In previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goings were followed with love . He loved no one . When he hastened silently between the beds at three in the morning whispersarose  --  as on some battlefield after a hard=fought defeat  --  " Trent ! Trent ! " He was much in demand as a letter writer . ( " I have only time for about twenty words , Mr. Watson . " " You alreadyowe me for three stamps , Judge . " ) He was occasionally called into the women 's wards . Mrs. Rosenzweig clutched his hand and said softly , " You are a good boy . God will reward you . " Roger wanted none of God 's recompenses . He wanted twenty dollars to send his mother . Every month that passed saw a reduction in the number of things that could surprise him . His contacts with his fellow orderliesenlarged his experience . Dr. Gillies had refrained from telling him that they were drawn from among the all but unemployable  --  menfresh from prison or absent without leave from their country 's armed forces , unfrocked priests , epileptics , pyromaniacs under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dolls ' clothing , weight lifters , and world reformers . The vast room was seldom quiet , for the orderlies worked in staggered shifts . Roger slept with cotton in his ears , only ostensibly because of the noise  --  he could have slept through battles and cyclones  --  but because of the conversation . The presence of woman obsessed the dormitory at all hours , resembling a cloud of gnats , invoked and repelled in cackles , guffaws , yelps , and long feverish stories . The practice of stuffing his ears with cotton he adopted fromp216Clem , the oldest of the orderlies . Clem spent the larger part of his free time reading ; he would have spent all of it so but for his failing eyesight . For every half hour he read he sat for a half hour with his hands covering his eyes in a pose that suggested prayer or desperation . He was a philosopher . In the limited space available to lim in one corner of the dormitory he had built a hermit 's cell about his bed , made from packing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's HCHO " walls and bookshelves . Many of the books were in Latin or in an English as impenetrable as Latin ; some were in French and German : SPINOZA . . . DESCARTES . . . PLOTINUS . Hence the cotton in his ears . Roger 's eyes often rested speculatively on Clem 's lowered sound-proof head . Most of the patients left the hospital shaken , but cured . Roger received many gifts  --  cigars , religious medals , postcards of Chicago 's waterfront , suspenders , pocket combs , grocers ' calendars . ( " Goodbye , Trent boy , thanks a lot , " " Goodbye , Trent , you 've been awful good to my husband . Now do n't forget what I said : we have a room for you in our house , if ever you need it . " ) He was loved and he loved no one . But Roger had much to do with death . He had made a resolve not to put to himself the questions that inevitably arise from a frequent contact with death , but certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering on a difficult or protracted death he was lifted onto a wheeled table and rolled into a room reserved for the dying . The orderlies had an ugly name for this room that Roger never used . Priests came in and out . Relatives were permitted to stand a moment at the door . Orderlies were in the custom of dropping in and lighting a pipe . Conversation was not easy , what with all the whistling and rattling going on . Over half the patients called for their mothers  --  even men who appeared to be nearing a hundred . ( A man 's first and last words are easy to say ; that In recurs in all languages . ) A bowl of filed-doyen pennies stood on a shelf . Roger came to recognize fairly well the momentp217of death . He watched with wonder . He liked the words " gave up the ghost . " ( Query : where does it go ? ) He could look steadily into the eyes of his older patients . He averted his eyes from the young men . From time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just eighteen . He would wait until nightfall , hoping for clear weather . In clear weather he would carry an armful of blankets to the roof of the hospital , clear away the snow , and lie down with his face to the sky . From the gorge in Coaltown one saw only a narrow portion of the heavens . It gave him a restful feeling to think that God who had made so many people had made so many stars , too . There was probably some connection . They were shining down on " The Elms " and maybe on his father , millions of them . He was becoming reconciled to the disturbing discovery of the human multitude . Against his will his thoughts returned often to a puzzling rigmarole told him by one of his fellow orderlies . Peter Bogardus had been a barber , but had given up the work because he was nervous ; he could n't handle knives . He was pockmarked and totally bald . He did n't drink , but he had bad habits . He was a better orderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . ( " Quick as a fox in a crisis , " said Chief Nurse Bergstrom . " He saves twenty lives a year . " ) He belonged to an association that made a study of the life after death and ghosts . He invited Roger to attend a meeting , but Roger refused ; he was afraid he would be charged admission . Besides , he assimilated what he wanted from Peter Bogardus , free . One late morning they were idling in the room for the dying . Roger often dropped in there to see how things were going . He 'd accompanied many a patient along the road . The other orderlies noticed that he had a sort of gift for quieting the patients just before they " kicked the bucket . " ( " Trent , why do you always pick up the old geezers ' hands ? " " I do n't know . Do I ? I think maybe they like it . " ) It was Bogardus 's day on duty there . He walked back andp218forth smoking long brown cigarettes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pennies . " Trent , " he said , " all men lead as many lives as there are sands in the Ganges River . " Roger waited . Finally he had to ask , " What do you mean , Pete ? " " We are born again and again . These three men here  --  look at them ! " Roger did n't have to look at what he had seen so often  --  the half-open suppliant eyes , the trembling chins and cheeks . " They will be dead in a few hours . But forty-nine days from now  --  seven sevens !  --  they will be born again . And they will be born again hundreds of thousands of times . " Roger remembered hearing something about this ridiculous idea before . In Coaltown his father had put money in the collectionplate at church to send missionaries across the ocean to rid ignorant people of just such notions as that . But Roger was readier than he had been to listen to old and new ideas ; Coaltown had some pretty ridiculous ones of its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In each new life a man may acquire merit that will permit him to step up a rung or two , or he may fall into error and slip back . Through the merit of Gautama Buddha himself and those who have followed him all men tend to rise . Finally , when they have lived as many lives as the sands of the Ganges , they will arrive at the threshold of supreme happiness . But  --  now mark my words !  --  arrived at that threshold , these men will not step over it . They will deny themselvessupreme happiness . They will continue to be reborn . They will choose to wait until all men have reached that threshold  --  men as numerous as the sands of the Ganges  --  many of them cruel and wicked men . They move about among us now , in disguise , aiding us to ascend that mighty ladder . But even when all the men on this earth , as many as are the sands of the Ganges , have reached that threshold none of them will step over it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many asp219the sands of the Ganges . We must wait until all the men on all the stars have purified themselves . No man can wish to be happy until everyone else in the universe is happy . " Roger stared at him , uncomprehendingly . His family had been happy at " The Elms . " Peter went on : " You can see that great staircase , Trent  --  that mighty staircase ? Can you count all those human beings on it ? Sometimes you can see a little flutter  --  someone has mounted four steps  --  Socratesor Mrs. Besant or Tom Paine or Abraham Lincoln . Sometimesthere 's a moment of confusion  --  looks like an avalanche in the Rockies  --  a man  --  a Nero or a millionaire  --  has tumbled and lost fifty or a thousand of his lives . None ever stands still . " He continued to walk to and fro smoking his long brown cigarette . Suddenly he turned and shouted , " Free yourself of attachments ! Wife and child  --  illusions ! Your reputation among men , your honor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some men , at the moment of death , are given for half a second a memory of their former existences  --  a glimpse of their future existences . Boy , they lean for half a second over the vast abyss of time and see the long wretchedness of their past lives . Others look up and see the threshold in the far distance above them . They can see that somedaythere will be an end to living in this sorrowful world , this vale of tears . " Roger started . He had seen those lightning-quick returns to consciousness  --  those expressions of immeasurable horror , those visions of all consolation . Bogardus crossed and leaned toward him , lowering his voice . " Trent , know this : there is a limit even to the number of the sands of the Ganges . We shall be Buddhas when the last earthbound man and the last starbound man has sprung free . " Peter 's agitation had communicated itself to two of the patients . " Judge " Bartlett 's eyes were rolling imploringly from side to side . Roger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanket ; he understood the guttural noises from his throat.  |p220He  crossed the room and wiped the patient 's mouth with a towel . He shouted , " I ca n't write a letter now , Judge . I have n't got a pencil . I 'll do it tomorrow . Go to sleep . Yes , go to sleep . Get some rest . " There was the suggestion of a handshake . On another table a patient mutters . " Hab kei Gelt . . . . Mutti . ... Hil f ' .... Lu. . . . u . . . u . . . ft . " " Allen gut , Herr Metzger ! " cried Roger . " Schlaf a bissl ! Ja ! " Peter Bogardus continued : " You Christians ca n't wait that long  --  no , siree . You want your supreme happiness next Tuesday . You ca n't wait ten billion billion years that 's Christ 's fault impatience ; always announcing the end of the world , next week , next month . And Christianity inherited his impatience  --  kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or burn ' em ! Believe in me or go to hell . That 's what hell is  --  impatience . " He wiped the perspiration from his forehead . " Look at me  --  getting excited ! Look at me  --  attached to trying to make you understand something . Why should I care whether a little peanut like you in Chicago , Illinois , learns anything ? That 's the damnable impatience I acquired when I was a Christian . Look at me  --  trembling ! " He sat down on the floor , cross-legged . " I must do my breathingexercises and calm myself . No ! I 'd better stand on my head . That 's best . " Peter flung his heels to the ceiling . Roger was accustomed to this . He was still thinking about the ladder of rebirth . " You do n't really believe that , do you , Peter ? " Peter , upside down , rested his pale watery eyes on Roger and waited . " Never ask a man what he believes . Watch what he uses . ' Believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A new patient , purple of face , was rolled in . " Hello , Trent . Hello , Pete , " said the orderly . " Hello , Herb . " " Y'know him ? " " Yes , " said Roger . " First name 's Nick . Night watchman in the Fletcher Building . "  |p221He  had come to know Nick well , having served and washed him for weeks . If there was anything in the Great Ladder idea , Nick was high up , high up . Roger had never seen a patient who so made himself at home  --  so to speak  --  in the hospital and in his pain . Though dependent upon others for humiliating aid , though his bed stood among those of noisy , foul-mouthed , furious sufferers , he gazed tranquilly at the ceiling . A stag would die so . He asked for nothing . When Roger offered to write a letter for him , he dictated some words to his daughter in Boston , requestingonly that the letter be mailed a week after his burial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body under the ground when he was freed of it . Roger turned his chair and sat with his back to Old Nick . Nick would not wish a friend to witnesshis animal struggles ; they were not important . And suddenly it came to Roger that his father , too , was high , high up . Throughoutthat long trial in Coaltown  --  the " Hyena trial "  --  his father had conducted himself just so : out of reach of curiosity and malice and to all appearances at home in the courtroom and his extremity . Roger went out of the door and out of the building . He stood in the sunlight at the hospital 's rear entrance , shivering in his white suit . He had no questions to put to his father . He had no wish to sit down at a table and talk with him ; but Roger would have given much of the little he possessed to see him pass along the street . He would have followed him for blocks simply to rest his eyes on someone who was so high up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someday he  --  Roger  --  would have children of his own . He would leave them behind him . He would die . He was being drawn to the human community by thoughts of the dying , the banished , and the unborn . It was from another aspect of his family 's slowness to mature that Roger suffered crushingly from homesickness . A glimpse ofp222a woman in the distance would evoke his mother ; an object , a girl 's voice , a smell would recall " The Elms . " Everything would go dark before his eyes . He would be obliged to put out his hand to a lamp-post or a wall and to wait until the pain subsided . From time to time , in order to suffer more intensely  --  that is to embrace " The Elms " more passionately  --  he went to the railway station from which trains departed for Coaltown . The station was near the lake . He had never seen a body of standing water larger than a pond . The view of those innumerable waves calmed him . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the thousands of years that have gone by , I bet there must have been a lot of fellows my age who had to leave their homes for one reason or another  --  like going to war , for instance . " Questions , the torment of questions . There is no true education save in answer to urgent questioning . Unease and deprivation awaken the young mind to inquiry . Roger did not realize that he and his sisters had acquired that habit of mind in their earliest years : they had struggled to survive . Like plants in a parched soil , they had sent down deep roots . From infancy they had groped hither and thither , asking " What ? " and " why ? " and " how ? " Beata Ashley was an admirable mother ; she gave her children much ; she gave them everything except the essential . As we have seen ( and as a result of a starvationin her own childhood ) she must love only one human being . John Ashley could give his children the essential  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his imaginationwas still to come . The children did not turn in on themselves . They were saved from fruitless introspection by their father 's joy in them . Lily became the princess sleeping in the cave ; Sophia entered into her ministry to animals . Constance  --  knowing no mother  --  prepared herself for that extraordinary life in which she would see herself as the mother of millions , more than half of them older than herself . Roger barely escaped some obscurep223shipwreck . A puzzling event took place in the summer of 1891 . He was six and a half . He was well known in Coaltown as a model boy  --  so bright , so well behaved . His parents were out of the house . Seizing his youngest sister 's chair he broke five windows in the living room . He then ran away from home , weeping as from some unfathomable abandonment . He stopped only to pick up Sophia 's kitten to comfort him on his long walk to China . His parents tendered scarcely one word of rebuke . Roger never gave vent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The small adventurer and babbler became taciturn . He became a listener ( " what ? " " why ? " ) . The expression on his face varied little . He became the school 's best student and athlete . He was liked by everyone in town and ignored their liking . He had one friend , Porky . He accepted one person 's love , Sophia 's . He was strengthenedby confidence in his father and isolated by his passionate love for his mother . Questions . Questions . Now  --  like his father , thousands of miles away  --  he had no vocabulary and no grammar for reflection . What unity could be found in the increasing diversity of his existence : the catastrophe in Coaltown ; his mother walking beside him imperturbedly to the courthouse ; the mystery of his father 's rescue ; the noontime crowd on LaSalle Street ; the deaths he was witnessingdaily ; God 's responsibility for the suffering of children , horses , dogs , and cats ; Eugene V. Debs in prison scarcely a mile away ; his happiness when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow orderlies ' views on women ; his resoles to achieve a great lifework ? And the working world  --  injustice everywhere : employerscheated the workers ; workers cheated the employers and one another ? He 'd done some cheating himself . One day he stopped by Old Clem 's cell . " Clem , those books you 're reading  --  do students study them in college ? " " Yes , some of them . " " Did you go to college ? "  | " Yes , I did . " " What does a college education do for you ? " " It ties together the things you see . " Roger drew back as though he had been struck . " Can a person educate himself , Clem ? " " One in a million , maybe . " " Does most of an education come out of books ? " " A man who tried to understand anything without knowing THOSE BOOKS would just be a feathered kangaroo . Like Pete Bogardus . You 're wasting my time . " " Thank you , Clem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those colleges , or  --  for a time , at least to read any of those famous books . He had walkedthe streets of Chicago at all hours . He had listened to scores of life stories . Man is cruel to man and even those who are kind to those nearest them are inhuman to others . It 's not kindness that 's important but justice . Kindness is the stammering apology of the unjust . The whole world 's wrong , he saw . There 's something wrong at the heart of the world and he would track it down . Many of those books and colleges had been around for hundreds of years  --  with very little effect . The few serious books he had looked into seemed windy , slow-moving , filled with padding  --  like political addresses and sermons . Like all Ashleys , he wanted no help . We shall see later how his father " invented " marriage and paternity . Roger wanted to invent the explanation for existence and the rules whereby men could live rationally side by side to be the first philosopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind ( most men boast of possessing it ) can not rest . Roger had already entered on this great task . His head was full of notions and he was driven to write them down . At the Carr-Bingham Hotel he had collected wastepaper . During the long nights there , and later at the hospital , he wrote thousands and thousands of words on the backs of oldaccount books , bills , announcements , and calendars notions . Hep225had never had a friend of his own age , except Porky , even more taciturn than himself . He had never , like other young men , built and unbuilt God , society , morals in conversation . He now drew up an explanation of the nature of things ; he derived ethics from the order in the cosmos ; he designed the constitution of an ideal state . One day his feverish resort to writing came to an end as abruptly as it had begun . He carried the armfuls of scrap paper to the incinerator . He had come to a dead end , not in discouragementbut as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew nothing and that he was ill equipped to learn , but that learning was possible . He was ripe for reading . We shall see how he enteredreading by the back door . After three months of hospital life Roger returned to the CarrBinghamHotel , promoted to day clerk . He was anxious to make more money and he had arrived at a conclusion about medicine . He had become aware of that never-ending line  --  from the beginning of time to the end of time  --  of patients waiting at the door . No bed was empty for longer than three hours . To his eyes medicineappeared to be a business of patch and shore and bolster  --  the temporary repair of unsalvageable vessels . He was an ignorant country boy ; he had no idea that medicine could take a different view of itself . Back at the hotel Roger came into closer contact with a group of newspaper reporters who shared a row of cubicle-like rooms on the top floor near his own . This corridor had long since lost its institutional uniformity . Most of the doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The management had prudently replaced the chairs with benches and packing cases . For men without women a cave is sufficient . A smell of gin , lemon peel , mash , cubebs , and medication filled the air . The men seldom ate , slept , washed , or fell silent . They were ill paid and only intermittently ambitious , but they were convinced that they belonged to the greatest profession inp226the world . They knew everything ; all men except themselves were the dupes of appearances . They were privy to corruption in public office , the farce of philanthropy , the hypocrisy of the clergy , the wolves ' raids of big business especially of the railroads and of the stockyards . They were rich in all the knowledge they were not permitted to print . Knowledge , like courage and virtue , isolates a man ; they were thrown back on one another 's company . Barred from publishing what they knew , they were driven to seek out some other mode of expression : they were conversationalists . Conversation was their brightly lighted stage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massacres . Day by day and night by night they strove for the palm of the unparalleled jest , the supreme verbal acrobacy . Under the guise of comradeship they flayed one another . They rifled the dictionaries for words and images of intoxicating precision ; they demanded ever stronger accents from blasphemy and obscenity . They were untalented reportersbecause their ambitions lay elsewhere ; they were conversationalists . Roger listened . They were quick-witted ; they had a wide if heterogeneous field of information . Above all they had a point of view : the abject condition of man and the futility of his efforts to improve himself . Any confrontation with fortitude , heroism , piety , or even dignity rendered them uncomfortable . They prided themselves on being impressed by nothing . Any impulse toward admiration or compassion they promptly converted into ribaldry and persiflage . Several of these reporters had been present at the Coaltown trial and recognized the hotel clerk . They handled him roughly about it for a while , then forgot it . They could not take him seriously . He was a country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ears . Roger had two qualities , however , that recommended him to them . He was an attentive though unsmiling listener and he was reliable . Virtuosi stand in need of fresh audiences . " Old Trent listens with his eyes and ears and nose  --  damn it , he listens with his chin . " Dissipated men need one trustworthy friend . He becamep227their banker and their message center . " Keep this money for me until tomorrow , Trent . I do n't know what will be happening to me tonight . " " Tell Herb to keep out of sight . Gretchen 's looking for him . " " Tell Spider the caucus is at ten o'clock in St. Stephen 's Hall . " If journalism was the greatest profession in the world Roger resolved to look into it . He could not understand why reporters held all action and all human beings , except themselves , in contempt . He could not understand why , seeing corruption everywhere , they were not moved to report the whole of it . One afternoonSpider , returning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It contained scores of stories and editorials about the Ashley-Lansing case . During the trial the Ashleys read no papers . He now read these pages several times . He was astonished to see how accurately they reported the proceedings in the courthouse and yet how feeble and unfocused the editorial comment was , even when it inveighed against the verdict and the conduct of the trial . During a solemn midnight walk beside Lake Michigan Roger resolved to become a newspaperman . Years later Roger was able to acknowledge the extent of hisindebtedness to the group of reporters on the top floor of theCarr-Bingham : his introduction to journalism , to opera , to oneof those devil 's advocates that are so important in any education  --  that is , to the conversation of T. G. Speidel  --  and to reading . The reporters were readers , as time permitted . There weremany books to be found on the top floor of the Carr-BinghamHotel  --  under the beds , over the wardrobes , in the toilet andbroom cupboard , beside the mousetrap . Most of them were pocketsize  --  a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paperor of imitation leather . They bore such titles as The Wit and Wisdomof Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll , Great Thoughts from Plato , The Best Pages of Casanova , Nietzsche on Superstition , Tolstoyon Art , Nuggets from Goethe , Nuggets from Voltaire , Confuciuson The Center . Roger read them . He entered reading by the backp228door . He paid a visit to the Public Library , but was displeased with it . He began to haunt second-hand bookstores . Reading became for him a great adventure . He told no one of his rewards and of his defeats . Even before he arrived at his decision to become a journalist Roger learned that the profession enjoys an inestimable privilege : newspapermen can occasionally obtain free admission to the theatre . One evening a reporter gave him a ticket to the opera . He attended a performance of Fidelio . It was an overwhelming experience . He had endured much . He was at no time near to any breakingpoint , but he was starved of food for the spirit . It was time that he gazed on larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortitude from his own vitals , but the true food of valor is example . Before the Kangaheela braves went into battle they listened  --  eyes fixed on the distance  --  to songs that recalled the exploits of their ancestors . It was perhaps not incidental that on that occasion he followed the story of a woman who descended into a dungeon to rescue a husband unjustly condemned to death . A week later another opera offered him the spectacle of a young man who endured trials of fire and water to win the hand of the girl he loved . At the end of it the young man was received into the fellowship of the wise and the just . If operas were like that  --  if they concerned themselves with things that really mattered ( rendered all but unendurably convincing by such wonderful noise )  --  he must so arrange his life as to be constantly present at them . He persuaded his friends on the top floor of the hotel to find work for him on a newspaper . He became a " printer 's devil , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called there . His hands and face and apron were covered with ink . His ears were deafened by the presses . In a maze of iron staircases he rushed copy from the reporters to the editors . He rushed copy from the editors to thep229typesetters . He soon learned what was needed before it was called for ; he foresaw blockages ; he eased the recurring crises . The halls resounded with his name . " Trent ! Trent ! Where 's that damned Trent ? " " Trent , carry this poop downstairs and be quick about it . " A reporter , short of time between two stories , would thrust his notes on Roger : " Run it up ! And remember WHAT , WHO , WHERE , WHEN . " He was awaiting his opportunity and his opportunitycame . All the reporters were out on assignment . It was learned that a man had strangled a woman behind Heffernan 's Livery Stable . " Get that story and get it right ! Run ! " Another opportunity arose and another . In late August , 1903 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago thirteen months . He was eighteen years and eight months old . At last he was not only doing his duty and feeding his curiosity , he was making a thing . His youthful and countrified air enabled him to be present at occasions from which an older and more knowing man would have been thrown out . He stood against the wall at closed political meetings ; he slipped past the guards in the training quarters of boxing champions ; he re-entered his old hospital by the employees ' entrance and obtained a confession from a dying man . He arrived before the police and put questions to women who did not yet know that they were widows . He was taking notes at a Greek patriotic banquet in the Olympia Restaurant while the guests , stricken with food poisoning , lay about on the floor like brightly colored clothes bags . By December , 1903 , he was writing his sister , " I bet I know four hundred Chicagoans by names and faces . " Soon he was submitting special articles to the editor ; they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TRENT : " Chicagoans , Save Your Waterfront ! " " Know Your Polish Neighbors , " " The Swop Market on Wisconsin Avenue , " " Know Your Chinese Neighbors . " He sent them to Sophia . Notices would appear on the assignment board : " TF  --  500 words  --  Friday  --  Women 's interests . " The editor was bewildered by Roger 's contributionsand rejected half of them as unlikely to interest readers ,  |p230or  as capable of giving offense . When a new editor joined the paper , Roger resubmitted them . He was inventing a new kind of journalism . Readers began to keep scrapbooks of these pieces ; the offices of the newspaper were plagued with requests for old issues . He received a bonus of twenty-five cents for each . Here are some further titles . Sympathy was stirring ; he was beginning to see through walls and through skulls . " A Day at Hull House . " " A Child Goes to the Stockyards " ( twice rejected ) . " A Fourth-rate Hotel . " " The Statues in Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Trent " interviewed the last horse to have drawn a streetcar in Chicago . The concluding sentence read : " By the time these words have been set in print Bettina 's hoofs will have been bottled for glue . " ) " Seagoing Adventure . " ( The night boat to Milwaukee . ) " Know Your Hungarian Neighbors . " ( The " Ungaria Eterna Association " promptly sent him an invitation to a banquet in his honor which he courteously declined . ) " Kennels for Babies . " ( Twice rejected . Shocked readers canceledtheir subscriptions . ) " Pat Quiggan and II Trovatore . " ( A scene shifter at the auditorium gives his account of what takes place in the famous opera . Roger had little sense of humor , but an unerring ear . Truth is funnier than fiction . Like a number of the other puddings this was reprinted from coast to coast , much embellished . ) " A Pleasant Evening to You , Gentlemen . " ( A visit to the newly opened " St. Casimir 's Home for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Archbishop . ) " Milly and the Treadle . " ( A visit to a seamstresses ' sweatshop . A score of readers sent the author the text of a poem he had never read , " The Song of the Shirt . " ) " Who Are Chicago 's Seven Best Preachers ? " ( Three articles . Roger had unwittingly put his head into a hornets ' nest of sec/tarian enthusiasm and strife . For weeks he received from fifty to a hundred letters a day . ) " A Cap for Florence Nightingale . " ( October , 1905 . This was written in great trouble of mind to give pleasure to Sophia . Roger had just heard from Porky that she had been taken to the Bell Farm for rest . He wrote her every day , finally enclosing this " pudding " and announcing that he was returning to Coaltown for Christmas . The editor first refused this piece as too silly for print , whereupon Roger resigned , declaring that he would take his work to another paper . The editor relented . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his daughter being " capped " on graduation from a nurses ' training school in Chicago . The girl was named Sophia and had lived in a house in southern Illinois called " The Elms . " The father recalled his daughter 's love for animals , the splints she had made for squirrels and birds , the fledglings she had fed from an eye dropper . The author seemed to know a great deal about the duties , the trials , and the rewards of nursing . The piece was widely reprinted and brought many letters . A big cake was delivered to the newspaper office ; it had been baked by the sister at Misericordia Hospital who , they said , had long been praying for him . ) Roger had a rickety ink-stained table in the City Room , but was seldom there . There was a rumor in the city that he was the son of a famous criminal ; it was attributed to envious gossip . Rumor also said that he was under twenty , which was preposterous . It was generally believed that he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . He lived in a beautiful home in Winnetkaor Evanston , surrounded by a large family and many animals . Roger had a considerable acquaintance , however , among people who " worked , " to whom he was known as " that boy who writes those things in the paper . " He had made a number of enemies also , particularly in the sporting and political circles , and had had occasion to defend himself from violence . All this activity , to him , bore little resemblance to the lifework in journalism thatp232was forming in his mind . He was looking forward to inventing a journalism that had never been seen before . He was not impatient . He did not take these " puddings " seriously . Besides , their spelling and grammar were deplorable . He took the precaution of submitting them to old Mr. Brant of the green eyeshade , who prepared them for print . Roger studied and digested Mr. Brant 's emendations . In Chicago " Trent " was beginning to be famous , but those who have never wished for fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrives and scarcely know what to do with it . As far as he was concerned he wrote solely for money . During the spring of 1904 his face narrowed , his voice descended half an octave , his glance sharpened . His inner weather became less troubled . Perhaps he learned laughter from Demetria , Lauradel , and Izumi of whom we shall hear more ; perhaps it sprang from his pleasure in his work . His characteristic movements were swift ; he crossed and recrossed the city as though he had wings on his heels . At Christmas he sent his mother a sheaf of his " puddings " and gave for the first time an address to which she could reply . He made no apology for having withheld it so long  --  ostensibly to escape annoyance from the police  --  and she made no allusion to it : at any distance this mother and son could read each other 's thoughts . She expressed her pleasure in his articles . She thanked him for his remittances and assured him that they were no longer necessary . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sophia 's helpfulness . She told him that Lily had left Coaltown to study singing in Chicago . Lily sent her money regularly , but she did not know what name she had taken nor any address for her . ( The Ashleys were odd folk . ) She hoped that Roger would visit them in Coaltown before long . His room had been rented to many guests , but it would be readied for him . She made no mention of the ordeals they had undergone together two and a half years ago . She concluded her letter in German : she asked for a photograph of him . Both had written many drafts for these Christmas letters ; the emotion had been consigned to the wastepaper baskets.  |p233The  reporters spent a large part of their days and nights in Krauss 's , a German saloon on Wells Street , equidistant from their several newspapers ' offices . There they wrote their stories and carried on their week-long , month-long card games , and there they wrestled for the conversational crown . Roger needed their conversation , though he soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the vocabulary was rich . The talk turned largely on liquor ( after-effects of last night 's consumption ) , women ( rapacity of , their staggering over-self-estimation , Schopenhauer 's matchless essay on ) , politics ( gorgonzola in the City Hall , populace led by the nose ) , their editors ( exposure and downfall predicted ) , literature ( Omar Khayyam , greatest poet that ever lived ) , philosophy ( Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll , towering intellect of ) , Chicago 's rich men ( hands and feet in the trough ) , religion ( farcical character of , opiate of the masses ) , venereal disease ( wonder doctor reported in Gary , Indiana ) . Roger endured much browbeating . For a time they were able to ignore his rapid advancement . His youthfulness , ignorance , illiteracy , and countrified air rendered it incredible . It was assumed that some mysterious person , or persons , wrote the pieces for him . By June of 1904 , however , there could no longer be any doubt . Their condescension turned to violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded a retraction . He was no longer welcome at Krauss 's . Before that privilege was denied him , however , he had made a friend and taken a profit . The dean andNestor of the round tables , Thomas Garrison Speidel , " T.G. , " had adopted him as audience , pupil , and doormat . T.G. was a nihilist . For a time he had belonged to both anarchist and nihilist clubs and had addressed them  --  first to their admiration , then to their mounting bewilderment and fury . He was duly thrown out of both organizations . On the one hand he was eloquent on the necessity of razing all political and social institutions , but on the other he insinuated many a sneer at the enthusiasms of the revolutionary dream . His pre-eminence among the reporters reposed upon the purity with which he hated " every/thing " and upon the fact that he seldom spoke . He was a dean at forty-five and a mastiff among puppies . He had a fine head , lined and furrowed , and freckled with light blue stains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performers , who had found him , at the age of five , unadapted to acrobatic training . He had been farmed out to foster homes , flogged , scalded , locked up in cupboards , and always starved . There had been a history of running away , of stealing for hoboes ' dens , of reformatories , of being adopted by kindly and unkindly farmers , of more escapes . He had earned his living in many ways . He had followed county fairs and been a mesmerist in a side show . He had even dabbled in quack healing . In a camp meeting in Kentucky he had effected three cures so remarkable that a sacred rage descended on the congregations ; he barely escaped their enthusiasm with his life . He never ventured into healing again . Finally he came to rest as a reporter : the occupation was not sedentary ; it admitted of drinkingat all hours ; its demands on sustained thought were intermittent ; it flattered a delusion of omniscience . He had been married four or three times . Occasionally a child or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspaper office or at Krauss 's . They were well-behaved and bright  --  all T.G. 's wives had been , as his daughters proved to be , exceptional women . There is a limit to the number of ten-cent pieces a drinking man can dispense on a salary of twelve dollars a week . He talked to them with gravity and great charm . ( He reserved his contempt for personswhom he knew well . ) The children went away pleased ; they had merely wanted to look at their father . T.G. had a tormenting secret . He was the author of some verse dramas . Throughout that stormy childhood and youth he had read books . Unfortunately , he did not so much read books as read himself into books . He was incapable of a prolonged self-forgetfulness . He had never been able to finish Rousseau 's Confessions or even Anna Karenina  --  so great was the turbulence set up within him . Similarly , he was a victim of music . A bandp235concert unmanned him . Even as a boy he had eavesdropped under the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even slipped into churches . He made no distinction between good music and bad , but inferior music had a more rapid action . His dramas were called Abelard and Lancelot and , of course , Lucifer . He had never finished a play and never read a line to a human being . The friendship between T.G. and Roger resembled an armed truce . Each needed the other . T.G. needed a fresh ear for his doctrinesand a companion in total disillusion . He proselytized . Roger needed the older man 's conversation : it brought to the surface , it aerated , his half-formed misanthropy . In the early days of their association , T.G. 's picture of society as a facade concealing beast , sloth , peacock , blindworm , and asp glided into Roger 's mind like balm . If Roger had much to learn , he had much to unlearn . The two men were also useful to each other in a practical sense . They worked on different papers . After attending separately some trial , boxing match , or political meeting , one would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If T.G. had been drinking , Roger wrote two accounts of the event and gave one of them to his friend . It was neither the scabrous nor iconoclastic content of T.G. 's conversation that introduced a constant strain on their relationship ; it was the burden of insult and contempt that Roger was called upon to endure . " T.G. " could be rendered frantic by any reply that invoked moral values or a shade of idealism . " You dreck ! You donkey drool ! You yellow drawers ! You have no ideas ! All you 've got in your head are some clinkers from Coaltown and your grandmother 's old trusses ! " At this , Roger would rise , gaze at him a moment , kick over a chair , and start for the door . T.G. would call him back , tender a sour apology , and the truce would be resumed . It was not easy to humiliate or insult the Ashleys . Their attention would be riveted , not on themselves , but on their attempt to understand the sources of malice and enmity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hissed or booed in the opera houses of Europe ; she waited tranquilly through the tumult for the opinion of the majority to manifest itself and to make clear to herself , after the performance , the reasons for the antagonism . Many hotels and very many homes refused to receive Constance . She said , " After people have had the pleasure of being shocked they start to think . My best supporters began as my worst enemies . But why must that be ? " One of the reasons for Roger 's patience now was his search for an answer to that question : why does each of us do what we do  --  the petty , the favored , the aggressive , the meek ? Always there lurked the fear that one 's own view of truth was merely a small window in a small house . In the face of so important a concern any contempt poured on oneself was incidental .

Joe started coughing . ' Sorry , Joe , we ca n't use you any more ; you 're dying . ' And Dohenus : sixty-three men caught in a gas caloup . Fifty-one widows . Almost three hundred little orphans . ' Sorry ! One of those accidents , boys ! Sorry ! Act of God ! Better luck next time ! '  --  Did you notice how few people came forward to speak a good word for your father ? I went around Coaltown trying to get someone to express an opinion about the trial . ' What trial ? ' ' Where ? ' ' Who ? ' Where there 's injustice , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowardice . But the chain begins farther back : where there 's money , there 's injustice . " " There were no rich people in Coaltown , T.G. My father was n't a rich man . " " Shut your damned choppers ! He was on the leash from rich men . You come from the middle class , do n't you ? That is to say : the crawling class ? You do n't know how to use the words ' rich ' and ' poor . ' There were six in your family . You all had two pairs of shoes , did n't you ? " " Yes . " " You had meat every day of the week , did n't you ? You had meat twice a day . Blistering cabooses ! Anything you 'd have to say about poverty would be like a Chinese blindman describing Niagara Falls . Remember that ! There 's only one qualification for talking about poverty and that 's to have LIVED IT . " " My father got the company to build a clubhouse for the miners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have told you that . Listen to me : philanthropy is the roadblock in the path of social justice . Philanthropy is like an infected rain from heaven ; it poisoneth him who gives and him who takes . " " What do you mean , T.G. ? " " You went to the circus last week , did n't you ? Well , go again . Ask the guards to let you go into the lions ' cage at feeding time . Now , when the lion 's got that hunk of horsemeat between his teeth , you take it away from him . You can do it . Yes , you can . You can do it , but you have to KILL him first . That 's the picture of the rich man and his property . Get this straight . No rich man ever gave away a penny he could find a use for . Never has and never will . By separating themselves from a little money the rich feel justified in making a lot more . Spidersp238draw just enough silk out of their bowels to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their loved ones ; but the rich make silk and silk and silk . Nothing can stop them . Their houses are stuffed with it . Their banks are stuffed with it , and it 's not out of their bowels they make it , but out of the bowels and lungs and eyeballs of others . The little coins that fall from their tables make churches and libraries , do n't they ? Churches ! That 's where the soothing syrup 's stored . There 's no marriage tighter than that between the banker and the bishop . The poor should rest content in that situation in which God has seen fit to place them . It 's God 's will that they work a lifetime over a sewing machine or in a mine . Trent ! Get a-holt of this : theft is the obligation of the poor ! Over the city of Chicago hangs a poison-bloated cloud . Everybody can see it . It 's fed by the unequal distribution of wealth . It poisons the child in the cradle . It befouls the home . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth two feet away . The most sacred thing in the world is property . It 's more sacred than conscience . It 's more untouchablethan a woman 's reputation . And for all its importance , no one , NO ONE , has ever attempted to put a qualifying value on it . Propertycan be unearned , unmerited , extorted , abused , misspent , without losing one iota of its sacred character  --  its religious character . They used to hang a man for stealing a loaf of bread . We do n't do that now : we warp his life and maim his children . I was once given eight months for stealing a bicycle  --  a rich boy 's toy . But I was able to escape and steal another . I NEEDED a bicycle .  --  Listen to me : there 's going to be an earthquake .

T.G. was often able to read Roger 's thoughts , to drag into the light those that Roger did not dare pursue . " Hunkus , you 've been flabbergasted by the amount of people in Chicago , have n't you ? You 've been thinking that there are too many people in the world . You 've been thinking that most of ' em would be better off dead . Why , I 'm ashamed of you  --  a nice American boy like you going around killing people . Do n't lie to me ! Well , let me tell you something . Everybody does it . Are n't you glad every time you read about a train wreck , a flood , an earthquake ? Of course , you are . There 'll be more room for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of us . That 's why people read our newspapers . EXTRA ! EXTRA ! Excursion boat sinks with all on board . EXTRA ! Three cents . Read all about it ! ' And people read all about it . They 're filled with horror . It 's terrible . But , oh ! a little voice inside them says , ' It was getting a little crowded at the feeding trough . ' Their eyes glitter . ' I 'm glad it was n't me on that boat . ' More dead ! More dead ! They love it . And once they get these auto-MO-biles going , what a time we 'll have ! It 'll be great ! Especially on holidays . . . . Of course , war is best of all . During the Spanish War everybody in America read his newspaper at breakfast and hoped that every goddamned Spaniard in the world had been killed the day before . Every American ate Spaniards for breakfast . The great thing about war is that it makes murder legitimate . It permits Mr. Jones and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come out of the bushes and yell Kill ' em ! ' It 's called patriotism . People went to bed every night simply exhausted with the noble exertions of patriotism . In that courthouse in Coaltown , did n't you want to kill the whole caboodle ? " " Yes , I did . " " Thank you .  --  And they wanted to kill your father ? Why  --  for justice ? for revenge ? No ! They did n't care a broken horseshoe for the late Breckenridge Lansing . I found that out . They wanted , under coverp240of legality , to get your father out of the way . The capacity of human beings to wish their neighbors dead is unlimited . Now , mind you ! I do n't say that everybody wants everybody dead . We all belong to little clubs . We want the members of other clubs dead ; we only want the members of our own club STUNTED . A man wants his wife stunted and vice versa ; a father wants his son stunted and vice versa . " Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , you do n't know how lucky you are ! Listen to me : all fathers hate their sons . They hate them  --  first !  --  because they know that their sons will be going around whistling in the sunlight when they 're rotting under the ground . They know that their sons will be jangling the bedsprings with girls in their arms when the old man is wheezing in a wheelchair . That 's a bitter thought . Second ! They 're terrified that the boys may make less of a mess of their lives than they 've made . It 's a terrible thought that that man whom you knew as a little smeller in the cradle , as an idiotic puppy , as a troublemaking pimply adolescent  --  him !  --  that he could make a better showing in life than you 've done . Terrible ! And as no man has EVER been successful or happy inside inside , where his real judgment of himself sits  --  this becomes true of every father . No father since the beginning of time has ever given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son 's thinking big and planning big . No , sir-eee ! Dad sweats and wrings his hands and advises caution and going slow and keeping to the middle of the road . That passes under the name of paternal affection . Everybody knows that family life is a hell , but if you want to see a family life that 's really beautiful , go back to the zoo . Look at the lions and tigers and bears . They really love their young . They really do . To see the lion cubs playing under papa 's chin is the most beautiful sight in the world ; and mama pretending to be half asleep , keeping one eye on the cubs and one eye on the loathsome human beings on the other side of the bars . The only time when a human parent really loves its young is when the child is brought home on a shutter . Then some atavistic animal bond comes to life .

" Yes , there are too many people in the world . Nature 's only interested in one thing  --  to cover the earth with as thick a layer of protoplasm asp241possible : plants , fishes , insects , and animals . Did you ever see a field covered with anthills ? Billions of ants . Did you ever see a swarm of grasshoppers ? Nature 's not very bright . She does n't care if there 'll be food for all of us . She just keeps bringing us on the stage in vaster numbers . That 's why we die . When we can no longer make babies we 've got to go . ' Bring on another plate of murphies , Mrs. Casey .

Those are facts . For thousands of years men have been manufacturing interpretations : life 's a test of our character ; rewards and penalties after death ; God 's plan ; Allah 's Paradise , full of beautiful girls for everybody ; Buddha 's nirvana  --  we get that anyway , it means see nothing , feel nothing ' ; evolution , higher forms , social betterment , Utopia , flying machines , better shoelaces  --  nothing but THISTLE DUST ! Will you get that into your draughty head ? " Billions have believed that we are influenced variously by the sun , the moon , and the planets . Millions have scoffed at the notion . Millions have believed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own -- often erratically , brokenly , even grotesquely  --  but indubitably . The children of the Sun reflect the characteristics of Apollo leading the muses in his train , healing , cleansing with light , dispelling mists , prophesying : Thomas GarrisonSpeidel . The children of Saturn also shed their influence upon the growing man : Roger spent the greater part of the day moving about Chicago and its environs . He returned at intervals to his table in the tumultuous City Room , where he was accustomed to receive visits from persons wanting publicity for a favorite charity , an obituary for a relative ( Roger was very fine at obituaries ) , an advertisementp242for a lost pet . Some came to express approval or indignation . One morning as he was leaving his desk he was approached by a grave bearded man whom he recognized as the prominent lawyer AbrahamBittner . " Mr. Frazier ? " " Yes . Yes , Mr. Bittner . Please sit down . " Mr. Bittner sat down , slowly drew off his gloves , and looked at Roger in silence . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Bittner 's hands played with an agate fob that dangled from his watch chain . Roger 's eyes kept returning to some words engraved on two sides of the stone . Seeing his curiosity , Mr. Bittnerdrew out the watch and fob and placed them on the table . He remained silent as Roger looked more closely at the stone . " Are those words in Greek , Mr. Bittner ? " " They are in Hebrew . " Roger raised his eyes inquiringly . " Those words are the motto of a society to which I belong . I am calling on you today as a representative of that society . " " What do those words say , sir ? " " Have you a Bible in this office ? " " We had one . Someone took it . " " The words , in your Bible , are from the Book of the Prophet Isaiah , the third verse of the fortieth chapter : Make straight in the desert a highway for our God . ' " " May I pick it up , Mr. Bittner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and particularly its directingcommittee of twelve men . This committee  --  as a mark of esteem for what you are doing for the city of Chicago  --  would like to place a convenience at your disposal . " He paused . " You live in Room 441 at the Thurston House . The street under your windows is noisy until late at night and is particularly so in the early morning . The view from your two windows opens on the brick wall of Cowan 's warehouse . Are these things so ? " " Yes , Mr. Bittner. "  | " This committee wishes to rent to you for three years , at one dollar a year , an apartment on the fourth floor at 16 Bowen Street . Four of its windows look out upon the lake . There are absolutely no conditions attached to this offer . It is extended entirely in the interest of your well-being and continued productivity . The apartment is ready to receive you from this moment . Here are the keys . Here is a receipt for your signature . " Roger continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Mr. Bittner arrested him with raised hands . " You will not know the names of these committee members . They do not wish to be thanked . All but two are men of large means  --  very large means . They are Chicagoans . They love this city . They are resolved to do everything in their power to make Chicago the greatest , the most civilized , the most humane , the most beautiful city in the world . They have already extended parks , built fountains , and widened avenues . They contribute largely to the universities , the hospitals , the orphanages , to the rehabilitationof prisoners . You have written of your interest in the planting of trees . The committee has planted groves of oaks in the parks and has prevented others from being cut down . " He lowered his voice . A smile hovered about his lips  --  the smile of one sharinga secret with one who will understand its import . " They are thinking of some Jerusalem here in the future  --  a free Jerusalem . They are thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frazier , are doing a work which you alone can do . You have written with sympathy of the foreign communities in the city . You have restoreda measure of dignity to older men and women in the eyes of their own children . You have called the attention of your readers to deplorable things which it is in their power to alter  --  all this in your way . The committee has this fear : that you will leave Chicago , that you will carry on your valuable work in New York or in some other city . " He slowly put his watch and agate fob back into his pocket . The door of the editor 's office opened . Old Hickson appearedp244holding some yellow pages in his hand . He called angrily : " TRENT ! TRENT ! We ca n't print this goddamned slop . Who the hell 's interested in an old tramhorse ? Get on your toes ! Get a bee under your tail !

Thank the members of the committee . But I . . . I ... I 'm uncomfortable when I 'm given presents . I 'm sorry , Mr. Bittner , but that 's the way I am . " He laid the keys down soundlessly on Mr. Bittner 's side of the table . " Thank you , I 'm sorry . " Mr. Bittner rose . He smiled and put out his hand . " I shall call on you again in November . " Two nights later Roger walked to the address on Bowen Street . The windows on the fourth floor were dark . He compared the ground plan with that of the corresponding apartment on the first floor , where the windows were lighted and open . There would be a room for Sophia ; his mother could come and visit him . He looked long at the lake . But he was just nineteen . Those rooms were for a full-grown man . He did n't want to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November and was again refused . Ashleys do n't take presents . But it gave him a strange feeling , a hushed feeling : he was being watched by the good and the wise . Persons who did not give their names had unlocked his father 's handcuffs and given his father a horse . He tried to recall the words engraved on the stone . . . about a road . . . about deserts . The Archbishop of Chicago had written Mr. Frazier a letter of appreciation on " Trent 's " account of the inauguration of St. Casimir 's Home . He had sent a copy of " A Cap for Florence Nightingale " to his sister , who directed a hospital in Thuringia . Whenp245Roger printed a " pudding " about the midnight procession around a church on the eve of its patron 's day ( " A Thousand Candles , A Thousand Singers " ) he wrote again , inviting the author to lunch . Roger knew better than to accept invitations from the important and the well-to-do ( as he put it to himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the Archbishop had said there would be no other guests . Roger accepted it . The door was opened by a young priest who stared at him in astonishment . The two had met frequently in the hospital . " Hello ! " " Hello , Father Betz . " They shook hands . " Euh ... Have you come from the hospital about something ? " " No . Archbishop Kruger 's asked me to lunch . " " Oh ! Come in .... Are you sure it 's today ? He 's expecting a man who works on a newspaper . " " That 's me . " " A Mr. Frazier . " " Yes . " Roger was accustomed to this . The Archbishop had been told that " Trent " was young . He expected to meet a man of forty . Roger expected to meet an imposing prelate . Both were astonished . The Archbishop was very old and bent ; he spoke with what Roger described to himself as a " cricket 's voice , " for he had had an operation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward theold , the Archbishop 's particularly toward the young . The latter was delighted , amused , and moved ; Roger was delighted and moved . " You and Father Betz have met before ? Did I hear you exchange greetings at the door , Mr. Frazier ? " " Yes , Father . I met him often in the South Side Hospital . I worked as an orderly there . " " Ah , did you ? " The Archbishop 's conversation was inter/spersed  --  when he was pleased with a continuous murmur offaint interjections : " Well , well , " and " Truly ? " and " You do n't say ! " Muttering gently , his face almost below the level of his shoulders , he led his guest into the dining room . He spoke some words in Latin , crossed himself , and pointed with both hands to Roger 's chair . " It is very kind of you . . . hm , yes . . . from your busy day to give me this opportunity to express my pleasure . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most sympathetic , most understanding accounts of . . . the dear sisters at St. Elizabeth 's were delighted ... were delighted . . . oh , yes , oh , yes . . . at your story about the capping exercises of young nurses . You see things . . . you see things in a way that others do not see them . You not only instruct us , you enlarge us . Yes , I can say that . " Roger laughed . He seldom laughed and only then where there was nothing to laugh about . He laughed now because of a certain sparkling gaiety that appeared and disappeared on his host 's face . The thought occurred to him that it must be a great pleasure to have a thing he had never known : a grandfather . It was a Friday in early Lent . They were served a little cup of soup made from greens , a trout , some potatoes , a glass of wine , and a bread pudding . Another unusual thing took place in Roger . In reply to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked . He was asked about his early years . " My real name is Roger Ashley . I was born in Coaltown in the southern part of the state . " He waited . The Archbishop drew in his breath . He gazed into Roger 's eyes in silence . " Did you ever hear the story of my father 's trial and escape , Father ? " " I did . . . . Would you wish to refresh my memory about it ? " Roger talked for ten minutes . The Archbishop interruptedhim only once . He rang a small handbell . " Mrs. Kegan , be sop247kind as to give Mr. Frazier that other trout . . . . You young men have a good appetite . I remember that . And do kindly finish those creamed potatoes . " " Thank you , ma'am , " said Roger . " Kindly continue , Mr. Frazier . " When Roger had finished his story , his host looked for a moment at a picture on the wall behind his guest 's back . The murmured interjections had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very unusual events , Mr. Frazier.  - -  And you do not know who your father 's rescuers were ? " " No , Father . " " You have no idea who they were ? " " No , Father . " " What is your dear mother doing now ? " " She 's running a boardinghouse in Coaltown . " Silence . " You have received no news of your father ... of any kind ... in . . . almost two years ? " " No , Father . " Silence . " Both your father and mother are Protestants ? " " Yes . Father took us every Sunday to the Methodist church . We went to Sunday school , too . " " Were there ... ? Forgive me , did you have prayers in the home ? " " No , Father . My father and mother never talked about things like that . " " You plan to be a writer ? You will be a writer all your life ? " " No , Father . I only write these things to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , Mr. Frazier ? " " I do n't see that very clearly yet . " Slowly Roger raised his eyes to those of the old man . In a low voice he said , " Father , I think you have something to say about those things that happened in Coaltown. "  | " Do I ? ... Do I ? . . . Mr. Frazier , those events are unusual . Your way of telling them is unusual . Your father 's behavior was unusual . Let me say that to my eyes there are some unusual aspects that perhaps you do not see . " Roger waited . " I think I may be able to make clear what I mean by telling you a story . A story . A number of years ago in one of the southern provinces of China there was a wave of hatred against all foreigners . A considerable number were killed . All the members of one of our missions were taken prisoner  --  a bishop , four priests , six sisters , and two Chinese servants . All but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small cell in a long low building made of clay and pebbles . They were allowed no communication with one another . From time to time one or another of them would be led out to be tortured . They expected that at any moment they would be beheaded . However , their execution was delayed and after a few years they were released . Can you hear me ? " " Yes , Father . " " The Bishop was placed in the central cell of thirteen . What do you think he did , Mr. Frazier ? " Roger thought a moment . " He ... he started tapping on the walls . He counted the letters of the alphabet . " The Archbishop was delighted . He rose and went to the wall . He rapidly tapped a group of five , then another group of five , then twice . Again Roger thought a moment . " L , " he said . " In German we think of I and J as one letter . " " M , " said Roger . The Archbishop returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very late at night and the tapping could only be heard through one wall . So , in the depth of the night messages of love and courage and faith were passed back and forth . Now the jailers had placed the two Chinese servants in the two end cells . They had been blinded by the guards so that theyp249would not attempt to escape from those outer cells . They were Christians and they knew German , but they did not know how to read or write . The Chinese languages can not be reduced to any pattern of tapping . How did the Bishop communicate with them ? " " I do n't see how he could , Father . " The Chinese are very musical . He directed their neighbors to tap out the rhythms of the hymns they knew and the rhythms of the spoken prayers  --  of what you call the Lord 's Prayer . ' They tapped back in joyous response . They had been rescued from their abandonment . Now in time several of these prisoners died . The cells were empty and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the Chinese put some other prisoners into those cells  --  an English silk merchant and an American businessman and his wife . They knew no German . The Bishop knew some French and some English . He sent messages from cell to cell in those languages and finally received a reply in English . He asked these prisoners kindly to transmit some messages in German to thecells beyond their own , explaining that they were words of religious comfort . Time was allotted to the newcomers . The Americans madeit clear that they had no wish to partake of any religious messages , but across eight cells the husband comforted the wife and the wife the husband . How many were now transmitting patterns that were unintelligible to them ? " " All but the Bishop . " " During the early months  --  because of starvation , loss of consciousness , and other things  --  the German prisoners had lost count of the calendar . It was from the English merchant that they learned the day and the week and the month . They got back their Sundays and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that strengthens our steps and confirms our joy . In time another cell became vacant . It was filled by a Portuguese , a shopkeeper from Macao . He knew only Portuguese , Spanish , and Cantonese . Apparently he was an intelligent and well-disposed man . Throughoutthe night he tapped out messages from the right wall to thep250left wall and from the left wall to the right wall . Perhaps he thought his fellow prisoners were planning some escape  --  some attempt to murder a guard and to set the watchhouse on fire . Do you think so ? " Roger thought . " I think that , if he 'd believed that , he would have got tired of it after a few weeks . " " Why did I tell you this story , Mr. Frazier ? " " You were telling me that my father and mother were like the Portuguese man . " " We all are . You are , Mr. Frazier . I hope I am . Life is surrounded by mysteries beyond the comprehension of our limited minds . Your dear parents have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmit ( we hope ) fairer things than we can fully grasp . " Silence . " Is this story true , Father ? " " Oh , yes . I have talked with one of the sisters . " " What was she like , Father ? " " What was she like ? ... Well . . . The greatest joys are those that come to us upon some confirmation of our faith  --  even in small fragments of faith , faith in St. Casimir 's Home , in a friendship , in the survival of a family . Sister Benedikta was joyous . " To himself Roger said , " I hope Papa is joyous . " At the door , taking his leave , Roger asked and received permission to print the story for his readers . It appeared four weeks later as " A Tapping on Your Wall . " At the close of it there was a pattern of vertical strokes , looking somewhat like a broken picket fence . Thousands of Chicagoans worked at it . They found : " API ESTR T E AL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It crossed the seas . The layers of ice about Roger 's heart were beginning to melt or  --  shall we say ?  --  the plates of armor to fall to the ground . His freedom from isolation was accelerated by his encounters with a number of young women.  |p251The  Ashley children were widely regarded as " precocious . " Three of them had gained a certain notoriety by twenty-four . The truth is they were slow to mature in mind and body ; they met the appointments of growth , however , soundly though late . Roger 's work required his crossing and recrossing Chicago daily  --  " like a skeeter bug on a pond , " said T.G. At banquets , entertainments , athletic events he was coming to recognize and know a large number of young women . He particularly singled out those of other nations , colors , and backgrounds . These were all slightly older than himself , self-supporting , and employers of others . There were not many of this latter category at the beginning of the century . They were pioneers and were viewed askance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They did most of the talking , but so intent a listener was he that they received the impression of having heard a great deal from him . They were not like other young women ; he was not like other young men . It was only several years later that Roger became aware of all that he had learned from Demetria , Ruby , and the rest . Only later , too , did he realize that these associationshad released him from a dangerous constraint . Mysterious are the processes of sexual selection . All the young women were vivacious , enterprising , and above all independent ; only one was tall , only one was light-haired . He was expunging from his imagination  --  byurgent necessity  --  the compelling presence of the woman whom he had loved so passionately and whose failure to respond to him had come close to convincing him that he would never be loved , that he could never love . None of these women resembled his mother . Demetria was Greek but with Turkish and Lebanese blood , twenty-six , big hipped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger , she was making her way in Chicago fast . She had begun the climb at fourteen , sewing flowers on hats for twelve hours a day in a sweatshop  --  foreman at sixteen , a purchaser of materials and a scout for market outlets at twenty . At twenty-one she had opened a sweatshop of her own . There was an expandingp252market for ugly house dresses . Every Sunday she visited her baby on a farm near Joliet . Roger first met her at the farm . ( Hence Trent 's article " Kennels for Babies . " ) Madame Anne-Marie Blanc , from the Province of Quebec , rose and gold , short and plump , avowedly twenty-nine , was a caterer for weddings and wakes , for patriotic societies and conventions . At the conclusion of a dinner , Roger  --  that experienced restaurant man  --  would go into the kitchen and help pack up , filling the great hampers with crockery and silver . He watched Madame Blanc pay her army of cooks and waiters . He knew a genius for organization when he saw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay and have a cup of coffee ; she could take off her shoes and rest . She suffered from insomnia and dreaded returning to her rooms . He ventured to tell her that the food she served was less than appetizing . She burst out laughing . " Yes , yes  --  but they like it . All I want , Mr. Frazier , is money . If you will stop and think for five minutes  --  only five minutes , Mr. Frazier  --  about the life of a woman , you will understand that the first thing she wants is money . Girl , wife , or widow . Of course , I mean a sensible woman . " She knew that Roger was the " writer man Trent " ; she collected his pieces . She suffered from insomnia and from a despairing need to tell her story , but no one in this world listens . At first slowly , then with alarming rapidity , Roger came to learn that there were two Anne-Maries  --  the trenchant able businesswoman , rose and gold , given to quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death and hell , haunted by memories of her childhood , athirst for a humane word , a humane ear , a humane touch . He discovered that she fortified herself in the evening with creme de menthe which she drank by the half pint . Before long she hurled herself at him in a storm of fear , dependence , and gratitude . Roger did not know enough to be afraid ; besides , we came into this world to learn and to be useful . Lauradel , Negro , was twenty-seven , a singer and part owner of the " Old Dixie Ballroom , a Refined Dance Floor for Ladies and Gentlemen . " From time to time Roger visited the establishment towardp253two in the morning to hear Lauradel sing " Jaybird , do n't you sing that song at me " and " I walk on the water and I 'm not afraid . " Ruby Morris was Japanese and Hawaiian , twenty-six . She had been adopted by some missionaries on the Islands and brought to this country , where she so profited by the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers , and all those tender sentimental benefactors , who  --  treating her always as a pretty doll  --  had hovered over her progress . She renounced Christianity , relearned Japanese , turned Buddhist , and struck out for herself . With help from the small Japanese community in Chicago , she opened a store for curios , kimonos , and gifts . She prospered . He entered into each relationship with an intensity that approachedviolence . He pursued several simultaneously to the verge of endangering even the redoubtable store of health that had been allotted to the Ashley 's . This phase of dissipation , however , came to an end almost as abruptly as it began , and without rancor . All was conducted under the sign of independence . He had made no promises and exerted no claims . Demetria and Ruby wanted to do his laundry for him ; Anne-Marie and Lauradel wanted to buy him shirts and shoes ; Ruby and Anne-Marie offered him a room in which to live ; but he avoided any shadow of dependency . These young women divined that something was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beyond vanity . They knew also that he was honest and that in some obscure way he was " in trouble . " Without knowing it he called upon their understanding ; without knowing it he afforded them an opportunity to serve . And he , in turn , brought them an exceptional gift  --  his ardor held a large measure of wonder and curiosity and discovery . They were accustomed to being desired ; it was something new to be listened to . Lauradel : " I used to see you come in and sit in that dark corner . You were n't hiding from me , Junior . I knew you were listening . Andp254you 'd come up afterwards and say something gentlemanly and put twenty cents in the saucer . I do n't forget anything . And then you put that piece in the paper about our ' Ballroom ' and about my singing and the white people started coming to the place and we had to move in eight more tables .  --  Have you gone off to sleep again , big ears ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Go to sleep , if you want ... Men ! ... But that thing you put in the paper about me being such a good singer that I did n't have to sing bad taste  --  I was mad ! I was n't sure I knew what that meant . I asked people  --  some said it meant vulgar and commonand dirty ! Oh , I was mad . You and your cat's-mess taste . The next night you came in , I wanted to go over to your table and tell you to GO HOME and take your taste with you . We did n't want you and your pweetsy-tweetsy taste here . You ! . . . You ! ... " " Stop hitting me , Lauradel ! " " Because there are only two things I like to sing about : my religion and making love . And I do n't have to ask permission out of you , Mr. Tasty . I 'm sorry I hit you , newspaperboy . I did n't break any of your bones . Are n't you ashamed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , you people that live in the middle of the United States and do n't know anything about the ocean ! Do you know where I came from ? " " Yes . " " Well , I 'll tell you . I came from the islands off the State of Georgia where only the boiled shrimps are that color of you . The sun gets hot in Chicago , too , but it is n't real sun , not real . It has n't got any salt in it . You 're a poor little fresh-water nothing . " " I ca n't breathe , Lauradel .... " " Taste !  --  Think about this for a minute . If nobody made love for a hundred days ! Are you thinking about that  --  just to please your big Lauradel ? People would be creeping around the streets as though their spines had turned to jello . Even the childrenwould stop jumping rope . You 'd go in a store and ask for ap255pair of shoes and the man would say , Ma'am , shoes ? Oh yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' Just imagine what people 's eyes would be like  --  like holes you burned in wallpaper . The birds would fall out of trees ; their wings would n't have any zupp in them . The trees would sag like old widows with female trouble . And God would get up . He 'd look down . He 'd say , WHAT'SGOING ON AROUND HERE ? THIS HAS GOT TO STOP ! I DO N'T WANT ANY MORE OF MR . TRENT 'S CAT'S-MESS TASTE AROUND HERE . " Roger slid out of bed and , kneeling , put his arms around her . She pushed him away , roaring with laughter , royal . " GET LOVING , YOU SONS-OF-BITCHES , OR THE WORLD WILLTURN COLD . That 's what I sing about ! Now do you under-stand ? " " Lauradel , you 're as big as a house ! " " Well , do n't you start getting me mixed up in my head about what 's vulgar and what 's not vulgar , because you do n't know andI know . " Still laughing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Get away from me , you little paperboy ! I do n't know why I go around with such a pink wart . " " You can hit me all you want to , Lauradel . " " Get back into bed and stop playing the fool on my carpet . You 'll get splinters in your foot .  --  I told you about all the bad times I 've been through , did n't I ? " " Yes , you did . " " When a person 's been through ALL THAT and comes out alive  --  that person knows what 's what . " " Tell me some more about your grandfather Demus . " " Well , first : I 've got another old bone to pick with you . " " What else have I done wrong , Lauradel ? " " Mr. Trent  --  I mean Mr. Frazier  --  you hurt my feelings so bad that I do n't think I 'll ever get over it . And you know how you did it ! " Roger was silent . " You sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honorable or decent . "  | " Lauradel ! " " You keep saying ' Lauradel , ' but you do n't love me . " " Lauradel , that 's the way I am . " " When people love each other money does n't matter . Love kills money . I love to give , Mr. Trent . I wish I had a million dollars . I 'd give you a . . . shoelace . You sent back the coat I gave you . You dress bad . You do n't dress any better than an old crow . " " Do n't cry , Lauradel . Do n't cry . " " You gave me a present : a real genuine invitation to Abraham Lincoln 's funeral . " " I did n't buy that . A lady gave it to me . An old lady gave it to me because of a piece I wrote in the paper . " " But you gave it to me  --  in your heart you gave it to me . " " Do n't cry , Lauradel . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well ... " " Lauradel , I have to get some sleep . I have to be at City Hall early tomorrow . Sing me to sleep , will you ? " " What 'll I sing you , boy ? Shall I sing you ' Sometimes I feel like a motherless child ' ? " " No , not that one . " " I 'll sing you one I never sang you before . It 's in the languagemy people talked on Sea Island , Georgia . It 's about why God made shells . " And Ruby : " What are you whispering to yourself about , Ruby ? " " Go to sleep , Trent . I 'm reciting the Lotus Scripture . " " I do n't want to go to sleep . I want to hold your hand andhear you talk . " " Sh ... sh ... ! " " What is that new sign they 're putting over the door downstairs , Ruby ? " " I 'm changing my name and the name of the store . I 've wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait until the business was going well . Tomorrow 's an important day for me , Trent.  |p257Please  , will you , please , never call me Ruby again . My name isIZUMI . " He kissed the tips of her fingers and said , " Izumi , Izumi . " Weightlessly , trailing her soft robe , she left the bed and knelt on the floor . She lowered her forehead , as though acknowledginga courtesy . " You are the first person to call me by my name . " " What does the name mean , Izumi ? " " Trent , have you heard that some people believe that men and women are reborn many times ? " " As many times as there are sands in the Ganges River . " " Trent ! " " And that , we either go up a great staircase to the threshold of happiness or that we sink down and drag others down with us . " " Trent ! " " We become almost-Buddhas . I forget what we are called then . " She put two fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet . Because her poetry was beautiful and because she loved the Lotus Scripture she became a Bodhisattva . " " Do you believe that , Izumi  --  that people are born again and again ? " Again she placed her finger on his mouth . " We call the world the Burning House . " " What ? " " We are born again and again in the hope that someday , someday , we shall escape from this burning house . " " You are very high up on the ladder , Izumi . " She drew herself up straight as though she were offended . Then she laid her head down upon the pillow and turned away . " How can you tell whether a person is high up or low down ? Is it when a person is good ? " " Do not use the word ' good . ' Say ' free . ' I am very low down on the ladder , Trent . " " You ? "  | " Yes , I have a great many weights that hold me down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She placed the knuckles of her left hand between her breasts . " Here ! I have a great ulcer , here . " " Ruby ! Ruby ! Izumi ! " " Weights . Weights . Of anger . Of spite . I can not forgive the people who tried to be kind to me . They hung their weights on me . Why should I be angry at them ? They were ignorant . They were Christians ! Oh , their burning house ! To please them I was a detestable , unnatural , false little girl . They robbed me of my childhood and girlhood . See how angry I am ! Go to sleep , Trent . I must say the Lotus Scripture . " " Name one more weight , Izumi . " Again she turned her head away on the pillow . She whispered , " You . " " No ! " He seized her hand . " Say no . " She raised herself on her elbow and said , " You are very high on that stairway , Trent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're saying ! " " You are not attached to things . You do not want fame or riches . You do not want to crush people with your power . You do not envy others . You are not proud . You have no hates . You are freeing yourself from everything that is bad in your Karma . When I first knew you I thought that maybe you were a Bodhisattva . But when I knew you a little better I could see that there was a little violence in you , left over , a little violence in your Karma . " " What is Karma , Izumi ? " " It is the burden of fate that we have created for ourselves during all our thousands of past lives . " He went around to her side of the bed and knelt before her face . " I am a weight in your life . I am not helping you to climb the great ladder . " " Trent , do not be impatient . Impatience never freed a man from the burning house . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind to me . Will you go to sleep now ? " " Yes . " She returned to whispering her sacred text . " Translate to me the words that you were saying just then , Izumi . " " I had come to the place where it tells of the plants that are reborn . " " Plants go to Heaven , too ? ? ! " " Trent ! Trent ! Every living thing is a part of the nature of the One . You know that . That 's why you write about animals so well . And about the planting of oak trees . We are all in the One . " The turbulence of these associations subsided . When he came to have more money in his pocket he invited one or the other out to dinner . How they talked to him and his large ears ! He laughed oftener  --  with them and at them and at himself . Roger 's interest in the opera had abated . Reading  --  his new discovery  --  was now feeding his hunger for the noble and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , when his favorites were performed . There was a late spring season in 1905 . At the close of a performance Roger stood near the main entrance watching the audience disperse . His attention was attracted by a very beautiful young woman who was also lingering by a marble column . He had noticed her on a number of occasions , always seated in a box with a handsome couple of older years ; he assumed she was their daughter . On this evening the mother was absent . The father had been detained in conversation by friends . The young woman had just replaced an enormous hat on her head . She was elegant , tightly laced , conspicuous , accustomed to the world 's gaze and unabashed by her temporary isolation . She had acquired the art of looking through the admiring faces that turned toward her . With one gloved hand she meditatively smoothed the veil drawnp260over her chin , with the other she played with a feather boa thrown over her shoulders . This was not the kind of woman that Roger found attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was her air of being upborne on some tide of supreme assurance . Suddenly he realized that this was his sister Lily . Her companion rejoined her and they left the theatre , Roger following . Apparently they had only a short distance to go . They talked in Italian . He heard his sister 's laughter  --  of a kind he had not heard from her before ; it ranged over an octave and a half ; it echoed in the streets . They came to a grey sandstone house that bore a brass plate : " The Josepha Carrington Jones Club for Young Ladies . " Lily , latch key in hand , turned and thanked her escort warmly . He continued down the street , humming . As she was unlockingthe door Roger spoke her name softly . " I beg your pardon ? " " Lily , I 'm Roger . " She flew down the steps on the wings of her great cloak and threw her arms around him . " Roger , Roger ! Darling Roger !  --  Oh ! How tall you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to show you to Maestro Lauri , my singing teacher . He just left me here at the door . " How long had he been in Chicago ? What did he do ? Oh , how he looked like Papa  --  dear wonderful Papa ! " Can we go somewhere for a cup of coffee ? No man is allowed in this building after six . Wait for me here until I change my clothes . . . . I have to kiss you again .. Roger , what does it all mean  --  what happened to us ? " She started up the stairs then turned back . " Roger , I have a little boy  --  he 's wonderful , wonderful . Roger , how did Mama feel about my running away ? I had to do it , Roger . I had to get away from Coaltown . I 'm never going back  --  never , never . I send Mama money every month . " " I know you do . " " Soon I 'll be able to send her lots . " Twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lily resembled her mother and Constance ; Roger resembled his father and Sophia . For a time what they saw was more engrossingthan what they said . The cascades of laughter . " I have the most beautiful baby in the world and I 'm not even married . " Laughter . She raised her hand and showed him the gold band . " I bought it in a pawnshop ! I 'm Mrs. Helena Temple . The boy 's name is John Temple . He 's living with an Italian family that loves him to death . I do n't know when he 'll learn to speak English . " It was not new to Roger that those who ask no questions receive the fullest answers . " I passed his father on the street yesterday . He hates me . " Laughter . " He hates me because he struck me . " " What ? " " Twice , in fact . He struck me because I laughed at him . Men hate to be laughed at . He kept trying to teach me such stupid music . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He wanted me to practice kicking a top hat off his head . Imagine ! " ( Laughter . ) " But  --  in his way  --  he 's a perfectly nice man ! I 'll always be grateful to him for taking me to Maestro Lauri . I sang two of those songs I used to sing in Coaltown and the Maestro said that I was the pupil he 'd spent his life hunting for . Every month I write him a receipt for the lessons I 've had and when I earn enough I 'll start paying him back . I sing at funerals and weddings and I sing in the Episcopal church on Sunday mornings , and in a Presbyterianchurch in the evenings . The funeral parlors send for me five and six times a week  --  Schubert 's ' Ave Maria . ' Fifteen dollars  --  take it or leave it ! I wo n't sing ' I know a garden where roses sleep . ' I 'm a tartar , Roger ! Weddings  --  Handel 's ' Where'er you walk '  --  fifteen dollars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Lots of peopleare furious at me , but I get jobs .  --  Roger , what do you do ? " " I 'll tell you later . How did it come to an end with the father of your boy ? " " Well , he struck me a second time . There we were in thatp262hot hotel room and he 'd been trying to teach me a song and dance called ' The Way We Do the Cancan in Kentucky . ' Imagine ! I said I would n't do it one more moment and I laughed at him . He struck me hard . And he cried . He really loved me in a way . When he left the room I stole his amethyst ring and went to that club for working girls . For a while I washed dishes and helped cook . I showed them I knew everything about boardinghouses ! They wanted to make me housekeeper . Then I had my wonderful baby in a Catholic hospital . I loved everything about it . I sang to the other girls . I sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sisters were laughing . Giovannino was born to laughter and my screeches and Mozart 's ' Alleluia . ' He was a seven-months baby , but he 's as strong as I am . I 'm going to have a hundred boys and girls  --  all beautiful and strong like Gianni . " Roger could not take his eyes from his sister 's face . Hismother , who had so beautiful a smile , seldom  --  never  --  laughed . " But that 's enough about me ! Tell me , what work do you do ? " " I write for newspapers . " " Oh , do that ! Do that ! Someday you 'll be as good as ' Trent . ' Do you ever read ' Trent 's ' pieces ? " " Yes . " " I save them . I sent some to Mama . The Maestro thinks they 're very good and Signora Lauri has collected every one of them . " " Lily , I 'm Trent . " " You 're ' Trent ' ! You 're ' Trent ' ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Maestro had invited a group of friends to a musicale in his studio on the following night . He was introducing three of his pupils , including Lily . Roger had always known that the dreamy absent-spirited Lily could sing beautifully . What astonished him now was the noble utterance . The breadth . She set the windowpanesrattling with passionate declarations of joy and grief . He thought : " How proud Mama will be ! " Roger became a favorite in the Maestro 's home . Signorap263Lauri enrolled him among her sons  --  the three living and the two dead . His chair was beside hers at the mighty nine-course Milanese dinners  --  the family 's and the guests ' anniversaries , the birthdays of Garibaldi and Verdi and Manzoni . The Maestro was in his late sixties . Long ago he had been marooned in New York through the bankruptcy of an opera troupe which he had served as assistant conductor , chorus master , and occasional baritone . From there he was invited to Chicago to teach singing in a conservatory that had also failed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire family returned to Milan to visit their relatives . He was tall , thin , and as erect as a drill master . He dressed with the greatest care . He wore a tou pet ; his superb mustaches were dyed and perfumed . His expression was that of a lion tamer whose beasts were constantly in revolt ; lightning flickeredin his eyes . Signora Lauri 's life was not an easy one . She bore the brunt of his resentment against all that went wrong in existence . She was his unsatisfactory pupils , his dyspepsia ; she brought the three-day snow and drove the thermometer to one hundred and four . Yet he was boundlessly dependent on her . If she were to die , he would dwindle to a peppery , posturing old man  --  old and emptied . Occasionally his impotent rage against circumstance burst forth . He heaped sarcasms upon her ; he denounced her for having ruined his life , she and her wagonload of disrespectful children . She held her chin high ; the glance from her eyes would wither a grapevine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear-drenched and very grand . Signora Lauri understood it all . That was marriage . She had the ring and a home and she had borne him ten children . Her greatest trials were his infidelitiesand her enormous size . She once showed her son Roger the photograph of a painting by a modern master . The original hung in a gallery in Rome , she said . It showed a lovely girl of sixteen , standing by a parapet over Lake Como . Roger looked up at her inquiringly ; she reddened and nodded slightly . " La vita , la vita . " The maestro spoke a number of languages with a singing teacher 's precision and with the relish of one for whom languagesp264are themselves artistic creations . It became his custom to lead Roger into his studio after dinner . He was in the mood for conversation . Lily and his daughters begged to join them , but were sternly told that the time had come for " men 's talk . " Roger had found another Saturn . What is art ? Roger had a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The homes of the rich ( weddings and suicides ) and the choicer brothels ( mayhem ) that he had penetrated as a reporter abounded in art  --  bronze girls holding up lamps , paintings of ladies getting ready to take a bath . There were a lot of cows in art and monks holding wine glasses up to the light . Catholic churches were full of art . Most art , though , was about pretty girls . " Mr. Frazier , works of art are the only satisfactory products of civilization . History , in itself , has nothing to show . History is the record of man 's repeated failures to extricate himself from his incorrigible nature . Those who see progress in it are as deluded as those who see a gradual degeneration . A few steps forward , a few steps back . Human nature is like the ocean , unchanging , unchangeable . Today 's calm , tomorrow 's tempest  --  but it 's the same ocean . Man is as he is , as he was , as he always will be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you a story : " My family has lived for centuries in Monza , a town near Milan . One day my mother decided to take us children into the city to see the paintings in the great Brera Gallery . Wherever my mother went she was accompanied by an old family servant whom we children called Aunt Nanina . Zia Nanina had never been in a picture gallery and would never have thought of entering one . Such places were for rich people , people who could read and write , who talked all the time about l'arte . But lo ! Great heavens , suddenly , at the Brera , amid all those Madonnas and Holy Families , Zia Nanina was completely at home . She was as busy as she could be , crossing herself and bobbing up and down and saying herp265prayers . Did Zia Nanina think those paintings were beautiful ? Oh , yes  --  but we Italians use the word bello four hundred times a day . For her those pictures were filled with something far more important than beauty . They were filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " There on the wall was the Virgin . One day our family  --  her family  --  was crossing Lake Como in a small boat . A terrible storm arose . We would surely drown . Who prayed like the dynamo of a great ocean liner ? Zia Nanina . And the Holy Mother parted the clouds and pulled our boat safely to shore with Her own sacred hands . What power ! There on the wall was a Saint Joseph . One day when I was seven a fishbone stuck in my throat . I was strangling . I turned purple . But Saint Joseph pulled that fishbone out . Zia Nanina was aware of the power of those exalted persons every day of her life  --  as were my mother and uncle , as are my wife and daughters to this day . " I do n't believe in God . I believe that those celebrated men and women  --  Mary of Nazareth and her family  --  are now each a pinch of dust , like all the billions of men and women who have died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievement . " You have been in this room before . Look about you . What do you see ? " " Your collection , Maestro . Statues and paintings ... " " I do n't believe in God , but I love the gods . Each of these figures and paintings was made to represent that power , more than that : to transmit that power . Every work in this room has been at one time an object of fear or love or of urgent appeal  --  in most cases of all three emotions at once . Nothing here was intended for mere ornament or decoration . This is from Mexico . . . . These are the Great Twins . They have lain in the salt water about three thousand years , shipwrecked . Sailors made their last prayers to them . . . . This is an African mask worn in dances for victory or rain . . . . Here is an engraved gem . Take it over to the light . Itp266shows Mercury  --  Hermes Psychopompos  --  leading the soul of a dead woman to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . " " Power ? " Roger looked at it for a time and said , " Yes . " " And this . . . a Khmer head from Angkor Wat  --  the half-closed eyes , the smile that never tires . " " That 's Buddha , " said Roger abruptly . " Who can count the prayers that have ascended to gods who do not exist ? Mankind has himself created sources of help where there is no help and sources of consolation where there is no consolation . Yet such works as these are the only satisfying products of culture . " Save sacred art And sacred song , Nothing endures For long . " There was a knock at the door . The Maestro was called to the telephone . Roger turned his back on the objects and went to the window  --  the lights of the city . He said to himself , " He 's missed something . He 's forgotten something . I 'll find it . I must find it . " On Sundays Roger called for his sister at the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Alt-Heidelbergrestaurant and spent the rest of the afternoon in the country with little Giovannino , who , by July at nine months , was on the threshold of walking and of talking Italian . He lived in a householdof adoring women and took to his uncle with clamorous delight . He seemed to have the idea that only a man could teach a man to walk . He crawled ten miles a day and was becoming thoroughlyimpatient with it.  |p267Sunday  dinners at the Alt-Heidelberg ( June , 1905 ) : " My clothes ? I 'm a pirate . There 's a girl at the club who sells them at Towne and Carruther 's . I go into her department and try on a lot of dresses . She pretends she does n't know me and says , Yes , madam ' or ' No , madam . ' And I steal the ideas and we make them at home . The materials are awfully expensive , but we know where to get mill ends . We have lots of fun . We help all the girls in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl alone has to be awfully bright just to live . " ( Roger wrote a " pudding " called " Take a Letter , Miss Spencer . " ) " Roger , sometimes I think I 'll go crazy because I do n't know anything . I want to learn every language in the world . I want to know how women thought a thousand years ago  --  and what electricityis and how the telephone works  --  and about money and banks . I do n't understand why Papa never thought about better schools for us . All sorts of people ask me to tea and dinner , but I tell them I have a sore throat . I stay home and read . Even when we 're making dresses one of the girls reads aloud to us . Last night there were eight of us working until midnight . We were all crowded together in my tiny room and we took turns reading an English lady 's Letters from Turkey . What do you read ? " Another Sunday ( July ) : " Oh , yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Most of the heroines in opera are such geese . I 'm really a concert singer and an oratorio singer . But I 'll sing opera to make money . " " You could make enough money singing what you want to . Why should you make more ? " Lily looked up at him in surprise . " Why , for my children . " " Your husband would support your children , would n't he ? " " Roger ! Roger ! Do n't talk to me about husbands ! I 'm goingto have a dozen children and I 'm going to love every one of theirfathers , but I 'm never going to be married to anyone . Marriage isa worn-out old custom like owning slaves or adoring royal families.  |p268I  believe that there wo n't be any marriages in a hundred years . Besides , I pity the man who 'd be married to me . I love my singing and my babies and my learning things and my plans . . . . I now have a Polish towhead . I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And a Spanish boy . . . and adopt so many ! " " Is that what you mean by your plans ? " She paused and looked at him gravely . She carried with her a great square velvet handbag to hold her music . She leaned over and drew from it a sheaf of what appeared to be architectural drawings . She placed several before him in silence . " What are those ? " she asked softly . He studied them . " A hospital ? Schools ? " She drew out a scrapbook . On the cover was pasted the head of the Christ child from the " Sistine Madonna . " The first pages were given over to portraits of Friedrich Froebel , and Jean-FredericOberlin . These were followed by cuttings from magazines and books  --  more ground plans and details of construction from hospitals , orphanages , hotels , villas , playgrounds . She laughed at his inquiring face . The guests in the restaurant laughed . " That 's my city of children . I 'm going to go all over the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Laughter . " Isolde has a husband and a lover and all she can think about is love , but there 's no word about children . Norma has some children and she prowls about with a dagger to kill them  --  just to spite their father . I think my city is going to be in Switzerlandby a lake with mountains all around us . And I 'm going to plant a grove of oak trees , like Papa 's . I 'm going to choose all the teachers myself .  --  Wo n't it be wonderful ? Ca n't you hear the children from here ? Now can you see why I 'm happy all the time ? " " Because of your plans . " At times these conversations became strained . Lily felt driven to review their childhood , to probe into " all that " at " The Elms . " Her judgments were without indulgence . Roger was not ready.  | " Lily , I do n't want to talk about those things . " " All right , I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what you men are like , but we girls do n't begin to live until we 're pretty clear in our heads about our fathers and mothers . " " Please change the subject , Lily . " Her eyes rested on him thoughtfully . To herself she said , " That 's Mama 's fault . " Another Sunday ( August ) : Roger asked that they meet for dinner on the following week after her evening service instead of at midday . " Roger , I 'm not free after evening service . After it 's over I go away with a friend of mine on his boat . Because of my work I ca n't go away on the weekend . We come back on Tuesday morning . On Monday he simply does n't show up at his office . He 's a good friend and a perfectly nice man and he teaches me things . He has a famous collection of paintings and sculpture and every Sunday night he brings some samples to the boat and lots of heavy books . " " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! No , indeed ! Someone younger .

" Laughter . " You see , I 'm going to have another baby  --  twins , I think . I ca n't explain it to the club or to my congregations , so I 'd better leave . " Roger waited . " He 'll be pretty glad to get rid of me , I think . Men get tired of me  --  not because I 'm horrid , but because they ca n't understand me . I make them uncomfortable . I 'm not impressed by the things that most men boast about . He 's all confused  --  he 's mortiried  --  because I wo n't accept even a little pearl pin from him .

You 're going to get to be well-known . Maybe I will . Let 's take our real names again . " " YEs ! " " And to make it double sure , let 's take our crazy middle names : the famous singer Scolastica Ashley , the rising newspaper man Berwyn Ashley . " " You 're a genius ! You 're a genius ! " She kissed him . She walked about the table twice . " I 've always hated all that huggermuggerabout invented names . I 'm Scolastica Ashley , the convict 's daughter , and if they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . Tomorrow ! Tomorrow ! I 'll begin tomorrow .  --  A letter from Papa , soon ! " " I think you should wait until after your concert . At your first concert you would n't want a lot of people gawking at you for that . Let 's do it the day after your concert . " Mrs. Temple 's concert was repeated ten days later by Miss Scolastica Ashley , who was also heard in Milwaukee , Madison , and Galena . Trent 's readers were informed that thereafter his articles would appear over his true name . The startling announcementcame too late to change the title page of Berwyn Ashley 's book Trent 's Chicago . Lily invited her mother to Chicago to attend the concert . She received an affectionate letter in return , wishing her great success . Her mother regretted that it was impossible for her to leave the boardinghouse at that time . " Roger , can I talk about Coaltown ? " " Yes . " " Papa did n't shoot Mr. Lansing . He did n't even shoot himp271by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know , but I 'm certain of it . I went to the Public Library and read the newspapersabout it  --  thousands and thousands of words . I was looking for an idea , but I could n't find a thing . But you can . Someday you can clear that up . There was one thing I noticed in those papers . They were full of what a fine man Mr. Lansing was  --  he ran the mine , he was head of all the clubs and lodges . You know that 's not true . He was a dreadful boastful creature . He was cheap , and I 'll bet he was lazy . We all pretended not to see it because we liked Mrs. Lansing so much . Roger , he must have had enemies . Maybe he was hard to the miners , maybe he was cruel to them . " Roger was following her gravely . He said slowly , " Porky knew everything that went on in town . He would have told me . " " Well , now I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one person  --  Miss Doubkov . " She told him about the anonymous letters . " It 's all nasty nonsense . Papa did n't go to Fort Barry oftener than once a year and he came back on the afternoon train . But I now think that many people in town really believed all that . It helps explain why so few people stood by Papa and why so few people came to see Mama . I think Mrs. Lansing must have got some of those letters , too  --  they were so full of hatred toward her .  --  Who was the mur-derer ? " " And who were the rescuers ? " The first Sunday in November : " Lily , you can say anything you want about the old days in Coaltown . " " I do n't want to , if it makes you uncomfortable . " " I 'll listen . I do n't have to agree with you , but I 'll listen . Shoot !  --  What was that you said  --  with a sneer  --  about Mama 's adoring Papa ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't say it with a sneer . It 's too serious . Roger , I 'm trying to get educated . I do n't think a person is free to learn any/thing until he 's begun to understand himself . And , as I said to you before , that includes understanding your father and mother . Mama worshiped Papa and as a result she was not a noticing person . Mama has many fine qualities , but Mama 's a very strange woman . " " So are you ! " Lily laughed the full octave and a half . " Yes , everybody at this table is strange . " " Go on with what you were saying . " " One day , months ago , the Maestro made his youngest daughter  --  Adriana  --  leavethe table . She 'd merely said that she adored her new shoes ; she thought they were divine . He said those were religious words and that they had nothing to do with shoes . He turned to me and said that they had nothing to do with human beings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives who adored one another . Such persons have n't grown up , he said . No human being is adorable . The early Hebrews were quite right to condemn idolatry . Women who adore their husbands throw a thousand little ropes around them . They rob them of their freedom . They lull them to sleep . It 's wonderful to own a god , to put him in your pocket . That day my education took a little jump forward . " She glanced at her brother 's face . It was hard and set . His eyes were angry and sullen , but he remained silent . " Do you realize that Mama had no friends ? She did n't dislikeMrs . Lansing . She did n't dislike Mrs. Gillies or Miss Doubkov . She spent hundreds  --  maybe thousands  --  of hours with them . She merely did n't care whether they existed or not . Mama cared for only one person in the world . She adored Papa .  --  One day I told the Maestro that I thought that most of the heroines in opera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . Opera is about greedy possessive passion . The girls make one mistake after another . They 're little whirlpools of destruction . First they bring death down on the baritones and basses  --  their fathers , guardians ,  |p273or  brothers ; then they bring it down on the tenors . Then at half past eleven they go mad , or stab themselves , or jump into a fire , or get strangled . Or they just expire . Self-centered possessive love . The women in the audience cry a little , but on the way home they 're already planning tomorrow 's dinner ! ' Papa loved Mama , but he did n't adore her . Papa was happy , but he missed something . After you left and Mama opened the boardinghouse  --  " " Sophie opened the boardinghouse ! " " Yes , Sophie did . I should have , but I was too stupid . Well , Sophie hired Mrs. Swenson to come back and help with the housework . I used to sit for hours in the kitchen , paring potatoes and stringing beans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some things about Papa . In the early years before that shooting  --  do you remember what time we had supper at " The Elms " ? We had it the latest of anybody in town  --  at six-thirty . We all thought that Papa had to finish up things at the mine . No , Papa got through at the mine at five and then he drove all over with that old horse . He called on the miners ' families ; then coming down the hill he visited homes . He 'd talk . He 'd repair things . He 'd fix pipes and flues . He 'd listen to people 's troubles . He 'd lend money . He 'd come driving into the barn at six-thirty exactly . But this is the point : he never told Mama about all these friends . Why ? There was nothing secretive about Papa . He simply did n't tell her because she would n't be interested . She was not a noticing woman and she was not a . . . a sympathizing woman . " Roger made no answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streetcar for the long drive south and east . The cars were crowded . Czech and Hungarian and Polish families going to visit their relativesbeside the steel mills ; Italian families going to visit their relatives in the marketgarden area around Codington . Families going for their last autumn Sunday at the Indiana dunes . Roger stood on the platform , a great weight about his heart . A mile of sandstone houses , homes . Miles of wooden houses , homes . Then farmhouses  --  apple trees in the yards , swings for the children  --   |p174homes  , families . They descended from the car in an Italian village . There remained half a mile to walk . They turned at the corner between a Farmacia Garibaldi and a Campo Sportivo Vittorio Emanuele . Roger 's depression had lifted . He gazed about him with a faint smile on his face . Good or bad , he was on the side of homes . He was filled with the resolve to have one of his own ,  --  damned soon , too . On this occasion Gianni had little attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had fairly well mastered walking and had taken up building . Being an Ashley he wanted no assistance . His mother and uncle sat in the grape arbor with glasses of wine before them , silent under the gift of the Indian summer , gazing across the long brown plain . The crops had been garnered . The soil had been turned . The day had begun with frost ; now in the somnolent heat a scarcely perceptible steam arose from the earth  --  a promise of renewal as compelling as those in the early days of April . Presently Gianni climbed on his mother 's lap and fell asleep . Roger began slowly : " Lily , the important thing is to be just . Even on the everyday level Mama was a remarkable mother of a family . Papa had very little money . We never knew we were poor . She worked all day , every day of her life . She was never short-tempered . She was never unfair . Even if it 's true that she felt no particular friendship for those ladies , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us the best books ; she played us the best music . But that 's only the smaller part of it . Not long ago the Maestro was talking to me after dinner in his studio . He said something like this : I 'm interested in your parents  --  yours and Lily 's  --  and in your ancestors . I 'm interested in your childhood . I 've taught more than a hundred young American men and women with fine voices . They 've sung well . Some of them are now famous . But they seldom really understand what they 're singing . Your sister comes to me . I teach her things about breathing and placement and so on , but in matters ofp275style and feeling and taste I have only to say a few words to her . Somewhere else she learned how to sing nobly . She can express grief without being sentimental . She can be angry without being coarse . ' He went on like that  --  oh , yes : he said , She can be coquettish without being vulgar . ' He wondered where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Think of her walking every day to that trial . Think of her on that morning when the police came stamping into the front hall asking who rescued Papa . Mama 's big . You owe her a debt as big as the Rocky Mountains . You got a lot of fine things from Papa , too , but we 'll talk about them another time ... . " We 've all got to be as we were made  --  as the dice fall out of the cup . We do n't know what Mama 's girlhood was like . I think that Papa rescued her from some difficult situation . I think what you call her adoration ' is some kind of unending gratitude , maybe . " " Mammi ! " " Si , caro . Che vuoi ? " " Mammi , canta ! " " Si , tesoro . " Lily sang softly the melody to which he was born . He fell asleep again . Roger went on : " In one way , Papa was like an animal . Can you see that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know they 're going to die . You did n't see him in court every day . How many times did you call on him in the jail ? " " Three times . " " It was n't merely being brave  --  for Mama and us . It was just being calm and simple about death  --  about life and death . " " I try to sing it . " " Look ! Look at the ducks going south ! " " Hundreds of them . " Pause . " Thousands ! "  | " A long time ago I heard Dr. Gillies make a speech , a kind of speech . It was in the Illinois Tavern on New Year 's Eve of 1899 . He said that evolution was going on and on . After a while  --  maybe millions of years  --  a new kind of human being will be evolved . All we see now is just a stage that humanity 's going through  --  possession and fear and cruelty . People will outgrow it , he said . " " Do you think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beautiful is the earth . He mumbled something . He put out his hand and enclosed Gianni 's dusty foot . " I did n't hear you , Roger . " " Oh , one would have to live ten thousand years to notice any change . One must feel it inside  --  that is , believe it . " Gianni awoke and wanted to go to his uncle . Roger hurled him up to the leafy roof of the arbor ; he swung him between his legs ; he hung him up by his heels . Gianni screamed between terrorand ecstasy . Women do n't play such games . He returned , chastened , to his mother 's lap . He was n't sure  --  until next time  --  whether he loved his Uncle Roshi or not . Roger , still standing , continued to gaze at the fields . " I 've been reading . . . . Fifty years ago in Bengal a hundred thousand peasants made a bare subsistence from weaving cotton . Soon the British government forbade them to do any weaving ; Manchester was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on all fours and groped for roots and bulbs to eat . Slow starvation , malformation , and death . The Civil War breaks out . No cotton for Manchester . Terrible times in Manchester  --  slow starvation , malformation , and death . After the war the routes are open again , but improvements in mechanical processes have eliminated twenty workers for every one that 's kept on . The Negroes get down on all fours and grope for roots and bulbs . Slow starvation , malnutrition , and death . . . . The world 's getting smaller . Too many people . Nobody can manage it . "  | " Mammi , canal " Lily looked at him woefully . " What 's the answer , Roger ? Ca n't I have my ten children ? " He returned to his bench . His eyes met hers without a smile . He said sadly : " I 'll let all Ashleys live . " Lily put her son on the ground . She knelt at Roger 's feet and clasped her hands on his knees . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all this for us . I beg you  --  in Papa 's name  --  in Gianni 's name  --  " A strange thing happened . Roger  --  Roger Ashley !  --  burst into tears . He arose and walked up and down the road . " Mammi , canal " Lily sang . Many times she sang the emotion that filled her on that afternoon  --  in Milan , in Rio , in Barcelona . . . in Manchester . Roger returned to her , smiling . " I 'm going to Coaltown for Christmas , " he said . Roger left Chicago at noon on the twenty-third of December . He felt no elation , he even fancied he was ill . He had had little rest and no vacation in two and a half years . He was encumbered with luggage , which included his and Lily 's Christmas presents . He put them on the racks above him and settled down in a seat at the back of the car . He was never without a book . He opened Bagehot 's Lombard Street and began underlining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraph twice . He fell asleep . Many hours later he was awakened by noise and movement in the car . The train was receiving and discharging passengers at Fort Barry . A few minutes later it moved south for a quarter of a mile to the refueling station and came to a long halt . This was where his father had been rescued two years and five months before . Most of the passengers descended from the cars and walked briskly up and down the cinder path beside the water tank and the coal sheds . There were many students on the trainp278returning home for the holidays ; they sang . The light was fading . A few snowflakes hovered in the air . Roger 's spirits revived . He scanned the faces of those who strolled by him . His attention was attracted by a tall thin girl of about his own age who had separatedherself from her companions and was walking rapidly to and fro . Her eyes and complexion were dark . She wore a sealskin cap and a collar of the same fur rose above her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An indefinable grace and distinctioninvested her . He stopped and looked across the ditch toward the clump of trees where  --  it was said  --  his father 's rescuershad given him a horse . He resumed his walk . The girl in the sealskin hat passed him twice , then stopped before him and said : " Roger , I want to talk to you about something . " " I beg your pardon ? " " Not here  --  but when we 're in Coaltown . " " I beg your pardon , but I do n't know who you are . " " I 'm Felicite Lansing . " " Felicite ! You 've grown ! " " Yes . " " I 'm very glad to see you . How 's your mother ? " " She 's well . " " How are you all ? How 's George and Anne ? " " They 're well . Roger , I want to talk to you about something . " Her manner was grave and urgent . Suddenly he remembered that Sophia had written that Felicite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was something nunlike in the young woman before him : that absence of calling any attention to herself . " What is it you want to say , Felicite ? " " It 's something very important about . . . your father and my father . " She looked over his shoulder , as at some woeful ordeal that must be met and surmounted . " Yes , Felicite . I think now we can find two seats side by side on the train . "  | " I ca n't tell you about it now . I 'm not ready . Maybe what I have to tell you is very terrible . I did n't know that I 'd be meeting you this way  --  on the train . " " I 'll come to your house tomorrow , or you come to my house . " Felicite continued to gaze , pondering , beyond him , though not in evasion of his glance ; when she looked into his face it was without reservation . Roger 's heart leapt in recognition : her eyes , like her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother she had a mole on her right cheekbone . She said : " Until I 'm sure of what I have to tell you  --  very sure  --  my mother must n't know it ; or your mother . George came back three nights ago .

I have to tell you . I have n't been able to tell them to anybody . " Again she gazed over his shoulder in silence . To himself Roger said : " But I know her . We must have said thousands of words to one another . " " I 've read some of the essays you wrote for the paper . Miss Doubkov lent them to me . I think you 'll understand .

Can you come there tomorrowmorning at half past ten ? " " Filly ! Filly ! You 'll be left behind ! " " Yes , I can . " The hazel and the blue of her eyes seemed to darken . " Maybe it 's not true .

" What a girl ! " Felicite sat motionless on the aisle ; her companions babbled and fluttered about her like doves . Their voices were shrill with the excitement of the coming holiday . He heard their insistent " Filly " this and " Filly " that . Roger said to himself : " I shall marry that girl . "  |p283Hoboken  , New Jersey , is a town bearing a Dutch name , once largely inhabited by people of German descent . The majority of the houses were of red brick , agreeably shaded by locust and linden trees . In good weather the citizens of Hoboken enjoyed ( and still enjoy ) sitting on benches along the waterfront watching the ships entering and leaving New York harbor . A great deal of beer was brewed and drunk in Hoboken , but the consumption in the various beer halls was sedate and ruminative rather than boisterous . The town contained an engineering school . Most of its studentscame from a distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they wished to enjoy themselves they took the ferry to New York , where " life " was reported to abound . One Sunday morning in the spring of 1883 John Ashley , twenty-one years old , was sitting on a waterfront bench with Beata Kellerman , nineteen , daughter of one of the more prosperous brewers . He was wearing the new suit that he had bought for Easter . It was green  --  almost " bottle green . " His domed hat was brown . His new shoes were yellow and shone . He wore a high stiff collar . The lapels on his light tan overcoat were of plumcoloredvelvet . These were the clothes of a rich man 's son , but they were ill-chosen and suggested the country boy . At no timep284in his life was there anything remarkable to observe in John Ashley except his large nose , his attentive blue eyes , and his taciturnity . He was neither dark nor light , tall nor short , fat nor thin , handsome nor homely . His taciturnity did not proceed from shyness . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to miss anything . He was constantly filled with wonder : mathematics and the laws of physics were wonderful ; a day like this Sunday morning was wonderful ; wonderful were the ships before him , the sea gulls , the clouds in the sky and the laws of vaporization that governed them ; it was wonderful to be young with a long crowded life before him . Above all the girl beside him was wonderful . She would be his wife and they would have many wonderful children . Beata 's clothes also gave evidence of a rich father  --  from the high-buttoned shoes on her large feet to the fringed parasol in her mittened hand . Beata , however , arrested attention . She was a German version of a Greek goddess  --  " Junoesque , " said her drawing master  --  with wide-set prominent blue eyes , a splendid nose , and a full cushioned chin . Beata , too , was taciturn , but for different reasons . She had recently emerged from a life in which nothing was wonderful . She had learned to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On that morning Hoboken was very quiet . Not even church bells were heard , for an epidemic was at its height and the churches were closed . The disease had recurred for many years with varying symptoms and under different names . In 1883 it was called the " Maryland pneumonia . " Door after door bore the purple notice of infection and some the crepe of mourning . Many students had been withdrawn by their parents from the Institute . John Ashley , too , had been summoned home , but had turned a deaf ear . He was the only child of doting parents in upper New York State . Idolized sons are not noted for gratitude or obedience . He had , in addition , little acquaintance with fear . He believed that illness and accident are apportioned to those who deserve them . He was now living in an empty house . The family with whom he boarded had fled the town and were making their home with relatives on a farmp285in Pennsylvania . Beata 's family had driven to church in New York City and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had solemnly promised her parents that they would not leave the house during the day . She was presumably sitting in the parlor practicinga sonata by Beethoven with a brazier of smoking sulphur beside her . She was an exceptionally obedient daughter . Beata had spent her life in a prison house of many fears ; from these her love for John Ashley had recently freed her . She no longer feared her mother or the mockery of her brothers and sisters or the opinion of her mother 's friends . Above all she had been freed from a fear of life itself  --  a confused dread of " men " and " babies , " and of an eternity of days spent in Hoboken . Within six weeks John Ashley had dispersed all these clouds . The crown of her love for him was gratitude . John and Beata sat on the bench in the plague-stricken town . They looked at the sunlight on the water . They spoke little . Any words but the most commonplace would disturb the mounting music that filled them. " .. . a wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We fashion our lives by the operation of our imaginations , or  --  as Goethe said  --  " Beware what you long for in your youth , for you will get it in your middle age , " by which we presume he meant that we shall get it or some botched caricature of it . John Ashley 's imagination was limited in some areas , but not in this : he wanted to be a husband and the father of many children ; he wanted to be married by the age of twenty-two so that his older children would be passing through the teens before he was forty ; he wanted to live at a distance from the Atlantic coast in a large house surrounded by verandahs  --  a house somewhat untidy , perhaps , because of the tumult of life within it , all those young boys and girls ; he wanted a workshop near the house , filled with the proper tools and equipment , in which he could perform his experiments and make his useful and useless inventions .

He had a fairly clear picture of his future wife : she would be beautiful and very nearly perfect  --  that is , without vanity , envy , malice , or deference to the opinion of others . She would be an exemplary housewife . She would be , like himself , slow to speak , but endowed with a beautiful speaking voice  --  that of his doting mother managed to be both nasal and flat . There were other elements in Ashley 's picture of his future that were less clear to him , but he was in no doubt about the first steps . He would lead his classes , thereby being enabled to select on graduation the job that most suited him . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was to reside in Hoboken for four years he resolved to search for a wife in the community . On his trips to New York he kept his eyes well open . The girls in the city seemed to him to be invested with a fatiguing vivacity ; they never stopped talking ; they laughed too loudly in public and they waved their hands about in the air . A small-town boy himself , he wished to marry a small-town girl. " ... ' t 's so peaceful ! " " Yes . Yes , it is . " John Ashley led all his classes and was president of his fraternity , but he took little interest in his fellow students . ( He resigned from the house in his senior year and moved into private lodgings . ) He was naturally endowed for sports , but did not engage in them . He lacked any competitive sense and appeared to lack ambition . But he was never idle ; he explored the laws of mechanics and electricity , and he hunted women . He intimidated his professors . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a student who approached mechanics inp287the spirit of play . They gave him enlarged space in the laboratory and furnished him with expensive equipment . The energy it engenderedrang bells ( they played " ' Nita , Juanita " ) and threw numerals and letters on a grid from a clavier . He came near killing himself a number of times ; he blew out windows , blackened ceilings , and almost reduced the laboratory to ashes ; but grave accidents do not befall young Ashleys . His special laboratory privileges were regretfully withdrawn . As graduation approached the Dean and a number of his advisers discussed inviting the young man to join the faculty , but voices were raised against the appointment . " Inventors " were suspect and it was obvious that Ashley was of that sort . However , they hung his mechanical drawings in the school 's corridors  --  they were of unprecedented clarity and beauty and remained there for years  --  and wrote handsomeletters of recommendation on his behalf . Ashley also played with mechanics at his lodgings . His room resembled some eccentricscientist 's cavern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawn , the hands of his clock reached five-thirty a pillow fell from the ceiling on his face ; in cold weather a long steel arm lowered the window , another lit a burner under a tea kettle . He played withmathematics . There were always six to ten card games in progress at his fraternity house . He drew up charts analyzing the prob-abilities governing whist , Jack Gallagher , and pinochle . Since he had no competitive sense , no malice , and no need of money , his interest in the card games was limited to preventing any one member of the group from winning overmuch . If these activities reflected the spirit of play , his search for a wife was very serious indeed . He was interested only in girls of strict upbringing . An earnest hunter studies the terrain , observesthe habits , runs , and feeding grounds of his quarry ; he fits himself out with appropriate equipment and arms himself with patience . Soon after his arrival in Hoboken he began laying his plans . He enrolled as a student of the German language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general rule among thep288prosperous German families that their daughters would have nothing to do with the students at the Institute , and it was commonknowledge at the Institute that the girls of Hoboken were heavy-footed " Dutchies , " unworthy of a lively young man 's attention . But John Ashley never waited to form his opinions on those of his contemporaries ; his aims were above their vision and his methods beyond their patience . He followed girls on the street and learned their names and addresses . He was welcomed at the church . Introduction led to introduction . He was invited to Sundaydinners . He , in turn , invited girls ( and their mothers ) to lectures with lantern slides  --  " Our December Sky , " " Goethe and die Tiere "  --  and to minstrel shows . At the close of these entertainmentsthere was much shaking of hands in the aisles and further introductions . There were dances and balls in Hoboken long before dancing was accepted in similar communities elsewhere . He threw a wide net . Girl led to girl . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stalked by faith . The hunt was time consuming , but we all have time to expend on what is essential to our nature . Finally  --  late , when he had almost given up hope , in the second quarter of his senior year  --  he saw Beata Kellerman . A month later he was introduced to her . Three months later he eloped with her . Mysterious are the laws of sexual selection . Ashley chose Beata to be his wife much as his son Roger was to choose his life 's career  --  by elimination . He was a favorite with the mothers and younger sisters ; the fathers and brothers found him uninteresting . Naturally , he kept a score card . Trude Gruber and Lisl Grau liked him very much , but they could not restrain themselves from laughingat him . Everyone could see that the other Grau twin , Heidi , was a little in love with him , but she was given to saying that she hated cooking and sewing and " all those stupid Haus f rau things .

In his third year it seemed to him that he had found what he was looking for  --  Marianne Schmidt . On Sunday afternoons they sat on the benches and watched the ships entering and leaving New York Harbor . Marianne was seventeen , beautiful , slow to speak , and thoughtful . She possessed the unusual ability to make Ashley talk . She wanted to know what he was learning at the Institute . Finally she confided that she wished to go to Mt . Holyoke College in Massachusetts to study chemistry . She planned to be a " lady doctor " to treat children . She had read that in Germany and France a woman could become a doctor  --  a real doctor , like a man . Ashley listened to her for a while , then ventured a reply . Marianne was unable at first to understand what he was saying . She could n't believe her ears . It seemed that he thought it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then who 'd do it ? " " Well . . .

" Let 's go home , john . . . . John , sometimes I think that you 're just plain ignorant  --  or rather that something was left out of you . You have n't any  --  imagination ! You have n't any  --  ! " That eliminated Marianne Schmidt . Lottchen Bauer had a beautiful speaking voice and was a famous cook . One day he took her skating on the Turnverein 's rink . They skated together with such elegance that the crowd left the ice to watch them . When at the end of the afternoon he was taking off her skates he looked up and found that she was weeping . " Why , Lottchen ! What 's the matter ? " " Nothing . " " Tell me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrel with Father and Motherp290this morning and I 'm going to have another one tonight .  --  John , you said you thought I sang beautifully . " " You do . You 're the best home singer I ever heard . " " Well , I want to be an opera singer and I 'm going to be anopera singer and nothing in the wide world will stop me ! " " But , Lottchen ! " " What ? " " I do n't think you 'd have a very good family life , if you were an opera singer . I mean : you 'd have to be away evenings a lot . And I guess they must have to practice on the afternoons before the show . " Lottchen wept some more , but from prolonged laughter . That eliminated Lottchen Bauer . He was taken to the annual concert given by the pupils of Hoboken'sforemost teacher of the piano , Mrs. Kessel . Music , application , and composed nerves came naturally to these girls . Pupil followed pupil . The evening drew toward its close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three Misses Kellerman . Ashley had seen these young ladies , but had never met them . Their mother Clotilde Kellerman , geborene von Diehlen , regarded herself as superior to the other matrons in the town and held her daughters in closer rein . Beata played last . Ashley had no way of discerning that her performance was the most brilliant but the least innately musical of the evening . It reflected not her beauty but her stony advance to the piano and her withdrawn salute to the audience . In the middle of it  --  her memory failed her . The public was electrified . This was a scandal and a disgrace and would be talked about for years . Ashley was more electrified by what followed . Beata did not recommence the work ; she did not grope about among the keys for an issue . She gazed tranquilly before her , her hands raised . Then she rose and bowed to her listeners , unabashed . She left the stage with the carriage of a world-famous artist who has exceeded all expectations . The applause was gen/erous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's friends . " She did it on purpose ! " " Her mother will die ! " " She 's an awful stuck-up girl and everybody knows it ! She has n't got any friends and she does n't want any . " " She did it to spite her mother . She 's impossible to her mother . " " No , she did n't do it on purpose . When she recited on Schiller 's birthday she forgot the words , too . " What was it in Beata that so strongly attracted Ashley from these first moments ? Was it her fortitude and imperturbability ? Did he have sufficient imagination to capture in the air the cry as of one shipwrecked and drowning ? Was his attention quickened toward her because of the malicious glee in the audience ? ( He was tending to believe that community opinion is always wrong . ) Did he see himself as a Perseus and St. George whose mission it had been to rescue a beautiful maiden in distress ? Or was it in his nature to seek a girl who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-absorbedly , him alone ? He stalked her . The family generally attended church in New York and spent the whole Sunday there . They seldom patronizedthe entertainments in Hoboken . He learned that in school she had been a formidably bright student ; she knew " oceans " of German poetry by heart ; she and her sisters spoke impeccable French ( their mother directed that only French be spoken in the home on Fridays  --  which left their base-born father out in the cold ) . She was widely disliked . She was cruelly teased by her brothers and sisters  --  for her aloofness , for her disdain of boys , for her large feet . The matrons lowered their voices with assumed sympathy to declare that she was " unmarriageable . " Once a year  --  sturdy Protestants though they were  --  the brewersof Hoboken gave a great pre-Lenten ball ( their Fasching , theirp292Mardi Gras ) in honor of King Gambrinus , the inventor of beer . John Ashley , the hunter , attended with the Gruber family . He never failed to be attentive to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced to Beata , who had been dancing with her brothers . She refused his invitation to dance . An hour later he sat down by the great Mrs. Kellerman . He talked of the weather and of the band . By luck he happened to mention that he had recently crossed the river to attend a performance of Der Freischiitz at The Academy of Music . The Kellermans had held a Saturday-afternoon subscription to the opera for twenty years . Mrs. Kellerman unbent . She invited him to dinner on the following Thursday night . She wanted him to meet her sons , one of whom was thinking of enrolling in the engineering school . Ashley again asked Beata to dance and was refused . ( Later she told him that she had been aware of his following her and that she had " hated " him . ) On Thursday evening , Beata was indisposedand did not join the family at dinner . Her father and brothers thought him uninteresting ; her sisters thought him ridiculous . Mrs. Kellerman liked him very much . He had beautiful manners . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her childhood home in Hamburg , the great balls she had attended , the royalties to whom she had been presented . Two days later he went to New York and bought a keepsake edition of Heine 's Buch der Lieder , bound in coral velvet , stamped with forget-me-nots . He had consulted his German professor on this important matter . He brought it to her door . Hunters leave cakes of salt in the forest . For three weeks he received no reply . Despair defends itself . Finally he was invited to coffee . That thicket of briars through which Beata groped her life away vanished into thin air . Why ? How ? He made no jokes . He did n't allude to anything in mockery . He spoke of her loss of memory at the piano . He said he understood that perfecly : that beauiful music was one thing , but thatp293a lot of people sitting in little gold creaky chairs listening to their relatives play was another . He bet that she played perfectly when she was alone or with just one or two people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked . He told her he planned to leave the East Coast and to work in the West where he did n't know anybody . He lowered his voice to confess that he loved his father and mother , but they did n't really have the same ideas that he had . He dropped into German : " I get along pretty well here . I get along pretty well wherever I am . But I have the feeling that I want to get away from everything that I 've known . I want to start a whole new life . Do you sometimes feel like that ? " Beata was unable to speak . " The Constitution of the United States says that we have a right to be happy . I 've been happy  --  whenever I stayed at my grandmother 's farm in upper New York State . But she died . I could be happy with you . You could make me happy . I could try to make you happy . " She gazed at him unblinkingly  --  blue eyes into blue . A hoarsenesscame into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't make anyone happy . " He smiled . Slowly a smile filled his face that so seldom smiled . " Well , " he said , " we could think about it . " Here begins a history of the maternal grandparents of the notorious Ashley children . There is a theory  --  the folk wisdom of many countries has condensed the observation into a proverb  --  that gifted children inherit from their grandparents , that talents skip a generation . Some maintain that that is all nonsense : energy of mind ( for good or ill ) in persons and nations is primarily the result of a mixture of contrasting traits in the inheritance  --  a turbulent clash . The Ashley children and the Lansing children certainly had energy of mind , but the Ashley children had something more : ap294quality of abstraction , an impersonal passion . Where did that come from  --  that freedom from self-reference ? Friederich Kellerman and his bride Clotilde , geborene von Diehlen , arrived in America from Hamburg twenty-five years before this beautiful and soundless morning in Hoboken . Kellerman had risen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science of brewing . He was stout , amiable , pusillanimous , and musical . His wife was of another metal . She had a straight back , the carriage of a royal guardsman . Her intimidated neighbors said she looked like a weather vane , or like the figurehead on a ship  --  allusions to her high coloring , to her red cheeks , tufted orange eyebrows and braids , eyes of sapphire en cabochon . She entered public gatherings like a beadle directing a state funeral . She had been brought up in a household where parents and children ( and their grandparents before them ) were breathlessly absorbed in improving their social position . Her father had held a position on the administrative staff of Hamburg 's Marine Institute , without being Professor or even Doktor ; he was merely paymaster and superintendent of buildings and grounds . At some time in the eighteenth century  --  when many were doing it  --  his family had picked up a von to which they were not entitled . The von Diehlens were occasionally given cards to academic and municipal balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid her eyes on royalties and had made her " Knix . " She and her sisters had been taught by their mother with a sort of ferocity to imitate those Exalted Personages . They were made to ascend and descend staircases with Beethoven 's Sonatas or atlases on their heads , to rise from a curtsy without an audible cracking of their knees , and to waltz entire evenings without reversing . Snobberyis a passion . It is a noble passion that has gone astray amid appearances . It springs from a desire to escape the trivial and to be included among those who have no petty cares , no tediousp295moments , among those whose very misfortunes are lofty . On starry nights the geese around the ponds below our barns hear in the upper airs the song of their migrant cousins . They imagine that all their diversions are magical ; they never experience selfdistasteand boredom . Clotilde 's marriage to Friederich Kellerman had been a disappointment to her family and was soon to be one to her . She could not forgive herself for having married a brewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her quality was seldom discerned , for having been betrayed by love into joiningher life with that of a handsome young workman possessed of a resounding baritone voice and an easy assurance that he would be a success  --  one who spoke a deplorable German and one who would never , never , look well on horseback . Clotilde Kellerman , however , held her head high and looked straight ahead . She sustained the pretense of deference to the head of the house . Her children were not deceived . Perhaps the principal reason for Beata 's revolt against her mother was that lady 's tacit but sufficiently evident disparagement of the man she had married . Clotilde Kellerman had other passions , too , or tended other altars . She loved her family collectively , while being in a constant state of exasperation with each individual in it . They were hers . She would have walked into a wall of fire for any one of them . Housekeeping , for her  --  like the aspiration to a higher social rank  --  was invested with moral values . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her . Beata was to remember all her life the occasion when her mother gazed for a moment at the roast which her maid had placed before her at the Sunday dinner table , then had seized it in both hands and hurled it to the floor . Her gesture was forceful , her voice was contained : " Tell Kathe we shall have scrambled eggs . " The von Diehlens transmitted a third passion from generation to generation , though it reached Clotilde Kellerman in an attenuated form . To them music , nightly in the home and at least twice a week at concerts , was essential to existence . Neither Clotildep296nor her daughter Beata was musical , but they did not know that . They thought they were . Many color-blind persons are unaware that the world they see differs from that seen by their neighbors . They wept at slow movements ; they recognized well-defined themes and rejoiced at their recurrence . Beata 's father , however , had an ear . In Hoboken he was long the president of the best ( of four ) Sangervereine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs . He grew tired of hearing forty obese men proclaim the joys of a hunter 's life and bid passing birds report their breaking hearts to their beloved . He took his family to the opera in New York and wept unashamedly through the works of Wagner . His wife was very pleased to be there , though she gave little attention to the performance . She was handsome and she knew it , and very well born ; it was her duty to be present and it conferred a ( fivehour ) privilege on those who beheld her . Friederich Kellerman was deeply attached to his children and particularly to Beata , but his wife held strong views on parental relations . She was quick to intercept any demonstrations of tenderness . They rendered boys unmanly and girls vulgar . At mealtimes the children stood behind their chairs until their parents were seated ; on going to bed they kissed their parents ' hands . At heart Clotilde Kellerman had a low opinion of girls . God sent them into the world for the perpetuation of the race , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inculcate a spine of steel , a royal carriage , a thorough knowledge of cooking , bedding , and cleaning , and to find them a husband from an estimable family . It should not be forgotten , however , that Clotilde had also acquired the merits , real or imagined , of aristocrats : never , in the presence of her children , did she say a malicious word about her neighbors . ( She had other ways of conveying disapprobation . ) Though she could cast a platter to the floor , she never raised her voice nor permitted her children to do so . She let it be known that she was guided by her own opinion rather than by those of her neighbors . She did not permit any discussion of the relative wealth or poverty of theirp297friends . If her husband had entered the house one day and told her that he was bankrupt , she would have uttered no word of complaint . She would have moved to a slum and improved the tone of the neighborhood . Beata was an exemplary student , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ von Diehlen and Kellerman ) , an accomplished performer on the piano , a superb cook ( von Diehlen ) . She gave all of herself to whatever task was set before her ( Kellerman ) . She did n't give a pin for her beauty , possibly because she thought her older sisters were more beautiful . Young men left her alone . There was no one to whom she could extend affection ; her dog was run over , her cat kittened . She had approached on tiptoe the possibility that she might acknowledge her love for her father and receive any , any , recognition in return . She tried to send some kind of message to him  --  the waving of a scarf from a quicksand ; but Friederich Kellerman was powerless . He suggested to his wife that Beata might be sent to one of those women 's colleges . " Nonsense ! I do n't know where you get such ideas , Fritz ! Do you know what those girls wear ? They wear bloomers ! " Beata became not sullen but stony . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her rescue just in time . She might have held out a year or two longer without turning to stone . Maybe he was a year or two late . We are not permitted to tease ourselves with these conditionals . The same starvation that warps one strengthens another . Why was Beata an unhappy misfit in her own family ? Becauseshe had been formed by her parents ' best principles and insights and her parents did not recognize them when they saw them . Parents grow old . What we have called their creativity ( there is a home-building , child-rearing " creativity " ) loses its keenness . They are " feather-plucked " in the commerce of life . Family life is like a hall endowed with the finest acoustical properties . Growing children hear not only their parents ' words ( andp298in most cases gradually ignore them ) , they hear the intentions , the attitudes behind the words . Above all they learn what their parents really admire , really despise . John Ashley was quite right in wishing to be under forty when his children were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was ten  --  that is to say they were beginning to be resigned to the knowledge that life was disappointing and basically meaningless ; they were busily clutching at its secondary compensations : the esteem and ( hopefully ) the envy of the community in so far as they can be purchased by money and acquired by circumspect behavior , by an unremitting air of perfect contentment , and by that tone of moral superiority that bores themselves and others but which is as important as wearing clothes . As I shall have occasion to say when we consider the early years of Eustacia Lansing : all young people secrete idealism as continuously as the Bombyx mori secretes silk . It is as necessary to them as food that life be filled with wonder  --  that they contemplateheroes . They must admire . They must admire . The boy in the reformatory ( his third conviction for burglary with assault ) secretes idealism as a Bombyx mori secretes silk . The girl of fifteen , brutalized into prostitution , secretes idealism  --  for a while  --  as a Bombyx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brightly lighted stage where they will be called upon to play roles exhibiting courage , fair dealing , magnanimity , wisdom , and helpfulness . Hoping and trembling a little , they feel that they are almost ready for these great demands upon them . In the fine acoustics of the family life Beata had imbibed from both parents a number of summonses to perfection  --  the responsibility and decorum of the aristocrat , and the probity and the quickness to resent oppression of the working classes . All virtues ( even humility ) invoke independence . Beata 's mother , growing old , was relapsing into the vices of the aristocratic view of life . Beata 's father , when young , had transmitted to his favorite daughter the virtues that had invested his family for generations ;  |p299aging  ( at forty-four ) he had become rudderless and obsequious . Beata 's refusal to be concerned with attempts to impress the neighbors exasperated her mother ; her refusal to be coerced disappointedher father . She was isolated and wretched . John and Beata , then , were sitting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters of New York Harbor . A breeze sprang up . The ruffles on Beata 's bertha fluttered in the air . " Are you cold , Beata ? " " No . No , John . " He looked at her . Smiling , she glanced into his eyes , then lowered her own . Slowly she raised them and looked steadily into his . We remember his grandmother 's warning against looking long into the eyes of a child or an animal . Hitherto these young persons had stolen quick glances at one another  --  blue eyes into the blue  --  of an almost painful sweetness and confusion . In daily life the reciprocal glance is brief ; a little prolonged it is the confirmationof mature confidence or the mark of resolute antagonism . Boys play a game of outstaring one another ; it soon breaks up in semihysterical laughter and a release of coltish energy . They tell us of actors experiencing a mounting panic when they are required to prolong the pose on the stage or before the camera . It is  --  as the photographers say  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolution of pride and separateness ; it is surrender . John and Beata gazed into one another 's eyes . A force they had not foreseen took possession of them . It lifted their hands ; it joined their lips ; it drew them along the walk into the town . He had not planned it . She did not distrust it . Without words they found their way to his empty house . Two months later they left Hoboken together ; thereafter , for nineteen years , they were seldom separated for longer than twenty-four hours  --  until he was taken to jail . On the evening following his graduation Beata left herp300home while her parents were entertaining friends in the front parlor . At first dark she had hidden a coat , a hat , and a small handbag under the kitchen steps . John and Beata were never married . There was no time for it then , and a suitable occasion never presented itself . John happened to have found a bride as independent of tribal forms as himself . Rites are instituted to aid and support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set with a garnet . John removed the stone and filed away the setting . " Shall we go and find someone and get married , Beata ? " " I am married . " They arrived a few days later in Toledo , Ohio . They had stopped on the way to see the Niagara Falls . The firm that had engaged John had not been informed that he was married , but a cordial welcome was extended to the young couple and when Lily was born six months later she received many gifts in the shape of blankets , spoons , pushers , and silver mugs . During the epidemic in Hoboken those who were shut in acquired an intensified interest in whatever could be seen from their windows . Beata 's visits to the house where John lived were observed and reported . But for a long time no one dared mention them to the redoubtable Clotilde Kellerman . She was the last to learn of them . Thereafter she did not permit Beata 's name to be mentioned in her presence . It would be difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning following his graduation he accompanied them to New York and saw them off on the train . He would write . At Christmas he sent them a card without return address . He did not tell them that he was married and a father . John Ashley wanted all things new . He must be the first man who has earned his bread , to take a wife , to beget a child . Everythingis filled with wonder  --  a bride , a first salary cheque , the infant in one 's arms . To announce these things to persons whop301think they are everyday occurrences is to endanger one 's own sense of their radiance . Besides , he had had enough of advice and warning , of being commended for what a dolt could do and being ridiculed for what was hard won , for being urged to admire what he despised  --  his father 's anxiety-ridden prudence  --  and being asked to deplorewhat he admired  --  his grandmother 's idiosyncratic independence . He had had enough of being a son . His first year of marriage was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half an octave . He walked the mile to his place of work like Adam going forth to his daily task of naming the plants and animals . On the first half mile he was filled with a storm of tenderness for what he left behind ; on the second , with the gravity of one who has founded the human race and must foster and defend it . It made him uncomfortable to think that perhaps his happiness rendered him conspicuous . He had the sensation that he " shone . " ( " Good morning , Jack . How are you ? " " Fine , Bill , how are you ? " ) His natural taciturnity increased . That fear abated . No one noticed . The one disappointment in his new life was the nature of his job . The machine tools he was set to design turned out to involve small changes on established patterns . He called his work " making cookie molds . " There was no opportunity to fashion a new thing or to explore his own skills . By a coincidence ( but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he heard of the position to be filled at Coaltown . The pay was poor , but the description of what would be required of him was inviting . He was replacing a " maintenance engineer " who had just died at eighty-two . The letter was signed " Breckenridge Lansing . " So , after two years and two months in Ohio , the Ashleys journeyed to southern Illinois , to a life which turned out to be filled with wonder and delight and many coincidences . When they descended from the train at Coaltown 's depot in September , 1885 , John Ashleywas twenty-three , Lily almost two , and Roger nine months old.  |p302Each  of the Ashley children was  --  because of the peculiar components in an Ashley  --  what Lily called " exhaustingly notorious " ; but their separate fames were " exhaustingly " enhanced by the fact that they were brother and sisters . The admiration or antagonism they aroused was tripled ; the curiosity , centupled . On one level the Sunday supplements of the newspapers published lurid stories ( " Have the Ashleys a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) ; humorists strained themselves . On another , there were popular biographies of them . On another , amateur and professionalgenealogists went to extraordinary pains to trace their ancestors . Articles and brochures appeared in several languages . Presentation copies were sent to the subjects of these works , who had firmly refused to furnish any information concerning themselves . At first , Constance threw them into wastepaper baskets unread ; Lily and Roger directed their secretaries to thank the authors for their interest . John Barrington Ashley 's immediate ancestors were farmers and small merchants on the western banks of the Hudson River . As Ashley , Ashleigh , Coghill , Barrington , Barrow , and so on , they had left the Thames Valley in the 1660 's , fleeing from religiouspersecution , and had crossed the Atlantic . For every head of a family of their persuasion and condition who steeled himself to this resolve there were ten who wavered , longed , and shrank back . ( " Brother Wilkins , will ye remove with us ? " ) Once arrived at the shores of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meetinghouse and the school ; then pushed further . ( In the seventeenth century they were saying : " If you can see the smoke from your neighbor 's chimney , you 're too near . " In the eighteenth they accommodated themselves , not without some stiffness , to living in a community . ) They were steeled on the Lord 's day by four-hour sermons that were largely occupied with sin . ( " Oh my beloved brothers and sisters , consider what a terrible thing it is to fall into the hands of an angry God ! " ) Most of the households had known a dozen children , not including thep303early lost . ( The patriarch sleeps on the hill with his several brides beside him . ) Some of the Ashley clan married into the Scots and Dutch families across the river . The Dutch families came from Amsterdam . One genealogist found an Espinosa in the line and claimed a connection with the philosopher , but there were many Espinosa-Spinozas among the Sephardim who had escaped from religious persecution in Spain . The parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived in Montrealfrom a village near Tours on the Loire . ( " Dis , cousin Jacques ! Est-ce que to viens avec noun a Quebec  --  oui ou non ? " ) Beata 's ancestors were farmers , artisans , and burghers from northern Germany . Her mother 's grandmother was of a Huguenot family , weavers who had fled from religious persecution in France at the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes . They had found refuge in several of the proud and independent Hanseatic ports . Names , hundreds of names , names from records in the town halls , church registers , from last testaments , from gravestones . Lily sent one of these brochures to Roger : " I wish they 'd hurry and find my Italian ancestors . I know I 'm Italian . And I know I 'm Irish .  --  But what 's the use of all this ink ? " Roger replied : " I wish I could read the annals of your descendants , and Connie 's and mine . " Those annals contain Gaels and Wops aplenty . ( The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : handsome , dashing . ) This varied documentation could be found in any large library and was at the disposal of anyone who applied for it . Soon a new kind of attention was brought to bear on the material : There was very little intellectual heritage uncovered for the Ashleys . There were some schoolmasters and clergymen in the Coghill , McPhaill , and Van Dyke  --  Huysum lines . A great-greatgrandmotherof John Ashley was the daughter of Loris Vanderloo , the Dutch seaman whose Voyages to China and Japan ( 1770 ) were widely read . There was no evidence of gentle birth . Clotilde von Diehlen 's presumptions were not sustained . A diligent search wasp304made for an inheritance of musical endowment . Friederich Kellerman'spresidency of the choral society in Hoboken was noted . There was a tradition in the von Diehlen family that an ancestor named Kautz had served as cellist in Frederick the Great 's orchestra at Potsdam . It was confirmed . The unhappy Kautz had suffered from melancholia and had taken his own life . It was discovered that the Ashleys drew upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a notable tendency to longevity , especially among the males . This was combined , however , with a high instance of infant mortality in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , but that was true in all families . Sober farmers everywhere , crossed with the superstable Hudson River Dutch  --  the Van Tuyls and Vanderloos ( livery stables and inns )  --  to say nothing of the sobriety vested in the families of Hannoverand Schleswig-Holstein . Roger wrote to Constance : " They worked from before dawn to after sunset . Hardly a one of them sat down in daylight . No lawyers , few merchants , no bankers ( one  --  your grandfather Ashley ) , no factory workers . They were all what you 're now calling self-employed ' . " Constance wrote back : " Yes , self-employed , self-centered , and self-serving . All so proud of their independence of mind . Independent for small ends . I hate them all . It explains why darling Papa had so little imagination and Mama none . " But there was another side of the coin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines . It was not only the strong-minded uncoercible patriarchs who were drawn to the " freedom " of the new world . The scoundrel , the fanatic , the footloose , the adventurer  --  fiercely independent , every one of them , and of lively imagination  --  that is to say : suspended on the promises of a golden future , they " skipped " to America . The genealogists found disease and insanity . That very bourgade outsideTours from which the Boisgelins and Dubois emigrated to the new world served as subject of a pioneering sociological study , a French counterpart of our " Jukes and Kallikaks . " Moreover ,  |p305it  was discovered that John Ashley 's own grandfather Ashley , who had run away from his Dubois wife , was hanged in the Klondike by an outraged community . Fortunately this morbid material did not reach a wide circle of readers . It was sufficiently troubling that the shadow of the Ashley case hung over John Ashley 's children . Moreover it can not be denied that many observers were of the opinion that the Ashleys were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " immoral . " " They have n't a glimmer of decent Christian ethical behavior . " " They 've made it perfectly clear that they do n't give a snap of their fingers what right-minded self-respecting people think of them . " There was always a certain amount of that . But enough of these matters ! Health and sanity are precarious and must be paid for . Well-being and common sense invent nothing , discover nothing ; they fall back into the humus . As Dr. Gillies said during the first hour of the century ( and did n't believe a word of it ) : " Nature never sleeps or even stands still . Her men are in constant discomfort from growing pains . What they are outgrowing causes them as much suffering as what they are acquiring . " Few of these genealogists and biographers observed  --  or , at least , attempted to describe  --  what we have called the Ashley " abstraction " or " disattachment . " Perhaps it was their enemies who saw it most clearly . In particular there was a chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in a privately printed volume America Through a Telescope by a writer who called himself " Atticus . " This " Atticus " declared himself to be happy to have left America for the shores of the Thames and the Seine . From that safe distance , having taken out British citizenship , he reviewed the horrorsand absurdities of his native land . He attacked the Ashleys with surprising virulence . He appears to have known them well ( especially Constance Ashley-Nishimura ) and enriched his portraitswith many stories not hitherto in circulation . Atticus stressed their propensity to commit social errors . It seems to have particularlyannoyed him that they remained unabashed by thesep306inelegant faux pas . It is true : certain discriminations were missing in the Ashleys . They were unable to disinguish shades of rank , wealth , birth , color , or servitude . In addition , Atticus felt that they were lacking in self-respect . They were slow to anger . They were serene under snub and insult . He was unable to deny their intelligence , but characterized it as lacking " suppleness " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of his chapter . The last come out ; they were indubitably ) Americans.  | " Why did Stacey marry Breck . " Like so many others in Coaltown , Dr. Gillies often asked himself how it was possible that Eustacia Sims so far lost her senses as to marry Breckenridge Lansing . We shall hear later how Dr. Gillies explained it to himself  --  an explanation based on a farfetchednotion and condensed in a phrase that never failed to exasperate his wife , who said that it was in bad grammar : " We keep saying that we live our lives . ' Shucks ! Life lives us . " Breckenridge Lansing was born in Crystal Lake , Iowa . As a boy he planned to enter the Army of the United States and to become a famous general . With his brother Fisher he did a great deal of hunting . Good Baptists can not take life or do anything else enjoyable on Sunday , but they killed and killed on Saturdays and holidays . His marksmanship was so accurate that he aspired to enter West Point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers are required to have a considerable knowledge of mathematics . He repeatedly failed the entrance examinations . During his years at Brockett Baptist College hep310started to prepare himself for the ministry , then for medicine , then for the law . He ended up as an untrained assistant in his father 's drugstore . His father was a loud-laughing man , a leader in clubs and lodges , a good businessman , a hard contemptuous husband and father . Most of these qualifications he inherited from his father and transmitted to his sons . He held offices  --  from banquet managerto vice president  --  in the Middle States Pharmaceutical Association , and took great pleasure in attending the association 's conventions . It was his habit there to sit up late , night after night , playing cards with his fellow officers . In those days every enterprisingdruggist tried to get into the patent medicine ( or " snake oil " ) business . Mr. Lansing despised and feared his older son , Fisher ( " Call me Fish " ) , who had become a lawyer ; he merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the store and in the town . Breckenridge had studied some chemistryin his premedical phase . His father set him to mixing brews in a shed behind the drugstore . He dreamed of a " Lansing Liniment " or of a " Mrs. Lansing 's Wild Honey Elixir . " Young Lansing got no further than establishing a strong alcohol base and writing the promises to be printed on the label . His laboratory became a social center and his experiments frequently occupied him until dawn . One night during a card game in St. Louis a colleague offered the elder Lansing an opportunity to invest money in a new firm manufacturing some products derived from an attar of the West Indian bay tree . This essence , mixed with rum , oil of orange , and other ingredients , had a variety of medicinal and cosmetic uses . It was also reportedly consumed in large quantities by unhappy ladies who had taken the " Pledge . " Lansing sold two pastures and a corner lot ; he invested a considerable amount of money in the enterprise . As always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view . He wanted to make money and he wanted to get young Breckenridge out of Crystal Lake . Taking his son with him hep311went to New York and called at the office of the manufacturing company . He even gave a dinner at Halloran 's Steak and Lobster House . The boy made a favorable first impression . He always did . He was engaged as purchasing agent of raw materials . The oils and the rum came from the Leeward Islands . Breckenridge went to the Caribbean and it was there , on the island of St. Kitts , that he met Eustacia Sims . This young lady came of an English family that had lived in the islands since the early eighteenth century . Generation after generation , the Simses had married into the Creole families of the Antilles . By now there was a very small measure of English blood in his veins , but Eustacia 's father , Alexander Sims , was every inch an Englishman . He not only observed the royal birthdays , but on October 21 he raised the flag at dawn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to half mast to mark the death of Lord Nelson . His womenfolk  --  there were many of them ; both his grandmothers and several great-aunts lived to a hundred  --  had other loyalties . They were indissolubly French , British by citizenship only . They had cousins on every island from Charlotte Amalie to St. Lucia . Guadeloupe was their ancestral Eden . Like every self-respecting Creole they claimed cousinship with Josephine , Empress of France . These ladies sat all day on the verandah of Alexander Sims 's house , fanning themselves , discussing the neighbors , and waiting for the next meal . Marie-Madeleine Dutellier Sims was enormous , voluble , and unhappy . She appeared to be a self-indulgent and mindless woman . She had been reduced to this appearance by idleness , humiliation , and boredom . In large part she was responsible for her own idleness . She was so capable a manager that her family  --  eleven to sixteen heads , including the various dependent relatives  --  were admirably waited upon by five servants ; four others were retained for ostentation . These servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had little need of money . Their meals , clothing , medical care , whippings , and amusement were supplied by their masters . " Madame Seems "  |p312had  left herself nothing to do but to command . Her humiliations she shared with other matrons of the community . Alexander Sims had another family in Basseterre . It lived in a village of thatched roofings , barely protected from the torrential rains and often carriedaway by a high wind . Such a second family was required  --  or at least expected  --  of every upstanding householder . It was so numerous that one could have counted the half-clad boys and girls only if they had improbably stayed motionless for a moment . He often failed to recognize his progeny when he came upon one or other of them on the Prince Albert Wharf or on the Queen VictoriaParade . When their father  --  white , rich , important , quick to anger  --  visited their home they disappeared into the surrounding fronds . Boredom particularly Mrs. Sim 's  --  should not be mistaken for lethargy . Boredom is energy frustrated of outlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little of it was left except her towering rages . Her ancestors , before they settled down to cultivate sugar , had been seamen , adventurers , and buccaneers . She believed that she came of an even more romantic ancestry . These islands had often been landfall and first haven for the slave ships from Africa . Here they put ashore the sick and dying ; here they rid themselves of their troublemakers those whomneither blows nor starvation could subdue . These recalcitrants were generally the strongest of the young men ; even emaciated they would fetch a high price on the mainland . The captains , however , were willing to sell them to the island planters at a loss . The ships had weeks ahead of them . Even in chains these men were dangerous ; they disseminated unrest . One of the most famous of these was Bel-Amade , a prince of the Ashanti , long since entered into ballad and legend . He was auctioned in Guadeloupe in about 1759 . There he bided his time ; he became an exemplary and almost trusted foreman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He delighted in children ; children delighted in him . His master often asked him to sing for his guests  --  the ladies sipping chocolimielfrom cups of Sevres . A ballad tells us that " His back wasp313like the tallest cedar ; his eyes were like the lightning . " The ballad goes on to say that he had a hundred children  --  royal , all of them . Came the Night of St. Joseph , the nineteenth of March , the night of wrath , the night of long sickles . The smoke that arose from thirteen great plantations could be seen from Martinique . So great was the force of Bel-Amade 's mind that even the faithful servants  --  the trusted major domo , the cook , the lady 's maid , the children 's mamee did little to avert the massacre . The Night of St. Joseph ! The night is , of course , remembered with horror . But grandeur in revolt against oppression has a way of capturing our adherence  --  as readers of Milton 's poem know . Slavery enslaves the slaveowner and with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool . Bel-Amade was caught , castrated , and hung from a tree to die in long agony . He became a bogey with whom to threaten children , but the imagination of a people is no stickler for consistency . It was said of any tall straight young man , of any radiant bold young woman  --  in a whisper  --  " Y a la une goutte du sang du beau diable ! " One evening after the ladies on the verandah had been discussing the Night of St. Joseph and its instigator , Eustacia , eight years old , approached her mother . " Maman , est-ce que nous ... est-ce que nous ... ? " " Quoi ? Quoi , nous ? " " Est-ce que nous sommes descendues . . . de Lui ? " " Tais-toi , petite sotte . Nous sommes parentes de l'Imperatrice . C'est assez , je crois . " " Mais , Maman , reponds . " Her mother turned on her daughter a dark and heavily powdered face . Her eyes were proud and stern . She held Eustacia 's gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are ! " Aloud , she said , " Tais-toi , petite idiote !  --  Et mouche-toi ! " Eustacia Sims Lansing and her children had inherited from somewhere their violent tempers , their passion for independence , and  --  with the exception of Anne , who took after her father  --  their interesting coloring.  |p314Alexander  Sims owned and operated a general store on the waterfront in Basseterre . All his daughters were beautiful ; one was intelligent . As soon as she was able , Eustacia left the society on the verandah and became her father 's assistant in the store . She was seventeen . She was soon running the store and running it very well , under difficulty . Her beauty was a constant burden and trial to her . The youths of the island and the sailors of all nations laid unremitting siege ; their every purchase was protracted with hesitations , whispered invitations , and declarations of love . She dressed severely ; she curbed her wit . She neither expressed nor felt scorn ; she merely became remote . She acquired the nickname @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stock collar worn by French officers in the eighteenth century , so stiff and high that the wearer was unable to lower his chin . Her capability first astonished , then delighted her father . It enabled him to fulfill an ambition ; he obtained a post in the customs house where he could wear a uniform all day . He could serve his sovereign . Twice a day Eustacia 's eyes lost their unloving glaze ; once  --  where there were few to see  --  at the earliest mass , and once  --  late at night , in treasured solitude  --  when she unlocked the snowy wonder of her trousseau . She knew her vocation . She knew why she had been born into the world . It was to love ; to be a wife and mother . She had seen no examples of the kind of marriage to which she aspired . She invented marriage . She raised an edifice . A bird hatched from an egg in a dark room can build a nest without having seen one . She assembled fragments from the admonitions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roses that circulated on the island , from the very marriages she saw about her  --  tired , spiritless , insulted , at best resigned  --  from altar paintings . It is given to some to " idealize " continuously and strongly , as a Bornbyxmori secretes silk . Eustacia Sims intended to give and receive all the plenitude of the earth by love ; to grow seven feet tall by love ; to have ten children  --  Chevalier Bayards , Josephines  --  by love ; to merit her beauty by love ; to live to a hundred , bowed down beneath the crowns of love . She would remain simple and humble  --  yes , leaving her two score children and grandchildren outside the church , she would kneel in the side chapel  --  as she did now  --  only asking acceptance of a woman 's life in love . She had arrived at the age of nineteen without having glimpsed a man , young or old , who could be imagined as sharing this life with her . Eustacia was as healthy in mind as in body . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marriageable young men in the region ( they were all , more or less , her cousins ) ; she knew the landscape of their minds , the good and the bad . It was certain that her husband would not come from these islands . Her interest quickened when she heard foreign languages spoken . She doubted that there were more beautiful lands in the world than her own , but she could easily believe that there were countriesless steeped in vanity , malice , sloth , and contempt for women . She cast searching glances at the German , Italian , Russian , and Scandinavian officers who visited the port ; but held herself aloof from their overtures . Her husband would not be a seaman absent on long voyages from the home they would build together . She waited . Her mother , from her vast rattan chair , watched Eustacia 's progress and understood her problem . She worried about her own : she had three older daughters to marry off , but the island 's marriageable young men had eyes only for her youngest . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island , and by the priests  --  " Chere madame . . . Jean-Baptiste 's Antoine is an exellent young man . . . will inherit . . . good habits . . . very much in love with your daughter Eustacia . Could you speak to your daughter , Madame Marie-Madeleine ? " One evening she called Eustacia into her bedroom . " Now , my daughter , for two years you 've been refusing every offer that comes to us . You refuse to marry and you stand in the way of your sisters ' getting married . What is it you want ? " " Maman , are you angry with me for working in the store ? "  |p316No  . " Why are you angry with me ? Is it my fault that Antoine and Meme and le petit a Beaurepaire want to marry me ? They are nice boys . I like them . I do not love them . Maman , they waste my time when I have work to do . " " So !  --  Now listen to me , Eustachie . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a journey , by public coach , or on one of those railway trains , she is often annoyed . She is pushed and pinched and followed by young men and old men who have no fear of God . What do those modest girls do ? They brush their foreheads and their cheeks with le vert de houx . It does not hurt the skin . You can wash it off in a moment . It merely removes the glow of youth . It gives a gray pallor  --  even a faintly green tinge  --  to the skin . The shameless men leave the dear girls alone ! " What do you think of that , ma fine ? " " Maman , angel . Maman , have you some of this vert de houx ? " " Here on the island we have no holly , but we have something else . We have the root called borqui , or some call it boraqui . Look ! " " Quick ! Quick ! Maman ! Quick , let me try it . " People began to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beginning to look old . She would be an old maid . Her sisters were serenaded . Marjolaine was engaged to be married by Christmas . Breckenridge Lansing had not been three days on the island of St. Kitts when suddenly Eustacia Sims regained all her lost beauty between a Tuesday and a Wednesday . Breckenridge Lansing was good at the start of everything he started . He went from island to island organizing the delivery of bay oil and rum . Everywhere he met with success . For him barrels and carboys and kegs rolled from plantation warehouses and were stamped with the address of his company 's laboratories in Jelinek , New Jersey . Entertainments were improvised for him . There werep317dances by candlelight in the courtyards of great estates . He was taken hunting . Mothers bedecked their daughters for him . Men soon tired of his company . He had a number of the likable traits of a boy , but these men were not accustomed to the conversation of boys . Among the women he won all hearts , including that of Eustacia Sims . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tormentedly : how ? why ? One morning in early December , years before Lansing 's visit , the citizens of Basseterre lifted their eyes to behold a great fourmastedschooner gliding into the port . On each yard a dozen youths were standing , dressed in white , their arms outspread . This was a strange apparition , but what followed was no less spectacular . The training ship Gdynia of the Polish navy was making a tour of the world . It carried two hundred midshipmen between the ages of thirteen and sixteen . A people with dark hair and dark eyes , like these islanders , assume that their coloring  --  together with all the characteristics that accompany it  --  is human nature itself , is Man . It has no secrets from them . They have resigned themselves to it perfidious , self-advertising , backsliding . But lo ! the two hundred midshipmen and their officers came ashore bringing with them the wonder of another Man  --  the vulnerable candor of blue eyes , the promise of innocence invested in honeycoloredhair . When Gregory the Great first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he exclaimed , " Not Angles but Angels . " The fourmaster Gdynia continued its journey around the world , but another Gdynia floated , white sails furling , through the imaginations of the island women , a ship manned by incorruptibleknights of rose and gold , with cerulean eyes . Dr. Gillies , who worried ideas as a dog worries old bones , used to say : " Nature 's trying to get rid of extremes . There was too much dispersion in the last million million years . I see in the paper how there are n't so many blondes left in France ; they have to go to Sweden and England to fill those girly-girly shows . We 'll allp318be brown-haired soon . The churches in Russia are hard put to it to find more basses that can make the chandeliers rock , and in Berlinthere 's an awful dearth of tenors . We 'll all be baritones from now on . Nobody 'll be tall or short or dark or light . Nature ca n't stand extremes . She 's throwing opposites into each other 's arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the golden age comes  --  the lion will lie down with the lamb . I see it coming . " " Charles , stop it ! " " The violent man will be attracted by the gentle and prudent girl . The owl will lie down with the petrel . Ineffective somnolent wisdom will couple with stormy vitality . Eggs , eggs , interesting eggs . Look at you and me , Cora ! " " Oh , go along with you . " " Darwin 's never tired of showing us how nature selected types for adaptation and survival . " " I wo n't have that man mentioned in my house , Charles ! " " Well , maybe NATURE after hundreds of millions of years has begun selecting for intelligence and mind and spirit . Maybe NATURE is moving into a new era . Breed out the stupid ; breed in the wise . Maybe that 's why Stacey married Breck . NATURE commandedit . She wanted some interesting babies for her new idea .  --  We keep on saying that we ' live our lives . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grammar . " Breckenridge Lansing had the commonplace face of an Iowadruggist 's assistant , but his eyes were of a light cornflower blueand hair was of a silver gold . To the business men of the Antilleshe represented fair dealing ; to Eustacia Sims he gave promise ofchildren like those that hover among the clouds in altar paintings . The office in New York was pleased with Lansing 's work . He returned to the States , teeming with projects and ideas . Headroitly blocked any suggestion that he return to the Caribbean . He knew already that he was one who could not repeat a success.  |p319He  was sent to the laboratories in New Jersey . He leaned over the steaming vats , half closed his eyes and murmured " hmm , " judi. ciously . He picked up a smattering of ideas concerning the processesfrom the men about him . He submitted some notions for improvement , but his first reception had begun to wear thin . There are certain by-products of coal tar that are put to similar uses through similar processes . The company sent him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined patents . The Pittsburgh company was struck with admiration for his intelligence and energy ( " Best young man we 've seen in a long time , " ... " bright as a penny " ) and offered him a position . He accepted promptly . He liked change . There were good cardplayingfellows ' everywhere ; there were animals to be shot everywhere ; the kind of women he liked liked him and they could be found everywhere . Before he moved to Pittsburgh , he returned to Basseterre and married Eustacia Sims . The charming young couple spent only a year in Pittsburgh . Lansing was sent , with many a congratulatoryhandshake , to the " Poor John " mines in Coaltown , Illinois . Eustacia Sims on the island spent some agonizing hours in her church . She was marrying outside her faith . But several events in the town during those last months seemed to confirm her resolve . They extended her knowledge of what could be expected by women married to a dark-haired , dark-eyed male . She sold the larger part of her trousseau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and withdrew what she thought was due her . Lansing never knew that she had over a thousand dollars concealed in the back of her grandmother 's mirror and in the seams of her clothing . Some doubt might be entertained as to whether Eustacia Sims was ever married , truly married . She bound herself by vows in three ceremonies  --  onein the Queen 's registry office , one in a Baptist church , and one in a church of her own faith . They were all crowded into three days , because Lansing must return to his position in Pittsburgh . The only ceremony that meant anything to herp320was performed in a little church on the farther side of the island . She was married by an uncle who loved her dearly . He stretched the rite as far as it could go . ( Lansing had given his promise that he would receive " instruction " at the earliest possible moment . ) Eustacia did not notice  --  or , perhaps , did not choose to notice  --  certain lacunae in the ceremony . She certainly heard a nuptial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger . He had bought it in New York , but unfortunately on the eve of leaving that harbor he had lost forty dollars in a card game among strangers . Eustacia  --  bright-eyed saleswoman that she was  --  knew at once that the ring was of plated brass . She dipped into her own savings and replaced it with one of purest gold . They were very popular on the ship that carried them to New York  --  he for his wit , she for her beauty . ( Her wit was as remarkableas her beauty , but she lost it within three days ; it returned like a famished dog , eight years later . ) On the seventh and last night the captain raised his glass to the most attractive couple he had ever had the privilege of conveying . The passengers rose from their chairs and shouted . Eustacia had the sensation of climbing mountain after mountain of despair . She could perhaps become accustomed to the discovery that he was obsequious to wealth and office  --  a trait she had fled from in her father ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from in her mother ; that he was stingy in small things and spendthrift in large . Perhaps the thing that most affronted her was the constant play in his fancy with assassination . On the deck , in the dining saloon he aimed imaginary guns at his fellow passengers : " Click ! Got ' em where the camel got the needle ! " " Got to raise my sights . There ! Sorry , madam ! Goodnight ! " " Wait till the old giraffe comes round again . " " But , Breckenridge , let them live . " " All right , Stacey , if you say so , honey . Just one more for the sharks . " He was silent only in sleep . It is the privilege of a bride/groom to introduce a sheltered girl to a store of witty anecdotes that has hitherto been closed to her . There is a small proportion of jokes about sexual relations that does not conceal  --  like a bludgeon in a bouquet  --  an aggressive contempt for woman . BreckenridgeLansing may have heard some of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The attractive young couple disembarked in New York on St. Valentine 's Day , 1878 . Eustacia had never seen snow ; she had never felt the cold . As soon as she was able she stumbled through the snowdrifts to a church of her faith . Toward the end of the hour on her knees she assumed the yoke as punishment for her disobedience . She had made a mistake , but she trusted that the sacramentof marriage would , in some unforseeable way , support her . They went on to Pittsburgh and from Pittsburgh to Coaltown . Neither place could boast a salubrious climate  --  least of all for a daughter of sun and sea . They lost three children . XTe have seen how Lansing readily let the reins of administration pass first to Miss Thorns , then to Ashley . But every man must establishsome area in his life where he is a success . He was a success in clubs and lodges ; he was a great success in those taverns up the River Road where his laughter , stories , and horseplay reanimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week he drove his team home as the sun rose . Staggering , he released his horses to the croquet lawn . It was not necessary for him to climb any stairs ; he could slip into bed in an abandoned playroom on the first floor . He released his horses to the croquet lawn  --  an all but unimaginable example of bad husbandry  --  not because he was drunk , but because he was tired . He was exhausted with that multiplication of fatigue that follows exertions spent  --  above a ground bass of self-doubt and despair  --  in search of pleasure . Eustacia early learned that she had been spared one burden  --  her husband was not a drinking man . Alcohol disagreed with him . To Breckenridge Lansing this was a deep mortification , for heavy drinking played a large part in the image he had received in child/hood of what is required of a man . Nevertheless , he drank and talked in large terms about his drinking . He had learned all the devices of concealment . He emptied his glass in flower pots and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the table . He even carried a goose feather with which , apart , he could empty his stomach . Lansing was proud of his wife  --  more than that , he had fallen obscurely in love with her ; but he was afraid of her . She managed the house and his income in exemplary fashion . She dispensed with a " hired girl " and employed an occasional cleaning woman . This was much to her husband 's indignation ; a **25;8339;TOOLONG provided his wife with " help . " Eustacia 's reason was that she did not wish the often stormy scenes at " St. Kitts " to be reported to Coaltown . She invested his money ; she advised him in many matters ; she wrote his speeches for lodge meetings and for Fourth of July celebrations . He was the foremostman in town . It was hard enough for him that Eustacia was always right ; it was harder that she never alluded to her endowments ; she never crowed . He loved her , but he shrank from seeing himself reflected in her eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him except the failings of her father . There are few things so conducive to despair as seeing the recurrence of weaknesses in those close to you ; it enables you to read the future . Her father had been indolent . She begged Breckenridge to return to the New York office ; she offered him the store in Basseterre . She never descended to vituperation . The violent quarrels did not begin until she saw the way in which Breckenridge chose to bring up their son George . The John Ashleys arrived in Coaltown in 1885 . They bought the house that was thought to be haunted by the long tragedy of the Airlee MacGregors . The Lansings lived rent free , in the house assigned to the managing director of the mines . It was of blackened red brick , withoutverandahs , and stood among mournful yews and cedars . Behindp323it a wide lawn , edged with great butternut trees , led down to the pond . Until Lansing christened it " St. Kitts , " it was known in town after the name of his predecessor as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and childlike themselves , lived in the happy tumult of their eleven children  --  six of their own and five nephews and nieces they had adopted The rugs were in tatters , the chairs unsteady ; some of the windows were sealed with brown paper for there was indoor catchball on rainy days . There was no dining room at all . Since they ate in the kitchen , the dining table was in the way of perpetual games and had been moved outdoorsunder the grape arbor . The clocks had broken down . The railings on the front and back porches were left unmended . Why mend them when there are always at least three children between nine and twelve ? Little Nicholas and little Philippina were dressed in clothes that had been successively worn by at least three brothers or sisters or cousins . Happy Debevoises , where are you now ? From the first , Lansing admired John Ashley and imitated him , stumblingly . He went so far as to pretend that he , too , was a happily married man . Society would have got nowhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the names of snobberyand hypocrisy . Ashley converted his Rainy Day House into a laboratory for experiment and invention . Lansing built a Rainy Day House behind " St. Kitts " and revived his interest in " snake oils . " Perhaps it was the influence of the Debevoises , perhaps the example of the Ashleys , that enabled Eustacia to bear a child that lived , then another , then a third . The Lansings were older than the Ashleys , but their children were closely of an age : Felicite Marjolaine Dupuy Lansing ( she was born on St. Felix 's Day ; the Iowa Lansing names had been carried to Heaven by the dead infants ) and Lily Scolastica Ashley ; George Sims Lansing and Roger Berwyn Ashley ; then Sophia alone ; then Anne Lansing and Constance Ashley . Eustacia Lansing carried well her torch of hypocrisy or whatever it was . In public  --  at the Mayor 's picnic , on the front bench at the Memorial Day exercises  --  she played the proud and devoted wife.  |p324Creole  beauty is short-lived . By the time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a less delicatehue ; her features had lost much of their doelike softness ; she was decidedly plump . Nevertheless , everyone in Coaltown , from Dr. Gillies to the boy who shined shoes at the Tavern , knew that the town could boast two handsome and unusual women . Mrs. Ashley was tall and fair ; Mrs. Lansing was short and dark . Mrs. Ashley-child of the ear as a German  --  had no talent for dress , but a magical speaking voice , and she moved like a queen ; Mrs. Lansing  --  child of the eye as a Latin  --  was mistress of color and design , though her voice cut like a parrot 's and her gait lacked grace . Mrs. Ashley was serene and slow to speak ; Mrs. Lansing was abrupt and voluble . Mrs. Ashley had little humor and less wit ; Mrs. Lansing ransacked two languages and a dialect for brilliant and pungent mots and was a devastating mimic . For almost twenty years these ladies were in and out of one another 's house , as were their children . They got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ashley lacked the imagination or freedom of attention to penetrate the older woman 's misery . ( John Ashley was well aware of it , but did not speak . ) One art they shared in common : both were incomparablecooks ; one condition : both were far removed from the environment that had shaped their early lives . For these two families the first ten years went by without remarkableevent : pregnancies , diapers , and croup ; measles and fallingout of trees ; birthday parties , dolls , stamp collections , and whooping cough . George was caught stealing Roger 's three-sen stamp ; Roger had his mouth washed out with soap and water for saying " hell . " Felicite , who aspired to be a nun , was discovered sleeping on the floor in emulation of some saint ; Constance refused to speak to her best friend Anne for a week . You know all that . In Coaltown the principal meal , weekdays , was at noon . Supper was at six and consisted of " leftovers . " No one invited friends in to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , invited their minister and his family to Sunday dinner . Relatives from outp325of town were scarcely considered to be guests ; the women helped cook the dinner and wash the dishes . Beata Ashley astonished the town by inviting friends to a late meal by candlelight from which the children were absent . The Lansings were always present , occasionallyDr . Gillies and his wife , or a retired judge who had known city life , and some others . Mrs. Lansing returned the invitations . Twice a year members of the mine 's Pittsburgh directorate descended on the town on a tour of inspection . They put up at the Illinois Tavern , but were invited to " St. Kitts " and " The Elms " for dinner . They received the surprise of their lives  --  a surprise which did not abate on repeated visits : Beata Ashley 's tranquil distinction ; Eustacia'swit and beauty , together with the flamboyance of her clothes and that grain de beauty which nature had planted with the most calculated art on her right cheekbone ; the variety of subjects discussedand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their wives had to pay for it : " Is n't there anything else in the world to eat exceptroast beef and stewed chicken ? " " Do you have to talk about the servants all the time ? " ) At these dinners John Ashley spoke little , yet all eyes were constantly turned toward him . It was for him that the men were judicious , but easy ; the women charming , and Lansing discreet . The visitors expressed to him their gratification at the improvement in the mine 's returns . Casually , all but unobtrusively , he directed the commendation to Breckenridge Lansing . One thing of remark happened during those first ten years . Eustacia Lansing fell consumedly in love with John Ashley . As we know , John Ashley saved no money . He had married an accomplished housekeeper and had bought an orchard , kitchen garden , and henhouse . From time to time he suppressed in himself the concern as to how he would provide a better education for his children . He had a vague notion that he would be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was evolving in the Rainy Day House . He had become engrossed in locks . He bought up old safes collected from the ashes of buildings that had burned to the ground . He studied timepieces and firearms . Lansing , imi/tating him sedulously in his Rainy Day House , dropped his interestsin lotions and cosmetics and tried his hand at mechanics . Ashley encouraged him warmly in these interests . The younger man followed with great concern Lansing 's dissipation on the River Road , his sloth , and his neglect of Eustacia . They launched out on projects together ; Ashley kept up the pretense that Lansing was an invaluable co-worker . Lansing brought to these projects his vision of their success , of the enormous amounts of money they would bring . But year after year Ashley delayed forwarding his designs to the Patent Office ; to himself , he seemed always on the point of improving them . To maintain Lansing 's enthusiasm he wrote their combined names , beautifully , on the various folders that contained the mechanical drawings . But tinkering with coils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distract BreckenridgeLansing long from the fields where he was second to none . Breckenridge Lansing 's father treated his wife and children with contempt ; his son tried to . This view was not universal in those States , but frequent . At the end of the last century the patriarchalage was drawing to a close ; its majesty was cracking . We may assume that when a patriarchal order is at its height  --  or a matriarchalorder , also  --  it has a certain grandeur . It contributes to the even running of society and to harmony in the home . Everyone knows his place . The head of the family is always right . Fatherhood invests him with a more than personal wisdom . His position resemblesthat of the king who throughout thousands of years of unquestionedand even divine sanction , receives in the cradle the capacities that make for leadership . The doctrine was so deeply instilledthat the people regarded the errors , vices , and imbecilities of kings as expressions of God 's will : bad kings were sent for the punishment , instruction , and edification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is when the patriarchal order is undergoing transition the pendulum swings in eternal oscillation between the male and female poles  --  that havoc descends upon the state and on the family . Fathers feel the pavement crack/ing beneath them . For a time they shout , argue , boast , and pour scorn upon the wife of their bosom and the pledges of their love . Abraham did not raise his voice . Women armored themselves as best they could during the transition . Guile is the shield and spear of the oppressed . Slaves can not revolt without leaders , but slavery is a poor school for leadership . Breckenridge Lansing 's mother was an example of a woman in an age of crumbling patriarchy . Her sons knew no other patterns than a bullying father and a cowed mother . Eustacia Lansing had been brought up in a matriarchy . She was unable to comprehend the tacit assumptions that shaped family life in Coaltown . She was saved by her gift of humor . A crumbling patriarchy is tragic and very funny . It is the growing sons who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best of homes , at the best of times , a boy is always in the wrong . Boys are filled with exhausting energies ; they enjoy noise ; they are ( or where would we be ? ) adventurous and inquiring . They creep out onto ledges and fall into caves and two hundred men spend nights searching for them . They must hurl objects . They particularly cherish small animals and must have them near . A respect for cleanliness is as slowly and painfully acquired as mastery of the violin . They are perpetually famished and can barely be taught to eat decorously ( the fork was late appearing in society ) . They are unable to sit still for more than ten minutes unless they are being told a story about mayhem and sudden death ( or where would we be ? ) . They receive several hundred rebukes a day . They rage at the humiliation of being male and not men . They strain to hasten the calendar . They must smoke and swear . Dark warnings are thrown out to them about " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be reserved to adults . They peer into mirrors for the first promise of a beard . No wonder they are happy only among their coevals ; they return from their unendinggames ( that resemble warfare ) puffed up , it may be , with triumph  --  late , dirty , or bloody . Few records have reached us of the early years of Richard the Lion-Hearted ; the story about Georgep328Washington and the cherry tree is not widely believed . Achilles and Jason were brought up by a tutor who was half-man , half-horse . Their education was all in the open air ; there must have been a good deal of running involved and very little mystery surrounding the natural functions . Breckenridge Lansing brought up his son according to a method widely advocated at the time . Its purpose was to " make a man " of him . It consisted of ridiculing the child in public and private on every occasion of his falling short in manly exercise . At five he was thrown into the water and commanded to swim . At six he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best father in the world , " but all fathers are wonderful ) on the lawn behind the house . Coordination of hand and eye is not fully developed at six and is further troubled by the boy 's passionate and despairing attempts to be adequate . The genial games ended in tears . At seven he was given a pony ; when he had fallen off it for the third time his father sold it . At nine he was introduced to the rifle . At each new trial he was overwhelmed with sneers and his failures were recounted to neighbors and postmen and delivery boys . Eustacia attempted to intervene only to be covered with similar sarcasms . Little Anne endeared herself to her father by shrieking " Sissy ! Sissy ! " Woeful scenes took place . Felicite paled but did not speak . When George was elected vice-captain of his school 's baseball team only vice-captain ; Roger Ashley was everywhere captain his father refused to speak to him for three days . Nature came to George 's aid too late . At sixteen he was as tall as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murderous rages . The day came when he advanced on his tormentor , holding a chair which he slowly broke in mid-air . From that hour his father loudly washed his hands of him . George was the product of his mother 's mollycoddling . He would never be a Lansing . His father was right . George was a Sims and a Dutellier and a Creusot . He had his mother 's dark complexion . His schoolmates called him " Nig " until he thrashed it out of them . Miss Dobrey ,  |p329of  the high school , said that he had the " face of an angry lynx . " He collected about him a gang of his friends and called them the " Mohicans . " They became the terror of the town . They altered the signposts on the roads . They set the church bells jangling . They even climbed Herkomer 's Knob and tried to spy on the Sundayeveningservices at the Church of the Covenant . They took large allowance of the license accorded at Halloween . Chief Constable Leyendecker called several times at " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was sent away , briefly , to several military academies and preparatory schools . Anne was her father 's favorite and walked the earth with the assurance that such predilection confers . Life presented few obstacleswhich obstinacy , clamor , and rudeness could not remove . She was all Lansing  --  an angel of cerulean blue eye , of cornsilk hair , of inborn certitudes . She was a little lady at ten and a formidable matron at thirteen . Her best friend was Constance Ashley  --  Constance , who came from a home where no voices were ever raised and no claims for privileged attention ever advanced . Children arrive at amnesties that diplomats might envy . Constance made clear the limits beyond which she would not be browbeaten , but the friendship was often in jeopardy . Felicite 's mother on the island of St. Kitts had enjoyed two half-hours of happiness daily : at dawn before the altar , at midnightabove her snowy trousseau . Felicite 's dream was to combine them  --  she hoped to enter the religious life . She attended the conventschool at Fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her home . She renounced the joy she felt in the life at St. Joseph 's and entered the high school in Coaltown . She resembled her mother in appearance , though taller ; she had none of her mother 's vivacity . She was an exemplary student and would have excelled in schoolwork many times more difficult . At the age when many girls keep diaries and guard them under lock and key , she wrote her diary in Latin . She was an accomplished needlewoman and dressed herself with a taste and distinction that astonished evenp330her mother . It was understood in the family that no one entered Felicite 's room , though the door stood open all day . She would have wished it to be white , but white rooms were labor lost in Coaltown . It was blue , with touches of deep red and purple ; it was at once simple and rich . Her skill in embroidery was everywhere present , in curtains , counterpanes , table runners , and antimacassars . She had been enthralled by Miss Doubkov 's icons and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set on backgrounds of velvet and surrounded with gold lace and colored beads  --  glowed from the walls . The silks on her prie-dieu changed with the feasts and the seasons . The room was neither a cell nor a chapel  --  it was a place of waiting and of preparation for great happiness . From time to time in the day 's work , when Felicite was absent , her mother would lean against the door frame gazing into the room . " The children we bring into the world ! " Like her sister , Felicite had been a stormy child . She had won her contained disposition by daily struggle , year after year , winningat the same time a measure of detachment from the " world . " She was moving toward abstraction . She loved her mother . She loved her brother passionately . But these loves were already imbued with the love of the creature which was enjoined upon her . Through these same disciplines she had found her way to a love for her father and younger sister . She had no friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stormy scenes at " St. Kitts " she never left the room -- not when Anne lay rolling and screaming on the hearthrug ( " I will not go to bed ! " " I will not wear the blue dress ! " ) ; not when her father hurled one wounding phrase after another at his wife and son . She seldom spoke ; she moved nearer to her mother and brother and listened to her father with unshaken gaze . A man 's severest judges are his children and he knows it  --  severest of all when they are silent . She stood by her mother , but there was a barrier between them . They sewed together ; they read together the classics of French literature ; they partook of the sacramentside by side . They were mother and daughter in deep admira/tion and fellow suffering , but there was no laughter . Eustacia was born with an apprehension of the comical incongruities in life and , for all her trials , found amusement everywhere . It was an element in her nature that she could not share with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  every inflection of his mother 's wit , rare though the flashes were . ) Year after year , before and after her father 's death , Felicite postponed her great decision in order to be of use in the family at " St. Kitts . " Mother and daughter had more in common , however , than they were fully aware of . Both were journeying ; both were waiting ; both were straining to understand . They were present at a woeful drama , but they never doubted their prayers and patience and love would yield some enlightenment  --  for all . We came into the world to learn . They had lived among wonders all their lives . ( Had n't they , for example , mastered their ugly senseless tempers ? ) They never doubted that some miracle would arrive . Fortunately , George had two friends : John Ashley and Olga Doubkov . Ashley " covered " Lansing 's incompetence at the mine by gradually assuming most of the functions of his superior and endeavored to furnish him wholesome occupation by associating him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices were variously interpreted ; it was charged that he was bent on usurping Lansing 's position , and that in the experiments he made a systematic theft of Lansing 's brilliant ideas . ) There was little Ashley could do , however , to correct Lansing 's method of " making a man " out of George . He did what he could . He managed to extract from the boy a succession of plans for his lifework  --  at twelve he wanted to invent flying machines ; at thirteen he wanted to go to Africa to save the lions from extermination ; at fourteen he wanted to join a circus . It was early in George 's fifteenthyear that an occasion presented itself that greatly advanced the friendship . The Lansing children were subject to illness and accident . In the early fall of 1900 George suffered a succession of colds andp332sore throats . It was decided that his tonsils should be trimmed or removed . Lansing directed his wife to take the boy to Dr. Hunter in Fort Barry and pass the nights before and after the operation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , though Felicite spent the nights at the convent school . John Ashley seldom left Coaltown , but on that Friday  --  as it happened  --  he had business in Fort Barry . The negotiation dragged on and required his remaining there overnight . He went to the railroad station and asked Jerry Bilham , the conductor , to tell Coaltown 's stationmaster to inform Mrs. Ashley that he would not be home until the morrow . The Farmer 's Hotel was full , but the great Mr. Corrigan arranged that a cot be set up for him in the pantry . Ashley did not see Mrs. Lansing or her son during the day , but he came upon Anne on the hotel porch and listened to a long self-important explanation of her presence in Fort Barry . Ashley had failed to bring sufficient pocket money to buy his dinner at the hotel ; he went to a lunchroom and ordered a bowl of soup . By ten o'clock all were sleeping soundly except Eustacia Lansing and her son . George was tossing and babbling in his sleep . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " George ! George , dear ! It 's nothing . Hundreds of people have their tonsils taken out every month . You 'll have forgotten all about it in a week . You wo n't have sore throats any more . " " Is it almost morning ? What time is it , Mama ? " She told herself it was the break in routine that was unsettling . George had not slept away from his own bed more than eight times in his life  --  he had been Roger 's guest at " The Elms " ; there had been some hunting trips with his father . She had not slept ten times away from " St. Kitts " since her arrival there . She talked of the ice cream the doctor had prescribed for him , of the improvement in his condition for athletics . They had this secret . She would tell him about the most beautifulisland in the world , about the blue sky and water , about how she ran a store when she was only a few years older than he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the verandah , about her father in his beautiful white uniform , about the young men on the island who were always singing and serenading . She talked of these things with no one else . It was understood that she would someday take him there ; he would take her there , in fact . George was devout . He wanted to go to the church ; he wanted to kneel at the very spot where she had knelt . From time to time she spoke of his father 's visit to St. Kitts , but George made no comment . He never mentioned his father . She sang a song in her patois and George fell asleep . She moved over to a large wicker chair by the window and looked down at the town square . All was dark . " Dark as my life , " she thought , but caught herself short . " No ! No ! My life is hard but not dark . Something 's coming . Something'sunfolding . My mistake is going to be redeemed . " How could she wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would remove  --  would annihilate  --  her children ? " We are our lives . Everything is bound together . No smallest action can be thought other than it is . " She groped among the concepts of necessityand free will . Everything is mysterious , but how unendurable life would be without the mystery . She slipped to her knees and buried her face in her arms on the seat of the chair . The moon rose . Toward midnight George gave a loud cry and sprang up in his bed like a leaping fish . " No ! No ! " " Sh , George , Mama 's here . " " Where am I ? " " We 're at Fort Barry . Everything 's all right , dear . " George began to sob . He shook his head from side to side ; he struck it against the bedstead . Anne awoke and chanted , " Crybaby ! Sissy ! " He refused a glass of water . He struck his mother 's hand from his forehead . Half an hour later he was still weeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fro , distraught . She thought of sending for Father Dillon . Suddenly she becamep334aware of the sound of voices in the corridor  --  some guests were returning to their rooms , shepherded by the great Mr. Corrigan himself . " Keep your voices down , gentlemen . There are a lot of people sleeping in the house . . . Joe ! Joe ! . . . Herb ! . . . That 's not your room . Come along , here . . . Lift your feet , Joe  --  that 's right ! " Eustacia Lansing dressed and woke Anne . She told her to dress and go downstairs . " Tell Mr. Corrigan that your brother has an attack of nerves . Tell him to wake Mr. Ashley and ask Mr. Ashleyto come here to talk to your brother . " Anne enjoyed her mission and performed it ably . Ashley came to their room . " It 's nightmares , John . I ca n't do anything with him . Dr. Hunt 's taking out his tonsils tomorrow .  --  Anne , be quiet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's bed , hissing , " Sissy ! Sissy ! " Ashley crossed the room and sat down beside her . He asked confidentially : " Why do you say that , Anne ? " " Boys do n't cry . " " I know . That 's what Coaltown thinks . " " Everybody knows that . " " Coaltown 's a very small place , Anne . There are millions of people who never heard of Coaltown . There are an awful lot of things that Coaltown does n't know . I would n't like to think that you and Constance are just little Coaltown girls that do n't know very much  --  just little country girls that only think what Coaltown thinks . " " What do you mean , Mr. Ashley ? " " Did n't you ever hear that the biggest and strongest men cry sometimes ? " " No . . . Papa never cries . Papa says  --  " " Abraham Lincoln cried . And King David cried . You know that . And we were just reading aloud the other night about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Achilles . The book said that great tears fell on his hands . Your brother 's going to be a very strong man and sometimes he 's going to cry . " Anne was silent . George held his breath . Ashley took the chair by George and gestured to his mother , directing her to move away as far as possible . He spoke in a low voice . " I know about bad dreams , George . I know all about them .  --  You do n't like having your tonsils out tomorrow ? " " No . I do n't care about that . It . . . is n't that . " " Everybody laughs at dreams , but they can be very bad . And very real . I used to have them after I got this scar on my jaw . Can you see it ? I got that from a pitchfork when I was haying . I was just about your age .  --  Can you remember your dream ? " " Not . . . all of it . " " Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Who ? " " It was like a giant . He had a round knife like they cut high grass with . " " A sickle or a scythe ? " " It was like a sickle . " " Do you know who it was chasing you ? " " No , it was like a giant . He was laughing like it was a game , but ... " " You got away all right . " " I do n't want to go to sleep again . I turned around and I did something at him . And he . . . burst . It was awful , Mr. Ashley . It was all squashy under my feet , like maybe I killed him or something . I only wanted to stop him . " Here George turned his head to the wall and lay trembling . " I see . I see . Yes , it 's a bad dream you had . No wonder you 're shaken up . But in a way it 's a good dream , too . A man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George . " " Will he be there again , if I go to sleep ? "  | " Come to the window and look out . Look , the moon 's just come up . See the Soldiers ' Monument ? See him there with his chin up ? Men had to fight . They did n't want to fight and they did n't want to kill . Do you know any men who fought in the Civil War ? " " Yes , I know lots , Mr. Ashley : Mr. Killigrew at the depot and Dan May 's grandfather , and , I think , Mr. Corcoran . " " Yes , he was a drummer boy . Think of what they went through , George ; and yet see how quiet it is down there . Listen ! ... Take some deep breaths of that air before you get back in bed . It 's better than the air in Coaltown , I can tell you that !  --  One of the reasons you had a bad dream is because your throat 's clogged up . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get rid of that tomorrow .  --  George , why do n't you ever work on a farm , summers , like my boy does ? You 're strong already , but that kind of work makes a man really strong . You know it 's hard  --  hoeing and hayingall day and milking and carrying middlings to the pigs . Now you 'd better get back into bed . " " Papa does n't want me to . He says we 're rich enough so I do n't have to work . " " Your father 's just joking . Money has nothing to do with it . I 'm your father 's best friend . I can make him see it 's a good thing . Mr. Bell says that in the summer he can use every hand he can get . You 're no scamooter , George . It 'd be a lucky farmer that 'd hire you . " Thanks , Mr. Ashley . " " Does the sun go round the earth , George , or does the earth go round the sun ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And anything else ? " " The moon , and ... the planets , I think . " " And what 's the sun doing all that time ? " " It 's going very fast . " " And carrying us with it ? " " Yes . "  | " It 's as though we were on a great ship moving through the skies . " Pause . " I often have that feeling just before I fall off to sleep . We 're going at that great speed and yet you saw how quiet it is down there in the square . It 's a wonderful fact , is n't it ? " " Yes , sir . " " Wonderful fact ! " Ashley walked to the window and looked out ; then he returned to the chair beside the bed . " What do you want to be when you grow up , George ? " George was silent . " Do you still want to go to Africa and save the lions ? " " No . I ... " " Have you an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put down your ear , Mr. Ashley . I do n't want anybody to hear it .  --  Did you ever see a show in a theayter , Mr. Ashley ? " " Yes . Yes , I have . I 've seen Edwin Booth play Hamlet . " " Did you ? ... Mama , Felicite , and I read Hamlet together . " " Did you ? " " Edwin Booth 's brother killed President Lincoln , did n't he ? " " A high-strung family , I guess , George . Nervous . " " At one of the schools I went to they took us to see Uncle Tom 's Cabin . . . . I want to be one of them , Mr. Ashley . " When we are talking soberly to the young we are moving in evanescent landscapes , in corridors of dreams , abysses on either side . Ashley could not know who this was he was talking to  --  who it was in the fullest of time . " If you have the talent , George , and the will , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you about Edwin Booth someday . But if that 's what you want to be , you 'd better have those tonsils cleared up as soon as possible . There are no giants in the Farmer 's Hotel tonight , George . Shake hands . Now tell your mother you 're going to sleep so that she can get some rest , too . " Eustacia followed him to the door . She could barely find the breath to utter a word of thanks . She sat for an hour by the window ,  |p338very  conscious of the ship that was carrying her and her family . She rested her cheek on her hand , a faint unprompted smile upon her face . During that hour she ridded herself  --  she threw overboard  --  the last remnants of an unhappiness that had long tormented her  --  she ceased to envy Beata Ashley her marriage . Almost twenty years before  --  on her honeymoon in New York 's ice and snow  --  Eustacia had seen in a store window a handpaintedcopy of Millet 's " The Angelus . " It had seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could fashion , and that to own it would introduce an unfailing benison into one 's life . In an adjacent window stood an alabaster model of the Taj Mahal . She had never heard of that edifice , but a printed card told its story . It was an homage to conjugal love . Changing lights so played upon it that it seemed to be revealed now at dawn , then at noon , then in moonlight . She thought of the rich people who could afford to purchase such treasure . Slowly she had learned that beautiful things are not for our possession but for our contemplation . At " St. Kitts " she had overmastered anger . At Fort Barry she divested herself of the last pangs of envy . George 's other friend was Olga Sergeievna Doubkov . The seamstress had been a frequent visitor in the home during his early years and had remained so until that day when she had left it in indignation , denouncing Breckenridge Lansing for his treatment of his son . She had spent long hours with Eustacia and Felicite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gussets and f euilletes and entrelacements . On occasional evenings when it was certain that the master of the house would not return , she could be persuaded to stay to supper . At first the younger children resented the presence of the " sewing lady , " but gradually they came to look forward to it . They found her conversationabsorbing . In her home in Russia the Countesses Olga and Irena had been brought up by French , German , and English governesses . Their parents , before dressing for dinner , visited them in the nursery at the end of the day . Twice a month , however , thep339girls were invited , with much formality , to dine with their father and mother . The girls knew well that when their parents gave a ball , when neighbors came to dinner , when there were guests stayingin the house , conversation was generally conducted in French . When they dined with their children the conversation was conductedin Russian . They never discussed the governesses , the neighbors , the daily life . Their mother talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father talked about the achievements of great men  --  about Mr. Watts and his steam engine , Dr. Jenner and his inoculations , and about balloon ascensions . He talked about the wonders of nature  --  about comets and volcanoes and beehives . Above all they talked about Russia , its history , its greatness , its holiness , its future  --  that future that would astonish the world . No mention was made of things that might be improved in Russia . Their father was to talk of those later , after they had crossed the border . So it was that Miss Doubkov , seated at the supper table at " St. Kitts , " talked about foreign countries and great artists , and Mr. Edison 's lamp and talking machines , about what men had uncoveredin the ashes at Pompeii . Moreover , Miss Doubkov found delicate ways of expressing her admiration for her hostess . It gave George great pride to hear his mother praised . His glance slid to her face to make sure that she heard these tributes . Miss Doubkov even spoke of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day came when she told them about Russia , its history , its greatness , its holiness , and its future  --  that future that would astonish the world . She told them of the great Tsar who had built his capital on a marsh , of another who had freed the serfs , of the glories of Pushkin , of the immensity and the beauty of the country . George asked , " Miss Doubkov , what language do they talk in Russia ? " " The Russian language . " " Will you talk some Russian to me . . . please ! "  |p340Miss  Doubkov paused , looked gravely into his face and addressedhim in Russian . He listened spellbound . " What did you say , Miss Doubkov ? " " I said , George , son of Breckenridge '  --  that 's the way grownupsaddress one another  --  I said , You are young . You are not happy now because you have not yet discovered the work to which you will give your life . Somewhere in the world there is a work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honor and loyalty . For every man there is one great task that God has given him to do . I think that yours will demand a brave heart and some suffering ; but you will triumph . ' " There was a silence . George sat as one turned to stone . Anne looked at her brother as though she had never seen him before . " How do you know that , Miss Doubkov ? " asked Anne . " Because George resembles my father . " Thus began the strange friendship between a boy not yet sixteen , the town 's " holy terror , " and a Russian spinster nearing fifty . It gathered strength quickly  --  at the supper table and after supper in the living room . It grew by fits and starts , for boys , like young animals , spasmodically tire even of the thing that most engages them ; and because George was being sent away to one school after another . Perhaps he arranged to be expelled from them in order to return to these conversations . " My father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were hunting for him . He shaved his beard and moustacheand his eyebrows . He disguised himself as an old woman crossing the country on a religious pilgrimage . We sang hymns and begged . We were covered with religious medals . I 've shown some of them to Felicite . " " Yes . " " My mother was ill . We bought a two-wheeled cart and pulled her along with us . We had money hidden on us , but to avoid suspicion we begged and slept in monasteries . " " What did your father do that was bad ? " asked Anne.  | " He had a secret printing press in the house . He printed pamphlets . " " What are pamphlets ? " " Keep quiet ! " said George . " He believed that the only hope for Russia was to overturn the government . He hoped to prepare the people for a revolution without violence . Already in every city and town there were men and women working with this same purpose in mind . Finally , however , my father no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People read them and did nothing . My father used to say that the Russian people talked to avoid decision . My father made other plans . " Her listeners waited . Suddenly Miss Doubkov made the gesture of hurling an object forcefully across the room . " Why did you do that , Miss Doubkov ? " asked Anne . " Be quiet ! " said George . Eustacia said faintly , " But , surely , there are better ways of arriving at good government than that ! " " Than what , Mama ? " " Hush , dear . " " Anne , I will tell you a story . Have you ever seen a muzzle on a dog ? " " No . What 's a muzzle ? " " It 's a band of leather bound around a dog 's nose . Sometimes it 's a little straw basket strapped to his nose . " " So he wo n't bite anybody . But how can he eat , Miss Doub-kov ? " " The lion is the king of all beasts , Anne . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit to what he can do when he wishes . Once upon a time in Africa there was a great king Lion who put muzzles on all the other lions  --  and on the tigers and panthers , too . He put muzzles on all of them except on his family and his twenty cousins . These other animals could only open their mouths a little bit . When they were hungry they could only eat veryp342small animals . But the great king and his family and his twenty cousins could eat all the deer they wanted  --  and all the antelope and gazelles . And they ate and ate . But some of those young lions found ways of loosening the muzzles on their noses , so the king thought up something else . He tied up their front paws with straps and bands so that they could n't run fast . There was a banquet every night in the king 's palace , but all those other lions went around limping , limping , with those shameful boxes on their noses . There was joy in the palace every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " cried the children . " Was there any joy when a new lion cub was born ? " " No !  --  No ! " " Children ! Children ! You must n't get so excited ! " " So one day the other lions met together in a remote part of the jungle to talk about their wretched life . What could they do ? It seemed to them that there was only one thing to do . " " I know , " said George , striking the sides of his chair . His face was white . Miss Doubkov went on as though she had not heard him . " The worst part about the whole situation , Anne  --  remember !  --  was that the lion is the noblest of all the animals in the forest . The Russian nation is the greatest nation that has ever lived on the face of the earth . No nation loves so deeply the land in which it lives . No nation is so brave in its own defense  --  as Napoleon discovered and lost a mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The countries of Europe are decaying daily . I have seen them . They are in a race for wealth and pleasure . They have forgotten God . But the people of Russia bear God in their hearts , like a man carrying a lantern under his coat on a stormy night . " Here she paused and lowered her voice . " Russia is the Christ-bearing country . She is the Ark that will save the human race when the great floods come . Here in America you have not even a nation . Every man thinks of himself before he thinks ofp343his country . That 's why it was shameful that one lion and a few cousins  --  one handful of unworthy lions  --  could reduce all the other lions to the level of starving dogs . And my father saw that there was only one thing to be done . " " To kill him ! To kill him ! " cried George , rising , and going to the wall he hammered it with his fists . " George ! " called his mother . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling to his knees and pounding the floor . " George , " said his mother . " Come finish your supper and control yourself . " George rose , hurled some bombs through the windows and dashed out of the house . Felicite slipped out after him . " My children are so high strung , Olga . It 's their Creole blood . " She went to the front door , looked out , and returned with an anxious expression on her face . " My mother had a terrible temper .  --  And her father ! Nobody could do anything with him . " " Maman , why did George get so excited ? " " Sh , dear . We all get a little excited when we hear about injustice . " Felicite found her brother lying face downward on the croquet court . He was panting and exhausted . They had a long whispered conversation . Finally they returned to the dining room . George stood by the door . " Miss Doubkov , will you teach me how to talk Russian ? " Miss Doubkov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn . She could find nothing to say . " George , " said Anne , " you 're crazy . You could n't learn anything . You were the worst student in the whole school and you 've been sent home from three other schools already . " " I can learn anything , if I want to learn it . " " But , George , " said his mother , " you 'd have no opportunity to speak it , except to Miss Doubkov . " " I 'll have to speak it when I go to Russia . "  | " Finish your supper and we 'll think about it . " " I 've thought about it already . " Breckenridge Lansing was not told about these lessons . They were conducted in the linen room under the Illinois Tavern or in the Rainy Day House . Eustacia insisted on paying for them and Miss Doubkov accepted half the price offered her . Miss Doubkov had no experience of teaching languages , but she suspected that her pupil 's progress was remarkable . He himself devised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and engaged a room ; he ordered a meal in a restaurant and , becoming a waiter , served it . In Moscow he bought a fur hat , a dog , a horse . He went to a theatre . He revisited the theatre by the " artists ' entrance . " He put questions to the leading actors . He went to church and even learned some of the liturgy in Old Slavonic . He went to taverns and fell into conversation with young men of his own age ( twentythreeand twenty-four ! ) . He discussed good and bad government with them . He reminded them that Russia was the greatest country the world had ever seen . His progress between lessons astonished his teacher . ( In Russian : " Well , Olga Sergeievna , I take walks and I talk and I pretend I 'm in Russia . " ) Miss Doubkov gave him the dictionary that her father had bought in Constantinople thirty-five years ago . She lent him her New Testament , which he read with his mother 's French version . " Mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's like it 's more a man 's book . " There came the day when he asked his teacher , in a low voice , to repeat those words which she had said to him in Russian " Which words , George , son of Breckenridge ? " " The first words I ever heard in Russian . " She repeated them slowly , as best she could remember them . He needed no translation . To the impassioned will nothing is impossible . He was finding direction . His voice deepened . He was helpful about the house . He cleaned the eaves , hung out laundry lines , smoked out hornets ' nests , dried the dishes . He was not only punctual at meals , but during his father 's frequent absencesp345he set out to replace him . He praised what was set before him . He inspirited the conversation . He had inherited his mother 's gift of mimicry and told long stories about the schools from which he had been ejected . Particularly fine was his account of Dr. Kopping , a Protestant clergyman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Educational Camp . Dr. Kopping , " just another boy himself at heart , " closed each day with a short talk about the council fire , inculcating the manly virtues . Anne would run around the table and throw herself at him . " George ! George ! Do the housemother at St. Regis 's ! Do Dr. Kopping again ! " The virulence of these caricatures made his mother uneasy . She had reason to be . George did not mimic his father in her presence , nor in Felicite 's . When they were out of the room , however , he regaled Anne with some astonishing portraits  --  her father killing birds and rabbits , her father exhausted after his hard day 's work at the mines , her father " washing his hands " of George , her father fulsomely endearing himself to her , to " Papa 's little angel . " In a very short time Anne doted on her brother ; in a very short time she discovered that her father was ridiculous . Anne accepted correction from George . He seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their feet , when it is time to go to bed . When they go to bed they make a curtsy to their mother and say , " Thank you , dear mother , for all that you have done for me . " They curtsy also to their older sisters . And if they have been very good , one or other of the princes , their brothers , carries them upstairs to bed in his arms and says a prayer over them in Old Slavonic . If George was planning to be an actor , he did not wait for the glitter of the footlights ; he played the head of a noble household at " St. Kitts . " All the Lansings were impassioned conversationalists ; though Felicite 's interventions were rare they were pondered . There was reading aloud ; any scene from Moliere or Shakespeare set in motion a long discussion . Night after night Eustacia despaired of getting them to bed at ten-thirty . It was Anne who benefited most fromp346these hours of wide-ranging conversation . There was now a new Anne , maturing rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overnight assignments in a mere quarter of an hour in order to take part in the evening 's symposium . Occasionally Breckenridge Lansing returned at ten from some lodge meeting . On opening his front door he would be aware for a few seconds of the warmth and intellectual energy of this home life , and of the sudden silence introduced by his presence . One evening he admitted himself soundlessly and stood listening in the hall : " Maman , Miss Doubkov says that Russian writers are the greatest writers that ever lived . And the greatest of them all was a Negro . Papa says that Negroes are n't even people and that it 's no use teaching them to read and write . " ( " Cheri , everyone can have his opinions . " ) " Well , Papa 's opinions are pretty silly most of the time . " ( " George , I do n't want you to talk about your father like that . Your father is  --  " ) " His opinions ! I do n't care what he says about me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George ! Talk about something else ! " ) " When he says about you that you have n't any more brains than what God gave a gopher  --  " ( " That 's just his joke . " ) " It was a BAD JOKE . And when he broke that shell on the mantel that your mother sent you  --  " ( " George , it was just a shell ! " ) " He STAMPED on it ! It came from the place that you were BORN at ! " ( " The older we grow , the less we 're attached to things , George . " ) " Well , I 'm attached to my pride , Maman  --  and to YOUR pride . " Lansing did not risk eavesdropping a second time . One of the reasons Eustacia did all she could to render these evenings engrossing ( she cut clippings from periodicals ; she sent to Chicago for books and for reproductions of paintings ) was to keep George off the streets . George inside the walls of " St. Kitts " was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infuriatethe town . He was the " holy terror " and the Big Chief of the Mohicans . No amount of supplication on his mother 's part could alter that . He listened to her with a stormy face , his arms folded , his gaze on the wall over her shoulder.  | " Maman , I 've got to have some fun . I 'm sorry , but I 've got to have some fun . " Eustacia knew well that the outrages were conceived and executed with one sole purpose  --  to drive his father to distraction . He rejoiced in his father 's contempt . He , too , seemed to be waiting for something  --  for his father to strike him , or to order him out of the house forever ? Under the rain of his father 's sneers and denunciations he stood with lowered eyes , motionless and with no shade of impertinence in his manner . " Do you realize that you 've brought disgrace on your mother and myself ? " " Yes , sir . " " Do you realize that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good word to say for you ? " " Yes , sir . " " Why do you do it ? " " I do n't know , sir . " " I do n't know , sir ! Well , in September I 'm sending you to a new school I 've heard about where they do n't stand for any nonsense . " The Mohicans soon outgrew reversing road signs and tinkeringwith the town clock . They did little damage to health or property ; they merely affronted decorum and right thinking . They staged complicated , well-rehearsed practical jokes that ridiculed banks , the laying of cornerstones , revivalist meetings . There was only one of the Mohicans ' recreations that brought the Chief of Police to the door . It terrified Eustacia . The boys enjoyed riding " possum clancy . " Hoboes , by hundred and thousands , traveled about the country on freight trains . When a long train pulled into a railroad yard it often dropped a score of these passengers , like blackberries off a bough . When they found entrance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on couplers , they were said to be riding " roost " ; when they stretched out on the undersides of the cars , clutching or strapping themselves to the " riggers , " they were riding " possum clancy . " It was exciting and dangerous.  |p348George  and his friends often traveled to Fort Barry or Summerville and back in a single night . " George ! Promise me never to ride those freight trains . " " Maman , you know I took a vow never to make any promises . " " For my sake ! George , for my sake ! " " Maman , wo n't you let me give you just one hour of Russian lesson a week ? " " Oh , cheri , I could n't learn Russian . When would I use it ? " " Well , when I 'm in Russia and get settled down , you and the girls are coming over to live with me . " " George ! !  --  Who would take care of your father ? " She begged him to stay in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want you to have an education , George . " " I 'm better educated than the fellows in those schools . I know algebra and chemistry and history . I just do n't like examinations . And I do n't like sleeping in a room with three or eight or a hundred other people . They stink . And they 're so babyish .  --  You 're an education , Maman . " " Oh , do n't say a thing like that ! " " Papa went to college and he has n't any more education than a flea . " " Now , George ! I wo n't have you saying such things . I wo n't have it . " Eustacia had a greater concern : was George subject to " fits " ? Was he , perhaps , " crazy " ? She had no clear idea what " fits " were , nor did she know any marks by which to distinguish insanity . At the beginning of this century such afflictions and dreads were too shameful to discuss with anyone except one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lansings ' family doctor was extremely hard of hearing . Even if Eustacia had respected Dr. Gridley 's skill , she could not have brought herself to shout the details of George 's behavior . Years ago Breckenridge Lansing had quarreled with Dr. Gillies . Dr. Gillies had contradicted himp349with characteristic finality on a matter of medical knowledge . Lansingdid not lightly brook contradiction . He had taken a year of premedical training in his youth . His father was the best pharmacist in the state of Iowa and Breckenridge had assisted him for over two years in the family drugstore . He knew more about medicine " in his little finger " than that old horse doctor had acquired in a lifetime of practice . He refused to greet Dr. Gillies on the street . He instructed Eustacia that henceforward they would consultDr . Jabez Gridley , the doctor serving the mine 's infirmary . Dr. Gridley was a superannuated " Poor John " employee , like so many others . In addition to being " deaf as a post , " his eyesight was failing . If you described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , he could occasionally be of service to you . Eustacia consulted her various household manuals  --  A Home Book of First Aid and While Waiting for the Doctor  --  and learned that the boy did not exhibit the classical symptoms of epilepsy . Moreover , she knew that he was so thoroughly an actor that it was difficult to distinguishbetween his abandoning himself to imaginative fantasies and his being out of his senses . He would beat with his fists on the floor and bay like a famished wolf ; he would tear around the room in circles and dash up and down the stairs shouting " mahogany " or " begonia . " In his love of danger he would balance himself on the roof and gables of " St. Kitts " under the full moon , or would climb the taller butternut trees and swing from treetop to treetop at three in the morning . He would cross Old Quarry Pond with ropes when the ice was already cracking to the accompaniment of the most musical pings . The townspeople and even his subjugated Mohicans were in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eustacia had a high opinion of Dr. Gillies ( whose wife was perfectly aware that he was " slavishly " admiring of Mrs. Lansing ) and had frequently consulted him without her husband 's knowledge . She paid for these visits Felicite 's anemia and Anne 's ear-aches  --  out of her own pocket . She called on him now . Dr. Gillies consented to have a long talk with George . George gave ap350remarkable performance of intelligence , equilibrium , wit , and good manners . Dr. Gillies was not deceived . " Mrs. Lansing , get that boy out of Coaltown or you 'll have trouble . " " But how , Doctor ? " " Give him forty dollars and tell him to go to San Francisco to earn a living . He 'll be able to take care of himself very well . He 's not crazy , Mrs. Lansing ; he 's just caged . You run a great risk when you cage a living human being . There 'll be no fee for that consultation , Mrs. Lansing . I had a very interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh . Eustacia shrank from fulfilling the doctor 's recommendation , but held ready a purse containing forty dollars . The measure of Breckenridge Lansing 's unhappiness could be gauged by the extent of his boasting . He was the happiest man in the United States . It had taken twenty years of hard work and careful management , but  --  by golly !  --  those mines were producing as they had never produced before . A well-run loving American home  --  that 's the ticket ! There 's nothing like returning at the end of the day to one 's own family . His listeners lowered their eyes . He was not only unhappy but frightened . He loved his clubs and lodges , but in spite of the fact that he was the first citizen in town he was no longer elected to their prominent offices . The men in Coaltown were divided into two classes  --  those who wore high starched collars even in the hottest weather , and those who did not . The former group did not frequent the taverns up the River Road . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitching Post . They did not return at dawn from Jemmy 's shack where , between card games , whole nights were spent in attempts to whip up bloody fights between roosters , dogs , cats , foxes , snakes , and drunken farmhands . If a respectable family man felt the need of a little diversion and dissipation , he arranged a business trip to St. Louis or Springfield or Chicago . Lansing did not at first understand some warnings that were thrown out to him by the governors of his clubs . Within the memory of manp351no member had ever been ejected from those august assemblies , but a limit to their patience could be foreseen . Lansing had set out to found that greatest of all institutions  --  a God-fearing American home . He held that a husband and a father should be loved , feared , honored , and obeyed . What had gone wrong ? His conduct was not above reproach  --  he knew that ; but no red-blooded man 's is . His father 's had n't been . In the conductof affairs he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He conceded that he had no talent for details . His strength lay in vision and planning ; one could always leave detailsto spiritless drones . Lansing was wretched , frightened , and bewildered . During the trial Breckenridge Lansing 's character emerged without blemish . Humans shield humans whose frailties do not threaten their property and whose virtues do not devaluate their own . Ashley was that alien body from another climate  --  from the future , perhaps  --  who , in all times and places , has been expelled . In the world inhabited by the Lansings of Iowa and Coaltown , it was generally understood that no man is ever sick . Sickness among males ends at fifteen and begins again , among the less hardy , at seventy . This lent a fine irony to the daily greetings  --  " Well , Joe , how are you ? " " Just bearing up , Herb ; just creeping around . " When , therefore , in February , 1902 , Breckenridge Lansing confessed to his wife that he was n't feeling well , that his " food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " sort of burning and a sort of pinching " in his stomach , Eustacia realized the extent of his suffering at once . He refused at first to see Dr. Gillies and asked for Dr. Gridley . When Eustacia pointed out that he would be obliged to shout the details of his discomfort within the hearing of half Coaltown , he consented to receive Gillies , " that old horse doctor . " Eustacia was waiting on the front steps at the close of Dr. Gillies 's visit . " Mrs. Lansing , he does n't want to tell me anything . Do you think he 's feeling real pain ? " " Yes , I do . "  | " He would n't even let me palp him for more than a minute . Told me I was fooling around in the wrong area . Gave me detailed orders about just where I should palp . I told him there was a possibility that he was very ill . I advised him to see Dr. Hunter in Fort Barry , or even to go to Chicago . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where 's a desk ? I want to write you some instructions . " The doctor sat down and thought . Turning , he looked Eustaciain the eye . " I 'm writing a list of questions about his symptoms . Send one of the children over to me every noon with a bulletin .  --  Mrs. Lansing , the whole town knows that your husband 's refused to speak to me on the street for six years . That disqualifies me from operating on him or from being of much use . You should ask Dr. Hunter to come down and see him . The sooner the better . Does he get on well with Dr. Hunter ? " Eustacia raised her eyebrows . " You have a hard time ahead , Mrs. Lansing . I 'll do what I can . " Lansing insisted that his bed be made up on the first floor in the " conservatory " off the dining room . The word " pain " was never mentioned in the house ; there was much talk about whether he was comfortable or not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he bellowed for a steak . When he was uncomfortablehe was given some drops of laudanum . For days at a time he appeared to recover . At the first sign of comfort he dressed and walked the length of the main street . John Ashley called every day and brought him a large sheaf of office bulletins to sign , thus enabling him to carry on admirably his duties at the mine . The town followed Lansing 's illness with great interest . During the trial the conviction lay at the back of the judge 's and jurymen 's minds that Ashley and Eustacia Lansing had for months been trying to poison the murdered man . Night after night , night after night , Eustacia sat near **26;8366;TOOLONG paid no further attention to either of them . He thought vigorously for a moment , then crossed the hall to 412 , the door of which was ajar . Fully dressed , Starr sat on the far bed in the same benumbedstate as Lois . He blinked wistfully at Harry 's greeting . Harry said : " Look , Andy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sright , " Starr answered hoarsely . " So let 's have a few drinks and hit the sack early . We 'll get a fresh start tomorrow . O.K ? " Starr nodded as if in the grip of palsy , squeaked gratefully , and Harry called room service to send up a couple of quarts of rye . His plan was this : to encourage Starr to drink himself into insensibility again , and then to interrogatehim , to say certain provocative things into his ear that might touch off , as under hypnosis , some drunken , sleeptalkingresponse . Harry by now had not the slightest interest in the series of articles he and Dilworth were supposed to write : he wanted only to get a confession out of Starr . Yet he was still a responsible newspaperman . He made the reverse trip across the hall , to ask Dill to go ahead and fake the first installment . They just might be able to get away with it : an overblown description of what met the father 's eyes as he arrived at the apartment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billie in his arms as a baby , et bullshit cetera , a kind of introduction to gain time . But Dilworth was no longer in the room ; he had been in earnest , then , about taking the whore home . Harry could not figure him out . He was fairly certain Dill did not want to lay her , which surely he could have done more conveni/ently in the hotel room than anywhere else , unless he would have been embarrassed to have Harry know . But if that were his concern he would not openly have gone off with her now . Harry could see no professional reason for Dill 's further association with Lois , and still less any personal motive . After all , he had been opposed to calling her in the first place . The room-service waiter showed up with the beer and club sandwiches . Being in good appetite and thirst , Harry engorged Dill 's share as well as his own.  | " YES , " SAID BETTY . She had changed from the bereaved daughter and sister Tierney had interviewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , by a professional in those matters , that tended to rigidify her head by exposingthe ears . She had also developed a cynicism , an edge to her voice . " Yes , " she said , using the word as a negative , " I saw in the paper that you were looking for Joe . " They were in the sitting room of the hotel suite . Arthur had gone down to the barbershop . Betty had thought Tierney attractive on Christmas Eve , but it was true she had then been distraught . She could see now that he had no expanse of heart or mind : detectives after all were merely a sort of policemen . Tierney observed that she had not mentioned Detweiler when he asked her about the other boarders.  | " Which should prove something , " said Betty . " He 's the last person I would think of in connection with anything horrible . " She gave Tierney a keen , poignant look ; that is , she produced such a look for whoever was there to witness it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him in any personal sense . Betty wanted to talk about knowing Detweiler , how he was in love with her , how she had broken his heart . Yet her taste told her to suppress these data , and that decision was confirmed by her intelligence . She did not want to get Joe into trouble . He could not have committed the crimes , but he was a weak and confused person and , if badgered by policemen with their routine theories about rejected lovers , might strike a self-damaging attitude . He was sensitive to a fault . Betty liked him a lot , but as a type of brother . " Do you know where Detweiler is at the present time ? " " No . " " Where he might be ? " No . " Has he got in touch with you recently ? " " Huh-uh . " " When was the last time ? " Betty was most reluctant to break the negative progression ; it gratified her to deny Tierney . " Oh I do n't recall , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's a dreamer . " " Seen him since you were married ? " " Definitely no . " Tierney asked : " Were you lovers ? " To an American cop this meant did they hold hands and go to the movies together . To Betty , who read certainp104novels , the term signified a couple whose sexual organs regularly met . Once more she was entitled to say no . Arthur returned from the barbershop , smelling of talc and lotion but looking the same : he had merely a light trim , costing him plenty nevertheless , and he did not have the nerve to put it on the tab that the newspaper would pay . It bothered him that the paper should provide his room and board ; Betty 's , all right , but he was doing nothing for his . He was a moralist of the old school . He greeted Tierney , and the detective responded by askingabout Joseph Detweiler . " A nice guy , " Arthur said . " An awfully nice guy . " " Did either of you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent or show any tendency toward vio-lence ? " Arthur was flattered by being included in , but he had to admit that he had really seen so little of Det --  " Certainly not , " Betty said with some heat . " You 're completely on the wrong track . I do n't think Joe would slap a mosquito that was sucking his blood . " " How did he get along with your mother ? " " I 'll just say this , " said Betty , " with all it implies : he called her Mom . He was a real member of the family . " " The brother that you never had , " Arthur added helpfully , unconscious of the double entendre . Betty 's trouble had always been that when she found a man with whom she felt intellectual affinity , he did not appeal to her physically , and vice versa . She could hardly bear to be alone in Arthur 's presence unless he was pawing her . " And your sister ? " asked Tierney . Betty passed a hand across her high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The funeral is this morning . Tierney made the usual catch-all excuse , that he was merely doing his job . Then : " If Detweiler is as harmless as you say , then he has nothing to fear . But you know , variouspeople see various sides of a given individual . We have heard that Detweiler could be a crank about noise . At anotherplace where he lived for a while , he assaulted a fellow roomer because he was annoyed by his radio . " " Whose radio ? " Betty pointed her nose at Tierney 's scalp . " I do n't believe a detective should be ambiguous . Do you realize from what you said it could be Joe almost killed the roomer because the roomer was peeved at Joe 's radio ? " Tierney replied with sarcasm . " Lady , I 'm not a writer like you . I 'm just a simple-minded police officer , stupidly looking for the practical joker who choked your family to death so you could stay in a luxury hotel for the holiday season . " Arthur had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow . Then it dawned on him that the detective was being rude . " Officer , " he turned gravely and said , " you are coming perilously close to slander . More of that and you 'll find yourself in a very awkward situation . " Arthur was rather formidable when his rights were threatened : he often predicted lawsuits against double-parkers who obstructed his car , neighborhood hi-fi owners whose apparatus smote his nervous system . Tierney stared sardonically at his own shoes , which happened at the moment to be damp from melted snow . He refused to wear rubbers , but he was always touched by his wife 's urging them on him . " Well , you just do that , Mr. Bayson , " he said , thoughp106Arthur had not specified any form of action , " but meanwhileI have to find a murderer . You fight the police ; that 's real smart . " Arthur failed to get out an answer before his indignation evaporated . Obviously Tierney was a decent individual and an efficient practitioner ; no doubt he had his reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Betty 's energy occasionally focused on meaninglesstargets . Arthur mentally threw up his hands and turned again to look out the window . He might take a walk in the afternoon , if the snow had not got too deep On the other hand , the worse the weather , the less likelihood one would be mugged . He must ask Tierney whether it was true that , as he had heard , fewer crimes were committed in inclement seasons : if so , it indicated that criminals were normal in at least that respect . With the supreme effort of an aircraft leaving the clutch of earth , Tierney climbed above the situation , and asked impersonally : " Does Detweiler make a living with his art ? " Bored by Arthur 's intervention , Betty suddenly reversed her style . " I do n't know , " she said . " I suppose nobody ever knows what anybody else might do . " Her smile expressed pathos . " We are all basically strangers . Perhaps back of his facade Joe is a monster . There 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that scare me , from time to time . I believe I could kill , having the opportunity . " Tierney disregarded this useless confession but of course did not let on to Betty , rather stared narrowly at her as if considering seriously whether she might be the murderer , which he divined was what her ego demanded . He sawp107that heretofore he had been far too impersonal with her . " I suppose you could . A lovely face can conceal a black heart . " This was certainly a purple passage in Tierney 's idiom , and ordinarily he could not have pronounced its like except in temporary irony . But now his attitude towards Betty was becoming wholly ironical , a definitive role . Years before , Tierney had played the part of a girl in a class play at his all-male high school . In the street-clothes rehearsals he could not bring himself to mimic feminine attitudes : his soul dropped a portcullis against that distortion . But once in full disguise , frock and flowered hat and high heels ( feet killing him ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hips , and vainly touch his wig with two sets of fingertips when under observation by a boy playing a boy ; that is , when the entire context was make-believe , so was the code . No one could say that in real life Tierney displayed an iota of swishiness , but in this single case of dramatic invention his imposture was pronounced superb by a guffawing audience who knew him otherwise as the football team 's high scorer  --  precisely the point of the joke . So he glanced now at Betty 's shiny knees before coolly meeting her eye , acknowledging her body on the way up , as it had not really occurred to him to do earlier because both he and she were married . As it was an aspect of his professional performance , he made no attempt to conceal this from Arthur , who had heard the speech flattering Betty and turned to watch him . Arthur usually felt only pride when his wife 's person evoked admiration from other males , did not even take umbrage at teen-age catcalls towards the concentrically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Law . To detect evidences of lasciviousness , or indeed anyp108personal appetite , in him was to fear for the future of the common weal . Arthur plodded across and put his hand on Betty 's shoulder , announcing stiffly : " I think that 's enough questions for today . " Having at last and by accident established a rapport with Betty , Tierney disposed of her husband . He said , flagrantly staring at her body , " Let 's let Mrs. Bayson decide for herself . She looks very healthy and self-reliant to me . " The wind up was in Betty . Her head , in the new hairdo , felt helmeted . Whereas with the queer reporter she had resisted Arthur 's interference , she now intertwined her fingers with his , compounding her strength vis-a-vis the aggressivemaleness of Tierney , who was one of the policemenwho had beaten her father , whose statements she had jealously read in the rival newspaper . Tierney had a granite jaw ; a short but jutting nose ; a hard crewcut head . His left breast , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it seemed to Betty . ( It was the way Tierney sat , his jacket bunching out ; actually the .38 rode in a clipholsterat the side of his belt ; nor had he ever taken a life with it . ) " That 's all right , " she said , and each man supposed she was addressing him . " Things begin to come back to me when I think of Joe , since you insist , " she told Tierney . " You ask about his art work . He modeled a head of me once , laboringover it for weeks . It was not a photographic-type resemblance , of course . Mother never liked it , and Billie thought it was funny ; it was bald , you see . Joe said hair was not basic to the structure , being arranged by what he called accident : you have it cut and set , and so on . But your basic bones do n't change . " Arthur continued in the jealous vein now , though whenp109he had called upon Betty in the old days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had had no qualms about him . Accusingly he said : " I never saw that . " " No , " Betty answered , still speaking to Tierney , Arthur after all being mostly behind her chair . " He called me into his room . There it sat , on the desk before him , my head , bald and cold but it was spiritually me all right : I always thought he had real talent . Then he said , handing me a little tack hammer , It 's your right , ' he said , to destroy this miserable image . ' He meant that in a flattering way ; it could n't do justice , he said , to the living original . But I refused : Oh no , Joe . Oh no . ' He said , Then it 's my right . ' And with true zeal he struck it once in the center of my skull and a lot of cracks appeared , then slowly the fragmentsparted and fell . I felt very queasy . " Betty waited . Tierney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Detweiler was wrong in the theory that only the fundamental structure mattered . Human beings were of a piece , including their attire . A skeleton was not necessarily basic . Look at Tierney being intellectual ! thought Tierney , catching himself up . There was something corrupting in the subject of Detweiler . God damn him . Tierney began to hope he would prove innocent , but he wanted to find him first . Betty got tired of waiting . " ' Right ' was the word he used . " Arthur made a blurred noise and dropped her hand . " Aw , Betty , I do n't think it 's wise to take that pretentious talk seriously . " He was still jealous but saw his motive as rather a concern that if Betty made too much of this non/sense she might get Detweiler into hot water . He wondered whether she realized she had changed her tack and was being damaging to the guy and for what ? Vanity . Ordinarily Arthur saw that quality as an aspect of his wife 's hearty response to life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be forgotten in a rush of hotel suites , newspaperarticles , steaks , snowfall , the posing of a would-be artist : let 's , Arthur said silently , get back to the law of gravity . " Right , ' Betty repeated , unmoved by the plea . She kept staring ever more brightly at Tierney , but he refused to crack . Choosing to pretend the whole performance was in answer to the question he had asked at the outset , he instead asked : " Then how did he make a living ? " Snorting in laughter , Arthur came back into play . " Stuffinganimals ! " He walked self-consciously away from Betty 's chair , shoulders high as if he were cold : he was dramatizing the absurdity of the information . He shot himself onto the far end of the sofa of which Tierney occupied the cushion nearest Betty , threw out his heels , punched together his large white hands . Tierney : " Huh ? " " Taxidermist , " said Arthur . " Where ? " Arthur splayed his feet , rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't know , " he said shyly . " Betty ? " But his wife , holding her ground , said : " He wanted to make something real , not reproduce or imitate what already existed . The original is always perfect because it is original . Which is not the easiest concept to grasp . "  | " Very interesting , " murmured Tierney , telling the truth ; he had heard and even , despite Betty 's implication , understood : he had been obliged at college to study Aquinas and other thinkers . But his clear and pressing duty was to establishin space and time the taxidermy shop , leaving metaphysicsto those professional at it . " Was this his own business or did he work for someone else ? " Suddenly Betty showed enthusiasm . " I went there with him once . We walked from home . I do n't know the name or address , but I could take you there probably . " Tierney rose and found a classified telephone book , as he knew he would , in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition : a beautiful virgin directory , and Tierney fingered it with reverence and a concomitant pleasure . Having located the rubric " Taxidermists , " he carried the book to Betty , who smoothed her lap to accept it , but he tarried until her hands reluctantly came up . He was all business . Head down , pink nail quickly exhausting the possibilities , too quickly , she soon said : " I do n't recognize any of these names . Never knew the right one . " " Then look at the addresses , " said Tierney , standing away . " No , " Betty said for each entry , " no , no , no . Do n't see any that could possibly be , unless he moved . " Arthur , resting or thinking under a visor of hand , heard a knock at the door , went to answer , and saw Alloway 's dungeatinggrin on the theshold . " It is eleven already ? " " Ten or so past , " the reporter said conscientiously throughP112chapped lips . " Hard to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll all go home , as they do when it rains . " Arthur nodded almost affably , discovering in himself a novel tolerance towards Alloway as a result of a new suspicionof Tierney . He gestured at the reporter 's coat , the snowflakes on which were hard to see , melted or whole , in the black-and-white houndstooth . " Better hang it in the bathroom . " Then pointed imperiously , so there could be no doubt , at Betty 's . Alloway colored slightly at this acknowledgment that Betty 's quarters were the peculiar locus of his needs , but he was getting anxious now to find out what Tierney was up to , had been trying with the other part of his attention to hear the detective over Arthur 's and his own commonplaces . He flopped his coat across the seat of the nearest straightback chair and , in distinction to the sidling movement in which he entered the suite , he stalked forthrightly at the detective , as the newsman that he was . " What 's the latest on Detweiler ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave him a tile-glazed eye , said : " Call the De-partment . " " And ask for Matthias , huh ? " Alloway returned , brandishinghis needle . Quick to sniff the bouquet of ill will , Betty asked : " Who 's that ? " " One of the real brains at Homicide , " said Alloway . " Taught Tierney everything he knows . " Alloway did n't give a crap about maintaining good relations with the police . As a pro of the written word , he always had one up on the cops , who were almost obliged to be inarticulate , and nowadayshe anyway usually did feature stuff , often exposes ofp113city departments , for which he got little official cooperation . He preferred to work with social reformers and critics , for whom he had contempt but who spoke in platitudes which were easily quoted , and criminals , whom he admired because they frightened him . Had he absolute power , Tierney 's first act would have been to abolish the freedom of the press . He had read Alloway'sinitial installments of Betty 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt would present a perverted image of Detweiler . Shuster had expressed his usual amoral satisfactionat that likelihood : " Might goose him into coming in . " Which was highly unlikely and still no excuse . Tierney could have bought his wife a new winter coat with what Alloway 's paper paid the hotel per diem to accommodate this vain bitch and her blockhead husband . He stood up and said commandingly : " I want a private word with you , Mrs. Bayson . " " Surely . " Betty loved this . She led Tierney to her bedroomwhile Arthur watched with little , angry bear-eyes , and Alloway stepped rapidly in their wake , calling to Tierney : " What are you trying to pull ? " Betty slammed the door on him , leaned against its inside surface , knee bent , foot lifted , as in the outmoded response to a kiss . Tierney gestured to her to come over by the window : the reporter might listen at the door . He said in an undertone : " You think you can find the taxidermy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detected Tierney 's odd smell , neither pleasing nor repugnant in the standard sense- : perhaps cleaning fluid or some Irish-Catholic incense . For her part Betty and also her room reeked of a costly scent she had obtained in the hotel drugstore and . put on the tab . Tierney pretended to himself that he was suffocating.  |p114He  disliked overdone women as well as spicy foods . He remembered what he had not noticed when it was current : that Betty had been attractive in a straight , clean , girlish way before she mucked herself up with hard hair and burnt eyes . Betty answered in a whisper , conspiring : " I said I could take you there . " Tierney felt foolish . He moved about , saw through the open bathroom door a set of beige underwear drying on the shower rod . " How soon can you shake off that reporter ? " Newspapermen often talked piously of keeping a confidenceif so requested by the police , but invariably proved treacherous in practice . It was like getting a hungry shark 's promise to ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , " said Betty , still whispering . Then , louder , she blurted : " Oh , I forgot the funeral . " The cheap little cunt , with no respect for the dead . And thinking that , Tierney knew his first faint desire for her . Like the banging of conscience , Arthur 's thumps sounded upon the door . He cried : " Betty , we better get started . " Alloway could be heard urgently querying : " Where ? Where ? " " When will you be back ? " asked Tierney . Betty replied , figuring : " There 's the service , then the trip to the cemetery , the burial , then the ride back . Maybe by four , four-thirty to be on the safe side . You pick me up here ? " As if she were making a date . But what Tierney found much more appalling was a tendency in himself to assume the same style : indeed , he identified hers by means of his own.  | " All right , " he said harshly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He hated having to explain . " Whatever your opinion , Detweiler is shaping up as a psycho . They are harder to trace than normal people , and we have n't got a line on him so far . If you can think of anything else about him it might help . But the reporter will blow it . " He saw her back in the dressing-table mirror , across the room , and beyondit his own still-collegiate face looking solemn , his newfoundirony against her ebbing , or perhaps altering to mere cruelty . " And hire the taxidermist to write his series . They do n't care , you see ? A few years ago reporters like Alloway found out the place and pickup time for the ransom of a little boy , went there in a crowd with camera trucks and radio cars parked all down the block , and scared off the kidnaper . He strangled the child and buried it in a marsh . " In the mirror Tierney saw the tips of his fingers appear over one of her shoulders , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral ardor , not animal lust . His hand did not seek to palpitate or warm or even feel ; else Betty would have cried out for Arthur and subsequently reported the incident to the police department . She would not suffer herself to be caressed extramaritally . But Tierney was stating a principle , and besides , was hurting her . She would show a bruise there tomorrow , a kind of insigne of office : Betty Bayson , honorary policewoman . " They have no , no  --  " Tierney struggled for an idiom , his iron claw deep into her tender shoulder muscles . In a secondshe would scream , not for help , not to bring about cessation , but rather to celebrate her enduring the unendurable : she , the frailest Starr , the one who so far had eluded wounding.  | " They have no decency , " said Tierney , his eyes charred , features drawn , like some fanatical , ascetic priest . Betty nodded dumbly , nostalgic for his torturer 's hand soon as he withdrew it , though her shoulder still chanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suite . When Betty emerged Alloway was still complaining . " You did n't tell me about the funeral . " He stood there tall and limp , his lower lip dangling . " Come along then and we can talk in the limousine , " Betty said , efficient again . " I do n't see any disrespect in that . After all , it 's an appropriate occasion for the subject matter . I sincerely believe my mother and Billie would approve . They never liked Joe Detweiler from the beginning . Now it turns out , in the irony of fate , that they had to die to confirm their intuition . " Alloway jotted this down while Arthur tried to clear an obstruction that blocked his throat , barricaded his eyes , and corrupted his breathing . He did not soon succeed : he understood for the first time that Betty was utterly wanting in a sense of justice . As fair play was at the essence of Arthur'smystique , on the one hand , and his life was **25;8394;TOOLONG with Betty 's , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbows with a madman . Therefore he relinquished his integrity and said nothing . Detweiler would presumably not be framed . Whatever Betty said , the police and the courts must establish evidence of his guilt before they could execute the poor devil . Public justice still prevails , whatever the private arrangements underwhich we labor , all of us who live with women . " I foolishly defended him , " Betty went on , not to Alloway but to her readers . " Certainly he was strange , but franklyP117I never saw the violence in him . The sensitive hands that worked so delicately in clay , that they might be lethal instruments . . . " Alloway requested her to slow down so he could get it word for word . " You ought to get a tape recorder , " Betty said . " I 'm misquotedrepeatedly in the first installment and you added things of your own . I certainly do n't mind cuts , because I understand the space problem , but to see material printed under my name that I did not utter  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , we ca n't print prejudicial statements against Detweiler until the police find him , and maybe not then unless he confesses immediately . If he does , of course we can go whole hog . " " That I know , " Betty said . " ' His hands might he lethal instruments . ' I 'm not saying they were . Yours or mine might be . " Or mine , thought Arthur , enjoying the newfound freedomof a fragmented personality . " Well , anyway , " said Betty , " he will confess when they get him . I know Joe Detweiler . He may be a murderer , but he 's not a liar . As for me , I feel only pity for him , not revenge . " P118DETWEILER HAD a gratifying journey , though many of the other passengers groused about the degeneration of the railroads ; the aisle was ankle-high in litter ; a half-dozen seats were broken ; the water tank was soon dry and never replenished ; the conductor materialized only to take tickets , smile at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had any sense of privation , Detweiler enjoyed roughing it . He thought of the oldtime travelers in their coaches , bumping along behind foam-flecked horses where these twin bands of shining steel now ran : incredible , what time had wrought . Earlier , a trackless waste ; and much , much earlier , acres of primeval slime in which dinosaurs wallowed , mastodons trumpeted ; preceding all that , the earth had been an undifferentiated , infinitesimal piece of the sun , a whiff of burning gas that had spun off the parent body , cooled , and solidified . A splendid mystery , a source of joy . P119Detweiler put his head against the cushion , his ankles on the opposite seat  --  one of the broken ones , so that he was denying nobody  --  and occupied with his universal reflections , in no time at all he had completed his journey . Fellow passengers had come and gone , he spoke to none . He was anonymous , pale and fair , almost invisible . In the middle of the night , lamps extinguished , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the train lurched . Awake but quiescent as a bundle of old clothes , Detweiler let the man collect himself and wander on , leavingbehind a sour odor , the stench of life unrealized : poor devil , groping through the night , benumbed , forsaking his instinctive strengths . Detweiler found it hard to understand such a person , easier to forgive him ; obviously he was the passive type , did not knowingly seek to obstruct the flow of transcendental energy , just occasionally tripped and fell in its way , could be stepped over . But next morning , having arrived at his destination , and taken a quick , refreshing wash-up in the station , Detweiler went out into the breath-catching cold of the yet snowless street , found a lunch counter , and there came across another kind of human being , that specimen who embodied negativeprinciples with positive force . It took Detweiler a while to understand , sitting there on the stool , facing the chromium-plated napkin container , that he was being ignored by the individual who should have taken his order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom Detweiler was initially of course sympathetic , looking forward as he was to a cup of steaming coffee milked down to a chocolate tan , and two doughnuts virginally dressed in sugar . He inhaled the perfume of the fried bacon , the bouquet of toast , thrilled to the yellow flowp120of egg on the plate of his right-hand neighbor . Though he could not himself afford such luxuries , he venerated all those who trafficked in them . Therefore he tolerated the counterman , who was deliberatelytidying up around the coffee urn with a stained rag , and called to him in a friendly voice . No response . Five other customers applied themselves to their cups and dishes ; some were friends and conversed in an amiable hum . Someonedeparted , squeezing along the narrow aisle behind Detweiler in a bulky coat , pleasantly brushing his back , blowing cigarette smoke over him , which , though he did not himself use tobacco , had an interesting , pungent , stimulatingaroma . Again he called out , no less genially should the man be deaf , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unspecified , neutral hatred , turned back , filled a coffee cup sloppily so that the saucer ran with liquid , served it up . " And two sugar doughnuts , please , " Detweiler said for the third time , as he saw the man act as if the exchange were closed . Again he was ignored . The counterman as of old worked with his brown rag . Detweiler lifted the napkin dispenser , found it of suitable weight  --  for he knew what he was doing and though enraged was not the victim of a feckless impulse  --  andwith ardent force and commanding accuracy threw it into the counterman 's head . The target jerked with the impact , white cap flying off as though winged . He fell forward into the coffee urn , cut his mouth or nose on a gleaming tap , folded , and dropped to the floor behind the counter , bleeding fore and aft . The other eaters froze in their respective positions , one with fork in the air ; another averted his eyes for a long moment . P121Detweiler left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack from the wall-hook , and since he had not partaken of the fare , walked past the front counterman , the one who doubled as cashier , without paying . " Hey , " said this person , torn between the cash register and his colleague on the floor , but not at all sure of which represented his principalresponsibility , if either . Detweiler was only vaguely conscious of the iterated " Hey 's " as he went through the door , taking the cold air in his face , and having turned the corner , forgot the incident utterly . He was not followed . By means of public conveyance Detweiler reached an area which he recognized through elapsed time rather than its name  --  he had no quarrel with Time in such practical applications , used it without thought  --  walked three blocks still guided by his instinct , entered a shabby building through a rank of ashcans , climbed three dark , odorous flights of stair , and knocked upon a twilit door . He heard someone shuffle up on the other side and throw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swinging back . There stood a woman , gray-haired , eyeglassed , medium-stout , but resembling him all the same , so much so that he got a queer catch in his throat when he looked into the eyes so companion to his own . " Hello , Mother , " said he . Mrs. Detweiler answered : " Hi , Joey . " She stepped aside for his entrance , scrubbing her hands on her print apron of blue and white . She said : " I bet you never had your break-fast . " " ' Bet ' ? " said Detweiler in ironic amusement , of which he was capable only with his mother , because in all the world she was for him the only eccentric . A spiritualist , she got most of her information from the other world ; henceP122Detweiler 's question : she seldom " bet , " being usually certain . In a certain defiance she said : " Was n't I right ? " He grinned and nodded . He was greatly fond of her . " Then come on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing up sometime today , so I got ready with all your favorites , made applesauce and a devil 's food cake and bought some of that rattrap cheese you like to melt and everything . " He followed her into the redolent kitchen , remembering that each time he came to visit she supplied a new list of his favorite foods , presumably obtained through spiritual channels  --  and never accurate , except in the sense that he was omnivorous and devoured everything with zest . But the few dishes that stood above the rest in his estimation  --  hot dogs covered with both chili con carne and sauerkraut ; very bard to obtain at lunch counters or street stalls , where it was usually either-or ; cherry Jello , rice pudding with raisins  --  she never seemed to hit upon . But then Detweiler had never thought spiritualism held water ; his mother was a real crank , though lovable . For breakfast he ate three wedges of chocolate cake , a bowl of applesauce , and over his mother 's protests , a cold , not melted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was thus occupied , sipping the Postum she favored as an evasion of coffee-nerves , ulcers , and cancer , " Joey , I hear you are getting along very well out there , making progress in every way , and you sure look good . You must be eating well . " " Yes , Mother , " Detweiler answered quite seriously . Though he might question the source of her information , which had probably come from some seance , he would not mock her . And anyway , he always told the truth , just asp123he invariably accepted as truth all that was stated to him . " Yes , I 'm doing fine . " " Just where is it you are located now ? " His mother dipped a crust of bread into the Postum and ate it neatly . Apparently her otherworldly data on him was none too specific . He told her , and added : " Everybody is real nice . " " Treat someone nice and he 'll be nice , " said Detweiler 's mother . " It runs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I met a Hindu from India the other day . He said , Hello , sister , we met once in another life ' . " His mother often encountered Asiatics in her circles and believed they saw farther than Occidentals , using the inner eye . She said : " Mr. Lall . He gave me a reading on you , Joey . It seems you are overcoming resistances and are going to make out well in the end if you stay patient . For you , animalsrepresent a positive value . Do you still work with animals , Joey ? " Detweiler finished his second glass of milk . " Oh , I am always somewhere near animals , Mother . You can bank on that . " Beside the plate he found the napkin in his old napkin ring , which had obviously been polished for his homecoming : his mother did give such demonstrations of clairvoyance . Detweiler never denied her gift ; it was just that predictions of the future had no utility for him . The central problem remained eternal : how a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reflection , no doubt , and no apology . A tiger killed , a rabbit ran , an owl sat motionless in daylight , a snake flowed along the ground ; and thesep124were not murder , cowardice , sloth , and guile , but rather respective expressions of peculiar truths . " Ahl " said Detweiler , slapping the napkin against the tabletop . " I forgot , I have a Christmas present for you , Mother . " He went to his haversack and brought from it a bundle wrapped in a maroon sweater . " Sorry I did n't have gift paper , but it would have been difficult to make a decent package of it anyway , because of the awkward shape . I hope you like it . " He wound off the sweater , being careful because the object within caught here and there on the weave , and at last revealed a common gray squirrel , stuffed and mounted on a base of varnished walnut . The small animal sat on its haunches and held a beechnut between two paws , not yet nibbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth twitch , so true it was . Mrs. Detweiler took it reverently into her broad-fingered hands , peered into the bright-button eyes , stroked the fur . " I like it , Joey . It is swell . If you do n't mind me saying so , it is more real-life than them clay images you used to make , and represents an advance in thought and mind . " Detweiler cocked his head against his right shoulder , an attitude in which he was usually photographed as a boy , an expression not of appeal , which is how it was often interpreted , but rather of contemplation . " It is n't bad , " he had to admit . " Of course you must understand it is dead , Mother , an attempt to preserve or to remember what was once perfect . This is no longer a squirrel , and for that reason there is a sadness about it . But sculpture starts as nothing , and thus if anything results from it , it is a triumph . " Mrs. Detweiler got her eyeglasses out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , put them on , and further inspected the stuffed animal , from time to time lookingbenignly over it at her son . " You are reaching out , Joey . You are crossing the barrier . " Detweiler stubbornly shook his head , not at her but at a thought of how little he had achieved . " I do n't do sculptureany more . It does n't go far enough . " A constriction developed in his throat , a weight fell behind his forehead . He sat down again . " Nor taxidermy . I quit my job with that guy . I worked for a while at a zoo , cleaning out cages and feeding animals so I could be near them , study their methods . But they do n't have methods , Mother , but ways , which are hard to understand if you are a human being , though we are also basically animals . " " With spirits , son , " his mother said gently , placing the squirrel alongside her cup . " Why do n't you come and lay down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old book , which I always kept , and I 'll read you about Peter Rabbit and Reddy Fox , like I used to and what started you out on animals in the beginning . " Though a crackpot perhaps , his mother was one of the finest people in the world and Detweiler tried always to please her , so he followed along patiently into the bedroom . Then , having removed his shoes , he lay down on the crazy quilt . His mother soon found the childish book , drew her chair from the sewing machine to the bedside , and in the light that penetrated the sooty curtains began to read . Before long Detweiler fell asleep . His mother continued to read aloud , simulating the various voices , Peter Rabbit in a high yet robust tone , Reddy Fox with a sinister halflisp . The pages opened easily and lay quite limp ; years agop126the binding had been cracked when Detweiler 's father threw it at her . Clegg had a big mother of a hangover in the morning , owingnot so much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters with Starr . When he raised the window for a clean breath , Starr woke up howling about the cold , predicting pneumonia . So down it came again , and Clegg returned to the twin bed alongside his subject 's , where he sat , too warm in shirtsleeves , in near asphyxiation from the sweetish rye-fumes emanating from Starr 's open mouth and the glassful on the night table between them . Soon as Starr 's breathing again indicated somnolence , Clegg began his crafty appeals to the man 's subliminal self . The first pitch , put in a soft , crooning voice , was : " I do n't blame you for doing it , Andy . They had it coming if anybodyever did . " Starr breathed on ; it was still too soon after the extinguishingof the lamp to get any optical intelligence of him . But even when Clegg 's night-vision was fully instituted , the room proved too dark to see much . He put on the bathroom light , leaving the door ajar , but shortly Starr cried out . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image of hell . " How did you do it ? " he said next , after an appropriate interval and in a voice of wonder . " That 's what I ca n't understand . A slender , sick man like yourself . Appleton outweighed you by forty pounds . " Starr turned over . Clegg persisted : " Tell me , Andy . I admireyou , a man who defends his home ! " Starr murmured into the pillow . Clegg stole across and put his ear close : " Beg pardon ? " He stopped off his inhalation , to defend himselfagainst Starr 's noxious exhale . Silence . " Billie was somep127piece , " Clegg whispered . " I envy the man who had her . She 'd be worth killing for . " Starr stirred . Clegg trembled , had to turn his head away to catch a breath . When he came back , Starr said in a dreamy mutter : " Shur off at fockin radio , lemme shleep . " Clegg withdrew , still far from discouraged . He had got a response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planted the seeds , he would stay awake all night to listen for the bloom . After some hours , however , the warm air and the darkness degenerated his will ; he fell into a coma , starting awake from time to time at the sound of human speech , but was too groggy to comprehend it : he seemed to be capped in foam rubber . When he at last came fully to , his watch put the time at 10 A.M. The drapes were pulled wide , and a snowy , eyehurtinglight was extant . Starr sat eating breakfast from a wheeled tray of silver-domed dishes . He was dressed again in the resort clothing . Turning his skinny neck in the Hawaiian shirt , he said to Clegg : " You know you talk in your sleep ? Kept me awake half the night . I almost walked out on you , and then where would your story be ? I want a private room from now on , get me ? I ai n't anybody you can push around . I can sell my story to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He used Clegg 's desolate look to flog himself into further indignation , strutting with his head and shoulders , though seated , spitting out little fragments of toast . " I ought to call your boss . " Clegg hauled up from the bed , swallowing with a tongue of suede . He stumbled to the bathroom and took a drink through his hand from the ice-water tap . Then he returnedP128to the bedroom and heard Starr say : " What do you think about that ? " Clegg walked across the room , thrust the breakfast table aside , lifted Starr by the collar with his left fist , and hit him in the mouth with the right . He saw blood on his hand : his own . He had cut his knuckle on one of Starr 's rotten teeth . By afternoon he was out of a job ; he was also codefendant , with his paper , in a suit for assault and battery . The paper 's big-time attorneys eventually battered Starr 's sleazy lawyer , by a combination of veiled money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suit was dropped . Starr 's fee for the series was increased , and Dilworth took over the writing thereof . Betty Bayson endured the funeral in a type of trance , though no one knew that to see her : she cried at the undertaker'sand again at the graveside , and at the latter was observed so doing by a crowd of those ghouls who manage to discover the loci of such events despite official secrecy . There were only about thirty of them , but most were hardcore , standing in shank-deep snow , passive except for one woman with milky blue eyes , who slipped past the guarding cop and asked Betty for an autograph , saying : " I 'm glad you done it , dear . God bless you . " Betty sniffled and sighed . Technically the burial was inconvenient owing to the snowfall . Snow was several inches deep in the open grave and still descended . Functionaries dusted it off the coffintopsnow and again , which appeared pathetic because pointless , since both receptacles would shortly go below ground and there lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This thought oc-P129cuffed to the Presbyterian minister who had been drafted into service though none of the Starrs , dead or alive , had been his parishioner . But he went where called by the mortician . A veteran of his trade , he had a kit , as it were , of phrases that would fit any mortal : of daughters , of mothers , of the bereaved ; and it was in no way disrespectfulor false that he used them in his valediction on the murderedStarrs . They were , or had been , human ; as was he ; as were all . Perhaps his remarks were more eloquent when applied generically than when he had known the deceased and could speak of particularities , death being the only truly universal event . He did his job at both mortuary and cemetery , and Arthur for one thought it very good indeed but avoided thanking him because of an embarrassing puzzlementas to whether or not a preacher should be tipped after a funeral as after a marriage . Alloway accompanied the Baysons throughout , but got little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fallen by surprise in the cab en route to the funeral parlor : it was not so much depression or despair or melancholy or sorrow as total nullity : suddenly everything , including herself , seemed to be made of frosted glass . Externally this was due to the falling snow through which one must needs peer in such weather . Within , however , it unaccountably contradicted her habitual sense of lucidity , which had if anything grown more assured in the days since the murders . Betty had always felt she immediately understood anything of an emotional or moral or intellectual nature . All at once , she did not . And did not care to , had no interest . She sat  --  or , at the graveside , stood  --  contemplating the absolute void , multiplying zeroes . It was neither a pleasantp130nor an unpleasant situation ; it was nothing at all , nonexistence . Her father did not show up for either part of the ceremony . Only Arthur had thought of notifying him , but did n't know where to look . Afterwards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hotel , Alloway made his conge , hotfooted it down to the paper , and wrote for tomorrow'sedition an account of Betty 's alleged reflections while viewing the obsequies : " As the caskets slowly sank from sight into the cold ground , I murmured a final farewellto my loved ones . Theirs would be the peace which passeth . ... " Tierney appeared promptly at four . While he had talked to Betty that morning , his ex-partner Matthias had shot himself . Shuster had taken Matty off active service pending a departmental hearing that would consider whether he had been negligent in leaving his extra pistol where the punk could lay hands on it . Only Matty knew , and Tierney suspected , that the punk had been given it by Mrs. Matthias . To safeguard what he was old-fashioned enough to regard as his honor , Matty had tried to blow his brains out . But from professional experience he knew that a suicide in which the subject discharges a firearm into the mouth is a nasty affair for those first to discover his remains : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wish to impose that unpleasantness on his wife , to whom he bore no ill will . So he got himself a room in a cheap hotel , a hot-bed establishment used by streetwalkers , a lair for petty criminals and junkies , and too quickly  --  because the mise en scene was unendurably degrading  --  he whipped his revolver towards his lips , pulled the trigger , and blew off the top ofp131his face , but remained quite alive , even conscious until doped at the hospital . The doctors predicted he would survive , though naturally with only one eye . Tierney spent the early afternoon hanging around the hospital though he was useless there , Matthias continuing under heavy sedation . Weirdly , Tierney lingered in hopes that Matty 's wife , whom he had never seen , would show up , and he suspected every forty-year-old woman in the visitors ' lounge of being she . What he had in mind was not clear to himself ; he could not imagine such a confrontation  --  which is why he stayed there for two hours ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Matthias did not appear , or if she did he could not identify her in the despondently furnished hall into which various folk trudged to sit somber-faced  --  though a few were merry : had either got the good news their loved ones were recovering or were malicious , sadistic types or perhaps merely heirs of someone whose condition had lately been pronounced hopeless . At last Tierney left the hospital and went to Betty 's hotel . " Where 's the reporter ? " he asked . " Gone , " said she in a flat voice and with no special expression . " My husband is downstairs eating . He missed lunch and  --  " " All right , " Tierney broke in as if he were questioning a suspect given to ungermane ramblings . " Are you allowed to have a drink ? " " No , " Tierney said . " Get your coat . " Betty carried out the order , brought the garment into the living room and struggled girlishly to thread her arms through the sleeves , with Tierney maintaining his obdurate stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the otherwiseunoccupied restaurant in which Arthur partook of an extraordinarily late lunch or early dinner . Tierney could see him through glass doors , raising a fork laden with somethingsoft and white , a mess of the melted cheese and cream with which that sort of place habitually masked honest meat . Actually Arthur was eating mashed potatoes : he shared Tierney 's distaste for luxury ; had sent away the unctuous wine steward and drank ice water . He failed to see the departure of his wife and the policeman , of which , however , he had received foreknowledge from Betty . The afternoon whiteness had turned dirty above and underfoot , the guttered snow crusting with intermixed filth , though not so durably as to bear weight , as Betty discoveredwhen she waded to Tierney 's automobile . Betty observed nothing coplike in the car except the two-way radio and a certain metallic odor . Tierney drove east and then south , and when Betty first registered their situation she saw the familiar block , and then the very house in which her kin had lately been done to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbed by the recognition , but this she forgot as Tierney ground the car in hub-deep at the left curb , next to a fireplug , and got himself onto the sidewalk , leaving her again with the unpleasant pedestrian chore . Owing to the inclement weather , the cop on house-guard no longer stood before the door ; he sat , with a colleague , in a police car parked just ahead of Tierney 's . Tierney exchangednods with them . He had keys to the doors of house and apartment , went first through both , and not until Betty was well through the latter , stood in the known living roomp133the carpet of which showed a fresh-washed area , a blond pool amid dirty beige , marking where the boarder had bled his last , did Tierney look at her . And when he did , it was queer . Queer to be here at all , queer to notice that the capricious heating system had for once overreacted to the challenge of the outside weather . It was rotten hot , tropical , breathdenying , and dim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tierney said , queerly it seemed to Betty because of the spite in his voice , " I want you to look around carefully and see if anything 's missing or out of place . I know you did that once , but I want you to do it again . " Betty at last understood what was queer about the place : its irrelevancy , her absolute lack of association with it . Their coming here now was an exercise in fantasy : pretend familiarity , pretend you care , when the real thing is melting snow in your boots , wet fabric at the instep , a nasty , crawling clingyness . Betty loathed being damp in any particular : it was as if one had been flayed and reinserted in the reversed skin . She shivered . Interpreting this manifestation as evidence that she was moved by a poignancy of place , Tierney became less spiteful : she was not , then , as callous as he had supposed ; she was capable of sorrowful recollection , of family loyalty , had not sold out . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal motive , to rub her nose in it . He felt shame because it had been unprofessional : he had nothing more to learn from the physical disposition of the apartment . His job was to find Detweiler . Yet he malingered in this living room , which was dull and characterlesslike all scenes of murder when the humanity hadp134been removed . Ghosts never walk where life has been taken illegally : the cop 's superstition . He gave her a kind glance . To which she crinkled her nose and whined , an adolescent : " My feet are sopping ! " She stamped them , which worsened the condition , the captivemoisture having no exit . " Can I go and get a towel ? " Taken by surprise , Tierney said rhetorically : " Why not ? " Betty insisted on answering . " Do n't you have to keep it all as is ? " " No , " Tierney said abruptly . " We know what 's here . " He turned away in embarrassment at the personal note . His own feet were also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a thing he would n't want his wife to see , with her obsession about rubbers . She never seemed to worry that he might get shot or knifed in his line of work , having a Catholic girl 's fatalism in that regard , but a cold fell within her area of command , too petty for God yet all the same sometimes lethal . Her Uncle Jack sneezed one day , died a week later . Betty went through the kitchen and along the hall which was dark but to her unspooky . She threw the bathroom switch . No towels hung on the racks : the laboratory men had taken all away . Spares were in the cabinet below the washstand , stacked on the left , well separated from scouringpowder and cellulose sponge . She fetched one , sat on the closed toilet , removed her boots , and having undone the garter clips , peeled off her stockings and hung them over the lip of the tub . Her feet were excessively pink . Tierney appeared in the doorway . He said : " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " These boots , " said she , " have a flannel lining . It 'll take a long while to dry . "  |p135She  rose and went towards him , he backing considerately away , still in his overcoat in the unbearable heat . She had left her coat across a kitchen chair . In the hall , walking barefoot on the worn runner , she approached Billie 's door , stopped there and asked plaintively : " Is this where ? Did she meet him face to face ? " Betty was not thinking of Joe Detweiler at this moment , nor of Billie , but rather constructing an ideal crime , with ideal murderer and victim , ideal violence devoid of pain or even motion , silent . She stepped inside the room . The police had taken away the bedclothes , leaving the striped mattress . Tierney reluctantly moved out of the spill of light from the bathroom . Being decent , he muttered : " That 's it . " " What ? " " About it , " he said , reaching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned and met his eye . He said : " If your boots are dry , we better go on our way . " " Give them a few minutes . " He nodded and retreated to the living room . Betty lowered herself slowly onto the bare bed , taking care her skirt was modestly arranged lest Tierney come back . She was a virtuous woman , unlike her late sister.  |p136AFTER  HIS NAP Detweiler set about finding a doctor . His mother would have been no help in this regard , because she believed all physicians were charlatans and , when ill , a rare situation for her , doctored herself with herb teas , compounds of charcoal and honey , pulverized roots , and the like , and was soon fit . Detweiler himself felt that doctors had their place in the scheme of things for those who needed the services they supplied . Most people if sick beyond a certain degree required someone else . It was the otherness that did the trick : being ill was essentially being lonely . Detweiler walked several miles so as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , had not been raised locally , but he was well aware that someplacepolice were searching for him and had undoubtedlyp137sent his name and description around the country . He did not wish to expose himself publicly in the immediate environsof his mother 's home , on the chance that some busybodywould notice that she and the wanted man had the same surname , and that her son had suddenly turned up . Over lunch he had taken the simple precaution to say : " Mother , I wonder if on this visit you would call me , to my face and when speaking to your friends , something other than Joe ? " " Sure , " answered his mother , gathering up several wedges of a fried round of baloney onto her fork . " How would you like Ernest Blue , ' or Randolph Binocular ' ? " Detweiler laughed his head off . His mother certainly amused him . " What a name ! " he cried . " Where did you get that one ? " " Made it up , " said she . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowedher eyes and nodded wisely . " I 'll take Ernest Blue , " Detweiler said soberly . " And notbe your son but your nephew . O.K. ? " " All right . " His mother was very good at this sort of game and would never slip up , even if awakened suddenly in the middle of the night , until he called it off . She doted on make-believe and novelty . So off he went . The weather had held clear and cold , too cold to snow , as he was assured by two of the several personswith whom he exchanged greetings on the walk : a candy-store proprietor and a policeman . The latter had looked uncomfortable though buttoned up in his greatcoat , and Detweiler expressed sympathy : " You have a chilly job . " The officer quickly inspected him , found no reason forp138action , and amiably made the observation on the unlikelihoodof snow . Before entering the candy shop Detweiler unobtrusively took out a penknife and cut his thumb , wrapped a handkerchiefaround the wound , and went inside . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counter . Detweiler said : " Say , I just cut my hand while sharpening a pencil . It 's not deep , but the knife was kind of rusty . Maybe I ought to see a doctor so I do n't get blood poisoning . This went over big with the man , whose mother , he said , had wanted him to be a doctor . He had not had the brain , patience , or money to go in for med school , but had retainedan inclination towards therapeutic pursuits . " Let 's see the wound , " he cried , hurling himself halfway across the counter . Detweiler had no choice but to unwind the handkerchief and display his bloody thumb . " Not so bad , " said the man . " I 'll take care of it forthwith , " using a consciously comic pomposity of idiom as part of his bedside manner . He insisted that Detweiler come along to the tiny lavatory let into the rear wall , where he cleansed the cut with soap and water , dried it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and finally fought an adhesive bandage free and plastered it around the decommissioned thumb . Thus Detweiler was frustrated in his initial attempt to reach a physician in this town , although he had a valuable experience which was not to be sneezed at . He wandered on throughout the day , mostly by foot , for he had little money and he was also leery of the distractions available on public transport . No doubt by striking up an acquaint/ante with a fellow passenger he could eventually be directedto that person 's family doctor , but he was aware that the operation he sought fell out of the ordinary range , that the doctor might believe him a kind of nut and mention the incident , with raised brow , to the patient who sent him , and the latter might feel ill-used by the anonymous fellow who had once shared his bus seat , truth being the loser . The alternative was to move slowly and carefully , making a long-term friend rather than a transient acquaintance , and then , when one could rely on informed sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that Detweiler could make a true friend only of a member of the opposite sex . With men there was aways an instinctive rivalry , as much , he was ready to admit , on his part as on the other fellow 's . It was the meeting of protuberances , of like configurationsthat would not mesh . As much as he liked most other men , he hated them fundamentally . Betty Starr had been his friend from the moment he took the room . It was she who served him the largest portionof meat at table , who listened intently if he spoke , who offered him first choice of the newspaper . Without announcementshe began to wash and iron his clothes , not part of his deal with Mrs. Starr , and cleaned his room , which was , but she did it with a care no boarder could expect . She had even once left behind a blue cornflower in a crystal bud-vase . There could be no doubt these were marks of special favor , for she was not an agreeable girl in general . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so loudly with Billie that Detweiler , separated from them by two doors and the hallway 's width , had to cover his ears . P140He could not endure the display of violent emotion . It was as if the earth revolved in a blur , growing ever larger , while he stood motionless but dwindled . This terrified him , and if it continued he sobbed in a miniature voice commensuratewith his size . On one such occasion , head buried in a pillow , face down , minuscule , he felt a touch upon his tiny shoulder . " Are you O.K. ? " He turned quickly , instantly magnifying , for only when others engaged in it did violence disturb him , and said , truthfully , " Sure . " Betty stood at the bedside , a sad-sweet moonface . " I thought you were feeling badly . " " And I thought you were , " Detweiler said . " Me ? " She winced as if trying to remember , then shook her head vigorously , hair swinging . He did not want to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a sitting position . " Oh , " Betty said , " you mean our fight . Billie and I are always at one another 's throats . That 's normal . " Detweiler listened carefully . " It is ? " " Really , " Betty assured him . " Do n't you have any brothers or sisters ? " " I do n't think so . " " What 's that mean ? " " I 'm sorry . . . . When I was little I had a baby sister for a while , but she died . What I meant was , I do n't know what it is like to grow up alongside a brother or sister and whether it is usual to quarrel with them . " What a nice girl Betty was , her face so yielding and blurred . He asked : " Do you have any pictures of yourself as a baby ? " P141She joked : " Bare skin on a bearskin ? I do n't know if I am safe , alone in this room with you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly . Alongside the kitchen stove in her highchair , she had clambered up on rubbery feet , reached with infant fingers at the glass coffeemaker from the lower globe of which boilingwater was surging into the upper through the hollow crystal column ; a stimulating event to Detweiler himself , aged seven , who watched from across the room , milkmuglowered . For a breathless moment all water bubbled and danced in the superior sphere , the lower was magically void ; then it would descend , transformed to another liquid , leveling up as black , then brown , then amber . It always had . But this time his sister 's stubby , groping fingers had sent the wondrous progression awry . The topheavy device leaned towards her , soon crashed in a boiling sheet of deadly transparency , beautiful but killing , and scalded her out of life . Detweiler explained : " I believe that life is never destroyedbut transformed . However , I do n't think my sister is living in any kind of heaven and looking down in an anthropomorphic shape . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold such a belief and talked , in seances and dreams , with a host of the deceased . Betty sat delicately upon the foot of the bed , laid her head on a shoulder , and squinted at him , saying : " That 's intriguing . " " But I am convinced that life or energy or spirit exists forever as a sort of current or fluid  --  the trouble is that when you try to express it in words you run into the problems of language . Words have traditions and histories ofp142their own . " Detweiler said , grinning : " So you are talking about something that can not be talked about . Odd , eh ? Paradoxical . " Betty 's eyes narrowed . She asked : " Were you having some sort of fit before ? " She touched his forearm quickly and withdrew . " You do n't mind me prying ? Tell me to go away anytime . " " Why ? " Detweiler meant : about the " fit , " having no memory of such . But Betty took it as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . " Matters of possession made him uneasy . He traveled light so as to escape the despair of ownership , the tyranny of material . He left his seat on the bed that was no more his property than the other : a demonstration of the difficulties you got into when the subject of belonging arose . " I can take a hint , " said Betty , rising too but moving little . " No , " said Detweiler . " You have a lovely apartment . It 's the nicest room I have ever had . I hope I can continue on . I wo n't make a mess . I have given up sculpture , so there wo n't be any clay around to get on the carpet . " " Sculpture ? " Betty said . Detweiler repeated that he no longer practiced the craft , but to no avail ; she kept after him , she loved all manifestationsof the urge to create , and at length , because she was a girl with a woman 's natural sympathy , he finally agreed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his inability to refuse a plea , by his wretched vanity , to commit another crime : to represent life and so to despise the actuality which sat as his model . But Betty was so innocent as to believe she was being celebrated.  | " I 'm thrilled at the prospect , " she said . " And wait until I tell Billie . " " Will you quarrel with her again ? " Detweiler asked in trepidation . " Probably . " She smiled carelessly . Detweiler was amazed : he saw nothing to be lighthearted about in bad feeling . He hated so much to quarrel that , simply to settle the matter , he would try to kill his opponent . Walking the streets of the city , Detweiler summoned up this memory . Of course , such reminiscence was a kind of Realization , but of a low order , being part of his own history , brought back from only a few years before . But in a modest way it suggested what could be done even amid the distractions of a public thoroughfare . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come ; office workers were homeward bound , moving along under clouds of steaming breath . Detweiler had exhausted the day but not himself , in miles of wander . He had not yet come up with a feasible means of locating a doctor , but he did not regard time as a material that could be wasted or expended : it was ever there and he was in it , as a fish is in the water . He dined on , and shared with purple-gray pigeons , a loaf of day-old bread purchased at small expenditure from a bin of stale products in a supermarket . He had seen the lateafternoonsun of winter celebrate the windows of high buildings . He had watched a man change a flat tire on a busy avenue , deftly work the well-oiled jack and spin off the precise wheel-bolts , at the curb opposite a shopwindow exquisite with eggshell china . " Do you want any help ? " he asked the laboring motorist , merely as a courtesy , for he could see the man exerted per/feet control over his devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a natural high temperature of personality and hence immune to cold , working indeed with bare , freckled hands . " Thanks no ! " the man chirped brightly , between the wind-rush of passing vehicles . Obviously it was not the time or place , nor the person , to ask for a doctor . Detweiler had also ambled through an enormous departmentstore . He assumed such a large establishment , dealing with the public , would keep a dispensary , complete with physician , to attend to the customer who fainted or suffered a heart attack or epileptic seizure while on the premises . But , attracted by the acres of colorful merchandise , he roamed throughout as if in a spring meadow , feeding his senses , touching the toecaps of display-shoes , fingering silks , smelling woolens . Never did he pretend intent to purchase , and never was he regarded with anything but consideration by the salespeople . However , he understood that he was in a potentially commercial relation to them . Any attempt to introduce personal particularities would alter the equilibrium . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Were he to simulate sudden illness and be conducted to the house doctor by the salesclerk who at the moment had amiably accepted the statement that he was " only looking " at the neckties , Detweiler would have established a peculiar identity . " What was wrong with the guy I sent up yesterday ? " the clerk would ask the physician , and perhaps receive an incredibleanswer . Anyway , here was Detweiler , walking along later in theP145evening , past shadowy bars and small hotels . He had recently had a cup of coffee and a doughnut , but their warmth soon leaked off in the intense cold , and his extremitiesfelt brittle as twigs . It took severe conditions to make him uncomfortable , but once in that state he was no masochist : he tried to change it . He now , though not a drinker , stepped into a corner tavern and bathed with pleasure in the heated , though smelly , atmosphere . Contrary to his practice elsewhere , he took a stool as far away from the other customers as could be managed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touchy , and tended to respond perversely to the friendliness which most sober persons were glad to acceptfrom him . A beer was probably the least offensive beverage he could get away with , and he ordered one , thereafter taking an occasional mouthful of its soury chill and ignoring the circumvolution of foam which stayed behind in a sort of bathtub-ring as the level descended . The occupants of the nearest stools were two elderly men who muttered towards , but did not look at , each other . Then in louder tones the one on the left reviled the man on the right , in unspeakably foul epithets , his ancient , transparent ears quivering under a hatbrim stiff with dried rain . An old speckled fist trembled under an old purple nose . The men wore like overcoats , black , heavy , and both hung similar pairs of cracked shoes , with diagonaled heels , from the lowest rung of the stools . There you had the sort of inebriate situation that Detweilerwas always at pains to avoid . In haste he signaled the bartender to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money and fled , but had only a dollar bill to his name .   " Buy me one ? " said a woman behind his left shoulder , where the bar met the wall . He was startled out of the fear engendered by the old-men 's quarrel ; he had not looked for a human intervention from that locality , where there was scarcely room for a person to stand . But he had underjudged the space . Not only had a woman slipped therein , but a substantial woman and vivid even in the dim barlight . Her face showed up as almost-orange beige ; her hair , done in a big hedge-ball , of the next tone of the spectrum , almost-red orange , her lips vermilion . Detweiler was taken by her appearance . She also smelled sweetly . She looked about forty , with the deluxe figure of that age though hesitatingat the margin of what could be called weightiness : rather , solid ; ample . Detweiler was conscious of a sudden appetite to have sexual knowledge of her : she seemed to exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hard as it was for him to be rude : it was his peculiar torment that , in search of mutilation , he found but another argument in its favor . She said reproachfully : " I was only looking for company . You could just say yes or no . " Detweiler turned back and replied as earnestly as he could , as usual . " It is n't that easy , " he said . " You do n't understand . I would like very much to go to bed with you right now . But it would take me away from my work , you see . " Aw hell , honey . Aw hell , " said this large fruit of a woman , pushing him with her hip , from which he assumed she wanted the stool , so he slid over to the next one and was thereby closer to the old men and their **25;8421;TOOLONG . He was now under greater pressure than before , but felt less desperation : such was the effect on him of comfortable women . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flagrantly against the stool he had vacated . " Who 're you ? " " Joe , " he replied , and put out his hand . She accepted it and tickled the palm . Seriously he asked her : " Is n't that a funny handshake ? " " It 's supposed to be sexy , dear . Did n't you do that when you were a kid ? " " Never . " " Did n't you play show me yours and I 'll show you mine ' ? " She shook all of hers in robust merriment . Detweiler had spent most of his childhood by himself . If he approached other children he was extremely cautious : they often kicked , punched , and bit , girls as well as boys . It was true that a little girl had once proposed such an exchangeand , when he asked for clarification , explained : " The secret thing . " So Detweiler reached into his jacket pocket and brought out to deposit on the grass the coil of his garter snake , a beautiful , gentle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peep out the vee of the shirt . The girl screamed and ran away to fetch a brother bigger than either Detweiler or she . Before Detweiler could ascertain his intent this lad had pounded the snake into a writhing foam . The memory made Detweiler feel awful , but it served to water down his lust . It also revived his painful awareness of the quarrel beyond his right shoulder : the furious old man was now threatening to disembowel the other with the point of his shoe . Detweiler began to gulp air into the back of his throat.  | " Wo n't talk , hey ? " said the woman with the red-gold hair . " Playing it safe . " She mounted the seat , put her left elbow onto the bar and her right hand , large and strong , into the descent of his lap and massaged him there . His attention returned to her . For the first time he appreciatedthat she was drunk , much of her high color taking its source in that condition , though her speech had clarity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did play that game once , and it ended badly . " An image of a coconut came to him briefly : the boy 's cropped head , which he had cracked with the baseball bat that killed his snake . The boy collapsed , weeping and bleeding  --  Detweiler was too small to have killed him  --  and the little sister looked at the snake 's remains , looked at her brother , threw her dress up and her drawers down , and said : " O.K. , here it is . . . . Now I bettergo get him some iodine . " The woman 's hand persisted , as if she were diligently sifting sand in search of a lost gem . Detweiler said in regret , referring to the dollar bill which the bartender had not yet taken : " I ca n't pay you anything . This is all the money I got to my name . " At once her hand flew away . " You shit , " she cried . " What do you  --  Who do you  --  Are you calling me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer . " You little fart , " said the woman . " My husband will destroyyou . " She snatched his glass away and took a prodigiousdraught . Something struck Detweiler on the shoulder . It felt like a loosely wadded piece of newspaper , no bulk but thrown hard . The one old man had finally assaulted the other , hurling him against Detweiler . Detweiler left the stool , left the woman , left his last dol/lar . Before he reached the door , however , a man of about his own size though thinner , dark , saturnine , even sicklookingaround the green-ringed eyes and pinched nose , stepped into his path and struck him in the mouth . It smarted rather than hurt . Detweiler covered up with crossed arms . His assailant continued to flail away . From the utterances shouted simultaneously , Detweiler gathered his attacker was the woman 's husband . He doubted that the man was in a state to listen to an oral self-defense , so he said nothing . Nor did he fight back : having naught to fight for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man labored under a misapprehension , no resentment . He certainly was not being hurt by the ineffectual blows against his forearms . At last the assailant lowered his fists and , gasping from the exertion , said : " Will you apologize ? " Detweiler wondered where the husband had been while his wife stood at the bar . It was an odd situation . But he saw no reason why he should withhold that which this gallantindividual sought so ardently . " Of course , " he said . And the man seized his hand , saying : " No hard feelings ? " Detweiler shook his smiling head , though his upper lip , where he had been struck before he put up his guard , had now begun to ache . " I 'll buy you one , " said the other . He retained Detweiler 's hand and with it pulled him to a table in the front corner of the room . " I have to sit down . I 'm not well . Tubercular . " Hopefully , Detweiler asked : " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disappoint him : " Not me . Oh , I tried them , went to hundreds , but they 're all crooks andp150quacks and phonies , taking money unearned by the production of results . You ca n't get away with that in any other line of work . Be in jail if you tried . " He chewed a mottled lip with yellow teeth , giving off an odor similar to that of the stale bread on which Detweiler had dined . " My real trouble , " the husband went on , " is my temper . It drains my strength . I did n't have no quarrel with you just now . I saw her handle you . I got the right picture , but a man has n't any call to strike a woman , correct me if I 'm wrong ? But pride , my friend , you have got to serve pride and decency everywhere . What 's your line ? " " Taxidermy , " Detweiler said , " preserving animals . " " I know what that is exactly , " the husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em ! I used to be a rabbit hunter . Kill one and you should gut him on the spot , rip up from asshole to breastbone , take him by the two front legs , bend over and whip him between your legs and out fly the guts . I 'm going to like you . What 's your name ? " " Joe . " " Walt here . What 's your pleasure in the drinking line ? I myself am beer all the way . " He put a bony finger towardsDetweiler 's lip . " I connected there , Jesus , did I connect . Puffy , and also cut . Must have been this ring : cheap but cute . " He showed Detweiler a death's-head on his knuckle , polished brass with red-glass eyes . " Serves to remind you nothing will last forever , not Mr. Money nor Mrs. Cunt , nobody and nothing . I find it healthy . " Detweiler flinched at the dirty words . He found this personunrewarding , but he did not know how he could get away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p151Then  the wife appeared and put a half-filled glass of beer before him . " You forgot this , " she said , grimacing neutrally . She decorously sat down at the table , across from him . Walt told her : " You had too much . " " All right , " said she . " Well , " Walt informed Detweiler , " you got your beer . Drink up . " He poured himself a glassful from a bottle that had apparently just been opened , it being yet misted with cold . He seemed to be turning disagreeable once more . He said , with a melancholy stare into the middle murk of the room , " Oh , I got my principles , but what have I ever got for them ? " It occurred to Detweiler to ask : " What do you want ? " " Look at those two old killers , " said Mrs. Walt , nodding her orange cocoon towards the ancient combatants at the bar , one of whom was still pushing the other , who accepted it doggedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were now afoot , but had not moved far . The bartender stayed distant , deftly rinsing glasses . He had not collected Detweiler 's dollar . Walt answered gravely , meeting Detweiler 's eye : " The impossible . My youth . " " In my opinion , " said Detweiler , " if you do n't mind me saying so , impossible ' is not the right word , but rather irrelevant . ' Time can only get to you if you let it . Do n't you sense that whatever your body is or does , and your mind too , for that matter , you , the essential you , stays the same ? Did you ever hear of an old soul or a young one ? " Walt looked from Detweiler to his wife and back . " I 'm using the word soul ' because it 's convenient , " Detweilerexplained . " What I mean is a sort of energy of aware-P152ness , a definite conviction that you exist . Do you feel that you exist any less than when you were younger ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groin , into which , across and under the table , Mrs. Walt had insinuated her stockinged foot . She had apparently slipped her shoe off . Walt stared disagreeably at Detweiler 's right earlobe and corrugated his own upper lip . " Well , " Detweiler asked heartily , " are we here or not ? You can begin basically . Where is your youth ? Where is your old age ? One was once here and the other will come . But where are they now ? Where do they come from and where do they go ? No place . But you are always here , right ? Where is here ? Wherever you are : that 's how you tell . It 's certainly not no-place . And if you are here , then it must be worthwhile . " Walt shifted his eyes to Detweiler 's chin and mumbled sourly . Undeterred , Detweiler said : " So youth and age are not things to be taken seriously . They are not to be gained or lost , except in a mechanical way : Einstein says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how can it be im-portant ? " Mrs. Walt suddenly wiggled her toes vigorously . He pulled his chair back several inches and her foot fell audibly to the floor . Walt crowed in triumph , spearing with forked fingers an imaginary olive from the air between him and Detweiler . " If you say it do n't all go up in shit when you die , you are a dirty liar . " Detweiler reflected that it had been an error to get in/volved in a consideration of Walt 's dead-end mystique . This was the kind of wasteful distraction he could avoid were he to find a surgeon to stem the leakage of vital force . There would then be nothing for Mrs. Walt to probe towards , she who , in maximum stretch was now sitting on the small of her back , red head hooked onto the top of the chair , scarcely above table level . She looked like a midget from Detweiler 's perspective . He could feel her toes once more . He could also sense , and even see from the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more like a growth than a pain . " You 're a rumdum slob , " Walt said ferociously and left the table , in a limp that Detweiler had not hitherto noticed . He took two steps and then returned and without warning hit Detweiler in the right eye . Detweiler of course closed it and caged it in his fingers , and watched from the good one Mrs. Walt squeeze wincingly into her shoe and follow Walt to the door , through which , both waving goodbye to the bartender , they exited . Soon thereafter the aggressor of the two old men hit the other with a beer bottle . Without examining the fallen , the bartender got a dime from the till , entered the public telephone booth next to a door marked " Toilet , " and placed a call . Detweiler watched the proceedings through his good eye , serenely . He no longer found the violence infectious . He was still sitting there when the police arrived , two of them , large men in blue . They burst in as if propelled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselvesquickly and stared at the recumbent old-timer whose head lay in blood . He who had committed the assault raved through a toothless mouth , to them but more to the worldp154at large , that the victim had made indecent advances to him , which was a crime . The police took him away . He announcedhe would go " under protest , " and showed as much by his indignant , foot-slapping march . Detweiler sometimes felt sorry for other people ; so much of life seemed loathsome to them . He waited until the ambulancecame for the old man who had been wounded or killed , and after the accompanying interne , dressed in soiled ducks , had sent the victim out upon a litter borne by attendantsin impeccable whites , Detweiler waylaid the doctor , displaying his puffed lip and sore eye . He said , craftily : " May I come along and get treatment ? " " Put cold compresses on those and get some rest , " the interneanswered and departed . Detweiler 's dollar lay yet where he had left it , anchored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commotionof the battle . He waved it at the bartender . Who , back at his glass-washing sink , called pleasantly : " Walt took care of that . " " But I had my beer before I met him , " Detweiler stated . " No , he caught it . " The other persons at the bar showed no curiosity about this exchange . Detweiler , however , found it remarkable . Had Walt , then , directed Mrs. Walt to make his acquaintance ? And if so , why ? In generosity or meanness ? To whom ? As always Detweiler had had an interesting day . When he arrived at his mother 's apartment , standing in the interiorhall he could hear her speaking in falsetto behind the closed door of the living room . She was holding a seance . From the hatrack hung the outer garments of her co-participants , the deceased loved ones of whom wouldp155speak through her if she made successful contact . They would all be holding hands so as to make a human circuit . What they were after was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detweiler , who repaired to the kitchen and ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich . He then went to bed and fell asleep while pulling the blanket towardshis chin.  |p156TIERNEY  DARKENED the doorway . Betty said : " I thought of something else in connection with Joe Detweiler . He once gave Billie a mounted squirrel . It stood on the dresser the last time I was in here before the murders . " She wanted encouragement , but Tierney seemed strangely indifferent , saying merely that he would go over the inventory : perhaps the technicians had taken it to the lab . He admitted he had not seen it . He asked : " Are you ready to go ? " Betty preceded him into the hall , and he waited until she had turned through the kitchen door before he extinguishedthe bathroom light . She lingered at the stove , where on entry he could have collided with her , but his reflexes were astonishing . The illumination rippled smoothly across the linoleum from a floor lamp in the living room beyond.  | " You 're sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered literally . " But you will get him . " Tierney shrugged , a movement she more heard than saw . Betty said : " You have guns and radios and labs and the power to take away somebody 's freedom for parking next to a fireplug . Joe is one man , or boy really , skinny little fellowand soft in the head . He might not even know you 're looking for him : I do n't think he ever reads the papers . He would n't have the faintest idea where or how to hide out . " She was ready now to go on into the living room , but Tierney , it seemed to her , was reluctant to move . Or to speak . His physical effect was bulky in the half light : he still wore his overcoat . The slick chill of the linoleum reminded her she was barefoot . " My boots and stockings . " " I dried them out , " said Tierney . Betty wandered from the kitchen into the light and saw her boots standing erect on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows . She crossed the pale area of carpet where Appleton had died . " Where are my stockings ? " " Here . " Tierney took them from the pocket of his overcoat . It seemed odder to her that he surrendered them with no embarrassment , than that he had carried them so . He next denied her the opportunity to ask him to turn aside while she put them on : ostentatiously he retired to a far corner , stooped , gathering the skirts of his coat , and peered at the baseboard . She was shod when he returned . " Find something ? "  | " Old scar , varnished over , " said he . " Caught the light . " " These old apartments , " she stated . Tierney helped her into her coat , though not considerately , holding it too high . She went up on her toes . " You must have a tall wife . " " No , " Tierney said obtusely . " She is about your size . " " And blonde , " Betty guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to him while she fastened the three big wooden buttons . He made no answer . She turned and said : " I 'm trying to regard you as a person . " Tierney raised the obscure brows over his clear blue eyes . He had a facility for maintaining himself in a neutral equilibriumwhile others moved futilely and aged . He smiled without amusement . " Brunette . " " And detectives always have children . " " Just like people . " Tierney knew as he said it that he had now willfully disarmed himself . He had as much self-pity as the next man , was underpaid and overworked , unloved and mistrusted by everybody and respected only by criminals , yet never before had he found it necessary to snivel to a woman . Quick to seize her advantage , Betty yet spoke slowly and as if in discomfort : " Well , I did n't mean that , and you know it . " She was now in a position from which she could taunt him endlessly . In a merciless calling , he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . She looked at his right ear , which lay efficiently close against his head : he was built for action . She put her hands against the several layers of clothing between the air and his hard chest , and groped . " Leave your gun at home ? "  |p159Boyishly  he opened his coat and jacket and displayed the little clip-holster at the turn of his left hip . As he reached for it he caught her hand , but held it flabbily : she squeezed through and clasped the butt once , then withdrew . She said , grinning : " I thought about it for a long time , and did it . " He considered her eyes for a moment and then laboriouslyunfastened the strap and removed the pistol , opened the cylinder , ejected the shells , and presented the weapon to her . Now Betty kept her hands to herself , saying : " Actually , I 've always been afraid of guns . " " Go ahead , " Tierney said , swaggering somewhat . " It 's unloaded . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man 's device in extremis , nothing in it for doubt or wonder , utterly predictable . " The way to get over a fear of something , " he sententiously went on , " is to know it . A firearmis just an instrument , with no power in itself . " He demonstratedthe technique of cocking and firing , but with a thumb restrained the hammer so the trigger would not snap against space ; which was bad for the firing pin . He dropped a bullet , bent to fetch it , saying : " We have to pay for these ourselves . " Again the note of self-pity . The shell bounced to rest between Betty 's feet . She refused to move as Tierney knelt there . He tapped her boot as a signal she should shift it . The doorbell rang then . Tierney let the shell go and leaped erect , stowing away his revolver in one neat motion . But before he answered the summons he did a strange thing : pushed Betty at the couch , made it clear she should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs by the ankles , swung them up and on.  |p160Then  he went into the hallway and admitted a patrolman through the street door . The cop said : " I am going for coffee . You folks want any ? " " Oh , " said Tierney . " Well , we 're leaving soon . I do n't guess so . " The officer 's chill-flushed face nodded between his cap and high-button collar . " Thanks , Minelli . " Tierney instantly remembered he had got Spinelli 's name wrong , an unprecedented mistake ; he had known the man for several years . No fitting apology occurred to him , so he asked : " Shuster has n't been looking for me on the radio ? " " You 'll know it if he does , " Spinelli said as he left . Tierney called after him , at the closing door , in the empty hall under the yellow ceiling fixture : " Mrs. Bayson is resting . She does n't feel well . " Betty of course could hear this . He must go now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which was not obvious to him . She was waiting , but oddly enough showed none of the ugly triumph he expected , appeared instead as sweet and shy . She had taken off her coat and sat demurely on the couch , hair back of one ear . The bullet rested where it had been dropped . He intended to get it , was on the way , but she put out both arms . He knelt before her , and her legs opened to admit him in his overcoat . He had a sense only of clothing , wadded wool of his and her various nonfrictional stuffs . She avoided his mouth . Her hand once reached his groin as if by accident , drawing quickly away thereafter . Had he ceased to struggle , they would have been lying there in a heap , as though in the aftermath of an accidental collision . He triedp161then to pull away ; even now he was not of a single mind . But she had been working unobtrusively at his belt buckle , and the zipper , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bare . She remained fully dressed , her skirt no higher than the lower garter clips . He alone was indecent , exposed , in violation of the ordinances , and firmly she took him into custody . Betty had been thirteen when Billie had told her : " Get hold of it and you can do anything with them . " Billie was fifteen and Betty assumed she was merely being dirty , theoretical , speculative . Billie in those days talked of much that she did not do : brushing cornstarch into the pubic hair to give it sheen , firming the breasts with egg-white massages , various self-manipulations as training for the control of passionand the increase of pleasure , how to belly-rub a boy hard while dancing or brush him with a knocker at the drinking fountain . In practice , to Betty 's observation , which was close , Billie realized none of these projects . She was actually very modest with boys ; and as to her body , treated it as an athlete 's , showering and exercising daily , and walking on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension and her buttocks under strict management . She neither smoked nor drank and could not suffer the company of those who did . The boys who frequented her had like interests , were gymnasts and weightlifters , with guileless eyes and short hair . Billie in fact remained a virgin throughout high school . Having always believed that wrongdoing took conscious effort , Tierney was delighted to find himself now relieved of moral weight . He had a pleasant sense that time had stopped , that his capacities were therefore infinite . In apprehendingthe malefactor , the police take responsibility forp162his crimes : he who is powerless can no longer be evil . He was not troubled that Betty wished him ill . He was happily married and in no need of comfort . Betty began to tire but not to weaken . Here in her house she would give all and take nothing . Having caused Tierneyto secrete his venom , she would drain it . Her concern was that he not interpret her intent as loving . All at once Tierney took charge . He was finally no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pants , like a spring or rubber band , and made gliding entry , constrictingas though through a ring , expanding thereafter in yielding yet close imprisonment : he could go anywhere but not unaccompanied . She would even follow him out , as retiring from one statement he prepared the next . His wife lay inert , whores drily thrusted : Tierney had not known of a third style , and was momentarily appalled . Yet the fleshly argument was overwhelming . Betty recognized in horror that her treasonous body was making love with his , engrossing , devouring that which it could never retain , breaking its heart , though morally she had vanquished him : proof there was no justice in creation . And now Tierney had claimed her mouth and she was gulpinghis , and his hands had penetrated her clothing , defiling her everywhere as he could not have done were she stark naked . She was in the most calamitous , obscene disorder , and he was her master . It was as if she were acting as accessory to her own murder . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed himself off her and retracted his trousers . It was an extraordinary moment for Betty : she was still enthralled . He closed his coat , and was whole . This seemedp163to take no more time than if he had not touched her . He vanished into the hallway . She kept nothing of him . Tierney was still open under the coat , trousers clipped at the top , but the fly gaped and his belt buckle dangled , and he knew from the absence of a certain weight that his gun had slipped from the holster he had not restrapped . Nevertheless , it was with a sense of self-possession that he again opened the street door to find Spinelli . The officer exhaled a burst of steam . He looked as though he had run up the stoop . " That was Shuster , " he said , referring to the police radio . Cold wind blew up Tierney 's overcoat and toyed intimately with him . He received the subsequent message without comment on it , but asked Spinelli to call in that he was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't ever tell with a psycho , huh ? " He erected , and gestured with , a gloved thumb . " The lady O.K. now ? " Tierney nodded heavily . He reflected that he must be smeared with lipstick and wondered why Spinelli failed to notice . But Spinelli continued jovially : " Too bad the prick did n't come in in Florida . " He steamed again and thudded his hands against his heavy blue coat . Tierney laughed in a kind of wheeze and closed the door . Betty was precisely where , and as , he had left her , with one exception . She held his pistol . Oddly enough , throughout the interruption he had maintained himself , or was maintained , in a state in which he could have returned and finished with her , and so preserve the order of things . Now his blood receded swiftly . A firearm was mostp164deadly in the hands of the unpracticed . Any policeman would rather face a veteran gunman than an amateur . He had begun to stalk her when she said , wistfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon beside her on the couch . Her lipstick seemed intact : therefore he must not have been defaced . He had got away with it , probably ; could not recall any irony in Spinelli 's manner . He strapped the .38 into the holster . It had been a close call , all around , but he had emerged without damage . With his back to her he fastened his fly . Then he turned and told her that , and where , Joseph Detweilerhad given himself up . Betty gasped . Tierney was touched . He wanted to help her from the couch , or something , but was certain she would reject any offer . So he just stood there and tried to smile . He said : " I have to go along now . " " Poor Joe , " said Betty . " Will you hurt him ? " She seemed genuinely worried . Tierney believed this was the first evidence he had ever seen in her of authentic emotion . Perhaps it was not that she never had such , but rather that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detective of facts and not suppositions ; else he was doing a job other than that for which he had been hired . No one would pay a nickel for him as a person , at the mercy of normal human weaknesses . He worked on call , like a device ; and like a mechanismhe did not understand regret . " I wo n't have responsibility for him , " he said , with some amazement at her plea . She searched his face . " He might say funny things , but it wo n't be defiance . He looks at things differently than mostP165people . He expects more of people than they do of them-selves . " Tierney found himself oddly embarrassed . He said : " Who does n't ? " " You do n't , " Betty replied with bitterness . Jesus Christ , thought Tierney , so we 're back to that . All the same , he was impressed by her consistency . She was quite a woman . He could fall in love with her if he wished , but it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you are sane , " Betty added . Tierney drove her to the hotel in a slow crosstown passage through rush-hour traffic and snow-wet streets . The curious episode at the apartment had lasted only about ninety minutes . He had gone there to lay her , and succeeded : he decidedthis in retrospect . With Detweiler in custody , Tierney would have no further reason to see Betty . He seemed to suffer no ill effects from coitus interruptus ; he kept his mind off the subject , though maintaining a surveillance on his body . In his profession health was a major concern . Tierney pulled into a snowdrift some distance from the entrance to the hotel . " Would you mind ? " Betty asked derisively . " Would you mind letting me out up where it 's clear ? " They had said nothing on the journey . She went on : " What I have always heard about a cop 's manners is true : they are nonexistent . " Before complying , Tierney took her gloved hand . He said with awkward evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betty had known all along that she could make him fall in love with her . She asked : " What for ? " P166He drove to the main entrance , and the uniformed functionaryopened the door . As Betty swung her boots out , Tierney said softly but distinctly : " Ah , to hell with you . " P167DETWEILER GOT out of bed and saw a white angle across the sash of the window . The snow had followed him cross country . He turned his back to it as he performed his exercises . He squatted , spread one hand against the floor between his knees , and lifting himself upon it , legs drawn up , sat like a frog upon a toadstool . This took strength and more than strength , balance , and more than either , will . Usually when in this position he meditated on that which was inexpressible , his faculties in suspension . There were yogis who claimed that in its ultimate refinement the exercisecould be done without the supporting hand , but Detweilerdid not believe such was possible except by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceived himself into thinking he sat on air . For the physical laws were absolute , made sense . The earth was a magnet that attracted anything which had weight . It was a marvelous principle , P068and Detweiler had no interest in trying to defy it . He was no enemy of the natural . Today , various practical considerations addressed him as he aligned his forces along that rigid arm growing from the rootlike fingers . Perhaps he would not succeed in getting himself mutilated . Certainly his efforts of the day before had been fruitless . He knew he tended towards the idealistic . What he really wanted was for a doctor to seek him out , to suggest the operation as if it were a surprise : " Say , I specializein amputations . Sell you one ? " Casual , breezy , but not vulgar . Detweiler could then accept tentatively , as if it were not of enormous importance to him ; or maybe initially resist , ask for a prediction of the advantages thereof . " Come on , " the doc would say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain began to insinuate itself through the tendons of his wrist . This was not right : his breathing must be off . That snow was getting to him . It was certainly distracting to think of the mess he had left behind . Detweilerbegan to lose confidence in the arm on which he was supported ; his body started to sway as if atop a high pole in a breeze . There was this to say about concealment : it led to misconceptions . Suppose a man performed an act which had another appearance than the one intended , or perhaps its significance was that it had no significance : driving to an urgent appointment , he ran down and killed a pedestrian , but kept on going because he was already late . Thus he became a criminal in the eyes of the law , though he had had nothing to gain from destroying the victim and , in fact , no interest in him . Indeed , he could have remained wholly legal if he had only stopped and displayed some concern for the fallen . His crime was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead , whatever the driver did subsequently would be relevant only in a social way , only to satisfy the Law . There were reasons why the Law had to be absolute and not allow for exceptions . Otherwise it would be preposterous to punish a motorist for not stopping to minister to a man well dead . There was knocking upon the door of his room . Detweiler said , " Come in , " and his mother did . He performed a headstandand , seeing her upside down , said : " Good morning . " " Good morning , Ernest , " replied his mother . " Did you sleep well ? " " As a matter of fact , I did . But I got up on the wrong side of the bed . I 'm trying to figure out something about the Law , at the moment . " " Of course I ca n't see you properly in that position , " said Mrs. Detweiler , " but your nose looks swollen and your one eye seems to be black . I wonder if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detweiler answered , " a drunken man hit me twice last night . In the mood he was in he had to hit somebody , so it was just as well it was me rather than someone who would have been hurt . " " And you 're feeding the areas with a fresh flow of blood now , " said his mother . " I suppose I am , but not intentionally . I 'm really thinking about the Law , as I said . " " Manmade or natural ? " " Their connection , if any . " " How so ? " " I was wondering whether I ought to go and report something I did that was against the Law . " " Report to whom , Ernest ? "  | " The police , " said Detweiler. " : do n't imagine anyone else would be interested . But the police are probably puzzled about it , and they work pretty darn hard . It makes me feel lousy to keep them in suspense , taking up their time with a problem I could very easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off ? " asked his mother . " The police always have lots of work . Any job you take off their hands will be replaced with another . It reminds me of that time you worked as a postal clerk , sorting mail . You would dispose of a great stack of letters , all in the proper pigeonholes , and it was a real satisfying feeling to have everythingmanaged so nicely , but then , you remember ? , a fellowwould wheel up a cart and line up another three hundred letters in front of you . Took away your incentive , you said . At the end of your shift there remained as much mail as at the start , and it would go on so forth throughout the night , and no doubt unto this very day . " " Yes , " said Detweiler . " But if one letter went astray it would mean something to the person who mailed it . That I am sure of . Just because there are a lot of people in existencedoes not lessen the value of particulars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 'll remember in a minute . I had a reason for doing it , and so the whole thing was canceled out . You know how you will add up how much money you owe and then match it against what you have , pay the bill , and then forget the specific figures ? " " Sure , " she said . " I 've never had a head for figures . Which is why I could n't ever be a numerologist , though having known some lovely people in that field . The great composer Johann Sebastian Bach would n't take a step , could n't writep171a note without determining its numerological significance . I reached him once , asking for help with a numerical situation in which a friend was involved , but for the most natural reason it came to nothing . " " He spoke in German , " said Detweiler , from under his chest . " Exactly . " " I hope you had a good seance last night , " Detweiler said . His mother answered : " We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubters want blowing winds and floating trumpets and the claptrap . They are dumbfoundedwhen you tell them that matter obeys its own laws , and so with the spirit ; sometimes the two are combined , as in human and animal life , contained in physical bodies but animated by spirit . But the purely physical does not have a life of its own , and no spiritualist ever claims it does . " " I disagree with you there , Mother , I must say . I think if you kick a table leg the table feels it . " " All right , Ernest , that is its nature . But a table wo n't ever fly . " Detweiler let himself down and lay on his back . " I was just thinking , in connection with calling you ' Ernest ' , " said his mother . " If you keep calling me Mother , ' anybody would know you were my son no matter what I call you , would n't they ? " " Oh yeah , " Detweiler replied , snapping his fingers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am at an age where you get addressed as mother by total strangers , " said Mrs. Detweiler . Detweiler began to laugh . He said : " I ca n't keep it up , this false-identity stuff . You do n't have to pretend any more.  |p172Guess  I would n't have made much of an actor . But you really keep the professional touch . " The reference was to Mrs. Detweiler 's early days as partnerin a mental act with Detweiler 's father . They played little clubs , theaters , county fairs , trade conventions , his fatherin a turban out among the audience , his mother blindfoldedupon the stage . They were supposed to work by means of a code : in Mr. Detweiler 's phrasing was the clue to the object he asked her to identify . " What have I here ? " perhaps signified a gentleman 's watch . " Can you tell me what this is ? " a lady 's comb . And so on for two dozen commonarticles found in pockets and purses . Rarer items were dealt with by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact Mrs. Detweiler never learned even the simple phase of the code ; she had no head for that type of symbolism . And no need for it , being naturally able to see through faculties other than the physiological eye . Thus when her husband was not able discreetly to ignore some member of the audience who handed him a small jar of calf's-foot jelly ; said : " Well , well , ah yes , " the signal for the institution of the difficult code ; and began to spell " jam " with the first letter of the first word in the first sentence , the second letter of the second word , etc . ( " Just a moment , please . My partneris concentrating . She uses memory , introspection , clairvoyance . . . . " ) Mrs. Detweiler did not count efficiently or spell with any conviction . She had tried , though , and would try again , for her husband strongly disapproved of her using techniques other than his . Any suggestion of the supernatural made him furious , and he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a chance on his being so distracted by showmanshipas to overlook her defection from the modes of reason . Calfs ' - foot jelly was a case in point . She got " jam , " but " calf " was taking so long to announce , though her husband was glib , and she soon lost count , and it was foolish anyway to make so arduous what was no task at all : in her mind 's eye she could see very clearly the little jar , excommercialpeanut butter ; the label , hand-lettered in pen and ink ; the paraffin disk that topped off the jelly ; the screw-on lid . She interrupted her husband to make the identification . After the act was finished and they were back in the dressing room , he struck her with the old one-two . Her husband was show-business all the way : he never gave her a beating the effects of which could not be concealed by make-up or costume . He never caused her to limp . Nor did he make a commotion which would wake young Detweiler , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Detweiler did not protest against these well-deserved punishments . When Mr. Detweiler passed on she was free to take up spiritualism . By the time she got through to him he had calmed down . Life in the otherworld was such as to extinguishhigh emotion . All there was serene , truly superior , and beautiful . You could choose your age and remain in it : Mr. Detweiler decided on twelve and wore knickers above high stockings , and a billed cap . He remained an entertainer , amusing the Elysians with sleight-of-hand and jokes , for fun was the rule Over There , where no one worked or needed an income . Of Joseph , he often told her : " We do n't have to worry about him . He 'll make his way . He 's no fool . " But , like herP174husband , Joseph had a temper . He disliked noise , rudeness , and cruelty unless it was the natural type displayed by animals . Mrs. Detweiler could not endure watching a cat stalk a robin , but as quite a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the great circuit of existence . But he half-killed a neighbor boy who plinked at birds with an air rifle . They , Joseph and she , had to leave town . They left many towns , and his formal education had been catch-can , but he seemed to turn out well nevertheless , and philosophicallyhe was developed far beyond the standards of the schooled . He also had this artistic talent from an early age , could make likenesses of anybody in any medium , and was therefore popular though quiet . Mrs. Detweiler found it easy to gather about her a little circle of spiritualists wherever she was : they recognized one another on sight . Nose around a local grocery or bus stop and you would find a kindred soul . This elite was never numerous , but international , of all races and levels of income . The more prosperous communicants provided her rent- and food-money ; give what you can , she levied no charges and used her gift as strenuously for those who had no money to spare . Since Joseph had grown up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in the same place . He had occasionallyvisited her in the years since , without incident . But now he was apparently involved in some difficulty , his nose enlargedand his eye ripe , and she suspected she might have to move soon again . " I had better go pack the suitcase , " she said . Detweiler shook his bruised face . " No , I do n't think that 's necessary , Mother , I really do n't . Nobody knows me here , P175and this trouble may not turn out to be serious . I just wish I could remember . At the moment I just have this sense of something wrong at the back of my head . He might have been deaf . " " Who ? " " This guy . " " The fellow who hit you ? " " No , " Detweiler said . " The fellow I think I killed . " His mother shook her head : too deep for her . Joseph had his own doings . If he wanted to elucidate , he would in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for both of them , went and fried some cornmeal mush and served it with Karo syrup , and Detweiler spooned up most and then , scraping his fork across the plate , collected the sweet film between the tines and licked them clean . What had previously been inchoate now fell into place . Detweiler shaved himself again though he had done so only yesterday and his beard was very light , and put on a necktie and a suit of his father 's that his mother had kept for twenty years  --  still in good condition , moth-free , and better than the one he had worn on the trip out . The pants were somewhat large but supported by suspenders . Detweiler had been fond of his father but never missed him . He had not seen it as a pity that his father had done away with himself , given his rationale . His father had always lusted to make it big in the entertainment profession : next season , next year ; he had been a slave of time . But the intervals of experience measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy Detweiler had been amazed by the people who had no sense of reality , who rejected the here and now in the quest for the other , like the boys who wanted to " be "  |p176something  when they grew up . With the same idea , his fatherwanted to " be " a headliner , as if that were a type of existence which differed altogether from the kind in which he presently lived . To Detweiler this was an extraordinary misapprehension , especially in view of the fact that an entertainer 's audience had no face at all , and his father had a thorough disregard of even the identities of its individual members as he circulatedamong them and chose their personal possessions for use in his act , held up a comb with no acknowledgment of the living hair through which its teeth had swept . Detweiler 's father had therefore hanged himself . It had been Detweiler , who was seven , who found him : like a side of meat or a big hunch of bananas , leaving no note . The ' Disc en @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Colo . The immediate cause , Mr. Detweiler 's chagrin that he could not afford the inexpensive suite the Detweilers had occupiedthe last time an engagement brought them to Denver . This occurred on a day in late summer , warm in town , but if you looked across into the western distances , the vast reaches , the mounting , aspiring thrusts , you saw the first cap of snow on the Rockies . In his father 's suit Detweiler sat down now on the narrow bed and began to Realize the experiences of a party of westwardemigrants lashing their ox-pulled covered wagons up the slopes , winter on its way , biscuit and water running low , no game sighted in days , but ahead the awesome echoes , the blue and white infinity , a high-wheeling eagle : grand , splendid , unconditioned . But Detweiler did not like the wagonmaster 's curses , though he loved his blue-ginghamed daughter with her cornsilk hair.  |p177Today  was blue for Detweiler . When he had put aside his Realization , the falling snow against the window looked blue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; even his shirt had a thin blue stripe . An enchanting color , deriving , like all hues , from the sun : there was an opinion that called it cold : not so , sparks were often blue , and very hot skies . " What else is blue ? " he asked his mother , who was at that moment passing through the hallway . " The false name you selected , " she answered . " Oh yes . " " Joseph , " said she , " it just occurred to me : could I check into the matter for you ? " Detweiler understood the reference and all its implications . She was offering by spiritual means to determine whether the man was dead , the man he had spoken of earlier . " I 'd rather you did not , Mother . I better handle this my-self . " Detweiler put on his coat . His haversack was packed and ready to go . Said his mother : " You certainly look fine in that suit . I was talking to your father yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detweiler neither believed nor disbelieved in his mother 's traffic with the otherworld . He saw no reason why he had to take a definitive position on it . He said : " How is he ? " " Fine . Though of course it is a mistake to think they do n't have problems Over There , little annoyances , difficulties . It is of course Perfect , but not perfect in our sense . And there is one very , very unusual circumstance that the living never think of . "  |p178Detweiler  raised his brows . His mother said : " Over There you can not die to escape your troubles . " Cap in hand , pack on back , Detweiler kissed his mother and said : " Thanks for everything . I 'll send you some money if I get some . " " I know you will . God bless you , Joseph . " She went with him to the door and stood within its frame as he descended the stairway . When he reached the first landing , he stopped and , reflectingthat he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called up : " I really enjoyed breakfast . " She waved and he went down and out into the snow . The receptionist in the lobby of the newspaper building looked suspiciously at Detweiler 's haversack but sympatheticallyat his eyes . He had first asked for the managing editor but then turned his attention to her earrings , saying : " Are n't they pretty ! " Ever on guard against attempts to butter her up , she yet could not believe that his purpose was damaging to her , professionally , economically , sexually . Therefore she identified them as coral . " From the bottom of the sea , " Detweiler said in wonder . " To your ear . " She had a greatly attractive ear , too , pink as a shell . The young woman sensed in herself a tendency to relinquishher spirit to him . Still , she had a job to do . She asked : " Could I request the nature of your business ? Wo n't someone else do ? The managing editor is terribly busy . You understand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need to apologize , but he suddenly gazed into her eyes with profound grace . " Anybody who is aware of events , I guess , would be appropriate . I asked for the editor rather than a reporter because I figured he would be here , working at a desk . Whereas reporters are always out around town , are n't they ? " " Do you have a story ? " the receptionist asked very seriously , for oftentimes unusual people came in off the street with such . In journalism you could not disallow a person on his appearance or manner . Detweiler thought for a moment , and then he nodded soberly . " It well may be . That 's what I have to find out . " The receptionist was all at once too shy to ask him more . She called a city reporter down on the intercom . When the newsman arrived Detweiler asked : " Are you on the Crime Desk ? " " What 's that ? " the man coldly replied , but Detweiler 's face showed a generosity he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Well , I write about crime if it is a story . " He laughed and said : " Have you committed one ? " " I might have . I thought maybe you could check for me . " The reporter sucked back his smile . He suddenly had a feeling about Detweiler and stared plaintively at him : he feared ingenuousness . Detweiler said : " I did n't want to go to the police because they would be annoyed if it turned out not to be a crime . " " They would ? " The reporter found himself at the mercy of this small , odd individual . For one thing he had difficultyP180in assessing Detweiler 's age , seeing him , absurdly , as a kind of adolescent old man . " Oh sure . I do n't want to make fun of the cops , " Detweiler explained . " That is pretty rotten , considering the risks they take to protect us all from violence . I would n't want to turn out to be a crank , like those people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bomb in the so-and-so hotel lobby . ' Then they clear the place and search and it turns out to be not true : the caller 's threat was empty , and he had misused the considerable power of a citizen in this day and age . That could n't be done in the eras before the invention of the telephone . The crank would have had to send a note and then wait until delivery had been made : too long , and he would n't be sure the proper authority had got it . " Detweiler was talking a lot because he had a great sense of well-being from having the ear of a gentleman of the press , a person with the means of vast communication at his fingertips . For himself , Detweiler disapproved of writing . Words were elements of another kind of reality than that which claimed his primary attention . He would have written things if by so doing he could create actual states or situations , if by writing " John is happy , " John would indeedbe rendered happy . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solely to describe . If John was unhappy , it would be a lie . However , writing was a reporter 's business , and Detweilerdid not feel it corrupting to be written about . Indeed , he relished telling his story through another person . Newspapermenalways said what they wished anyway : the guilt would not be on his own head . A clever person could fish out the truth . The main thing was to get it told . For example ,  |p1841there  might be great value in publishing an explanation of why he wanted his penis to be amputated . Perhaps others had the same aim and had been frustrated as he had been . There was no limit to what men , any man , could do . Detweilerwondered whether the reporter had any sense of his own potential . The reporter said , timidly : " Would you like to come up to the city room ? Would you rather talk there ? " He glanced about at the people moving through the lobby , suggesting that Detweiler found them distracting or at least craved privacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where you would feel at ease . " The floor they got off on was the scene of much activity and businesslike clamor : vital machines and talking men . Detweiler nodded here and there , but most people were too involved in newspaper matters to respond . In the center of all this the reporter claimed a desk as his own and got Detweileran extra chair . " Now , " he said , " I do n't know your name . " Detweiler answered expansively : " That is beside the point for the moment . What I had in mind is if you could determine whether recently a man was killed in a lunch counter . " " Where ? " The reporter looked quickly at Detweiler 's hands . It was instinctive , murder being usually a labor of the fingers : on a trigger , a knife , even around a vial of poison . Detweiler 's were small and boyish , even to the scab over a minor cut he might have got from playing mumbletypeg . His eye , however , was black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reporter had of course registeredthat but not noticed it until now.  | " You should see the other guy , huh ? " he essayed to joke , but Detweiler showed polite quizzicality . " Could you find out ? " He was a stubborn little guy , had a moral force to him . The reporter was amused by his arrogance , but nevertheless called the police . " Results nil , " he said as he broke the connection some moments later . " No killings . No luncheonette fights you could fit in have been reported , anyway . Why do n't you just forget about it ? " " I do n't like rudeness , " Detweiler said . " But the countermanI hit might have been deaf , you see ? He might not have heard me . If so , I was wrong . I should have been more patient , maybe . " He winced . " But he did hear me when I ordered coffee , so why not when I asked for sugar dough-nuts ? " The reporter could not understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found himself caught up in it . Detweiler 's earnestness was irresistible . " Hell , " he said , " we all have moments when we are not at the top of our form , but then time passes . " Detweiler regarded this statement with care as a young fellow quietly but rapidly took away some papers from the desk . The place was only superficially in confusion : actually there was a scheme . The newspaper would appear on schedule , assembled , organized from all this movement and noise . It was a marvel of directed energy , that 's what Detweilerliked about it . He had no interest in news in any particular sense , except now to wonder how these purposefulpeople were able to choose from all that happened incessantly , those relatively few items which they felt were worth writing about.  | " Yes , " he said , " it 's not easy to pierce the illusion that Time goes somewhere from which it can not be recovered except in the counterfeit form of history , the representation or reproduction but not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had not really suspected that Detweiler was a nut , for all the apparent evidence of nonconformity in the lad . He was briefly desperate : he should have brushed him off downstairs . But Detweiler was no boor . He knew the man had work to do and was not likely to be in a contemplative mood amid the jangle of a hundred telephones . Therefore he got to his feet and said : " I want to thank you for your kindness . Perhaps we can work together again when I have refined my techniques of Realization . You might be interested if you are a student of Time . Meanwhile , God bless you . " The reporter rose involuntarily , as he did only for men of the cloth . " All right , " he said , " do that . Good luck to you . " He suddenly gave his name , from a motive no more clear than the others of which he had been recent victim . So close did he come to letting Detweiler walk out of there to vanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Glad to have met you , Mr. Allen . I 'm Joseph Detweiler . " The Starr case was national news . Allen kept smiling idioticallyas Detweiler backed politely away for a step or two and then turned to leave . Oh Christ , oh Christ . Allen finally managed to call out in a queer voice : " Let me walk you to the elevator . " He caught up , and with all his heart and soul could barely squeak : " Detweiler . . . know the name . . . from somewhere . "  |p184Detweiler  answered with a sweetness that exceeded belief . " I guess it 's even got out here . The police are looking for me . " " They are ? " Allen felt as though he were floating , experiencedan odd lack of care . He bit his lip so as to get a purchaseon something . " They are ? " he compulsively asked again . " Sure , " Detweiler cheerfully confirmed . " That 's their job . " Allen suddenly remembered his own , losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menace , and transforminghim into a commodity . He said : " Listen , let 's go and see the managing editor . " " Now , is n't that funny , " Detweiler responded , stopping near a desk where a young woman was applying herself furiously to a typewriter . " That 's who I asked to see in the first place . " He looked at the woman and said to Allen : " It 's marvelous how you people can work in all this noise . " Allen said passionately : " You can make a lot of money out of this . " Now it was Detweiler who said : " Pardon ? " " For exclusive rights to your story , " said Allen . " For turningyourself in to us rather than the police . " " Oh , I was n't thinking of doing that . " Detweiler was amused . He had been carrying his haversack and now swung it about as he chuckled . Had that happened before Allen had conceived his idea , the reporter would have seen the pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come on , " he said . " You knew what you were doing when you walked in here . I never took that lunch-counter stuff seriously . " Detweiler was hurt . His lower lip came out . They hadp185continued to walk and were presently at the elevators . He did n't like anyone to believe him dishonest . He said : " Well , I 'm not crazy . What would I get from handing myself over to the police ? " Allen naturally supposed Detweiler was being coy so as to build up his price , and told him that for sums of this nature only the managing editor could negotiate . He pressed the Up button . " Why do you keep talking about money ? " Detweiler asked in annoyance . He saw , despairingly , that the reporter'simpression of him was getting ever more mean . He went along helplessly as the elevator climbed , stopped , and Allen led him hastily past a protesting secretary into a large , handsomeroom full of wooden furniture , bookshelves , and a decisiveman who listened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for so he was , also harped on money . At last Detweiler put up his hands . It was getting too noisy . He said : " With all respect , the only thing you have said that interests me is about the syndication . If I tell my story for you , you can get it published all over the country ? " Of this he received vociferous confirmation from a roomfulof those who should know . The editor had sent out the summons . The publisher himself , and all his executives , were now there and listening to Detweiler . It was pretty nice to have such attention , and though importunate , they were all mannerly . " Well , O.K. , " Detweiler agreed . " Then I 'll do it . Can you get me a lawyer ? " The publisher said : " I 'll get you Melrose . " " Is he good ? "  |p186The  publisher laughed in affirmation , and the managing editor , who had turned paternal , said : " Son , he is the best . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt misunderstood . " Oh , " he said , " if you 're goingto call it murder , I might as well have gone to the police . " The others fell silent , and the managing editor said : " Son , you want to tell us about it ? " " Sure , " said Detweiler and began to talk about Realizationinto the microphone of a recording machine they hooked up for him : it was marvelous to know one 's expression was being preserved indefinitely : in itself , an aid , like photography , to a kind of mechanical Realization . Useful , though not the real thing : only a machine , condemned to the monotonous inanimate circuits , producing not the voice but an electronic imitation . Still , it was a handsome , precisiondevice , and Detweiler enjoyed his association with it . They let him talk on uninterruptedly until a secretary brought in a handful of contracts for him to sign . Having done so , he was about to resume when the managing editor said : " Son , we are paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your philosophy is worth that . We have n't heard you say yet how you will plead . Did you murder those people ? " Detweiler kept control of himself , no easy task , but he understood that attacking this man would only be detrimentalto his aim . He thought again of the possibly deaf counterman . It might be that the editor was deaf , if not physically , then morally : so many people were . Which was why Detweilerhad decided to tell his story through the news medium : everybody read the papers . So he held on , gripping the arms of the leather chair in which he sat.  |p187He  said carefully : " I never murdered anybody in my life . The money means very little to me except insofar as I can use it to further my work . And my sole purpose in talking to you gentlemen of the press is to disseminate knowledge of my work . Realization means not only recovering the past , making it current and thus ending the bondage of Time . It also means realization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to insult you fellows , but have you ever thought of the futility of what you do ? There is another newspaper every single day : all those that have gone before are dead . All you powerful , clever , and wealthy men are slaves to that rhythm . Do you seriously believe that the quality of existence would be changed if you suddenly one day failed to bring out an issue ? Would life stop because you did not write about it ? Or do you write about life at all ? I mean the fundamental kind of life that a snake lives , or a fish in the sea , or a bird . " Can not what you do be seen as a game or even a dream ? Does it matter ? Wo n't there always be another inningeven if any one or all of you have quit ? Your own time runs out , but Time continues . Yet human beings usually fancy themselves as superior to animals . Animals do n't have newspapers or policemen or clocks , that is , unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying that men should or can live like animals . Too much has happened  --  " " Joseph . " It was the publisher who now broke in . Had the editor spoken at that point , Detweiler would probably have tried to eliminate him . He had gripped the chair so tightly that four fingers of each hand had penetrated the leather , broken through into the stuffing . But the publisher was someone new . Also he had promised to get this splendid lawyer Melrose , and Detweiler was counting on that : hep188needed an eloquent advocate to say what he wanted said , before he went to the electric chair . " Joseph , you say you are not a murderer , is that right ? But did you have anything to do with the Starr women and the boarder on Christmas Eve ? Did you see them , did you talk to them ? If not , how did you spend your time that evening ? " Detweiler nodded . " There you have it  --  time ' again . " He shook his head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Then he said : " Oh , I killed them all right . But it was n't murder , because I had nothing to gain . "  |p189THE  LOCAL OFFICERS who came to the paper to take Detweilerinto custody began by squinting hostilely at him and certainly did not shake the hand he offered . There were five of them , two of high rank with extra insignia , and to each Detweiler introduced himself , saying " Joe Detweiler , " and putting his hand out five times . Nobody took it , but the lowest-ranking policeman , a detective in mufti , could not help murmuring something in return : not actually his name , but a pleasant mutter , then glanced fearfully at the leading inspector , who ignored him . The inspector had been instructed by his superiors to register a protest against the publisher 's having kept Detweilerunder wraps for six hours , but once within the paneled office , up to his shins in the moss-green carpet , facingthe self-reliant man who had the ear of millions of readers locally , not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave his own name much as Detweilerhad done to him , though with less assurance . He did not seek to shake hands . The publisher disregarded the police . Instead he was reading the statement that Detweiler had dictated ; trying to , anyway . Trying to see how something readable could be made from it . As it stood it comprised thousands of words of insane rubbish , with no further reference to the homicides after the first sentence : " I killed them , but that is not important . Time is the sole essential . Can we free ourselves from its bondage ? That is the question . Professor Einstein says that time slows down as speed increases , referring to physicalmotion . But what of mental motion ? Can the mind move at a speed that will kill Time ? Can a moment be stopped , suspended , frozen , as light can in a motion-picture projector ; and reversed , relived ? This is worth consideration . . . . " Detweiler was an insane killer . Thus the rules applying to his and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was precedent . The paper had run the memoirs of heads of state and five-star generals : the publisher 's friends , neither homicides nor maniacs . Men of power , like himself only more so ; therefore the publisher neither really liked nor trusted them . Detweiler was actually a powerless nonentity in the usual sense of the term . The publisher felt paternal towards him , if anything ; even fond of this boy , who had yet murdered three persons with his bare hands . Savagery did not frighten the publisher , at least not at his habitual remove from it . He had nothing to fear from Detweiler in a physical way . Yet , though his soul shriveled as the killer talked on hour after hour about Time and Reali/zation and Mind and Will , he was ever more disinclined to interrupt . There was that about an obsession , even a lunatic 's , which commanded respect . Indeed , all successful men were obsessed : the publisher himself , who had begun life as a rich boy but refused to accept the cretinism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's warehouses without privilege , sold want-ads , battered his way to the top while a weaker character might have saunteredthere , the result being that though not every President had kissed his hindquarters , none had kicked them with impunity . Therefore he felt a certain organic affinity with Detweiler , even with Detweiler , crazy killer , who was prepared to die to get his message across . The message , of course , was impossible . Naturally he could not honor his promise to Detweiler to print it as is . Indeed , it was not even accessible to revision . The managing editor had already assigned a deft reporter to prepare a new version . Detweiler would have been extradited by the time the first installment appeared , under close guard . He was , after all , a homicidal maniac , with no rights . The local police were an awfully nice bunch . Detweiler thought that now he had confessed to breaking the law , he would be mistreated , because he knew that cops hated criminals , and he had begun , already in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , impervious to torture . In such a state he could have been beaten for hours without feeling pain or showing a bruise : like a rod made of vanadiumsteel . However , the process of transformation took a lot out of him , annealing his mind as well : he was good for little else than endurance , so ordered . Therefore he was relieved when the plainclothesman dispassionately hookedp192the claw of the handcuffs on his wrist and made it snug through the ratchet , secure but not painful . It actually felt good to Detweiler . The detective himself wore the other manacle ; they were linked in the Law . It was the first time Detweiler had ever had an official connection . Photographers kept taking pictures . " Just one more , Joe . . . . Joe , this way . . . . Inspector , move in close , please . Take him by the arm . " Busy , lively fellows , with winking lights . The publisher at last ordered them off and came to shake his hand . " Good luck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Detweiler . " That lawyer has n't called back yet , has he ? " " Do n't worry , " the publisher said . " A message is at the pier . He 'll get it the moment he steps ashore . " Melrose , the criminal attorney he had promised to get for Detweiler , was fishing for tarpon off Fort Lauderdale . Detweiler said : " I want to thank that reporter , Pat Allen , whose idea this was in the first place . " " He 's back at work . " The publisher laughed . " We have to get a paper out , you know . But I 'll have someone tell him . " Detweiler suddenly twisted himself in pride , jerking the attached detective . " I wish you would tell him yourself . It was his idea . " Now the publisher 's laugh was somewhat hateful . He said : " You have my word . " The police took Detweiler for a ride through city traffic and then gave him a sparkling clean cell , equipped with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked to use the first , but people kept passing the door and privacy was unobtainable , so he lay down on the bed and went to sleep . Later they woke him for an excellent meal : meat loaf ,  |p193stewed  tomatoes , peas , and raspberry Jello . It was so deliciousthat tears came to Detweiler 's eyes . He took tiny mouthfuls so as to prolong the pleasure . The only thing missing was A-i Sauce . He called the guard . " You would n't happen to have any A-1 Sauce ? " The guard was about to respond with leaden irony ( ai n't no hotel ) , but looking at Detweiler 's face , he checked the impulse . He felt as if he had but narrowly avoided committinga breach of manners ; had been on the point of breaking wind before one of his own offspring . Instead he said gravely : " I 'll see . " He went into the room in which a delegation of officers awaited the out-of-town detectives , expected to arrive by air within the hour . Reporterswere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functionary 's care in his term of service , and they never bored him , though his strategy was often to pretend otherwise . He was always interested to hear of their subsequent disposal whether by electrocution , gas chamber , or lifelong immurement ; whatever , he had if only in a small way participated , and a man 's work is peculiarly associated with his being . For some he even felt pity . He was , however , not sorry for Detweiler . He took him seriously . He went to the chief of detectives , who was just finishinga one-word , yet long-drawn-out response to the commentof a subordinate : " Yeahh "  --  a sour , negative sort of affirmation . When he finished he retained enough of the accompanying facial expression to turn it on the guard . " He wants some sauce for his meat . " It was already the custom not to sound Detweiler 's name . " He can go fuck himself . " It was not the chief who an/swered , but the subordinate , a young detective endeavoringby various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slackness of jaw . But the chief said to the guard : " I guess we would n't want them to say we ca n't take care of their prisoners . " To the young detective : " Go down to the delicatessen . " " Which one ? " " Oh shit , " said the chief . " Where they have the policy game , on the corner . Unless you want to pay for it your-self . " " A-1 Sauce , " said the guard . Shuster decided to go himself to extradite Detweiler , and took Tierney as his partner . Tierney was in trouble . Shuster first accepted that as a fact when the man ahead of Tierney shoved a briefcase too far under the seat and it emerged behind , encroaching on the detective 's foot room . Tierney kicked it back viciously , but as the aircraft took off the case returned , like a bad conscience . The owner seemed alreadyasleep . Tierney unbuckled his own belt and hurled the case into the overhead rack . Of course the stewardess appeared on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so doing showed an inch of sexless white slip between navy-blue jacket and skirt . As always with them , she was so girdled as seemingly to have but one buttock . She gave the case to Tierney . " Please put this under your seat , sir . And please fasten your belt . " Tierney went into an inarticulate rage . He tried to buckle his belt while holding the case . His coat gaped open , revealingthe pistol at his left waist . Seeing it , the stewardess lost the spuriously sweet , falsely committed expression she had been trained to show even during outright disaster . Herp195trace of mouth disappeared , she turned her putty-face towards the cockpit and began to walk in that direction . Shuster climbed over Tierney . Without apparent haste he caught her at the cockpit door . " Miss , " he said , " we 're police officers . That 's why the gun . " " I know , " she said " Are you following someone on board ? " Shuster said no . " I still have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on general principles disliked any publicitywhatever . It was never to a detective 's advantage to be recognized by anybody . " Because he 's in authority . " She opened the door , giving Shuster a brief glimpse of that seat of power , all switches , from which he was excluded , and closed it behind her . Depressed by the exchange , he returned to find Tierney had apparently dumped the case in the owner 's lap , a tightassedmidtown type , and was glaring at the back of his short haircut . " You need a drink , " Shuster told his subordinate . " Move over and take the window seat . " Tierney 's state was altered by what he interpreted as generosity , though Shuster 's motive was rather in the interests of convenience . But then when Shuster attempted something genuinely kind , Tierney froze . Shuster said : " I do n't know what you 're doing with Betty Bayson , and I do n't want to , but in the end you 're not going to like yourself . " Tierney asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilet ? " He scrambled out over Shuster 's legs , so that the point in changing seats was lost . If an officer wanted a piece he could always get it from aP196female less troublesome than Betty Bayson : the women relativesof offenders were always better game than witnesses . Detweiler was sleeping again when the extraditing detectivesarrived , but woke up as they stood outside the bars with their local colleagues and looked at him . He gazed drowsily at them and then his eyes drifted away in indifference , like those of a lion in a zoo . Tierney was in a strange state of mind . He despised criminals in an impersonal way , more so when they had been apprehended than while the pursuit continued : in captivity they bore the additional stench of failure . Psychoticsof course were another matter : the first problem was to determine whether a given example was genuinely a psycho or faking . That determination was not legally a policeman 's business , yet try to find the officer who would not make it . You had to . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detweiler , Tierney experienced the onset of two convictions . One , that Detweiler was crazy and thus necessarily beyond moral judgment . Tierney could not have explained this decision . Nothing in Detweiler 's appearance was even eccentric  --  except perhaps his suit . The second feature of Tierney 's reaction was that he hated Detweiler immediately , desperately , savagely . He would have liked to beat him to death and beyond : to pulp him , as it were , trampling his vital organs . This passion was unprecedented ; he had felt nothing like it when , the year before , he had collared the pimpled wretch who sodomizedand mutilated a two-year-old or the apish truck driver who killed his sick wife with repeated blows to the head . Tierney did not disclose these feelings to anyone elsep197either by deed , word , or implication . He apparently looked at Detweiler with the same indifference as that with which the killer gazed at him . Eventually he was coupled to Detweiler by the handcuff 's other claw , and the three of them , Shuster and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , who never read the newspapers , might very well never know precisely of his disposition . If a fellow communicant in spiritualism brought up the matter , she could be relied on to dismiss it neatly . Such money as remained after paying the lawyer he would have forwardedto her . She might through extrasensory means get some sense of him , but since he was not in trouble  --  trouble to Detweiler being when things did not add up , which was scarcely the case now he was on his way towards execution  --  she would not know pain . He soon fell asleep once more ; it was serene to float upon an ocean of clouds . Tierney avoided looking at Detweiler , but felt his attachedarm grow slack . Shuster sat behind them , alone in that row , whether by arrangement or merely because of a shortage of passengers , Tierney did not know . In Shuster 's company he was nowadays a flunky . Shuster knew nothing of the actual relations between him and Betty : the man was bluffing , as he so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported only that he and Mrs. Bayson had revisited the Starr apartment on her suggestion . Her memory of the missing stuffed animal might have proved valuable had not Detweiler come in of his own volition . It was all reasonable . Unless that patrolman , Spinelli , was one of Shuster 's informants . The lieutenant had various spies throughout the Force , though he complained himselfof being spied on by his departmental enemies . For his part , Shuster did not believe in criminal insanity.  |p198That  was a defense lawyer 's tripe or , worse , a psychiatrist 's . Detweiler , he thought , might beat the rap . He was lightcomplexioned . He had turned himself in , and he had confessedin a style used by those who intended to plead insanity . Shuster disliked the interrogation of psychos . You had to listen to a lot of malarkey , and then their lawyers always managed to suggest to the jury that you abused them . His heart fell as he perused the typescript of Detweiler 's interminable composition for the newspaper . He kept getting lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met by a delegation of policemen and an entourage of official cars . Shuster 's schedulewas to wait until the other passengers had struggled into their coats and exited , before he rose and signaled to Tierneythat they should haul Detweiler out . A reporter and photographer came aboard . Disregarding the stewardesses , Tierney threatened to shove the camera up someone 's rectum , and Shuster , agreeing with him for once , vowed silently to take the badge of the officer who had let them by , but was forced to abolish that resolution when he reached the open hatch and recognized the police commissioner standing at the bottom of the mobile stair . The press and TV had their way for the next quarterhour . Detweiler cooperated with the cameramen , looking this way and that on command , but he said nothing in answer to the shouted questions , which were hardly serious . Anyway , he had signed a contract giving exclusive rights to his utterances to the newspaper and its syndicate , and he was not the one to go back on his word . Eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car and sat , like the filling of a sandwich , between the two detectiveswho had accompanied him on the airplane.  |p199For  the first time he spoke to the man to whom he was handcuffed . " Will I be fed again ? " Tierney did not answer . He continued to repeat his fantasy concerning Detweiler 's activities as a resident of the Starr apartment . Betty denied that her relations with the killer had been intimate , but Tierney took this rather as circumstantial evidence that they had been at it like rabbits . She was hateful and vicious and cunning enough to know she could hurt him , Tierney , more by maintaining this fictionthan by admitting what was obvious to reason . Shuster said : " You cooperate with us , son , and we 'll cooperate with you . " The old bastard never forgot his job . Detweiler noticed from his limited view of the world outside that every trace of snow had already vanished from the city streets , and he found it interesting to think that if he had scooped a cupful of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a refrigerator he would by now have a rare substance , indeed probably unique : old snow . Frozen time . At police headquarters he was conducted into the midst of more newspapermen , and the commissioner was there again , and also , finally , the man whose responsibility it was to see him condemned to death . Detweiler therefore was interested in him . He was in somewhat the same relation to Detweiler as Detweiler had been to the Starr women and the boarder . This man , wearing a suit of beautiful brown flannel , approachedhim and said , " Joseph Detweiler , did you  --  " " Excuse me , " Detweiler interrupted , firmly though not in the slightest degree insolent.  |p200Nor  did the man take it so , being in no doubt of his authority . He said , below his long nose and short lip : " I am the district attorney of this county . " He peered for a moment at Detweiler and added patiently : " My name is Crews . " Detweiler said : " You can beat me if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The district attorney 's heavy eyebrows crawled up his steep forehead . " We do n't do that sort of thing . " Then he gazed abstractly at everyone and no one , and asked : " Con-tract ? " Tierney was still there , behind the principals , no longer manacled to the killer . He waited respectfully until it was apparent no one else would speak , then elucidated : " Sir , I think he believes his agreement to give the exclusive story to the newspaper means he ca n't talk to anybody . " Crews said : " Will you take my word for it that your contractdoes not apply to what you tell us ? " " I certainly will , Mr. Crews , " Detweiler replied . That was a weight off him . The district attorney 's brows had not yet come down . " Well then , " he said , " did you murder Mrs. Wilma Starr , Miss Wilhelmina Starr , and Mr. E. C. Appleton on ChristmasEve last ? " " No ! " Detweiler said with force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " " All right , all right , " said the police commissioner , who on arriving at headquarters had lost the gladhanded politician'scharm he had shown at the airport . " We want to hear exactly what you did and how . " " I 'm sorry , " said Detweiler . " I do n't want this distorted . I think I better wait until my attorney arrives . "  |p201Once  again the D.A . addressed the room at large . " Who is his counsel ? " Shuster answered in the anonymous voice he reserved for such occasions : " Henry Webster Melrose . " " I have heard of him , " responded the D.A. , and everyonebut Detweiler smirked painfully.  |p202MELROSE  DID NOT like to defend madmen . Otherwise he had few prejudices as to clients . He had represented so many professional killers that his enemies had success in labeling him as a gangsters ' counsel , with the implication that he was therefore himself a criminal . This reputation proved of great value , bringing him not only more businessfrom the mobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into trouble : and if condemned for taking an enormous fee from the employers of one Joe Guglielmo , accusedof murdering one Vito Marino with a sawed-off shotgun and sinking the corpse , weighted with a cargo of cast-iron objects , into a body of water , Melrose could always point to his subsequent defense of some penniless Negro charged with breaking his wife 's neck in a family quarrel . Melrose could have done so if he wished , but as it hap/pened he never defended himself : he had too much contempt for others . In return , except by the disreputable elements , he was universally feared and detested , for his associations , for his arrogance , but mostly for his habitual courtroom victories . He had served as defense counsel in eighty-two capital cases and had never yet lost a client to the executioner . As to the moral guilt of his clients , Melrose had no interest whatever . If they confessed to him , as they sometimes did , his immediate and only concern was as to whether they had also done so to anyone available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the district attorney possessed a detailed statement admitting all and signed by the creature Melrose must defend , along with eight eyeball witnesses . Melrose preferred hopeless cases and preposterously unfavorable odds . He loathed criminals and , as a man who lived by his wits , despised violence . Had he been a police officer , no lawbreaker would have received his mercy . As a judge he would have been implacable  --  and furthermore would never have tolerated a Melrose in his court . But as it stood he was neither more nor less than an attorneyat law , and his opponents must encounter him on that ground or void the field . In any trial that which was tried was the prosecution 's case . According to the great and fundamental principle of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence , the accuser bore the burden of proof . Not even the massive power of the state could penetrate this armor into which Melrose had buckled himself at the beginning of his career and in which he expected to be buried , like Frederick the Great in his impregnable Prussian uniform . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had no political ambitions , no social or ethnic identifications , and secretly , and contrary to the charges of his enemies , he was essentially modest . His opinion of himself was not so high as his assessment of others was low . He existed in a time and place in which , it seemed to him , only relative judgments were feasible : he perhaps came off better than most because he was almost alone in wanting to practice his profession : to do the job , and not to gain love or power or the approbation of anonymous hordes living or dead . The Detweiler case had every recommendation but one . It was certainly hopeless enough at first glance . The killer had not only confessed , but to a sensational newspaper for a large fee . The crime was gaudy and peculiarly outrageousto the layman : female victims , one a mother , and on Christmas Eve . Detweiler had been billed by the papers , pejoratively , as an artist ; a jury 's unfavorable bias might be assumed . If the public could be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by other mass murders of the year ; six victims of a berserk gunman in Oakland , California ; four , including the suicide of the perpetrator , his entire family , in Battle Creek , Michigan ; and the work of a killer-rapist in St. Louis . Detweiler 's achievement might be seen as the continuation of a trend , which if not stopped by the stern hand of justice might , etc. , etc . And that he had not attacked his female victims sexually or committed theft might be to his disadvantage : Melrose could sometimes lead a jury into a curious sympathy for the perpetrator of a crime-for-gain : who among humankind felt no lust or cupidity ? Furthermore , Melrose was hungry for battle . It had been a good fourteen months since the last trial which quickenedp205his blood . Like a Don Juan who surfeited with easy conquestscould feel desire only in the pursuit of very special prey  --  novice nuns , frigid princesses  --  he gained no sustenancefrom the routine diet . In the Guglielmo case , more than a year before , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idiosyncrasy of the killer 's weapon , a shortened twelve-gauge shotgun with a quirk in its sear which permitted the arm to fire only when held at a downward angle from the horizontal . As only Melroseand the defendant knew , Guglielmo had first to knock his victim to the ground before discharging into him the double load . In court Melrose opened a fresh box of Super-X shells , chose two of the blunt red cylinders , and having passed them among the jurors for examination , dropped them into the breech . He presented the weapon to his assistant counsel . " The safety , Mr. Willingham , is not on . " Much of Melrose 's pleasure owed to his awareness that both the judge and the prosecutor would have been peculiarlygratified to see his head blown off . The jury of course were enthralled , except for Number Three , a sardonic-looking man in whose countenance Melrose had watched unsympathy grow throughout the trial . " Now , Mr. Willingham , would you please place the barrelsat my chin . " His assistant took care to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the twin openings of barrel . " Now , Mr. Willingham . " His voice was necessarily distorted . " Will you be so good as to squeeze the triggers . " The cynical juror stared aloft in disgust . He was very dear to Melrose at this moment.  | " Squeeze , Mr. Willingham , squee-ee-eeze . " The sear held , refused to release the hammers . Melrose called for greater force of finger , he was in a seizure of ecstasy , only the external symptoms of which were for display : at such a moment , only at such a moment , did he experience a maximum sense of life . The judge soon called an end to the demonstration ; the prosecutor inveighed against the courtroom circus ; the jury subsequently acquittedGuglielmo . Melrose waited for the discharge of the jury , so as to thank its members as was his custom , and his warmest reception came from Number Three , who in the world to which he was returning , that bleak world outside the courtroom , worked as an alteration tailor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the other eleven more or less against you when we went out . They took the shotgun thing as a trick , Mr. Melrose . " Melrose smiled within while showing aggrieved astonishmentwithout : nothing gave him more gratification than a favorable verdict returned by a jury who knew it had been hoaxed . " One man , he knew guns , says you rigged it , " the tailor went on . " I say nobody can fix an exhibit . He says Melrose can get to anybody or thing . I says , if he had the judge in his pocket why did the judge never sustain an objection of his while always for the prosecution ? I says why did the judge threaten him many times with contempt . He says to make it look good . " " You must be an eloquent man , Mr. Kleinsinger , " Melrosesaid . He was still pleasantly astounded in particular but not in general at the revelation that Kleinsinger , his supposedenemy , had been his actual friend . In a murder trialp207there were no absolute surprises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been lost , and another was at stake . Every soul involved was under the mortal pressure of the grand hazard . Melrose disapproved of capital punishment , but without it his profession would be but a game and humanity thereby devalued . He had never sought a license to practice in any jurisdiction in which executionwas not the ultimate penalty . What Kleinsinger had done was to mask a marked bias in his favor . This juror 's tactic was not unknown to Melrose , but he had misjudged Kleinsinger 's appearance , which as seen from the defense table had not suggested sentimentality . Kleinsinger said : " No , I ca n't take such credit . I held out for a point . I says your client was a hood and he might have shot the other one , but the prosecution never proved it in this courtroom beyond a reasonable doubt . Is n't that the idea of justice ? If the state wants to take a life , even of an evil person , they got to have a hundred per cent excuse . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do you believe in God , Mr. Kleinsinger ? " Melrose asked . Kleinsinger replied proudly : " In fact I do not . I believe in being a Mensch . " Melrose thanked him and , without irony and though he had already lost interest in the tailor , who had not proved as subtle as he first supposed , said : " God bless you . " In trials as in sex , the more glorious the moment , the more deathlike the succeeding quiescence . If only Detweilerwere not a psychopath . But the newspaper publisher , when Melrose returned his call , said of that there could be no doubt , and was cheer/fully positive on this matter owing to his vulgar misapprehensionMelrose would find it attractive . " I 'm sorry , " Melrose replied : " I can not take the case . " The publisher said : " This means a great deal to me personally . " " I gave my word to him that I would get you . " " I do n't accept that as placing me under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside , I am on general principlesdisinclined to place any great value on the word ' of the press . " " All right , " the publisher said in a jollying tone . " I 'll play along with you and your reputation for giving a hard time to respectable elements . " He raised the offered fee . " No , " said Melrose . " Look , Melrose , I do n't want to be gross , but you are getting to be known by the public in recent years as almost exclusively a hoodlums ' lawyer . I personally do n't like to see this happen . You are a man of extraordinary talents  --  " " I merely practice my profession , sir . I am not a moralist . " " But here 's my point , " said the publisher . " This boy is crazy as a bedbug , yet that in itself wo n't save him . We just ca n't take a chance on some inferior defense lawyer . Crews had blood in his eye and is no idiot whatever else you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nomination . He may be approaching desperation : I do n't have to tell you that his last term as D.A . has not been distinguished . He will be out to fry this boy . Now , I have spent an afternoon with Detweiler . At first he was merely a story to me . I had never before sat in a room with a murderer  --  " " I know , " Melrose broke in , " and you discovered to your surprise that he was human . Again and again over the yearsp209your trashy papers have editorially called for vengeance against the so-called enemies of society , and this is the first one you have ever laid eyes on . " " Now you are being moralistic , " said the publisher . " I think I have you there . And uninformed , as well . Some of those editorials have been written by former police reporterswho have seen as many criminals as you . " " But not in the same way , " Melrose said soberly . Nevertheless , the man had scored a point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . He is sick . " " You are qualified to make that diagnosis ? " " I am not on the stand , Mr. Melrose , " the publisher said waspishly . " I know something about men . I know Detweiler is mad . " He paused . " He has no malice in him . " Melrose was suddenly embarrassed . He found he could not explain his prejudice against maniacs without revealing more of himself than he could afford to do . Surely one of the reasons for which a man becomes an attorney at law is to evade the law as applied to himself , to be an officer of the court of life and not a defendant , to speak always for others , the state or the accused , and never oneself ; and yet so to celebrate the self . Else the Law was unbearable . In self-protection , then , Melrose felt compelled to take the case . But he could not let this pretentious ass think he had been won over by the argument . Until he accepted Detweiler as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or died , sane or crazy . So what he did was to demand a fee precisely twice as large as that which he had been offered . The publisher agreed , but whether Melrose had deceived him could not be determined at this time . Powerful men , Melrose knew ,  |p210could  often be manipulated more easily than janitors , but they were more skilled in concealment . It had been a defeat for Melrose nevertheless . Finally it was he who had been manipulated by his own vanity . His clients were all the same to him ; whether innocent men or rogues , he shared with them a community of interest . Their motives had been rational . If killers , they had murdered for a reason : money or hatred or jealousy . If wrongfully accused , they had yet been arrested in a situation or conditionwhich suggested to rational men  --  the police and the district attorney  --  that they had committed the crime for rational motives . There were rules to the ensuing battle , and Melrose 's joy was to exploit the possibilities within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sonnet . That he was often misidentified as a maverick or even an anarchist testified rather to the quality of his enemies than his own . But a madman was something other , a resident of a differentuniverse of discourse , with no neighbors , feeling no affinity even with other maniacs ; by his very existence derisive of Melrose 's art , wit , life . And that Detweiler was psychotic , Melrose had been certain from his first perusal of the newspaper stories , he who was famous for objecting to any qualitative description of a client 's manner by a nonprofessionalwitness . Q. Please describe the defendant as you saw him on the morning of the twenty-ninth . A. He seemed nervous . MR . MELROSE . Objection , Witness is not a psychiatrist . If the witness were an alienist Melrose went at him as a ferret at a rabbit : Had not all psychoanalysts themselvesp211been psychoanalyzed ? This question reminded jurors of the folk wisdom , immanent in most allegedly normal men , which held that he who trafficked in derangement was himselfperhaps deranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a criminal lawyer was touched with crime . . . . Were there not many different schools of thought in psychiatry ? Was the witness a member of such a school ? If he was , Melrose managed to suggest organizationalrigidity and bias ; if not , his subsequent questions tended to reflect on the possible irresponsibility of the freelance , the eclectic , the practitioner who could not make up his mind . Of course the prosecutor objected all along the line , which served , whether or not he was sustained , in fixing the matter ever more firmly in the jurors ' minds . Melrose was no less zealous in the protection and enhancementof psychiatric testimony for the defense . He kept available at least two professionals who would fearlesslystate that theirs was an exact science , reliable as physics : one with a German accent , another as Americanlookingas a highway patrolman . A sane man , greatly exercised because of drink , passion , anger , might strangle a woman . As means of murder went , strangulation was really one of the kinder forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In taste it was more palatable than a man 's discharging a firearm into the flesh of another human being or drawing a blade across a throat . It was intimate , an extension of an embrace ; human , not mechanized or chemical . But to strangle two women in succession , neither for love nor money , was for Melrose conclusive evidence of madness . He did not in such a personal judgment think legally . He who lived to practice his trade never confusedp212it with life , and thus remained its master and not a servant . What he believed privately of Detweiler would have no influence on the representation he would make in public , in court , according to the Law which neither he nor Detweilerhad made . Therefore he should now not be disturbed . He despised such clients as Guglielmo , the killer-for-hire , stupid and brutish , and yet with a clear conscience freed them to murderagain . But it was clean work , a man 's job , a fair contest between himself and the prosecution . With a psycho , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were somehow dirtied except the defendant , whose peculiarity was that he could not be touched by other human beings , not even by the man who had saved his life . Melrose recognized that he was jealous of Detweiler . He packed his suitcase and drove the rented car from Fort Lauderdale to Miami Airport , at one point , near Dania , crushing a host of the land crabs who suicidally frequent the highway after dark . He disliked the sound , but knew no other route . He was something of a gastronome , but according to the natives these crustaceans were inedible , unliketheir marine cousins , the famous Floridian stone crabs of which he was fond . Melrose stood five feet nine and a half inches and weighed 196 pounds . At forty-nine he was a bachelor . Over the years his sexual tastes had grown so special that he was hardly ever nowadays gratified , and had all but forsaken the quest for women who were elegant but not so much so as to lack sympathy , were aware of his career but never asked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in their early thirties without havingbeen married and yet not noticeably neurotic about their situation , above all not bitter.  |p213Melrose  had actually never met a woman who filled the bill in every particular and was also tall and wan-complexioned , his physical requirements . And while in earlier days he might find a certain amusement with those who missed perfection by as much as half , from forty-five on he tended to accept his lonely lot . He could not imagine not living alone . When he had had love affairs he never spent the night with the girl , always climbed out of bed to go , or to drive her , home . This distaste to share his private life extendedalso to friends . He had been invited to Lauderdale by a prosperous old Army buddy and wife , who lived in luxurious vulgarity on one of the canals . But Melrose would not stay in the guest room though it had its own bath . " Who is he hiding in that beach apartment he rented ? " the wife asked her husband . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melrose 's erstwhilecomrade-in-arms . " He would never sit on anybody else 's bunk . I can still remember that . Or borrow money . But I guess he likes us or he would n't come at all ? " " I suppose he 'll eat here once or twice anyway , " the wife said stubbornly . " I 'll find those Frenchy recipes for the cook , which he seemed to like last time , and you better check your wine cellar and have the right years . " Despite her air of annoyance on the subject of Melrose , she was partial to him . He was the only male friend of her husband 's who commented on her clothes . And if she expressed opinions , he listened and did not pick out little flaws in her logic , smiled in the right places , in others waited for elucidations with shrewd eyes . His reputation for barracuda tactics in the courtroom saved him , for her , from being hypocritical ; he could cut her to ribbons if he wished , but was too gallant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which shep214was always reminded after Melrose had left and the nervousnessshe felt in his presence had been replaced by despondency . He had been visiting them for years , and yet she felt he did not know her at all . Melrose was fond of these people , who were like a family to him , too fond to call them from the airport . He would instead write when he got home . He had his sentimental side . For some hours after Detweiler announced his firm intentionnot to speak further in the absence of his lawyer , they continued to question him anyway . He supposed they could not be blamed for this persistence though it was foolhardy to try to get him to break his word . But policemen work with so many criminals that they find it difficult to understand the motives of a man of honor who happens to run afoul of the law . He listened with alternative indignation and amusement , both concealed , to questions based on an assumption that , because Mrs. Starr and Billie were women , something dirty was involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex fiend . Betty . But Betty was an angel . He could not bring her into this worldly business of cops and courts and lawyers , this man 's affair . He would instead , now that he looked forward to imprisonment for a certain period  --  because he knew trials were not quick to start and subsequent executionsnot immediate  --  he would resume his work on Realization , jail being the perfect laboratory for such an endeavor . Odd that this had not occurred to him before , but one sometimessearches endlessly for what lies at hand . If he Realized Mrs. Starr and Billie , and the boarder as well , theyp215could certify that he definitely had done nothing filthy to the women . However , he was distracted at the moment , not by the questions of the important officials , but by the presence , in the back of the room , of the detective to whom he had been handcuffed on the returning airplane . This man had avoided looking at him during the flight , but now that they were no longer joined in steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervening persons , he was aware of the detective 's close watch on his countenance . The man had a peculiar interest in him , beyond the superficialities of police work . It was personal , not organizational , and expressiveof a genuine human requirement . Detweiler had sensed his distress across the manacles , but at the time it would have been out of order , bad taste , to breach the associationof captor and captive , to sully the dignity and equilibrium of this traditional arrangement , by word or deed . Now , however , they were in another situation . One which , furthermore , the detective understood , as revealed by his explanation to the district attorney of Detweiler 's agreement with the newspaper , his admirable disposal of the misapprehensions on both sides . He was in a unique sympathy with Detweiler , though he himself might very well be unaware of it . It was Detweiler 's observation that so many people failed to understand where their interests lie and thus are selfresistant . Detweiler sat at the head of a plain wooden table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no more so over his chair than any other . None of his interrogators struck matches slowly or turned a spotlight on his face orp216threatened him . It was cosy , the collective body-heat all to the good , for the room had been cool on entry . The district attorney was saying : " . . . anything to the women after you strangled them ? " Detweiler said : " They promised me , in the car coming here from the airport , that I would be fed again . " " How about it , Joe ? You 'll have to tell it sooner or later . " Crews chuckled , reached over and playfully slapped Detweiler'sforearm . " Now , I would say you were pretty clever to stay silent  --  if you had n't already admitted these killings . I think you would have been so hard to crack , frankly , that I am certainly grateful you confessed . You have really helped us , but why stop there ? Unless you give us more of the particulars , we will probably assume the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy . I 'll have to bring you to trial because that 's my job , but I can do it gently or I can do it in a pretty unfriendly way , because I figure the man who does n't cooperate with me is no friend of mine , so why should I help him ? I just do n't know yet about this case . You surely had a good reason for killing three people . I 'd like to hear whether it 's good or bad . " " What about that promise to feed me ? " asked Detweiler . The D.A . ' s eyes roamed for a while as if he were tracking a bird through the sky . Then he said quietly : " Who made it ? " Detweiler pointed over Mr. Crews 's head to the older detective , standing behind , and he was interested to hear that the D.A . knew who it was without turning . " Shuster , " said Crews . " Yes sir . " " Get him something to eat . " " Yes sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't mean you . Send What's-his-name . " " Tierney , " said Shuster . So that was it : Tierney . Detweiler thought it a very good name , and was annoyed that the district attorney had not known it . Mr. Crews went down several degrees in Detweiler'sestimation : not to know the name of one of the men he sent to fetch a fugitive seemed irresponsible . Detweiler still did not feel it was his own place to use the name , so he spoke to Tierney informally , as the detectivemoved towards the door . " What I would like is a tunafish-salad sandwich on white bread without mayo , and a chocolate milk shake . " Tierney stopped and looked at him silently . Mr. Crews helpfully told Detweiler : " He is waiting because you have not said whether you want lettuce . " " Oh , " said Detweiler . " Well , what do you think ? By this time of night the lettuce is likely to be wilted . " Just as this care for detail was causing Detweiler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barked nastily : " Get going , Tierney ! " Tierney did as told . As it happened , he was not nearly so upset as Detweiler by the D.A . ' s failure to know his name . Nor was he outraged by having to act as errand boy or waiter for a murderer . Tierney seldom allowed himself to be victimized by false pride . In the case of Betty Bayson the issuesof pride were real . Had she gone to bed with Detweiler ? He had concentrated his personality on this one question , like a monster . Yet as he took a . devious exit from the building in order to elude the newspapermen who infested the main passages , and went out through the streets , Tier/ney was an efficient officer , alert , semper paratus , suspicious of current phenomena . He saw two punks straining to jump a light , gave them a hard look ; which they returned too idly to suggest the car was stolen . Then he passed a polo-coated man who breathed stertorouslyand moved in a slightly eccentric stride . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was closed , the glass , with no light behind it , reflecting the far side of the street and the pedestrians thereon . Before Tierneyacted on what he saw , a patrolman came along testing doors . Tierney said , giving unobtrusive directional signals : " Black coat , brown hat , carrying something in the folded newspaper . His mark 's the drunk in the polo coat . " The patrolman said : " Shit , he 's made us ! " Tierney turned quickly to watch the potential mugger drop the paper , and whatever was inside , in a litter basket and walk smartly westward . They did the same , the beat cop snatchingup the discarded tabloid without breaking stride : it contained a length of iron pipe . They fell in beside the suspect , Tierney inside and the patrolman on the curb . The man was fair-complexioned , in his middle twenties , and still retained some acne . They walked him to a darkenedblock and around the corner , the uniformed officer inquiring as to name , address , and profession , and enumeratingthe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's name was Horace Manners . He said , respectfully : " It is n't illegal to carry a piece of pipe if you 're a plumber 's assistant . " " No , it is n't , Horace , " said the patrolman . He shoved Manners , face-forward , against the wall of a building , frisked him , then pounded him to the ground with the pipe . He helped Manners up , and said : " I 'll call you when my toilet is busted , Horace . " He began to work him over again and seemed to have the situation in hand , so Tierney left them and went to the Chinese restaurant he had originally been heading for . He ordered egg rolls and chicken chow mein to go , and while he waited he watched the pimps and their whores having a late dinner before the girls went on their tours of duty . Tierney had once brought his wife to this restaurant , on a rare occasion when they could afford to eat out ; but early in the evening , long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like her image of any other kind of lowlifer , had its source in the movies : a busty redhead who swayed along the street swinging a beaded purse . A hood was a pockmarked guy who talked from the side of the mouth . A rapist was a big Negro , and so on . His wife stayed altogether innocent of evil , and it was to Tierney 's taste to keep her so , his home being his castle , though his work permitted him to return there only intermittently . He had seen his wife only once , briefly , since the strange episode with Betty Bayson . Tierney lived in a two-bedroom apartment , and was father to two young children and a baby . Before taking the flight , he had gone home to change his shirt and underwear and collect his toilet articles . He could have used a shave at the moment : his chin felt grainy from the inside . Tierney dreaded being soiled in any fashion . He decided to call his wife , which was not necessarily considerate in view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to hear from him for extended periods . She would not be worrying now ; undoubtedly she was asleep . It was therefore not a kind impulse that took him to thep220wall phone in the grimy passage between dining room and kitchen . No booth : the instrument hung unprotected and the caller rather more so in the traffic of rice bowls . Katharine answered in the middle of the second ring . The home phone stood at bedside . " Sorry , Kath , if you were sleeping . Just letting you know I 'm back . " Tierney pressed himself against the wall to avoid a passing tray . She said : " No , somebody called about midnight and woke me up . And woke up the kids . And we all got settled when now  --  " " I 'll be down here all night , " Tierney said . " Who called ? " " An informant . " Crime being an exclusively human enterprise , when criminalswere apprehended it was usually because of informationreceived by the police from other human beings . More often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than whom no one could speak with more authority on the subject . Every detective had his own collection of stool pigeons , known to himself alone . These relationships were characterized by a peculiar mutual loyalty , much more reliable than any association based on sex or even money , though the officer usually paid the informant a small sum for each item . The stoolie 's real satisfaction came from betrayingmore successful criminals than himself , and in his clandestine but substantive connection with the law : he was in effect the detective 's detective , the fingernail at the end of the long arm . As to Tierney , he would sooner have sold his wife on the street than to reveal the identity of one of his stoolies even to Shuster . That simply was not done . Several of his informants preferred to call him at home ,  |p222so  that if they were under observation or spoke on a tapped phone , the number would not signify police headquarters . But this call was unlikely to refer to the Detweiler case . Stoolies , like everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because , " his wife went on , " she did n't leave a name or number . " He did not ask Katharine to repeat the pronoun , though he had no female informants . He said : " I guess that was one of my girl friends . " Katharine 's habitual laugh was a tone lower than her speech ; it was sometimes called " dirty " by her old school pal , Margaret Walsh , with whom she drank coffee almost every afternoon . She laughed now and said , with the stage Irish accent she often assumed for purposes of levity , and which Tierney hated , hated with all his heart , for in neither of their families had there been in living memory anyonewith a genuine brogue and besides hers sounded nothing like an Ireland Irishman 's , but rather like a Jewish comedian doing a Gaelic imposture ; but which Tierney found it impossible to protest against in view of the profoundmeaning it obviously had for Katharine , who might , in bed , as his hand traveled downwards across her navel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She currently was saying : " Tell me what kind of girl would be so shtoopid as to call a man at his marriage bed , now ? " A smiling Chinese gestured at Tierney with a paper bag . Tierney said : " That 's the only kind I can get . " He had been at first shocked , then furious : who did that rotten bitch Betty think she was , calling his home . He controlledhimself briefly , so as to tell Kath , as usual , he wouldp222see her when he saw her , hung up , grabbed the bag , paid the Chink , and left . Lucky for the pimps that they were seated well off his route , or perhaps unlucky : some were faggots , with a taste for brutality administered by attractiveyoung policemen . Back at headquarters , Tierney received another surprise . Shuster stood outside the closed door of the interrogation room . " Here 's one for you , kid , " said the lieutenant . " He says he 'll talk now , but only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels is attuned to him , and a whole lot of other baloney . " Shuster ha-ha 'd : the reverse of Katharine 's , his laugh did not sound dirty but usually was . " Let me tell you this : when an alleged psycho starts talking you would wish he was back strangling women . That little prick will keep you up all night . " Tierney went inside . The district attorney and the others were on their feet , and Detweiler sat where he had been . " All right , then , " said the D.A. , apparently to both Tierneyand Detweiler , as if they were in a conspiracy . Then to Tierney : " He does n't want a stenographer yet , though I told him he will have to go all through it again so it can be taken down . " " No problem , Mr. Crews , " Detweiler said brightly . " Tierney , wo n't you sit down ? " The police commissioner asked for Tierney 's gun . Tierney understood the precautionary measure : he was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feeling that his colleagues were abandoning him morally.  |p223DETWEILER  OPENED the bag and carefully withdrew the cardboard containers . He looked at the egg rolls , the rice , the chicken chow mein , the fried noodles . He said to Tierney : " This is quite a provocation . " Tierney lifted his expressionless eyes and said " O.K. , you wanted to talk . " Detweiler stated : " Nobody provokes anyone else unless he has some special interest in him . The others have done what I asked . But not because they like me , or hate me . They are just doing their jobs , and they figure that it 's a kind of trade : I 'll do what they want if they do what I want . I am really learning something . I thought the police used force pure and simple . I expected to get beaten up , whereas I have never been treated more nicely . I will certainly tell that to the press . " " You love publicity , do n't you ? " Tierney asked  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you say that ? " " You turned yourself in to a newspaper . " " I see . . . . Well , maybe it 's not right to ask you this , Tierney , because doing a particular job well requires a narrownessof focus , I believe , but I wonder if you ever , in your off-duty life anyway , considered the multitude of interpretationsthat can be made of a single phenomenon ? " He paused , but Tierney remained silent . Detweiler continued : " I never went to the paper with an idea of doing what turned out to be the case . But accidents occurred : at least , they seemed like accidents , though perhaps they were opportunities . " He closed the containers and pushed them across the table , saying : " I do n't eat Chinese food unless my stomach is upset . Anyway , you did n't bring implements to eat it with . " Tierney took from his breast pocket a pair of plastic chopsticksencased in cellophane . He had forgotten them , but one never apologizes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detweiler said : " Would you like to know why I picked you ? " " I 'd rather hear about the homicides , " Tierney said , in a gritty voice , but as if to himself . " Did you expect to bend me to your will ? " asked Detweiler . " Was this a kind of test , whether or not I would eat something as different as could be from what I ordered ? " Tierney answered levelly : " You have admitted killing three persons . Now I understand that you are ready to explainhow and why these crimes were perpetrated . I do n't know why you want me in particular to hear the explanation , and I do n't care . As for the food , you are in the custodyp225of the police , and you will eat what you are given or go without eating . It does n't matter to me . There 's nothing special about you , once you are here . You are a lousy little runt who flopped at everything you ever tried except the strangling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , could n't hold a job , you go into tantrums because a harmless guy next door plays his radio . But you 're a genius , are n't you ? A philosopher . You do n't have to observe the rules of decent , ordinary slobs . If they get in your way , and they are women , or their backs are turned , you assault them . " Tierney leaned across the table . " To me you are yellow and phony and a pervert , a stinking little rat . You pull any more of that philosopher shit on me and you 'll go out tomorrowwith the garbage collection . " When a suspect is eager to talk , as Detweiler had announcedhe was , his interrogator is properly at great pains to do nothing which might impede the flow ; rather , to encourage , to affirm , to reward ; to repress that which suggests punishment or a division of the common interest . This is the time of conversion , when with the sanction of all authority , criminals serve the law and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplying mislaid items . There is extant , on both sides , good will , a feeling of accomplishment in cohesion , a sense of history . What can man not achieve when he joins hands with his fellows and forsakes destructive individuality . The criminal who reaches his unique pleasure during the act of confession is a type well known to students , amateur and professional , of the human personality . Crime may be his only means of expressingaffinity with , love of , the race . The police are ever eager to collaborate in such an effort , not being a punitivep226agency . The police apprehend , catch , seize , arrest ; they do not keep ; and only the courts may punish . Tierney reminded himself of these truths , for he suffered much from a memory of his irresponsibility with Betty . But now his seemingly uncontrolled outburst had been preceded by deliberation . He resented being selected to hear Detweiler 's confession ; that the killer 's request had been honored by the D.A . was unbearable . Tierney had not capturedDetweiler . If anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , Tierney , was the prisoner of a politicianand a murderer . He must show Detweiler that any further display of vanitywas out of the question . Detweiler said : " I knew you were the only one with guts or pride . But I do n't know whether those who do n't have it can be condemned . It may be essentially the ability to resist distractions , and speaking for myself , I am so easily distractedthat I have achieved very little . Listening to your estimate of me , I had to agree with you . Except that I have assaulted lots of people , not just women or men who I caught unawares . I fight a lot , but there 's nothing personal in it . Of course , that may be even less admirable than your idea , but I did want to point it out . " " Have you killed anybody else ? " " I do n't know , " Detweiler said . " I certainly do n't fight people with the plan of killing them . I can tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fighting unless somewhere in the back of your mind is a knowledge that life is always at stake . But the other person , being human , knows that too , so it is fair . " He thought a moment and added : " Of course , you will find people who pretend otherwise . " " Fight ? " said Tierney . " Is that your name for it ? When thep227other person is a woman ? Why do n't you admit you like to beat up girls , to hurt them : the more pain they have , the more your kicks . They are soft and you are hard . You can prove you 're a man then , striking something stiff against something that gives . Otherwise you would n't know . " " I do n't fight with the other person in mind at all , " Detweileranswered . " That 's what I mean by its being impersonal . I 'm thinking exclusively of myself at such times , and they get in the way . You may be correct when you say I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trapped in details though my aim is universality . But so far as sex goes , I am so normal in that area I have tried repeatedly to get rid of my penis . " Tierney tried to ignore the statement ; he had no use for it ; but Detweiler persisted . " I have never been able to accomplishthat . So you are right about my being yellow . I took a razor blade in my right hand , and my organ in the left , and I started to make a cut down at the root . Puncturingthe skin was n't painful , a razor blade is so sharp , so I got in inserted all right , but when I reached  --  " Tierney shoved his chair back and walked rapidly to the barred window . Because of his work many men must have stood , must be standing , in a similar attitude in various places of confinement . Necessarily he always minimized the discomforts of prisons , doubted their adequacy as punishment  --  if that Chinatown mugger had , in the course of robbing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have got as little as twenty years of three nourishing meals per day , Saturday night movies , Sunday baseball games , payment for making license plates in the prison factory , not to mention training by masters in his true vocation , against the day he would escape or be paroled . But now Tierneyp228understood that if he himself ever committed a punishable crime he must lose his life before capture : he could not endure constraint . Detweiler , however , seemed not to mind ; he was insane . He was not faking in his description of the attempted mutilation . Tierney could feel its authenticityin his own groin , he who sometimes came naked from the shower to lather his face over the basin , to wet the razor , but never to lift it before he had hung a towel from his waist . Detweiler was saying , with his boyish grimace : " Gee , it really hurt ! So I stopped . Believe me , it is an awful thing to try to cut off your penis . It is terrible . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor catastrophe : flat soda , term paper . If degeneration this was , it must be a subtle form , too fine for Tierney to distinguish . He could see that Detweiler was serious , and as a fellow man , even one who had never attemptedit , he must affirm that self-mutilation would be painful . One knew that as a basic truth . Being mad , Detweilerhad to test it for himself . Tierney formulated a definitionfor a maniac : he who accepts nothing on faith , a kind of scientist of the soul . But an obvious question remained . " Why ? " Detweiler repeated , but not rhetorically . He seemed to do nothing for effect . He was the only suspect Tierney had ever interrogated whose response could not be called a performance . " I suppose more vital energy is lost by that route than by any of the other orifices , certainly any but the mouth . " Now , I am aware of the theory that sexuality is initiated in the mind , and not the organs , but remove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Take a bullp229and make him an ox and you will see he loses his aggressive character but none of his strength . " So the idea was far from ridiculous . What was lacking was courage on my part . I really do n't like pain , and it seems pointless to inflict it on oneself in this day and age when anesthetic surgery is practiced everywhere . So I got into the habit if I would pass a municipal clinic of going in and making my request . But I 'll tell you this : I never found a doctor who would do it . So I continued to lose a lot of force constantly . You know how you often wake up in the morning with a physical craving for sex which has come from nowhere , or riding a subway , not even looking at women , and your organ is suddenly in a ready state , intruding into your thoughts , which may be of an entirely abstract nature . This has led me to consider whether sex really has anything to do with people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you know that the common ant experiences sexual desire only once in a lifetime ? That bears some thought , especially since like human beings ants are social creatures and build great cities , structures , roads , fight wars , and there is reason to believe even have a sort of politics . I do n't care much for those ant colonies that you can buy already made up , though : encased in glass and with tiny manmade buildings labeled School ' and Church ' and Town Hall . " ' Tierney had once as a boy read a science-fiction story in which the entire world as we know it was but a drop of water on the slide of a colossal microscope . Hurricanes and earthquakes were caused by the probing of the massivepersonage who operated the instrument . His eye was the sun.  |p230Tierney  still stood at the barred window , looking through which he now saw , across the areaway , a lighted office , a detective he knew on the Safe &; Loft Squad . They were alwaysbusiest at night , obviously the optimum time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businessman in trouble . Tierney had no difficulty in making the immediate transition from fantasy to such a routine recognition . Lawrenson , the Safe &; Loft man , had just made first-grade detective . Tierney was not up for promotion , had been only nine months in second-grade . Lawrenson had been on the Force for years and years and was at least a decade older than Tierney ; his upgrading had been long overdue . Tierney did not feel any sense of injustice , but Shuster would have . Shuster had been a lieutenant since Christ was a patrolman  --  anexpression of his own . He resented every promotion , even Tierney 's though he had recommended Tierney for it , and he had some dirt on everybody . Shuster would know for example that Lawrenson had , two years before , bought an eight-room house costing much more than he could afford , both in down payment and monthly installments . Shuster knew all the grafters , the sadists , the adulterers ; undoubtedly he had a thing or two on the D.A. , and perhaps even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was the interesting thing to Tierney . Shuster stayed a lieutenant . Meanwhile there sat Detweiler , the ultimate criminal , the man who Tierney was willing to believe had murdered for no motive at all . And Tierney had his back turned to him . It had been preposterous for the commissioner to take away his gun . Tierney was certain that lethal instruments were irrelevant , in Detweiler 's view.  |p231He  turned and asked : " How did you happen to use a screwdriver on Appleton ? " " Is n't that something ? " said Detweiler . " I never knew what his name was until you people here began to use it . To me he was just a man . I had left Mrs. Starr and Billie in the bedroom and was walking slowly along the hall towards the living room when his radio suddenly stopped playing . I guess it was his radio , because it had been playing in the room I used to rent when I lived there and the door had been ajar all the while , though I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the hallway . And I did n't want to know , because it was deafening and loud noise always makes me want to kill the person who is making it , and I did n't go there to get into a fight . " So by the time I reached the living room the effect of the beautiful stillness came over me , and I stopped to enjoy it . I did n't have any place to go and so was in no hurry . You have no idea how sweet it was there in the absolute quiet : inanimate objects are at their best in the silence . There was one lamp on a table near the windows and its soft light made the fabric of the sofa look like velvet , and I had never before noticed that the shadows made a pattern on the carpet that undoubtedly had a significant meaning could one have read it . When you speak of nothingness in any area it is often only because of insufficient knowledge . Everything is teeming with life . I 'm convinced of that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he cast a shadow , he contained or consumed it . He was portable in every sense of the word , with no excess , leaving no mark . He was almost nothing but mind or spirit , and that was warped . He was worthless . Yet Tierney listened with a peculiar sympathy . Det/weiler 's view of things had a logic of its own : if you accepteda loud radio as sufficient motive for killing , then you must also admit the sense in enjoying the shadows on a carpet . Consistency is a value which the sane must support in ordinary circumstances ; all the more so when consorting with the disorderly . But Tierney , who had seen those bluefaced , tongue-biting , distended-eyed corpses of Mrs. Starr and Billie , the worst of murders , far worse than when the mortifying body is broken and can shed its blood  --  in gunshotand knife murders , the victim loses some of his corporeality ; strangled , his gain is horrible  --  Tierney also marveled at Detweiler 's facility in making transitions . " How long did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know ! Time did not apply . Funny , I had been trying for years to bring time to a stop and never succeeded . Oh , I could slow it up some . Everybody knows that time goes fast when you eat delicious food or make love or engage in any entertaining or attractivepastime . And slowly if you do n't care for what you are doing . But take a swallow of strawberry milk shake and try to hold it  --  I do n't mean the actual fluid but the exquisite sensation of sweet and fruit and smooth and mellow and slippery and cool in one instant retained infinitely , or let go and then summoned back next day or week or year . " Detweilerwas radiant . " My God , would n't that be wonderful ? " He fell back into the chair . " We have it all , but lose it , let it go , proceed to the next phenomenon , distracted by what seem to be successive promises . " " Appleton entered the room while you were looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . " Obviously he did , " said Detweiler , shrugging . " I was aware that he was saying something , perhaps not wordsp233but sounds . I suppose now that he had seen Billie , anyway , whom I had left on the bed . I had put Mrs. Starr underneath , because I did n't want Billie to be upset by the sight when she came in , and  --  " " Where was Billie while you were strangling Mrs. Starr ? " Detweiler said : " I want to follow the line I 'm on at the moment . Ca n't you see I am developing a point , and furthermore , one which you got me started on by asking about Appleton ? " Tierney , pulling at his lips , accepted the rebuke and , his claustrophobia was thereby diminished . Detweiler 's insistence on arranging his own kind of order made him more feasible as a companion in a locked room . Tierney returned to the chair opposite the murderer , turned it back to front , and straddled the seat , folding his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeded . " It gradually dawned on me that someone else was in the room and not in sympathy with me , so that time was starting up again , slowly and uncertainly at first , as when you pick up a clock that has wound down and begin to tighten the mainspring , tock . . . tick . . . tock-tick , tock , tick , ticktock , ticktockticktockticktock ! I turned around and saw this man , rather large and baldheaded . He was making sounds that I could not distinguish , and they did not seem to be synchronized with the movements of his lips . " Well , it was rather embarrassing . I said , I 'm Joe Detweiler . I used to live here , in the same room that you have . ' I walked towards him and put out my right hand . He was trembling but looked friendly . He put his hand out , but as I was about to shake it , I saw he was holding a screwdriver in it . I said , What 's this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a cold but understandably : Fiddling with the radio.  |p234Station  knob loose ; tiny screw . ' He said pathetically : This screwdriver has too big a blade . ' " I thought what he needed was one of those screwdriver sets in which ever smaller blades are fitted one into the next , and all nestle in the handle of the biggest , underneath a metal cap . You unfasten the cap and shake out one after the other until finally you can go no farther and you have a delicate little blade that will fit even the tiny screws in a wristwatch . " However , I did n't tell him that . I remembered how loudly he had been playing the radio while I was talking to Mrs. Starr . I said : You should have consideration for other people . Do n't you know that sound can kill ? ' This is true , and has been done in laboratories with white rats and guinea pigs , and is n't it terrible that living animals should be destroyed to prove what everybody knows in his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or immoral , but people who make noise are insensitive , deadened by the repeated impact of molecules of sound . " " So , " said Tierney , " you had given your name to Appleton , and realizing he would identify you , you killed him with his own screwdriver . " " Not quite , " said Detweiler . " You know how different actualexperience is from any speculation about it , and even a description by a participant , for that matter . That is what makes Realization difficult : it is definitely not memory . In fact , memory obstructs and perverts the process , for we all have our selfish interests to serve in the ordinary recollection . For example , I am trying now with the best of my ability to remember what happened with Appleton . " Tierney of course was trying to get Detweiler to admitP235that the murder of Appleton had been premeditated , even if for half a minute . He said : " But you did tell him your name . " " Yes , I am positive of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive as one can be of anything of a phenomenal nature . " " And he found the bodies . Did he accuse you of killing the women ? " " That he had seen Billie is really speculation on my part . I do n't know that he did , nor do I know that if he saw her lying on the bed he would recognize that the life had gone out of her . He might think she was sleeping . " " Naked ? " asked Tierney . " Oh , Billie was frequently naked . She was a great one for forgetting to close doors . She was a lot like an animal in having no sense of shame about her body . If you lived there you certainly had lots of opportunities to see everything she had , but speaking of myself , I have never been terribly interested in ogling from the sexual point of view . In sex I want to get as close as possible to the center . Lookingkeeps you outside , confines you to yourself . " But supposing he did get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him what his own name was and he did n't answer . He did not accuse me of anything . He just stood there . I said : Merry Christmas , then . ' He nodded , smiling slightly , I thought . I turned to leave and he jumped me . But I do n't think he was a treacherous man . I believe that it had taken him that long to move into action , and that he would have attacked at that moment regardless of whether my back was turned or anything else . He was strong and brave , but I think confused.  | " I would not say he was trying to kill me . " " So , " said Tierney , " then it was not self-defense . " He was obliged as a police officer to seek out the truth as to an allegedbreach of the law . Whether a suspect was legally guilty or innocent was not his affair . Yet in practice , which is to say morality , he was gratified only by what tended to incriminate . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animosity he had felt towards Detweiler . You can not hate a man who has no pride  --  no , that was imprecise : rather who has another kind of pride . Detweiler was mad , but not without a method . Detweiler shook his head . " I would say he wanted to detain me . He did not understand what had happened , and it is almost impossible to kill a human being  --  always exceptingthe case of pure accident  --  when you are confused as to your motive and theirs . " " And that also applies to you , " said Tierney . " You were not confused when you killed these three persons . You knew what you wanted to do , had thought it out , planned it , and did it . Now all you have to tell me is your motive , and we can get a good night 's sleep . " Detweiler answered sadly : " I asked to talk to you because I believed that alone among the people with whom I have come into contact since entering the newspaper office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought you were terribly intelligent , but mind , in itself , is inconsequential . But now you are willfully placing yourself in obstruction , to the end that , if you had your way , I would confess to murder , pointlessly . " Now , I will do that for you , if you truly want it and it is not merely a nervous reflex . All I ask is that you bep237serious  --  I do n't mean solemn , you can laugh or joke , but for God 's sake accept responsibility . " Tierney was not caught off guard by this impassioned statement . He had expected it , had indeed tried to provoke it , and now believed he had scored another gain . He had got Detweiler to come out of moral hiding , to acknowledge if only in a negative way the crime of which he was accused . Detweiler understood the charge against him , could differentiate between right and wrong . Whatever the features of his madness , no other issue was germane to this inquiry . " Do you confess to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one of them ? " Tierney asked compulsively . Detweiler said , in a rush of anger : " Do you want me to ? " " I do n't come into this , " Tierney said . Then he heard himself add , inappropriately : " I am not charged with anything . " The personal pronoun disturbed him . " That 's right , " Detweiler said . " I 'm certainly not accusing you . " " Why did you do that ? " cried Tierney . Detweiler looked alarmed and puzzled . " Excuse me ? " " Put that funny twist on the word I. Are you getting cute with me ? " Tierney was jumping with nerves . Without any adjustment , Detweiler resumed : " The reasonI believe he wanted to detain or retain me was : he grabbed my shoulder . If he had wanted to kill me he obviouslycould have done so with most hope of success when my back was turned . " He grabbed my shoulder and pulled me around . I tried to put him at ease about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , Yes , I killed them , if that is what you are in doubt about . ' Detweiler shrugged . " Then we began to wrestle . The reason I do n't say we fought , at that point , is that there seemed to be more the spirit of a game about it than a lifeand-deathstruggle . You know , each was trying to best the other , not to destroy him , for there would be no contest if either were eliminated from the competition . He would get a hammerlock on me , I would finally break it . I would have him in a sort of half-nelson , he would struggle free , and so on . Though we were not wrestling in any formal sense , so the holds were far from classic . . . . I can demonstrate , if you like . " Detweiler started up , but Tierney , his defenses rising more swiftly , ordered him back . It would be no game were he to touch Detweiler . " O.K. , " Detweiler said goodnaturedly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it was not an insolent movement , and Tierney took no offense . He said : " But all during this game , this sport , you were trying to get hold of the screwdriver . " " Nope , " said Detweiler . " The screwdriver had fallen to the floor and was just lying there . Neither one of us was interested in it : we could not have cared less about it ! " " Then how did it end up in Appleton ? " " Ah yes , " said Detweiler . " Obligations come with knowledge . Had I not known Appleton was alive and present in that apartment , I would have left . But in possession of the facts , I had no alternative but to finish out the pattern . Havingkilled the other two residents , I could not abandon him to loneliness . I had to clean it up . Otherwise it would havep239been a disgusting mess for him . On Christmas Eve . I never could have forgiven myself for leaving him with that . " So I snatched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as he lunged . I used both hands , plus his momentum , and the combination was enough to penetrate his temple , but that is solid bone there , seizing the blade and tearing it from my hands as he fell . In telling you this for your purposes , I am compressing the experience . In your irritable mood , your nervous chronological captivity , I am really reluctant to mention the extraordinary feature . " Tierney gave a cop 's shrug . " Rely on me , " he said . " For what ? " " Oh , for Christ 's sake . " Tierney swiveled his head about . " It strikes me , " said Detweiler , " that the standard interrogationis designed to conceal or suppress the truth . " " Believe me when I say this is n't the standard type , but you may he right anyway , " Tierney said literally , patiently , as if he were speaking to Mr. Average Citizen , whose taxes paid his salary . Occasionally , for relief he had to pretend Detweiler was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe he is innocent . Or if he has confessed he tries to explain why he committedthe crime . He tries to associate himself , as best he can , with normal behavior . Everybody gets mad , everybody has moments when he is out of control , everybody at times breaks the law . " " They do ? " asked Detweiler , marvelously , and Tierney could see he was not faking . " You 're not saying that to trick me , are you ? " " I would n't lie to you , Joseph . " " I 'm sorry I was difficult about the chop suey , " Det/weiler said . " It was nothing personal . I got to thinking it over , and it just did n't seem right to eat if we were having this talk . I should have explained that , but you were posing as unfriendly at the appropriate moment . " " That 's right , it was just a pretense , " said Tierney . " You tell me anything you want . I wo n't make fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . I do n't mind being ridiculed ; I just ca n't stand not being listened to . " " That 's why you killed Mrs. Starr , was n't it ? " Detweiler struck his hands together . " I told you that we , you and I , had an affinity , did I not ! This is great ! . . . Of course , of course , you understand perfectly . " Detweiler puthis hands on the edge of the table . " Do you mind if I get up ? " " Go ahead . " Detweiler began to stride about in the suit that was too large for him . Yet to Tierney he did not look pathetic . Reaching the window and reversing , his wide cuffs sweeping the floor , Detweiler said : " I am excited by the possibilities of our association . Since we 're both men , sex is n't a factor . That was the trouble with Betty as a partner . She was a woman , and that could not be ignored al-together . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? " " Certainly . But you know it all now that we are in alignment , so let 's not waste any more energy on the matter . We have a job to do which , accomplished , will place these things in perspective . " " What is that ? " Tierney asked in earnest , for despite his apparent disingenuousness , his sudden assumption of the familiar , avuncular style of the routine interrogator who has won a suspect 's confidence , he was authentically naivep241now , else he could not have produced involuntarily the accuratestatement of Detweiler 's motive . He could not explainhis clairvoyance except by use of Detweiler 's theory : thay had some profound though unreasonable link . Detweiler said : " To kill Time . "  |p242DETWEILER  CONTINUED : " People use that expression negligently , in reference to the interval between what they believeto be important phases of experience . Between the end of the workday and dinner , they kill time . Sunday is ideal for killing time in this sense , which signifies idleness , quiescence , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if active , engaged perhaps in a game the outcome of which is inconsequential : solitaire , for example , the winner and loser of which are both yourself . " A waste of time , in the conscious opinion of most , who would not be so occupied if they had a task , but they do not say waste ' : they say kill . ' Very interesting . The alternativeto killing is using . Time is used to arrest criminals , to print newspapers , and so on . Time is killed by playing games , but not if the players are professionals ; or gazing at trees , but not if the observer is a botanist.  | " I did not use Mrs. Starr or Billie or Appleton . I killed them . As I am not a professional killer , I was also killing Time . " " Then killing them was a game ? " asked Tierney . " Yes , but one like solitaire or ticktacktoe if played byyourself : there was no personal winning or losing . " " By you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They lost their lives . " " Certainly it must seem that way to someone who believes life can be won or lost , " Detweiler said , leaning on two hands at the end of the table . " Like the district attorney , and the commissioner of police , and the older man who accompanied us on the flight . But not to you and me , and not to Mrs. Starr , Billie , and Mr. Appleton . " " You can speak for them ? " Tierney terminated this with the accent of interrogation , though he knew there was no question in Detweiler 's mind . " Because , having killed them , I possess them , " said Detweiler . " And they me . They are in me and with me , and I of them and with them . And now I shall be executed becauseof you , and we all shall be part of you . " Tierney apologized . He said : " I do not understand . " Detweiler smiled helpfully . " I 'm going to confess to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that for me ? " " Not for you , " said Detweiler . " You will see that it is not exactly a reward , though to superficial minds like those of your superiors it may seem an accomplishment . I say becauseof you , because you are capable , because you will accept responsibility for the lives you incorporate . You are not a frivolous individual by any means . " Tierney said softly : " Forget about that , Joseph . "  | " The advantage is that you have a profession , " Detweiler said , " and a special kind : you regulate and control . Exactly what is needed , lacking which I have not made the progress I should have . " " Joseph , I am not your partner or collaborator in anything . You must understand that . I am not , believe me for your own sake . Do you understand ? I am a police officer , and what you tell me can be used against you , so you want to be very sure it is the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting and maybe even brilliantat times  --  they are not appropriate here . I am not a priest . I do not have the right nor , to be frank , the competenceto deal with these other matters . You 'll get the opportunity to speak with a spiritual adviser , a minister or priest . Save your ideas for him . " Tierney paused , then added bluffly , to take the pressure off : " Hell , I 'm not worthy of these high-powered concepts . I am just a cop . " " If you want to be simplistic , " said Detweiler , " then I am just a killer , and Billie and her mother and Appleton are just corpses and already rotting , and God is just a despot . " " God ? " asked Tierney . " That 's the first time you have mentioned God . " " It could be the last , " Detweiler said matter-of-factly . He rolled his head about and , lowering his chest to touch the end of the table , did a few standing pushups . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I try to keep from being vulgar . Suffice it to say that you and I can do without the name , so long as we have the power . " Tierney was embarrassed , and asked a sophomoric question . " Do you believe in God ? " Detweiler did a pushup . He looked at Tierney with what seemed to be amusement , and said : " You can be prettyp245crafty . I 'd certainly hate to be interrogated by you if I were a criminal . " Tierney sighed and collected himself . He said : " Joseph , do you really think we 're getting anywhere ? I put it to you . You 're an intelligent fellow . Are n't we wasting our time ? Now , you told Mr. Crews you were ready to make a statement , so we cooperated with you . But it 's getting later and later , and the rest of us have n't had any sleep since last night . Frankly , I do n't think you 're being considerate . " " More than once you have used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just want to tell you , " said Detweiler , " that I never doubt your sincerity . No need to reassure me . I trust you completely , no matter what it seems you are doing at the moment . " There was an implication here that Tierney did not like . Before he could protest , however , Detweiler had intuited his reaction . " I mean , " said Detweiler , " that though it might seem as if you are trying to distract me right now , I 'm ignoring it . I know you are testing me . " " For what ? " " To see whether I 'll break under the strain . One has to be careful when choosing an associate for dangerous work . Think of the mountain climber who must trust the comrades who share his lifeline . One can not survive if the other is capricious or forgetful or has an uncontrollably humorous turn of mind , though a direct sense of enjoyment is all to the good . I can assure you that I am seldom very witty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tierney said seriously . " But supposingI promise to talk over these philosophical or religious problems with you at a later time . Can we make a deal ? Right now you will stick to the facts about what happenedp246on Christmas Eve at the Starr apartment . No interpretationsor abstract stuff , O.K. ? " " That , " said Detweiler , " is a distinction I find hard to make . Between fact ' and idea . ' But I will do my best , and if I get off the track , please let me know . " " Another thing : should n't we get a stenographer in here so this can be taken down and you wo n't have to go through it again for the record ? " " Matter and mind , " Detweiler went on . " Their connectionis Time . " " Joseph , " said Tierney , " you are off the track . " Detweiler shook his head . " You know , " he said , " it 's a funny thing , but the rare occasion on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track , the world invariably pulls me away . Even you do it , with the best of intentions . Betty always did , too . I would simply give up but for one thing : I know I 'm right . It can not be that all experience passes away forever , beyond recall . " He struck the tabletop . " That is unthinkable . If it is so , then there goes your law , Tierney . Your profession is meaningless , then , and you are an idiot . " At the moment it seemed to Tierney a realistic appraisal of himself and his job . What point would be served by aiding in Detweiler 's conviction ? If he were so disposed of that he could not kill again , there would yet be other murderers , rational or insane  --  another meaningless distinction , along with life or death , fact or idea . Since all men would die anyway , a murderer took nothing essential from his victim but time . If Detweiler believed he could stop time , he must believe he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a baggy suit . Tierney asked him : " Joseph , are you God ? "  | " Yes , " said Detweiler . Then : " But that should n't bother you . You are too , if you want to be . " " And Mrs. Starr and Billie and Appleton ? " " Certainly . " " Then how could you have killed them ? " " Exactly , " said Detweiler . He returned to his chair . " You understand thoroughly . " Detweiler believed everybody was God , but Tierney had had too much of religion in his schooling to be anything but a practical atheist . Tierney recognized that this distinctionwas much greater than that between criminal and cop . Under the appropriate conditions he could see himself strangling Betty , but he could never accept a connection betweenhumanity and divinity . " Well , " said Detweiler , " now that we 've got that settled , why do n't you call in the stenographer ? " Tierney opened the door and asked the uniformed men to come in . Without looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room where the D.A . and the otherswaited amid clouds of cigarette and pipe smoke . Mr. Crews held a blond briar between his incisors . He had taken off his jacket , exposing the embroidered initials on the breast pocket of the white shirt and the full length of his bluefiguredtie . He looked at Tierney . He wasted no show on subordinates ; it was self-evident that the occasion was momentous , else he would not have been there at all . He was unassailable ; Detweiler would not have chosen him as confidant . Tierney was aware of many pairs of eyes as he spoke to Crews , belonging to as many superiors ; the commissioner , a few captains , Shuster , detectives on the D.A . ' s staff . It was his moment.  | " Sir , " he stated to Crews , " I 'm afraid I ca n't come up with anything . He might want to talk , but what he says is psycho malarkey , like the stuff he gave the newspaper . " Crews sucked his pipe , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowl ; he could managesuch an expression without being absurd . Yet he was not a genuine pipe smoker : the pipe was much too blond . He said : " Tierney , I wish you would not use the word psycho , ' or any similar terms , in referring to this individual . I intend to have him indicted , and to try him for , Murder One . I do n't care whether he gibbers like an ape or eats his own excrement . I do n't care how many noted alienists Melrosebrings into court to assure us that the defendant is as incapable of moral decision as a chipmunk . I am going to hold him legally responsible for his actions , and I am going to get a conviction . We all have our quirks . You overlook mine as I overlook yours , and as we will all overlook Joseph Detweiler 's . " " Yes sir , " said Tierney . " I suppose he is trying to make fools of us . " He did not feel he was selling Detweiler out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " A routine type , " drawled Crews , around the hard-rubber bit between his teeth . " Thank you , Tierney . " He spoke to two of his own men , Detectives Hatfield and Speyer , as Tierneyfaded away into the corner where Shuster stood . " Well , " said Tierney , " I tried . " " Did you touch him ? " Shuster asked . " No . " " You are a stupid son of a bitch , " Shuster whispered . Hatfield and Speyer went to the interrogation room . They were not huge men , yet both were fit and larger than Det/weiler . Tierney believed that the killer would hold out more stubbornly with every blow he received . Tierney was wrong . By morning the D.A . had a complete statement of the approved type , in which Detweiler confessed to the premeditated murder of not only Billie Starr , but Appleton as well . Tierney assumed that Detweiler had broken under the punishment ; that the prior symptoms of madness with which he , Tierney , had been confronted had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under when he faced the D.A . ' s men , who were efficient and unreflective . Tierney made this assumption because it was his duty so to do , and it did not alter his private judgment that Detweiler was insane . Tierney saw no conflict here : he was very normal . It never for a moment occurred to him that Detweiler assumed he had sent Hatfield and Speyer to take the confessionwhich Detweiler understood he and Tierney had agreed on ; just as to Detweiler the thought did not occur that Tierney had betrayed him . Detweiler rarely thought the worst of anybody . He felt no animosity towards Hatfield and Speyer for punching him around some before it became clear he was not resisting them . The D.A . ' s men of course shared Tierney 's belief that they had beaten a statement out of Detweiler , and felt a sense of achievement . Detweiler did not know about this ; but it is probable that if he had known , he would have done nothing to set them straight , interested as he was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken to the line-up : a brightly lighted stage at the end of a room that resembled a gymnasium , a man on a nearby platform , anp250audience . A number of other persons were assembled behind the stage , but Detweiler was sent out first . He had had some sleep after giving and signing his statement , in a neat little cell furnished with all that a man might need : bunk , toilet , washstand . He had eaten quite a nice breakfast of oatmeal and coffee with sugar and milk , and there was plentiful hot water , soap and a clean towel . He understood he was supposed to get a uniform , but had not received it so far , and his shirt being soiled around the neckband , he washed only the collar and squeezed it in the towel , then smoothed and stretched it in his fingers . It was still damp and felt cool , refreshing , around his throat , which was still somewhat sore at the adam 's apple from having been seized by one of the men who took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Joe ? " But he no longer remembered the bruises he had sustained in the saloon encounter with Walt . On the stage his situation was noteworthy . Because of the lights he seemed utterly alone , that is , though he knew the room was thronged he could see no one . The joke was on him , who during one phase had experimented with processesfor making himself invisible , which he had proved was impossible unless everyone else was blinded , but of course here was the secret : concentrated light . If one could travel within an incandescence ... . The man on the platform read aloud a brief account of how Detweiler happened to be there , and then he said , kindly : " Turn around , Joe . " Detweiler did so and studied the horizontal lines on the wall , which demarcated certain heights , and then the man said : " O.K. , Joe , you can face front again . " Detweiler came around , smiling at the thought of his supervisibilityin the brilliant lights , against a white wall grad/uated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorough job ; they were specialists in recognition and identification ; in their hands one felt established , on record , in place . " Think this is funny , do you , Joe ? Joe strangles women , but when the boys come to play , little Joey runs away , " said the platform man . Detweiler had no idea why this man was perverting the facts , but since his voice was kind , malice was out of the question . " No , " he said , " I also killed Appleton , though he was neither a boy nor came out to play , exactly . " " And you are proud of it , right , Joe ? Is your face somewhatbruised , Joe ? Look over this way . How 'd that happen ? " " A fellow in a bar , a couple of nights ago , hit me . " " Uh-huh , " said the platform man . " How have you been treated in police custody ? " " Fine , " said Detweiler . " Swell . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad time ? " " Certainly not . " Detweiler saw no reason to get those fellowswho succeeded Tierney in trouble , though they had struck him a few times , but in the middle of the body and not the face , and probably through misunderstanding ; and besides , his questioner , being a policeman , would know of this and not have to ask him . " Joe has made a statement to the district attorney , " said his questioner to the invisible audience . " All right , Joe . That 's all . " " Thank you , " said Detweiler . " Do n't mention it . " Next Detweiler was taken to be arraigned , which was to say , formally charged with having committed certain ac/tions which were criminal according to the laws of the state . Everything having to do with Law was carefully managed , he could see . After experiencing this at close hand , Detweilerdoubted that justice often miscarried . He had by now repeated several times an admission of responsibility for the three deaths , but apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police , the district attorney , and Homicide Court , where he was at present , with the grand jury , he had been told , yet to come . In the house of exterior reality were many mansions to occupy , categories to satisfy , persons with a job to do . Man had made a remarkablestructure of mechanical morality . Detweiler however could not let himself get too involved in these matters . Thus he was happy to meet the square-built , well-dressed individualwho approached him in a hallway of the court . " Are you Joseph Detweiler ? My name is Melrose . " " Really delighted to meet you , " Detweiler said , eagerly lifting his right hand but , inhibited by the quick restraint of the handcuff around that wrist joined to Tierney , who as the arresting officer was obliged to accompany Detweiler on all formal occasions , dropped it and put out the other . Melrose made no attempt to take it , from which Detweiler could see immediately that he was a man of propriety and spurned the unnatural : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were one-armed , perhaps not even then ! Detweiler liked such classic ways . He also noticed that Melrose failed to acknowledge Tierney at all . Detweiler said no more to the attorney until Tierney unlockedhim from the cuff and left him and Melrose in a little interrogation-cell behind the courtroom . Detweiler said : " The newspaper publisher told me youp253were the best defense counsel in the country . Would you mind telling me how old you are ? " " I 'll be fifty in June . " " You may think this is an impertinent question , " said Detweiler , " but I wonder if you 'd mind telling me how long you think you 'll live , until what age , I mean . " " I do n't mind the question , " Melrose answered , " but I do n't have a response to it , because I have never thought about the matter  --  no , that 's not precisely true . Of course I have , but not in that way . " " Then I guess you and I will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Detweiler . " Frankly , I would n't trust you if you got statistical on me . " " Frankly , " said Melrose , " I do n't care whether you trust me or not . " Detweiler had difficulty in ascertaining the spirit in which the lawyer had made the statement , Melrose 's expression being impenetrable . He said : " Could you clarify that ? " " Surely . I am your counsel . I am not you . I will speak for you and not of you . I am accused of no crime , and I will not be on trial . You are , and will be . That is the difference between us , and it is important to remember at all times . If I take the case  --  as I am apparently doing , because I am here  --  we will share a common interest : you want to live and I want to win . Neither of us can do damage to the other withoutharming his own cause . Trust plays no part at all . " Detweiler listened carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attire . The lawyer wore a medium-gray suit , pin-striped in a darker gray . On sitting down he had unfastened the middle button of his jacket and plucked up his trousers at both knees . His cufflinks werep254large , flat ovals of silver , engraved in an exotic design ; his collar pin a narrow silver bar . His pocket handkerchief was a cloudlike puff of linen . The vest was a surprise : dove-gray , unstriped , with opalescent buttons , and of a fabric somewherebetween felt and velvet . A tie of silver grillwork over an intense blue , rising to a huge knot at the white collar of the silken shirt whose body was , however , pink , an effect which Detweiler could see on closer inspection was due to the tight intermixture of red threads with white . " Is there egg on my vest ? " asked Melrose . " I was just interested in your shirt , " said Detweiler . " I imagine it was special-made , for you alone . " " That is true . " Melrose slowly lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass ? " " Sorry , " said Detweiler . " I did not mean to imply I was giving you a test . I admire your taste in clothing as well as your brilliance in argument . I am beginning to appreciate your gifts . " Melrose showed the saddest smile Detweiler had ever seen . He said : " I have n't finished on the subject of trust . " " Quite all right , " Detweiler said . " I know that in your professionyou have to protect yourself with cynicism , being the middleman between crime and punishment . Your clients are by definition morally inferior to the rest of humanity , and are on trial for doing things that you , yourself , would never even be suspected of . To speak for them requires great irony on your part , but there must be an even greater irony that nobody understands but yourself . I mean , I suppose people tend to think of you as something of a criminal if you defend criminals , and those you defend think of you as being ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , youp255must wonder whether you chose the profession because of compassion or cruelty . " Melrose stayed sad . He said : " You have not retained me to study my motives , Joseph , however more valuable that may be than any jurisprudence . My sole importance to you is that perhaps I can save your life . " Detweiler was astonished that even such a man as Melrosecould be utterly naive . " But I do n't want to save my life ! " he exclaimed . " That 's not the point at all . I have killed three persons , and I must pay for the crime . " An unprecedented animation showed in Melrose , whom , until this moment , Detweiler would have described as merely bland , impeccable . Now his face began to take on the hue of his rosy shirt . " Pay whom ? " he cried . " I do n't know ! " Detweiler shouted back . " You tell me . You 're a lawyer . " " I 'm your lawyer . " Melrose shrugged in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow and had a feeling that to apologizewould make it worse . " Listen here , " he said , " I do n't mean to diminish your role in my trial . I just wanted to be honest and let you know that I do n't have any quarrel with the Law . If you can find any legal justification for my having killed those people , more power to you . I ca n't see any , but then I am not a lawyer . " Melrose said : " Will you let me worry about that ? Now we must go into court for your arraignment , and a statement of charges against you will be read , and then you must plead either one way or the other . "  | " Guilty or not ? Which do you think I am , Mr. Melrose ? " The attorney shook his heavy head . " Joe , what you are is not relevant . What concerns us is what you can be proved to be in a court of law . That is a highly technical matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : in bringing a charge against you , your accuser takes on the burden of proof . You may accept this silently and make no defense whatever  --  which is in itself a defense . " " I have considered doing just that , " said Detweiler , " but it does n't seem right . I do n't think the State would spend all their time and money and the energy of their employes if there was n't a good reason . And in this case , we know the accusation is justified . I certainly killed three people . The only doubt is whether it was murder . I think I should explain it was not , from my point of view , because the differencebetween killing and murder is that malice is present in the latter . I have previously spoken of gain , ' in the sense that I got none from these killings , having in mind robbery , vengeance , and so on . But I have to admit I was being deceitful , even to myself , when I made that assertion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have said what if anything in his counsel'sattitudes was genuine and what was lawyerly craft . To be another man 's advocate required a peculiar type of personality . He had been amazed by Melrose 's professed lack of interest in the real , as opposed to the legal , issues in the killings , yet now , only a moment later , the lawyer seemed intent . Detweiler had been much more at ease with Tierney . " Do you really want to hear this ? " he asked . " Of course , " said Melrose . " Your mention of silence  --  how the accused can defendp257himself silently  --  suggested this new interpretation , and the more I think about it , the more likely it sounds . You see , Mrs. Starr was making noise . The shouting did not bother me because at least it was personal . She wanted me to leave and not to wait for Betty to arrive . She made that clear . I tried to explain , but she would n't listen . She went into the kitchen and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of crockery , unlike any other in the world , piercing , jagged , white , searing , the noise of almostbreakage , never-quite , a cold sound , icy , ice sheets pounding together in the Bering Sea  --  " " Joe , " said Melrose . " We must get into court . " " I went into the kitchen and begged her to put those plates down . She was banging them so loudly she could not hear me . Those plates were driving her crazy ; they were getting their chance at long last to get revenge for years of abuse . Do n't kid yourself , " Detweiler told Melrose as if confidentially , " material objects are aware of us at all times , rocks and stumps as well as sophisticated devices , but luckilythey are all at odds with one another or people would long since be overwhelmed . " Melrose said : " Come on , Joe . Your ideas are not terribly original . The revolt of the machines against their human masters is one of the oldest cliches in science-fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am saying , is it ? " said Detweiler . " Anyway , I 'm not trying to be creative , I 'm telling you what happened . I expect most of it will be an old story to a man in your job , defending killers as you do . " " You killed Mrs. Starr to stop the noise ? " " Yes , so you see , I did gain . I gained silence . " " Joe , it takes a while to strangle a person . She would havep258stopped making noise as soon as your hands closed around her neck . Yet you continued to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze , did you not ? Once your hands were at her throat you could not control yourself , is n't that so ? You forgot all about Mrs. Starr as a person , a living human being of flesh and blood . She was now not she , but it . It opposed you , you must remove it from your path  --  " " Oh no ! " cried Detweiler . " What you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder : removal of the person who obstructs you from a desired end , as if he were a piece of furniture . When I said that material objects have an awareness , I do n't mean they are not to be distinguishedfrom living organisms . Certainly she stopped makingnoise . I had gained that , without killing her . Thus far it was like shutting off a radio , and I was about to take my hands away when I saw it . I was startled , to see it there , to recognize it ! " Mr. Melrose , you do n't know what this moment meant to me after my years of searching . Sculpture , a reproduction of the form of life . Taxidermy , closer insofar as it used that which remained after life had gone : something at least that had once contained life , unlike art . I had wondered what came next : embalming ? I thought about taking a course in an undertakers ' school . " All the same , I knew it was one absurdity after another , for life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt be constructed to meet every chemical and physical test , plasticskin , eye-lenses ground to specification , vacuum tubes and wires conducting electrical impulses the equivalent of human energy . As to the moral qualities , they would be easiestof all to establish : you merely arrange the switches according to a scheme furnished by such a person as my friendp259Tierney , who being a policeman is an authority on right and wrong . " But though you 'll have something fine , you wo n't have life , because the one thing that can not be simulated is time . And time is what I saw in Mrs. Starr 's eyes , behind the superficialpain and fear  --  genuine but superficial because pain and fear , no matter how intense , pass away in time . And if Time is stopped  --  well , you can not do it by holding back the hands of a watch with a needle  --  I have done that  --  any more than you can alter spatial measurements by cutting an inch off the end of a yardstick . " So I squeezed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , which were hazel and beautiful and sympathetic though the rest of her face showed anguish , for it is terrible to be killed , but at least she was not alone . I could hardly bear her pain at second hand . I know I could not have strangled myself while looking in a mirror : I had n't had the courage even to emasculate myself . " So in her eyes I watched Time move , flow , continue , and it did not slow down or speed up , because in real time there are no intervals as in the running of a watch , no tick-tock , and it is not like a river with here and there a ripple , a floating leaf or twig , a random current . It was , and then suddenly , it was not . Time had gone out of her and thus life . I had not caught it , arrested it as a policeman apprehends a lawbreaker , locks him up and can at will go to see him , feed him , consult him , beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did the police beat you ? " " It was nothing personal , " Detweiler said impatiently . " Never mind about that . I 've been treated a lot better thanI expected . . . . I released my hands and her body sank tothe floor . I was depressed . So I have failed , I thought . I havep260brought pain and terror and taken a life . Tierney had pointed out that I have been a flop at various endeavors , and in general the police tend to emphasize that two of my victims were women and suggest that I was trying to rape the Starr ladies or something , which is ironic when you considerthat Billie , at least , begged me to . She was naked , you see , having come from the shower . . . . But at the moment  --  I use the terminology because though I had watched Time stop in Mrs. Starr , it continued in me . " I heard a noise at the door , not loud but penetrating because metallic : a key probing the lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall to the girls ' room , now Billie 's alone since Betty had left , as it turned out : there was only one bed . At the end of the hall was the closed door of what used to be my room , light showing in a halfinchstrip along the threshold , the violent sound of a radio within : a boarder . There was always one , though I had not seen him . Back there , because of this radio I could not hear what happened out front , but I assumed someone was entering the apartment . Betty , could it be Betty ? The dresser lamp was lighted . Hastily I put Mrs. Starr under the bed and extinguished the lamp . I stood in the middle of the room . I had no plan . All was now dark , and I could hear nothing but the radio behind the boarder 's door , music , a Christmas carol , oddly enough Silent Night , ' loud as could be . This served to remind me of two things : one , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Starr always did that on Christmas Eve with the help of the girls : a small , artificial tree , Santa Claus beneath it , made of colored cotton , riding a sleigh along a strip of white cotton ; wreaths . The other thing that was in my quick glance at Billie 's dresser , I did not see the mountedp261squirrel I had given her for Christmas the year before . Had she destroyed it ? I wondered about that , and it was an importantconsideration owing to the fact that I had brought along with me this year another very much like it , for Betty ; in case Betty showed up ; I did not intend to leave it there for her . I had carried it under my arm while hauling Mrs. Starr 's body into the bedroom . I was still holding it : I certainlytook care of that squirrel . " There was someone in the room with me , other than Mrs. Starr . Someone alive . I could smell her perfume , and she was humming Silent Night . ' I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was removing her clothing and tossing it onto the bed . I stood right there , but it was dark , so neither of us could see the other ; and we were each ignorant of the significance of the situation , she not aware of my presence , I not knowing what she intended to do . " Another important feature : I thought it was Betty , I really did . I had a choice , either one or the other , so naturally I chose the one I preferred . The quality of a voice is difficult to judge if it is heard only humming , and I could tell nothing from the perfume . " As to why Betty would come into the apartment in such an assured way though she no longer lived there , did not occur to me . I had hoped she might leave her husband and return , and then I could get my old room back , and we could take up where we left off . She would make hot chocolateand little saltine sandwiches with peanut butter , and put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave until the last swallow , maybe only a drop or two of cocoa left and the slow-moving , melted lump of white sweetness  --  it was agonizing to wait for it to slide towards your tongue . Betty was a marvelous cook and did things ofp262genius with peanut butter alone : with pickles , with fried bananas , though her mother did n't like her to be in the kitchen , wanted her to improve her mind . Well , I used to talk philosophy and religion with Betty , but her mother did n't like that either . I suppose she was afraid of sex croppingup : misconceptions in the opinion people have of others are often sexual in their content . You take the districtattorney and the police : they were seriously inquiring whether  --  well , I have already said that . " Sex is important , like food , but at the same time very simple . It can be pursued by just two people , a man and a woman , alone on a desert island , or alone in all the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think about it , when it comes to human relations . Of course , when it comes to larger populations , then you get tastes , jealousies , and various diversions of energy , organizational matters , laws . I noticed in your list of whom you defend , Mr. Melrose , that no mention was made of sex criminals . " " You have an eye for particulars , Joe . I believe sex is the concern of medicine and not law . But perhaps I am just a coward . Nobody wins a sex case . " " Winning is important to you , I have n't forgotten that , " Detweiler said . " And I do n't condemn you , but maybe the greatest trial of this whole affair will be between you and me . Look , I do n't want to be executed , because I do n't like pain , and surely there must be some involved though electrocutionis supposed to be very fast indeed , but I am not bothered by the prospect of being dead . I do n't believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so good an eye ) it is different from being alive : mind and will still exist , and matter is merely converted into something else . " " Joe , " said Melrose , " I swear to you that though like allp263men you will one day inevitably die , you will not be executedas a result of the charges now against you . It is not my habit to make predictions , and I have never before given such an assurance to a client , but this I swear to you . " " But what about my obligation to society ? " asked Detweiler . " People ca n't be allowed to go around killing others if things are ordered rationally . " Melrose spoke quickly and harshly , as if to prove Detweiler'stheory that they were antagonists . " If you want to be rational , there is of course no proof that society exists , except as a meaningless term signifying the human beings who live in a certain place and time . Society is merely everybodyelse , and it is impossible to owe everybody anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although things are presumably ordered rationally . " Detweiler said : " I suppose you could owe them common decency . " " Whatever that is , " Melrose answered sardonically . " It would be common decency for a doctor to kill a patient sufferingfrom a painful , hopeless illness . Decent persons commonlydo that to injured animals . But according to society ' that is unjustifiable homicide , at least so says the Law . " " You may not be able to prove the existence of society , but you can see its power , anyway . We wear suits and ties , you and I , like most everybody else around us . We disapproveof murder , like most everybody else . Obviously there are various motives for taking human life and various means of committing the deed : these must be examined , in order to determine whether there was justification . I myself do not approve of mercy-killing . " Melrose asked sharply : " Why ? "  | " Because it denies the possibility of a miracle , " Detweiler said . " Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or bad for what you did , or no reason at all . I want you to plead not guilty . " " I guess my argument is full of holes , " Detweiler admitted . " I do n't know much about the Law , but I do n't welsh on a promise , and I promised Tierney I would plead guilty . " " Did Tierney beat you ? " Detweiler laughed . " Far from having struck me , he never even asked me to confess . In fact  --  and this will go to show you something about the man 's quality  --  he told me not to confess to that unless it was the truth ! " " Joe , " said Melrose , " you are an interesting man to talk to , but I do n't know whether I can afford the luxury of it , and I doubt that Tierney can either . You seem persistently to maneuver the other fellow into taking what should be your side of the argument , and you take his . Generally if I have to warn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired a reputation for keeping people out of the death house , but it is a dangerous game . At any time a jury might decide to break my perfect record , and when I lose in a capital case my client may lose his life . I therefore must warn him at the outset to expect the worst . " With you I am in the unique situation of insisting that you accept the best . There is the distinct possibility that Tierney was tricking you , that having assessed your characteras the sort that works against the grain , he induced you to condemn yourself . When I was a child in grade school , underweight and puny  --  unlikely as that seems today  --  I was often the target for the bullying of a certain largep265and muscular boy . It would have been hopeless to try to fight him , so I employed guile . On an occasion when I was in his presence and he did not strike me , I demanded an explanation for the failure . I like to be punched , ' I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocked me down . It hurt , and I do n't like pain any more than you do , but I had far rather suffer physical pain than moral . I insisted he do it again . The second time , his blows lacked half the force he Was capable of delivering . You are getting weak , ' I said . Again . ' " ' You are crazy , ' said he . " And you are a yellow son of a bitch , ' I replied . " ' Well , I 'm not crazy anyway . ' He balled his fist to strike me , but I had him now . " I cried : You are a weak , yellow son of a bitch . ' I said this from a bloody mouth . " At that point the lout burst into tears and blubbered : You leave me alone ! ' " My point is , " said Melrose , " that in human relations there are many different types of power , but the aim is always to get the other fellow to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary story , " said Detweiler . " Almost unbearably ruthless . Did you have no pity for your victim ? " Melrose answered softly : " None whatever . " Detweiler was terrified . If only Tierney were there to help him  --  or even the district attorney , who sought only his execution . Melrose was out to save his body and destroy his soul . Obviously , since he had committed the killings , and since there was no legal excuse for them but one , if he were to plead not guilty Melrose intended to represent him as insane.  |p266Then  Melrose made a final , crushing statement : " I did n't ask you to be my client , Joe . If you remember , you came to me . " Detweiler traced this out in his mind . True . He had a prior obligation to Melrose : it was a matter of time . " There is a practical difficulty , " he said . " I signed a confession . " " Under duress , " Melrose replied . " They beat it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no  --  " Melrose cut him off . " Joe , you have your own theories of reality , and they are interesting , challenging , serious , so serious that you took human lives in their pursuit , and are willing to lay down your own life as well . My own philosophydoes not have the magnitude of yours . I practice a profession of particulars , and I tell you that in a courtroom , reality is what the jury believes . " Melrose was a guileful man , as a lawyer should be in view of the imprecision of the law . To Detweiler , and he knew Tierney agreed with him , the punishment for killing was death . But he was now in the hands of this devilishly shrewd fellow , and no longer under the control of the straightforward , benevolent police . Melrose would have his way , had been practicing prevalence since childhood , according to his remarkable anecdote . Cunning was something new to Detweiler . It apparently consisted of pretending to do one thing while preparing to do another , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , " he said . " I will go along with you . I will plead not guilty , and may God have mercy on my soul . " He had decided to strangle Melrose , premeditated , mal/ice aforethought . No one could deny this would be absolute murder . But as luck would have it , at just that moment Tierney came to take him into court . " You will visit me soon at the jail ? " Detweiler asked Melrose . " Inevitably , " his counsel promised and then gave Detweilera hearty handshake with every evidence of honest feeling . " Thank you , Joe . Now let 's go in to face the bench . " He picked up a beautiful briefcase made of lizard skin . Once he got his way Melrose was not devious about showing his pleasure.  |p268TIERNEY  ASKED his wife to return the fried eggs to the pan for a once over lightly to coagulate their mucosity . She was relentless about not doing this till requested : it was her quirk . But very little irritated Tierney when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Kath returned the eggs to his plate the yellows were quite hard , and as was his practice with solid yolks , he chopped up the eggs , added catsup , and stirred up the lot into a pink puree , which he spread on his toast . He would have preferred standard sunny-side-ups , firm whites , running yellows into which the toast might be dipped . But he made do . He was not Detweiler , with finicky tastes . Katharine had got up earlier than he , to give Dennis and Mary breakfast and send them off to some church thing . John Michael , the baby , was still snoozing in his crib , in hisp269parents ' bedroom . They needed a larger apartment . Dennis ' quarters were in what was supposed to be the dining room . The Tierneys therefore were not equipped to entertain . On holidays they went to Katharine 's family , who now had retired to the suburbs . Except New Year 's Eve , when Kath 's brother James and wife held a regular get-together with relatives and friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cup of tea with Tierney while he chewed his . She had very dark hair but very white skin , was slender in outline but giving the impression of pudginess when touched . She had fat , motherly hands . Tierney reached across and patted the one not holding the teacup . He said : " We 'll see Jimmy tomorrow night , huh ? " Kath was fond of all four of her brothers , but James , the oldest , was her favorite : he guyed her a lot , slapped her behind , made her blush : " Still pee in bed , kid ? " Tierney did n't mind him , Jim being a goodnatured slob . Tierney 's sister-in-law , however , made him nervous . Everybody got a little high at these New Year 's functions , and men and women exchangedthe ritual kisses at midnight ; first , solemnly with their mates and then in a jokey manner with the others . Phyllis , Jim 's wife , once stuck her tongue into Tierney 's mouth , offending , frightening , and exciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened only once , but Tierney remained leery of her . Two nights afterward he had had a dream in which he watched Katharine French-kiss her brother . Kath said now : " But tonight is New Year 's Eve . " " Is it ? " Tierney looked at the top of the newspaper . " I lost a day . I could have sworn  --  " " Where does Time go ? " Katharine asked idly.  | " Why 'd you ask that ? " Tierney 's question had a violence to it , and Katharine showed surprise . She rose to fetch the coffee pot , not answeringuntil she had filled his cup , one hand on the glass cap of the percolator , which was habitually loose . " Another year will go down the drain , " she said . " I hate the thought . " Tierney winced . " We brought in this psycho , you know . " He took some coffee into his mouth and let it disappear . " I saw the pictures this morning . " Katharine pointed a spoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of you . " Tierney turned to the centerfold and saw his white face between black overcoat and gray hat . His eyes were caught at half-closure , and the caption of course did not identify him by name . The press generally respected the Department'swish to keep detectives anonymous , save the occasionalpublicity hound whose awesome reputation was supposed to discourage would-be wrongdoers and capture the imagination of the taxpayer : like Roughhouse Riordan , the Terror of the Underworld , who worked on special assignments . When thirty precinct officers trapped two punks in a cheap hotel and filled the premises with tear gas , Riordan might show up to make the arrest . Shuster , if you already knew him , could also be made out in the upper left of the same photo , but the focus was on Detweiler and the police commissioner . " Detweeler , " said Katharine . " What kind of man would kill on Christmas Eve ? He looks proud of himself , does n't he ? " She was being experimental , giving Tierney the opportunity to talk about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it was so exclusivelyp271masculine ; she would have been the same if married to an airline pilot or a Marine . Tierney had told her very little about the Starr murders , and the paper they took at home was not the one that printed Betty 's story , but rather that of old Starr , which furthermore Katharine had not read , as , in loyalty , she never read any special newspaper series that pertained to police affairs . She was really all wife and mother and gave Tierney no trouble whatever : he did n't mind the quirk about fried eggs and other minor matters . He said : " He is n't proud . He 's nuts . " Katharine answered quickly : " Is he actually , or is he just pretending ? " Tierney was astonished to see that for once she opposed him , and in his own work . He said : " Oh , you know all about it , do you , Kath ? " " I know I hate sex maniacs . " Her face colored in anger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride the subway and someone in the crowd pushes his lump into your backside . A man in a car showed his filthy thing to Dennis last week in the next block , in broad daylight last week . " " You did n't tell me . " " I never knew about it till yesterday . " " Had he seen him before ? What kind of car ? I do n't suppose he got the number . " Kath waved her hands . " I know , a cop 's son . . . . But do you realize why ? He might have been scared , but he was also impressed , and I find out about it only because I caught him , himself , showing his little whatzis to Mary . " " Oh for Christ 's sake , " Tierney exclaimed . " I 'll tan that little fart 's behind for him . I 'll teach him to be so fresh . His own sister . "  | " You maybe are missing the point , " Katharine said . " His sister or someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's anatomy that we all are supposed to be worshipful ? Why are sex fiends permitted to roam the streets and even enter private houses and murder women ? " Tierney did n't like to hear that kind of talk from a cop 's wife . For one thing , it lacked precision . " Well , Kath , " he said , " I have seldom seen you so worked up . You 'd think they were your relatives . As it happens , if you like to know , Detweiler is not a sex fiend . He 's even a bit of a Puritan . He did n't have relations with those women : he strangled them and that was that . He 's crazy . And it might surprise you but he 's quite religious . " " Do n't tell me he 's Catholic , " Katharine stated spitefully , " because never have I made a claim that  --  " " No , " Tierney interrupted , " he 's all by himself in faith , but as to his moral principles , I 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you might find this hard to accept , and I would n't mention it to anybody else ; Shuster for example  --  " " I never thought I would hear you defending a criminal . " " You have n't heard what I was going to say . " " But he killed women , did he not ? The dirty pervert . " " Kath , I have been on this case for a week now and I did n't hear you say a word till the present . " " You never caught him till now , " said Katharine . " I never saw him until the picture this morning . Look at him , little washed-out piece of nothing . I 've seen them on the subways , squeezing up against you , knee between your legs . " She pushed her saucer so that the cup wobbled within it , and said : " Sex criminals are always men . You can not deny it . "  | " Not true , " said Tierney . " There was a woman in the Tenth Precinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The exception that proves the rule , " Katharine said . " Women , " Tierney said passionately , " rape men in a different , deceitful way , and no amount of bodily exposure is ever considered indecent by them . There are women in this city who wear gray-flannel suits and smoke cigars ; they neck in public with their girl friends . Anybody from the Vice Squad can tell you enough about female offenders to raise your hair . You do n't know these things , Kath . You 've lived a protected life . " Katharine gave a dirty laugh , strangely reminiscent of Shuster 's . " No woman who lives in this hell-hole of a city is protected . " In view of Tierney 's calling , this was a real provocation . They hardly ever quarreled , and never before on a matter which referred to law enforcement . It was also a revelation to Tierney , after years of marriage , that Katharine , sister of four men , daughter of one , wife of one , mother of two , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had dismissed the incestuous feature of Denny 's displaying himself to his own sister . Brother Jim slapped her butt , joked intimately of her childhood bed-wetting : these things could be given a sinister interpretation were Tierney as rash as she . But he of course was not . Whatever their flaws as individuals , as a race men were peculiarly committed to justice . You could see this even in professional hoods , who defied the law but understood it . Tierney now had to consider whether he did not feel more at ease with a male criminal than with any woman . He had never had a sister , his parents were killed in a rail/way accident when he was a child , and he had been raised by an aunt and uncle , whom he nowadays rarely saw . He hardly remembered his mother . Without warning Katharine returned to her old role . She covered her mouth to yawn . Through her fingers she said : " Well , it 's none of my affair . It 's your job . " And as suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it 's a job for a man , " meaning in this sense a human being and not a sexual differentiation . The weird feature was that a moment later he did not know whether he had spoken aloud or expressed it to himself . No response came from Katharine , who collected their cups and deliveredthem to the sink . It was all the worse if he had thought , and not said , it . He went into the bedroom , fetched his pistol from under the pillow on his side of the bed , collected the handcuffs and leather-braided sap from the dresser , leaned over the crib and kissed the baby 's translucent forehead . John Michael as yet had very pale hair , even more fair than Detweiler 's . Tierney took his overcoat and hat from a shallow closet in the hall . From there he had a direct view to the kitchen and the back of Katherine 's cardigan and bowtied apron strings . It was superstition with him never to kiss her goodbyewhen he went to work : his was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is bad luck to wish good . He called : " So long , Kath . " She turned and said : " Oh , that informant phoned again last night , real late . I just remembered . " Tierney asked : " The woman ? " " Yeah , " Katharine said . She waved a dishcloth at him.  | " O.K. , I 'll see you when I see you . If you 're on late , you can come right to Jimmy 's . " " Sure , " said Tierney . " I 'll be talking to you . " He drove south for a few blocks through a gray morning with a low , oppressive ceiling that would soon release either a cold rain or a tepid snow , the temperature being definitely above 3z  --  F. His hands were too warm in his Christmas gloves , gift of Katharine , and he unsheathed them after he parked the car , tossing the pigskin gloves , still bright orange on the backs but already palm-blackened , onto the passenger'sseat . He went into a drugstore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hotel told him the Baysons had checked out the day before . The forwarding address was that of their home , in the near suburbs . Tierney already had that , and the home phone number , in his notebook , dating from his first interview with her on Christmas Eve . The line came alive after half a ring , and a weighty voice said : " This is the police . " " What ? " asked Tierney . " Who 's talking ? " He gave his name . " It 's about damn time , " the voice responded , as heavy but less ominously . " Who is this ? " " Arthur Bayson . What kind of protection do you people provide , anyway ? All night we 've been trying to reach you . We have been enduring a reign of terror . " Tierney had been apprehensive until now , fearing Betty had been trying to invade his home by telephone , on some private matter : this was the only sort of menace that scared him . However , the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Tierney 's job was routine . Therefore hep276was back at work again , investigating the irregularities of others , his own superseded . Arthur proceeded to explain , and as usual with civilians , he had exaggerated : the " reign of terror " consisted of some crank phone calls . The Baysons were of course listed in the phone book , and now famous . " A target , " said Arthur . " This is our home . We have no place to hide . Tierney said : " The telephone company will give you a new number . " " Absolutely no , " Arthur answered indignantly . " I refuse to run , to be run out of my own home . It 's up to you to take measures . " Tierney had a feeling he would say , " You got us into this , " but Arthur merely created the implication , then said : " Where were you all night ? I do n't keep guns around the house  --  I do n't hunt or anything . We 've got oil heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat up till dawn with a butcher knife . " Tierney said : " Generally speaking , the type of person who makes threatening calls does n't carry through . Usually he 's yellow , which is why he phones . If he was serious he would n't tip you off . " " I do n't want to hear rationalizations , " Arthur said in the kind of voice that might be accompanied by a stamping foot : his tone was deep but his rhythm almost girlish . " I do n't intend to argue the matter , mister . You 're a public servant , and you can damn well do your duty for a change . Or are you looking for a handout ? " " I 'll tell you one thing , Mr. Bayson . Nothing in the city ordinances calls for me to listen to that kind of talk . You should have called your local police last night . That 's not my jurisdiction , and I 'm not your private bodyguard . "  | " But this man , " Arthur shouted , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detweiler is the wrong one , that he will get us next . My wife is sick with fear , in bed , incapacitated . We feel trapped here , under observationfrom hidden eyes . There 's a vacant lot in back . I see a glint there , movement : he could be in that old shed . A high-powered rifle , telescopic sights : he could get us at a window . I 'm unarmed . I 'm an office worker . I 'm not trained for violence . " " Now calm down , " Tierney said mechanically . " It 's probablyyour imagination . " Arthur shouted : " Are you prepared to guarantee that ? " " Well , naturally I ca n't  --  " " You 're not God , are you , Tierney ? " This seemed to Tierney a very strange query , in view of his recent dialogue with Detweiler , though of course Arthur would not have had that in view : it was a common enough expression of democratic reminder , signifying " Who do you think you are ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleakly atheist though as often asked by churchgoers as any other . Tierney had himself asked it of Detweiler . Only now did he appreciate its meanness , its total denial of possibility , its frightened envy , its loser 's idiom . For the first time he considered whether Detweiler might not be a better man than his victims , not only the dead but the living ; this insanemurderer , this generous wretch . The thought made him more tolerant of Bayson , who after all was a civilian and under pressure . He was also thinking of Betty : in bed , prostrate with fear ? Tierney found it unlikely , but attractive . He said : " All right . I 'll come over . If you get any more calls , try to keep him on the phone . "  |p278Arthur  gave a nervous laugh , then seemed immediately to relax . " You 're probably right , " he said . " Imagination . But the calls were real enough . . . . There is somebody in the vacant lot : a kid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still want me to come over ? " " Of course , " said Bayson . " I think you owe it to Betty . " A cryptic remark if he ever heard one . Tierney called headquarters and left word for Shuster where he would be . Then he returned to his car and saw that his gloves had been stolen . Naturally he had not locked the doors . The vehicle was his own property and bore no special markings , but thieves could generally tell a detective 's car from the aura or aroma . No likely prospect was in view . The shop nearest the car was a barber 's , two-chair but , early as it was , only one man in attendance . He was of course Italian ; answered " Nub " to Tierney 's questions , saw nobody near the automobile . Bastard , thought Tierney , meaning the barber , who had probably watched the theft with pleasure , recognizing Tierney as an officer ; small shopkeepers often had a grudge against the Force during the holidays , when the beat cops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would not report this petty larceny to the precinct . He passed a park , the locus , in betterweather , of crimes of violence ; but now not only the season but the time of day maintained the peace . Felonies were fairly rare from dawn to about 1o:3o-11 A.M. Even criminals took a while to warm up , wipe the sand from their eyes . Parks held little interest for Tierney in whatever weather except insofar as who might be lurking therein ,  |p279though  he approved of trees and birds : he might take the family on a picnic next spring . Thirty-odd minutes later he found the Bayson residence on a street that was rural to his eyes : little houses , the vacant lot that Arthur had mentioned , the old shed or garage , and likewise the kid . This punk , eleven or twelve , had a rifle . Tierney left the car and advanced , opening his overcoat and suit jacket ; he did not expect to need his pistol , but there was a cardinal rule that anyone holding a firearm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orangutans , should be approached with caution . The weapon turned out to be a BB gun . " What are you doing out of school , son ? " Tierney asked sternly . The boy wore a knitted wool cap with a pompom at the summit . A scarf was wound many times around his throat . Near his mouth it was wettened . His eyes had difficulty in maintaining a consistent direction . He said thickly , and with no evidence of feeling : " I 'll kill you . I 'll burn down the shed . " He was an idiot . Tierney disarmed him easily , but finding where he lived was a problem . " Come on , " he said , " let 's go home and have some milk and cookies . " " You motherfucker , " said the boy , again without feeling , and his nose began to run . Tierney fetched out his own handkerchief and applied it . The boy blew his nose , then seized the handkerchief and kept it . The second personal article lost by Tierney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and led him out to the sidewalk . Presumably he lived down the street , the Bayson house being the last on the block . As they passed he saw Arthur peeping through the closed drapes.  | " I 'm going to eat some dogshit , " the boy said . " I 'll bet this is your house , " said Tierney , choosing one at random so as to provoke the child into a confession . By chance it was the right one . The boy said : " My cat , " pointing to a tiger-striped animal rubbing its ribs on a porch pillar . But the woman who answered the door directed Tierney three houses down . The boy suddenly spoke with clarity : " Stupid ! My cat , not my house . " " No , it is n't your cat either , " the woman said sweetly . " Cock and balls , " chirped the boy , and Tierney pulled him down the steps . At the correct door at last , Tierney was greeted by a youngish woman : " Hi ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Tierney , " but I do n't think you should let this boy play with an air rifle . " " Why not ? All the boys have them . " The woman cocked her head and stared suspiciously , though also with humor , at him . " Who are you ? " " A police officer . " " I was n't doing anything at all , Momma , " the boy said self-reliantly . " He just came and bothered me . " He was no longer glassy-eyed and wet-mouthed . Tierney got the picture : he had been hoaxed . He moved quickly to say  --  but not before the woman lost the last suggestion of amusement and clutched her son indignantly  --  " Why is n't he in school ? " She sent her boy into the house . " I sure find something funny about a policeman who has n't heard of Christmas vacation . Then where were Dennis and Mary ? Oh yeah , something at the church , rehearsal for some pageant or the like .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
