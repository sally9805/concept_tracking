txt A problem is vexing new African diplomats in New York that may never appear on the agenda of the United Nations . It is the often humiliating problem of finding a place to live . Since last fall , when seventeen new African countries joined the United Nations , housing difficulties  - -  caused mainly by racial prejudice  --  have been a thorn in the side of the United Nations , the State Department , anti - discrimination groups and real estate men in New York . Three successive American representatives at the United Nations  --  Henry Cabot Lodge , James J. Wadsworth and Adlai E. Stevenson  --  have used the power of their office to help Africans find homes . As of now , the situation is quiet . But it may flare up again when the General Assembly resumes work March 7 . The session will bring an influx of fifty or sixty African delegates . Letter Eases ' Way One example of how the American delegates have aided Africans here is contained in a letter received the other day by the fifty - two tenants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter was sent by the real estate broker managing the house . The diplomat 's name and . nation are deleted . " This will introduce Mr. who is Counselor of the Permanent Mission of to the United Nations . The Honorable Adlai E. Stevenson , the Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations , has personally interceded in behalf of the Counselor so that he may assure him possession of apartment 104 , formerly occupied by Mr. Maurice Chailloux-Dantel , a United Nations Secretariat member who died recently . " Mr. Stevenson in his letter to us underlined the urgent need to assist friends of our country who ' are new , to our shores and unfamiliar with our ways . " The letter was requested of " Mr. Stevenson by the owner , who refused to rent to an African diplomat until the United States mission had put pressure upon him . There has been no evidence so far of objections from the tenants . One of the occupants , a dentist , wrote this delegate shortly after his arrival : - " As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I take this opportunity to welCome you here , and trust that tour residence will be a pleas-ant one . " - Color prejudice blocks rentals but the situation is aggravated - by other problems involving African delegates to the United - Nations . They are : IlDiplomatic immunity , which can protect a delegate against a suit for non-payment of rent or departure without suitable notice . In at least two cases , landlords have forced Africans to waive immunity . qLanguage barriers . In most of the new African nations , French is the sole Western tongue spoken . tiDifferences in social customs , which have produced resentment between Africans and New Yorkers . CiThe refusal of Africans to a man to live in Harlem because they find segregation " degrading " and the area " unsafe . " : The Africans ' shock at the high prices and comparatively small sizes of New York apartments . Many Groups Help Working quietly but strenuously on the Africans ' side are the United States mission to the United Nations ; the United Nations housing office ; the city 's Commission on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , smaller , groups . " The United States mission steps in when the Africans come up against a blank wall in their search for housing , " a mission spokesman said the other day . The " blank wall " often faced is made up of a number of the 3,000 apartment agents and owners who are members of the Real Estate Board of New York . Last June , Ambassador Lodge notified the Real Estate Board in a secret meeting that there would be an influx of new African nations in the United Nations with the opening of the General Assembly on Sept. 20 . He warned the board that these countries , " uncommitted " in the " cold war , " would react sensitively to the treatment of their envoys in New York . A Third Have Trouble The Real Estate Board promised cooperation . None the less , about one-third of the eightyodd African diplomats involved last fall , most of them here with families , had moderate to serious trouble finding a place to live . " The Real Estate Board members as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States mission spokesman said . " It in- , volves both morals and the national interest . They showy reluctance to come to grips with . ' these issues . " A sympathetic real estate man put it this way : " It 's one of our terrible headaches . We 've asked the members to help , but I do n't think we 've got a hell of a lot of a good response . I wish to God we 'd put our heads together and do what 's best for the United States of America . " Last December , Mr. Wadsworth , successor to Mr. Lodge at the United Nations , again met with the Real Estate Board and pleaded for its support . Of the response , Frank E. , the board 's executive vice president , said : " Not one of them would say he would not cooperate ? not one of them . To the best of my knowledge we feel as patriots that we have to cooperate . " Mr. added that although the board had opposed the passage in 1957 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconstitutional , " now it is law , we must comply . " The law assures all residents of the city equal opportunity to live " in decent , sanitary and healthful living quarter regardless of race , color , religion , national origin or ancestry . " Board 's Role Explained " The board is a private service organization , " Mr. said . ' We can not dictate to our members what they should do . Our function is to open the door so the United Nations can present its case . " Last week , a letter went out from the board 's president , Gordon I. Kyle , to all of ' the organization 's members . Mr. Kyle noted that he was " greatly encouraged " by their response to the United States mission 's plea for aid to representatives of " newly emerging nations . " . " However , much as has been done already , the need still remains , " Mr. Kyle wrote . " These people require a variety of apartments in various locations and at various rentals . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed when apartments were available . Last October , after a number of African delegates had reported embarrassment , chagrin and frustration in their search for a place to live , the United Nations housing office determined to spare them such incidents  --  at least directly . A handsome , German-born woman of immense charm and tact , who speaks English and *French impeccably , was hired as scout and escort for those seeking housing . " My job needs heart and quiet persistence , " she said the other day . " It is very delicate . I always try to find out first by telephone or in person if the landlord will take Africans . " One of her greatest difficul. ties is that the African delegates generally want to live in -a high-rental area . " They do not want to live in Harlem . " she said . " They cite aPProve aw ilscrimination and find segregation degrading . Also , they say they do not feel safe in Harlem because the neighborhoods are run down . In addition , the African delegates have said they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference of viewpoint . " The escort explained : " They feel American Negroes have an inferiority complex and accept a second position in society . " They look upon themselves as visiting foreigners who should be treated extremely well . " Many delegates also refuse to live in the suburbs or outside Manhattan because they do not have cars and find the subway system confusing . The United Nations scout finds that real estate agents seldom say they wo n't take Africans . " There are other excuses . They have already let the apartment . Or they wo n't take children  --  almost all the delegates have families . Or the owner is in Florida . " A few will say outright that they will not rent to Africans . The reasons most often given are these : " Africans are n't clean . " " They 're not educated . " " They have strange habits . " " They will hold noisy parties . " One of the most ' telling counter-arguments is the importance of welcoming foreign diplomatshere , just as United States envoys are welcomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad . " If somebody 's hesitant , it may just tip the scales , " the escort said . Double-Standard Noted A spokesman for the Commission on Intergroup Relations , which has the power to enforce the Fair Housing Practices Law , commented on this : " How ironic . The same people who might take Africans would almost certainly not rent to our own Negroes . " According to the United Nations escort , all the Africans express shock at the racial discrimination " in the living example of democracy . " Many knew of discrimination in the South but were unprepared for color prejudice in the North . The Africans become aware of the discrimination more through evasiveness on the part of landlords and owners rather than spoken slights . Often , tenants report what is said to such agencies as the United States Mission or Committee on Intergroup Relations . In one case , a couple trying to sublet their apartment to an African delegate asserted that the building manager had told them : " I do n't want no African Negroes here . But I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we do n't want him because of his color . " One diplomat said bitterly the other day : " I am crushed by your civilization . I thought it was the most advanced ' in the world  --  a heaven , a- paradise . It was an illusion . " Do n't you Americans understand ? I want to get along with you . I want to make friends  --  for myself , and because it is in the interest of my country . I could only rent an apartment after I renounced my diplomatic immunity , and after the United States mission forced the landlord " The landlord now has my word . You Americans have my word that I have waived immunity . Will I have to sign a paper now ? " This African , a college professor in his own land , is married to a college graduate who was director of a school in Africa . " I 'm not just anybody , " the delegate said . " What kind of a tenant do they want ? My mother was the second woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Other shocks Africans encounter here are high rents combined with little space . The average rental paid by delegate : : who live in east midtown Manhattan is $220 a month for o one-bedroom unfurnished apart nent , with $100 more for eacl additional bedroom . According to the United Nations escort , " Government em . 3loyes in most African nation : five in large furnished housee. with gardens . Absolutely every . =ping is provided for them . " Delicate situations involving the difference in social customs have also arisen to vex the escort . " In Africa , " she said , " business and personal relationships are bound together . When an African gets into an apartment , he often looks forward to having dinner right away with the owner , getting on friendly terms with him . It 's absolutely natural back home . " I tell them : ' This is a big town . People are busy . " They work all day and are exhausted at night . The landlord probably wants to be alone quietly with family . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of the African delegates have found their fellow tenants hospitable . The experiences range from mere courteousness to cases of extreme warmth and generosity . " I think the worst is over , " a spokesman for the United States mission said . " This matter has required the most delicate private negotiations with owners , agents , tenants and the diplomats . A lot of the delegates coming here next month were in New York last fall . So they know what a strange , complex , fantastic place this is. "
