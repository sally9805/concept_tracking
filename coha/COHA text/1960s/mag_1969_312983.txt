When the cast of the new CBS summer series , Hee Haw-a hillbilly version of Laugh-In-arrived at the train station to start taping in Nashville last May , the performers were paraded ceremoniously through town atop mule-drawn hay wagons . " We felt like such goddam fools riding down the main streets , " recalls Co-Producer Frank Pep-piatt . " We thought there would be throngs to meet us , but we ended up waving to each other . " <P> If the response to Hee Haw seemed ho-hum in Nashville-the holy see of Grand Ole Opry and country show biz - then it seemed likely that the cast would be greeted anywhere else in America by bags of chicken feathers and cauldrons of tar . In a TV summer season stolen by Armstrong and Aldrin , the show 's only acknowledgment of the moon was the crescent-shaped opening in its prime prop-an outhouse . Had the public outgrown that sort of thing ? And would TV viewers be turned off by the program 's shameless plagiarism of their No. 1 favorite , Laugh-In ? <P> The answer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week , Hee Haw finished first with a Sunday night average of 27.3 million viewers . <P> Candy Farmer . Like so much of TV , Hee Haw is a show that nobody likes - except the viewers . Newspaper critics reacted as if it were good reason to pull the plug on rural electrification . CBS , with unaccustomed humor , is running promotion spots replaying the show 's most outrageous vignettes , with a kicker : " The critics are unanimous about Hee Haw-but watch anyway ! " <P> What the public is watching is gags lifted from tales as old as the Arkansas Traveller ( ca. 1860 ) but spliced together with production as new as Laugh-In . On Hee Haw , the graffiti adorn not bikini-clad boogaloo dancers but Burma-Shave signs , and the routines occur not at cocktail parties but in cornfields . That is their natural habitat . One of the company announces , " I 'm a farmer in a candy factory . " " Whaddaya do ? " asks a chorus of rural voices . " I milk chocolate . " In another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Junior , how come I saw you eating with a knife at supper ? " Junior : " My fork leaked . " After the worst lines-not that any of them are good-an offstage hand socks it to the culprit with a rubber chicken . Or an animated donkey pops up and chortles : " Would n't that sop your gravy ? " To the relief of CBS , Hee Haw , which has taken over the Smothers Brothers ' time slot , never gets more controversial than : " What 's the difference between a horse race and a political race ? " " In a horse race , they use the whole horse . " <P> <P> Many viewers presumably tune in not for the comedy but for the country-and-Western songs that fill up nearly one-third of Hee Haw 's air time . There are top-name guests , and the hosts themselves are no slouches . Roy Clark-the one who looks like a heftier Sander Van-ocur-was twice the national banjo champion . Guitarist-Composer Buck Owens-the cross between Andy Griffith and George Segal-is a leading country recording artist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
