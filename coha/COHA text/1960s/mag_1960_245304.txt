Since World War II , the U.S. has poured out $72.6 billion in grants and long-term credit . As their economies revived , the gold and foreign currency reserves of Western Europe and Japan combined rose from $8 billion to $24 billion-while the U.S.A. 's once huge surplus of gold reserves melted away . <P> Last week , in the bluntest language yet employed in public , the U.S. told its economic partners that the time has tome when they have got to take on their share of helping other nations , above all the newly independent countries , where continued political independence depends on economic stability and growth . The U.S. spoke out in Washington at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , the two agencies that together comprise a board of trustees for the capitalist system . <P> Eyes on Germany . Chief target of U.S. criticism-and everybody else's-was West Germany . For the past three years <P> West Germany has piled up a favorable balance of payments of $1.3 billion and now has more than $6 billion in gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary reserves , " said IMF Managing Director Per Jacobsson of Sweden . West Germany ought to be undertaking an imaginative capital export program . <P> U.S. Under Secretary of State Douglas Dillon joined in : " The eyes of the struggling people of the newly developing countries are upon us . They are looking in particular to the leading creditor countries , especially in continental Western Europe , * for an effort more in line with their capacities . For the safety and progress of the free world we must see to it that their hopes in this regard are met . " <P> A new organization called the International Development Association ( IDA ) got under way last week and immediately ran into the familiar experience of seeing other nations avert their gaze when the plate was passed . Conceived as a soft-currency adjunct to the World Bank , in which underdeveloped nations may borrow dollars and other hard currencies but can repay in a variety of nonconvertible currencies such as rupees or drachmas , IDA originally was to start with $1 billion in capital . Though the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell short , and IDA last week began with a capital of only $686 million . <P> Oops , Sorry . At week 's end the plain talk seemed to be getting home-a little bit . West German Vice Chancellor Ludwig Erhard , speaking in German , said defensively that his country had been forced to deal first with the rebuilding of its war-battered economy . " Not until this task las been successfully accomplished . " said he official translation of his speech , could Germany think of any " moral ' ' obligations to others . World War II ended 15 years ago and the German economic miracle has happened since . Four hours later the uproar in the back rooms had reached such a pitch that the German delegation hustled out a new translation ; the interpreter had made an error . Actually , said the Germans , Erhard had said : " It is only now , after this task has been successfully accomplished , that the German economy can undertake in larger measure to cooperate energetically in the extensive work of development aid . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least showed a proper sheepishness . <P>
