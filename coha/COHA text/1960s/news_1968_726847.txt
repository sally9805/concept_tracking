txt There was a small crisis yesterday when someone saw a large eagle in the Lincoln Park zoo . Normally there are always eagles in the zoo , but they usually just tit in their cages and stare at people . This eagle was sitting in a tree and staring at people . Dr. Lester E.

Dr. Fisher said that at first he was n't sure if he should trap it , but became more sure when it moved to a tree overlooking the zoo duck yard . He became absolutely , positive he should trap it when it began swooping down on people .
