" Foresees Wage Vote Senator Kennedy drew applause when he predicted that minimum-wage legislation would come to a vote and thereby expose the false friends of labor and that legislation to provide medical care for the elderly under Social Security would be passed this year . At a news conference he said he did not regard Adlai E. Stevenson as a Presidential candidate . He said he could not assess how much delegate strength Mr. Stevenson might have gained because of his recent speeches on the breakdown of the summit conference . At the news conference Senator Kennedy also discounted Mr. Stevenson 's suggestion that a special peace and disarmament agency be set up in the State Department . The Senator noted that he and Senator Hubert H. Humphrey had introduced legislation along that line , and that he would accept the concept if Mr. Stevenson meant that such an agency was to be limited to technical aspects of the problem , such as measuring nuclear tests . Senator Kennedy observed that the broader aspects of peace were the President 's responsibility .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
