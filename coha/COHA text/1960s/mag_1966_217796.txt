As a proud and somewhat willful lady , Indira Gandhi smarts under the allegation that she was picked as Prime Minister largely because the Congress Party 's political pros reckoned that she would be easy to control . Yet she seemed to confirm that charge two weeks ago when she backed down on three Cabinet changes after running into strong protests from party bosses . Last week , as if to assert her independence , Mrs. Gandhi went right ahead and made some Cabinet changes anyhow . <P> Defense for Home . True , no one was fired . But four ministers were moved to different jobs , and in the process she rid herself of a portfolio that she had inherited unwillingly two weeks ago . It was the important Home Ministry , from which she had removed Gulzarilal Nanda for his failure to block the violent Hindu demonstrations against cow slaughter that recently erupted near Parliament . Now she passed the powerful post to Y. B. Chavan , 53 , the former Defense Minister . In so doing , she also created a powerful potential rival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been impeccably loyal to Indira , but he , too , has the qualifications of a Prime Minister : service as an anti-British guerrilla in his teens , two jail terms during the independence struggle , experience as a former chief minister of the highly industrialized state of Maharashtra , which includes Bombay , and an excellent record as a Cabinet minister . He was originally summoned to New Delhi and given the Defense post in 1962 by Jawaharlal Nehru , who needed a replacement for Leftist Krishna Menon in the dark days after Red China 's attack . Chavan rammed through an effective rebuilding of the army . Now he was clearly out to rebuild the Home Ministry 's gentle image . His first major orders in his new job were to prohibit a student demonstration in New Delhi and to jail two socialist members of Parliament who encouraged students to defy his ban . <P> In Indira 's other ministerial switches , Swaran Singh , 59 , went from the Foreign Office to Chavan 's old post at Defense . His place in foreign affairs was taken by Mahomedali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served as ambassador to both the U.S. and Great Britain . Chagla 's vacant spot in Education went , in turn , to Fakhruddin Ahmed , 61 , whose old post as Minister for Irrigation and Power will be filled temporarily by one of his senior assistants . <P> <P> Syndicate Worries . What had Indira gained ? Very little , her friends feared . True , she had shown that she could defy the bosses , and her shuffle put stronger men in more important posts . The big fear was that her tactics had turned the most important party bosses against her . Powerful Railways Minister S. K. Patil was upset over the elevation of Chavan , a rival in Bombay politics . Patil is one of the three kingmakers who comprise the " Syndicate " that has often controlled Congress Party appointments . The other two-West Bengal Politico Atulya Ghosh and Transportation Minister Sanjiva Reddy-were also upset by Indira 's sudden show of independence . If they are still angry about it after next February 's national elections , they just might try to edge the proud lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
