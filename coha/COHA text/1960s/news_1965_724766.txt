txt The Wagner administration 's $3.5 billion budget , the biggest ' in city history , will be submitted Thursday with an unusual proposal that the Legislaturemake the final decision on whether to balance it by borrowing or by levying new taxes . Mayor Wagner will pose the alternatives for raising roughly $250 million in additional revenues to close the gap between contemplated spending and presently available revenue sources. , One alternative would be exempt borrowing for an 18-month period in anticipation of approval of a state constitutional amendment that would broaden the city 's real estate taxing au. : thority by upward of 20 per cent on a permanent basis . Another would be a 50 per cent surcharge for city purposes on the state income taxes that city residents now pay . A third alternative is still ' under consideration . It would be a city payroll tax of 1 per cent , half to be paid by the employe and half by the employer . The city must go to Albany for taxing or borrowing authority because , as a subdivision of the state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The Legislature this year is under Democratic control , but it is so split factionally that there is no assurance that any measure can be passed with Democratic votes alone . The oldest hands at budgetmaking in city service could not recall any previous occasion when a city administration sought to shift responsibility to Albany or . how a city budget should be put in balance . The unusual nature of the ! revenue proposals , each big enough in itself to achieve a ! technical balance at least , is fraught with political considlerations that in a municipal ! election year could become major campaign issues . Even before the Mayor 's intentions became known yesterday , Controller Abraham D. Beanie hastily convened a news conference to denounce the bor-1 rowing alternative as " an nn- ! ! sound proposal which threatens ! the credit and financial standling of the city . " He called it " a deviation from the accepted practice of the government of this city . ' and most city governments , to incur bonded indebtedness in order to meet current expenses . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he had said in an earlier executive session of the Board of Estimate , after giving notice to the Mayor , who is vacationing at , White Sulphur Springs , IV . Va . I " This borrowing proposal , " he declared , " is akin to a fancily man who lacks the will to ' earn a living , but prefers first to clean out his bank account to pay for his regular living expenses and then to continue to avoid working by borrowing ! to live in this same manner . ' Finally , he faces the day of : reckoning , This will he the city 's plight wider the proposal ! to borrow for current expenses. ; " The executive budget should ' be presented , properly balanced . ! If serial bond borrowings are used to do this , then , in my ! opinion , the budget will not bet properly balanced . " I believe that a realistic in , terim revenue program , which is sound and based upon fiscal integrity , should be developed . This revenue program should he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment . I stand ready to join in this effort . " The Controller thus affirmed that , while he did not object to broadened real-estate taxing authority for the city . he felt interim financing should be by new taxes instead of borrowing that would hurt the city 's credit and increase the city 's basic tax rate for 1968.69 to $5.82 or $5.83 , about a third above the present rate . Asked if his action constituted " an open political break " with the Mayor , who has asked The New York nun , DECRIES LOAN PLAN : City Controller Abraham D. heame said balancing expense budget by borrowing WOuid hurt city 's credit . him to he his running mate ' again , Mr. Beanie said : " Of ! course not .

For that reason , two successive postponements of the due date for the city budget were authorized by the Legislature . The Mayor is expected to use this situation as his explanation for leaving it to the Legislature to decide which of the alternative methods shall be used to balance a budget that will be roughly $150 million ' larger than the $3.35 billion ) program for the fiscal year ' ending June 30 . Spiraling welfare costs , the campaign against poverty and greater outlays for the police in their fight against crime are among the factors that have driven up city spending . The executive budget is nor- ! many submitted to both the " Board of Estimate and the ! City Council 10 weeks before ' the end of the fiscal year . Consideration of the budget this year , by force of circumstances , will be restricted to six weeks over all .

City 's Need Questioned Some civic groups have said they do not understand the need for the city 's proposed borrow ing-or-taxing alternatives in the light of nearly $200 million more in state aid that the city will receive in the year ahead . The borrowing has come ' Under early fire from the ! Mayor 's own Temporary Commission on City Finances , headed by Earl B. Schwulst , banker . The commission sent a ! communication to the Mayor , which he read to the Board of ! Estimate , denouncing the pro-1 posal . Mr , Beanie , in attacking the ! plan yesterday , said it was " sheer gambling to borrow money in the next two and half years in the hope that , upon passage of a constitution- ! al amendment and approval by the people of the entire state , ; the additional borrowing can ' stop .
