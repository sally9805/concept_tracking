CINEMA <P> Hemingway 's Adventures of a Young Man . There is nostalgically charming Americana in this reel-life pastiche fashioned from Hemingway 's autobiographical Nick Adams stories . Paul Newman 's portrayal of a punch-drunk old fighter is a memorable acting coup . <P> Strangers in the City is a brilliantly abrasive social shocker about a Puerto Rican family living in the rat-infested lower depths of Manhattan 's Spanish Harlem . Rick Carrier 's script , cast , and camera work have a harsh-grained honesty . <P> Bird Man of Alcatraz calmly examines the strange case of Robert F. Stroud , bird expert , murderer , and holder of the U.S. prison record ( 43 years ) for solitary confinement .

A saxophoney blues mocks and mourns the rise and fall of the criminal hero in this jagged , jazzy British crime thriller . <P> Boccaccio ' 70 is an erotic Italian film , though scarcely a linear descendant of Boccaccio , 1313-1375 .

Tack Lemmon , does not ask for anything more until Scotland Yard prods him into some horribly funny discoveries . <P> Lolita , as Sue Lyon impersonates her , could be 17 , which is ancient for mymphets . As a result , James Mason 's obsession with her seems like just one last pathetic middle-aged man 's fling . Peter Sellers saves the scenes he steals . <P> <P> TELEVISION Wed. , Aug. 1 <P> Howard K.
