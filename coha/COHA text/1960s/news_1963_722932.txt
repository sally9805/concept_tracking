txt President Kennedy revealed today the Administration 's main line of rebuttal to those who oppose his tax bill on the ground that it would enlarge the Federal budget deficit . He acknowledged that " t h e people are concerned " about the size of the national debt and the deficit , and he said that he was concerned , too . " But what I am most concerned about , " he said , " is the prospect of another recession . " " If we do n't have the t a x cut , " he went on , " it substantially increases the chance of a recession , which will increase unemployment , which will i ncrease the size of our deficit . So that is what it comes down to . " Earlier an attempt to help push Mr. Kennedy 's tax a n d medical care programs along by enlarging a Senate committee was rejected today . The Democratic Steering Committee rejected a plan to increase the membership of the key Finance Committee from 17 to 19 . The President discussed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference this afternoon . The big-deficit argument has emerged as perhaps the major issue in the debate over Mr. Kennedy 's proposals for tax reduction and reform . The budget deficit was bound to be a big one next year anyhow , but tax reduction would make it larger . The Administration will try to defend this on the ground that to do otherwise  --  to oppose the tax bill ? is to invite recession . This is an invitation that no politician would want to be credited with . The President was clearly seeking to pin it on those who are calling him irresponsible . Discussing the part of his bill that proposed reforms  --  reducing or repealing special allowances and so-called " loopholes " ? the President foresaw a hard fight . " Tax reform cuts across some of the most dearly held rights of many of our citizens , " he said . " It is hard to get them changed . " But if Congress refuses t o enact the reforms he has suggested , he said , then it probably will be necessary to settle for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is this : tax cuts for individuals and business totalling about $13,500,000,000 over a three-year period . These would be partially offset by reforms which would make a net revenue increase of about $3,500 , - 000.000 . Gordon To Testify The House Ways and Means Committee heard three days of testimony by Cabinet officials last week . Next week it will hear Kermit Gordon , the Budget Director , on the deficit issue , and then will begin five or six weeks of testimony by private interests . Mr. Kennedy said that " those ! who are opposed to the tax program should consider what the ' alternative is " " I think , " he went on , " it is restricted economic g r ow t h , higher unemployment ? if we fail to do something about unemployment and begin to move into a downturn , higher unemployment , there will be in , creased pressures for a 35-hourweek as a method of increasing employment , and I think it would be far more costly in the long run to the Government and to the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficit problem went this way : " In 1958 President Eisenhower thought he was going to have a half-billion dollar surplus . At the end of the 1958 recession he had a $12,500 , - 000,000 deficit , t h e largest peacetime deficit in the history of this country . We had another recession in 1960 , which also increased our deficit .. . " In my judgment , the best argument , and the one which was most effective as far as I was concerned , was that the reduction in taxes was an effort to release sufficient purchasing power , and was an effort t o stimulate investment , so that any downturn in business would be lessened in its impact a n d could possibly be postponed . . " The tax cut should be looked at not as a method of making ' life easier , because if t h a t ' were the only issue I think we would all he willing to pay our taxes to keep our economy go , ing .
