Hope that a future astronaut might some day find life on Mars faded deeper than ever into science fiction when Mariner 4 sent its remarkable snapshots across 135 million miles of space . The bleak , pocked surface of the red planet looked dead indeed . Because they saw no signs of erosion , space specialists from Caltech 's Jet Propulsion Laboratories , who had directed the Mariner voyage , concluded that Mars probably never had any significant amount of life-supporting water . Though they were not quite ready to deny the possibility of Martian life , the JPL men seemed all but certain that what they could not see was not there . <P> Not so , claim more optimistic scientists after a second look at the Mariner photos . The JPL men assumed that the surface of Mars is as old as the surface of the moon , say Physicists Edward Anders of the University of Chicago and James R. Arnold of the University of California , San Diego . If that were so , the two men argue in the latest issue of Science , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . Assuming a fairly constant supply of crater-forming asteroids , Mars , which is far closer to the asteroid belt , would have been hit up to 25 times more often than the moon . There would be as many as 220 craters per 1,000,000 sq . km. , not the meager 37 that have been observed . <P> In the same issue of Science , other researchers offer much the same conclusion . All of which suggests that other Martian craters , predating those that Mariner saw , formed and vanished eons ago . What happened to them ? All the researchers agree that they must have been eroded away - perhaps by swirling dust storms , perhaps by a flow of Martian water . " In any event , " conclude Anders and Arnold , " the crater density on Mars no longer precludes the possibility that liquid water and a denser atmosphere were present on Mars during the first 3.5 billion years of its history . " If there was water , there may have been life . And if Mars once supported some form of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mariner 4 project is not yet willing to rule out the possibility . Says JPL 's Dr. William H.Pickering : " The very fact of the infinite varieties of life on earth should preclude our jumping to the conclusion that there could be no life on Mars . The Mariner pictures make it a little more doubtful . But I still assume that there may be some life forms there , however rudimentary . "
