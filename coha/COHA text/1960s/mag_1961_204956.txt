The U.S. Tries Again <P> Ever since the atom became a weapon , the U.S. has been creating new programs for arms control and disarmament as fast as the Russians can reject them . Last week , in his address to the U.N . General Assembly . President Kennedy put forth still another U.S. offer to get started on planning for peace . This time the President picked up and took as his own the Soviet Union 's perennial demand for " general and complete disarmament " - but backed up that sweeping plea with some specific proposals . Kennedy 's steps toward disarmament included : <P> <P> Signing a nuclear test ban treaty . " This can be done now , " he challenged . " Test ban negotiations need not and should not of such materials to nonnuclear powers . <P> Prohibiting the transfer of nuclear weapons to nations that do not have them . <P> <P> Keeping nuclear weapons from outer space . <P> Destroying strategic missiles and aircraft that could deliver nuclear bombs . <P> <P> Actually , the President 's program contained little that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eisenhower-and it offered nothing that seemed likely to lure the Russians from previous stands against disarmament inspections . Despite Kennedy 's promise to resume discussions of any one step toward disarmament whenever agreement seemed in sight , the U.S. plan is basically a step-by-step approach requiring international inspection to ensure that each stage has been carried out . <P> A Start . Until the possibility of eventual disarmament is destroyed by Soviet intransigence , Kennedy is willing to keep working for some form of agreement . Last week that work got a start when the President signed into law the brand-new U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and named William Chapman Foster , 64 , as its director . Set up as a semi-autonomous agency , operating out of the State Department building , ACADA has long been a pet Kennedy project . Appalled that only about 75 people in the U.S. Government were at work on disarmament planning under Eisenhower , Kennedy set out to create a specific agency for the work , got congressional approval a fortnight ago . <P> Bill Foster was a logical choice to head the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Foster was long ago appraised by the New Frontier 's talent scouts as an able , experienced administrator who might some day fill a job for President Kennedy . Also like McCone , he is a Republican , which may help fend off partisan objections to actions taken by an agency new to the ways of Washington . Born in New Jersey , courteous , methodical Bill Foster studied at Massachusetts Institute of Technology , piloted " Flying Jennies " as a combat instructor during World War I , then spent 24 years with Long Island 's Pressed &; Welded Steel Products Co.
