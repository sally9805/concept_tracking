too glad to get away for a spell from the wife and kiddies , the suburban grind , bureaucratic infighting or diplomatic socializing . Many of them are not members of any branch of the military services or career employees of any civilian agency .

For them , too , Vietnam can be dangerous , but the risks are offset by splendid wages , differentials , free housing , cheap , liquor , good food at below supermarket prices , servants , and the irresistible bonus of a " butterfly " or two between visits to see the " little woman .

" The only Democratic bright spot at midpoint in the 1968 campaign is George Corley Wallace . As reports of his strength spread through the black communities , Demo  --  cratic professionals hope to stampede voters to the polls , telling Negroes that their votes are needed to keep the White House from falling into the hands of a blatant racist . In fact , assisted by several Agnew slips of the tongue , the Democrats hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But so far , nothing seems to click for them in the Negro communities , where the Democrats hope to garner 80 per cent of whatever vote is cast . And it is a not in  --  considerable vote , if it can be mobilized in the final few weeks . If Hubert Humphrey can successfully be portrayed to blacks as the least of three evils , the Democratic Na  --  tional Committee figures to turn out 8 million blacks on Election Day . That is 3 million shy of the number eligible to vote , but the size of the task can be measured by noting that in 1964 ? when blacks went to the polls with a ven  --  geance against Barry Goldwater-6 million voted . That kind of anger is simply not being generated by the present campaigns . It is particularly not being generated where it might really count  --  in the industrial North . The turn-out in the South , where 3 million blacks are registered in eleven states , is expected to be so heavy that some Democrats dream that a strong black vote in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Wallace canceling each other . Elsewhere in the South , however , no such hope exists . But there are several Northern states ? New York , Penn  --  sylvania , Illinois , Ohio and Michigan in partiCular  --  where a heavy black vote and a little bit of luck could hold the line for Humphrey . " It 's ironic , " a black Auto Workers official in Detroit was saying recently . " I remember when it was predicted that the Negro vote would one day be a swing vote and we could influence Presidential policies . Now , when that day is just about here , nobody seems particularly in THE NA:nONIOctober 21 , 1968 terested . My people tell me they are n't even making out well in getting people registered . What do you think is going to happen November 5 ? " The war in Vietnam , of course , has played the heaviest part in eroding Negro enthusiasm for either Hum  --  phrey or Nixon . But beyond that , Humphrey , the potential beneficiary from a heavy black vote , has damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that of George Wallace . Even Negroes who consider Car  --  michael a demagogue resent his being lumped in with a man whom most blacks consider a deadly enemy . Nor has Humphrey 's flirtation with the law-and-order and crime  --  in-the-streets issues endeared him to a Negro electorate becoming-ever more suspicious that those terms mask a form of racism . But still another reason , going beyond those negative concerns , is the shift in focus of the black community . In the years since the urban uprisings began , black com  --  munities have become increasingly introspective and in  --  ternally concerned . The emphasis on national leadership has given way to a preoccupation with what is happening at the local level , even the neighborhoodelevel . Neither in civil rights nor in politics have national figures been as important as local ones during the past several years . Partly with anti-poverty funds and partly because of the rise of nationalism and black identity , or  --  ganization at the neighborhood level in the black com  --  munities has drawn attention away from the great figures . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the local level ? Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy  --  are gone . Thus an odd comparison can be made between the be  --  havior of working-class blacks and working-class whites in this election year . The whites , frightened by violence and crime  --  but even more by aggressive Negro aspirations ? are turning in large numbers away from the liberal Center of Humphrey to the wild Right of Wallace . In doing so , they are banking on Wallace 's ability to contain the black threat by invoking greater police powers , which traditionally is not a Presidential responsibility but a local one . Thus it could be said , they propose to vote for a President as though they were selecting a tribal chief or a king . They are asking the President to serve as their de  --  fender against crime on the street corner , as though the job had become too big for the police ' chief ; as though too much were at stake for the matter to be resolved by the man in City Hall . The black component of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local level that there is nothing Negroes can gain from the Presidency , nothing to be had from Washington , no matter what man heads the government . That this should be so is especially striking when one notes that even some super-militants will concede that " Johnson did more for black people than any other Presi  --  dent . " Black leaders like Ron Karenga , founder-chairman of US , the Los Angeles cultural black nationalist organiza  --  tion , exert profound influence locally , within several miles of their home bases , but little influence on the rest of black America . Part of the reason is credibility . After listening for years to empty promises from politician 's and civil rights leaders , the black communities have turned to men they know and who are close enough at hand to be held to account . Thus the Democratic Party , the " party of the working people , " goes the last few halting steps to Election Day with its white blue-collar voters looking to a national figure to solve local problems , and with its black con @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that plague them nationally . Meanwhile , black and white radicals are talking  --  separately , of course  --  of forming new parties with new concerns and new goals for the na  --  tion . A private survey among politically oriented blacks turned . up a surprisingly large number of supporters for the idea in cities in middle America . Behind the move for a black new politics there lies the feeling that the major parties are so frozen into old commitments and alliances that they will never free themselves to respond to black people . Negro Democrats had hoped that the nomination of Channing Phillips and Julian Bond would show Negroes that they have a place in the party . They certainly assumed that the GOP nominations would prove that party closed to black aspirations . Channing Phillips has been on the , road , telling disaffected black and white Democrats alike that the ' party 's rebuilding must be done by them , and that they can succeed if they stick with it . But he reports that they often seem to doubt him ; they remember Mayor Daley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her voice , a black woman , and a regular Democrat in New York , said . " It 's a very strange election . It 's all as though it were an argument among white folks that hardly involves us . Yet ? do n't you feel this ? ? more than anything else , it 's about us . How odd this fall seems . " She and a couple of her friends had gathered in a favorite bar and were chatting in remote tones about what it all meant  --  losing Bobby , in whom they had believed so deeply ; the McCarthy candidacy , which shook the party to its foundations , but yet seemed , save for a handful of college kids , to have almost no contact with blacks ; the bizarre scene in Chicago . And then the sudden realization that George Wallace was not a quadrennial political joke ? but a serious contender for the Presidency of the United States . " I wish , " said one of the women , " that we could begin this year all over again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The others nodded assent . Chicago 's black voters could help topple Mayor Richard J. Daley from Ills national power perch on November 5 . By refusing to vote in the Presidential election , Negroes could help throw Illinois to the Republicans , and Daley must deliver Illinois to Humphrey if he wants to maintain his party ranking . This is probably one of the most dif  --  ficult assignments the veteran boss of Chicago has ever had to face . It is an intriguing thought , but , as the cats on the street would say , whitey 's got the brother in the trick bag again . The black voter in Chicago  --  and anywhere else , for that matter  --  has got to vote for Humphrey because there 's no place else to go . No matter how you add it up , the answer comes out the same . Use the old math of the rigidly controlled , survival-oriented Democratic machine and the conclusion is in  --  escapable : blacks will come out for Humphrey on Novem  --  ber 5 . Use the new math of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but add in the facts of life , and the answer remains unchanged : black voters will vote and they will vote Democratic . In Chicago , the black vote has long been locked into the Democratic machine . In the fantastic 1960 Presidential election , when John F. Kennedy took Illinois from Rich  --  ard Nixon by less than 10,000 votes , here 's how a fewof Chicago 's black wards voted : The 2nd Ward cast 21,100 Democratic ballots and 5,353 Republican ; the 3rd Ward went for Kennedy 19,990 to 5,003 , and the 24th Ward gave Kennedy 24,211 votes to Nixon 's 2,131 . In any one of these three black wards  --  and others de  --  livered returns almost as effective  --  the plurality was sufficient to swing the entire state of Illinois to the Demo  --  cratic nominee . Four years ' later , when the specter of Sen. Barry Gold  --  water stirred Chicago 's black voters to a little movement on their own , the pluralities in these same districts were extraordinary . The 2nd Ward turned out 23,238 for Lyndon B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Republican candidate could muster only 982 votes to Johnson 's 33,851 , and in the 24th Ward he got 304 to Johnson 's massive 21,662 . A lot has happened since 1964 . Rev. Martin Luther King , Jr. , was assassinated , his death putting an end to the nonviolent movement as a national force . Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was wiped off the political scene in the same un  --  believable manner , and ' another hero of black Americans was eliminated . Cities burst into flame , Chicago among them . The black pride movement caught hold and sud  --  denly black people started thinking for themselves  --  some of them , at least . In Chicago , one of these is Calvin Lockridge , who con  --  vened the Black Consortium , a confederation of about forty militant black organizations . When the conventions were over and the Presidential campaigns had begun to tick along , Lockridge startled blacks and whites alike by proposing a double-barreled anti-Establishment strategy He first called on blacks to vote for Wallace in an effort to throw the election into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither Humphrey nor Nixon will offer a meaningful program for the liberation of the black man , Lockridge said : " The ultimate goal of the vote-for-Wallace strategy is to break the two-party system . The system is what is strangling black people . So if you think black people voting for Wallace is extreme , you 'd better know that we 'll do anything to destroy the system . " But Lockridge came to recognize that this approach is too sophisticated for the black masses , and he began calling instead for a boycott of the polls , a protest tech  --  nique to be fashioned into a national strategy . A few ministers and independent politicians have joined the boy  --  cott movement in Chicago , seeking to persuade black voters that it is suicidal to keep on playing lackey to the Democrats . They argue that once the major parties know that the black vote is not automatic , meaningful bargaining can begin . Daley is being used ' as bait in the Chicago boycott at  --  tempt . Militants are saying that a nonvote is a vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political reputation , which took on national proportions during the bloodletting of the Democratic convention . But the boy  --  cott does not appear to be catching on in Chicago , nor apparently in other urban areas . A major reason is the threat of Wallace and Nixon-Agnew .
