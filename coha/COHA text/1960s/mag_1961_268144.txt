A democrat from the land where democracy was born and the word coined , Premier Constantine Karamanlis of Greece arrives in Washington this week for talks with President Kennedy . <P> A handsome , husky man at 54 , Karamanlis is something of an outsider among Greek politicians . He does not come from the tight little circle of Athens families who have traditionally run Greece . Instead , he is the son of a schoolteacher from Macedonia , which Athens sophisticates consider Endsville . But Karamanlis has restored order to Greece 's turbulent postwar politics , and stability to its economy . In his six years as Prime Minister , he has built a modern highway network that connects Athens and Salonica with hundreds of villages that once were far from the main drag , brought electricity to hundreds of thousands of Greeks who never had known anything but candles , got the shipyards going , and brought strength to the nation 's banks . Today Greece 's drachma for once commands confidence at home and abroad . Tourists who once chose Italy or France now flock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aegean islands , and scramble around the magnificent rubble of the Acropolis . <P> Karamanlis got his first Cabinet post ( the Labor ministry ) in 1946 , when postwar Greece was desperately weak and struggling with a Communist-run rebellion . He stayed in Cabinet posts-for a long time as the energetic Minister of Public Works-while first Britain , then the U.S. stepped in to prevent a complete Communist takeover . When Greece 's military boss and strongman Prime Minister , Field Marshal Alexander Papagos , died in 1955 , Karamanlis took over the government , has since been confirmed in power twice by thumping majorities of his own . <P> A man of few words , Karamanlis is the idol of Greece 's peasantry , draws fire from Greek left-wingers for his unflinching loyalty to NATO . When Greek tempers flared against the British during the long Cyprus crisis , Karamanlis resisted intemperate demands for a break with Britain , and his moderation contributed heavily to the final settlement . Karamanlis is an outspoken supporter of the Western side in such places as Laos , where , he insists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start something here , they start something there . The time has come to make a stand . "
