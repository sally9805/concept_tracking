Sunset . A blue Buddha dissolves into a large grey Teddy bear that weeps tears the size of a quarter . A little girl stabs a pig . A little boy urinates . Sixty white gloves run run run across a table . Bits of broken plaster abruptly assemble themselves into a bust of Dante . An egg cracks and marbles tumble out . A python oozes lazily around a large transparent bowl in which a child is huddled . Beside a giant telescope stands an old man , his ears blazing like light bulbs . On a narrow cot , a nude woman sits giggling and jiggling while an enormous , sinister horseshoe crab . . . <P> Most people would call it a nightmare . Lloyd Williams , the 26-year-old New Yorker who created this sequence of images , calls it a work of art . The startling thing is that a great many Americans now agree with him . After five years of lurid reports about an " underground cinema , " U.S. moviegoers have caught the show . For the first time , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to believe what a far-out few have been saying for years : the movies are entering an era of innovation that attempts to change the language of film and reeducate the human eye . <P> Image &; Movement . The Marat of the revolution is Moviemaker ( The Brig ) and Movie Critic ( Village Voice ) Jonas Mekas , 44 , a shy man with long greasy hair who looks like a slightly soiled Elijah .

The new cinema , though it will also tell stories , will be essentially a cinema of image and movement composed by film poets . " The new cinema is an art of light , " says Mekas grandly , " and it is bursting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first blush , it seemed a dirty-fingered dawn . Two months ago , Mekas and some film-making friends leased an art house in midtown Manhattan to present The Chelsea Girls ( Time , Dec. 30 ) , a 3-hour experimental peekture by Pop Painter Andy Warhol . Exclusively , explicitly and exhaustively , the film depicts homosexuality , Lesbianism , and drug-taking , and a majority of the critics ( most of them over 40 ) found it dirty , dull and on-and-onanistic . But moviegoers ( most of them under 30 and simply prurient ) stood in long lines to buy the scene . All over the U.S. , distributors suddenly sat up and begged for prints . In the next six months , The Chelsea Girls will be shown in at least 100 theaters-in addition to numerous college film societies . It figures to gross at least $1,000,000 . <P> With that one blow the barricades fell , and the avant-garde came storming through .

And Shirley Clarke 's Jason , a harrowing 120-minute interview with a black male prostitute , was offered a midtown opening as a hard-eyed cautionary tale and a surefire succes de scandale.
