They are also dumping abroad textiles badly needed in China itself at prices well below competitive exports from India , Japan and Hong Kong . But these measures can not conceal the fact that Mao 's communization has wiped out those exportable surpluses of soybeans , rice , pork and oils that used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
