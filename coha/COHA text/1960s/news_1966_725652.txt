Christian Leadership Conference , at 45,000 . The police estimated the crowd at 30,000 . Nearly 100,000 had been expected for the rally and a march on City Hall . Soldier Field can seat nearly 85,000 people . Dr. King , speaking under a black parasol that shielded him from the sun , declared : " A doctrine of black supremacy is as evil as a doctrine of white supremacy . " " The Negro , " he said , " needs the white man to free him from his fears . The white man needs the Negro to free him from his guilt . " Although Dr. King stuck to his position that " black supremacy " was as evil as white supremacy and assailed " black separatism " without mentioning " black power " as such , Mr. defended the term but gave it a favorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did not mean exclusion of whites from the Negro revolution , and did not mean advocacy of violence and riots . " Black power is not hatred , " Mr. declared . " It is a means to MITT the black American into the covenant of brotherhood . " Mr. explained that black power meant political power , economic power and a new self-image for Negroes . He also said black power did not advocate violence but rather the changing of the environment in which riots erupted . Mr. introduced as one definition of black power " the developing of a black consumer bloc nationwide able to strike at any concern . " He specifically mentioned automobile agency franchises , saying that if Negroes could not get them for a particular make of car , Negroes should " black out " that make . Dr. King also called for economic force . " We must make clear that we will withdraw our money ' en masse ' from any Dank that does not have a nondiscriminatory lending policy , " he said .

At City Hall Dr. King affixed ' a list of demands on the LaSalle Street door of the City Hall with adhesive tape as the marchers cheered loudly . A circle of them had joined hands to prevent anyone from getting within a dozen yards of Dr. King as he stood at the door .

" Heat Held Responsible The official high of 98 degrees was the highest temperature of the year , and was blamed by Miss Connie Seals of the Chicago Urban League , the rally 's press coordinator , for the disappointing size of the crowd at the rally . The city 's 31 bathing beaches attracted almost 594,000 persons . An informal count of the crowd indicated that perhaps 10 per cent were white . Two years ago another rally at which Dr. King appeared in the same stadium drew between 57,000 and 75,000 people , although , again , 100,000 had been predicted . During the three hours of entertainment before the speeches , a group of youths paraded behind a bedsheet banner with the words " Black Power " painted upon it . A placard with the words " We ' Shall Overcome " and " Freedom Now " and a drawing of a machinegun was also seen . The youths were identified as members of the Blackstone Rangers , a South Side Negro gang .

Obviously timed to appear be fore both the rally and Dr. King 's scheduled meeting with him at City Hall tomorrow , the Mayor issued a report on his own programs , the aim of which is the elimination of slum housing by the end of 1967 . Mr. Daley said that in the 18 months before July 1 of this year , 9,226 buildings containing 102,847 dwelling units had been brought into compliance with the codes . During this period , he ' said , $34-million was spent by Chicago property owners for building repairs , The Mayor , noting that the rodent control program had utilized $2-million in Federal antipoverty money , called it " the most massive and comprehensive rodent eradication program ever undertaken in this country .
