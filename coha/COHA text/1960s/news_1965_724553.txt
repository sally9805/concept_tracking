txt PITTSBURGH , Feb. 10 ? I. W. Abel clung to a narrow lead over David J. today as the vote count continued in the election battle for the presidency of the United Steelworkers of America . The margin was so small , however , that neither Mr. Abel nor Mr. , the incumbent president , would claim victory . Many of the big locals in basic steel , which have been tediously counting their votes , have been extremely slow in reporting their figures Unofficial returns compiled by United Press International from 2,779 of 3,203 locals in the union showed : Abel 249,839 238,267 Although Mr. Abel , now secretary-treasur9r of the union , made no public comment on the outlook , he was reported to be confident that he would come out on top . Some , of his aides were talking in terms Of a winning margin of 40,000 votes , but accurate projections in a // far-flung union election of this ! kind are difficult to make . Mr. made a brief , appearance before television ' cameras at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerful but pointedly refused to make a prediction , that he would win . He said that he was " definitely leading " according to the ' vote count compiled by his own ' people but that it was too early , ! to make a positive statement ! about the probable outcome . He , called attention , however , to the , importance of the big locals in , which the vote count was con- tinning . Some of his supporters have suggested that the returns . from these would raise his total ' sharply . Prior to question of fraud in the election . He was asked about this today but said that , so far he had not found any ' basis for taking any court ac- tion . The unofficial returns showed Mr. running well in , Pennsylvania , Maryland , the , South and on the West o- Coast ! Mr. Abel was strong in Canada , , the Buffalo area , tt . ' he Midwest and Southwest . In New England the two men ? ran a nipand-tuck race , with Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most important questions , however , was whether Mr. would emerge from Pennsylvania with a margin sufficient to counteract Mr. Abel 's expected majority in Chicago and in the Gary , Ind. , steel area . A sidelight to the over-all vote count was the result of , the balloting in Local 3657 , composed of staff and clerical employes at the international 's ' headquarters here . The vote was .131 to 108 in favor of Mr. Mc Donald , but the Abel supporters claimed a moral victory . Question on Negotiations The closeness of the election has raised questions about the prospect for an early resumption of negotiations between the union and the steel and can industries . Bargaining was recessed last month after the political campaign reached a fever pitch that appeared to foreclose any chance of making any real progress until after the election . Now the outcome of the vote is still unclear and everyone connected with the campaign from the top candidates on down is tired arid ready for a rest , rather than bargaining sessions . Moreover , neither candidate is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vote winds up as close as it now appears likely to . The official result , based on local union reports on special forms to the international headquarters , probably will not be known until several days after Feb. 19 , the date when returns must reach the secretary-treasurer 's office here . If there is any court challenge of the results or an appeal to the international tellers of the union , the declaration of the winner might be prolonged even further . Actually , the current officers serve until June 1 , but if Mr. were to lose the election , his role in negotiating new contracts would be considerably more difficult if he were a lame duck president . Can Contracts- Up First The first contracts to expire are those in the can industry ? on March 1st ? while the agreements with the basic steel companies run until May 2st . There has already been talk about the possibility , of extending , but this is not-likely to be done immediately . During his campaign Mr. warned that industry was watching the erection and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called for a- smashing victory so that there would , be no doubt who spoke for the union and had assured steelworkers that he would be a " hard-nosed negotiator .
