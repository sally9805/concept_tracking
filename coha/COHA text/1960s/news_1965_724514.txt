txt Five years ago John and Martha Kashan applied to the Home of Holy Infancy here to adopt a baby . They were age 35 at the time , had been happily married since their teens , were faithful churchgoers and Mr. Kashan held a steady job as a diesel ! tuck driver . After several interviews the adoption agency informed the Kashans that . while they met all other requirements , they were considered past the " desirable age " to adopt a child . In following months the couple applied at several other agencies and were met with similar refusals . " It was always the same ? younger couples were given the limited number of babies that were available , " says Mrs. Kashan . Last March , however , the Kashans decided to reapply to the Home of Holy Infancy . Three months later they were given a six-day-old boy . " You ca n't imagine how happy this has made us. " says Mrs. Kashan . " We 're thinking about going back and getting our son a baby brcalter. ? ' More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Throughout the nation adoption is becoming easier as the supply of available infants grows in relation to the number of . uples seeking children . The Children 's Home Society of California , the state 's biggest private adoption agency , currently is receiving about four inquiries for every child it has available : in the late 1950s. the ratio was 10 inquiries per child . This trend is causing agencies to sharply alter standards and techniques used in placing children . Agencies increasingly are approving applications from couples such as the Kashans who formerly were considered beyond the ideal age for adoptive parents . Also , less emphasis is being placed on such things as family income and physical matching of child and parents . Miss Ursula Gallagher . specialist on adoptions in the U.S. Department of Health . Education and Welfare . notes that a few years ago the primary requisite for adopting children was the assurance the child would be " well cared for . " But now , she says , " we emphasize that the child be well loved as a first consideration . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , the supply of parentless children is increasing fast due to the sharp rise in illegitimacy . Up to 90% of adoptions involve illegitimate children . An estimated 268.000 infants were born out of wedlock in 1961 , up 24 ' ; ) from 1960 and nearly double the 1930 total . The rate of illegitimacy among unmarried women has more than doubled since World War II . Almost one in 40 births among white mothers is illegitimate . and the rate is 10 times higher among non-whites . Fewer Potential Adoptive Parents At the same time , the percentage of married couples who are in the adoptive age group has declined because of the low birth rate during the depression . The supply of potential adoptive parents is cut further by important medical gains in treating infertility . " Five years ago we accepted as fact that there was one barren marriage in every 10 , " says Dr. Herman Kantor , a Dallas gynecologist and obstet.ician . " This has been reduced to 7% or 8% . " InThe Negro child has a far smaller chance or being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the estimated 67,300 adoptions in the U.S. last year were of white children , experts say , despite the fact that 60% of illegitimacies ? and thus a high proportion of adoptable infants ? are non-white . Total adoptions last year were up from 48,000 in 1954 . These exclude so-called " relative adoptions , " the adoption of a child by a step-parent or relative . The plight of the Negro child without parents is serious because fewer Negro couples have the income or other qualifications that agencies insist upon in placing -a child . Offsetting this somewhat is the fact that a higher proportion of unwed Negro mothers than white mothers decide to keep their illegitimate offspring . Nevertheless , many agencies have more Negro children available for adoption than they can place . " If we decided to handle 50 white children and 50 Negro children , we might be able to place all the white children in a year 's time , " says the director of a large Eastern agency .

Some agencies , however , are experimenting with special programs designed exclusively for Negroes .

Adoption agencies also are abandoning the Inquisitorial approach that often frightened prospective parents In the past a favorite method of many social workers was to drop in unannounced to inspz  --  ct the home life of a couple . Now a couple is interviewed by a caseworker six or . aa sit anics both at home and at the agency on a regular schedule . Then a supervisory group evaluates the caseworker 's study to determine whether it has been fairly conducted and decides whether the couple should be accepted or rejected . " We take a much more positive approach towards the applicant these days , " says Miss Helen Montgomery , executive director of New York 's Spence-Chapin Adoption Service . A frequent complaint of applicants in the past . she says . was that they never knew how they stood until all the investigations were complete and they were either accepted or rejected .

Evaluating the Parents Adequate housing , steady employment and good health are among the bass- criteria for an adoptive couple . But a caseworker also probes the emotional stability of the husband and wife and any other people in the immediate family . Adoption workers are especially on the lookout for marriages in which One spouse blames the other for their inability to produce natural offspring . This can be carried over by husband or wife into hostility toward an adopted child as a symbol of failure . " We often have couples come in here because they think an adopted child will be the answer to a shaky marriage , " says Miss Montgomery of Spence-Chapin . " We have to be careful we are n't placing a child with a couple who will break up anyway , after discovering their problem lies in another area . " At the same time , however , adoption agencies maintain they are putting less emphasis on finding " ideal " parents . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Miss Rita Dukette , adoption director of the Illinois Children 's Home and Aid Society in Chicago . " They do n't exist , and to seek them results only in postponing placements and suspecting families to unnecessary investigation and delay . " Other techniques also help streamline the adoption process . The Children 's Home Society of California uses a chartered plane to carry caseworkers and representatives into hard-toreach communities in Northern California , thus speeding the screening of applicants . The agency is also a firm believer in the value of public relations to attract couples interested in adoption . Since 196 , .2 it has persuaded California radio and television stations to donate $100,000 worth of air time to publicize the agency and as services . Publicity Help , : Such promotion can pay off . The Children 's Home Society of Washington in 1962 began send rig social workers into remote communities instead of expecting couples to drive long distances to Seattle for preliminary interviews ; it also began publicizing the fact that it had an ample number of babies available . As a result , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time since 1959 . To increase the number of potential parents , many agencies are encouraging couples with natural offspring to adopt children . Usually this is done in cases where couples are unable to have more children of their own for medical reasons . As with all adoptions , the adopted child acquires the same legal status , including inheritance rights , as a natural child . A Southwestern agency estimates that couples with natural children now account for 20r of the agency 's applications . " up from zero only two years ago . " More agencies , too , are urging couples who adopt one child to agree to adopt another later , thus creating a follow-up market for future adoptions . In dealing with minority groups and lowincome applicants , agencies are overturning traditionally cautious adoption policies . A young Negro Army officer and his wife who were visiting Seattle recently stopped by the Children 's Home Society there . The couple had been approved by an agency in their Midwestern hometown but that agency had no suitable babies available . Mrs. Ann Jamieson. director of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study ; instead , she promptly phoned the Midwestern agency for a summary of the couple 's background and then spent several hours personally interviewing them . " Satisfied that we had a good , responsible family . we introduced them to a child that evening , " she says . " They had another play period with the child the next morning and . by the afternoon of the second day , the three were en route to their home . " Subsidies for Adoptive Parents The Diocesan Bureau in Hartford , Conn .. a Catholic agency , occasionally subsidizes families in lower income groups when it feels they would be acceptable parents . Ed Power , agency director , tells of a Negro couple who had been approved to adopt a child . Before they received the infant , the husband 's union went on strike . Financially pressed , the couple informed the agency they would have to withdraw their application . But the Diocesan Bureau gave them $1,000 ' to pay bills and , soon after , the couple received a child .

" He adds : - We social workers have too long been penny-wise and pound-foolish ... Mr. Per is quick to point out . however that most adoption agencies eiciA financially on a band-to-mouth baus The nation 's more than 300 agencies generally are dependent on small amounts of state support or on community and indivisbail contributions . Agencies under state law generally are not allowed to make a profit on their services . But most ask the arinptinz couple to reimburse the agency for medical , legal and other tangible expenses . Usually a sliding scale based on income is used . New York 's Spence-Chapin , for example , charges $1.250 if the family 's annual income exceeds $16.000 .

" The Gray Market " Childless couples can arrange an adoption without using an agency , of course . and a great many do . This constitutes what agency workers scornfully call " the gray market . " In such cases . a lawyer visas:lily acts as an intermediary in the transfer of infants from unwed mothers to adoptive couples . " Doctors call me and say they are treating an unwed mother who needs help , and I find a couple who are interested in adopting the child . " says a Dallas attorney who arranges several such adoptions a year . The attorney says he collects $250 for such a service , of which he says only $100 is profit . Adoption agency officials claim that , in many cases , fees are higher . Agency workers also complain that attorneys who handle such adoptions often know very little about the prospective parents or the unwed mother . Thus , it is reasoned , the parents may not provide a good home or the infant may turn out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree . " Anybody with any sense knows adoption agencies can do a better job than a lawyer in placing a baby , " he says . " But if the unwed mother , or the adoptive parents , refuse for some reason to go to an agency , what can I do about it ? I 'd rather have the girl come to me than have her dispose of her child on a doorstep somewhere . " Sen. Thomas Dodd ( D .. Conn. ) a few days ago introduced a bill that would impose stiff fines and jail terms on any individuals profiting from placing a child for adoption . Licensed agencies would be exempt . A similar bill passed the Senate last year but failed to clear the House .
