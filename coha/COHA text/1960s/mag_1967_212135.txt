Academe 's massive fund drives no longer aim exclusively at new buildings and expanded facilities . Since the bigger need now is to meet annual operating costs , mainly in teachers ' salaries , there is a new emphasis at many universities on setting up endowed chairs . At the same time , sophisticated benefactors have found that giving their names to a professorship is more satisfying than simply seeing them carved on the donor 's plaque of a new building . <P> Columbia University 's current $200 million fund drive is centered around the creation of 100 new academic chairs , each to be backed by $750,000 in endowed funds . A primary goal of a new $52 million academic-improvement program at Notre Dame is to set up 40 endowed chairs at $500,000 each . Harvard , which has more than 300 endowed chairs , has been able to create 90 of them since 1959 . The public universities are eying the same kind of financial help . The University of Minnesota is trying to find donors for 20 chairs , while Wisconsin already has 64 chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price tag on academic chairs is high . The minimum at most prestige schools is $500,000 , which , at a 5% return a year , provides up to $25,000 for the professor 's salary . Yet the pursuit of such money is well worth a school 's time and energy , since endowments free operating funds . Stanford Provost Richard Lyman considers endowed chairs , next to outright unrestricted gifts , " the best possible long-term financial base for a university . " <P> The prestige of endowed chairs , normally named for the donor or someone he wishes to honor , often helps a university land top scholars . The glitter of endowment helped hold Sociologist David Riesman at Harvard as the Henry Ford II Professor of Social Sciences . <P> Among Yale 's 25 Sterling Professors* are Historian C. Vann Woodward and French Literary Critic Henri Peyre . The State University of New York landed Nobel-prizewinning Physicist Chen Ning Yang for a state-subsidized $100 , - 000 Albert Einstein Chair in Science . Endowments frequently support visiting professorships , such as one at the City College of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year is held by Indian Sitarist Ravi Shankar . <P> <P> To land chair money , fund raisers often cater to the specific interests of the potential donors . Conservationist Laurence Rockefeller , for example , endowed a professorship of outdoor recreation at the University of Michigan . <P> <P> Corporations can often be tapped for chairs allied to their interests , such as one in pediatric nutrition supported by Mead Johnson &; Co. at the State University of Iowa . <P> Successful Technique . Usually , the best way to land a donor is by appealing to his desire for intellectual distinction . As Columbia College Publications Editor George Keller puts it : " You can feel almost like a Medici prince-personally responsible for a distinguished professor 's livelihood and scholarship . " One successful technique is that used by California 's tiny Claremont Men 's College , which has set up ten endowed professorships since 1958 . " The best way to do it is to take the great teacher who will occupy the chair to meet the prospective donor , " contends Claremont Presidential Assistant John Payne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
