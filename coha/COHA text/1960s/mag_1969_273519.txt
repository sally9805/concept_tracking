In scenes reminiscent of labor wars in the 1930s , the nation 's campuses erupted in more violence last week . At Roosevelt University in Chicago , rebels invaded the president 's office and ripped out telephones in a demonstration seeking amnesty for fellow rebels . Deputy sheriffs prevented seizure of the ad ministration building at Eastern Michigan University by 200 students , cut chains off the doors and arrested twelve demonstrators . At Berkeley , 100 police men clashed with thousands of demonstrators supporting a month-long strike for Third World Liberation Front demands . Pelted with rocks , bottles and fire bombs , the cops fought back with Chemical Mace , clubbed four strikers and arrested 24 . While the University of California 's regents met at the ex plosive Berkeley campus , Governor Ron ald Reagan alerted National Guard units to stand by in nearby Alameda . <P> How long can the violence continue ? <P> According to the Educational Testing Service , a mere 2% of all students are wreckers who aim to " radicalize " the campuses even if some universities are destroyed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varying degrees of militancy as a series of concentric circles ; most students are mainly onlookers ( see chart ) . Unfortunately , the torrent of spring-term disorders has clearly put dozens of campuses in dou ble jeopardy . Repressive state legislators are on the war path ; so are vigilante-minded conservative students . Unless moderates intervene , campus freedom and evolutionary reform may well be sacrificed to left and right extremists . <P> Patience and Restraint . Fortunately , amid all the highly publicized violence , signs of moderation are appearing . Last week the dangerous eleven-day strike at the University of Wisconsin , which pitted bayonet-wielding National Guard troops against students , was called off while faculty members considered various reforms . Toward the end , as few as 300 students continued the strike , compared with 7,000 strikers during the Guard 's initial invasion . At Howard University in Washington , black law students quietly heeded a federal judge 's order to end their lock-in , called to obtain more voice in administrative decisions . The student lawyers planned to go on boycotting classes , but not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies have already taken a second look at good-faith faculty efforts to make archaic universities more democratic , relevant and effective . On some campuses , skilled administrators have warded off outside interference by firmly dealing with radicals while simultaneously " co-opting " their saner demands . <P> On other campuses , students in the middle have simply wearied of disruptions that constantly interrupt their costly education .
