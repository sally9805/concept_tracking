txt The expenditure of $1.1-billion over 20 years to expand ' the city 's outdoor recreation facilities is urged in a report that demands first priority for community parks , play areas and athletic fields . The report calls for at least one 10-acre community park for every 80,000 persons , with a minimum of one park to a community . In addition , it asks one athletic field of at least eight acres for every 80,000 persons , plus swimming pools , tiny parks and playgrounds . The study was made by the National Recreation and Park Association , a nonprofit education and service association headed by Laurance S. Rockefeller , at the request of the City Planning Commission . The Federal Government paid $100,000 of the cost , and the city $75,000 . Park Association Critical The report was needed by the state , according to experts in the City Planning Commission , to qualify the city for Federal recreation funds . The emphasis in the 196-page report on neighborhood needs and sports has stirred up considerable resentment in the Park Association of New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the document " disappointing , " " unimaginative , " and biased toward sports with " lip service paid to nature conservation and passive recreation . " It says " a new report should be initiated at once . " Although the report does not mention racial tensions , it notes that neighborhood and community recreation projects can help meet " the growing outcry for improved social programs and services in the poverty-stricken sections of the city . " Recommendations Offered In calling for " generous " Federal and state assistance to meet the 20-year objectives , the report urges the following : 9That the Jamaica Bay area , covering some 60 square miles of parks ; islands , and beaches be considered as a potential national recreation area for " usage never before reached by a park . " That Federal and state governments assist the city in taking over available areas in Coney Island from the Boardwalk to Surf Avenue and from Eighth to 24th Street for recreation to stem encroachment by apartment-house builders . That the state assist in developing the Greenbelt area of Staten Island along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas P. F. Moving . Mr. Lindsay and Mr. Moving oppose a parkway suggested by Robert Moses . The report noted that residents of New York City , particularly in poor areas , were at a disadvantage in seeking recreation facilities . It said that while the major parks and beaches were used by great numbers of visitors , New Yorkers were often denied access to suburban facilities . The city 's major recreation lag , the report said , is in its lack of neighborhood recreation facilities . There are enough large parks for citywide use , it contended , though much of the area needs development . The report said the city had 54 citywide ? parks covering 27,000 acres , and 54 miles of waterfront . Of community and neighborhood needs , the report noted that there were now 1,299 neighborhood playgrounds totaling 1,737 acres , but it said the city needed 665 acres more . There are now 70 community parks with 3,688 acres , and 388 acres more are needed . At present the city ' has 37 athletic fields , covering 177 acres , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming pools , the city needs 41 more . It should add six community centers to its present 91 . City Found Lagging The report declared : " New York City 's existing recreation system while keeping pace in the provisipn of citywide areas , lagged far behind even minimal standards for community and neighborhood facilities . In fact , insufficient open space for communities and neighborhoods constituted the major inadequacy of the system . " This insufficiency means that the city is least wellequipped in regard to current public demands for recreation programs oriented to the social needs of the community and neighborhood . " To illustrate this shortage , the report observed that in a contiguous area of Brooklyn and Queens from Bedford-Stuyvesant to Corona-East Elmhurst , containing 690,000 persons , " there is not a single community park or moderate sized public open space to serve this city within a city . " The report contended that this area alone , about the size of Boston , should have six to nine community park facilities covering 90 acres . With its suggestion that , if necessary , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletic fields in " larger parks , " the report- has stirred strong resentment among conservationists . For example , the Park Association critique says : " The art of landscaping , once a primary concern in park planning , is here ignored . Thus Central Park is looked upon as a diversified sports campus and not as a great masterpiece of landscape architecture . " Commission Plans Study In defense of its demand for athletic fields , the report noted that almost two-thirds of the 90 high schools here lacked athletic fields , although two-thirds of them had athletic programs in baseball , football , soccer or track and field . " This insufficiency of athletic facilities , " it said , " has probably completely curtailed certain kinds of athletic programs in New York City that have significance elsewhere . " The report urged greater coordination between the Department of Parks and the Board of Education in recreation matters . The Planning Commission Is known to have serious reservations about the report , and intends to use only what it considers feasible . The commission is drawing up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public early next year . Donald H. Elliott , chairman of the Planning Commission , said in a preface to the present report : " It should be clear that this report is a beginning rather than an end product . The task before us now is to consider it within the broader context of development priorities , fiscal and administrative resources , and the challenging social and economic forces that must be considered in framing citywide planning policies . " The Park Association appraisal goes even further . While it commends the Planning . Commission for having , called for the report , it adds : " The report unfortunately does not adequately outline the goals and recommendations that should be embodied in a major 20th-century recreation plan . New York 's need for such a plan is acute . A new plan should be initiated at once . " The report was turned over to Governor Rockefeller more than two months ago , One reason for the delay in its publication was that some changes were made . Some statistics were corrected and a short insert was prepared praising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Parks .
