The Way West is a standard horse epic in which the Oregon trail is a metaphor for life and the people in the wagon train are symbolic of mankind . Adapted from a novel by A. B. Guthrie Jr. , the film has somehow lost the earthy realism of the book , and has become merely a landlocked ship of fools . Among the passengers are a flint-eyed scout ( Robert Mitchum ) , a pioneering couple ( Richard Widmark and Lola Albright ) , a frightened newlywed who alternately freezes and teases her husband , a Negro slave-not to mention a crowd of teenagers , old folks and other essentials of the wayward western . <P> Along the way , lives conveniently intertwine like braids . The frustrated newlywed groom sleeps with a nubile teenager , and gets her pregnant . A wild shot in the dark kills a prowling Indian boy . His father , a Sioux chieftain , demands a life for a life , and the leader of the pioneers ( Kirk Douglas ) hangs the offender-who happens to be the adulterer-with his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teenager . <P> Like Moses , Douglas leads the way but never settles in the promised land . Thirty miles from it , as he descends by rope from a cliff , the widowed bride coldly cuts the cord and he plummets to the rocks below . A wooden slab marks his resting place , and the troupe troops on to Oregon . <P> From the beginning , The Way West is off on the wrong trek . As was common in the taming of the frontier , there is a great waste of natural resources-in this case , Mitchum , Douglas , Widmark and Albright . All are solid professional performers who deserve to travel first-class next time they journey West .
