On Jan. 9 , 1957 , two months after he had called off his country 's invasion of Suez , Sir Anthony Eden resigned as Prime Minister , leaving a nation divided at home , humiliated abroad , gravely weakened in its alliances . Sick and saddened . Eden declined the earldom that goes , by long tradition , to departing Prime Ministers . Unlike Sir Winston Churchill , who refused a dukedom rather than forgo his lifelong passion for the House of Commons . Eden felt that he was too weakened by a major abdominal ailment even to make a nominal showing in the House of Lords . <P> Eden 's health has mended since , along with the other scars of Suez . Retiring to his country house in pastoral Wilthsare he buried himself in his memors* and , say intimates , began to feel that thereby he deepened his insight on many issues ( but not , his memoirs suggest , on Suez ) . Hankering for a platform again , Eden , now 64 , last week finally accepted his earldom from Queen Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to public life . In coming months Britain must reach decisions on two troublous issues : the possibility of war over Berlin and the complex problem of membership in Europe 's Common Market ( TIME , July 7 ) . Even his sharpest critics concede that Eden has unsurpassed firsthand knowledge of foreign policy over three decades . Eden 's plans for German reunification still influence Foreign Office policymakers , and Macmillan occasionally drops in on Eden at his country home to seek his views . The two do not always agree-last month , in his first major speech since his retirement , Eden made plain that he had serious reservations about the government 's approach to the Common Market . <P> Diehard romantics declare that Eden 's earldom has a far more intriguing explanation . Recalling that handsome , 30-year-old Nicholas Eden , Sir Anthony 's son-about-town , has frequently been seen with Princess Alexandra of late , they insist that Father took the title to bolster young Eden 's prospect of a royal marriage . <P> <P> * Commissioned by the London Times for an estimated $280,000.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
