A few years ago , a Scandinavian composer proclaimed : " I believe in Bach , Mozart , Carl Nielsen , and absolute music . " Carl Nielsen ? At the mention of the Danish composer 's name , most non-Scandinavians could only look blank or grope for their music dictionaries . Nielsen 's reputation in his homeland had been supreme since his death in 1931 at 66 , but unlike his Finnish contemporary Jean Sibelius , he was a nobody in the European and especially the U.S. music world . <P> Until recently , that is . In 1962 Leonard Bernstein began programming his works in New York Philharmonic concerts and spurred wider interest through a series of brilliant recordings . By 1965 , the centennial of Nielsen 's birth , his music was nudging into the general repertory . The number of Nielsen recordings on the U.S. market jumped from three in 1960 to 35 at the end of 1967 ; last year alone , 16 were issued . Today he is a " new " discovery who , like Mahler and Ives , appeals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century symphony with the experimental spirit of 20th century music . <P> Struggling Keys . Nielsen 's relative isolation during his working years in Denmark helps to explain his early obscurity . But at the same time , that remoteness enhanced his originality . Such composers as Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss , who were working in the late romantic tradition , projected their explosive forms out of subjective , often agonized emotion . Nielsen 's free-flowing counterpoint and virile rhythms sprang partly from Danish folk roots , partly from a robust , wholesome objectivity . " What business have other people with my innermost feelings ? " he asked . <P> He disdained the spicy suavity of French and Russian music , especially the orchestrations ( " A harp in an orchestra is like a hair in the soup " ) . Yet his sonorous , spontaneous-sounding scores so deftly exploit the personality of individual instruments that they speak like characters in a drama-in fact , they often battle each other . His Clarinet Concerto , for example , is built around an argument between the clarinet and snare drum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nielsen 's tensile construction , though , is the struggle between various keys within the same piece , a device that he carried to its logical limit while composers from Wagner to Schoenberg were melting down traditional notions of specific keys . The first movement of his Symphony No. 6 achieves a tragic effect by trying vainly to return to the idyllic G major from which it starts ; it succeeds only in reaching the neighboring keys above and below it . <P> Flying Sparks . Like his music , Nielsen 's temperament blended traditional peasant qualities with a progressive sophistication and disenchantment . Born on the bucolic island of Fyn , he made his first " instrument " from various lengths of cordwood , which he banged with a hammer ; later he learned violin and trumpet from his father , a house-painter-laborer who played at village dances . He was barely 14 when he left home with a military band to start his career . For most of his life he had to play in orchestras , conduct or teach to support himself : when the Royal Orchestra premiered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen sawing away dutifully at his regular stand in the second violin section .
