As A.F.L.-C.I.O. bigwigs gathered in Bal Harbour , Fla. , for their annual executive-council meeting last week , they were in a grim mood . They were mostly unhappy over Congress ' second refusal to repeal Section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act , which allows states to enact right-to-work laws . Pete McGavin , executive secretary of the federation 's maritime-trades department , spoke for many of his colleagues when he observed : " If President Johnson had put as much emphasis on 14(b) as he did on his wife 's beautification program , the measure would have gone through . " <P> That was not their only complaint . Union leaders resent Johnson 's attempts to impose wage-price guidelines , which they regard as discriminatory . Labor was irked last year when the President allowed Congress to shelve the minimum-wage bill , and is now disappointed by the Administration 's proposal to set a minimum wage of $1.60 an hour by 1968 rather than the $1.75 that it has requested . <P> Bounced a Bit . When Labor Secretary Willard Wirtz went to Bal Harbour to argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the guidelines , the labor barons were hostile . " We bounced him around a bit , " one official said of the private meeting with Wirtz . A.F.L.-C.I.O . President George Meany , 71 , issued a pronunciamento that sounded like a declaration of independence from the Democrats . " I 'm quite sure the labor movement is prepared to make its own way politically , " harrumphed the old Bronx plumber . " I do n't buy the idea that we have no place to go . Some of the Democrats seem to have the idea that we 've got to go along with them . " <P> Lower-echelon labor officials emphasized that the federation 's Committee on Political Education would step up its activities on a " nonpartisan " basis , aimed only at electing liberals in this fall 's congressional elections . In fact , this is what COPE has always done ; most of its beneficiaries have been and will continue to be Democrats . Moreover , Meany was careful to steer the animosity away from Lyndon Johnson . <P> Ladies Present . An official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican minority leader , for the defeat on the 14(b) issue . As for the dispute over guidelines , Meany said that the " arithmetic smacks of trickery " on the part of the President 's Council of Economic Advisers . <P> Meany said that he could not express his true feelings about the council-which is also advising the President on the minimum-wage bill-because " there are ladies present . " <P> Later in the week , having accomplished his dual aim of venting labor 's frustrations and warning Congress that it would be wise to pacify them in an election year , Meany insisted that he had neither caused nor sought a split with the Johnson Administration . It was , said he , " just a family quarrel . "
