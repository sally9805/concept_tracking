New York , with some 50,000 working artists , can lay claim to being the art center of the world . But almost to a man , artists are plagued by a common problem : lack of light and space big enough to serve as studios . The fact that the art community continues to swell and that works these days grow ever larger only exacerbates the problem . To get a space big enough to work in , Painter Mark Rothko , for instance , once took over the gymnasium of a no longer used Bowery high school . Helen Frankenthaler , who ordinarily works out of an East Side brownstone , had to hire a theater to stretch out her 30-ft. - high banner painting for Expo 67 . Ellsworth Kelly confesses that he never saw one of his large canvases all in one piece until it was put together in an exhibition . Some artists , such as Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg , who work on the same billboard scale as James Rosenquist , have bought their own buildings . <P> By and large , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old industrial lofts . But living there often meant breaking the city 's fire and non-occupancy laws or entailed the double cost of maintaining separate living and studio quarters . And with urban renewal , even lofts are becoming a rarity . Last week a spate of new projects , all aimed at alleviating their housing problem , convinced artists that their pleas for help might at last be beginning to register . <P> <P> The National Council on the Arts and the J. M. Kaplan Fund announced a joint project to convert the eight-building Bell Telephone Laboratories on Manhattan 's Lower West Side into a $10 million artists ' center providing housing for 500 painters , writers , musicians , dancers and film makers . At the same time , Lyons Houses , which owns ' a chain of dollar-a-night hotels on New York 's Bowery ( where artists have traditionally hobnobbed with derelicts ) began renovating one of them , the Alabama , into studio housing , eventually may follow suit with others . And in Brooklyn Heights , the city has decided to include a low-cost studio cooperative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects , the conversion of the Bell Laboratories is by far the most ambitious undertaking . The building itself-where Herbert Hoover watched the first television demonstration , Jascha Heifetz recorded on one of the first " primitive " hi-fi systems , and Sam Warner made the first " talkie " - is peculiarly suitable , with its 10-ft. to 16-ft. ceilings , a cafeteria and an auditorium , all features that Architect Richard Meier hopes to preserve in the ren ovation . Tenants , to be screened by a citizens ' committee , will be able to rent units at approximately $110 a month .
