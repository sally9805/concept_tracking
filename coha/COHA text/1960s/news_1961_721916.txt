txt WASHINGTON , July ** is part of the mythology of official Washington that the American people have a tendency during international crises either to go crazy or go fishing . Accordingly , half the officials here since the Berlin crisis have been concentrating on waking the people up and the other half have been concentrating on calming them down . On this basis it 's obviously going to be a hard summer . This week 's crop of rumors indicates what 's ahead . First we have been told out of London , on no stated authority , that the Communists in Moscow are so mad at the Communists in Peiping that they have been writing poison pen letters saying Mao Tse-tung is a warmonger , a deviationist , or worse . Next , dramatic plans for the military defense of Berlin are " leaked " out of the Pentagon , and then it is disclosed that the F. B. I. is " investigating " the " leak " . in order to impress the Communists with the authenticity of the plans . Then there are rumors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is heading a committee to study the defense of Berlin . When he was in the State Department he was vilified by the Republicans for giving away Korea ( or was it China ? ) to the Communists , but now , instead of being soft on the Communists , it turns out that he is the hardest man in town , ready to recommend smashing an armed convoy through to Berlin at the drop of an East German rubber stamp . As a matter of fact , Mr. Acheson is doing nothing of the sort . He is hard indeed , but he is not going around demanding war to prevent the Russians from making a separate peace with East Germany . He regards East Germany as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Soviet Union . He is certainly opposed to granting to the East Germans rights on the Berlin roads the Russians do not have , for this would obviously be giving more to the hyena than to the lion , but at the same time he is not advocating war for technicalities . This is just one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another . All of a sudden the air is full of tales that President Kennedy is about to set in motion the vast apparatus for calling up the troops and galvanizing the Europeans to do the same . This , it is said , would really " wake up America " and " impress the Russians , " and of course it would . The only trouble is that it is n't true . No doubt some moves to strengthen the military posture of the alliance will be taken , and high time , but the solemn act of " mobilization , " which is regarded in Europe as the last act before the battle , is not in the cards at this time . After all , the Strategic Air Command is in a position right now to do more damage than all the armies on all sides in all the wars of the last 100 years . The Soviets are full of rumors too . What they are really worried about , they insist , is the nuclear rearmament of West Germany , and no doubt they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Germans with nuclear arms . He may increase the size of nuclear weapons under his own command in Europe , but he has no power to give nuclear weapons to the West Germans . This is in , the hands of the Congress , where he matter is not even being discussed , but the rumors are bandied about nevertheless . The effect of all this is not that the people are stirred up , but that they are mixed up , and when people are mixed up they do either go crazy or go fishing . Either they believe all the breathless rumors and think we are on the edge of the precipice , or they disbelieve everything and underestimate the danger . Fortunately , the Administration is beginning to do something about this . In the Soviet Union , diplomacy and what they call " journalism " are combined , but in the West they are separate , one private and the other public , one slow and the other fast . This has added to the confusion , for while the policy makers here nave been meditating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidance about the underlying facts , and sometimes even without help in knocking down dangerous rumors . In the last few days , however , the State Department has been trying to correct this by providing more official information about what 's going on , and if they add to their crisis " operation center " some means of checking facts around the clock , the next six months may see a purer stream of reliable information . Even then , the summer is bound to be full of alarums . For it is not only Khrushchev who is trying to shout his way through to Berlin , but Kennedy who is trying to shoutl his appropriations through the Congress . This means that Khrushchev will be saying that if he does n't get what he wants the mountains will bounce and the rivers run red , and Kennedy will be saying that if every appropriation bill does n't go through the Congress - with every cent intact , Naughty Nik will inherit the world , which would probably serve him right . Accordingly , let the reader beware . Things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say they are . As a matter of fact , they seldom are in Washiligton.
