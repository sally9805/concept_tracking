txt 120 : Science , the Never-Ending Quest center O. Lines OA and OB are equal to the radius of the circle , and form an angle a with each other . If we draw a line from B perpendicular to OA , we have a right triangle OBC which contains the angle a . You will recall from Chapter 3 that the sine of angle a is equal to the side opposite the angle divided by the hypotenuse . Now let us suppose that the radius of the circle is equal to one unit of length : OB =1 . The sine of a then becomes That is , the sine of a can be represented by the length of the line BC in a circle of unit radius . As shown in part ( b ) , the corresponding length can be used as a convenient relative measure of sin a as the angle varies from 0 ? to 90 ? . To apply this method to angles larger than 90 ? , it is necessary to divide the circle into four portions or " quadrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will now examine the angles in the second , third and fourth quadrants in turn . In Figure 48(a) the angle b has a magnitude somewhere between Sound , Light and Waves . 121 90 ? ( right angle ) and 180 ? ( a straight line ) . As shown in the diagram , it is the angle between DO and OA . By analogy with what was done in the first quadrant , we can define the sine of angle b as the perpendicular line DE . ( Sin b , therefore , equals sin c . ) We can now represent the sine of any angle between 0 ? and 180 ? as the length of an appropriate line in our unit circle . The sine of an angle as great as 180 ? has little meaning , of course , in connection with ordinary triangles . But we are redefining the concept of the sine of an angle in order to do a completely different job . Figure 48(b) shows how angles between 180 ? and 270 ? are handled . The sine of angle d is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the line GH . Similarly , the sine of angle f in Figure 48c is equal to the line JK . This makes it possible to cover all angles up to 360 ? . By considering additional revolutions of the radius around the unit circle , the sine of any angle ? no matter how great ? can be represented by the length of a line . The sine of 360 ? + a ? , for example , is the same as the sine of a ? . The sines of such angles will proceed through precisely the same variations during each subsequent rota-tion around the circle . This regular repetition of line lengths is anal-ogous to all kinds of simple oscillatory motion found in nature . Figure 49 shows how a sine wave can be constructed graphically with the help of a unit circle . The horizontal line on the graph is marked off evenly in increments of 30 ? . The distance of the sine wave above or below the horizontal line at a particular angle is equal to the length of the line representing the sine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Science , the Never-Ending Quest To illustrate how the sine wave is drawn , consider the angle BOA which is drawn equal to 30 ? . The sine of that angle is line BC . The length BC is then used to draw the point on the graph above the 30 ? mark . Angle DOA is equal to 60 ? , and the sine of 60 ? is equal to length DE . This length is used to draw the point on the graph above the 60 ? mark . Angle FOA , 90 ? , has a sine equal to line FO , and that length appears above the 90 ? mark on the graph . In that way , a series of points is drawn corresponding to the sines of various angles . When many angles are plotted on the graph , a smooth curve can be drawn through all of the points . We call that curve a sine wave . Sine waves are important because many periodic oscillations are sinusoidal in nature . Consider , for example , a weight hanging at the end of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight as the place it occupies when at rest . If we start the weight oscillating up and down , its displacement from the zero position in the course of time can be accurately described by a sine wave like that of Figure 49 . Similarly , the pressure variations of a sound wave follow the same sine-wave pattern . In Figure 50 , the upper part of the diagram gives us a satisfying pictorial representation of a sound , but the sinusoidal curve beneath tells us precisely how the pressure varies . In addition to sound waves and oscillating weights , sine waves can be used to describe radio waves , light waves , clock pendulums , oscillating fly-wheels , X-rays , gamma rays , alternating electric currents , and even moving electrons and other atomic particles . Wave motion is a funda mental concept that permeates all of science . It is quite impossible to understand science without a knowledge of waves . The Building Blocks of Sound Scientists were shocked in the early part of the nineteenth century when the French mathematician Joseph Fourier ( 1758 ? 1830 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibrating musical instrument ? can be represented as a sum of different sinusoidal motions . These sinusoidal motions have different frequencies , and different amounts of swing ( amplitude ) , but each individual motion ( called a " com ponent " ) , can be represented as a sinusoidal curve . In the later nine teenth century , the German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz ap plied Fourier 's ideas to sound . Sounds are produced by moving bodies , so the resulting sound waves ought to follow the same pattern of changes as the motions that caused them . To illustrate , imagine a machine gun firing periodically at a rate of five-hundred shots per second . Helmholtz tells us that the series of pressure impulses that reaches our ear is nothing more than a great number of simultaneous sine waves that add up to produce the complex pressure wave we hear . Each of these sine waves travels through the same air at the same time and at the same speed without affecting the others in any way . No matter how complicated the motion of a sound source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of many independ ent sinusoidal sound waves . Each behaves as if it were produced alone . Each travels through the air as though the others did not exist . And all add in the ear to produce the complex sound we hear . This concept of the nature of complex sounds is more than a simple method of calculation or a convenient way of thinking about them . 124 : Science , the Never-Ending Quest Fourier 's ideas have been illustrated experimentally over and over again in many fields of science . It is now possible to analyze complex sounds electronically , and they are always found to have just the sinewave components predicted by the Helmholtz theory . Complex sounds are merely the sum of a great many simple sounds . This theory enables us to understand how we distinguish between the same note played on different musical instruments . A clarinet , for examples , generates the fundamental note and considerable amounts of the odd-numbered harmonics . The even-numbered harmonics are much weaker , especially in the lower range of the instrument . A clarinet playing G @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as goodly amounts of 3 x 196 = 588 cps , 5 x 196 = 980 cps , and so on . When playing that note , the clarinet produces very little sound at frequencies of 2 x 196 cps or 4 x 196 , etc . The flute , on the other hand , has a sound-wave recipe concentrated almost wholly in the fundamental and first two or three harmonics . Brass instruments such as the trombone and trumpet emit considerable amounts of sine waves at all frequencies up to the fifteen harmonic or higher . So it is the particular mixture of sine waves that gives each particular sound its distinctive auditory character . Beats When we listen to two simultaneous sounds that have nearly ? but not exactly ? the same frequency , we are aware of a sensation called " beats . " The two sine waves blend into a single note having the frequency of the higher pitched sine wave . The amplitude or loudness of the combined note varies up and down in loudness at a slow rate . This rate is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves . Suppose we are listening to two sounds having frequencies of 100 and 99 cps . We hear a single note whose sound level varies periodically at a rate of 100 ? 99 or 1 cycle per second . Joseph Sauveur explained beats as the periodic coincidence of the vibrations producing the two notes . To illustrate , consider the two upper sine waves in Figure 51 . Each is produced independently by a different vibrating tuning fork , and the two sine waves are slightly Sound , Light and Waves : 125 different in frequency . Because they are different in frequency , the higher frequency note in ( b ) " catches up " with the lower frequency note in ( a ) periodically so that their maximum intensities coincide . Whenever that happens , the ear hears a relatively loud sound . At other times , a minimum of one note coincides with a minimum of the other and we hear a softer sound . As shown in ( c ) , the two sounds add in the ear to produce the effect of a single note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference in frequency of the original sine waves . Those fluctuations in loudness are called " beats . " Most of the notes of the piano are produced by two or three strings , and each set of strings is tuned quite accurately to have the same frequency . This is done by adjusting the " beat frequency " ? the differ-ence in frequency of any two strings ? to zero . Nevertheless , you can probably hear slow beats ? about one or two per second ? by striking a single key on the piano . The jangly sound that we associate with a barroom piano comes from beats that are too rapid for the ear to follow , or count . Beats are most easily heard when the two sounds involved are relatively free of harmonics . It is easier , for example , to hear the beats produced by two flutes or softly blown pop bottles than those produced by a piano or two trumpets . But in any event , it is important to understand that beats are produced by the ear in the process of 126 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vibrating systems that produce the sounds are vibrating at the beat frequency . Combination-Tones The beats studied by Sauveur are heard only when the notes are of nearly equal frequency . If the interval between the notes is increased gradually , the beat frequency soon becomes too great for the beats to be distinguished . If we go on increasing the interval , the difference in frequency between the two notes eventually reaches the range of human hearing and becomes audible . Like beats , this combination-tone , as it is called , is a " sound " produced by the hearing mechanism of the listener . How to Make Visible Sounds After witnessing experiments conducted by Ernst Chladni ( 1756-1827 ) , Napoleon remarked that " Chladni made sounds visible . " About 1785 , Chladni began his investigations of vibrating flat plates , made of metal or glass , which were clamped at the center or edge . He made the plates vibrate by rubbing their edges with a violin bow . Then he hit upon the idea of sprinkling sand on the horizontally clamped plates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand shifted from the vibrating to the nonvibrating parts of the plates . The shifted sand formed patterns , or Chladni sound figures , which displayed the nodal lines of the plate . These lines are analogous to the nodal points of vibrating strings ? points at which a string 's motion is zero . By studying the sand patterns , Chladni was able to discover the way in which the various portions of a plate vibrate in order to produce a specific sound . A few of his sound figures are shown in the accompanying diagram . The first figure shows the sand pattern when the square plate is clamped at the center and bowed at a corner . As with the vibrating strings , the portions of the plate on opposite sides of a nodal line move in opposite directions at any particular instant . In the second figure , the bowing is done at the center of one of the sides instead of at a corner . The third figure Sound , Light and Waves . 127 shows the sand patterns when the plate is clamped at A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circle moves in the opposite direction to the outer portion . Chladni produced and studied a great many of these figures and helped to clarify the different modes in which a plate or diaphragm can vibrate . The Interference of Sound Waves , whether of sound , light or water , are little affected by objects that are small compared to their wavelength . A water wave , for example , flows right by a small piling almost as though it were n't there . Ocean waves have a wavelength of many feet , which is con siderably larger than the diameter of a pile sticking out of the water . Sound wavelengths are quite another matter . Some of them are large compared to everyday objects while others are small . The lower notes on the piano keyboard have wavelengths of thirty or forty feet while the high notes have wavelengths of only a few inches . While a low note passes around an ordinary object easily , a high note may cast a " shadow " behind the same object . Sound waves exhibit a mixed be havior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person 's head may cast a shadow for high frequency notes . When he sings a low note , the sound level behind him is almost as great as in front of him , but if he whistles a high note the sound is considerably stronger in front . Similarly , when we walk around a corner from a hi-fi speaker , we continue to hear the low frequency notes but the high frequency notes are all but lost . Sound shadows of that kind make it difficult to study sounds in an ordinary room . 128 . Science , the Never-Ending Quest Another difficulty has to do with reflections . Sounds are reflected back and forth from walls and objects in a room , and the sound we hear is a complex mixture of sounds arriving from many paths . For these reasonssound is often studied in a room made of special soundFig. 53 . The interference of sound . Two sound waves arrive at point P in phase or in step and reinforce each other to produce a sound that is louder than either one alone . In part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase and cancel each other . Parts ( a ) and ( b ) are " snapshots " of the pressure variations in the space of interest . In part ( c ) the pressure variations are plotted as they would be received at point Q in the course of time . Because the two sound waves always produce equal but opposite pressure variations , their net effect is zero . absorbing walls , a room free of echoes called an " anechoic " chamber . If we imagine ourselves in such a room we can perform a hypothetical experiment that illustrates the interference of sound . Suppose our room contains two loudspeakers a few feet apart as shown in part ( a ) of Figure 53 . Each loudspeaker produces sine waves of exactly the same frequency and both sine waves are pre cisely in step with each other . That is , the points of maximum pres sure at a given instant occur at the same distance from the speaker Sound , Light and Waves : 129 for each sine wave . Such sine waves are said to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human ear , placed at point P would notice that the two sine waves arrive in phase ( with one another ) . They started out in phase , and traveled the same distance to reach point P , so they arrive in phase . Because the ear receives two sine waves whose pressure variations are precisely in phase in the course of time , the effect is as though a single sound had arrived having twice the sound level . Turning either sound on or off merely changes the audible level of the sound . Now let 's consider what happens at a different point Q as in part ( b ) of the diagram . Point Q is a little nearer to one speaker than to the other . That difference in distance is equal to one-half wavelength , so a wave crest from one speaker will arrive at point Q just as a trough arrives from the other . In fact , the two sine waves will add up to zero at any instant . This cancellation is illustrated in part ( c ) which shows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time . Sine waves which oscillate out of step with each other are said to be " out of phase . " The two sine waves interfere with each other at point Q such that no sound at all can be heard . At points intermediate between P and Q , the two sine waves are neither in phase agreement nor completely out of phase and the sound cancellation is only partial . As we move our ear from P toward Q , we hear a gradual reduction in sound until it disappears completely at Q. If we continue beyond Q , the sound gets louder again as the two sine waves approach a second " in-phase " condition . At an appropriate point , the distances from our ear to each loudspeaker differ by precisely one wavelength . Under these conditions , the crests of the two sine waves arrive in phase once again and add to produce the loudest sound ? just as they did at point P. If we move our ear still further in the same direction , we hear a successive variation in sound level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of phase . This phenomenon is called the interference of sound . Interference is common to all kinds of wave motion and explaining it is a major success of wave theories in general . The sounds we hear in an ordinary room are never completely cancelled by interference , but the direct and reflected sounds con130 : Science , the Never-Ending Quest stitute an extremely complicated interference pattern . This pattern is different for each frequency because of the variation in wavelength . Some frequencies may reach the ear at a particular point and add to produce a loud sound , while others may cancel partially at the same point and produce a soft sound . We are accustomed to these effects in our everyday lives and they do not usually impair the intelligibility of speech or our enjoyment of music . Resonance There are many familiar examples of resonance in everyday things . A pendulum swinging at a constant rate is a resonant system . Other examples are a weight bobbing on a spring , a vibrating string , or the vibrating plates that produce Chladni 's sound figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of a body when it is vibrating at a natural frequency . We have hinted earlier that the frequency of a vibrating string depends upon such factors as tension and string material . Mersenne studied these factors quantitatively , and Brook Taylor ( 1685 ? 1731 ) devised a formula that shows how they determine a vibrating string 's natural freuencIn its modern formTalor 's formula is fll where 1 is the length , T the tension or pull on the string , and M the mass-per-unit length of the string . Taylor 's formula gives the fundamental frequency of a vibrating string . As we have seen , a string can also vibrate at any multiple of that frequency ? its overtones or harmonics . Similarly , any other mechanical system can sustain oscillations at a set of harmonically re lated frequencies determined by the system 's dimensions and other physical properties . Under suitable conditions , a volume of air can also be made to oscillate at its natural frequency . This is precisely what happens when we blow across the top of a milk bottle . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a spring . Air has weight , and Sound , Light and Waves : 131 air has a certain " springiness " or compressibility . With these properties it can be made to oscillate in a manner analogous to the more familiar resonant systems . Music versus Noise Musical instruments are really complex resonators . Consider the wind instruments , for example . Depending upon their size and shape , they emphasize certain frequencies that are put into them by the mouthpiece . If we distinguish between the instrument and its mouthpiece , we can think of a kind of division of labor . The lips pressed over the mouthpiece produce many sounds , and the appropriate fundamental and harmonic tones are emphasized by the properties of the air column in the instrument . This is naturally a great simplification of the theory of musical instruments , but it helps us to understand how resonance fits into everyday things . Because musical instruments depend upon resonance , the sounds they produce are related harmonically . At the opposite extreme is noise , a mixture of sine waves having random frequencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is full of all sorts of noises . When we hear a seemingly unrelated assortment of sounds , we call it noise . Indeed , the distinction between music and noise is sometimes hard to define . One man 's noise may be another man 's music . This confusion was illustrated recently by a British radio station . The announcer told his listeners that the piece to follow was a new composition by the noted young composer so-and-so . What followed was an earsplitting conglomeration of noises in the tradition of a troop of Boy Scouts on a picnic . Various objects and pieces of furniture were banged or dropped during the performance to provide suitable emphasis . Strangely enough , two respected music critics liked the " composition . " We can only conclude that music blends very slowly into noise as the frequency components become more random . At the opposite end of the sound spectrum from pure sine waves , we have a " pure " confusion of sound called " gaussian noise " or " white noise . " It is named after Karl Friedrich Gauss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is called " white " noise 132 . Science , the Never-Ending Quest because it contains all frequencies of sound , just as white light contains all frequencies or colors of light . White noise has a sound like the hiss or shh we hear when a sensitive radio set is tuned between stations with its volume up full . Decibels : Little Numbers for Big Things The ear is capable of distinguishing sounds over an extremely great range of intensities . If we stand a few feet from a sound source having a power of about 100 watts , the sound level seems painfully high . Yet the average ear can still hear the sound if the power is reduced ten million-million times ! Over this entire range of sound levels the ear can make useful comparisons concerning the intensities of different sounds . The ear accomplishes this feat by sensing ratios of sound levels rather than differences in level . To illustrate , consider two experiments in which a sound level is changed . In the first , the sound power is increased from 1 watt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 10 watts to 11 watts . In both examples the difference in power level is 1 watt , but the ear notices a much greater change in loudness for the 1 to 2 watt comparison . To get the same change in subjective loudness for the higher power , the level would have to go from 10 watts to about 20 watts . In other words , it is the ratio of two sound levels that determines the ear 's subjective comparison of loudness . This principle was discovered in 1834 by the German physicist E. H. Weber who extended it to include all of the senses . Weber 's law tells us that a stimulus must be increased by a constant fraction of its intensity or magnitude to be barely noticeable as different . In 1860 , Gustav Fechner gave us a more general rule relating sense perception to stimulus . He tells us that a sensation ( such as apparent brightness , loudness , etc. ) increases by a fixed amount whenever the stimulus ( such as light or sound intensity ) is increased by a constant factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensity , we increase the subjective loudness by a fixed amount . Although neither law holds true exactly , they both emphasize the importance of ratios rather than differences of sound intensities or power levels . Sound , Light and Waves : 133 We take advantage of this principle by using a special number system invented to describe ratios . If one sound is ten times as power-ful as another , we say it is 10 decibels , or 10 db for short , more powerful than the first . If it is 100 times more powerful , it is said to be 20 db stronger than the first . Each time the sound is multiplied by ten , we add 10 db to the decibel figure . A table of sound ratios and corresponding decibel numbers is given below : The general rule for converting power or intensity ratios to decibels is as follows : where Pl and   are the two levels involved . The faintest sound that we can hear has a sound intensity of about one ten-millionth of a billionth of a watt falling on an area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one inch . ) The gentle rustle of leaves is a sound about 10 db greater . An average whisper has a level of about 20 db with respect to the faintest sound . The night noises of a city have a level of around 40 db . Our average department stores run about 60 db and ordinary speech varies between 60 and 70 db . Heavy traffic reaches a level of 85 db and a riveter across the street produces about 100 db . Hammering on a steel plate two feet away produces a level of 115 db . This fantastic range of sound levels covers sounds varying in 134 : Science , the Never-Ending Quest intensity by more than one-hundred billion times . The use of the decibel notation enables us to calculate and discuss such great ratios with numbers that are of convenient size . For the same reason , decibels have been carried over into the field of electricity and radio where similarly large ratios must be dealt with . Their use in connection with national budgets would not be without merit . A Note about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gases ip this chapter and have noticed that wave theory offers an intuitively satisfying explanation of observed phenomena . We have seen that circular motion can be used to generate sinusoidal curves that are somehow related to the way that nature does things . In fact , sine waves seem to represent a simple kind of periodic motion that enables us to analyze and understand much more complex motions . In later chapters , we will find it necessary to apply the theory of waves to light , radio and matter in an attempt to grasp even more subtle methods of nature . If the concept of waves and their behavior is still new and illusive , a rereading of this chapter up to this point may be worthwhile . Much of science is concerned with the motion of energy and matter , and underlying both is the concept of waves . The Importance of Size The wave nature of sound was readily apparent in Newton 's time . The vibratory motion of a sound source could be felt ; there was a ready medium , air ; the observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bending of sound " into the shadow ( called " diffraction " ) was analogous to the action of water waves ; and the resonance of musical instruments could be explained and understood . With the exception of the medium of propagation , air , each of these effects depends upon the size of things . We have noticed that sound and water waves have lengths that are of about the same size as the things around us . This comparative equality was the key to an early understanding of sound . As long as the wavelength is comparable in size Sound , Light and Waves : 135 to the obstacles it meets , the effects of interference or diffraction are relatively large and easy to detect . It is not difficult to notice that sound bends around a corner . An undersanding of light came with greater difficulty because , as we now know , the wavelengths of visible light are unbelievably small in comparison to ordinary things . A particular yellow light in the visible spectrum has a wavelength of about twenty-three millionths of an inch ! This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is placed in a colorless gas flame . The frequency of this light is about five hundred and nine million million vibrations per second ! Because the wavelength of light is so small , light casts a shadow which seems sharp on casual observation . It is not a simple matter to find evidence of the diffraction of light ? the bending of light into the shadow . Similarly , one does not ordinarily connect everyday visual observations with the interference of light or with the effects of resonance . Nevertheless , Hooke gave a crude wave theory of light in 1664 and Newton also ascribed certain wave-like characteristics to light . Although Newton came close to developing the wave theory of light , he did not succeed in doing so ? probably because it did not occur to him that the wavelength might be so exceedingly small . The Diffraction of Light Toward the middle of the seventeenth century , it was apparent to all scientists that . light travels in straight lines or rays . The great successes of the new science of optics were ample evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . Human vision , the laws of perspective , lenses and mirrors all could be explained and understood on the basis of straight rays . Yet , there were disturbing questions left unanswered . Where do the colors come from in soap bubbles ? Or why do we see colors in thin plates of mica or in a thin film of oil on quiet water ? Even more disturbing was a brilliant discovery made by Francesco Grimaldi ( 1618-1663 ) , a Jesuit professor of mathematics at Bologna . In a book published after his death , in 1665 , Grimaldi described a new property of light which he was unable to explain . He observed 136 : Science , the Never-Ending Quest that when light passes through small holes or slits , or when it grazes narrow obstructions like needles and hairs , it produces unusual fringes of colored light where least expected . He also found that light does sometimes bend into the shadow . He called these effects diffraction to distinguish them from refraction . Grimaldi experimented with a narrow beam of sunlight that en tered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beam through two small circular openings , or apertures , AB and CD , as shown in Figure 54 . After passing through the apertures , the light illuminated the screen at the bottom of the diagram . Grimaldi made careful measurements of the hole diameters and distances involved and con cluded that the beam should illuminate an area from F to J in the diagram . A ray from B to C would reach as far to the left as point F , and a ray AD would reach point J on the right . If the law of rectilinear propagation were valid , all points beyond F and J should be in dark ness . He found , however , that the beam of light produced the larger spot on the screen corresponding to the area between E and K. He concluded that light is diffracted or bent into the shadow , and this diffraction can be observed when careful measurements are made . Grimaldi also experimented with tiny opaque bodies placed in the path of his beam . He found that the shadows cast by such bodies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their edges . He accurately described these colored bands Sound , Light and Waves : 137 and pointed out that the color patterns were not the same as those produced by the refraction of light in lenses and prisms . He compared the colored bands to the waves caused by a stone dropping in the water , and supposed that light is a kind of fluid in a state of undulating or wave motion . He also suspected that light traveled at a great but finite speed . In 1665 , the same year Grimaldi 's book was published , Hooke published his Micrographia . One of the more important subjects dis-cussed was the iridescent colors of thin transparent films , such as flakes of mica , soap bubbles , blown glass , oil on water and mother-of-pearl . Hooke noticed that the rainbow colors in thin flakes of mica depend upon the thickness of its various portions . Variations in thick-ness lead to corresponding changes of color which recur in a regular order , much like a number of rainbows placed one above another . He was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass together with a thin air film between them . Although Hooke failed to find a relation between thickness and color , he came to the important conclusion that reflections from both surfaces of a film play a part in producing the colors . He also repeated Grimaldi 's experiments and came to the conclusion that light is " nothing else but a peculiar motion of the parts of the luminous body " that produce motion in a fluid surrounding the body . Although diffraction was by now an experimental fact , there was still no adequate theory capable of explaining it . Ramer and the Speed of Light Although most scientists of the time believed that light traveled at a finite speed , all early attempts to measure it met with failure . The first successful measurement of the speed of light was made in 1672 by the Danish scientist Olaus Romer ( 1644 ? 1710 ) working at the Paris Observatory . Romer measured the period of revolution of one of Jupiter 's moons very accurately and found the Jovian " month " to be about 42 ? hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satellite to make one complete revolution around the planet . He also noticed that the length of the Jovian month was somewhat variable . He found that the satellite 's period ( of revolution ) was 138 . Science , the Never-Ending Quest somewhat longer when the earth was receding from Jupiter than when the two planets were approaching each other . We can understand why this should be so with the help of the accompanying diagram . Imagine Jupiter and the earth to be moving counterclockwise in their orbits as shown in Figure 55 . Jupiter 's moon is observed at a particular place in its orbit when the planets are in the places marked ( 1 ) . The light that an observer sees at that instant must travel a certain distance from Jupiter 's moon to earth . Now imagine that the moon has completed one revolution around Jupiter . During this interval of time , the two planets have moved to new positions in their orbits marked ( 2 ) . ( The planetary movements are greatly exaggerated for clarity . ) In order for light to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel a somewhat longer distance than would have been neces sary if the planets had not moved . The light that signals the comple tion of a Jovian month is delayed to a greater degree than the light that signals its beginning , because of the greater distance the former must travel . This makes the apparent period of the moon somewhat longer than the true figure . Similarly , the period is somewhat shorter than normal when the two planets approach each other . Sound , Light and Waves : 139 On the basis of these observations , Romer calculated that the speed of light must be about 120,000 miles ( or 193,120 kilometers ) per second . The presently accepted figure is 299,792.5 kilometers per second . Romer also estimated that it would take eleven minutes for light to travel from the Sun to the earth . The correct figure is now put at about eight minutes and twenty seconds . Wavelets of Light : A New Idea Romer 's discovery proved that light was not propagated instantaneously , but that it was some kind of process taking place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually based on the assumption that this process ? whatever it might be ? takes place at a different rate in different materials . Grimaldi 's discovery of diffraction , and Hooke 's work with ' iridescence seemed to imply that light involves a kind of wave motion . All of these ideas were molded into a brilliant theory by Huygens in his Traite de la Lumiere ( " A Treatise on Light " ) which was published in 1690 . After almost three hundred years , Huygens ' Traite is still highly recommended reading . Huygens thought of a luminous body such as a candle flame as a vast number of minute particles ( we would say molecules ) which communicate impulses to the neighboring ether . Unlike sound , these impulses originate with each individual particle rather than with the luminous object as a whole . Because the motions of these particles are not related to each other , the many light impulses occur at random times . The " ether " through which they travel is not air ? because light travels through a vacuum ? but an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elastic particles . Each of these particles transmits any light impulses it receives to the particles it touches , but does not encounter any permanent displacement itself . You can illustrate this idea by arranging a few similar coins in a straight line on a table . If you then slide another coin into one end of the line , the coin at the opposite end moves away from the pack . But all of the intermediate coins remain substantially in their original positions . From experiments of this kind , Huygens had learned that many such impulses could cross each other in more complicated 140 . Science , the Never-Ending Quest arrangements of particles without mutual interaction . Using these ideas , he developed a theory of light that explained most of its known properties . As shown in Figure 56 , Huygens imagined that each particle of a flame , such as A , B , or C , sends out a set of concentric , spherical impulses or wavelets . Each moves through the compact particles of the ether without disturbing the others , just as a complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single point of light , A , in Sound , Light and Waves . 141 Figure 57 . The wavelet BC is one of many coming from the source of light . According to Huygens theory , each point on this wavelet can be thought of as a source of new spherical wavelets which are tangent to the curve DE . These secondary wavelets are too weak to produce any effect except in the region where they reinforce each other ? on the surface DE which touches all of them . DE is then a new wave front of the wavelet . Refraction Using these ideas , Huygens was able to account for the rectilinear propagation of light and the existence of shadows . The wave theory also makes it possible to understand refraction , the bending of light that takes place when it passes obliquely from one medium to an-other . Figure 58 shows a series of concentric wave fronts moving through the air from a point-source of light A. ( The direction of 142 : Science , the Never-Ending Quest motion of each wave is perpendicular to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface of a second medium , water , at CD . As a portion of each light wave , such as EF , enters the water , it slows down relative to the portion of the wave in air , FG . This causes the light waves to change direction , all of them seeming to have originated at a point , such as B. The result is a series of waves moving in a direction more nearly perpendicular to the surface . Because light is always refracted toward the perpendicular when it enters a denser material , the wave theory implies a reduction in the speed of light in progressively more dense materials . The corpuscular theory , as we have noted , implies just the opposite relationship for the speed of light . This distinction would ultimately swing science toward the wave theory , when it became possible to measure the speed of light in different materials . But in the absence of any clearcut experimental proof , most scientists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries continued to think of light in terms of Newton 's corpuscular theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory of light in the eighteenth century was the great Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler ( 1707-1783 ) . He improved on Huygens ' theory by supposing that color is determined by the frequency of the corresponding ether vibrations . Color , therefore , is analogous to the pitch of a sound . Sunlight is white because it is made up of light vibrations of every frequency . Euler doubted , however , that it would be possible to measure the frequency or wavelength of these virbrations . On a practical front , Euler discovered an error in Newton 's work that led to improved lenses . When white light is refracted in a prism , the beam is spread out into its individual colors ? a process called " dispersion . " Newton had concluded that the amount of spreading , or dispersion , was independent of the material used to make the prism . It would not be possible , therefore , to combine lenses of suitably chosen materials to eliminate the effects of dispersion . He believed , wrongly , that chromatic aberration ( the colored fringes in lens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflecting telescopes . Sound , Light and Waves : 143 Euler believed , also wrongly , that the human eye was free of chro-matic aberration . He suspected that this apparent lack of dispersion was caused by a suitable combination of several different transparent media in the eye . Although his premise was wrong , his intuition was right , and he succeeded in making a compound lens free of chromatic aberration . As shown in Figure 59 , he assembled two concavoconvex glass lenses which were cemented together at the edges . Water was placed between the two in order to effect the necessary compensation . When the various radii of the lenses were suitably ground , the red and violet rays came together at the same focus . Modern lenses make use of Euler 's principle . Two or more lenses are combined to form an " achromatic lens combination " so that the dispersion of one will be annulled by the other . The individual lenses are made of such materials as crown and flint glasses having different dispersive powers . A typical achromatic lens doublet employs a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flint glass . As shown in the diagram , white light is refracted by the crown glass lens , resulting in a certain amount of dispersion . Only the red and violet rays at the extremes of the spectrum are shown for clarity . The flint glass lens completely overcomes the dispersion of these two rays without overcoming all of the refraction . Both rays then come together at the focus . A practical lens combination of this kind was constructed in 1758 by John Dollond ( 1706-1761 ) , a London optician . Dollond showed experimentally that it was possible to reduce chromatic aber-ration to negligible proportions , so the refracting telescope once again became reinstated in the good opinion of scientists . 144 . Science , the Never-Ending Quest The Inverse Square Law of Light Like many other fundamental laws of nature , the intensity of light varies inversely as the square of the distance from the source . That is , if we double the distance from a light source to a screen , the intensity of the light on the screen falls to one-quarter of its original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intuition . To Pierre Bouguer ( 1698 ? 1758 ) goes the credit for having proved the truth of this law . Bouguer built a photometer or light comparator , as shown in Figure 60 . It consists of three opaque screens arranged in the shape of a Y. Two translucent screens are placed over the round openings F and G in the two sides as shown . Each of these openings was illuminated by one of the two light sources to be compared . The distances AF and BC from each source to its opening was adjusted until the screens at F and G appeared equally bright . By suitable measurements , Bouguer was able to determine that the intensity of a light source falls off as the square of the distance . To illustrate , suppose we have five identical candles , each of which produces the same illumination at the same distance when tested in the photometer . If we place four candles at A so that the distance AF is 20 inches , and the other candle at B , the distance BG will be 10 inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem equally bright . The illumination produced by a candle at A must be one-quarter as great as the illumination of a candle at B. But point A is only twice as far from the screen as point B. The illumination , therefore , depends inversely on the square of the distance . A doubling of the distance reduces the illumination to a quarter of its initial brightness . Similarly , tripling the distance results in one-ninth of the original brightness . In mathematical terms , the intensity , I , is inversely proportional to the square of the distance , r : Unexpected Lines in the Spectrum Newton 's experiments with dispersion , or the spreading of light into its component colors by a prism , indicated a continuous change of hues from red to violet . No one color predominated and each blended gradually into the next . A Scottish physicist , Thomas Melvill ( 1726 ? 1753 ) produced an entirely different kind of spectrum by placing various salts in a flame . He used an opaque screen with a small hole in it to confine this light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a prism to observe its spectrum . For ordinary table salt , he found that the spectrum had a bright yellow spot that predominated in a spectacular manner . This yellow spot was much brighter than the adjacent colors , and the transition at its edge was immediate rather than gradual . We now know that the preponderance of that particular shade of yellow is characteristic of sodium in table salt . Melvill found that various materials emitted other characteristic colors when placed in a hot flame . These observations were not understood at the time , but eventually gave birth to a major field of research , spectroscopy . The telling of that story , however , will have to wait until a later chapter . The Interference of Light The wave theory of light that gained universal acceptance in the nineteenth century was developed by the English physician Thomas 146 : Science , the Never-Ending Quest Young ( 1773-1829 ) . One of the considerations that led him to the wave theory was the fact that light seems to travel at the same speed whether it is intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particles in motion , they would naturally move faster to produce a more brilliant effect . He knew that sound exists in the form of waves , and that soft and weak sounds travel at the same speed . This induced him to experiment with narrow beams of light along the lines origi nated by Grimaldi over one hundred years earlier . Young set up an apparatus similar to that shown in Figure 61 . The vertical dimensions of the diagram are highly magnified for clarity . To simplify our understanding of interference , let 's imagine a source of light at S which emits light of only one color ? a monochromatic light source . This might be a nonluminous flame into which some table salt is fed . Some of that light passes through a small hole 0 in the first screen . This opening serves as a point source of monochromatic light which illuminates two closely spaced pinholes M and N in the second screen . Waves sperad out in all directions from these apertures and overlap on the screen X. The straight lines from M and N @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fronts which are not shown . The three apertures M , N and 0 limit the light striking the screen X to that originating at the same small portion of the light Sound , Light and Waves . 147 source . This means that the waves emerging from M and N came from the same oscillating atoms and must vibrate in synchronism . In scientific terms , the waves are said to be in phase agreement with each other . When the waves reach the screen X , they reinforce each other and produce brightness at certain places marked A , B , and C , and annul each other and produce darkness at other places marked D and E. Reinforcement occurs where the two waves arrive at the screen in phase agreement ; that is , where their respective crests or troughs arrive at the same instant . To reach B , for example , both waves must traverse the same distance , so they arrive at the screen in synchronism and reinforce each other . They also reinforce at points A and C which are located so that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once again the waves arrive in phase agreement and a bright spot occurs . Between the bright spots are points D and E at which the two waves cancel completely , because they arrive at the screen out of phase . The distances between the apertures and point D , for example , differ by exactly one-half wavelength . A crest of one wave arrives simultaneously with a trough of the other , and a dark spot is the result . The alternate arrangement of light and dark spots or " fringes " on the screen is called an " interference pattern . " Such patterns usually consist of many dark and light fringes as the phase relationship of the two waves passes alternately through places of reinforcement and annulment . The distance between fringes is extremely small , and they are usually observed through a low-power telescope . If the pinholes are forty thousandths of an inch apart , the yellow fringes of sodium light are spaced about ten thousandths of an inch apart on a screen one yard away . The Interference of White Light When white light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produces its own interference fringes . Those for red light are spaced about twice as far apart as those for violet because of their 148 : Science , the Never-Ending Quest difference in wavelength . The total pattern is the combined result of all of the colors . We can see similar brilliantly colored designs by looking at a distant light source through a piece of silk or fine-mesh screen , the meshes acting as closely spaced apertures . Young 's brilliant explanation of the interference of light in 1801 started a decline of the corpuscular theory . But this roused the corpuscular school to action , and Laplace succeeded in developing an explanation of interference on the basis of light corpuscles . This achievement would give heart to scientists one hundred years later when corpuscles reentered the theory of light . For the moment , however , corpuscles were approaching their eclipse . The phenomenon that overturned them completely was polarization . Polarized Light When light passes through certain materials , it is changed in a subtle but important way . This phenomenon , called " polarization , " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beam of light passes through two slices of a crystal called tourmaline , cut parallel to the long axis of the crystal . As shown in Figure 62 , we can see light through the crystals when their long axes are parallel . But if one is rotated slightly while the other is kept fixed , the light becomes dim . When the long axes are at right angles to each other , the light is completely stopped and darkness results . Rotation through another right angle restores the original brightness , and the light passes through once again . At first , polarization was difficult to explain with either theory . Young , like the earlier scientists , supposed light to consist of longitudinal waves analogous to those of sound . These , as we shall see , can not be polarized . Water waves are transverse waves in which the water particles move at right angles to the direction of propagation of the wave . The motion of the particles is not random , however . Water waves are polarized in that the water particles can only move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wave motion . They are said to be " vertically polarized " waves because the water particles move up and Sound , Light and Waves : 149 down . Sound waves , which are longitudinal , can not be polarized , because the motion of the air particles can only take place in one direction ? the direction of propagation of the wave . If light waves were longitudinal , the " ether vibrations " could have no preferred direction . The tourmaline crystals could then have no directional properties with regard to light . In 1817 , Young suggested correctly that light waves might be transverse . August Jean Fresnel ( 1788 ? 1827 ) then gave the wave theory its modern form and provided a satisfying explanation of the experiment with tourmaline crystals . Although light waves are trans-verse , they are not necessarily polarized in the vertical direction as are water waves . Light can be thought of as a great number of waves moving through the same space simultaneously . Each is produced by the oscillation of an atom or molecule in an incandescent substance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in one particular direction , but these directions are constantly changing for a particular point . The directions are also randomly different at the same instant for neighboring points . Thus , unpolarized light is really a collection of many polarized rays , in each of which the direc tion or plane of polarization is rapidly changing . This random polariza150 . Science , the Never-Ending Quest tion is illustrated in Figure 63(a) . The observer should imagine a light ray being viewed end-on as it approaches him . The ray is advancing out of the paper at the central point of the diagram . According to Fresnel 's theory , " ether vibrations " take place in all planes passing through the line of advance of the ray . These appear as straight lines 1 ? 1 , 2 ? 2 , etc. , of which six are shown . The length of each line represents the amplitude or maximum excursion of a particle of the vibrating " ether . " The light represented in part ( a ) of the diagram is . called unpolarized light because there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If unpolarized light passes through a material that acts as a grat ing , which is represented schematically by the dotted lines in part ( b ) of the diagram , only those vibrations taking place in one preferred direction will get through without difficulty . Others will be reduced in amplitude , or intensity , to an extent that depends upon their partic ular angle of polarization . Vibrations such as 4 ? 4 at right angles to the grating are almost completely absorbed by the polarizing sub-stance . Light that passes through such a grating is called " polarized light . " When light passes through the first tourmaline crystal in Figure 62 , it becomes polarized in a direction perpendicular to the axis . If both crystals are oriented with their " gratings " in the same direction as in part ( a ) , the polarized light passes through the second crystal with Sound , Light and Waves : 151 little further absorption . But if the two crystals are at right angles , as in ( b ) , all angles of polarization are equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the ability to account for polarization , the wave theory rapidly gained support . The final blow to the corpuscular theory occurred toward the middle of the nineteenth century when it became possible to measure the speed of light in different materials on earth . Direct Measurement of the Speed of Light In 1849 , H. L. Fizeau ( 1819 ? 1896 ) built the first apparatus for measuring the speed of light . The essence of his method is illustrated in Figure 64 . Light from a source S falls on a semitransparent mirror C. Part of it passes straight through and part is reflected through a notch on the cog wheel and on to the mirror A. This light is reflected back through the notch and falls on the mirror C. Once again , part of the returning light passes through the mirror and is seen by the eye . The distance AB in the actual experiment is very much greater than BC . In the description given above , the wheel is assumed to be stopped with a notch in the path of the light beams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the light beam is stopped and the eye sees no reflected light . The cog wheel is then caused to rotate slowly , and the observer notices alternate periods of darkness and light as the notches and teeth move past the path of the light beam . As the speed increases further , the light that reaches the eye becomes dim and finally disappears when a certain speed is reached . To understand why this is so , imagine a light beam moving to the left and passing through a notch on the rotating wheel . This beam travels to the distant mirror A , is reflected , and returns to the vicinity of the wheel . During that interval of time , the wheel has rotated so that a tooth prevents the returning light from passing through and reaching the eye . As the wheel is rotated faster , the light gets brighter again until at a second critical speed the brightness is once again at a maximum . Under these conditions , the wheel moves fast enough so that the returning beam is able to skip the obstructing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quest the adjacent notch . A further increase in speed results in a dimming , and so on . The speed of light measured in this way depends on the distance D from the cogwheel to the mirror on the left , the speed of the cog-wheel n in revolutions per second , and the number of teeth x on the wheel : speed of light = 4nxD where n is the speed corresponding to the first dimming of the light . Using this method , Fizeau found the speed of light to be approximately 186,000 miles per second . Jean Leon Foucault ( 1819 ? 1868 ) re peated the measurement in 1850 using a system of rotating mirrors and obtained a speed agreeing well with Fizeau 's . In addition , Foucault was able to show that the velocity of light in water was less than in air by the ratio of the index of refraction : speed of light in air Speed of light in water = index of refraction of water with respect to air On page 53 we found than n=1.33 for water , so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in water is 186,000 x 1 - or about 140,000 miles per second . 1.33 The fact that light travels slower in more dense materials was the final evidence needed in favor of the wave theory of light . To Victorian scientists , this discovery disposed of the controversy between the corpuscular and wave theories , entirely in favor of the latter . The Ether The preponderance of experimental evidence discussed so far indicates that light behaves as though it were transverse mechanical waves in an elastic medium called the ether . This is quite a different matter from saying that light is that kind of wave motion . Even a few of the nineteenth century scientists felt instinctively the impossibility of transverse vibrations in an ether so rarefied that it can neither be felt nor detected with the most delicate instruments . Nevertheless , the question of mechanical possibility was quite forgotten because it was altogether insignificant compared with the ability of transverse waves to explain polarization , diffraction and refraction . It is one thing to ask what property of light is observed in polarization experiments , and quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The observed property is true , whether it can be explained or not . The ether could not be justified on any experimental basis , yet science felt the need of a medium for light , however unrealistic its properties might have to be . The wave theory accounted for the observed properties of light , but the ether accounted for nothing but the existence of waves . We now believe that light is electrical in nature rather than mechanical , and modern science manages well without an ether . Nevertheless , the demise of the ether was a slow process that extended into the present century . In a later chapter we will discuss the factors that led to a new and more complete understanding of light and its relation to matter and energy . Something in the Air The previous chapters described the high points in man 's successful assault on the problems of time and space measurement . With this success came the ability to navigate routinely over the entire globe . With the world his marketplace , civilized man now had easy access to the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth . World trade had begun to alleviate the want and scarcity that had characterized man 's entire history . Despite his extraordinary success in navigation and timekeeping , man had not significantly increased the number of kinds of things that could be used to satisfy his wants or needs . Only a relatively few plants , animals , and natural substances are directly suitable for food or for the fabrication of useful products . His conquest over nature was one of transportation rather than of innovation of new materials . At the close of the eighteenth century , man 's knowledge of metals , glass making , pottery , dyeing , brewing , weaving and medicine scarcely exceeded that of the ancient peoples of the Mediterranean . He still used the same sail , plough , water wheel and grinding mill that were older than recorded history . The best silks still came from the Orient and the best tin from the British Isles . The only major inventions or new industries that modern man could claim were printing and the manufacture of gunpowder , optical instruments and accurate mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's modest progress in developing new materials , the nineteenth century found him on the verge of a fantastic breakthrough . In the following years , the ordinary citizen would achieve a standard of living that was beyond the comprehension of the ancients . A major factor in that social revolution was the science we call chemistry . Our task now is to trace the steps that led to man 's ability to create wonderful new products and materials out of the most unlikely substances of nature . Chemistry of the Ancients Primitive man collected useful materials from the earth and sea , from rocks , from strange smelling springs , from animals and plants , and he used them to make his metals , fabrics , paints , dyes , perfumes , pottery and medicines . Because the ability to make pure substances came much later , the quality of his products usually depended upon the peculiarities of the raw materials in his region . Gold , silver and copper occur as metals in nature , and their discovery is lost in prehistory . Although all three were treasured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that copper was the most useful of the metals for making practical instruments . The invention of bronze ? an alloy of copper and tin ? did not come along until much later , perhaps 1500 s.c . Although ordinary copper is soft , it becomes much harder after cold-working ? the hammering and bending involved in fashioning an instrument from the cold metal . The use of native copper marks the beginning of every metal culture in man 's progress toward civilization . Much later man learned to smelt the useful red metal from its ores . We can only speculate on the accidental discovery of the process . The green copper carbonate , called " malachite , " was used in ancient Egypt as a cosmetic . If a bit of malachite happened to fall into the charcoal embers of a dying fire , droplets of copper would have formed . Malachite is changed into copper oxide by heat which , in turn , is reduced to pure copper when roasted with the carbon in charcoal . The removal of oxygen from a substance is called " reduction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use . 156 . Science , the Never-Ending Quest Although iron is not found in the native state , man became familiar with it in the form of meteoric fragments from outer space . For a long time , iron was more valuable than gold , because it was scarcer and much more useful . Beads of meteoric iron were used in Egypt for jewelry before 3400 B.C. Separating the metal from its ore seems to have been achieved by the Hindu 's about 2000 B.C. Once again , a number of pigments such as hematite are rich in iron in combination with oxygen . So the extraction of iron from the ore may have been accomplished by analogy with the smelting of copper . The tin used to make bronze can also be obtained from its common ores by removing oxygen . So early metallurgy began with the " reduction " of the ores now called oxides or carbonates by roasting them with charcoal in a closed chamber . Many ores do not succumb to reduction alone , however . The ores we call " sulphides " ? combinations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step . Some of these ores can be reduced to the metal if they have been previously roasted in air . We call that process " oxidation , " the addition of oxygen to a substance . It must soon have been observed that oxidation is facilitated if fresh air is continually supplied to the hot ore . The bellows then followed and with it came the first crude blast furnaces . It may also have been noticed that certain iron ores containing limestone more readily form a molten mass . These crafts were practiced thousands of years ago , but their true nature remained a mystery until the nineteenth century . How to Materialize Invisible Spirits In addition to reduction and oxidation , we also owe the process of distillation to the ancients . This process , which was known to the Alexandrians , is used to separate substances from each other on the basis of their individual characteristics . A traditional still is shown in Figure 65 . The impure material to be separated is placed in the receptacle A and heated . Some of it then seemingly disappears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevented from escaping by the retort B. They then materialize and collect in the receiver C. Today we know that various substances boil I Something in the Air . 157 off as vapors at characteristic temperatures . By maintaining the mixture in A at an appropriate temperature , the constituent having the lowest boiling temperature can be separated out while others remain in the liquid state . The nature of this process remained a mystery until recent times . When substances like alcohol or water were heated , they were thought to disappear and become " spirits " ? a term that persists to this day . The task of the alchemist was to cause these " spirits " to materialize . In medieval times the substances we call gases and vapors were not recognized as the third state of matter . Only two states were acknowledged : the solid and the liquid . The ancient philosophers could not understand that the third state of matter is the connecting link between the smelting of metals and the distillation of alcohol . The physics of Aristotle taught that air has no weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of matter . As in the other exact sciences , an ancient Aristotelian hurdle would have to be cleared before order could emerge out of the chaos of alchemical recipes . The Early Ideas of Matter As we might expect , the science of chemistry has its historical roots in the minds of the early Greek philosophers . The first of these 158 . Science , the Never-Ending Quest that is known to us is Thales of Miletus ( about 600 B.C. ) , the great Greek geometer . In Thales we find the universal scientific desire to reduce the seemingly unrelated phenomena of nature to a certain unity . Thales believed that there must be one primary matter from which everything has developed by a gradual process of change or differentiation . He thought that water must be that primary matter . The line of thought that led Thales to that conclusion , unfortunately , has been lost to us . Neither do we know why his colleague , Anaximenes of Miletus ( about 585 ? 528 B.C. ) , advanced air as the primary matter of all things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered fire as the primary matter of nature . He was struck by the continuous change he noticed in all things . The only reality , therefore , is change itself . To be is to change . He chose fire as the building block of matter because it does not remain identical with itself even for a single instant . Radically opposed to Heraclitus was his contemporary , Parmenides , a philosopher of Elea , a Greek colony in Southern Italy . According to Parmenides , reality is unchanging , and change is nothing but an illusion . It is not important for our purpose to follow Parmenides ' line of reasoning in arriving at that conclusion . Like many subsequent philosophers who dabbled in science , Parmenides used unassailable logic to arrive at precisely the wrong conclusion . He denied all value to sense perception and argued that all truth must originate in the mind . We have already noticed the extent to which that contempt for the experimental method has hindered scientific development . Plato was its great exponent , but Parmenides was its author . The Atoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if unfortunate , impression upon his contemporaries . Greek science had boldly set out to explain the changing phenomena in nature , and Parmenides had convinced his colleagues that these changes are impossible . The first task faced by Democritus ( about 460 B.C. ) , therefore , was to explain how changes are possible at all . He believed that even if all change were an illusion , that illusion , at any rate , would require an explanation . Something in the Air . 159 Democritus taught that the things which are unchanging and indivisible are atoms , the constituents of all matter . All else is a void or vacuum as we might say . By admitting the void , Democritus allowed his atoms to be separate and to move about . Change is nothing but the union or separation of unchangeable atoms . A substance can only change when its atoms unite with other atoms or become separated from each other . Whatever differences we perceive in a thing are based upon differences in size , shape or position of its atoms . The atomic theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of experimental evidence . More than two thousand years later , his ideas would develop into a physical theory that would be tested in the laboratory . But the Golden Age of Greece was not yet the time for such a development . The Elements of Empedocles According to Empedocles ( about 450 B.C. ) , there are four basic constituents of everything ? air , fire , earth , and water . Each of these elements is unchanging , and all substances contain them in varying proportions . A substance changes when the proportions of its constituent elements change . The selection of earth , water , air and fire as the building blocks of all matter is really not as strange as it seems on first thought . They are obviously analogous to solids , liquids , gases and fire ? a classification that comes naturally when we consider the material world . Neither should we imagine that the elements of Empedocles are the ordinary earth , water , air and fire that we know so well . In real life we find the elements only in combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theory , contains a preponderance of elemental water , but also small amounts of the other three elements . The true elemental water is merely the essence of water ? something we can never perceive . The Seeds of Anaxagoras Anaxagoras , who lived about the time of Empedocles , conceived of an unlimited number of different primitive elements which he 160 . Science , the Never-Ending Quest called " seeds . " His seeds were eternal and unchanging . A substance changes when its seeds become separated from each other , or when they unite with different seeds . The main difference between the theory of Anaxagoras and that of Democritus was the fact that every Anaxagorean substance contained all possible kinds of seeds . Their properties depended upon the type of seed that happened to predominate . The Elements and Compounds of Aristotle Although Aristotle was a poor physicist , he was an excellent observer . He firmly believed that any theory should be based on general experience . He attacked the atomic theory of Democritus at every opportunity , because it did not seem to fit with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire , earth , water and air of Empedocles and accepted them into his own theory . Where his predecessors had been content to talk about change in general terms , Aristotle became specific . In his books On Generation and Corruption and On the Soul , he gives a logical derivation of the four elements . He argues that touch is the primary sense ? a notion that we have previously come across in connection with optics . The primary qualities of the primary elements , therefore , must be observable by the sense of touch . These primary qualities or properties are cold and warm , wet and dry . There are only six pairs of combinations of these four properties : warm-cold , warm-dry , warm-wet , cold-dry , cold-wet and dry-wet . The first and last of these combinations are trivial , so they can be neglected , leaving only four . As shown in Figure 66 , the four elements are then supposed to be related to the four properties as follows : warm-dry fire warm-wet air cold-dry earth cold-wet water Aristotle 's derivation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmly convinced that it was based on experience . Whether we consider his arguments convincing or not , his ideas of Something in the Air : 161 change are certainly based on a more solid foundation than those of Democritus . Right or wrong , however , Aristotle 's theory would be the basis of chemical thought for two thousand years . Aristotle also differed from Democritus in his concept of a chemical compound . He argued that the formation of a common substance from the basic elements is more than a coming together of the ele ments . The elements themselves are changed when they combine with each other . Chemical combination of elements is the " coming to be one of the changed reagents . " This statement would later give rise to a great controversy concerning whether or not the elements continue to exist as such in chemical compounds . Aristotle vs . Democritus The Greeks were not content with a piecemeal explanation of nature . A theory had to grasp all phenomena in a single intellectual embrace . Although we did not mention it earlier , Democritus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul is made . The soulatoms are fine and round , and can penetrate the entire body . They cause the body 's motion and vital functions . Even thought could be reduced to a motion of these soul-atoms . Democritus ' system is classified as materialism , because everything in nature is explained on material principles . This helps us understand why Plato , Aristotle and most thinkers for two thousand years rejected his ideas . They could not accept a philosophy which reduced the noble achievements of the mind to a mere motion of material atoms . Not until the great scientific awakening of the seventeenth 162 . Science , the Never-Ending Quest century would men begin to suspect that Aristotle had been wrong again . Alchemy in Islam Long before the Christian era , the Egyptians had acquired great skill in extracting and working with metals . They had also become adept in the surface coloring of metals and in the preparation of alloys that counterfeited the appearance of gold and silver . In Alexandria , this knowledge was combined with the astrology and magic of the Babylonians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fusion of knowledge , speculation and mysticism passed to Syria and Persia and later , in the seventh century , to Arabia . The Arabs took the Greek word chemeia , which referred to the counterfeiting of gold and silver , prefixed the Arabic article al , and gave us the word alchemy . The fundamental premises of alchemy were as follows : 1 . All matter is made up of a mixture of earth , air , water and fire in various mixtures . 2 . Gold is the noblest and purest of the metals and silver is next . 3 . Any metal can be changed into another , a process called transmutation , by changing the proportions of the four basic elements . The alchemists believed that the transmutation of a base metal to gold could be achieved by using an elusive substance called the philosopher 's stone . They also believed in an elixir of life and a panacea . The former would prolong life indefinitely and the latter would cure all of its ills . These objectives of alchemy were as real to the Arabian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiber to the modern chemist . But we should not think of alchemy as merely a mass of fantastic superstitions . The alchemists have been adequately slandered by superficial evaluations of their accomplishments . If we bypass the inevitable mysticism and charlatanism , there is much of value to be found in Arabian alchemy . Its contribution ? and it was an indispensable one ? was the many centuries of trying all possible combinations of known substances ; of rejecting those which do not interact , and slowly and methodically recording the recipes of those that do . WithSomething in the Air : 163 out this patient research ? regardless of its motive ? chemistry could not have become a science . A typical alchemical recipe was that given for a pottery glaze by Jabir ( c. 760 ? 815 ) , an Arabian alchemist who became known to Europeans as Geber . He writes in his Book of Properties : Take a pound of litharge ( a compound of lead and oxygen ) , powder it well and heat it gently with four pounds of wine vinegar until it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound of soda and heat it with four pounds of water until the volume is halved . Filter the two solutions until they become clear and then gradually add the solution of soda to that of the litharge . A white substance is formed that settles to the bottom . Pour off the water and let the residue dry . It will become a salt as white as snow . This material is white lead , used for centuries as a pottery glaze and as a paint . The greatest of the Arabic alchemists was Rhazes ( 865 ? 925 ) whose name means " man of Ray , " a town in Persia . One of his books outlines the equipping of a laboratory . His suggestions for equipment include , among other things : A laboratory so equipped is hardly a mere wizard 's den . Rhazes was familiar with many chemicals , including possibly sulphuric and nitric acid . He was also the first to classify matter as either animal , vegetable or mineral . He classified the latter into six subclasses : ( l ) spirits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on heating ; ( 2 ) seven metals ; ( 3 ) six boraxes which include our borax ; ( 4 ) eleven salts which include sea-salt , lime , potash and a few of our alkalis ; ( 5 ) thirteen stones including malachite ( copper oxide ) , hematite ( iron oxide ) , gypsum ( calcium suphate ) and alum ; and ( 6 ) six vitriols , certain compounds of a metal , sulphur and oxygen having a glassy appearance . 164 . Science , the Never-Ending Quest The Moorish alchemists that followed made further advances in the classification of chemicals . They recognized solutions of acids , salts and alkalis according to their effect on vegetable dyes that were used on fabrics . One of the dyes was called " litmus , " now familiar to all students of chemistry . Litmus paper turns red when dipped in an acid , or blue when dipped in a solution of an alkali ( our " bases " like lye and quicklime ) . The Moorish alchemists also gave recipes for the three important acids of modern industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by distilling the vapors formed when various salts were heated . European Alchemy The sixteenth century saw the leadership of alchemy pass from Islam to Europe . Here it acquired a nobler aim under the influence of a Swiss physician , Aureolus Philippus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim , also known more concisely as Paracelcus ( 1493-1541 ) . He was a man of violent , boastful and rebellious temper whose major contribution was a redirection of chemical effort into more fruitful channels . He turned his followers from the obsession of gold making , " the deceitful and mischievous art of alchemy , " to a study of medi-cines . He taught that the true aim of alchemy should be the curing of human illness and disease through the study and devolpment of new drugs . His ideas inaugurated a new era in chemistry known as iatrochemistry or medical chemistry . This new field acted as a bridge between alchemy and the beginnings of an exact science of chemistry in the seventeenth century . Chaos in Chemistry The vital importance of air to chemical processes received its first recognition by Johann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He showed experimentally that there are many kinds of gases and all are material in nature . He actually introduced the term " gas " which he derived from chaos . He had no way of collecting a gas and identifying it , so his descriptions were often incomplete . Something in the Air : 165 Nevertheless , he became convinced that there are many kinds of gases all having different properties . This was quite an advance over the previous idea that air is the only substance of its kind . He enumerated many gases : windy gas ( air ) , wild gas ( carbon dioxide , the gas in soda pop ) , smoky gas , dry gas , etc . He described these gases in a rough kind of way based on their more obvious physical properties . He seems to have been the first chemist to suspect that the destructive power of gunpowder was caused by the gases it produces . Jean Rey , who lived about 1630 , was the first to recognize that air is somehow involved in the calcination ( oxidation ) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that oxygen combines with the metal to form a new compound called an oxide , but this process was beyond the comprehension of Rey 's predecessors . Rey tells us that a certain apothecary asked him why tin and lead increase in weight when calcined in air . In reply , Rey " devoted several hours to the question , " during which he wrote twenty-eight essays on the subject which he let " slip from his hands . " His major contribution to chemistry was the idea that all things , including air , have weight . Referring to the apothecary , he tells us that having placed two pounds six ounces of fine English tin in an iron vessel and heated it strongly on an open furnace for six hours . . . he recovered two pounds thirteen ounces of a white calx . Where did the extra seven ounces come from ? Why . . . , from the air , which in the vessel has been rendered denser , heavier , and in some measure adhesive , by the vehement and continual heat of the furnace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aiding ) and becomes attached to its most minute particles : not otherwise than water makes heavier sand which you throw into it and agitate , by moistening it and adhering to the smallest of its grains . Despite the importance of Rey 's idea , three things spoil it for us as they probably did for his contemporaries : ( 1 ) he gave no proof that the extra weight was caused by the air ; ( 2 ) he described the air as combining with the white calx rather than the metal ; and ( 3 ) he compares the process to a mixture of water and sand . Although Rey missed the full significance of the union of air and a metal , he was convinced that air has weight . The followers of Aristotle argued that air is weightless because a bladder full of air weighs no more than a flat empty bladder . Rey replied that " only the veriest 166 : Science , the Never-Ending Quest clown " would attach any significance to such a measurement . He pointed out that measurements of weight are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in water . " It is from this , " he wrote , " that the error I have fought ( that air is weightless ) draws an argument that may dazzle feeble eyes , though not clear-seeing ones . For , weighing air in air itself , and finding no weight in it , they believed that it had none . But let them weigh water ( which they believe to be heavy ) in water itself , and they will find no weight in it either ; the fact being that no element shows weight when weighed in itself . " Rey had become the first scientist to clearly understand that Archimedes ' principle of buoyancy applies to air as well as to a liquid . If we weigh an ordinary cooking pan in air , its weight is not increased by the amount of air it contains . It would weigh precisely the same amount if the pan were crumbled into a compact mass which contains little or no air . Notice , however , that Rey proved only that air may have weight ; he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demolished the Aristotelian arguments against the possibility that air might have weight . Shortly after Rey 's essays appeared , the air pump was invented . The weight of air might have been proved conclusively , if someone had merely weighed a container when it was full of air and when it was empty . But no one thought of doing it . The great discovery that air is weighty matter was made by Torricelli , a student of Galileo . Why Nature Abhors a Vacuum In Galileo 's Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences , he illustrates how an everyday observation ? long overlooked by philosophers ? might have led to a more accurate understanding of the air . I once saw a cistern which had been provided with a pump . . . The stock of the pump carried its sucker ( piston ) and valve in the upper part so that the water was lifted by attraction and not by a push as is the case for pumps having the sucker placed lower down ( the cistern ) . This pump worked perfectly so long as the water in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that level , the pump failed to work . When I first noticed this phenomenon , I thought the pump was out of order ; but the workman whom I called in to repair it told me the defect was not in the pump Something in the Air : 167 but in the water ( level ) which had fallen too low to be raised through such a height ; and he added that it is not possible , either by a pump or by any other machine working on the principle of attraction , to lift water a hair 's breadth above eighteen cubits ; whether the pump be large or small , this is the extreme limit of the lift . Galileo was referring to the common " suction " pump shown in Figure 67 . Raising the piston as in part ( a ) increases the volume of the chamber , but the leather washer of the piston prevents air from entering the chamber from above . Water rises into the chamber because the atmospheric pressure on the surface of the water in the well is greater than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part ( b ) , the valve is forced closed and the water pushes past the leather washer into the space above the piston . The next upstroke , in part ( c ) , admits additional water into the chamber while discharging some of the water above the piston . In Galileo 's time , scientists believed that water is sucked into a pump because nature abhors a vacuum ? the age-old horror vacui . Galileo was the first to wonder why this abhorrence stopped suddenly at a height of eighteen cubits , or about thirty-two feet as we would say . This was obviously an " effect " that cried out for a " cause . " 168 . Science , the Never-Ending Quest This prompted Evangelista Torricelli ( 1608 ? 1647 ) , Galileo 's pupil , to speculate on the height to which the horror vacui could raise a column of mercury . He knew that mercury is about fourteen times as heavy as water , so he suspected that the height would be onefourteenth of the 18 cubits , or about 2 ? feet . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet long which was sealed at one end . The tube was filled with mercury and the open end stopped with a finger . The tube was then inverted and placed with the stopped end dipping into an open pan of mercury ( Figure 68 ) . When the finger was removed , the mercury in the tube sank to a height of about thirty inches above the surface of the mercury in the pan . No air could have entered the tube , so the clear space above the mercury column was subsequently named the " Torricellian Vac uum . " Torricelli suspected that the column of mercury was supported by the pressure of the atmosphere pushing on the free surface of the mercury . He attributed minor variations in the column 's height from day to day to changes in atmospheric pressure . Later , Blaise Pascal ( 1623 ? 1662 ) found that the height of the column was steadily reSomething in the Air . 169 duced as the apparatus was carried up a mountain . Torricelli 's instrument is now called a barometer . The Principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by supposing that air has weight . Imagine a column of air , as shown in Figure 69 , having a cross section area of one square inch . The column extends in length from the earth 's surface to the top of the atmosphere . We now know that such a column of air weighs 14.7 pounds , if we neglect the small variations that occur from day to day . Every other column of air having the same cross section area weighs precisely the same amount . It is convenient , therefore , to speak of the pressure of the air ? the weight , or force , acting on a unit of area . The pressure of the atmosphere is simply 14.7 pounds per square inch . Notice that the pressure is independent of the cross section area we choose to consider . If we select an area of 10 square inches , the air column weighs ten times as much and the pressure is exactly the same . 170 : Science , the Never-Ending Quest We owe the next step in our understanding of the barometer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a fluid ( a liquid or gas ) is transmitted equally in all directions . He knew that the atmosphere pushes down on the open surface of the mercury with a pressure of 14.7 pounds per square inch ( see Figure 68 ) . According to Pascal 's principle , this pressure is exerted everywhere in the mercury . It also acts in the mercury at the bottom of the tube . But there is no air in the top of the tube capable of pushing down on the mercury column . The atmospheric pressure at the bottom of the tube is balanced only by the column of mercury . Because mercury is so much heavier than air , a thirty-inch column weighs precisely the same as a column of air of the same cross section area that extends to the top of the atmosphere . The two columns balance each other exactly because both produce the same pressure on the reservoir of mercury . How to Weigh the Air Using the air pump , both von Guericke and Boyle later verified the fact that air has weight . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after the air had been pumped out of it . Both scientists found that the container lost weight when the air was removed . Boyle found that " the proportion in gravity ( weight ) of air to water of the same volume will be as 1 to 938 . " In his Discourses and Demonstrations on Two New Sciences , Galileo measures the ratio to be 1:400 . The true figure for air at room temperature and at sea level is about 830 . The Spring of the Air Boyle published the results of his experiments with the air pump ( his " new pneumatical engine " ) in 1660 . These experiments suggested to him that air has a certain springiness . Pressure applied to a confined volume of air causes the air to become compressed into a smaller volume . When that pressure is removed , the air recovers its previous volume . Something in the Air . 171 After reading Boyle 's book , Richard Towneley suggested to the author an hypothesis " that supposes the pressures and expansions to be in reciprocal ( inverse ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that doubling the pressure on air would reduce its volume to one-half . Boyle soon proved that Towneley 's idea was correct , and it has be-come known as Boyle 's law . Boyle used a bent glass tube for his experiment as shown in part ( a ) of Figure 70 . The short leg of the tube was hermetically sealed and the long end was open to the atmosphere . He then poured mercury in the tube and " by frequently inclining the tube , " allowed some of the trapped air in the closed leg to escape . After much adjustment , the mercury rose to exactly the same height in each leg . The pressure of the air in the closed leg was then necessarily the same as the pres-sure of the atmosphere pressing on the mercury in the open leg . If the two pressures had been unequal , the mercury would not have risen so high in the leg having the higher pressure . Boyle concluded , 172 . Science , the Never-Ending Quest therefore , that the air in the closed leg had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch . He then poured in additional mercury as in part ( b ) of the dia gram until the air in the shorter leg was by condensation ( compression ) reduced to take up but half of the space it possessed . . . before ; we cast our eyes upon the longer leg of the glass . . . and we observed not without delight and satisfaction that the quicksilver ( mercury ) in the longer tube was 29 inches higher than the other . We can understand this result by recalling Torricelli 's experiment . The air pressing on the mercury in the open leg of part ( a ) is equal in pressure to a column of mercury about 29 or 30 inches high , de-pending upon atmospheric pressure . Such a column of mercury would produce a pressure of I atmosphere , the initial pressure in the closed leg . In part ( b ) , Boyle found that a column of mercury 29 inches high reduced the volume of trapped air to one half its initial volume . To this 29 inches , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercury to which the atmosphere is equivalent . The atmos phere , after all , is still pushing down on the mercury in the open leg . It 's clear , therefore , that the pressure of the trapped air in part ( b ) is about twice the pressure of the same air in part ( a ) . Also , the reduction in volume was produced by a doubling of the pressure acting upon the trapped air . Boyle repeated the experiment for many pressures and volumes and found that the volume was always inversely proportional to the applied pressure . In mathematical terms , where k is a constant of proportionality depending upon the units in which volume and pressure are measured . Something in the Air : 173 The Beginning of Scientific Chemistry The alchemists , iatro-chemists and metallurgists had achieved important practical results by the middle of the seventeenth century , but they had done little to promote a scientific understanding of chemical processes . The development of the science of chemistry is a classic example of the interdependence of experiment and theory . It emphasizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas that lead to understanding and unity . Although Aristotle 's theories were sterile without experimental proof , the use of experimentation without theoretical guidance was blind . Before a science could grow out of the known mass of chemical facts , a theory would have to evolve that was in closer agreement with experience . Three major stumbling blocks stood in the way of chemical evolution . The first was the still unrecognized fact that air ? now a weighty substance ? enters into many chemical processes as an unseen constituent or reagent . The second was the erroneous belief that fire is the universal element of " analysis " by which chemical compounds are separated into their elements . The third was the severe limitation placed on theorists by the small number of basic elements . The Aristotelians , or Peripatetics , still believed in the four ancient elements of Empedocles : earth , water , air and fire . The followers of Paracelcus favored three other " principles " or elements : salt , sulphur , and mercury . Depending upon personal preference , others selected one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic elements led to an assignment of the same name to many different substances . Also , the lack of an agreed upon list of elements and compounds led to confusion and lack of mutual understanding among chemists . The fact that " occult qualities , " " spirits " and " substantial forms " were invoked to explain chemical reactions confirmed the general view that chemistry was a kind of magic , or at best an art . Galileo 's research in mechanics had established a model of scientific inquiry in an allied science . It was now time for a critical reappraisal of the common chemical theories of the time . Also needed 174 : Science , the Never-Ending Quest was a scientific method of conducting and interpreting chemical experiments . Boyle and Hooke stepped into this intellectual void and laid the foundations of the science of chemistry . The " Sceptical Chymist " Of the many books written by Boyle , the most important is The Sceptical Chymist which appeared in 1661 . Boyle began by attacking the idea that there are only a small number of fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world to a man trying to decipher a book in which " he were acquainted with but three letters . " " The Book of Nature , " he observed , may need many more than three or four elements for its understanding . Boyle had finally swept away the Greek idea that chemistry , like geometry , could be developed logically from a few self-evident principles . He went on to divide all pure substances into two classes . One class contains those which had , so far , resisted all attempts to decompose them , or to break them up into substances that were simpler than themselves . These he called the true " elements . " The second class of pure substances are those which , by one means or another , can be decomposed into simpler substances . These he called " compounds . " The idea that theoretical preconceptions must give way to experimental facts had finally found a champion among the chemists . Boyle also attacked the notion that fire is the universal method of separating all compounds into their elements . He pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though all chemists knew that it contains minerals ( sand and lime ) and the ashes of burned plants ( soda or potash ) . He argued that even when fire does separate a substance into new chemicals , these are not necessarily elements . To illustrate , wood gives soot and ashes when burned , but oil , spirits , water and charcoal when distilled . All of these substances are surely not elements . Boyle also noticed the importance of air in chemical reactions . If coal is burned in the open air it is calcined to ashes , but it is not calcined at all if it is heated red hot in a closed vessel . His interest in air and fire almost led Boyle to the discovery of oxygen . He realized Something in the Air : 175 that only a part of the air was necessary for combustion : " There may be dispensed through the rest of the atmosphere some odd substance ... on account of which the air is so necessary to the subsistence of flame . " With the help of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air is necessary to animal life . Although he failed to identify these " parts " of the air , he did give birth to the idea of a vital substance contained in the air . One hundred years later , Lavoisier would show that oxygen is necessary both for life and for combustion . Hooke and others extended Boyle 's ideas in the fields of combustion and respiration . Hooke showed that the part of the air used up by a flame is the same part used up in breathing . He also demonstrated that a mouse would live longer in a jar of compressed air than in one at ordinary pressure . In 1663 Wren suggested that air contains " nitrous fumes " which sustain life , and Hooke extended the concept to include combustion . In 1665 Hooke showed experimentally that seeds need air for their growth . Much progress had been made since the invention of the barometer and the air pump . Air had become known as a material substance that supports life and influences certain chemical reactions . It represented a third state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? was a characteristic of matter in the airy state . The theory of matter had to take account of this fact . Democritus had taught that matter consists of discrete atoms separated by empty space , a concept that fitted well with the observation of compression . So the atomic view seemed more plausible than in earlier times . The time seemed right for a great theoretical development in chemistry , but it did not come until much later . Heat , for example , was still a chemical element instead of a branch of physics . Unlike air , " spirits " were still not understood to be chemical substances in the gaseous state . The strokes of insight that did occur here and there were apt to be smothered in mere speculation and lost to other scientists . Communication was poor between chemists because of a tradition of secrecy and a lack of precise terminology with which to communicate . Improvements in these areas were just then taking place in mechanics under the influence of Newton and others . Nevertheless , chemists had no ade176 . Science , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventeenth century physicists . It would take a century of groping before the precision of physics would find its way into the art of chemistry . The chemical revolution could not occur until chemists had learned enough physics to keep both sciences constantly before their minds . The First Synthetics 9 Logs burning in the living room fireplace or in a campfire under the stars give a friendly , inviting warmth . But that is the extent of our dependence upon wood for heat . Coal , oil , gas and electricity have long since relegated wood to a minor role . It was not always so , however . Toward the end of the seventeenth century wood was still the basic source of energy for home and industry . And that source was rapidly being depleted . Great quantities of wood , or charcoal made from wood , were being consumed in the smelting of metals from their ores ; in refining sugar ; in making starch ; in firing pottery , tiles , bricks and pipes ; in drying malt and hops ; in making soap , glass and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need for timber increased , the land available for planting trees diminished . An anonymous authority tells us that in all countries near the sea , " most of the woods are consumed and the ground converted to corn and pasture . " All industries that depended upon wood were forced into a search for material substitutes . One of these was the smelting of iron . Unlike tin and lead , iron could not be separated from its ore with ordinary coal . But a substitute for charcoal was found in coke , a steel-gray , hard substance consisting almost entirely of the element carbon . An excellent reducing agent , coke is still indispensable in the smelting of iron . It is made by heating coal above 2000 ? F in a closed space for six-177 178 . Science , the Never-Ending Quest teen hours while coal gas and other substances are driven from the coal . The white-hot coke is then removed from the oven and quickly quenched in cold water to prevent it from burning up . Each ton of coal yields 1,400 pounds of coke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the eighteenth century this gas came into general use for the illumination of buildings and streets . Synthetic Pot-ashes Other industries that found themselves searching for material substitutes were the manufacture of glass and soap . Substances called potash and soda ( or soda ash ) were widely used in these industries . Potash ( now called potassium carbonate ) was obtained from the ashes of burned land vegetation , and soda ash ( called sodium carbonate ) was derived from the ashes of plants that grow near the sea . These chemicals were formerly obtained by collecting water that had passed through the ashes , evaporating the water , and heating the residue in pots ? hence the name " potashes . " Because of a shortage of these alkaline substances , the Academy of Paris offered a prize for a process of converting common salt , sodium chloride , to sodium carbonate , or soda . The prize was won by a French chemist , Nicolas Leblanc , who established a factory in 1791 for the manufacture of soda . The factory was confiscated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , filled with despair , Leblanc committed suicide . That was the reward he received for giving the world cheap soap and glass . Bleaching Water Chemical research also received encouragement from other sources . The acid made from sulfur , oxygen and water ( sulfuric acid ) was useful in the bleaching of linen and the refining of precious metals . The middle of the eighteenth century found sulfuric acid being produced by new methods of mass production that greatly reduced its cost . Later in the century , it became the basic raw material of the glass and soap industries as a chemical of the Leblanc process . The First Synthetics . 179 In 1774 Scheele discovered a gas , chlorine , that was also derived from a chemical process involving sulfuric acid , and noticed its great bleaching power . Berthollet dissolved the gas in water in 1785 and found that the solution also had bleaching power . Berthollet 's work founded the new bleaching industry . White China Another industry that created a demand for chemical knowledge was the manufacture of china and earthenware . Different colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate varieties of clay . But , then as now , the housewife insisted on pure white china . Difficulties often arose , however , because of metallic compounds in the earth . Certain clays could be rendered white on firing only by removing these impurities . It was well known , for example , that iron oxide imparts a yellow or red color to what would otherwise be white china . By the end of the eighteenth century , vendors of clay had learned to remove such impurities by chemical means . The Search for Saltpeter The manufacture of gunpowder shared in the fruits of chemical research . Of the three constituents of black gunpowder ? charcoal , sulfur and saltpeter ? the latter was always in short supply . Charcoal was derived from wood and sulfur from volcanic deposits . But saltpeter , or potassium nitrate as we would say , was of animal origin . Saltpeter , or nitrate , forms naturally in the decomposition of manure heaps . There were few places in Europe where saltpeter could collect without being carried away by rain water . Consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there was considerable animal waste-material undergoing decomposition . As early as 1540 , French officers , called salpetriers commissiones , were given the unenviable task of searching for and extracting saltpeter wherever it could be four ' During the reign of Louis XIII ( 1610 ? 1643 ) the
