It is never too soon to begin thinking about the next presidential election , and Governor George Romney is one Republican who , fairly obviously , has started thinking . Romney has already started observing several tried and true rules for early season aspirants . <P> One rule is to go around the country making speeches-preferably " nonpolitical " and therefore noncontroversial . Since Jan. 1 , Romney has had seven such engagements , including two Lincoln Day addresses . The subject : " moral principles . " For example , he told a newspaper association meeting that " our drift away from principle , too often encouraged by the recurring examples of opportunism and expediency in high office , has produced corrosive contradictions within our national life that can destroy our free institutions . " <P> Another rule is to talk up party unity . In the past , Romney has talked more often of " citizens ' participation " than of the Republican Party . But no longer . He takes seriously his assignment as member of the postelection G.O.P. Coordinating Committee , and is seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong and resolute center . " We need to strengthen the Republican Party , " he told a press conference in Detroit . " We need some coordinating thinking . " <P> Another rule is to travel abroad , thereby achieving an aura of expertise in world affairs . At the end of April Romney will go to Europe with a group of Michigan businessmen . The experience will no doubt give Romney some new foreign-affairs talking points upon his return . <P> Still another rule requires that a potential candidate play an active role in key issues on which there is a national consensus . Romney was the first major political personality to lead a civil rights sympathy march last month after the Selma violence . Only last week , he visited the husband of Viola Liuzzo , told him that his wife was " like Joan of Arc . " <P> A final rule is to round up party allies by enhancing the politician 's eternal dream of even higher office . Last week during a trip to Washington to attend a Governors ' dinner at the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Republican Senator Jacob Javits , a longtime supporter of Governor Nelson Rockefeller . It may have been coincidence , but Jack Javits the day before announced that he will not support a Rockefeller drive for the presidential nomination in 1968 . And it is neither a coincidence nor a secret that Javits would love to be Vice President of the U.S. some day .
