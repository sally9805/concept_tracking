Abruptly , just as he was about to catch a train , Charles de Gaulle last week gave up his legal authority to be near dictator of France . A few hours before leaving for his first whistle-stop tour since a terrorist 's bomb came within a damp fuse of killing him , De Gaulle issued a brief communiqu . As of Oct. 1 , he announced , he would relinquish the extraordinary powers he had assumed* to quell the Algerian army revolt in April . <P> De Gaulle 's stated reason , that the major phase of squaring accounts with the rebels was ending ( some have been tried in absentia ) , told only part of the story . Eying the increasingly restive French National Assembly , the General was loading a weapon specifically denied to him under emergency rule but normally available under the constitution : the President 's right to dissolve the Assembly and call new elections . To appease a vociferous farm lobby , De Gaulle allowed the winter price of milk to go up 4% . <P> Then , knowing a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his special presidential train to test his personal strength in the farm country of south central France . <P> Hold Intact . For his 14th tour since becoming President ( he has stumped 60 of France 's 90 departments ) , De Gaulle tackled the depressed " French desert " of Rouergue , a mountainous land of tiny hillside farms , stone walls , and traditional opposition to Paris . As nervous security guards patrolled overhead in helicopters , De Gaulle climbed off the train at Villefranche-de-Rouergue , lumbered straight into the town square , pumping hands and patting babies . <P> All did not go as smoothly as De Gaulle had hoped . In Villefranche-de-Rouergue , the mayor demanded " social justice and democratic liberty . " Throughout the department of Aveyron , teachers and veterans boycotted his appearances . But in general , despite a boycott ordered by farm and labor unions , De Gaulle got a rousing welcome . As his convoy of black Citrons wound through patches of woodlands tinged with autumn , past slate-roofed farmhouses , farmers and their families came to the edges of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossroads , schoolchildren fluttered paper flags . Once again , De Gaulle showed that despite sporadic signs of discontent , his hold on the French people remains largely intact . <P> Message Repeated . For De Gaulle , the critical area is not Metropolitan France but Algeria , where the ultranationalist Secret Army Organization of ex-General Raoul Salan seemed to be sneering louder every day at De Gaulle 's attempts to reach agreement with the F.L.N. From his hiding place near Algiers , Salan wrote a letter , which was published in Le Monde , denying that either he or the S.A.O . had been connected with the bomb attempt on De Gaulle 's life . Two days later , Salan 's men bombed the national television station 's transmitter near Algiers just before a scheduled program on De Gaulle 's tour . As TV screens went blank , the voice of Salan came on ( it was obviously broadcast on the TV station 's frequency from a nearby clandestine transmitter ) . " All Algerians should consider themselves mobilized , " said Salan . " We must remain vigilant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
