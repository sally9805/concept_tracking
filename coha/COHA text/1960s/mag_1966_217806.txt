In its efforts to fuel U.S. education with cash , the Great Society has taken a relaxed view of the First Amendment ban on official establishment of religion . Convinced that all Americans will benefit , Congress has included parochial-school students in a $1.3 billion federal program aiding U.S. public schools , and folded church-related campuses into a $1.6 billion plan for aiding higher education . The purpose is surely secular , but is it constitutional ? <P> Last week the Supreme Court ducked the question by refusing to review a key decision from the Maryland Court of Appeals that voided state aid to three church-related colleges and approved it for a fourth . Foes of federal aid to church schools were jubilant . They had sought the Maryland test because there seems to be no way to attack federal programs directly . According to a 1923 Supreme Court decision , federal taxpayers can not sue , charging misuse of federal taxes , unless they can prove substantial personal injury , which is virtually impossible . Although Congress could probably provide for judicial review by taxpayers ' suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation . <P> Sectarian Ambiance . By contrast , Maryland permits state-taxpayer suits - and starting in 1962 , the Maryland general assembly created a state college-aid program that parallels the federal setup . Four bills provided $2,500,000 for new facilities at four church-related colleges-Hood ( United Church of Christ ) , Western Maryland ( Methodist ) , Notre Dame and St. Joseph 's ( Roman Catholic ) . All of the bills were challenged by 13 Maryland taxpayers and the Horace Mann League , an association of 500 public-school educators . The state court 's decision , they hoped , would , by inference , hold the federal programs unconstitutional . <P> In striking down three of the grants last June , Maryland 's top court invoked the Supreme Court 's own test when it banned compulsory Bible reading in public schools in 1963 : " To withstand the strictures of the Establishment Clause there must be a secular legislative purpose and a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion . " It did not matter that the grants were specifically limited to nonreligious purposes-construction of dormitories and science buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so permeated by religion that a secular grant would automatically aid its sectarian ambiance . <P> Confused &; Vulnerable . How to measure such religiosity ? The court devised six criteria , ranging from the degree of church control and the number of compulsory religious courses to the " image of the college in the community . " However inviting to subjective judgment , the test clearly barred grants to the two Catholic colleges , one of which planned to put crucifixes in each new , tax-paid science classroom . Western Maryland 's Methodism was more elusive , but clear church control barred that grant too . Only Hood ( U.C.C. ) passed the test , because , among other open-minded policies , it welcomes teachers and students of all faiths-Jews , Catholics , Lutherans , Quakers and agnostics , to name a few .
