txt We were traveling about 55 , I suppose , when I saw this large black animal running across Route 61 ahead . First I thought it was a dog , but it was too big . We had passed three deer that foggy morning , pushing north above Duluth beside Lake Superior to the iron range . " Wake up , " I cried suddenly to Mary , who was dozing over " The Ten Colimandments . " ( The latter is a college te : : 1 ) . It had one of the oddest movements I ever saw . I think " gallumphing " is the proper word . It seemed incredible that anything so awkward could be so fast . It vanished in the underbrush . I would have paused . but the Rambler seemed to shy off . This is an unusual introduction perhaps to the subject of automation . But we were heading toward a monster industry set in the northern wilderness . Bears are up there with the men . Do n't Kick the Bears Can you call " wilderness " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rexall store ? It also has an occasional moose , snowfall to bury the White House , and an off-lake temperature one hates to think about . This industry in Silver Bay , Minn. , processes low-grade iron ore ( called taconite ) from the mines at Babbitt , and sends them down by 750-foot ore boats to the fiery furnaces of Cleveland , which turn them into car bodies that you wash on Saturday morning . William Bryant , president of the Reserve Mining Company  --  owned half by Republic Steel and half by Armco  --  explained it to Mary and me a little later . But a final word on bears . I asked the receptionist about the bear situation around Silver Bay . She said defensively that the bears were n't the ? trouble ; there had been only one recent incident . That was n't the bear 's fault , she said . " Go on " we urged . " It was a child , " she said . " She kicked it . " Mary and I have returned to this incident several times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kick bears seems a long way removed from , let us say , " Little Women . " Marvelous Process Mr. Bryant explained the plant . It all began , he said , when the Mesabi high-grade iron ore gave out . Americans had been talking about " inexhaustible " resources . They began exhausting them . We are - doing this everywhere now to minerals , our streams , and our very air . There was low-grade iron ore around taconite , Mr. Bryant said , but it was hard , impervious , and nobody knew how to use it . It is so sharp it would cut glass . What happened was that steel companies invested some third of a billion dollars around 1952 , and by creating a very marvel of modern processes ( outlined by " the father of taconite , " E. W. Davis ) they have produced the wilderness wonder that we visited . It yields 9 million tons a year . // A Saga of Bears And Iron Ore // Mr. Bryant sees a symbol in it . " We have got to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't see the taconite mined at Babbitt , 50 miles north . But eight 120-car trains come down from there a day , with rocks that range up to the size of kitchen tables . By the time Silver Bay is through with it it has been reduced to the fineness of the powder a woman uses on her nose . It has been brought up to a 63 percent iron . content , and just as a final touch it has been mixed with a clay binder called betonite and turned into nice little black pellets the size of cherry pits . Tom Richards of the Reserve Mining Company showed us around . A train of ore cars had come in . Two were standing over a great pit . Suddenly they turned over , dumping their raw taconite with a horrible roar into the abyss below . The cars were not uncoupled . When empty they came back to place and the whole train moved forward the length of another two cars . No human in sight . Mr. Richards explained that the company 's 33,000 employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ore drops into endless rubber conveyor belts . It is rolled , ground , magnetized , floated , and burned in the huge buildings . People seem as rare as bears on Highway 61 . Lovely Gray Mud We got so we began pointing out humans excitedly when we saw them . One was sweeping up . He did it , of course , in an automated lorry . I forgot to say that Mr. Bryant pressed a button and his door opened automatically . At one stage the slurry comes out as lovely gray mud just right for mud pies . Then it goes to the furnace for drying and pelletenizing , if there is such a word . A great wall filled with lights , dials , and thermometers tells how everything is going , and somewhere invisible human beings are watching it . The waste silicate ( sand ) goes off into Lake Superior where it is- guaranteed not to hurt fish . The factory safety record is one of the best in the world . And winds may howl and snow moan and bears hibernate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 12 months a year . In winter a mountain of ore piles up at dockside till navigation opens in April , and the huge boats load up ? automatically , of course . " Quick , " I said to Mary as we left , " look at the speedometer . I want to see how long this building is . " We started somewhere near the center , and it was about two-tenths of a mile long to where the birch and hemlock and fir trees began . Mr. Strout is en route to San Francisco for the Republican convention . This is the sixth in a series .
