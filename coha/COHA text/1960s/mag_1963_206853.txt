In December 1960. the U.S. first proposed to help NATO develop its own nuclear strike force . But Europe made no attempt to devise a plan . Last week , as they studied the Nassau accord between President Kennedy and Prime Minister Macmillan . Europeans saw emerging the first outlines of the nuclear NATO that the U.S. wants and will support . <P> It all sprang from the Anglo-U.S. crisis over cancellation of the bug-ridden Skybolt missile , and the U.S. offer to supply Britain and France with the proved Polaris ( TIME , Dec. 28 ) . The one Allied leader who unreservedly welcomed the Polaris offer was Harold Macmillan , who by thus keeping a separate nuclear deterrent for Britain had saved his own neck . <P> Back from Nassau , the Prime Minister beamed that Britain now had a weapon that " will last a generation . The terms are very good . " Many other Britons were not so sure . Though the government will shoulder none of the $800 million development cost of Polaris , it has already poured $28 million into Skybolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleet of missile-packing submarines . At best , the British will not be able to design , build and prove its nuclear fleet before 1970 , three years after Britain 's bomber force has presumably become obsolete . <P> Then what ? Tory backbenchers are loudly skeptical of what they call " the small type " in the Nassau pact , which stipulates that Britain 's Polaris submarine fleet , except when " supreme national interests intervene , must be committed to a truly multilateral NATO force . Does that mean that Britain will eventually have no strike force of its own ? Who will decide when or whether national interests justify withdrawal of submarines from NATO , particularly if those national interests conflict with U.S. policy ? The biggest question of all is whether France 's inclusion in the offer was a deliberate ploy by Jack Kennedy to end or at least downgrade Britain 's prized " special relationship " with the U.S. The cartoonists went even farther . They not only showed Supermac jumping to Superjack 's commands , but De Gaulle and Adenauer as well . <P> Unswerving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. in developing their force de frappe , were quick to crow that Britain 's ties with the U.S. had brought it nothing but humiliation . By contrast , bragged French officials , the Skybolt fiasco only vindicated France 's decision to develop its own bombs and delivery systems . Thus , though Charles de Gaulle promised to " reflect " on the Polaris offer , there was little likelihood that he would accept any offer that would subject a French force to Allied control . <P> It is De Gaulle 's unswerving conviction that if the Russians were actually to invade Western Europe , no nation that was not directly attacked-meaning the U.S.-would invite nuclear devastation by helping its allies . Thus , unlike Britain 's bomber force , which all along has been pledged to " the Western strategic deterrent , " France 's force de frappe will be responsible only for France 's defense .
