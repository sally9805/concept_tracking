" When there is chaos in China , " says an old Chinese proverb , " it strikes Szechwan first ; when there is peace , it comes to Szechwan first . " Last week chaos ruled in the southwestern prov ince of Szechwan . Peking wall posters reported that an extraordinary - and almost unbelievable - total of 10,000 persons had been killed or wounded in four weeks of fighting involving ma chine guns , hand grenades and poisoned drinking water . Among the casualties were 200 Maoists drowned in the Yangzte River on the way to a rally , the victims of Red Guards who had defected from Mao 's Cultural Revolution and rammed and sunk the Maoists in flotilla-to-flotilla combat . <P> The fighting in Szechwan was only the most prominent of Mao 's troubles last week , as spelled out in the big-character graffiti of wall posters . China-watchers did not believe all the vivid writing on the walls , but even at a discount the poster accounts added up to widespread turmoil . Some 35,000 autoworkers in Manchuria were said to have wrecked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posters described clashes in Peking and Shanghai , claimed that fighting took place in Shantung in east China , in northwestern Sinkiang , the site of China 's nuclear installations , in Inner Mongolia and in Honan , the largest wheat-growing province . Not surprisingly , the People 's Daily last week warned that " anarchism " suddenly threatened to undo all the gains of the Cultural Revolution . <P> <P> Barking at the Sun . In Szechwan , there were no gains to lose . Large , populous ( 80 million ) and strongly separatist , Szechwan represents a challenge to Mao 's central authority and to the validity of the Cultural Revolution . Its political and military boss since 1952 has been tough Politburo Member Li Ching-chuan , 59 , who earlier tacitly aided the anti-Maoists and was linked with Red Army Marshal Ho Lung , a onetime warlord and bandit , in a purported plot to depose Mao last February . <P> Li 's bastion is formidable . Isolated by a bordering ring of mountains and agriculturally self-sufficient , Szechwan has a long tradition of rebellion against central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese rulers in trouble , from the Emperor Ming of the 8th century to Chiang Kai-shek in the 1930s . So independent are the Szechwanese , that , as one Chinese proverb has it , " in Szechwan the dogs even bark at the sun . " <P> The Litmus . Red Guard wall posters demanded the ousting of Li , but he refused to budge . Up went posters demanding " Liberate the Southwest ! " , and last month Red Guards from Peking dutifully streamed into the Szechwan capital of Chengtu to spread the Maoist gospel and rally the peasants against Li . The peasants were not impressed , and in fact attacked the Red Guards , producing rioting and bloodshed . So serious is the trouble , and so vital is Szechwan as a litmus of the Maoist aspirations , reported Radio Moscow , that last week Mao dispatched his No. 2 man , Defense Minister Lin Piao , to the troubled province . It did not say whether he was to act as executioner or mediator .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
