Wilson , then dean of criminology at the University of California , took command of the Chicago police department after disclosures that some policemen were join . ing in crime instead of fivht ing it . In these months , Supt. Wilson has made his authority and his concepts of proper police procedure telt in every unit of the force . Some Witch Others New men have moved to top positions .

Important questions can be asked at this stage . What does the public think of the department now , after the months of sweeping and still continuing change ? Are policemen generally more honest ? What do policemen , themselves , think of the department 's new look ? Notice Big Change In search of answers to such questions , this reporter talked with taxicab drivers , truck drivers , men whu write burglary insurance and investigate burglary insurance losses , business leaders , and policemen . The taxicab and truck drivers , traditional targets for any " hungry " police officer seeking to pick up a few dollars by not giving a traffic ticket , generally stated they had noticed a big change  --  for the better .

" I remember , some years ago , driving to work before dawn and being stopped by police who told me I 'd been speeding . I Had n't , but they said they 'd have to take me in . I told them to go ahead , but instead they asked me how much money I had . " I told them I had exactly one buck for lunch . They said : ' Okay , we 'll settle for that ? we have to eat , too ! ' And , by golly , they took it , too . " About a dozen burglary insurance underwriter= and loss adjusters were interviewed .

None of the insurance m e n wanted to be named , but here are some of their comments : " Today , as far as the surface function of the police department is concerned , there seems to be a tremendous change for the better , " one said . " But , in the actual combatting of crime , particularly of burglars , there is not much change that I can see . " Supt. Wilson is supposed to be a great man when it co m es to organization and paper work . But whether h i s abilities are going to pay off whenitcomestofighting crime , I do n't know . " Good as Ever " I think there is less graft in the police department these days , but from the standpoint of a skilled , professional burglar I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ever was , " said another . " In my opinion , I do n't think the burglary situation is getting any better , " said a third expert . " Wilson may be doing a better job generally in running the department t ha n his predecessor , but we 're still having the same number of burglary claims . " Warmer words for the police force came from Albert J. Krueger , vice president of the Milk Wagon Drivers union in Chicago . " Apparently police are doing a better job of patroling because in the last six months things have been very quiet , as far as robberies of our members are concerned , " he said . " In the past , as many as half a dozen a week used to be held up . I think the department is a lot better than it was .

Coulter , the association 's chief executive officer . James E. Rutherford , president of the association and retired vice president of t h e Prudential Insurance company , said he is convinced Supt. Wil ' son 's aim is " to make the Chi ' cago police force the finest one in the nation  --  and he has the necessary ability , knowledge , and experience to do it . " All of the policemen asked for opinions about the depart , ment 's new look were told that their names would not be used . A majority said they liked what was happening . Others charged the reorganization of the detective division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all detectives now working out of six strategically placed area headquarters in the city  --  was a " mistake . " Still ther policemen complained about the special units which now " watch the force " ? generally , they seem to feel that such activity is n't quite cricket .
