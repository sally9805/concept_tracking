August Poetess Dame Edith Sitwell , <P> 75 , boasts a lineage that goes back to England 's Plantagenet kings ( 1154-1485 ) and a memory that goes back almost as far . Last week , when she opened an invitation from one Villiers David to a showing of his watercolors , the name struck a familiar chord . In a twinkling , Dame Edith recalled that 28 long years ago , the obscure artist wrote an obscure poem called " A Satiric Preface to a Film " : <P> <P> Let bogus poets first apologise , <P> Control their vanity , confess their lies . . . <P> <P> Has any man who 's ever read a line <P> Discovered meaning yet in Gertrude Stein ? <P> <P> At least the Sitwells trumpet their intent : <P> <P> Not verse that 's just , but just Advertisement . . . <P> <P> For this ancient act of lese majesty , Dame Edith took pen in blue-veined hand , rattled her Tibetan bracelets and administered a crushing snub to Villiers David . Wrote she : " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Osbert and Mr. Sacheverell Sitwell her younger brother made in verse some years ago , you should have the impudence to invite me to waste my time at your show . " <P> <P> A big man with big plans donned top hat and swallow-tailed coat and , surrounded by an escort of sword-bearing Indian guards , called at the Presidential Palace in New Delhi . U.S. Ambassador to India John Kenneth Galbraith , a shade under 7 ft. tall in his topper ( 6 ft. 8 in. without it ) , could hardly have picked a more propitious moment to meet with Indian officials : the U.S. was about to offer $1 billion for basic development projects over the next two years if the other members of the " Aid to India Club , " Britain , Canada , West Germany and Japan , matched the contribution . If the scheme materializes , Galbraith may be able to tackle a pet embassy project , building a nuclear power plant and a giant steel mill that would dwarf a similar , propaganda-packed Soviet showpiece . <P> <P> The Lenin Peace Prizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unlikely apostles of tranquillity last week : Cuba 's Premier Fidel Castro and Guinea 's President Skou Tour . To Tour the prize seemed something of a lefthanded compliment . " We are not Communists , " he proclaimed , but he accepted anyway . Castro , not a bit abashed , announced that he might rush right off to Moscow to pick up his 25,000 rubles ( $27,750 ) , added with uncharacteristic modesty that he thought of the prize " not as a personal award , but as an unmatched and great honor for our people . " <P> <P> Oh , it 's perfectly clear <P> That there 's change when the critics forgather . <P> Last year was a Hawthorne year . <P> Coming up-Willa Gather ?
