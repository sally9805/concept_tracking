In several stories such illumination comes in a flash , in others it filters through the drawn blinds of repressed consciousness or is only on the verge of quickening atter the last word has been read In " First Heat " ( like many of Taylor 's titles a literal and metaphorical pun ) a politician lies nude and sweating in a stuffy hotel room , rationalizing his failure to support a bill after he had promised to , and seeing in a shattering moment " beyond mere nakedness of body and spirit " the " ultimate nakedness " of lost integrity and self-respect . " Dean of Men , " a monologue spoken by a college president to his rebel son , reveals by almost imperceptible steps and shifts the ancestral flaw of character that has turned the narrator , his father , and his grandfather into objects of be-trab'al " Reservations " starts off with the initially comic predicament of a Nashville debutante and her parvenu bridegroom on their wedding night in a seedy hotel , as the story develops the couple passes through abuse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Silently they were toasting their own bliss and happiness , confident that it would never again be shadowed by the irrelevances of the different circumstances ot their upbringings or by the possibly impure and selfish motives that had helped to bring them together " This note of betrayal , echoing elsewhere in the collection , is muted when Taylor goes expressly after other things . " At the Drugstore , " " Their Losses , " and " Miss Leonora When Last Seen " are all superficially concerned with how the past has betravtd the present But the " regret for lost opportunities , " the nostalgia for " banishing towns " and the " atmosphere ot a prosperous civilized existence , " the painful dwelling on " the old days , the old days " are barriers to awareness and understanding Taylor shows charity , warmth , patience for those who fall back on what can no longer be real in order to avoid confronting what is Yet such people can onl survive as anachronisms , as victims of their own ambiguity Escape into the past is crippling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one must engage the present . " escape into reality " ? even if , as in " At the Drugstore , " it leads a man visiting his home town after many years into intimations of ram-Wax : leads the middle-aged professor of ' le Sun Perdu " into acknowledging " that he was no longer going to be this or that He was- , or leads " an old bachelor brother " in " Heads of Houses " into realizing he " was without any life of his own . " That last phrase could sei ye as an epigraph to what for me is Taylor 's best story In " A Wife of Nashville " betrayal again leads to understanding , but Helen Ruth awakens not only to herself but to a sense of the other Her servants ( who come in succession , stay on for varying periods of time , yet always find some pretext for leaving ) are fluid symbols for the continuing deception she practices upon herself Their passion to make a life of their own contrasts with Helen Ruth 's dependency on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of involvement , loneliness Their crude , transparent , inexpert lies are counterparts to her one Happenings , of all art forms , are dependent on a photographic record , it the fugitive actions are not to be confined to the participants ' memories Claes Oldenburg 's season of Happenings , 1961-62 , the last of the classic first wave , was filmed by Raymond Saroff and will be screened bb the Museum ot Modern Art ( date not set ) during the run ot Oldenhurg 's current exhibition The filmic record is essential to supplement Oldenburg 's scenai los I published by the Something Else Press ) Peter Moore has photographed with remarkable patience almost everything in the was ol Happening , s , events and environments through the sixties , as a result , his archives are crucial to a stud ) ot the occasional aspects of recent American art A shift in the forms of visual art , toward the ephemeral and the diffuse , has treated a great and dreadful lie  --  that of her hap-piness " A Wife of Nashville " is about the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if slowly , to a consciousness gradually opening through the years The story shows how the gulf between people can be bridged through learning " that everything that happened in life only demonstrated in some way the lonesomeness that people felt " , it shows that invented strengths are as precarious and delicate as innate weaknesses . Happiness may be an illusion , betrayal may be a constant reality . Yet Taylor 's stories are finally neither bleak nor pessimistic . Understanding brings his characters to illumination and then first real hope . storage problem Paintings and sculptures persist as objects , but an art of performance and problematic thresholds leaves no original body and can be preserved onb , in record form .
