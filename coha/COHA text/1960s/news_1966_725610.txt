Doctors especially are concerned that when some of these patients learn that they have to pay the first $40 of the hospital bill and the first S50 of the doctors ' charges out of their own pockets , they may become angry . Patient Faces Bills In addition , the patient will I have to pay 20 per cent of the total doctor 's bill , minus the $50 deductible , as well as the costs of a number of other health items not covered by medicare . One of the biggest surprises in store for many persons 65 years old or older will be the discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of his bill before they can collect a penny from the government . The patient will then have to send the doctor 's receipted bill to Blue Shield , the government 's intermediary in Cook county , to be reimbursed for 80 per cent of the cost minus the $50 deductible .

If his doctor charges $1,000 , the patient pays $50 deductible and 20 per cent of the remainder or a total of $240 . So , for a patient with a total expense of $2,500 , medicare will pay for all but $280 , as long as the services rendered come under the law 's provisions . Carry 60 Pct. of Load According to some authorities . medicare will pay not more than 60 per cent of the average bill .
