Traditionally , politicians are enthusiastic joiners . But in this day of the New Frontier , it has become more fashionable to be an unjoiner-and New York 's Democratic Mayor Robert Wagner is nothing if not fashionable . Last fortnight he turned in his resignation from the New York Athletic Club on the ground that it bars Negroes and Jews . Last week he announced that he might unjoin the New York Lodge No. 1 of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks , an organization which he once headed , as Exalted Ruler , because the Elks constitution limits membership to " white male citizens of the U.S. " But Bob Wagner still has a long way to go . Of 31 other organizations to which he belongs , two social clubs , the Lotus and Tough Clubs , have no Negro members ; neither do the two Long Island country clubs where he is a member , the Southward Ho and Harbor Hills . <P> For that matter , every organization that Wagner belongs to discriminates in its own way . The Boy Scouts of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Young Democrats no Republicans , the County Corkmen 's Association no Orangemen . <P> And all the others , by their very nature , have limited memberships : the National Conference of Christians and Jews , Veterans of Foreign Wars , American Legion , Catholic War Veterans of the U.S.A. , Automobile Club of America , Yale Club , Harvard Business School Club , Guild of Catholic Lawyers , Grand Street Boys Club , First Avenue Boys , Friendly Sons of St. Patrick , Ancient Order of Hibernians in America , National Democratic Club , New York Society for the City of New York , U.S. Air Reserve , Order of Ahepa , Emerald Society of the Fire Dept , Greenwich Village Lions Club , Police Athletic League , Cherokee Club , Irish Institute , Affiliated Young Democrats , New York County Lawyers Association , Association of the Bar of the City of New York , New York State Bar Association and the Manhattan Club .
