Even seated at his littered desk in Canberra 's Parliament House , he always seemed bigger than life . His great black eyebrows clumped out angrily , like saltbush in the Great Sandy Desert , and his vast stomach bulged defiance against his double-breasted suit . He was quarrelsome , autocratic , always demanding , and the greatest orator his country has yet produced . He founded the Liberal Party that swept him to power , forged the government coalition that kept him there for 16 years . Prime Minister Sir Robert Gordon Menzies not only governed Australia . He overpowered it . <P> When he resigned last week at 71 , he did it in true Menzies style . Playing out his drama with the skill of an actor , Sir Robert resigned not once but four times-to Parliament , his party , the Governor General , and finally to the nation on television . " I have given careful thought to my future in the light of what seems best for the government and country , " he " said . " I can no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . My pace has slowed down . In short , I am tired . " <P> So , in a sense , were Australians , who long ago combined the Scotch pronunciation of his name ( " Mingis " ) with a comic-strip character called " Ming the Merciless , " dubbed his regime " The Ming Dynasty . " <P> Deadly Sting . Merciless he was . <P> When members of his coalition threatened to rebel , he yanked them into line by the sheer force of his personality and his ruthless tongue . So deadly was his sting in Parliament ( " The conducted tour of the Honorable Member 's mind would have been more instructive if it had not taken place in gathering darkness " ) that opposition backbenchers were once cautioned against needling him . To a parliamentary complaint that he had a superiority complex , Menzies could only agree . " Considering the company I keep in this place , " he snapped , " that is hardly surprising . " <P> He was always something of a snob . As Prime Minister , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , test matches at the fashionable Marylebone Cricket Club , and the Commonwealth Conference ( " I make a few statesmanlike remarks . The eminent gentlemen of the civil service , who have already written the ultimate communiqu , say , ' Yes , that was a good point ' " ) . <P> To the British Establishment , in fact , he is the perfect Australian : silvery-haired , conservatively tailored , reverential about traditions , plummy in accent , and , above all , delighting in pomp . Sir Robert literally clanks with honors . He is Knight of the Order of the Thistle , Privy Counsellor , Companion of Honour , Queen 's Counsel , and three months ago he became the first non-Englishman to be appointed Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports , an order that entitles him to fly a blue , yellow and red flag depicting Dover Castle and rates him a 19-gun salute in the five ports for which the order was named. *
