" Hoffa and the other defendants were tried here on a 53-page indictment returned by a Federal grand jury 13 months ago . The trial lasted 13 weeks , nine weeks of this taken up by testimony . The Government charged that Hoffa had abused his responsibility as union president and pension-fund trustee when he entered into a secret trust agreement that gave him , in addition to a purchase option , a major share of Sun Valley , Inc. , a Florida real-estate project near Cape Kennedy that was promoted as a retirement haven for teamster members . From this and other Hoffa relationships with the project , the Government charged , flowed a complicated series of transactions designed to " bail out " Hoffa when Sun Valley fell into financial difficulties in 1958 and was reorganized . Hoffa admitted he had a purchase option for 45 per cent of Sun Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released . But he denied that in 1955 he had signed a secret document making him one of three beneficiaries of an additional 45 per cent of the stock held in trust . ' Investigators for the Federal ( Bureau of Investigation and the Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or ' Management Field turned up a $400,000 deposit placed in the Florida National Bank at Orlando by Hoffa 's hometown local , 299 . That bank , in turn , loaned $400,000 to Sun Valley . When the bank got a judgment in 1958 against the failing project it also refused to release the deposit of Local 299 . Hoffa was questioned about it by the chief counsel of the Select Committee  --  the McClel lan committee . Hoffa insisted before the committee , as ' he did at the trial here , that his only . interest had been the purchase option . The Government position was that the deposit of Local 299 deposit had been security for the loan to Sun Valley  --  inl effect , that Hoffa had used union money for a possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trust agreement bore the signature of " IR .

Hoffa , who received the verdict in fraud trial at the Federal Court , in Chicago . fund loan if he would take over Sun Valley . The builder refused . The Government also produced evidence in an effort to show that Dranow had found persons wanting to borrow from the pension fund . In return , the Government witnesses said , Dranow would charge high finders ' fees and divert some of the fee money to Sun Valley creditors .

However , the Government charged , the defendants continued to obtain pension loans on misleading applications for real-estate projects . Hof fa insisted that he was but one of 16 employer-employe trustees of the $280 million pension fund , known formally as the Central States , Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund , with headquarters in Chicago . The fund covers more than 200,000 teamsters in 20 states . Defense lawyer. ; argued that the 14 loans In question hadl never resulted in any loss toll the fund . A chief Government witness , wAs Vaughn B. Connelly , whoa said he had paid the defendants Dranow and Kovens about $400.000 in 1959 for arranging pension - fund loans totaling $4.3 million for improvements on his hotel in Miami . He said that he had lost the hotel , valued at $10 million , when the pension fund foreclosed in 1960 . Convicted Last March Hoffa was convicted , with three others , last March in a Chattanooga Federal court of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoffa trial in 1962 . He received 4n eight-year sentence , but the four men are free on bond pendling their appeal . The case here is the latest in a series for Hoffa going back to the Depression years , when he ( was first arrested during picket ' line disturbances , But including the Chattanooga case , he had been convicted only four times . In 1937 , he was fined $10 for assault and battery . Three years later , he pleaded nolo contendere ? no contest ? on a charge of monopoly-conspiracy and was fined $500 . In 1947 , he was charged with attempted extortion under Michigan law in connection with labor-organizing , but the charge was eventually reduced to a misdemeanor , and he was fined $500 and put on probation for two years . The current trial is the latest of many major Federal criminal proceedings against him . The first was the monopoly-conspiracy charge in 1940 .

The first trial of this indictment resulted in a hung jury . In a second trial , in 1958 , all were acquitted . In 1960 , the teamster president and Robert E. McCarthy Jr. , a Detroit banking executive , were indicted for mail fraud . They were charged with misusing for personal profit $500. - 000 in union funds for Sun Valley . The indictment was dismissed in 1961 , because of a defect in the selection of a grand jury . In 1962 , Hoffa was arrested and charged with assaulting Samuel Baron , a field director of the union 's warehouse division . But the Government . decided not to prosecute .
