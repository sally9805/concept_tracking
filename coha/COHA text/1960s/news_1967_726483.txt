txt Premier Fidel Castro told a roaring and colorful crowd of almost half a million Cubans today that they must help all the oppressed peoples of the world , including the American Negroes , but warned them that they must not count on outside , help in defending their own island from " the North American imperialist . " In his first major speech since Premier Aleksei N. Kosygin of the Soviet Union visited here several weeks ago , the Cuban leader surprised even many of his sympathizers from abroad by asking his people to take on more foreign responsibilities while counting on less foreign help . Premier Castro spoke on the column missing ceived . Her friends were too far away to provide effective aid , he said , and Cubans must therefore be prepared to act alone if necessary . The Premier said guerrilla warfare , which had been proved in the overthrow of the Batista Government and in the war in Vietnam , was the answer to the Cuban problem . He said Cuba could prevail , even if she were invaded , by being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago .

When Premier Kosygin left Counsel Is Rejected Against this background , Premier Castro 's speech was really a rejection of this reported counsel . He did not pretend that he had the support of the Soviet Union in the event of a military confrontation with the United States . Yet he couched his remarks about the United States in the most provocative terms . He linked the war in Vietnam to the guerrilla war in Latin America and linked them both to the American Negroes ' struggle in the cities of the United States . It was this invitation to the Cuban people to fight more battles abroad without any assurance of aid that surprised observers here more than almost anything else . A crowd gathered at the plaza hours before Premier Castro arrived . The people ? students who had excelled in school , farmers who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , battered buses and trucks from all over the island . There was also an extraordinary collection of foreign visitors , most of whom were brought here by the Cuban Government . Mr. Carmichael came from Prague , Czechoslovakia ; a protest singer was flown from Cease-fire ' Condemned If Cuba were attacked , the Premier said , she would arm all the people and define as a " traitor " any Cuban who ever used the word " cease-fire , " which , he added , should be abolished from the language of the Cuban people . The Premier said Cuba would be faithful to all the " progressive forces of the world , " was watching the " black fighters " of the United States and would never let them down . He said the Organization of the American States , which was presuming to sit in judgment on Cuba , supported " reaction , oligarchy and bandits . " He added : Australia , and a dance team came from Italy . There was also a strange collection of journalists , some of them known to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the city rooms of American newspapers . Temperature Almost 100 The temperature was almost 100 degrees . The Plaza of the Revolution , twice the size of a football field , was lined with vast billboards celebrating the heroes of the Cuban revolution and streaming with vast red , white and blue banners . On the high stand at the end of the plaza sat the representatives of North Vietnam and the National Liberation Front , the political arm of the Vietcong , and members of the Cuban Cabinet . Below them were the press and several hundred Cuban youths selected for their good grades and " good morals . " The Cuban people , by the hundreds of thousands , stood in the crush and the heat . A temporary hospital was set up on the edge of the plaza to deal with many cases of heat prostration . During the long wait for Mr. Castro , the crowd was entertained by a radio account of a baseball game in Canada between Cuban and Mexican teams . At 5 P.M. the Premier arrived . His beard is longer now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immensely powerful . Most of his speech did not deal with questions of the cold war or the Negroies in the United States or the guerrillas in Latin America . He dealt primarily with the internal problems of the Cuban revolution , and on these he was a master of statistics . The Premier did not try to conceal the defects in his administration . He was particularly eloquent on the differences between life in major Cuban cities and life in the countryside , where , he observed , many of the sugar workers were living in the same huts they had occupied eight years ago , when he took office . He said the people in the countryside had been shortchanged and people in the cities were being exploited because the government had not been able to provide enough and there were shortages .
