As Chairman Wilbur Mills impatiently twirled his cigarette holder and fired off barbed questions , seven leading economists trooped before the House Ways and Means Committee last week to support the Administration 's call for a 10% surtax on personal and corporate incomes . Well over 300 academic economists mobilized by Walter W. Heller , former chairman of the President 's Council of Economic Advisers , added their written endorsement . Then came businessmen declaring themselves fit to be tithed and a covey of Administration officials pleading for higher taxes . <P> They differed on details but demonstrated a remarkable consensus : prompt imposition of a surtax is vital to curb inflation in an overheating economy , reduce a Government deficit that may hit $29 billion this fiscal year and head off a repetition of the credit squeeze that rocked business in 1966 . <P> Chaos &; Catastrophe . " The economy is moving on a course of rapid expansion , " said William McChesney Martin , chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and the man who most of all persuaded the President to seek the surtax . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction and industrial production , an increase in inventories and order backlogs and a drop in unemployment , Martin found " clear and compelling evidence " of inflation . " An environment of rampant inflation , " warned former Treasury Under Secretary Robert V. Roosa , " will afford little opportunity for the considered development of any national policy , domestic or foreign . " Roosa forecast economic dislocation " bordering on chaos " unless action was taken soon . <P> <P> " The combination of Government v. private borrowing , " cautioned Walter B. Wriston , president of First National City Bank of New York , " already has caused interest rates for everyone to rise . It will get worse , much worse , in the absence of the tax surcharge . " And Sidney J. Weinberg , a senior partner of Goldman , Sachs &; Co. , prophesied " catastrophic developments in capital and credit markets " without the tax . <P> <P> Slow Motion . But as Chairman Mills prepared to lead his committee into executive sessions behind locked doors , the White House was ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year . " I think the boys are just going to stand around the campfire for a couple of weeks , " said Republican Representative Herman T. Schneebeli , a member of Mills 's committee . " It 's going to be a study in slow motion . " Ranged against the experts are Congressmen who must face the voters next year ; even as Congress voted a record $70 billion appropriation for defense , they were showing no inclination to vote the taxes to pay for it . <P> Returning from the Labor Day recess , legislators reported an overwhelming feeling against the tax among their constituents ; a clear majority of 240 House members is already on record against it . Even many liberals who are leary of thwarting the President are concealing their opposition by first pressing for reforms to plug tax loopholes . Laments a Democratic House leader : <P> " A tax bill would be defeated by 100 votes if we brought it up today . "                   @ @
