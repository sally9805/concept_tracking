txt  | subject , that places the Great Charter in its immediate historical background and also explicates in detail the significance of each clause in the document . W. S. McKechnic 's Magna Carta , although published a halfcentury ago , and too strongly under the debunking attitude of the day , is still the only detailed commentary . J. C. Holt , the author of a valuable study of the northern barons who led the rebellion against the king , has recently published a general study of Magna Carta . By taking into account modern scholarship , particularly the work of the American scholars Sidney Painter and S. K. Mitchell , Ilolt 's study is much superior to McKechnic 's as regards the historical context of Magna Carta ? the social structure of early thirteenth-century England and the working of royal administration . But McKechnie 's clause-by-clause explication of the text of the Charter still has not been superseded . Anyone who wishes to understand the constitutional and legal issues involved in the king 's confrontation with the barons in 1215 should read J. E. A. Jolliffe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its presentation and difficult for the lay reader . Perhaps the most fruitful and realistic way to treat Magna Carta is to analyze it first as a tax document . It is fairly clear that John 's violations of law would not have led to insurrection if he had not been ignominiously defeated in battle , and if he had not tried to enforce certain financial policies which fell uncomfortably on all landowners . Certain families who had been specially persecuted by arbitrary violations of due process also quickened baronial discontent . Of 63 clauses , at least 24 deal with taxation ? a looser reading of the text ( the total of 24 is based on a strict interpretation ) could easily expand this to 40 . On one level , Magna Carta is a document concerned with royal financial policy and is a profound reaction to specific tax policies of John . Medieval taxation is only slightly less boring than modern taxation ( it does , however , have the charm of distance ) , but we will have to consider it . Since we have all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about medieval English taxation with a high degree of accuracy . Inflation and the steadily rising costs of military technology made sure that John 's government never had enough money . Heavy-plate armor , bigger horses , thicker walls ? all these made war dearer than it had been . Government itself cost more ; there were more and more salaried administrators whose wages seem lavish to us , accustomed to the idea that civil servants arc ordained to live on subsistence wages . ( Perhaps this explains why Angevin governments were staffed with the most talented men avail-  | able . ) John was supposed to rely on the ordinary sources of royal income to meet expenses . This included the income from the royal demesne , the law courts ( where the expansion of the royal writ system was a boon ) and feudal taxes . John 's government managed the royal domain very well , and his judges conscientiously levied all the fines they could think of , no matter how irrelevant . Fines were imposed , for instance , for failure to present Englishry , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a dead Frenchman . No matter how efficiently run , however , there were absolute limits to what the demesne and the courts would yield . As far as the feudal taxes were concerned , the government had a good deal of latitude ? there was much scope for maneuvering . And John 's government took all the leeway it could ; it consistently overstepped the bounds of personal and social propriety . Relief could be assessed in a punitive way ? often it was three , four and even five times the annual income of the particular fief . Considering the death rate , a baronial family could expect to pay a relief every five to ten years . Thus excessively high relief was a neat way to keep a baronial family bankrupt and this was going beyond the limits ? it was precisely the kind of violation of the " law of the land " that the barons had in mind when they drafted clause 39 . John 's insanity gave Angevin toughness a peculiar color . John was really mean , and he delighted in his viciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were his wards to the highest bidder and he was ecstatic when he could get ? and he did once get ? 2o,000 pounds for an heiress . It specially amused John to marry his rich wards to obscure foreigners , to French mercenaries . This " disparaging " of the fair daughters of the English aristocracy was very offensive to the nobility , and the several provisions about relief and wardship in Magna Carta reflect their distaste . ' Wardship appears four different times . Clause 2 , which deals with punitive relief , establishes relief at ioo pounds per baron . This clause was accepted in the 1225 reissue , and thereafter relief was fixed at this nominal sum . The enforcement of this rigid settlement was a heavy blow to the exchequer officials , who had counted on relief as a growth-potential tax . Though relief was eliminated , the English crown continued to be the guardian of aristocratic heirs and to marry off widows . It is interesting that the crown accepted limitations on the more general and dependable tax of relief , but stubbornly refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonanza , was too much of an intermittent matter to be much help to royal finances . ( Wardship  | continued to be a source of royal income until 1660 , when it was abolished by act of Parliament . ) Thus Magna Carta effectively ended the excessive exploitation of the regular sources of crown income ? sources which yielded John approximately 27,000 pounds per year . John 's government consequently had to turn to the extraordinary , irregular sources of royal revenue and attempt to increase taxation in this direction . ' These efforts were bound to be controversial and to foment political discontent . Scutage was the most obvious of these extraordinary sources of crown revenue that could possibly be augmented . Henry II 's government had begun to think of scutage not as an integral part of the military system , but rather as a prime source of revenue . They also saw that the king 's tenants had more tenants than they were paying for . Scutage was still based on the " old enfeoffment " of the Norman period . But in the twelfth century new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knights settled , land had been cleared , and it supported more men . The government was not getting any of this additional income ; a vassal who had owed the service of 25 knights a halfcentury ago might now have 45 knights . With scutage at 2 marks per knight , the government ? aside from what inflation was doing to the value of the mark ? was losing 40 marks absolutely . This was exactly the kind of problem Henry II 's administrators thought they knew how to solve . In 1166 they undertook a comprehensive investigation of knight 's fees ; they asked for returns from every baron stating how many knights he had , what was the old enfeoffment , what was the new one . The barons stiffly refused to pay any new scutage , and Henry II 's government never did settle the issue . It was doubtful in law if the barons owed scutage on their new knights , and they could not be made to pay . They were willing to pay a lump fine , but would not acknowledge the principle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ways to squeeze it out of the recalcitrant magnates . First he raised scutage from two to three marks , which , he said , was justified by inflation . And he took it more often ? eleven times in sixteen years , in the amount of 3,000 pounds per levy . This provoked bitter resistance . After eight or nine scutages the barons were furious . The most they could be expected to tolerate was scutage about every five years ? that seemed reasonable for a fighting king . But John would demand scutage , call out the army , and then fail to fight . Ile had various explanations ? the wind had  | changed , or the political situation was not quite ripe . Meanwhile , he was converting an incidental feudal revenue into an arbitrary annual tax . Clause 12 of Magna Carta , which states that " Scutage or aid shall be levied . . . only by the common counsel of our kingdom " is designed to cope with this problem . If the king has turned a feudal prerogative into a regular annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken with consent . To the royal officials , this new sanction was an invasion of the king 's feudal prerogative and they dodged the issue by reverting to Henry 's II 's practice of occasional composition . Although the 1225 reissue of Magna Carta rejected clause 12 , John 's government had been stopped from turning an old feudal levy into an annual tax . Tallage , another sore point , was traditionally the way of blackmailing the bourgeoisie . Occupying an ambiguous region somewhere between the liber homo and the serf , the bourgeoisie had no clear status in law . And on the principle that ? not being freemen ? they were subject to arbitrary taxation like any serf on the royal domain , the townsmen were ruthlessly exploited . Tallage was the royal euphemism for extortion ; the bourgeois euphemism for tallage was aid . " Aid " might seem to give the whole unpleasant business an aura of volition , but it deceived no one . The refusal of the crown to recognize their status as freemen kept the bourgeoisie anxious and frustrated . John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained an income of 2,500 to 5,000 pounds per levy . It was obvious that they were about to lose whatever insecure status they had ; their consolidation in law with the peasantry ? really an awful fate ? seemed imminent . This explains that peculiar phrase in clause 12 , which states that " aids " for the city of London shall be taken with consent . Tallage was one prerogative tax that Magna Carta did not arrest . Clause 12 was later rejected by the crown , but even in 1215 , as far as the bourgeoisie were concerned , it was obviated by clause 25 . Clause 25 , which allows the king to do what he wants on his own property , is the first statement of the principle later expressed as " the king shall live of his own . " Magna Carta allows the king to tax as he pleases on the royal demesne . The barons thought this was a very good idea , but it was disastrous for the burgesses who did in fact live on the royal demesne . Clause 12 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former was a sop to the burgesses , but the latter really gives the king the right to tax them as much as he wants . And he does . Tallage  | law . Another clever scheme of John 's hard-pressed government was carucage . This was a bright new name for the old Danegeld , and John tried to apply it once , when it yielded only 2,000 pounds . In the sense that carucage was levied on everyone 's land , it was a national tax , and everyone refused to pay . This was exactly the sort of thing that finally caused the barons to balk ? it was bad enough to sell widows and fair daughters , but for the king to tax their land was unacceptable . But he could still tax all their other property . Here 1207 was a great breakthrough , the turning point in the history of medieval taxation . In 1188 a crusading tax , the Saladin tithe , had been levied under the auspices of the church . Ten percent of all rents and movables was taken , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through an extensive use of local officials and juries of recognition in every village , provided a huge income . In 1207 the crown went back to this idea and , on its own authority , levied a thirteenth . The sanction was the principle of gracious aid ? the king could request freely granted aid in order to go to war . The magnates were summoned , as spokesmen of the community of the realm , to give consent for the whole country . Ostensibly they were being consulted in accordance with the Norman feudal principle , but what they consented to was , in effect , a national tax . As in 1188 , the method of assessment was the jury of recognition and the unit of taxation was , significantly , not the barony , but the vill . And it was the most lucrative of all John 's taxes , yielding 6o,000 pounds . This tax served as the precedent , in Henry III 's reign , for a new national tax which in turn became , in the reign of Edward I , parliamentary taxation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feudal taxation , it also forced the king to expand nonfeudal taxation . Left with a dwindling feudal income , the crown from this point on groped its way toward a national tax . The one area of taxation that was left untouched by Magna Carta was to become , under Henry III and Edward I in the thirteenth century and Parliament in the fourteenth , the most important source of royal income . Since it would be foolish to pretend that Magna Carta is merely a tax document , that is does not transcend the thirtenth-century context , and in order to evaluate it sensibly in its larger perspective , we might increased in the thirteenth century and did not vanish until , at the end of the century , towns were brought under parliamentary taxation . And even then the higher rate they pay still reflects the old , inferior status in  | pose two questions . What do we mean by constitutional government , and how does Magna Carta contribute to it ? Our answer to this first question will have to be arbitrary . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XIV , Hitler , W. E. Gladstone and John Milton . But , as it specially pertains to English history , there are three requisite elements of constitutional government : viable government , sense of the community , rule of law . The first requirement , which may sound fatuous , is government itself ? a central government that effectively carries out the functions of law , peace and security . In short , government must be able to protect the realm ; if it can not do this it is no government . According to this definition , there was no constitutional government in England before io66 . Anglo-Saxon government was really government of the absurd , it was government by random organization , there was nothing rationalized about it . From the time of William the Conqueror until the end of Henry II 's reign , viable government was established in England and , given the limitations forced upon it by problems of communications and baronial privilege , English government was very effective . The second criterion of constitutional government is the sense of the community . Government must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion . The king must realize that he is not absolute , he must see himself as a member of a corporate society , and the leaders of society must identify themselves as the community of the realm . In Henry II 's reign we begin to get this kind of identification . At first it is an unformed and tentative feeling , but later in the twelfth century people will actually begin to talk about it ; the new term " pleas of the crown " is an expression of it . The king begins to have an idea of office ; there is a distinction between king and crown , between the king in his public and personal aspect . In his public capacity the king belongs to the community to which he is responsible . And early in the thirteenth century , the sense of being the " community of the realm " is impressed upon the magnates ? they feel that they are more than a group of powerful , self-seeking individuals ; now they see themselves as leaders of a corporate society to which they , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the responsibility of government to law . Government must respect the law ; the machinery for changing it must not be an arbitrary procedure lodged exclusively in the king 's hands . If fluctuation of the king 's will can change law ; if ? like the emperor of the Justinian Code ? he is the living law , then he is responsi- ble to nothing but himself . In the tradition of English law , however , the king is responsible to a law over which he does not have ultimate authority . Though the law is not his , though he does not exert legislative sovereignty over it , he must maintain it , and must obtain the consent of the community in order to change it . In the great council of the Angevin monarchs the consent was more nominal than real . But there was , even here , service rendered to the principle that the king is not a living law , that he is somehow responsible to a will and a force outside himself . We can not say that twelfth-century men carefully defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any clarity how it was external to the king . Not until the seventeenth century will a clear definition be reached , and not until the eighteenth century will the idea be fully worked out in an institutional way . In the reign of John these three constitutional elements were present : effective central government , sense of community , and the idea that the king is responsible to law which is external to him and not entirely under his control . This last idea is embodied in Magna Carta ; it is the most important constitutional idea in the document , and it is postulated very clearly in two short and unequivocal clauses . Article 39 , the due process clause , is the basis of English constitutionalism . " No freeman shall be captured or imprisoned . . . except by the lawful judgement of his peers and by the law of the land . " The word to note here is " freeman . " Serfs , who constituted about 40 percent of the population , are not under the protection of the law . All others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the land ? whatever it might be . Lawful judgment of peers in 1215 means the jury of presentment in criminal pleas , the jury of recognition in civil suits ; for magnates it means trial at the king 's court . This article sets forth the idea that law is external to the king . Without this idea , clause 39 has no meaning ; we know this is what the magnates were groping for . If the king has absolute control of the operation of the law , this clause is nonsense . Under John the royal judges were manipulating the legal system . The law of the land had been established by government with the consent of the community , but then the legal system had been treated by the Angevin king as his own creature ; it had not been allowed to operate as something external to the king and his administration . Although the king and administrators operate the legal system , it is not theirs . This is a very hard concept to understand clearly and it will be very difficult to teach men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their hands . It will take five hundred years ,  | but at least the idea is here . We could tell subsequent English history as the story of the institutional working out of clause 39 of Magna Carta , of the attempt to fulfill the theory that the legal system is not the king 's , that the law of the land resides in the community . " To no one will we sell , to no one will we deny or delay right or justice . " Clause 40 postulates the same idea in these words ; the clause was not designed to cancel the income from writs , but to put an end to practices of suspending cases for money , bribing judges , and other similar offenses . It sounds bold and sure , but for four hundred years clause 40 represents little more than wishful thinking . ( The government of Elizabeth I was notorious for selling justice . ) Again , however , the principle ? without which reformers never get anywhere ? is here . There are some other clauses of legal significance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the assizes of Henry II , and perpetuates the system of royal courts . One amendment states that all assizes are to be held in the county of origin ? cases are not to be moved . Here again is the idea of the community of the shire and trial by peers . To move a case is somehow to rupture its necessary link with the community . Even when a case is merely taken into the next county , the members of the jury ? no longer on their home territory ? are more susceptible to threat and subornation . Here is the notion that the best protection of the rights of Englishmen is to be found in the community , that a man will find justice in his own shire . The other amendment provides that the assizes shall be held more often and catch up with the backlog of pending cases . The gentry , who benefited from the assizes , were eager to keep and reinforce Henry II 's legal changes . For cases against the great barons , the gentry needed the royal court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common pleas in Westminster . By and large , as long as the king upholds the law of the land , the gentry will be satisfied . Clause 34 abolishes prceci fie , the writ which arbitrarily deprived a freeman of his own court . The power of baronial courts was broken by the competing jurisdiction of the assizes and by lifting cases directly out of them by royal command . There were two ways to accomplish the latter . By a writ of right a suitor who felt he had been wronged in the baronial court could appeal to the king and have his case retried . Here the royal court acted more or less as an appellate court . But there was another method ? writ of prcecipe ? which achieved the same purpose in a more drastic and ferocious manner . By prcecipe , a suit could be stopped while  | it was still in the baronial court ; the barons were right when they claimed this was tampering with the feudal law . Though prcecipe was eliminated , the writ of right was still very much alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for exactly the same purpose . ( In the thirteenth century judges began to invent legal fictions , especially the writs of entry , by which a case that should have gone to a baronial court could be brought into the royal court . ) Once the centralization of justice is under way , it can not be stopped ; except for the hundred or so great barons , everyone likes it . Clause 34 is the last great , but doomed , effort of the magnates to maintain the shreds of their private jurisdiction . Clause 61 provides the sanction to ensure that the king upholds and maintains the charter . A committee of twenty-five barons is appointed to scrutinize the operations of the king 's government . When a complaint is received they are to ask the king please to cease his bad practice , and upon his refusal may proclaim feudal rebellion and proceed to fight him until he once again agrees to maintain the due process of the law . This is , of course , an unwieldy method of exercising control over the king 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king obeys the law of the land . Subsequent English history , from the thirteenth to the nineteenth century , is the story of how a satisfactory substitute for clause 61 was found , how a way to observe and control the king 's government and make it responsive to the community of the realm was slowly worked out . But the idea is here ; the problem after 1215 is one of institutional development , not of principle . It was a tremendously hard thing to achieve and a lasting solution was not to be found in the medieval period . Historians who say that the beginning of Parliament was a great step forward toward institutional control have a romanticized picture of what really happened in a thirteenth-century parliament , but this was to be a vast improvement over the committee of twenty-five . II . Thirteenth-Century Culture , Society , and Government OF ALL MEDIEVAL PERIODS , the thirteenth century is perhaps the most celebrated . It has been labeled " thirteenth , greatest of ceninrics " it has stood for an enviable synthesis , balance and harmony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of golden aspect to thirteenth- century civilization , a rich , autumnal glow that historians find very attractive . The trouble is that after 1300 medieval civilization fell apart , a fact that might lead us to consider what were the underlying tensions and forces of decay in this smooth and harmonious age . On the continent as well as in England the golden age rapidly deteriorated into chaos . It is curious that no one has been able to explain this or answer the nagging question : Why does misery immediately issue from such a grand consensus in intellect , politics and law , from the great cultural achievements ? There has been no clear answer , either for England or for European civilization . The most interesting writing about the thirteenth century has been done by F. M. Powicke , who , during his Oxford career from 1925 to 1948 dominated medieval studies in England , was acclaimed , and finally knighted . Powicke was a learned , intelligent man and a very careful worker ; his books tell us a great deal about what happened in the thirteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He never explains what was going on under the surface , what were the faults in this society that allowed such great problems to emerge after 1300 . Powicke never escaped from the sunny view of the thirteenth century ; his image was of a glorious , happy time in European civilization , one that has never been matched or surpassed . This is a warm and appealing view , but a superficial one . Powicke 's two-volume account of the reign of Henry III ( 1216-1272 ) , King Henry III and the Lord Edward , is a very detailed , accurate and meticulous work . But since Henry III was not a typical medieval ruler , it is not very valuable for general study ? though it does tell us what Henry III and the great barons were really like . Powicke 's volume on the thirteenth century in the Oxford History of England series devotes a tremendous amount of space to the wars in Wales and the incomprehensible disputes among Welsh warriors and lords . For readers who have a consuming passion for Welsh military history this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only cursory treatment . The second half of this book provides a fine account of Edward I ( 1272-1307 ) . Here we go in with the sun , come ( nit with the gloom . Powicke does a very good job of telling us what happened , but he does not delve below the surface , we do not learn why such darkness came on so quickly . One of the more controversial medievalists is G. O. Sayles who has probably the strongest mind of his generation of medieval political historians , although only late in his career has he achieved any fitting acaT H E E N G L I S H  | demic recognition . Sayles 's work became more and more filled with polemic against the academic establishment . This is not necessarily detrimental to scholarship ? it may , in fact , be salutary ? but obsessive attacks on Stubbs are bound to lead to extremism too . It is exactly this lack of balance that spoils Sayles 's most recent book . The Governance of Medieval England , written with his alter ego , H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rather pathetic tilting at windmills ; it is the equivalent of an American scholar 's effort earnestly to set about refuting Bancroft point by point . Sayles 's and Richardson 's work on thirteenthcentury Parliament is very good , but is also marred by excess of polemic . Sayles 's most important contribution has been to edit the legal records of the court of king 's bench . Here he successfully establishes that in the thirteenth century the common law had already begun to crumble , that in the reign of Edward I ? the so-called English Justinian ? the breakdown of law is apparent . A valuable work is T. F. Tout 's massive Chapters in Administrative History . Tout , who died in the 1930 's , was a professor at Manchester ; his early work was not particularly good , but he labored assiduously in the Public Record Office and produced these six volumes telling us how English government and administration actually operated in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries , a study of enormous interest to historians and sociologists who are concerned with the development of bureaucracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better and better ? for the thirteenth century , he was not yet sure of his methods and powers . One of Tout 's students , Bertie Wilkinson , was for three decades a distinguished scholar at the University of Toronto . In his three-volume Constitutional History of Medieval England , which covers the period from Magna Carta to 1485 , Wilkinson presents a neo-Stubbsian interpretation . Though critics have denounced Wilkinson 's work as ridiculous Whiggery , what he says about the thirteenth century can not be ignored ; it is quite possible that thirteenth-century barons were Whigs . Though Wilkinson 's books are full of echoes of the Victorian liberal myths , what makes them invaluable are the attempts at synthesis and the documents he publishes in excellent translation after every chapter . The first thing to note , when we turn to the thirteenth-century sources , is that we have now reached the point where there is unpublished material . For any new research , one must go to the Public Record Office I Amdon which is drafty and dusty , but where the people serve tea and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image of contem- porary Britain . ) New kinds of documents ? close rolls and patent rolls ? appear in the reign of Henry III . Almost all government documents , except writs , appear in the letters close or patent . The letters close ? ( " close " because they are folded up and sealed ) are short letters directed to a government agent instructing him to do something . They are direct descendants of the little Anglo-Saxon writs and , like them , are ad hoc , specific and crisp . Letters patent , which take their form from the charter , are open , quite formal , and bear official seals . They were sent from the crown to a public official ; they grant an office or issue general instructions that are often complicated and of long-range import .

In Latin , and very often in terrible handwriting , these documents do not inspire light browsing , but since the 1920 's , Calendars ? English summaries ? have been issued . Some administrative records , however , still remain unpublished , and the legal records have barely been touched . The thirteenth century is the last great age of the English chroniclers and we will miss them as we move on to the fourteenth . Their absence is , perhaps , one reason why historians are so confused about what was happening in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries .

The thirteenth century is the first era of English history where there is a genuine constitutional debate ; not until the seventeenth will the nature of government and society be so vehemently debated by men of learning and affairs . There are other parallels between the thirteenth and seventeenth centuries . Both suffered tremendous upheaval , perhaps this is why historians of each seem to find it so hard to apprehend what really took place . In order to grasp what was happening to government and society , there are four fundamental and pervasive aspects of thirteenth-century life we must be aware of . There are aspects of social change , which account for much of the confusion and turbulence of thirteenth-century history ; often elusive , they are , however , always present , and we will need to keep them in mind . They are the economic situation , war , education , and the friars . The most prominent economic aspect of the thirteenth century was , until the 128o 's and I290 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was making money in the most obvious and flagrant ways . Even the peasants prospered ; many were gaining legal manumission and legally , if not economically , they were becoming more or less free farmers . Capitalist agriculture was booming ? grain sold for high prices in market towns all over England ; this too was the period when the wool trade became the great staple of English commerce and industry . It is no exaggeration to say that everyone involved in it made money , and that everyone ? lords , merchants , gentry , churchmen , the king ? was involved in the wool trade . All members of landed society were concerned somehow with the raising of wool and shipping it from the eastern ports to Flanders . But inflation and prosperity , by the second half of the century , were producing side effects that engendered severe economic and social problems . The demand for agricultural products motivated landlords to bring an ever greater amount of marginal land under cultivation and to mine the soil recklessly for quick profits . By the end of the century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yields . In addition , as in all times of inflation and prosperity , there was an  | enormous population boom in the mid-thirteenth century . This led to extensive overpopulation in the peasant villages and slowed down the pace of manumission , because with a surplus labor supply the landlords could afford to be severe in their treatment of the manorial serfs . Finally , in the last two decades of the century , the great boom came to an end : war on the continent interfered with wool export , a significant amount of land went completely out of cultivation , the population started to level off , and even before the Black Death of the 1340 's , the demographic curve , that powerful and mysterious historical force , was already moving downward in England . These momentous economic changes , which have been elucidated by M. M. Postan 's careful researches and brilliant insights , follow a boom-bust , prosperity-depression cycle that is characteristic of unregulated capitalist economies .

In the last decades of the thirteenth century we rapidly pass from sun to darkness ; there is a sudden shift , not only from prosperity to depression , but also from peace to war . Until the 1290 's , the thirteenth was the century of the long peace ; we shall not see another again until the nineteenth . From the Battle of Bouvines in 1214 ( when John and the German emperor were defeated ) until the 1290 's , there was no important war . This is a factor of great significance ; without war government is likely to have a much easier time .

This king 's highest ambition was the expansion of the frontiers of England . Edward was the first English king who was really interested in conquering the Celts . Certainly the marcher lords had already forced their way into Wales , had carved out a few estates iii Ireland , but until Edward no English king has purposefully tried to establish a hegemony over Britain . And Edward did succeed in  | conquering Wales ; he even ? with much less success ? became involved in Scotland . The 1290 's , which happened to be the end of prosperity , also brought the great war with France , a clash between ambitious , headstrong kings who could draw ? so they thought ? on substantial resources . And they had a compelling motive , what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gascony , the wealthy wine-producing area , and of Flanders , the great European industrial center . The real issue was who would be the dominant power in northern Europe . Edward put forth a good deal of nationalistic propaganda , such as the claim that the French were bent on destroying the English people , but this was the real issue . Once it started , the war never stopped for a century and a half . School children know it as the Hundred Years ' War , but we could properly call it the 150 years ' war ? it dragged on from the 1290 's until the middle of the fifteenth century , when both sides were exhausted and both England and France were in chaos . There were some peaks ; from 1294 the war was waged intensively until 1303 . After three decades of occasional conflict , Edward III revived the war in full force and it sputtered out in the 1370 'S . There was intermittent conflict in the last two decades of the fourteenth century , and then the full-scale war started up again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conclusion of the long , wearisome conflict nothing very much had been accomplished . The war is , however , significant for two things . It was the first great European war , and it inaugurated that now familiar phenomenon , the war economy . All the resources of the crown will be organized and geared for the war effort , and the shift in government from a peace to a war economy means that its entire outlook and tone will change too . The war with France was a good thing for one group of people ? the aristocracy . Under the Angevins the baronage had been driven hard and , even in the thirteenth century , their future is still uncertain . For the simple reason that they were the generals , the French war brought them back on stage in a grand way ; it revitalized them as a class . War gave the aristocracy license to raise what were , in effect , private armies ? an earl would command a good-sized body of troops who were loyal directly to him . This will soon create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the king who provided their new life and force by ending the long peace . The thirteenth century is the first great age of the English universities ;  | " university " then stood for Oxford and Cambridge ? in some ways it still does . The famous founding of the university is very hard to pinpoint . Whenever the masters incorporated themselves , the university was at that moment in existence . This is what " universitas " ( literally , " corporation " ) means . But though Oxford existed in the twelfth century , it did not flourish until the thirteenth . Then , for the first time , a lot of people are beginning to take English B.A. 's ? although afterward they may still go to the continent to study something useful like Roman law . Cambridge in 1200 was still nothing but a bridge over the river Cam , but Oxford was becoming rather rowdy and distracting and , after a particularly violent town-gown riot , a hardy group of students and masters set off for the remote and undisturbed East Anglia swamps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . In fact very little was heard of Cambridge until the sixteenth century when the new humanists and the preaching of a few radical Protestants put it on the map . But thirteenth-century Oxford was , along with Paris , one of the two greatest centers of thought and learning in Christendom . By the 1260 's and 1270 's the most brilliant and advanced thinkers in Europe were to be found at Oxford working on the frontiers of knowledge . What they were doing was nothing less than creating modern science . This stunning phase of exploration of mathematical propositions and experimentation in the natural sciences , is linked with the arrival of the Franciscans in England . The appearance of the friars has not been sufficiently recognized as a critical event in thirteenth-century England . A new and radical wing had developed in the thirteenth-century church and a new outlook and technique was expressed in the mendicant orders . This idea ? a great idea which , had it come a hundred years sooner , would have saved the Catholic church from decline and schism ? was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piety working in the world . There were two new orders , the Dominicans ? Order of Preachers ? and the Franciscans ? the Order of Friars Minor , or Little Brothers . The Dominicans were not very active in England ; they were the leaders of the Inquisition , and thirteenth-century England was the only country in Western Europe that , having no heretics , had no Inquisition . In the fourteenth century , when heresy proliferated , the king 's refusal to let the Inquisition into the country was of tremendous significance for subsequent English legal history . On the continent , secular law copied from the Roman law which the Inquisition used to such good effect ; an Inquisition in England might T H E E N G L I S H  | well have influenced the procedure of the common law too . Though it is perilous and hard to speculate about negative influences , there is something very important here . The Franciscan order exerted a profound influence on thirteenthcentury English life , on the religious thinking of ordinary people , peasants and burgesses . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding and in response to their needs . An appeal to the personal and emotional sources of religious life was bound to deemphasize the hierocratic social functions of the church . Perhaps the seeds of English heresy were planted here , perhaps the Franciscan influence on experiential religion will flower in Lollardry and the radical heresies of the sixteenth century . There is a discernible continuity over the centuries of personal , puritanical , non-sacramental religion . And , as a result of Franciscan infiltration , the university produced two men of transcendent genius ? the logician Duns Scotus , and the logician , metaphysician , politician cum child prodigy , William of Ockham . Ockham and Scotus were teaching at Oxford in Edward 's reign . Anti-Thoinist , and anti-papal as well ( Ockham denounced the absolute authority of the Pope , appealed instead to church councils and even beyond that to individual conscience ) , their thinking had an important impact on the English church . Now its personnel would come out of Oxford tinged with radical ideas . Unfriendly to Rome , unenthusiastic about the old notions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an English heretical movement . Some of these radical men will find work in royal government ; they will not be great servants of the Pope ; on the contrary , they will not hesitate to support the king against the Pope . And every decade , the growing strength of anti-clericalism and anti-papalism encourages intransigence on the part of royal officials . Radicals , extremists ? these are exactly the kind of men the king needs . Some of the Franciscans end as political radicals . In the 126o 's there will be an alliance between some of them and the baronial movement . The Franciscans do not like the Pope ; the barons do not like the king ; Henry III , who was closely allied with the Pope , is their common enemy . The most radical , extremely hostile attitude toward the royal power is expressed in a poem =Mac Song of Lewes " ? written by a Franciscan friar . We can say that the friars acted as dissolvents of the structure of medieval society . They nourish budding radical movements , they support the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political radicalisni of the bacons against the king , they support and enhance the  | baronial view of the constitution . It is hard to work out this confused chain of cause and influence . There was a bubbling up of new ideas , ideas that undermined the hierocratic view of society . The friars offered a new view of the world , a new mode of life and of thought . These ideas will have subtle and various effects on the way people will act . The tenuous connections between thought and action are difficult to work out ; often the connections can not be made in an explicit way . But , as we try to make sense out of this shifting and puzzling century , we should keep in mind these four crucial factors : prosperity and depression ; peace and war ; the universities ; the friars . In the thirteenth century we can , for the first time , legitimately call the barons " aristocratic . " Now their self-consciousness becomes highly developed ; a class ethos , formally expressed in chivalry and courtly love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not merely whoever happens to be a baron or a tough fighter or a great landowner . He has to have something more ? the proper tone . He is superior in mind ; he has an exalted soul ; he is literate , knows how to act ? the way one does things . To be an aristocrat means that one is attuned to a very special , rarefied way of life . And no one else has got it ? this particular style , which somehow lurks in the blood of an aristocrat ; this is his breeding . Thus his blood must remain pure ? a notion that gives rise to a new code of gentility and of intellectual and social superiority . Not surprisingly , the aristocracy tends to see itself more and more as the " community of the realm , " the natural leaders of society . If there is something superior about their minds and their blood , it is only right that they should rule . They are the most important group in society ; they are its great oaks . What Burke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteenth . Simon de Montfort is really not a very different kind of man than the Duke of Newcastle , or Burke 's own Rockingham . The essence here is the style , the mode . Men who can kiss hands , and dance , and write poems , can run the government too . In the 1250 's and 1260 's they try . They assert their control over the government , and they fail completely . The Provisions of Oxford , which set up a permanent baronial council , were designed to make government and administration responsible to the aristocracy . But it does not work , and government lapses into chaos . Over and over we will witness the same kind of failure . Certainly , the aristocrats arc sophisticated ; they are well educated , they have a wide , national vision . But they suffer from two fundamental defects . They can T H E E N G L I S H  | never agree among themselves for very long ; jealousy breaks out almost at once , one earl always wants more than the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an aristocrat is never content to take second place . As soon as the king is defeated , aristocratic in-fighting and jockeying for position and power begins . Aristocratic government invariably means unstable government . The other weakness , which already appears in the 1250 's , will show greatly during the next two hundred years . They are lazy ? it is the defect of their quality . Men of this stamp can not be expected to sit around the exchequer and worry about sheriffs who bring in two pounds instead of five pounds ; they are too high-strung , of too fine a temperament . Very soon they become bored with the daily tasks of administration which are not , after all , specially elegant or dashing . The aristocrats arc capable of drafting magnificent programs , but they will not take pains . Aristocratic governments do not fall so much as they disappear . During the summer , the hunting season , the dancing season , government fades away , only to reappear during the winter . In the fifteenth century this pattern lasted for sixty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the summer . But for better or worse , beginning in the late thirteenth century , the aristocracy becomes very important in English life ; their leadership in society is secure . The gentry continued to thrive until the last two decades of the thirteenth century . They are entrenched in law and administration . There are two changes which enhance their legal and political importance and make them the most powerful group in society on the level of local ? and perhaps even central ? administration . In the thirteenth century an interesting official called the " keeper of the peace " appears ( soon he will be known as the justice of the peace ) . Appointed initially to assist the sheriff , his function was to maintain order in society . By the fourteenth century he is the most important peace and law official in the county ; he is recruited , and will be until the 188o 's , from the most influential and respected gentry in the county . The J.P . ' s will dominate the shire court ; by the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sheriff . Their glorious history is only beginning in the thirteenth century , but we can already see them in the later years of Henry III 's reign . The thirteenth century also saw a change in the legal profession , the decline of the clerical lawyer and the rise of the lay lawyer . Perhaps late in Henry 's reign , certainly by the reign of Edward , this has happened . ' Hie last great ecclesiastical lawyer in English history is Henry de Bracton ; after him they are all laymen from the gentry class . A  | corporate legal profession is formed ; entry into it is tightly controlled ? a lawyer must have certification , he must be called to the bar . All these formalities and restrictions emanate from one little place ? the Inns of Court in London . Already established in Edward 's reign , the Inns become the controlling body , they provide legal education , and they draw students and members almost exclusively from the ranks of the gently . ( The odd cases ? sons of merchants , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen . ) Law no longer belongs to the church , but to the knightly class , the landed gentlemen of England . The Inns of Court are their university . As a rule the gentry do not send their sons to Oxford , unless they are meant to be theologians ? something as rare then as it is now ? or clerics . Even if they do not become lawyers , young gentlemen spend a year or so at the Inns ; they learn land law , the basis of their way of life ; then they go back to the county and manage their family estates . More and more the gentry learn to identify their way of life with the operations of the common law , an identification that ? except for a short period in the fifteenth and sixteenth century ? will remain strong until the reign of Queen Victoria . Thus the gentry tightens its hold on local administration . They will provide central administrators as well ; many bureaucrats and all the justices will be gentry . A substantial proportion of the bureaucracy had always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church , now they will be landed gentry from the Inns of Court . And , as the clerics had once done , the gentry will rise to be great ministers of the crown ? by the fourteenth century this will be happening . For the bourgeois , the thirteenth century was an era of terrible frustration . He was accumulating more and more money , but still had no political power . He could not find a way to breach the solid wall presented to him by king , church , aristocracy and gentry ? none would give him any real power . The burgess is an outcast from society ? a sociologist would be quick to label him alienated from the power elite . The only thing he could do was gain some recognition of his legal freedom . In the reign of Edward he finally gets what he wanted . By 1300 parliamentary taxation replaces tallage , and the burgess is summoned to Parliament . His rate of taxation is , of course , heavier than anyone else 's , a survival of his inferior status . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no choice but to pay half again as much as the landed classes . Then , late in the thirteenth century , his real calamities begin . The grain market declines because of t he depression , and the international war makes it harder than ever to T H E E N G L I S H  | ship wool . He still manages to do fairly well however ; he gets along . The political instability of the fourteenth century effectively puts an end to his economic well-being . For about 140 years the towns of England were considerably less prosperous than they had been in the thirteenth century ? not until the late fifteenth century will the bourgeoisie revive . Ordinary churchmen were caught unhappily in the conflict between friars and the old clergy ; between radical , experiential fervor and the old formal , sacramental religion ; and in the bitter struggles among papacy , king and barons . Henry III was the ally and servant of the Pope . Neither barons nor churchmen could approve of this ? it seemed to both that the king and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The king allowed the Pope to send Italian clerics to hold English offices ? this was an outright offense , and a growing national sense inflamed hostility toward Rome . The churchmen naturally sought to ally themselves with a national force , whoever would stand for England against Rome , whoever would give them light and direction ; the barons during Henry III 's reign , with the king himself during Edward 's . But the churchmen did not play these games to their gain . By the end of the thirteenth century they have lost their control over law and the law schools ; thus their influence on society has significantly declined . In the thirteenth century it is quite clear that the king is more than a personality ? he is what Maitland has called a " corporation sole . " The king has a dual quality ; one existence in his own person , and another in the crown . Even if the king is incompetent or uninterested , government can function without him ? the substance of his public authority lies in the crown , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate body , that the crown is more than the strengths and frailties of one man , is a tremendous advance . This idea also leads to great problems , and later we will be faced with them . Nevertheless , government still means ? until the eighteenth century it will mean ? the king 's government . ( Historians are addicted to comparing the reigns of Henry III and Edward I ? to Henry 's disadvantage of course ? and are fond of ascribing the comparative failure and success of the two monarchs to their personalities . Though it somewhat begs the question of how much success there really was in Edward 's reign , there is substantial truth in the old cliche . ) Henry III perfectly illustrates the saying that nice guys finish last . He was really a sweet person . Badly treated by history , Henry probably deserved ? much more than his wife 's brother-in-law , Louis IX of France , who was a puritan rather than a saint ? to be canonized . I leery was truly  | devout , he really loved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste in art was remarkably good ; he built Westminster Abbey , a respectable monument . Henry was a very decent , cultivated man , but quite hopeless as a king . There is no denying that many of the troubles of his reign fall squarely on his shoulders . His difficulties began when he was still a gleam in his father 's eye . John 's pursuit of Isabella , an obscure French countess , led to his fight with Philip Augustus , brought on his military defeats and the loss of Normandy . Henry never managed to do much better . Coming to the throne at the age of nine , he had an overprotected childhood , and not a particularly high intelligence . In the next few centuries we will meet a lot of kings like this ? sweet but stupid . ( One of them , Henry VI , was also the product of an English king and a Frenchwoman . ) Henry 's sense of the dignity of monarchy was either too archaic or too advanced ; he thought of himself as an irresponsible king , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magna Carta eluded his comprehension ; to the extent that he grasped the notion of consent , he thought it was a bad idea . Henry believed government belonged to him and that no one else , except perhaps the Pope , should control it . It was a respectable and sophisticated ( though unoriginal ) idea of kingship , but it was irrelevant to and out of touch with the English experience . After 1215 the barons will not let the king rule without consent ? they will not submit to arbitrary means of taxation or other authoritarian procedures . Administrative organs like the exchequer must be responsible to them . His supporters brought out the worst in Henry ; they made him irresponsible . The French relatives encouraged his idea of government ? what they wanted were soft jobs in it , and they urged Henry to rule without consent . The Pope , who was a Roman lawyer and an Italian as well , did not understand the problem at all . To him the baronial views were heretical , they shook and undermined the hierarchy ? if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be for some fanatic to suggest that the Pope was responsible to his bishops . Urged on , Henry let himself be pushed into sharp conflict with the barons . The magnates , of course , were not unselfish ; they wanted to get their hands on the royal treasury , to increase their power and status , and to oust the French relatives from their cozy sinecures . Ironically , the king 's French brother-inlaw , Simon do Montfort , who had inherited the great earldom of Leicester , became the leader of the dissident barons . Henry 's way of escaping from baronial pressure was to fall back on T H E E N G L I S H  | household government . Historians tell us that this was a very significant move , that for the next three or four centuries the household will remain an important and separate branch of government . Chancery and the exchequer , which grew out of the curia regis , are susceptible to the magnates . They arc the parts of the royal administration that are most exposed to baronial scrutiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semi-public institutions . This was exactly what the king wanted to circumvent ; the last thing he wished was to be accountable to the magnates in any way . Thus he turned to his household officials . He took obscure people , his personal servants , and gave them public power . Since they arc still technically his household officials , it is much harder for the magnates to scrutinize and control them ; it is a different matter than prying into the activities of the chancellor or the exchequer . It was hard for the great barons to cope with this move ; suddenly government was the king 's again ? certainly the household , which was taking over more and more government functions ? was the king 's . The chamber , that branch of the household concerned with the king 's bedroom , became a treasury separate from the old exchequer . By issuing writs under the privy seal ? to sheriffs , tax collectors ? the king siphoned off money from the exchequer and directed it into the chamber . We will see many operations of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixteenth century the king will still be thinking them up . It is a shrewd and effective way to avoid public gaze and public accountability . But it is also a very messy system . In part , taxation is now carried out by an old agency , the exchequer , and in part by a new one . This means there will be much confusion and overlapping , and a great deal of chaos is inevitable . Where the Angevin kings strove for clarity and system , the raison d'etre of this new method is ambiguity and mystery ; it makes system impossible . In the late thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the growth of chamber administration is one of the causes of everincreasing maladministration and inefficiency . The leaders of the community will also become more and more suspicious of the king , and they will spend much time and energy attempting to gain control of his household . They never succeed , even in the fifteenth century ; rather the household and the royal council control Parliament . ( This long story , elucidated by Tout , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Administrative History of England . ) ' Thus the monarchy remains personal ; but it tends even more to conic into conflict with the barons , whose efforts to control the government  | are frustrated by the elusive nature of household administration . Henry was not clever enough to work chamber administration properly . He fell into debt , and only a meeting of the curia regis and grants of gracious aid could rescue him . A king who tries to run his government from his own bedchamber and kitchen can only succeed if he does not have to ask the barons for money . When he does , they will invariably demand to know what his cook and chamberlain have been doing . During the next three hundred years those kings ( particularly in the late fifteenth and sixteenth century ) who manage to work the system properly and skillfully hardly ever need Parliament . It is a game with very strict rules . A king who insists upon a personal administration must carry it all the way ; he can not play it both ways , he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when he is in difficulty suddenly emerge in his public capacity as crown . This is the fundamental aspect of all constitutional crises of the next two hundred years . Kings try to manage with household government , but they do not make it work ; then in desperation they call upon landed society for assistance , at which point trouble ensues . ( The tremendous trouble the seventeenth-century Stuarts got themselves into may be seen to represent , in a way , exactly this kind of constitutional problem . ) Henry fell into financial difficulties because he listened to the Pope . Rome 's struggle with the German emperor had thrown the Pope into a panic . In the 1250 'S , terrified of being caught in a pincers movement , he was looking for a way to evict the German imperial family from southern Italy . The Pope 's idea was to put Sicily on the block ; whoever paid would presumably drive the Germans out in order to take possession . Henry was weak-minded enough to get involved ; he gave the Pope a huge down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the installments , the Pope sold Sicily to France . Now Henry had neither money nor territory , and he had to turn to the barons . Once again he had been outsmarted by his brother-in-law , Louis IX . Louis was always one step ahead of Henry ? in sanctity , in politics , even in war ; he defeated Henry in battle in a pointless war that lasted a few weeks . Thus Henry lost Sicily , lost some of his land in France and , when he turned to the barons for help , he virtually lost his throne . Under the leadership of Simon de Montfort , the barons insist that if the king wants money , what they want is reform , and the royal government was in effect put into commission . In accordance with the baronial reform plan , set down in the Provisions of Oxford of 1258 , a comT H E E N G L I S H  | mittee of barons " on behalf of the whole community of the land " takes over the operation of the royal administration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxation function , in their interest , and to prevent the king from using household officials as his personal agencies , free from scrutiny by the Great Council . All tax receipts , the Provisions of Oxford decree , shall come to exchequer " and not elsewhere . " The thirteenth-century aristocracy , with its grandiose self-esteem , has for the moment attained the fulfillment of its highest ambition ? control over the resources of the crown . But the baronial party 's hold on power is a tenuous one . First of all , there is rumbling from below . The upper stratum of the gentry is deeply suspicious of the baronial reform plan ; it suspects law and administration will now serve the aristocracy , and perhaps be even less concerned with the welfare of the " knights " than were Henry III and his French relatives . And in what does the gentry 's wellbeing consist ? In legal protection of their landholding . They want assurances that Magna Carta 's application of the due process of the common law to seisin will be specifically applied to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party gives the gentry this assurance : " Without the king 's writ , no one may henceforth distrain his free tenants to respond concerning their free tenements . " The knights are satisfied ; they can now rest assured that baronial government will not subvert their land tenures . But the king could not be satisfied ; he was restless and unhappy . The Pope and St. Louis told Henry that this was no way for a king to run his government and his other French relatives complained , too . In 1264 Henry went to war against Earl Simon and the baronial party and was beaten at the Battle of Lewes . The only reason the king survived at all was that the great earls fell to quarreling at their moment of triumph and many of the other barons drifted away from Westminster during the hunting season . Simon 's hasty summoning of representatives of the knights and burgesses to a " parliamentum " could not counterbalance the effect of this disintegration of the baronial reforming group . Henry 's able son Edward escaped from captivity , raised an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry was declared in possession of royal power " without the impediment or contradition of anyone . " Those barons and gentry who did not agree were declared disinherited ? dispossessed of their property and status . A few hotheads did refuse to accept the reassertion of royal authority and took to the woods as outlaws , per- haps to be memorialized as Robin Hood and his Merry Men in popular legend . Henry had regained control over the royal government , but there was no hiding the fact that his reign had been one disaster after another . But Edward I had learned one thing from it ? to be tough and sneaky , to move fast , faster than the barons could follow , to play one group against another . Edward 's entire reign was one great shell game . Until recently he has had a very good press , his reputation has been on a level with Henry II and William the Conqueror . In a sense Edward was a national king ; when he went to war against France , he made strenuous efforts to advertise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malevolence . Although Edward proclaimed this role in Latin and French , he clearly did have some sense of the distinctive identity of the English people . Edward liked to think of himself as the leader of the whole national community ? not only the lay and ecclesiastical barons , but also the knights of the shire , the bourgeoisie , even the lower clergy . He was indifferent to what remained of the old feudal system of land tenures , and in his statute of Quia emptores , he prohibited further subinfeudation , thereby accelerating the complex social and legal process that was bringing all landed society directly under the jurisdiction of the crown . Edward was intelligent , and he had glamour and stature . He had a great reputation as a crusader , and he began his reign in an aura of holiness and heroism . It was this aura that allowed Edward early in his reign to carry out a systematic inquest into the privileges and franchises of lords and towns , in which the royal investigators demanded to know by what warrant ( quo warranto ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in many instances the royal warrant could not be produced , either because the charter had been lost or because the franchise was an illegal usurpation . The royal officials had a wonderful time either cutting down on baronial and urban franchises or eliciting substantial payments for new charters from the king . For twenty years the king managed to maintain the glamour . Edward never thought about institutions , or precedents nor ? until the last few years of his life when he saw that his son was incompetent ? did he worry about what would happen after him . He played a grand game ? for land , power , wealth , military repute ; he cared about these things , but not at all about how he got them . What he did with Parliament was bound to establish a precedent ; it inevitably turned an occaT H E E N G L I S H  | lion into an institution , it created problems for his successors . Edward made Parliament so important that after him no king could rule without it . He also made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep his game going , and again he did not worry about the consequences . He approved a vast reorganization of the land law ? a change that suited the interests of the great barons , but he never reflected about its implications . Edward had a buoyant , energetic , optimistic temper , and he overstepped himself . It seemed that he could do anything ? conquer Wales , invade Scotland ? he thought he could take on the king of France as well . He should have worried about this plan ; it took him in over his head and it cost him more money than he could afford to lose . In the last years of his reign , government was in deep trouble , it had to resort to dangerous expedients for raising money ? often to reckless , improvident schemes . The expulsion of the Jews from England in the 1290 's was , in the middle run , silly ; though the crown seized all their property at once , though for the moment Edward must have felt rich , he had killed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so desperate for money that he stooped to calling together the wool merchants at York to grant him an increased customs tax . After demeaning himself , he did not even get the tax ? by this time even the merchants knew that taxation had to come through Parliament , not individual communities . In spite of his self-confidence and his many talents , Edward was not a good administrator ; we can see that the problems that plagued government in the next 150 years were already there in his reign . Judges were corruptible , juries were bribed , the aristocracy dominated the assize courts , and to get justice in the courts a man needed a lord to maintain him . ( Later this kind of " maintenance " will give rise to all sorts of evils , and it will become a sinister word . ) Edward was careless , he let things get sloppy and run down . He had great force of character and dash , but he did not pay attention . The growth of household government was the nemesis of efficient administration ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pockets ( even bishops were doing it , and it was not very hard amid all the confusion ) , and the money trickled away . All these things will be very characteristic in the next century and a half , but they are already there during Edward 's reign . Administration is not precise , accounting breaks down , corruption is the norm , and the common law is notorious for its injustice ? this was Edward 's legacy , along with Parliament , though Edward would have been surprised to learn this startling fact .  | III . Parliament , the Common Law , and the Debate on the Nature of the Constitution IT IS HARD TO ACCOUNT for the lengthy and fierce historiographical debate on the origins of Parliament ? the documents we have seem too scanty and insufficiently obscure to support so many weighty arguments . According to the documents , the problem has no right to be so complicated . For the thirteenth century these consist almost exclusively of parliamentary writs . Historians have had to raise all their theories on the writs of summons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work with . Not until 1376 do we get a detailed but unofficial account of a debate in Parliament ? we will not have a full official record until the nineteenth century . The first important discussion of the history of medieval parliaments took place late in the sixteenth and in the early part of the seventeenth century when the claims that members of the House of Commons had always enjoyed certain privileges sent scholars scurrying to search for records . The debate on privileges continued for centuries ; the raising of the issue in the reign of Elizabeth I had the salutary scholarly effect of saving the thirteenth-century writs from being eaten by rats in the Tower of London . In the 182o 's a committee of the House of Lords undertook a detailed study to answer the question , " What is a peer ? " and produced some very good scholarly work . Then came Stubbs , whose work on Parliament has been likened to the Book of Genesis in that it describes an act of creation that is no longer believed . Stubbs saw the Parliament of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a consequence of the rise of the middle class ? that Victorian , but scarcely thirteenthcentury , phenomenon . The new importance of knights and burgesses dictated their integration into what we now know as the power structure . For Stubbs the three estates of the realm existed right at the beginning ? he could see them clearly in Simon de Montfort 's summons of knights and burgesses in 1264 and 1265 . Thirteenth-century Parliament was a national assembly of estates of the realm , in which the presence of the third estate was a reflection of their new national importance . Parliament , says Stubbs , was summoned primarily to assent to taxation and legislation . It is easy to criticize Stubbs , but in his massive , heavy-footed overstatements lies a great deal of truth . 227 T H E E N G L I S H  | Stubbs had worked entirely from writs . In his introduction to an edition of a newly discovered 1305 Parliament roll ( published in 1893 ) , Maitland gently but surely undermined Stubbs 's sweeping interpretation . Maitland found that something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived and after they had gone as well : the commons did not appear to be a fundamental or necessary element of a " parliamcntum . " And the found that the 1305 Parliament was not asked to consent to any taxation ? at this assembly it is hard to find a shadow of the economic influence of the middle class that so impressed Stubbs . The chief business of the knights and burgesses was , it seemed , to present petitions ; assent to taxation or legislation was not the reason for their presence . They came to complain about corrupt juries and incompetent sheriffs , to request new bridges , to ask for all sorts of favors ? but not to assert themselves as representatives of a new and powerful class . They are at ' Westminster primarily to ask the king to do something for them . Thus Maitland concludes that Parliament was simply a different name for the curia regis , that its key members ? the men who make it go ? are the same men who were important in the old curia regis : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knights and burgesses appear only as petitioners before the king 's court ; Parliament is fundamentally the old curia regis . The view of Parliament that Maitland propounded neatly coincides with a definition set down by Fleta , a legal writer in the early fourteenth century : " The king has his court in his council in his parliaments , there being present his prelates , earls , barons , magnates , and other skilled men , and there are terminated doubts concerning judgements , and new remedies are devised for new wrongs that have arisen , and justice is done to each one according to his deserts . " Maitland 's interpretation , a marked departure from Victorian Whiggery , was , as usual , brilliantly set forth . The court theory was quickly taken up by C. H. Mcllwain in The High Court of Parliament , published in 1910 . He picked up where Maitland left off , and put forward the thesis that until the seventeenth century Parliament must be considered mainly in terms of its legal functions ; that until then it was essentially a high court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twentieth century , two divergent lines of thought on the problem : the Stubbsian vision of a legislative assembly and the Maitland theory , worked out in detail by Mcllwain , that Parliament was a high court . In the 1930 'S and 40 's , G. O. Sayles and H. G. Richardson further supported Maitland 's interpretation in several highly learned and polemical studies .  | But the 1930 's also marked the appearance of a kind of neo-Stubbsian interpretation that maintains the bishop was basically right , but does concede that his work needs to be modified . Though the essential function of Parliament may have been to legislate , the knights and burgesses were petitioners too . J. G. Edwards , director of the Institute for Historical Research , pointed out ( in a brilliant article published in 1938 ) that completely to embrace the high court theory is to overlook some important things in the writs , particularly one critical phrase that instructs the sheriff to summon two knights from every shire with full power ( Mena potestas ) to represent their communities . Why should the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assent to binding legislation ? The king did not want them to come with full powers merely to hand in their petitions ? it must be that he wanted them to consent , in his presence , to new taxes and to statutes . He needed to avoid the chance of any subsequent claims , when taxes were actually being collected , that the representatives had overstepped their authority . The knights were invested with full authority to speak for the county so that whatever they assented to would be law . Another theory , one that seems very obvious now , says that Parliament functioned as a propaganda and information agency of the crown . This was put forth rather casually around the time of World War I by Georges Lefebvre , who later went on to become the great historian of the French Revolution . Lefebvre happened to be research assistant to Charles Petit-Dutaillis , who was in the midst of revising Stubbs . Although he had only looked at a few writs , it seemed quite clear to Lefebvre that the king 's main purpose in summoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , and that once everyone was assembled , taxes might as well be levied with consent . If the king wanted to go to war , or change the law , the knights and burgesses had to be informed sooner or later . Of course he could send out writs , but it was surer and more convenient to bring everyone together . Since the reign of William the Conqueror dissemination of information had always been one of the main functions of the curia regis . The king 's council was always the hub of the communications network . Now , however , when the feudal hierarchy was no longer powerful enough to serve as a communications medium , the meeting of the magnates alone could be relied upon no longer . The king had to communicate directly with the gentry , now the real administrators of his realm ? they arc the men who have to know what the king is doing . Thus Parliament merely continued ? in an extended T H E E N G L I S H  | and modified fashion ? the old information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lefebvre thesis has been revived by J. R. Strayer of Princeton , and it is a very plausible and convincing idea . Of all the theories , this is probably the one that most closely approaches the way Edward 's government actually thought about Parliament . It was a convenient way to announce policy . Edward never worried much about obtaining consent and approval for his policy decisions , if he could get away with it . His real concern was that everyone who mattered knew what the royal policy was and expedited it . As in many other constitutional developments in English history , expediency played a more direct role than theory in the origins and growth of Parliament . A subsidiary theme in the prolix parliamentary controversy is the debate over the origins of representation . It is strange that this aspect should be secondary , since the evidence allows much more scope for genuine controversy and legitimate argument . Stubbs was the great proponent of the common law origin of representation . As early as the reign of Henry II , he said , representatives of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even to Westminster . The sheriff chose two men to represent the county " to bring up the record " of the shire court in legal procedures ; from this , it was no great leap for the sheriff to choose men to represent the county in political procedures . At this point the high court thesis can fruitfully be integrated with Stubbs 's idea ? there was little difference between representing the county before the king 's bench or before the high court of Parliament . It is a logical transition , only a matter of degree , and it was an easy and natural development . Stubbs 's theory has most recently been supported by Bertie Wilkinson , who traces it even further back ? to the feudal idea of representation . The great barons had always spoken for their tenants ? even in the eleventh century . But social change had made this particular variety of representation obsolete and ineffective . The rise of self-consciousness among the gentry and the wealth of the burgesses had vitiated aristocratic authority . The magnates could no longer speak for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , responding to this new social situation , summoned representatives from the new communities . There is something appealing in this idea , though it is rather tenuous . There are also two quite radical themes that try to account for the development of the representative principle . One was put forward before World War I by Ernest Barker , who later gained great distinction as a political theorist . The idea of representation , he said , finds its gene- sis in the habits of the Dominican order which practiced representative government on a grand scale . Aware that they were the shock troops of the church , they rationally set out to draw upon all the talent they could muster , and once every year the friars sent representatives from all over Europe to an international meeting of the Dominican chapter general . If we had any satisfactory evidence of Dominican influence in thirteenthcentury England we would have to take Barker 's theory very seriously , but it happens that the Franciscans , not the Dominicans , were the important order of friars in England . In the 1260 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they particularly influenced the baronial leader Simon de Montfort . The Franciscans propagated many new ideas , but representation , which they did not practice , was not one of them . Barker 's thesis , though readily disproved , did stimulate people to think about the origins of representation within the context of religious thought and intellectual life and to look more closely at the spread of Roman law ideas . Roman law as well as canon law clearly expressed the concept of attorneyship , and men like Bracton were very learned in both . Gaines Post at Princeton believes that this idea was assimilated by crown lawyers who , when they instructed the sheriffs to send representatives to Parliament , were simply propagating what they had learned from Roman law . It does seem possible that the Roman idea of attorneyship , coming to England through the clerical servants of the king , may have reinforced the practice of representation and sharpened its focus . But the most important breeding ground of English representation was the common law , and perhaps to some extent , the feudal hierarchy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extension of the curia regis , but then we must also say that certain meetings of the curia regis were occasions for obtaining consent to taxation and legislation . A convenient opportunity was grasped ? it was practical to bring the urban and rural representatives here , to consent as well as to present petitions . An old institution was infused with new life ; no longer was it sufficient to secure the consent of the magnates alone . They could no longer speak with certainty for what was now the most important group in rural society , nor were they any longer responsible for carrying out royal policy at the county court . If we look closely we can see in these embryonic parliaments the overlapping of old and new functions . And we can see how pragmatic these meetings were , to what degree they were prompted by expediency . Parliament was not inevitable . Until 1300 taxation and legislation could have been accomplished by other methods . T H E E N G L I S H  | In 1207 the consent of the magnates at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property . It is no coincidence that the period of the emergence of Parliament is also the era of the rise of a new system of national taxation for which this tax in 1207 was the precedent . Parliamentary consent became the legal sanction for national taxation and in its pristine form of a gracious aid taken with consent of the magnates , the essence of parliamentary taxation already existed in 1207 . The basic procedure was there ? only the knights and burgesses had to be added in order to make it complete . The first move came in 1213 with the Oxfordshire assembly of knights summoned by the king . By then the king was already conscious of the importance of the gentry . John knew very well that a feudal rebellion was brewing and he hoped that by talking things over with the knights he might secure their support . But nothing came of this , and in the 1230 's and 1240 's gracious aid was obtained by Henry III with the consent of the magnates only . Then , in 1254 , we are confronted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France , the regency , which has many vexing and urgent problems to cope with , calls together an odd sort of assembly that does include representatives of the shires as well as magnates . The legal and technical nature of this meeting is obscure , but the idea of county representation was clearly active in 1254 . In 1264-65 we get the famous Oxford parliamentum of Simon de Montfort . The crown is in commission and the baronial government , desperately in need of money , calls a special meeting of the king 's council to which both knights and burgesses are summoned . The barons are a revolutionary party acting against the crown , they want to implement great reforms . They must have money , but the lines of the feudal hierarchy are too weak to provide it . The new , insecure , barely legitimate government can not count on the automatic support of the knights and burgesses ? it must have their overt consent . And Edward I , who was a very pragmatic man , took over this readymade procedure . He used it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customs tax . The " great custom " was levied with the consent of the magnates , knights , and burgesses . After this the government began to worry ; they realized that it was not necessary to bring the knights and burgesses together ; it might instill a feeling of solidarity and identity among the various communities of the realm . This could he troublesome ; it was clearly in the government 's interest to keep them divided . Edward knew that the French king obtained consent through several separate meetings , that lie avoided the dangerous practice of bringing  | everyone together . In the early 1280 's and 1290 's the English government tried similar methods . Hence 1282 saw the peculiar scheme called Kirkby 's Quest ? a royal official named Kirkby rode through all the shires getting consent from each community individually , but this took a ridiculously long time . Other plans were tried ; separate meetings of magnates , knights and burgesses were introduced , as was the practice in France . But it was more expedient for the English crown to obtain consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow and cumbersome , and Edward was a greedy and impatient man . Thus after a hiatus of several years , Edward in 1295 went back to the comprehensive assembly ; he even brought in representatives from the lower clergy ( who after 1330 were to meet in a separate convocation ) . The evolution of Parliament in Edward 's reign is very clear . At the beginning taxation was imposed with consent in a full Parliament . Then Edward backed away . It was obvious that this kind of meeting was a potential hazard . But once Parliament had been used , he found all other methods of taxation inconvenient and unwieldly , so he went back to using the curia regis in its new function of national assembly . In his last years Edward became exceedingly wary ; he began really to worry about the possibility that the crown would be forced to depend on this new procedure . So he again searched for other expedients . But it was too late ; Parliament had been established , the precedent had been fixed . When in 1297 Edward tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consented , the barons indignantly claimed they were being " tallaged " ? arbitrarily taxed like mean serfs on the royal demesne ? and they made Edward confirm Magna Carta and the principle of due process and promise not to levy a tax without consent of the community of the realm . Edward 's son and grandson would become even more dependent on this new institution of Parliament . With the reign of Edward I , Maitland brought his great book to a close . By this time , he believed , the common law had assumed its definitive shape and form ; by the end of the thirteenth century the lasting structure of courts and procedure had been evolved and fixed . Also , from the 1290 's onward , the legal sources are so voluminous that just to absorb and digest them would require a whole lifetime . Only in outline , then , can we apprehend the subsequent history of English law . The common law existed as a distinct legal system by the end of John 's reign . Though it drew upon Germanic , Roman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of these things . It is , T H E E N G L I S H  | rather , the royal law , it runs in the royal courts , the king administers it . It is whatever his justices have worked out . In many ways the common law is imperfectly defined , it is not codified ; what the law is at any given time depends to a considerable degree on the judges and attorneys who operate it . The common law is a peculiar amalgam of three distinct kinds of legal systems ? but these basic elements have been reshaped and transmuted . It is , however , possible , and useful too ( so long as we recognize the special overriding royal character of the common law ) to analyze it by examining what it borrowed and preserved from its diverse sources . The common law perpetuated the Germanic conception of legislation , a negative idea expressed in a reluctance to accept the idea of positive legislation . In the thirteenth century men still believe they are declaring the law ; they claim they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a kind of omnipresent , fundamental substance , needs only to be declared and defined , dies very hard in England . ( Its ghost still haunts the eighteenth century . ) Some historians ? T. F. T. Plucknett , for example ? insist that a firm and viable idea of legislation existed by the end of Edward 's reign , but this is a fragile and unsupported thesis . Not until the seventeenth century is the idea that legislation is the manufacturing of new law clearly formulated and grasped . This aversion to positive legislation is part of the vestigial notion that law resides in the community and that only with the consent of the community can it be declared and confirmed . There was universal agreement on this point ; the only significant question in the thirteenth century was who constituted the community , who shall speak for it ? Was it to be the king and his judges and the magnates ? Did it also include the communities of the shire , and the boroughs ? This was the single most important question ? and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A royal justice at the end of Edward 's reign did not for a moment believe that legislation had to take place with the consent of the barons and the shires in a parliamentumthis would be a shocking concept . Some legislation , a very great deal in fact , was accomplished without any representation from the shires . Toward the end of the reign , however , we can see a certain sensitivity on this point , and by the mid-fourteenth century it is commonly acknowledged that the best , the most legal and the least controversial ? if not the only way ? is through Parliament . Even in the sixteenth century men were not absolutely sure what legislation was , nor were they at all certain that the voice of the community necessarily spoke in Parliament . From  | the time of Edward I through the middle of the fourteenth century , however , it came to be understood that the nature of parliamentary statute was of the highest legality . Law placed on the statute roll was , in any controversy , the last and decisive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement ? it could not be a matter of dispute . Through the royal justices of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries ? clerics trained in Roman and canon law ? the common law absorbed ideas borrowed from Roman law . After Edward 's reign the clerical lawyers disappear ; from then on the legal system is controlled by lay lawyers trained at the Inns of Court , and the qualified reception of Roman law ceases until the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries . But , while the common law was being molded , Roman law ideas were current and influential . Civil law training inculcated a belief that the purpose of law is to obtain justice , that law aims to establish right in the kingdom . In the thirteenth century royal judges have strong feelings on this score , and in the late fifteenth century a concern for justice will stimulate the establishment of new kinds of courts . The conciliar courts of chancery and Star Chamber were then established to provide justice that was unobtainable through the common law courts . The common law also bored from the Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It should not really have been a difficult distinction to make , but in early Germanic law the point was confused and obscure . Eventually people would have stumbled upon it ? everyone did know that a criminal case was one you hung for ? but Roman law did encourage them to build the distinction into the English system . The third idea taken from Roman law was the concept that the king has both a natural ( personal ) and a political ( public ) body , that the monarchy is a corporation . This idea also emerged from general legalpolitical developments of the late eleventh and twelfth centuries , but the strong corporate and communal sense that informs Roman law helped the judges to conceptualize it . And in the thirteenth century they did ; the judges were able to perceive the monarchy as a crown corporation . The permanent influence of Roman law is a vexed question in English legal history and there has been much controversy about the extent of its " reception . " We can say that although Roman law did not directly form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it along certain lines . An awareness of Roman law ideas sharpened the conceptual focus of the common law ; thus a theoretical clement was introduced that was entirely absent in Germanic law . T H E E N G L I S H  | The feudal sources of the common law may be seen in their most undiluted form in the law of real property , which grew directly out of feudal laws concerning vassalage and inheritance . During the thirteenth century the feudal bonds of society lose their power ( although the aristocracy retained its wealth and influence ) and feudal ideas were revised and rearranged in accordance with the new social situation . Many aspects of feudal law were submerged , but the ideas of property survived and became the basis of English land law that was worked out in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries . The law of property is fundamental to English political thinking ; certain aspects of it , especially the concept of due process , impinge on general constitutional ideas in the most critical way . Maitland has remarked , provocatively , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land laws . Three elements ? Germanic , Roman , and feudal law ? are constituents of the common law which is , though , something more than any of them . The judges made of these elements a different blend ; they revised and reshaped them to create a system that does not exactly resemble any of its components . The common law worked out its own peculiar processes and procedure in the courts . By the first decade of the thirteenth century these achievements are clearly evident . And they are lasting ? we can still see them as fundamental to Anglo-American law . The great changes of the thirteenth century were in criminal law procedure . On the whole , what happens in thirteenth-century civil law is evolutionary ; we observe variety and complexity , most significantly in the development and frequent use of legal fictions , which allow more and new kinds of cases to come to court . Once in court the subject of the plea can be changed ? this becomes extremely important in the land law . But this was a natural and predictable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to criminal procedure during the thirteenth century was nothing less than a judicial revolution . In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries , criminal pleas could be initiated in two ways : by appeal , a perpetuation of the Germanic process of personal accusation ( X accuses Y of felony before the court ) , or by jury of presentment ? the grand jury . Here the process is accusation by the community of the shire , through its representatives , before the king 's justices . Gradually the appeal was absorbed by the indictment . All appeals were made subject to review and authorization by the grand jury ? the shift probably took place in John 's reign . The judges ask the grand jury to certify that a personal appeal has not been made simply out of spite or  | hatred ; if the jury finds evidence of odio et atia the plea is stopped and the vindictive appellor is amerced . Only when the grand jury has decided a plea is plausible can they move on to consider the nature of proof . In 1215 the church forbade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue the practice . Maitland has written a brilliant account of the next six or seven decades during which the English judges sought a method of proof to replace the ordeal . The instability of Henry III 's reign meant that they were able to experiment ? they were forced to rely on their own judgment and imagination . It is interesting to speculate on what might have happened if a king like Henry II had been on the throne ? probably more Roman law procedures would have been introduced consciously . But without guidance or instruction , the judges went on with the grand jury . It already provided a viable method of indictment ; now , as they searched for a method of proof , they kept it in mind and eventually they worked directly with it . At first , however , they tried to improve the other method they were familiar with ? compurgation . They resurrected a tenth-century procedure , something called a " suit of witnesses " ? really a panel of blue-ribbon compurgators whose testimony the court could trust . Effective enough in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was no casual matter to bring suits of witnesses from all over the county ; it overwhelmed the little market town where the assizes were held ? there was simply no room , not enough organization . Furthermore , the judges had to rely on the judgment of these blue-ribbon witnesses , respectable men of substance who were simply not cognizant of most of the cases they were asked about . The men who did know were bound to be the same unreliables who had made compurgation a system of legal perjury . So the attempt to work with one handy and familiar principle broke down and the judges were driven to the only other system they knew . Thus a jury was asked to bring in a verdict just as another jury had made an indictment . The judges got to this very haphazardly , and only after they had stumbled ? sometimes in a simple-minded fashion ? along a path of pragmatic experimentation . At first the royal justices were not very confident about relying on the verdicts of men against God 's word and , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordeal , Henry II 's bench hesitated to give up the idea of compurgation . The first jury of verdict consisted of forty-eight men ? twelve from each of the four points of the compass . But it was not very practical to summon forty-eight men to the  | county seat . Many of them are bound not to appear , and the royal judges are not patient men . Perhaps by the 1250 's and 1260 's ? certainly by the 127o 's ? they have devised the petty jury : twelve men who decide the truth of an accusation made by the grand jury . This new procedure was astonishingly efficient . We have to assume that unless a defendant could take exception to his indictment by making a special plea , the proportion of petty jury convictions was extremely high . Both juries were selected from the same neighborhood people , and the grand jury indictment was usually decisive . This suits the judges . Even though the Roman law principles they arc always enunciating tell them they should be seeking justice , they are mainly eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the crown and move on to the next county . Royal justices did not lie awake at night wondering if justice was being done . They were not men known for their tender consciences . In the twelfth century they had relied on the voice of the community to a great extent ? in the thirteenth century they took it all the way . There is nothing a royal judge likes less than a hung jury , nothing could be calculated to annoy him more effectively . In common law procedure a hung jury was a very bad thing , a waste of time . It meant that the case had to be carried over , and this involved a whole other set of problems . The defendant himself was the biggest . Jail breaks seem to have been an everyday occurrence in medieval England ; obviously there was nothing hard about it . So the judges were pleased to get quick convictions ? and their attitude encouraged the juries . They knew it was not good for their community if the royal judges were irritated . The royal justices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge was likely to bring up some archaic and embarrassing technicality ? presentment of Englishry was a great favorite . There was also a serious problem of defense in the common law . The defendant had , first of all , to agree to abide by the judgment of the petty jury ? to put himself on the country . Here was a new procedure , a risky , untried method , and the defendant had the option of deciding whether he would submit to it . He knew , as everyone else did , that ninety-nine times out of a hundred the jury of verdict would not find contrary to the jury of presentment . No wonder defendants were not eagerly clamoring to come before the jury of verdict ? trial by jury had not quite become a sacred constitutional right . But a defendant who refused to " put himself on the country " was a nuisance . If he could not be prevailed upon by sweet reason , he was subjected to peine forte et dare , a charming method of persuasion . Weights would be piled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or died . It was an infallible procedure . If he put himself on the country he was hanged ? but he did have the privilege of choice . By the end of the thirteenth century the defendant is no longer asked his choice ? he is automatically put on the country . In the course of eight or nine decades the judges bring about the greatest single change ( in the method of proof , at any rate ) that has ever taken place in English legal history . Thus the jury of verdict came to be a definitive part of common law procedure . Another change in legal procedure appears in the second half of the thirteenth century , certainly by the reign of Edward I. This is the abandonment of the general eyre . The commission lists of 1194 tell us that the Angevin government ordered the itinerant justices to deal with everything concerning the crown ? political and administrative matters as well as judicial cases . This interference was bitterly resented by landed society ; royal judicial procedures were necessary to their way of life , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into taxation , was more than they had bargained for . This sort of prying was objectionable , and was the source of much knightly dissatisfaction . The gentry were to some extent justified here . The judges were very busy men , they were overburdened with tasks , they were tough , and their decisions tended to be swift and arbitrary . Royal judges were never chosen for their kind and sympathetic temperaments , and even with more leisure and less pressure , they would not have coddled or appeased the gentry . The judges were not interested in subtleties or mitigating circumstances ; they meant to secure for the king exactly as much as he could legally get , to see that no inch of property that might escheat to the crown remained in other hands . They were eager to discover and report to the king whatever might call for investigation . And though the gentry liked to bring their own cases into the royal court , they felt that the general eyre was not good for duc process . Therefore in Edward 's reign the judges are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead specific , restricted legal commissions . This may have had something to do with the fourteenthcentury decline in the wealth and authority of the crown . Without constant and rigorous scrutiny the monarchy will lose fees and income ; all kinds of revenue ? taxes in particular ? will slip through the royal fingers . But now administrative inquests can only be conducted on an ad hoc basis , and these irregular procedures demand more energy and ingenuity than fourteenth-century administrators could summon . Pressure from landed society around 1300 was thus able to confine the T H E E N G L I S H  | commissions of itinerant judges to special judicial matters . Some of them are still used . There were three kinds of legal commissions . The first was to hear criminal pleas ? the commission of jail delivery . This means exactly what it says ? empty out the jails ; do something about everyone found in jail ; prisoners must not be allowed to languish in jail . This commendable urgency was not , however , prompted by feelings of humanity or justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To clean out the jails and send the prisoners either to freedom or to the gallows was an imperative of crown policy . The second commission , nisi Arius , dealt with civil suits . At nisi prius all writs had to be returned , unless they had previously been dealt with ; this is the commission to decide all pending civil cases . The third commission was called oyer and terminer , a phrase taken from legal French , a peculiar jargon that lingered on in England for an amazingly long time . This bastard language is often nothing but mumbo jumbo and always very hard to decipher . Perhaps this is one reason why legal history is so full of blank spots and murky patches . Oyer and terminer means to " hear and determine " all pleas of the crown ? anything not covered under jail delivery or nisi prius . ( In England the clerk of the court still opens the session by announcing oyer and terminer . ) Another thirteenth-century development was the growth and settlement of the central court system . King 's Bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all , Parliament ? became more defined in their functions and , at the same time , much busier . Though no historian has worked this out in any detail , it is clear that toward the end of the thirteenth century snore and more civil cases involving substantial amounts of property are falling into the central courts . Civil cases that dealt with more than modest sums will now come immediately within the purview of the central courts . These are often difficult suits ; they involve legal complexities , provoke long , elaborate trials and demand skill and reflection on the part of the judges . It is only natural that they should come before a panel of judges at Westminster . In the reign of Edward I , the central judiciary also became more active in criminal pleas . King 's bench could now exercise original jurisdiction over any case that involved breach of peace ; it also served as the central court that could review , on a claim of erroneous judgment , any decision in the county courts . From this tendency toward judicial centralization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to obtain improvements in government , and  | society was to make a parliamentary statute . Constant resort to statute was a favorite fourteenth-century way to solve all sorts of problems . Statutes were passed to build bridges , and statutes declared there should be no obstacles to navigation on the river Severn . This one appears about six times in the fourteenth century and demonstrates a rather touching belief in the efficacy of statute . There was a naive faith in the magical properties of statute ; men apparently were convinced that by saying something was law they made it so . Thus fourteenth-century and early fifteenth-century Parliaments indulged in orgies of legislation . Later fifteenth-century governments saw the futility of this and a severe disenchantment with statute followed . At this point we get the shift back to conciliar government , where decrees and proclamations of the king 's council supplant statutes . But meanwhile there had been a medieval period when parliamentary legislation was important , when many things were registered on the statute roll . And the leaders of the House of Commons who claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything important without parliamentary consent , could cite the fourteenth-century statute roll as proof that the constitution was always like that . This was not a completely accurate claim , but it was quite true that , in contrast to the Anglo-Norman period and the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries , there was a time when statute had flourished . Thus a precedent was established ? a precedent so solid that even the Tudors paid obeisance to this early period of intense legislation . When they wanted to do something of tremendous consequence ? when they wanted to change religion or deny the authority of the Pope ? they did it by parliamentary legislation . It is not clear that they had to do it this way , but an act of Parliament was unquestionably valid . It was a way of stamping absolute legal confirmation on the king 's religious policy . The fourteenth-century parliamentary legislation set a precedent as well as a consciousness that statute was the soundest law . By endowing statute with the highest legality , the way was paved for the seventeenth-century claim that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clerical legal profession and the rise of the lay lawyer had an important impact on the course of the common law in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries . Men trained at the Inns of Court were not prepared to undertake codification or rationalization of the law . Nor were they interested . As practicing attorneys they rather liked the confusion and complexity that was already endemic in the common law . It had a built-iii bias in favor of the interests of the legal profession and T H E E N G L I S H  | the profession , which controlled every aspect of the law ? every judge and attorney came from the Inns ? was not eager for change . New law can be made by parliamentary statute , and existing law may be clarified by judicial decision . Where the law is silent , the judges can sift the precedents , they can stipulate what the law is on a specific and confused point . But there is no codification of English law . Because most of the legal profession were now ignorant of Roman law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could change only through parliamentary statute or judicial decision . In the reign of Edward I we are aware of a passion to collect judicial records . These are the precedents judges must use and cite in making their decisions . Even Bracton amasses precedents and tries to write down decisions made by himself and his colleagues on the bench . In 1292 the Inns of Court begin to publish Year Books ? text book compilations of important cases and decisions ? which will enable the judges to determine what the law actually is . We must not glamorize this practice or overestimate what is only a feeble effort at organization . There will be much confusion , clarification will come with agonizing slowness and for centuries much decision-making in law will fall upon the judiciary by default . The first full-blown theoretical debate on the nature of the constitution and the nature of kingship takes place in the thirteenth century . There had been constitutional conflicts in 1215 , but later in the thirteenth century , particularly during the reign of Henry III , men are able to articulate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What should be the office of the king ? " : this was the problem as well as the title of the most interesting treatise of the early thirteenth century . Written by someone in London , most probably by a cleric , possibly ? though less likely ? by a burgess , it reveals a great uneasiness about kingship . The author 's double vision of the king leads to tension and uncertainty ; it gives the work its anguished tone . The king is exalted , he is God 's representative on earth , the leader of the folk , he is every man 's liege lord . But at the same time the writer is racked by a concern that the king should be responsible to something or somebody ? the law , the community ? however these might be defined . This ambiguity lies at the heart of the debate . Everyone wanted to exalt kingship ; men sincerely believed that the king 's dignity and honor were and ought to be of the very highest . But what did this mean in relation to the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without consent , or is he responsible to the community for the law by which he rules ? ' I ' hew anxious questions signify a great advance in  | the verbalization of political issues ; this is really a debate over what the sixteenth century will call " the king 's two bodies " ? his natural and political body , his personal and public capacities . Men of perception in the thirteenth century apprehended this problem , it beset them and worried them . They do not express it so neatly , but they are painfully aware of it , and they agonize over it . It is a very hard problem indeed . In the thirteenth century the king was the vicar of God ? this was not just pious cant or simple-minded sentiment . Intelligent and sophisticated men believed it ; it was a deeply rooted and widely held emotional response to kingship . There was no other way to think about the king . Even when a weak unimpressive king like Henry III puts on the crown he evokes tremendous feeling . People respond positively toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the king himself is the embodiment of hierarchic principle and power of the mightiest kind . The king is the closest thing to God that men can see and know in the world , and they have a profound attachment to him . This makes the other side of the picture even more difficult ? what should one do when the king acts badly or meanly ? The duty of the king is to uphold the crown . This was how some thirteenth-century writers stated it , and here they hit upon the notion that there is a distinction between Henry Plantagenet and the crown . It was a common enough assumption . Most of the people who were part of the political nation thought this way ; they had a lively sense of the fundamental distinction . The king should uphold all things in the kingdom , including " the law of the land . " But this idea was still hazy and inchoate ; it was not of any use in formulating institutional decisions . It was exactly this unresolved double vision that led to so much tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they also expect him to support the law and rule with the consent of the magnates . Men assume that the king and the crown are inseparable , but when his two aspects did not fit together , when the magnates were forced to wrest the effective authority of the crown from the hands of the king , it must have been a great emotional wrench . Actually to fight against the king was a tremendous shock and disillusionment . Though sonic great barons were always ready to fight , most people were just lost and bewildered at the prospect . Another important treatise in the debate is the " Song of Lewes , " a poem of great power , written by a Franciscan friar who supported Simon de Montfort . Though it ultimately sets forth the political philosophy of the baronial party , the poem ' begins with an exposition of the king 's T H E E N G L I S H  | point of view about his own servants . If the barons can have their own stewards , why can not the king have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the choice of his government than his vassals are in the choice of their servants ? To restrict his authority in this sphere is to disparage him and the dignity of kingship . " The command of the king has the force of law " ? here the Justinian Code is quoted . What , then , is the answer ? The poet bids the baronial party speak . They are not hostile to the royal honor , they protest at first . All they want is to magnify the royal estate . ( This is the obligatory statement ? all men have to say they stand for Christ and the king . Like democracy and motherhood , today , these are the passwords ; men who fail to utter them mark themselves as extremists . They can not participate in the debate . ) " We give first place to universitas , " the barons say , to community . The magnates are the guardians of the law ; they are the ones to protect the kingdom against the king , the crown against the weak and foolish man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they proclaim . The community has a voice in the matters that concern it ? and here the barons show they too know how to cite Roman law maxims . " What touches all should be approved by all , " they say . The realm is not the king 's personal property ; if he misuses and damages the realm , the community must take it away from him . The highest thing in the realm is not the king , but the law ; indeed " law rules the royal dignity , for law is light and rules the world . " And law is the divine word itself ? is it not written in the gospel that " By me kings reign " ? The " Song " goes on to say that " No king shall change that established law , but shall find strength in it for his changing self . " The truly exalted king , then , is the one who rules according to law . This is heady stuff . Liberty is equated with the law alone , the law of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to fulfill his royal office in a way that brings him closer to God . The most kingly king is the one who rules according to law , and " Whoever is truly king is truly free . " This is a high and subtle idea that perhaps could only have been conceived by a Franciscan . It was an ideal of government , in fact , that few men in the thirteenth century could even have apprehended ? certainly not the rather slow Henry III or his cool and tough-minded son , Edward I. In his treatise Concerning the Laws and Customs of England , the learned and much venerated royal judge Bracton tries to cope with the problem of the king 's responsibility to the law . But lie does not really sue- ceed . By lifting passages out of context , Bracton can be made to sound like a nineteenth-century liberal , but most of the time he walks an uneasy line between the view that the king is responsible to God and the view that he is responsible to the community . Bracton himself can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be under God and the law ? rex non debet esse sub homines sed sub Deo et lege ( " the king ought not to be under men but under God and the law " ) was the memorable way Bracton stated it . Seventeenth-century polemicists were particularly devoted to this succinct phrase and we will see it cited over and over in later debates . It is indeed a splendid statement . But a couple of lines later Bracton also says that " no writ runs against the King . " If the king wrongs you there is no legal sanction against him ? one can only petition for mercy and redress . The king must maintain law ; where there is no law there can by no king . Where , then , is the sanction ? Bracton has a hard time finding any , because no action in law can lie against the king . He returns to this later . " There is no remedy against him by assize " ; the king can not be sued for violation of the law . Now Bracton sounds like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monarch must be approached on one 's knees . If the king behaves wrongly or contrary to law , God will be the judge , men can only be supplicants . This is no different from the divine right notions of the sixteenth century . In his heart Bracton believes finally that the king is responsible only to God . In case he wrongs you , you must beg for his mercy ; if he does not listen , you must weep and pray that God will see fit to remove him quickly . There is no other redress . Though this is what Bracton really believes , he also knows that many people do not agree with him , that they are convinced the community of the realm has the right and duty to maintain the royal estate against the king himself . When the king destroys law he is destroying his own dignity ? this is their reasoning and their justification . This was about as far as the medieval constitutional debate progressed . The thirteenth century left it hanging on an unresolved note , but with a growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain the law . It was argued that the king should be made responsible , that men can rebel in order to preserve the crown against the king . What they lacked , however , was any institutional control ; the theory existed ; at times it was even formulated with force and clarity . But there was no way to implement it . This institutional weakness is fully apparent in the last decade of Edward I 's reign . By the 1290 's the king 's glamorous image has evapoT H E E N G L I S H  | rated , and the barons are weary and disillusioned by war and heavy taxation . In 1297 they refuse to serve overseas in the war with France over Flanders and they draft a protest document , De tallagium non concedendo , claiming they have been " too much worn down " with excessive and illegal taxes . The literal translation of the title of their manifesto , which is put in the form of a petition to the king , reads " Tallage must not be conceded , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without representation . " The barons want the king to promise that " no tallage or aid be levied by us or our heirs in our realm , without good will and assent of the archbishops , bishops , earls , barons , knights , burgesses and other freemen of our realm " ? in other words no taxation without Parliament as it had been constituted in 1295 . This concession the king refuses to make ; government belongs to him , not the community of the realm . He makes a formal recognition to maintain the law of the land by confirming Magna Carta , and promises merely that henceforth he will only tax " by the common assent of the whole kingdom , " leaving undefined the institutional form of such assent . Furthermore , Edward makes this concession " saving the right of our crown , " a phrase that a contemporary chronicler tells us the barons rightly found " ambiguous . " In 1305 Edward obtained from the pliant papacy absolution of his vow to observe even these limited and ambiguous concessions . In the 150 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crisis of 1297 would be raised again and again , without any clear decision as to the precise relationship between crown and community , and in the seventeenth century the constitutional debate would be pursued once more , only this time at last to be argued , and fought , to a conclusion . In the seventeenth century re-enactment of the thirteenth-century constitutional debate , the conflict finally took the form of war against the king in order to maintain the authority of king-in-Parliament . The theory of government enunciated by the House of Commons when it took up arms against the king in 1642 was substantially the same as that enunciated by the baronial party in the thirteenth century . For four hundred years after Edward I 's reign there would be no fundamental change in constitutional ideas . The debate would be concerned with practical implementation of the doctrine of the king 's two bodies , his personal and public capacities , with the institutional forms the idea ought to take . There is , after all , only one classic issue at the core of all English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does the law benefit ? It is not surprising that the course of events in the seventeenth century  | should look like a replay of those of the thirteenth . In each era violence is long brewing , and the clash is finally evoked by the ineptitude of the king and the pressure of a financial crisis . Each series of events is conditioned by questions of involvement in the European power struggle , and in each case a king at the end of his financial rope is forced to summon the community of the realm . Once called , of course , those who believe they represent the community demand control of the king 's government . They , in turn , find themselves pressed by other groups in society : in the seventeenth century by the lesser gentry and radical democrats ; in the thirteenth by the upper gentry who want the law to serve their interests as well as the barons ' . The central issue in both eras is the law . The thirteenth-century conflicts are set firmly in the feudal context ; those of the seventeenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its fullest bloom . The cry of the gently in the thirteenth century was that free tenement shall be protected ; they demanded that all cases concerning freehold must proceed by writ . The slogan " liberty and property " was simply seventeenthcentury language for the very same principle .  | I. The Disintegration of Society and Government THE FOURTEENTH and fifteenth centuries are the terra incognita of English history . We know less about the course of political and social change during these centuries than for any other era of English history after 1066 . Victorian historians ? following the suggestion of sixteenth-century writers ? viewed the years from the death of Edward I in 1307 to the accession of Henry VII Tudor in 1485 as one period , distinguished by the decline and , at times , virtual collapse of royal power in the face of a resurgent aristocracy . The consensus among scholars today is that the resurgence of royal power began not in 1485 but in 1471 when the Yorkist king Edward IV finally overcame the opposing Lancastrian faction and secured control of the central government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamentally altered the Victorian evaluation of the significance of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries in English history . It can be said at the outset that the period from 1307 to 1471 is a confusing time , if only because we know very little about what happened . The source materials for the study of the period are voluminous and , to a great extent , still unpublished . ' lucre are literally thousands of  | terribly hard-to-read manuscripts that scholars shrink from studying . They have good reasons . The English government bureaus and the law courts of the late Middle Ages were understaffed ; there simply were not enough secretaries , and the handwriting of the overworked scribes is frequently close to being undecipherable . The documents themselves are more often than not written in a kind of legal French ( which does not merit the designation of any known language ) that has no obvious logic or grammar ; nor is there any guide or handbook to it . Scholars are not eager to plunge into all this . And even if all the documents were Xeroxed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can not call them the height of the Middle Ages , nor are they the beginning of the modern world . Like legal French itself , this is a kind of bastard age . Certainly it has been an historical stepchild . Few historians are drawn to it ? no one wishes he had been born then and , except for a few fanatical genealogists , its appeal is very limited . It is even hard to know , amid all the disorder and confusion , what is important and should he studied . And it is unsurprising that no attempt to sketch a general portrait of this disturbed period has been entirely satisfactory . One great handicap is the inadequacy , beginning late in the thirteenth century , of the chroniclers . They are fewer , less energetic , duller , less reliable and informative ? a weakness that in itself signifies the general decline of the monastic orders . There are simply no contemporary narratives on which to build a coherent structure . The fifteenth century is even more arid than the fourteenth . There is only Froissart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream world , where Freudian analysis is perhaps more appropriate than anything else . From William Stubbs to the most recent historians of late medieval England , those scholars who try to give us a general view of the period have encountered insuperable difficulty in bringing the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries into clear focus . Nearly all seem to be overwhelmed and numbed by the complexity of events and vastness of the material . It even seems to be impossible to straighten out the incredibly involved genealogy of the contending Lancastrian and Yorkist royal houses . The third volume of Stubbs 's Constitutional History , which deals with the period from 1307 to 1485 , is in many ways a remarkable study , still very much worth reading , but it is the least appreciated part of his work . Stubbs found the kings of the period incompetent and the contending aristocratic factions viciously shortsighted . During these two centuries he sees England suffocating in a cloud of gloom and doom . But in his inT H E E N G L I S H  | domitably optimistic teleological manner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal failure and social disaster . Parliament ? and in particular the House of Commons ? became so centrally fixed in the process of government and law that even the despotically inclined Tudors could not do without it . Furthermore , Stubbs perceived a proto-modern constitutionalism under the Lancastrian monarchy of the fifteenth century ? an ill-defined but nevertheless real sense of the need of royal government to be responsible to Parliament . Twentiethcentury scholars like J. E. Neale have had a fine time attacking Stubbs for his anachronistic interpretation , while ignoring the caution with which the great bishop put forward his view of the Lancastrian constitution . Also , the deeper we look into late medieval thought , the less prepared are we to say that an idea of the sovereignty of Parliament was necessarily beyond the world view of fourteenth- and fifteenth-century men . Although Stubbs 's delineation of the proto-constitutionalism of the late middle ages was strongly inspired by his organic , evolutionary view of institutional development , he may have been right on this specific point , although perhaps for the wrong reason . The idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feverish atmosphere of the late medieval period . More difficult concepts , such as the law of falling bodies in physics , certainly did appear . The best general history of late medieval England is A. R. Myers ' volume in the Pelican series ; it is a thoroughly competent and in many ways subtle account , but the limitation of space and perhaps the author 's native caution make him shrink from dealing with the more difficult major problems of historical change . George Holmes 's one-volume history of the period is more perceptive and bold on social change but not as valuable as Myers on political and legal institutions . The attempt at a synoptic view of the Lancastrians and Yorkists made by S. B. Chrimes ( whose English Constitutional Ideas in the Fifteenth Century is an important , if rather old-fashioned study in political thought ) succeeds at least in establishing that the glamorous phrase " Wars of the Roses " was invented by Sir Walter Scott . The two pertinent books in the erratic Oxford series present a disconcerting contrast . May McKisack , who wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to produce a text for freshmen , while E. F. Jacob , writing on the fifteenth century , was apparently under the delusion that he was communing with the British Academy . Miss McKisack 's book is lucid and illmninating , but tends to be simple- minded . She avoids many important problems , shies away from economics , is quite good on Parliament and law , but not on religion or intellectual life , which she neglects to place within their social context . Jacob 's account simply sinks in a welter of names . We are given a parade of earls and dukes , each of whom is bound to have ? at one time or another ? three different titles . Since Jacob does not usually bother to differentiate them , the work has a kind of Proustian ambiguity ? charming enough , but rather discouraging if we care about historical understanding . Bertie Wilkinson 's writings on the fifteenth century are , as usual , Stubbs in modern dress . T. F. Tout 's detailed studies of fourteenth-century royal administration arc highly illuminating ; they suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medieval English government in the context of the comparative history of European bureaucracy . If Tout had transcribed a few less household accounts and had spent a few hours reading Max Weber instead , his work would now seem more valuable . K. B. McFarlane , of Oxford , possessed the keenest mind at work on late medieval England . His little book on John Wyclif tells us more in 250 pages about late-fourteenth-century thought , religion , and education than all the other ponderous works of Wyclif scholarship combined . But McFarlane suffered from reticence and an intense reluctance to share his knowledge and insights . He produced four or five great articles on fifteenth-century social politics , and the people who were lucky enough to hear them tell us that his Ford lectures , given several years ago at Oxford , were absolutely brilliant . But he did not see fit to publish them , and the rest of us must remain ignorant . A. R. Steel 's sensitive biography of Richard II contains some psychological analysis , which the subject cries out for . The hardest thing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that things really do change . A recent popular and widely applauded approach in English historiography has been to assume that life is static ? t his is known as Namierism . But this viewpoint is particularly wrong for the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries . For two hundred years there was chronic instability ; change was vast , enveloping , and inescapable . Wherever we look are panic , brutality , violence in the streets . This is an upsidedown world ; a troubled , feverish world . Institutional historians who never look at what happens outside Parliament and the law courts are blinded by their narrow vision ; within its limited compass things can appear unchanged , neat and calm ( although even in these areas fundamental change was taking place ) . " The world is right wild , " writes a T H E E N G L I S H  | gentleman of the mid-fifteenth century . Even the most superficial account of the history of great aristocrats is a record of conflict , treachery , killing , beheading , and murder ? even the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underneath this surface lies a general dissatisfaction and unhappiness , and a tremendous yearning . This is the great age of English mysticism ? in fact the great age of European mysticism . ' We sec it in the Low Countries and Germany and France as well . Often it takes mad and frenzied forms . People were sickened by the world they lived in ; they tried desperately to escape from it . The extreme methods of escape that men resorted to tell us how unbearable they must have found their lives . The most illuminating book on the fourteenth century is Morton Bloomfield 's study of Piers Plowman , which comes to grips with the prevailing apocalyptic feeling ? the deep and haunting belief that the world is coming to an end . It must often have seemed that way . The world was shaken and disturbed ? there was no aspect of life that offered peace or serenity . We can attempt to characterize these disturbances . They are all the things we noticed in the thirteenth century intensified . Then they were vague tensions and currents that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden , they burst through the surface , and now the disturbances ? in economic , political , social and religious life ? are obvious and shattering . The catastrophic effects of the Black Death that swept away twenty to forty percent of the population of Europe , including England 's , in the 1340 's iS well known . But the economic problems were already becoming apparent in the last quarter of the thirteenth century . The grave and general problems that bedeviled the medieval economy were first perceived by the German economic historian , W. Abel , who discovered widespread depopulation in Germany at the end of the thirteenth century . This investigation was taken up by the English scholar M. M. Postan who , while studying the estates of the Bishop of Winchester , had observed the same phenomenon in England . Postan concluded that the population decline set in late in the thirteenth and early in the fourteenth centuries and that the Black Death merely accelerated what was already a marked trend . We also know , from studying fourteenth- and fifteenth-century trade records , that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant a marked decline in the available labor supply , in the amount of land in cultivation , and in the volume of export trade . For about two decades , which seems to be the average life-span of-any  | historical interpretation , this view has prevailed , but now Postan 's thesis of a late medieval depression has been questioned . Here and there , it is true , we can find a manor where Postan 's conclusions do not obtain , but it is still hard to deny that critical and widespread economic problems existed . There is no way of evading the fact that the European economy was in serious trouble from the thirteenth century until the great upsurge of population in the eighteenth century and the onset of the Industrial Revolution . Because there was a period of great prosperity during the sixteenth century this dismal curve is often overlooked . But that boom , which was really very short-lived , was artificially induced by the flow of specie into Europe from the New World and enhanced by the opening of overseas trade and speculation . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from 1270 to 1700 , there was only one period of prosperity ? 1500 to 1580 . This is not to say that some people did not become rich . Of course there was individual wealth , but the general economy remained stagnant . The single basic flaw in the European economy was that distribution was unable to keep pace with production . The resources , ingenuity and the techniques were available , but primitive methods of communications and transportation frustrated expansion and development . New products often could not reach markets , and new mass markets could not be established . Beginning in the fourteenth century , economic difficulties lead to complaints against the government ? we can now begin to think about the interraction of economics and social politics . Since the twelfth century the crown had demanded a great deal from people . Now royal government figures prominently in everyday life , it really counts . In the days of Edward the Confessor no one noticed it very much , it barely had any impact on life . But ever since William the Conqueror ? particularly since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of landed society . And now , when landed society is in trouble , its leaders make demands on government . Thus economic problems stimulated the political breakdown and led to political instability . Inc chronic economic dislocation of the late Middle Ages presented a tremendous challenge to royal government . There were problems which demanded intelligence , energy , wisdom and moderation ? qualities with which the English kings and their administrators were skimpily endowed . These men of small talent had a much harder job than the kings of the late twelfth century ? and they were infinitely less qualified . To make things even harder , people were excited and restless . They kept T H E E N G L I S H  | close watch on government ; blunders would not go unnoticed ? and the kings were always making mistakes . Economic circumstances produced important changes in the structure of rural society . No one has carefully worked it out , but the drop in population is astounding . In the thirteenth century population had grown enormously ? in 1300 there may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many as during the reign of Elizabeth I ) . But from 1290 to 1390 population fell by at least thirty percent ? a decline for which the bubonic plague was not entirely responsible . These statistics , uncertain as they may be , are worrisome and problematic . Demography is still a mysterious science , and the causes of population decline are still obscure and usually inexplicable . We do know , however , how the population decline affected the landowning class . In the late thirteenth century villages were overflowing with laborers , and this is why ? in comparison with the continent ? the manumission of serfs was retarded in England . The landlords were firmly in control . It was a buyer 's market ; the landlords could be tough and unmerciful ? there was little the peasants could do to bargain for improved status . The severe labor shortage later in the fourteenth century put the peasant in a much stronger position , however , and this was the last stage in the manumission of serfs ; it marked the end of villeinage in England . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on he will be known as a copyholder ) . This does not mean that the peasants thrived particularly . Their position was still precarious , and in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries some of them were driven off the land . But they did succeed in escaping the traditional servile obligations of manorial life . Day laborers could now secure higher wages ; tenants could obtain better terms . And now the landlords who faced an alert , aggressive peasantry tried to reverse this process ? they resorted to parliamentary statute in an effort to control and curb the peasantry . One of the immediate causes of the 1381 peasant revolt was this attempt to freeze wages . But peasant activity could not be stopped . The huge and terrible explosion in 1381 set the king and government to shaking in their boots , and if the peasants had not happened to believe that Richard II was their savior , they might have indulged in wholesale landlord slaughter . ( They did kill the Archbishop of Canterbury , who happened to be a notoriously exploitative landlord . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasant is lifting his head and looking around . He is gaining consciousness ? of his place in society , and of himself as a person .  | It is a modern commonplace that social revolution never occurs until conditions have already improved to some extent , that people need to be aware of opportunities before they can even think to reach out to seize them . This is the phenomenon we call the revolution of rising expectations ? and we can see it happening in the fourteenth century . An important transformation in rural social structure brought a new pressure to bear on the landlord class . We can assume that the smaller landlord was very hard pressed on all sides ? from the population decline , from the decline in the market for his grain , and from an alert , intransigent and , at times , highly organized peasantry . And the gentry , who did not understand their predicament , who tried , often desperately , to cope with the new and bewildering economic circumstances , were to find war very attractive . Hard-pressed and frustrated knights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and escape ? to fight and pillage on the continent in the Hundred Years ' War . One could still beat up peasants in France . The fourteenth and fifteenth centuries also saw a further polarization in the baronial class . A few great lords are growing richer and richer ; others , whose grandfathers were prosperous enough in the thirteenth century , are now struggling to keep up . But nothing stands in the way of the great lords ? men who dominate and , sometimes literally own , whole counties . They operate on a bigger margin , and they continue to prosper in the face of spreading misery . About half of these people have royal blood , and they can compensate for hard times by pillaging the crown . Economic problems do not bother these men ? in fact they probably benefit from them . By the last decade of the fourteenth century there are ten dukes and a dozen earls ; they stand out as a separate caste . And , as members of that caste , they pursue a very special occupation . They fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At any one time they comprise no more than twenty-five or thirty people , they can have everything in the world : wealth , intellect , learning , culture ? anything money and position can secure is theirs . The only thing left was t he crown itself , and more of the crown 's property . Between 1370 and 1 470 they fought for these things ? the result was anarchy and utter chaos . The same thing was happening in France as well , where an unrewitting struggle among the princes for control of the French crown was decimating the country . Great aristocratic conflict is a general aspect of later medieval European society . The most perceptive book on the subject is Johan Huizinga 's Waning of the Middle Ages , which , although it is specifically concerned with the situation in the Low Countries , tells T H E E N G L I S H  | us , more than any supposedly relevant work does , what things were like in late medieval England . All wealth and power was vested in a small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a formal work of art . They lived in a dream world , where life becomes stylized choreography . The trouble is that they have a real impact on the world outside ; because of the intricacies of their fantasy world , blood is shed . For them , however , it is all nothing but play ? a self-conscious drama that they gracefully enact . This is how Huizinga describes the Burgundian court , and it was like this in fourteenth-and fifteenth-century England , too . These people , acting out their esthetic attitude toward life , are totally irresponsible . Every action is some kind of posture , the striking of an attitude . Everything is given a special ritual quality . Even executions are ritualized . It is hard to account for this . Perhaps it is symptomatic of the last , decadent stages of a civilization ; certainly it is the result of a loss of vitality , the death of an ideal . Nothing is left but empty and meaningless form . If we believe that civilizations are organisms , this is the only possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has properly evaluated its social significance . The whole aristocratic ethos , with its concept of gentility , its knighthood , its tournaments , is more important than modern scholars generally think . The last , extravagant flowering of chivalry is , perhaps , a response to the emergence of the bourgeoisie . The aristocrats are not the only people who can have property now ; other people have money and wealth , they can even fight . The aristocratic ethos , which first appeared in the twelfth century , now reaches its ultimate expression . The power and privileges of great lords depend on their qualities as superior people . Anyone can get money , but only aristocrats can be born right . More and more this becomes an inflexible ideology ? a dogma . Nothing else matters to these men . Their ideology plays a crucial role in the peculiar conduct of the English and French nobility in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries . The only thing they think about is their exclusive chivalric circle ? the world was a hothouse where they cultivated their code . Everything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wealth , great thinkers , piety , devotion ; but these things have no effect . It might have been amusing and harmless , like the petty courts of eighteenth-century Germany , except that these people also held real power . Chivalry is deadly . The welfare of states with vast economic and human resources was wrecked and torn to pieces by these great people at play . What they did in their fantasy world really did The Waning of the Medieval Order ? 13o7 to 1471  | matter . Everything in society was employed in the pursuit of their fantasies , in their courtly ritual , in the great aristocratic tournament they made of life . Under William the Conqueror and Henry II this could never have happened . These kings were too rational , too much in touch with reality . They were able to exploit the aristocratic code ( Henry II was particularly skillful here ) , yet remain apart from it . But in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the monarchy itself is absorbed into the high aristocratic ethos . And kingship suffers . Kings no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible exception of Richard II , who was anomalous in many ways and had to be deposed , all the kings succumbed . The aristocratic ethos takes over the king , the court , and the government . Finally the crown itself is seen as nothing but the grand prize in a courtly game . This is what the misnamed Wars of the Roses is all about . The idea of the dignity of the crown and the sense of the state , which had been vital in the thirteenth century , all but vanishes in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries . The English kings now endow their sons and brothers : they make them dukes and grant them vast holdings . Edward I initiated the practice , but with Edward III in the mid-fourteenth century it becomes really significant . The problems of kingship are now compounded ; the endowment of princes and the creation of resplendent titles symbolized the blurring of the distinction between monarchy and aristocracy . By naming his second son duke of Lancaster , the king in effect makes the aristocracy royal . No longer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barons . The sense of distance , of cleavage , has gone . By 1370 the great barons are the royal family , the kings have been swallowed up by the courtly , aristocratic world . No longer can there be a struggle between the king ? supported by his ministers , judges and administrators ? and the great barons . This division had been fundamental in England from io66 to 1307 ; it had served a healthy social purpose , and its disappearance in the fourteenth century was a disaster . Government was no longer able to rule the aristocracy . The force that the AngloNorman and Angevin monarchs countered and controlled now overwhelms the monarchy . Government itself is tossed about in accordance with the outcome of what are , in effect , feuds within the royal family . These conflicts will wreck government and tear apart society . The intellectual and religious upheaval of fourteenth-century England contributed as much as economic and political change to the waning of T H E E N G L I S H  | the medieval order . Not again until the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading role in European thought . In the first quarter of the fourteenth century while the royal government is beginning to falter and the onset of the great depression is causing dismay and anguish in society , Oxford is the intellectual capital of Europe . It was the Oxford Franciscans Duns Scotus and William of Ockham who brought about a revolution in European thought . Duns Scotus was the greatest of medieval logicians ; the tendency of his doctrine is very like the radical empiricism of that other Scottish genius , David Hume . William of Ockham went even further than Duns in separating the world of reason and the world of faith , thereby undermining the Thomist synthesis and exercising an enormous impact on late medieval thinking . Ockham argued that the mind can establish general propositions only about the world of nature but not about God , who can be known only intuitively , by direct religious experience . Ockham thereby encouraged scholars at Merton College , Oxford , to improve upon the scientific work of Robert Grosseteste and Roger Bacon and achieve significant breakthroughs toward establishing general laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ockham also encouraged the proliferation of mysticism in fourteenth-century England . He himself became steadily more anti-orthodox in his thinking . First he claimed that a general council of the church can overrule the Pope and then that individual conscience was the only test of faith . Not surprisingly , Ockham was excommunicated by Rome , and died in exile at the court of the German emperor , where he occupied himself by turning out anti-papal pamphlets . Radical as Ockham was , and as wide as his influence spread ( Luther was to proclaim himself an Occamist ) , the arch-heretic of the fourteenth century was another distinguished Oxford professor , John Wyclif . Every idea that can be found in sixteenth-century radical Protestantism can also be found in Wyclif , who was teaching in the third quarter of the fourteenth century . Wyclif was fiercely anti-sacerdotal and anti-sacramental ; he did not even believe in transubstantiation ? an incredibly radical position at the time . Laymen , he said , had the right to seize the property of the church . It was this belief that enabled Wyclif @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in favor of seizing church property ? there was already a long and respectable tradition of that ? and John of Gaunt , Duke of Lancaster , who controlled the royal The Waning of the Medieval Order ? 13o7 to 1471  | administration in the 136o 's and 137o 's , was not about to burn a man who preached such sound doctrine . Wyclif evoked a tremendous popular response and found his most aggressive disciples in the heretical wandering preachers , the Lollards . In the fourteenth century the English church is losing control over popular piety . Though the secular clergy detested them , the Franciscans had salvaged the church 's authority in the thirteenth century . But something had gone wrong with the Franciscan order ; it split apart , and some of its members ( Ockham among them ) were branded by the Pope as heretics . The demand for teaching , truth , and divine light remained ; to fill it there were only the popular preachers ? friars , renegade friars , and the openly heretical Lollards . This was a spontaneous response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense ; all around them men saw economic misery , political upheaval , the murder of kings . Someone was needed to explain and justify it . This accounts for the great upsurge of revivalism , of millennial , apocalyptic , puritanical religion . Inflammatory sermons were being preached all over England ; an amazing number of them were written down and preserved . ( Many have been published by the Early English Text Society , and they have been well studied by G. R. Owst . ) Some of them strike notes we will hear again in the sixteenth and seventeenth century , and the question inevitably arises whether there was a continuity of puritanical , experiential religion ; whether popular piety took root and remained important . The consensus of scholarship today is to see a direct continuity from fourteenth-century Lollardry to sixteenth-century radical Protestantism . In any case , fourteenth-century English piety tended to be contemptuous of the papacy , and it was sometimes openly heretical . Sometimes social democracy was preached ? the idea that all men are equal before God . It was no coincidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Lollard . The peasants murdered the Archbishop of Canterbury not only because they hated landlords , but also because some of them were intensely anti-sarcerdotal as well . Fourteenth-century England was the seedbed of European heresy ; English heresy may even have given rise to the Hussite movement in central Europe , though this connection , plausible enough , is also very hazy . Early in the fifteenth century , the royal government became very frightened , and launched a full-scale inquisition which revealed , to their shock and amazement , that heresy was not just an aberration found T H E E N G L I S H  | among peasants . Gentlemen like Sir John Oldcastle ? the model for Shakespeare 's Sir John Falstaff ? were deeply involved as well . We can not yet be sure if Lollardry was destroyed , or merely forced underground . Nineteenth-century historians were sure there was a continuous Protestant stream in England from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century . This meant , of course , that the Reformation was not just an authoritarian scheme inspired by Henry VIII 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there may be a good deal of truth in it . Religious upheaval in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries is enmeshed with the other kinds of disturbance we have noted ; in many ways it is a response to them . The lines of authority and leadership collapsed on all but the most local level . With a vacuum at the center , when the church , and government as well , were disintegrating , security could only be found under the protection of the local magnate . Only through maintenance and livery , by putting on the badge of the local duke and getting the magnate 's support in the law court , could a man secure his person and his property . This is what we mean by bastard feudalism ? a real retrogression to a primitive form of social organization . It was a natural response to what was virtually abdication by the traditional leaders of English society ? the church and the king . The church suffered from special problems that made its leadership ineffective . No one was even sure who the Pope was . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Englishmen rejected the authority of both . Kingship had special problems as well . An incredible array of incompetent men took their places on the English throne during this period . First there was Edward II ( 1307-1327 ) , the most repulsive king until George I. An unattractive homosexual , whose French wife took up with a Welsh lord after the king had revealed his affection for various unsavory courtiers , Edward was finally forced to abdicate and was then murdered by his queen and her lover . Edward III ( 1327-1377 ) was only slightly more appealing . Not very strong-minded , he was the sort of man who should have been given some wooden soldiers and locked up in a castle . Edward was very dim ; he really loved the chivalric idea of warfare and adored to go marching off to battle in France with his pretty army behind him , pennants waving and trumpets blaring . Games enchanted him and he insisted on playing them . But they were very costly games . It cost 50,000 pounds just to mount one French expedition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time Edward had the pleasure of riding at the head of his army it put lint I2,000 pounds  | deeper in debt . Edward had to live on loans from Italian bankers ? he even farmed the English customs to them , and finally he defaulted on his debts ? not a very kingly thing to do . Edward did manage to win glorious battles , but they never seemed to mean anything . He did kill thousands of French peasants and once he captured the French king , who happened to be even less intelligent than Edward , a distinction of ' some kind . Edward 's son , the romantic Black Prince , was a great national hero ; he was indeed a magnificent warrior but also a vicious sadist . Finally , in the 1370 'S , Edward III lay slowly dying of venereal disease while his sons and grandsons squabbled over the crown . Richard II ( 1377-1399 ) , the Black Prince 's son , who got it , did have some notion of what kingship was all about ? the Shakespeare portrait of him is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many enemies ? everyone seemed to line up against him . That Richard was a homosexual , and probably psychotic as well , did not help him to win friends . Richard lost his throne to his shrewd Lancastrian cousin , Henry Bolingbroke . Henry IV ( 1399-1413 ) was a mysterious king . Perhaps there is a good deal of the Renaissance monarch in him ; a crafty , intelligent man , lie might have been capable of reviving the monarchy while playing on and destroying the aristocracy . But he climbed onto the throne with the liclp of an aristocratic faction ; hence he was obligated to them and , seated so unsteadily on the throne , he could never overcome the insecurity of his dubious title . Henry V ( 1413-1422 ) takes us back to Edward III . Shakespeare and Laurence Olivier were all wrong about Henry V. He happened to win the battle of Agincourt because the French knights were stupid enough to charge across a plowed field right after a rainstorm where , mired in the mud , the famous English yeomen could hardly miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the process of swallowing France ? not a very sensible thing to want to do ? when he died . Henry VI ( 1422-1461 ) was a combination of Henry III and Edward III . Another gentle man , he had excellent taste in art , built a beautiful college at Cambridge , and went mad . As Henry 's insanity became apparent , the English were expelled from nearly all of their French territories , while the crown went up for grabs ? and for twenty years the Lancastrian and Yorkist factions in the aristocracy hacked away at each other to get it . No one knows exactly what this meant to society . Certainly there were great disturbances , at least among the landed class , and these exacerbated the breakdown of government and law , which had barely functioned for a long time anyway . Grim and unequivocal records of vioT H E E N G L I S H   lence confront us at every hand . A petition to the king inscribed on the Parliament rolls for 1459 says that complaints are universal throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppressions , riots , unlawful assemblies , wrongful imprisonments . " Even worse , the " misdoers be so favored and assisted by persons of great might , which in riotous and forcible manner disturb and hinder . . . your Justices of Assize and Peace in every part of this your realm , that no execution of your law may be had . " And there was no redress " as your said true subjects ... for fear and doubt of their lives , neither complain to your Highness , nor sue for remedy after the course of your laws , but rather . . . suffer such wrongs without remedy . " Finally , in 1461 , the Yorkist leader Edward IV gained the throne . Edward represented a healthy change from the rulers of the previous 150 years . I-le was tough and austere , and he believed in the dignity of kingship . He was so little shackled to the idea of chivalry that he married a commoner ? for which he was never forgiven by the aristocracy . It was not until 1471 that Edward was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully to the reconstruction of royal government and law . From this year we can date the beginning of the resurgence of English monarchy . But it was a reconstruction that had to cope with the ravages left by the upheavals of the previous century and a half and to build upon the institutional changes that were coming about during the late medieval period . II . The Institutional Legacy of the Late Middle Ages THE RAMBLINGS of Sir John Fortescue , chief justice of the king 's bench who died in 1476 , have given him a grand reputation . His celebrated treatises on English government and law have been carefully studied for centuries ; in our own they have been hailed as examples of Renaissance political thought . This is a curious judgment , since Fortescue was not exactly the brightest or most subtle theorist ever to write a disquisition on law and politics . Still , he does deserve serious attention . Fortescue 's writings are interesting , not because he is particularly brilliant or profound ( rather lie tends to be superficial and unreflective ) ,  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude of the welleducated gentleman who also happens to hold an important legal place in fifteenth-century England . What is finally most intriguing about Fortescue 's work is the ambivalence ? never quite resolved ? that lies at the core of his thought . There are two things Fortescue says , and he is compelled to say them over and over again . The first is that English institutions and customs are the best in the world . In their prosperity , felicity and virtue , the English put everyone else , particularly the benighted French , to shame and , as far as Fortescue is concerned , this happy English condition is a direct consequence of the superior quality of English political and legal institutions . His writing is sustained throughout by a smug and blatant nationalism . The second theme is his definition of the nature of the constitution . Here Fortescue owes , as do all serious political theorists , a large debt to Aristotle . There are two kinds of government , he tells us , regal government ( dominium regale ) and political government ( dominium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutist , irresponsible monarchy , something more or less on the order of what the unfortunate French boors have to suffer . By political government , he means government by consent , government that takes account of the community , government in which the king can not alter the laws without the consent of his subjects . As a Lancastrian supporter , Fortescue staunchly believes in the idea of consent ( the Lancastrians were , admittedly , not powerful enough to rule without Parliament , hence they had little choice ) . At bottom , however , he is not irrevocably committed to government by consent . At times of crisis the king , he allows , must take the law into his own hands and rule by his own will . Even in England , the monarchy does at times rule , and ought to rule , without the consent of the political nation . These two ideas are worth pursuing . They will lead us to compare government in England and the continent during the fifteenth century and to analyze the tension between responsible and irresponsible monarchy that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century . Nineteenth-century historians were too prone to make sweeping and less than tactful generalizations about national character . They expounded national stereotypes , were inclined to rhapsodize over mystical aspects of Volksgeist , and generally engage in the kind of ethnic history that modern scholars ( who usually prefer to use some other jargon ) mercilessly sneer at . Nevertheless , there is something to be T H E E N G L I S H  | said for the nineteenth-century treatment of nationality and national characteristics . Once we admit that the areas of western Europe do exhibit national peculiarities , we can see that these have , to a large degree , pretty much jelled by the end of the fifteenth century . Perhaps the best way to make sense of national character is to inquire what are the various pastimes , concerns and attitudes of fifteenth-century European peoples . The French concern themselves with monarchy , gloire , and sport a flamboyant , noisy , but ineffective aristocracy . This persisted in French history down to 1789 and to some degree to the present . France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation of the monarchy ; kings shaped and unified it and in medieval Europe France was a " continental " country , rather like the United States . One government embraces , often uncomfortably , areas that are vastly divergent . Northern France is little like southern France , and the two parts have scarcely any natural relation to one another . As a country , France was one huge political construction . Frenchmen are apparently happy only when a strong monarchy gives them an aura of glory and a sense of national purpose ; otherwise they sulk , relinquish their external notion of nationality , and go back to regional differences . Germany , by the end of the fifteenth century , had also fulfilled its national character , though it is hard to say in what this consists . It appears to be an odd combination of childish enthusiasm and very high seriousness ? an amalgam that leads to hard work , clean streets , and the pursuit of devils . It is an important clue to German history to recognize that since the middle ages the German soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Italians , by 1500 , had sunk into their characteristic attitude of privatism . Underneath a surface fire and idealism , Italians are the coolest , most realistic people in Europe . Italians believe in nothing but family , which is why they can afford to be so flowery when they speak about the state . Politics for them is merely a game , a luxury , an amoral sport ; the only things that really count are family , sex and food . We can hardly blame them for cultivating an attitude of disengagement . Since the fifth century , Italy has been the battleground for everyone else in Europe ; for a millennium foreign troops have been marching up and down the peninsula . Spain is the most mysterious country , and Spaniards the most mysterious people in Europe.They seem to be great activists , but all they really believe in is the moment . Thus they are the great existentialists of Europe . This is why  | they are able to be so pious ? they never stop to contemplate the significance of their piety . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theologian . The kind of world view that exalts the significance of the moment produces great saints , street-fighters , dancers and artists , but no great statesmen or thinkers . The great national characteristic of the English is a devotion to government , law , and evangelical religion , traits that are already very clear in the late fifteenth century . In spite of the myth issuing from England 's lead in the Industrial Revolution , Englishmen were never notable European businessmen . The coming of the Industrial Revolution to England before any other country was an accident , a lucky combination of factors necessary for industrial take-off , as historians and economists are just beginning to fully understand . Today it is commonly acknowledged that the English are not effective as businessmen . Their economic triumph was short-lived . Now that the temporary supremacy enjoyed by Englishmen because the Industrial Revolution happened to take place first in their country has vanished , we can see how the whole business adventure was a transient thing . Dramatic events often lead historians badly astray , and nothing has lured them down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Historiographically , everything has been organized around the rise of the English bourgeoisie and the empire , but this has only served to cramp our thinking about what forces really make English history go . In law , government , and religion the English have excelled , and in these areas the great tensions of English history are generated ; here will be found the spring that makes English history run . One of the most important themes in English history is the tension between central government , law and religion and local law , government and religion . ( To describe this as conflict between king and community is just a fancy way of saying the same thing . ) At any rate , this tension already existed in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries ; by then the problems and issues of the next two hundred years are formulated , though they are still obscure . Once we apprehend this , it becomes obvious that 1485 is a meaningless date , 1471 not much more significant , and that the four centuries after 1300 must be seen as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is more sensible to begin at the local level , and we will ask how political authority is wielded in the English countryside . The familiar figure of the justice of the peace goes back to the middle of the thirteenth century . During the barons ' war of the 1260 's a local T H E E N G L I S H  | official called the keeper of the peace appeared . He was a prominent country gentleman appointed , in disturbed times , to assist the sheriff in maintaining law and order in the county . Between the four yearly appearances of the justices in tyre , the sheriff was the only local embodiment of royal authority , and it was plain that he could not cope with things by himself . The justices of the peace relished their tasks ; it was a way to win social recognition , as well as legal and political influence . About one hundred years later , in the 136o 's , their office was formalized and enhanced when they took over many of the administrative chores that had previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society becomes more hostile to the activities of the justices in eyre , the office of the justice of the peace grows more important . The general eyre had become very unpopular ; it was the scene of too many embarrassing revelations , and the inquisitiveness of the king 's judicial representatives met with more and more obstinacy on the part of the country gentry . During the reign of Edward I we see the general eyre passing out of existence . After 1330 there were no justices in eyre at all . By the fifteenth century , all the administrative functions , as well as many of the judicial functions , of the itinerant justices are in the hands of the J.P . ' s . In each county , the J.P . ' s meet in quarter session ; they sit in judgment on the greater share of the legal business of the shire ; they are now the men who implement the day-to-day workings of the common law . The justices of assize only pass through the county once or twice a year . They have time only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of great legal complications , or with felonies involving men of substance and influence . But all ordinary cases are tried at the quarter sessions , where the J.P . ' s preside , a practice that will continue until the nineteenth century . What were the administrative tasks of the J.P . ' s ? They conducted investigations into property belonging to the crown , they assessed taxes and collected them . They were , for all practical purposes , the government . This was a tremendous legal and , in some ways , a social revolution , though it was accomplished without any fireworks . Historians who are set quivering by the rise of the gentry in the sixteenth century should take another hard look at the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries . The first statute of the game law system dates from 1390 ? and the game laws were the institutional guarantee that the gentry class could indulge in its favorite pastime without interference from those who were merely hungry . It was laid clown in 1390 that only men whose income from land was at least 40 shillings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Order ? i3o7 to 471  | dogs , and kill deer and rabbits . By 400 the country gentry had already absorbed much of the royal authority . Government was sloughing off more and more of its work on the community of the shire . It always had sought to use the community of the shire in the interests of royal power and authority , and it still does , but now there is a significant difference . Never before had government had to hand over any real power to the gentry . The local gentlemen served on juries , but juries were instruments of the royal judges who controlled them . Now the gentry do the work and have the power ; in law and administration , the community of the shire virtually governs itself . The power of the local gentry has become enormous . Why should this have happened ? The gentry had always exerted pressure for substantial rewards ; they had long been bent on seizing power as well as responsibility , but under a strong monarchy they had been frustrated . What makes the difference is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal government . What happened in the Angevin period has been checked and reversed . A slack and incompetent royal government finds governing the shires too difficult and expensive , and so it lets them govern themselves . The new pattern of authority and jurisdiction is tenacious ; it will be maintained until the second half of the nineteenth century . We must remember , though , that while the authority of the central government has receded , the government itself has by no means vanished . Rather we should think of English administrat ion in the fifteenth century in terms of duality , and recognize two forces at work . They are bound to operate in different directions and they will inevitably lead to tensions and contradictions in government ? tensions t hat could , however , be glossed over for several hundred years . While there were innovations outside the established administrative structure , a new legal procedure that operated outside the traditional framework of the common law was appearing . The idea of equity , which is the justification for the judicial proceedings in the king 's chancery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will develop . The common law contains no idea of equity . The aim of the common law is to give every man his due , to maintain society as it exists , to preserve whatever belongs to a man in law , what he owns as the member of a group which has certain established privileges . But Roman law , which is structured around principles of abstract justice , says that the law should control society in conformity with the law of nature , with some sort of abstract , higher law . It equates law with justice . The notion of equity T H E E N G L I S H  | was not completely new in England . Henry II 's clerics could be quite eloquent on the subject ; still , the common law acknowledged no procedure for arriving at equitable decisions . In equity , a judge must be able to go above the law , to bypass due process , to appeal to a higher , sovereign authority . Henry II 's justices may have been fully cognizant of the idea , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mid-fourteenth century , addressed to the chancellor , that we see the beginnings of equity procedure . The petitions arc informed by a conviction that the common law ? at least in a particular case ? does not give justice . Why do men put their troubles before the chancellor ? They are really appealing directly to the king , to the highest authority in the land , to the fount of justice , and the chancellor is the administrative embodiment of the conscience of the king . Technically , a writ out of chancery can redress the inequitable outcome of a case that either can not be dealt with in the common law courts , or has been treated in a manifestly unjust manner . When it becomes apparent in a specific case that a particular common law rule needs to be broken , equity procedure is the way to do it . But equity also contains a threat ; equity procedure can be used as an authoritarian tool by the crown . Later this would be seen as a serious problem . For who can dispute the chancellor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a roguish thing , " complains the seventeenth-century common lawyer John Selden . " For Law we have a measure , know what to trust to ; Equity is according to the conscience of the Chancellor , and as that is larger or narrower , so is Equity . ' T is all one as if they should make the standard for the measure we call a foot ' a Chancellor 's foot ; what an uncertain measure would this be ! " But in the fifteenth century equity procedure represented a vast improvement over the common law , and men were not yet ready to worry that it might , in the hands of a despotically inclined ruler , be used to subvert and destroy the common law itself . Rather , equity is a safety valve that allows the rigid and ponderous common law to keep functioning while its general structure remains unchanged . For the common law is even slower and more cumbersome than it had ever been . There is a certain irony about this . Under Henry II English law worked in an extremely quick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything must be put in writing and then studied , a case is likely to drag on for more time . Justice under Henry II was , no doubt , sometimes rough and ready ; it was not very probing or subtle , but it was speedy . The most notable characteristic of the common law in the fourThe Waning of the Medieval Order ? 1307 to 1471  | teenth century , however , was sluggishness ? a quality that is still fundamental in the eighteenth century . Why was law so slow and unwieldy ? First , it was uncodified . In many cases it was hard even to know what the law prescribed . Obscurity did not discourage chicanery on the part of fee-hungry attorneys , and it did lead to much fumbling and uncertainty . It fostered the development of devious schemes to circumvent the obstacles that were impossible to remove . The major function of an attorney in the common law is to see that a case never comes to trial , and the English attorney was , by the fourteenth century , extremely skilled at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was entitled to three excuses ( called essoins ) before he was forced to come into court ; thus at least a year and a half would go by before a case even came to trial . At this point , a special plea , which turned on the validity of the writ , could be invoked . This sort of prevarication could go on for years . The very nature of the law was slow and unwieldy , and the qualities built into the common law structure were compounded by the greed and selfishness of the legal profession . The other thing that undermined the law was violence . The technical words for this form of subversion are livery and maintenance and , though the words have far-reaching implications , they may be strictly defined . Livery means to wear a uniform , like a liveried servant . But it was not necessary to put on the whole uniform ; a badge would suffice to show that you belonged to a group that enjoyed the patronage of a powerful lord . To wear livery means to belong to a gang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patron who retains you ; it means that in return for your loyalty he will bring pressure to bear on your behalf . Great lords were not likely to be very delicate about making their power felt , nor were their retainers apt to be squeamish about the kind of services they were asked to perform . It was not unusual for a local lord to appear at the assizes with a great force of retainers at his back . A show of force like this was quite effective in serving its purpose , which was to overawe the court . Livery , in short , is gangsterism in the guise of aristocratic affiliation . Great lords did not hesitate to practice what we immediately recognize as lynch law . We have a description in a fifteenth-century source of the behavior of the Earl of Oxford concerning a certain Piers , a man imprisoned in the bishop 's jail at Lynn , an important town in Norfolk . " My Lord pulled him out of the . . . gaol , and made to put him upon a horse , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " we are told . " Forthwith , the . . . Bishop , the Mayor , and others of their fellowship T H E E N G L I S H  | met with my said Lord . . . and . . . Piers tied by an halter , the Bishop having these words unto my Lord with his hat in his hands . My Lord , this is a prisoner , as you may know . . . . What will you do with him ? ' Thereto my Lord said , He is my prisoner now . ' Whereto the Bishop said , Where is your warrant or commission thereto ? ' My Lord said , I have warrant sufficient for me . ' And thus they departed , the Mayor and all the Commonalty of Lynn keeping their silence . " Maintenance means something beyond mere payment . It too has a very precise technical definition . The legal sense of maintenance is any action of wrongfully aiding and abetting litigation ; it means to subvert juries and judges , to bribe , to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , means the destruction of the common law . According to Lambarde , a sixteenth-century writer , a broad definition of maintenance is " to disturb the course of the common law . " Livery and maintenance go together . A man wears the livery of a great lord , who maintains him . They are ominous words , and they represent a sinister alliance . Together they helped to ruin the common law . We can see how it was done clearly enough in the Paston letters . The Pastons were country gentry , an intelligent , substantial gentry family who lived in fifteenth-century Norfolk . Their letters are taken up to a large extent with the favorite activity of the gentry ? securing their property . But for the Pastons this occupation was particularly wearisome and unrewarding , for they invariably had a very hard time of it in the courts . It seemed that the great lord in Norfolk was against them , and they at odds with him . There was little they could do . Dismay runs through their letters and a bitter , melancholy plaint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of stories of bribery , perjury , the corrupting of judges as well as juries , and the intimidation of witnesses . The sheriff was a key official in the operation of local justice , for he was the one who empaneled the jury , yet the complicity of sheriffs in judicial corruption was widespread . Justice Yelverton prays that " we may have a good shereve and a good undershereve that neythir for good favore no fere , wol returne for the King , ne betwix partie and partie , none othir men but such as ar good and trewe , and in no wyse will be forsworne ; for the pepil here is loth to compleyne til thei here tydinges of a good shereve . " The judge 's hopes , we can readily imagine , did not soon come true . John Paston , at one point , is rash enough to indict the local lord who had attacked his manor of Gresham . The sheriff receives a letter from the king in which he is instructed to empanel a jury that will acThe Waning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice that was apparently not unusual , for Paston notes that six or eight shillings would buy such a royal letter . Thus we can easily understand why William Paston , the lawyer , advises a client to drop his suit because his opponent is befriended by the Duke of Norfolk . There was simply no point in trying to go against a man like the duke who , when he seized the Paston 's castle of Caister , was able to send a force of three thousand men to surround it . The common law , which the gentry had loved and supported , seems to be turning against them . The intervention of their aristocratic enemies is effective . The law , which had long been slow and cumbersome , is now malevolent as well . In a situation like this the only recourse is to amend procedure . Since the reign of Edward III in the mid-fourteenth century , a means of improvement had been required ; by the fifteenth century , particularly in the 1460 's and 1470 's , the need is imperative . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be supplemented expands at an astonishing rate . The new system works out of the king 's prerogative power to maintain justice and provide peace . Before the Star Chamber Act of 1487 the new courts had no statutory basis , and the procedural details were pragmatically delineated . But the new judicial form obviously issues from the royal prerogative , hence the term prerogative court . The chancellor , in the name of the king , bestows justice ; he protects people from fraud and violence ; he issues extraordinary writs to secure property . In the 1470 's the procedure was probably rather casual . The king and his ministers meet to hear petitions and give justice in cases of fraud for which there is no other remedy . Star chamber was simply a branch of the king 's council that happened to meet and deal with riots in a room with stars painted on the ceiling , whence the evocative name . The operative word for a star chamber case was riot ; the key word that bestirred the court of chancery was fraud . The men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star chamber ? are members of the king 's council . Though in theory the law works out of the king 's personal prerogative , it is universally understood that the prerogative is exercised by his ministers who , as they examine the petitions and hand down justice , are exercising power on behalf of their master . The procedure stands at the opposite extreme of what the justices of the peace do . As the office of the J.P . develops , the common law is surrendered to the gentry , to the influential men in the county . Yet at the smile time , the king is acting in a more arbitrary and immediate way . I lc is operating outside the old , established writ system and jury  | system . He is encouraged to exercise an important public function directly out of his prerogative , to correct the law , to go beyond it . It might be hard to reconcile this with the deeply held notion that the king must be below the law . Here is an important ground of potential conflict . King and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . stands for decentralization ; his new powers proclaim how far in fact decentralization has gone , but at the same time the new prerogative courts stand for a high degree of centralization ; they embody a new form of royal intervention and control . It is easy to see how the contradictions between the two arc creating a great tension within the law itself . Striking as it is , this tension is not unique . Similar strains exist in government and , to some extent , in religion as well . In government , there were two important late medieval developments and , as in law , they point in opposite directions .. First is the entrenchment of Parliament . The bill procedure is worked out and systemized . During the fourteenth century the House of Commons had begun to assume a distinct character ; now it has a speaker ; it sports all the appurtenances we are familiar with today . Men are beginning to take Parliament for granted . There is a feeling that for important things , like new taxes , parliamentary legislation is necessary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an institution where important matters concerning the nation are to be decided . Thus during the fourteenthand fifteenth-century struggles over control of the crown , Parliament was used to give an aura of legality to whichever aristocratic faction had the upper hand at a particular time . This is not to say that Parliament decided the fate of England ; rather it was a rubber stamp employed by aristocratic gangs . Still , for unglorious purposes Parliament itself was glorified . The appearance of strict legality was required , and nothing was more legal than a clear-cut and entrenched procedure , and so by the end of the fifteenth century , all the fundamental parliamentary procedures were worked out . This means that the parliamentarians of the seventeenth century will be able to appeal to precedent , although their interpretations may be somewhat specious . The House of Commons in the fifteenth century may not actually be deciding anything , but its formal procedures are clearly established . By the middle of the fourteenth century the separation between Lords and Commons was evident ; by 1376 the House of Commons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the abbot of Westminster . ( The room is not very large , and the members are forced to sit in two groups facing one another . Thus it may  | not be completely frivolous to suggest that an architectural accident has influenced the traditional two-party nature of the English parliamentary system . ) In 1376 we see that the Commons chooses one of its members , Sir Peter de la Mare , to " assume the duty of expressing their will in the great parliament before the . . . lords . " Sir Peter happens to be a flunkey of a great lord ? the Earl of March ? but he is also the first Speaker of the House . By 1399 , Parliament has become so confident , and its use of procedure so sophisticated , that , under the leadership of Henry of Lancaster , it undertakes to depose Richard II . The second great development , though it stands at the opposite pole from parliamentary power , is the entrenchment of the king 's council . From the late fourteenth century the council takes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men privy to the king 's secrets and desires who issue writs under the king 's privy seal , not the great seal of the realm . The privy seal is small , it is portable , personal ; the king always has it with him ; it is , somehow , less official . This is a personal kind of government . Under conciliar government taxes are collected and funneled through the household chamber instead of the more cumbersome public institution of the exchequer . The council works quietly and secretly and , by the middle of the fifteenth century , we can see that it is irresponsible . Mystery and irresponsibility are the essential qualities of conciliar and household administration . The council is very much the king 's ? it is not responsible to Parliament . In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries there were vociferous demands that the king 's ministers should be responsive to Parliament , that they should be appointed with consent of Parliament , impeached if necessary , that at least they should make reports . There was a sense , however obscure , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king relies more and more on his private administration ; he extends the activity of the royal council . It is significant that its members take an oath of secrecy . Edward IV was a master of household administration , and in his reign we encounter a new officer called the king 's secretary . At first it is hard to know what his function is . In the late fifteenth century he is , primarily , the king 's hatchet man ? an obscure , rather unsavory character who schemes and pulls strings . Though his operations are devious and elusive , he is a central figure , he plays a key role in the new form of government that allows the king to extricate himself from a royal alliance with Parliament . Edward IV , who does this very skillfully , is thus setting a pattern we will see more clearly in the early Tudor government . Royal governT H E E N G L I S H  | ment carefully husbands the resources of the crown ; it cagily exploits old taxes , it makes no new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not statute , and , when Parliament is called , the House of Commons is sure to be packed with dependents of the royal council . Though it requires intelligence and much effort to make them work in practice , the rules are simple . Do not provoke great issues of state , do not present reform legislation , do not suggest new taxes to Parliament . But manipulate the old taxes , administer affairs efficiently , pinch pennies , and issue proclamations that are ambiguous enough to be interpreted as merely declaring or clarifying what the law already is . To make sure the judicial system operates to fit the purposes of government , send sub rosa letters of instruction to the judges . Expand the scope and jurisdiction of the prerogative courts , so that they may be instituted quietly and effectively without stirring up Parliament or the lawyers . Again we note an important contradiction . Conciliar and household administration undermines ministerial responsibility . A new breed of ministers manages things so that Parliament need seldom be called . Parliament may be uneasy , but it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside the conciliar government is bound to generate the kind of tension we have already seen in law . It was a tension that found a counterpart in religion . In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries , England was the most orthodox and devout country in Europe . England was moved , as no other country was , by the coming of the friars . The friars gave self-consciousness to the burgesses and the intelligent peasants ; they inculcated the idea that men can communicate directly with God , an idea that led , rapidly enough , to the proliferation of heresy . The fourteenth and fifteenth centuries saw the rise of religious individualism in England , a movement that surged on toward the outright heresy of Lollardry and eventually culminated in radical Protestantism . At the heart of popular piety was the belief in the validity of the religious experience of the common man . The contradiction here is that in no other country in Europe was the church more under the control of royal government . After the papacy came under the control of the French monarchy early in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a schism in 1378 , there was nothing to withstand the crown . At any rate , the crown since 1066 had always run the church in England , except for a relatively brief interval extending from the first decade of the twelfth century to the first decade of the thirteenth when the king had to pay some attention to papal demands . The Waning of the Medieval Order ? 13o7 to 1471  | England had an ecclesiastical organization that was very much like a state church . Church appointments were directed by the ' crown , and the king made great use of the financial and intellectual resources of the church . But at the same time a very different kind of Christianity was flourishing . It is as though two streams flow past each other . At one level we find traditional sacerdotalism , exemplified by the power of the bishops . Bishops and kings both rule , though bishops serve the monarch . At the other extreme , under the influence of the friars , we have incipient heresy , religion based on personal experience and communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not embodied in an institution , but is charged with piety and feeling . Though they have not yet clashed directly , their incompatibility is obvious . We can begin to see the outlines of the fundamental problems of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries taking shape while Edward IV sits on the throne in the 1470 'S . The issues that will bedevil the Tudors and Stuarts can already be discerned . There is the question of law : does the law operate to serve the interest of the gentry ? or the crown ? What shall be the balance between the legal power of the gentry as exercised through the office of the J.P. , and the legal power and influence of the crown ? Next is the question of the relationship between Parliament and the king and his council . This problem is much more familiar , and it will be a great political issue in the reign of Elizabeth Tudor . Can the king rule without Parliament ? To what degree are his ministers responsible ; what are the limits of the crown ; what is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation ? These are the issues that will confront Elizabeth , James I , and will finally be settled by the men of 1688 . Then , what is the nature of Christianity in England ? Will it be a formal religion established by the episcopate and the crown , or will the standard be set by religious experience and the men , whoever they are , who are truly godly ? This is , of course , inseparable from the political question , as James I ( whose cry " No Bishop , no King , " was much more than a petulant outburst ) understood very well . The religious tension we can observe iii the fifteenth century finally appears full-blown in the confrontation of the Stuarts and the Puritans . The fundamental religious issues of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , as well as the fundamental problems of law and government , are spawned by the critical tensions that develop in the late Middle Ages . Why were these issues left unresolved until the sixteenth century and , wally , until the seventeenth ? We must remember that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I S H  | land was a relatively underdeveloped society with bad communications ; inertia alone keeps an issue from becoming crucial . Before things reach the level of " crisis " ( the label historians apply promiscuously to seventeenth-century events ) , strong personalities must intervene . It is perfectly possible , as we all know , for a society to live and function and survive despite the presence of contradictory principles . Issues may exist , but until someone bothers to raise them , to worry , to search out solutions , to agonize about them , they may lie dormant . Radical leadership , the one thing wanting in fifteenth-century England , appears late in the sixteenth century . Then a new generation of men want to resolve the tensions . They are agitated , and ? most important ? they do not keep their concern to themselves . They make the loudest complaint about religion which , in the seventeenth century , is ostensibly the one issue they mean to settle . Rather it is the problem they tackle first , not realizing at the outset how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 58o 's no generation clearly perceived the tensions and bothered to attack them . Fortescue sees them , but either he does not really care , or he does not care enough . He chooses to bury them , to obscure the contradictions in English government and society . But by the late sixteenth century this was no longer possible , and men are even more determined to have things out . The problems had been building up for two hundred years , but for two hundred years men had been distracted . First the aristocratic domination clouded all the issues . Men could hardly see that tensions were pulling at the law when the gentry and the king 's court had a common enemy in the overmighty subject . By the end of the fifteenth century , the aristocratic dust was beginning to settle , and in the 1530 's Henry VIII , with the aid of his great minister Thomas Cromwell , intended to make great changes in government and religion . There seemed to be a new rationality working in the world , and it seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capability . But the reckoning was forestalled by prosperity . As soon as the aristocracy finished beclouding the landscape , the economic boom was launched that would last for nearly a century . It is no accident that when prosperity fades toward the end of the sixteenth century , men grow more upset , more rational , and grave . In the sixteenth century men did not have to organize society , only enjoy it ; in the seventeenth they were forced to ponder , to evaluate , and to try to reshape a world in which they could find no comfort . The tensions in government , law , and religion that were already prevalent in the fifteenth century finally became critical after 1600 . The Waning of the Medieval Order ? 1307 to 1471  | As the government and society of late medieval England begin to be closely studied at last , it becomes apparent that the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries 6-o not only represent the waning of the medieval order . They also constitute the era that inaugurates the central issues which Englishmen will have to contend with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Edward I died , the problems of the early Middle Ages had been resolved through the rise of centralized government and law ; yet even in Edward 's later years a new set of problems and tensions was already forming . Given the effects of Angevin government , the institutionalization of Parliament and law in the thirteenth century , combined with the dual strands of authoritarianism and decentralization that mark the later Middle Ages , a whole new set of problems was bound to arise .  | FROM THE MEDIEVAL TO THE MODERN WORLD I. The Interpretation of Modern English History THE INTERPRETATION of medieval English history has been molded by the genius of F. W. Maitland , but our understanding of the course of the history of English government and society since the late fifteenth century has not had the benefit of an historical mind of equivalent magisterial authority . It would not be wrong to say , in fact , that since the death of Maitland in 1906 England has not produced an historian of monumental greatness . While in France in the 1930 's there were at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who brought to the study of the French past that extremely rare but necessary combination of knowledge and insight which is able to effect a revolution in historiography , the study of English history has not been shaped by scholars of this highest quality . This puzzling deficiency in English historiography is part of a much larger problem of English educational and intellectual development in the twentieth century . If the study of modern English history is still waiting for a Maitland , it has nevertheless benefited from the labor and insight of several scholars , all but one of them native or nationalized Englishmen , who while falling short of genius have yet made outstanding contributions and fun- damentally conditioned our comprehension of the course of political and social change in England since the late fifteenth century . While the process of labelling historians is bound to be over-categorical and lacking in subtlety , it is nevertheless useful to group the historians of modern England into schools according to their basic assumptions . Historians of modern England can be divided into four distinct groups , and at least three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods to warrant the label of an historical school . The first of these is the Whig-liberal school , whose most brilliant twentiethcentury representatives have been G. M. Trevelyan and the French scholar Elie Halevy . The second school of modern English history is one which relies upon a socialist , basically Marxist class conflict interpretation and whose most important spokesman has been R. H. Tawney . At the other end of the political spectrum is the school whose assumptions can apparently be identified as Tory or conservative and whose most famous protagonist has been L. B. Namier . The members of this group of historians sometimes claim the title of the School of Social Politics , although its critics would say that this is a euphemistic and questionbegging term . The last group of interpreters of modern English history might be described as the political functionalists , among whom G. R. Elton and J. H. Plumb are pre-eminent ; they are not yet sufficiently selfconscious and cohesive to be regarded as a school of historical interpretation . The most deeply rooted , consistent , holistic ? and in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of English history is the one presented by the Whig-liberal school . The long and resplendent tradition of this school goes back beyond Sir Edward Coke in the early seventeenth century to the thirteenth-century church historian Matthew Paris . The exponents of this view ? whether like Coke writing in the seventeenth century or like Stubbs and Macaulay in the nineteenth ? see all of English history as unfolding one grand theme : the struggle between the king and the community over individual liberty and the rule of law . We have seen how historians of this school have portrayed the medieval period , how they saw in it the development of English government and society to the point where the king was bound to rule with the consent of the community and to maintain the law . This was the essence of English constitutionalism as it was glimpsed in the thirteenth century and then elaborated and articulated by Coke shortly after i600 . It was Coke who firmly enunciated that the grand theme of English history was T H E E N G L I S H  | the sovereignty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common law . This interpretation was widely accepted through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , and in the mid-nineteenth century it received its most magisterial exposition in the work of Thomas Macaulay , whose narrative of English history in the later seventeenth century became the historical bestseller of all times . Macaulay saw King James II as a betrayer of the historical constitution , a wrong-headed man who tried to introduce continental absolutism into England and was justly overthrown by the Whig aristocrats who saved English free institutions . Macaulay was unblushingly moralistic and xenophobic ; the Glorious Revolution of 1688 meant to him the salvation of England from a terrible French fate . As seen by Macaulay , the English nation in 1688 had the wisdom to avoid the revolutionary mistake of the 164o 's and the good sense to leave the business of leadership to the great lords who were the upholders of the constitution and the founders of what was to become nineteenth-century liberalism . There is much to recommend Macaulay 's interpretation , and no other account of these great events has been able to provide another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are obviously defects in Macaulay 's view of 1688 as the determining turning point in English history . Undoubtedly Macaulay softened and romanticized his Whig aristocrats ; they were in fact tough , uncouth , selfish , unsentimental men whose ambiance was actually quite far from that of Macaulay and his gentle humanitarian , liberal friends of early Victorian England . It may also be questioned whether the nature of the English constitution was as fixed in 1688 and its principles as universally comprehended as Macaulay assumed . ' Whatever its defects , the Whig-liberal view is the fundamental canonical interpretation of modern English history against which all other schools have to contend and must be measured . The Whig-liberal view is also the most constitutional : for the writers of this school there really is a constitution and they focus their histories upon the constitution as a thing , a discernible entity . Furthermore the Whig-liberal historians deeply believe in the English constitution as a moral force . They think that there is a higher law governing English polity , and woe to him who violates it ? a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistency that none of the historians of other schools can match , at least when they have to view English history as a whole . Historians of other schools of interpretation have perhaps provided more convincing analyses of brief periods , but when it comes to viewing the whole scope   of modern English history since the fifteenth century only the Whigliberals can provide a framework for the whole sweep of political and social change and yet not ignore economic and intellectual factors . The Whig-liberal historians tell us that the constitution was established during the Middle Ages and that it meant the rule of law and the consent of the community . In the seventeenth century the Puritans were the first who valiantly defended the constitution against Stuart usurpation , but the Puritans discredited themselves by resorting to radical and extremist political experiments , and it was left to the great Whig aristocrats in the last decade of the seventeenth century to restore the balance of the constitution , founded on the principle of the sovereignty of the king in Parliament and the rule of the executive with the consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of the constitution was its democratization through the broadening of the franchise in the nineteenth century . The Whig-liberal historians believed that the constitutional adjustments after 1689 required to make the system work properly came about with a minimum of difficulty and certainly without the revolutionary upheaval that marked the history of continental states . There were of course important disputes and debates and a couple of critical moments when the political consensus was threatened . George III in the 176o 's tried to turn the clock back and undo the settlement of 1688 , and in 1832 the landed classes had to be pressured into sharing their power with the urban middle class . But these crises were weathered without the need for a revolution . In marked contrast to French violence and cataclysms , in the two centuries after 1688 the English constitution was peacefully adjusted to serve the needs of modern industry , empire , and democracy . As seen by the Whig-liberal historian , the eighteenth century produced the cabinet system by a kind of natural institutional childbirth , and in the nineteenth century the constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the same old medieval constitution , steadily adapted to meet the changing needs of modern society . The Whig-liberal interpretation can be dreadfully dull , bland , smug , and unsubtle , but in the hands of its best protagonists it is intelligent and highly convincing . The Whig-liberal historians have remained un . matched for the quality of their narrative art , and this is not surprising since their interpretation offers a view of English history which best provides a coherent framework for a compelling and consistent account of a long period . The finest twentieth-century exemplar of the Whig-liberal T H E E N G L I S H   tradition was a scion of the comfortable pre-World War I upper middle class , George Macaulay Trevelyan , great-nephew of Thomas Macaulay . Trevelyan wrote several books on various eras of English history from the fourteenth to the twentieth centuries ; all have been bestsellers , and justifiably so because of the humanity , literary skill , and breadth of view which distinguishes all of this historian 's work . Perhaps Trevelyan 's outstanding book is England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most readable and on the whole the most convincing political history of seventeenth-century England . We can easily criticize his tendency to foreshorten and simplify , to assume there was a liberal rule of law in the Middle Ages , that the Stuarts were betrayers of the constitution , that the whole issue was neatly resolved in 1689 , and we can not believe that the late seventeenth-century aristocrats were really as humane and sensitive as Trevelyan depicts them . But we still must agree with Trevelyan that liberty was the fundamental issue behind the seventeenth-century conflict , and although he may have romanticized the people about whom he writes , he makes them real and alive for us in a quite personal and unforgettable way . Among the legion of writers on seventeenthcentury English history no one has succeeded as well as Trevelyan in making us care about the issues of the period . For the Whig-liberal school the only significant problem of English history after 1689 is to determine how the people were brought specifically within the constitution so that political democracy was finally achieved in an industrial society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second and third decades of the twentieth century provided a fullscale account of the democratization of the eighteenth-century constitution . Halevy was ideologically committed to liberalism and had the romantic passion for English institutions of which perhaps only a foreigner is capable ; he was a product of a tradition of admiring Frenchmen going back to Voltaire and Montesquieu . An unkind critic would say that Halevy understood nineteenth-century England not much better than Montesquieu understood the realities of the eighteenth-century constitution . Halevy intended to write the History of the English People from 1815 to 1914 ; in several volumes he dealt with the period from 1815 to about 1850 and from 1895 to 1914 , but he never lived to give his account of the intervening era . Although Halevy worked only from published sources , his learning was prodigious and at his best he is a grand and impressive scholar ; he can also be very tedious , and the later volumes lie wrote , dealing with the 1830 's and-1840 's , arc both dull and confused .   ' I he first volume of his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show the forces in English society which made possible the movement from Whiggery to liberalism , from aristocracy to democracy , is generally regarded as a masterpiece and is certainly the most persuasive and influential of his many volumes . Halevy enriched but did not substantially alter the Whig-liberal interpretation . He tells us that the ramshackle eighteenth-century oligarchic political and social system was rationalized and democratized through the impact of two great ideas ? utilitarian philosophy and evangelical religion . Many historians have been convinced by Halevy that these two strands of thought are indeed the dominant themes of nineteenth-century English history . But subsequent research and consideration have raised doubts about how clear-cut and effective was the impact of utilitarianism and evangelicalism on nineteenthcentury English government and society . Historians have come to question Halevy 's optimistic conclusion that the leaders of English society in the nineteenth century came to be overwhelmingly inspired by these liberal and humane ideals . But no ? other writer has been able to present such a grand account of the process of political , social , and intellectual change in England between 1815 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded the Whig-liberal interpretation of English history with a final inspiring chapter . In the 1930 'S it was fashionable to sneer at the Whig-liberal school of historians but the more work that is done on English history , and the more other schools attempt to undermine the views of Macaulay , Trevclyan , and Halevy , the more imposing and permanent does their achievement appear . Naive in some ways , these historians possessed and controlled a total vision of the English past and they presented it in a glowing and eloquent manner . Whether any particular historical theory is ultimately true is something very hard to know , and no general view of the whole history of a society can fit all the data and be impervious to criticism . But any interpretation that is unified , generally applicable , sane , consistent , and morally persuasive will always have a great deal of merit in use , and this can be confidently asserted about the work of Macaulay and his twentieth-century disciples . Although the Whig-liberal historians have been assaulted from both the left and the right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really viable and holistic interpretation to supplant it . The socialist and ' I'ory attempts at the demolition of the Whig theory of English history were roughly contemporaneous , and they were the special occupation of   the generation of scholars working between about 1910 and 1940 . The first to arouse the imagination of readers , and not just academic ones , was the socialist critique , whose originator and most convincing spokesman was Richard Henry Tawney . It could be argued that Tawney had more influence on twentieth-century England than any other member of his generation , Winston Churchill notwithstanding . We can say this in all seriousness because Tawney 's influence was for change , and for change in the direction of the welfare state , which was finally effected in England in the late 1940 's . R. H. Tawney was a doctrinaire Christian socialist , a Fabian , and something of a Marxist as well , who drew heavily upon the great Protestant lower middle class traditions of righteous indignation . He was an important leader in the establishment of adult education in England before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party intellectual . Tawney held the chair of economic history at the London School of Economics for three decades , and with his immense learning and elegant style he devoted himself to the systematic undermining of the Whig-liberal interpretation . It can not be said that he succeeded in demolishing that interpretation but he made it at least seem one-sided and tendentious , and induced not only professional historians but also the general educated reader to question the validity of its assumptions . Tawney 's general view of English history is already evident in his first book , The Agrarian Problem in the Sixteenth Century , which was published before the First World War . It is a broadly conceived , beautifully written , fascinating work , although the effectiveness of its argument has been somewhat vitiated by later research which has cast doubt upon the validity of the pertinent statistical information on changes in rural society which Tawney worked out and from which he drew his conclusions . Tawney 's second historical book , Religion and the Rise of Capitalism , published in the late 1920 'S , offers a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventeenth centuries ; it had an astonishing influence on the historical outlook of a whole generation and it remains , although no longer as widely read or seriously regarded , a profound and important work . Tawney 's view of English history is based on economic determinism . He accounted for historical change since 1500 in terms of the rise , development , and impact of capitalism . He believed that the capitalist spirit definitely predominated in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England , and discusses it with the same angry and bitter tones he uses to do pounce the " acquisitive society " of modern industrial capitalism For   Tawney , the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century gentry are as exploitative , greedy , and class-conscious as the meanest nineteenth-century coal and cotton barons . Like the Whig-liberal historians , Tawney also had a vision of what things were like in medieval England . He begins by positing medieval society as a kind of proto-socialist paradise , a paternalistic world where guilds sheltered the worker while monks dispensed charity and ecclesiastical authority inhibited usurers . Socialist theorists always have to set up a golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of man is basically good , and that it is only an irrationally organized society which produces evil and corruption in the world . In Tawney 's view , what broke up this happy medieval community was the rise of capitalist agriculture at the beginning of the sixteenth century . The Stuart kings represent for Tawney the last ineffective vestiges of medieval paternalism , which was why the rising capitalists had to destroy them . In the earlier sixteenth century , Tawney tells us , the new capitalist landlords and the crown formed an uneasy alliance in opposition to the old feudal aristocracy , and both the monarchy and the gentry grew rich while the position of the aristocracy was undermined , the monasteries were obliterated , and the peasants were ground under . By the seventeenth century this alliance was no longer tenable because the insatiable capitalists of rural England and the rising merchant class were clamoring for an uncontrolled economic system so they could pursue their economic interests in a rational and untrammeled manner . Thus the civil war of the 164o 's , in Tawney 's view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambition to break the last inhibiting shackles of the medieval community . In Religion and the Rise of Capitalism Tawney tried to show how the capitalists transformed Protestantism into their ideological vehicle and made Calvinism their special social ethic . In the 1930 's this book was hailed by all sorts of people eager to prove that religion was a bad thing , despite the fact that Tawney had not said this at all . Rather , he contended that Protestantism was corrupted and made to serve the interests of capitalist exploitation , and it would be impossible to deny t hat there is some truth in this view . There has been a long train of Tawney disciples working on TudorStuart history ? Christopher Hill and Lawrence Stone are the most prominent ones writing today . Hill 's earlier work was little more than crass undergraduate Marxism but his more recent work has provided valuable insights into the course of social and intellectual change in the seventeenth century . Ile is not as enamored as his master of early Stuart T H E E N G L I S H @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these kings than the Whig-liberal historians . But generally Hill continues to portray the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as the initial stage of modern capitalism whose first great triumph in the overthrow of the Stuart monarchy in the 164o 's was only part of the general destruction of the framework of medieval culture and society and the groundswell of the wave that swept on to the Industrial Revolution . Stone , a brilliant and omnivorously learned Oxford scholar who now holds a distinguished chair at Princeton , followed Tawney 's interpretation closely in his early work . But his later studies in Tudor-Stuart history demonstrate a remarkable broadening of vision . Stone 's most recent analysis of late sixteenth and early seventeenth century English development is strongly under the influence of the great historian of the French Revolution , Georges Lefebvre , who qualified his Marxist paradigm of social change with a complex causality drawn from twentieth-century sociological theory . Indeed , there are some strong parallels between Stone 's view of social change in Elizabethan and early Stuart England and Lefebvre 's explanation of the coming of the French Revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in society and the aborting of an aristocratic revival are made central themes . In his recent work , Stone has qualified Tawney 's view of the central role of class struggle in English history with the theme of social mobility ? the tendency of people of middling and lower status in pre-industrial society not to seek the emancipation and power of their own class , but rather to move upward into the class above . This view gives primacy to class relationships , but not class conflicts . The same sociological theme prevails in Peter Laslett 's illuminating study of English society in 1700 , The World We Have Lost . Oddly enough , at least until very recently , the socialist historians have not been able to provide satisfactory accounts of the Industrial Revolution itself ; their eyes are so filled with tears for the sufferings of the proletariat that they can not critically examine the rise of modern industrial economy and society . Between the world wars a Fabian husbandand-wife team , J. L. and Barbara Hammond , ground out book after book , each one more breathless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate of the English workers in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries . It was not hard for more clear-sighted and less sentimental economic historians of a conservative inclination , John Clapham and T. S. Ashton , to present statistical evidence showing   that real wages rose during the Industrial Revolution and that most workers were probably better off than they had ever been before . Eric Hobsbawm has revived the socialist indictment of the Industrial Revolution and claims that his assessment of the evidence confirms the earlier socialist view of the Industrial Revolution as a hellish era for the English workingman . It is obvious that different assumptions about what is or is not a good society will lead to very different conclusions on the moral significance of the Industrial Revolution . But this endless debate seems irrelevant in the context of the broader and fundamental problem of how and why eighteenth-century England experienced rapid industrialization and urbanization , and what these changes meant for English government , education , religion , and culture . It is curious that in the 1920 's and 30 's no Tawney disciple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply the socialist view of English history to the period after 1700 . This important work is at last under way in the 196o 's . During the late 1950 's , after a hiatus of a generation , a new group of important neo-Marxist scholars and critics has appeared in Britain . And in this group , Hobsbawm , George Rude , and Edward Thompson stand out as historians of the age of transition from pre-industrial to modern society , from the mid-eighteenth to the mid-nineteenth centuries . Their studies are contributions toward a definitive left-wing interpretation of the emergence of industrialization and urbanization and the forming of working-class consciousness in England . In the decade before the First World War , when Tawney was inaugurating the socialist onslaught on the Whig-liberal interpretation of modern English history , certain Roman Catholic writers made the first attempts to enunciate a view of the English past from a right-wing position . But this Catholic historiography never achieved respectability among academic historians ; it immediately was bogged down by a lachrymose yearning for a medieval golden age that never existed and absurd apologetics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of English history was almost entirely the result of the impact of one scholar , Lewis Bernstein Namier . The following that Namier eventually gained in academic circles throughout the English-speaking world was even greater than that enjoyed by Tawney in the 1930 's ; therefore , it would probably be true to conclude that Namier was the most influential of all twentieth-century historians of modern Britain . Although his own work on English history was confined largely to studies of the nature of politics in the 1760 's , Namier 's interpretations and methods were taken up T H E E N G L I S H   and applied also to sixteenth- , seventeenth- , and nineteenth-century English history . Namier published his most important work in the late 1920 's and 1930 's , but it was not until the late 1940 's and 1950 'S that he came to play the leading role in English historiography , to the point that Namierism was regarded by many academic scholars as synonymous with scholarship itself . Namier 's influence and popularity were the result not only of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socialism experienced by the younger generation of English historical scholars . After the New Jerusalem of the Labor government of 1945-1951 had proved to be no more glorious than the free false teeth provided by the National Health Service , scholars who had become disenchanted with Tawney 's class struggle and yet did not subscribe to faith in Trevelyan 's liberal humanism rallied to Namier 's Tory-conservative interpretation of the English past . During the 1950 's Namier 's work was if anything more vehemently acclaimed in the United States than in England . It is hard to know whether this was an index of American appreciation of Namier 's self-conscious realism or rather of the peculiar fact that so many American historians of England are at heart romantic adulators of the English aristocracy . There are obvious parallels between L. B. Namier and the nineteenthcentury Tory statesman-theorist Benjamin Disraeli . Namier was the scion of a wealthy converted Polish-Jewish family which had envied the Polish nobility from whose ranks it was excluded . Sent to study at Oxford before the First World War , young Namier developed an intense admiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to indulge during the twentieth century . This went hand in hand with Namier 's detestation of liberal ideology and indeed of all ideological formulations . It was not until 1931 when he had already published his first important work that Namier was able to obtain an academic post , and throughout his life he was chagrined by his failure to secure a place at Oxbridge . Until he became a professor Namier was a successful business executive , and this experience confirmed his deep-rooted belief that the only important thing in history is power , the only people who count are the " political nation , " the men who control power , and the most interesting problem confronting the historian is analysis of the social bases of power . Namier was the first English historian to take account of Freudian psychology , which he used , as was fashionable in the 1930 's and 1940 's , to undermine liberal ideology . Namier believed that hardly anyone ever grows up , particularly people inclined to radical political programs . He   was himself obsessed with neuroses and insecurity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominate men and to explain politics in terms of neurotic behavior . Without actually using Freudian terminology in his historical writings , Namier understood Freud 's doctrines to confirm his anti-intellectual and anti-ideological bias . Anyone who enunciated a liberal or radical idea was for Namier ipso facto maladjusted and compensating for an unhappy childhood . In Namier 's view the distinguishing characteristic of human thought and action is " senseless irrelevancy . " Namier 's initial research on the 1760 's was inspired by the work of some American historians of the American Revolution who , he realized , were not blindly following the Whig-liberal view of eighteenth-century British politics . His own great book , The Structure of Politics at the Accession of George III , aimed to show that the apparent moral and ideological struggles of George III 's reign were meaningless smoke screens . Namier was a very careful researcher and his thesis is supported by an overwhelming mass of . evidence . Yet he only studied closely two to three years of English history , and these happen to be the three years when there really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masks , and when the only things that made political life go were aristocratic interests , patronage , and clientage . But " Namierism " became inflated into a doctrine , a general statement about the nature of all British politics : all that matters in politics is social power , the top people in the county , great families and their interests , and high-sounding liberal ideologies are just a facade . The Marquis of Rockingham may hire a brilliant theorist like Edmund Burke to make fancy noises , but this is just another clever political move . There is much skill and practicality , no profound , idealistic commitment in English politics . As far as the early 1760 's are concerned , Namier happened to be right , but this was one of the most miserable of all eras in English history . But once Namierism was expanded into a general principle , as it was in the late 1940 's and 1950 's , it was easy to make facile judgments that all liberals were either clever self-seekers or dupes and that all socialists were cranks overcompensating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the neoconservative attitude of the younger generation of English historical scholars and intellectuals who were experiencing a long withdrawal from the radicalism of the 1930 'S . Namier allowed the left-wingers to shift ground without abandoning their contempt for Macaulay and Trevelyan . Clinging to their old disdain for the traditional Whig interpretation , T H E E N G L I S H   they merely adjusted their , conclusions and rushed to apply a Namierite interpretation to all the eras of modern British history . Both Tawney and Namier dissented from Whig-liberal constitutionalism . Both saw English history as a struggle for power and working out of class interest . Both believed that the great constitutional issues morally exalted for centuries by the Whig-liberal school were only veils , that the real motivating forces in history are class interests and the struggle for power . ' Where these seminal minds of twentieth-century historiography diverge more than in any other aspect of their work is in their final evaluation . Tawney tells us that all of English history from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries was deplorable ; Namier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although Namier claims to be a realist and although on the surface he does seem to be cool , dry , and extremely realistic , he too was captivated by an ideology ? a rather archaic kind of romantic nationalism . In the 1920 's Namier was a fervent supporter of Zionism ; his view of English history was conditioned by the same kind of political romanticism . For Namier , nothing ever changed in modern English history ; the top people in the counties were always on top , they deserved to be , and through the dominance of the Conservative party they always should be . Namier sounds very much like the eighteenth-century founder of romantic conservatism , Edmund Burke , but it is Burke at his worst ? sentimental , snobbish , and blinded by a dizzying adulation of dukes . While the high tide of Namierism was already beginning to recede in the 196o 's , this scholar 's impress upon the understanding of the English past is both permanent and profound . What Namier did succeed in showing is that we should not blithely take moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must analyze all the available sources and must attempt biographical studies not only of great men but even of obscure politicians . We must look for the underlying personal motivations of political actions ; we must not believe everything ? possibly not anything ? that politicians proclaim . Namier contributed an aspect of hard reality to English politics . He taught us that to read theorists like Burke is not enough ; we must also study the papers of political organizers like the Duke of Newcastle ; we must see the day-to-day manipulations of practical men working behind the ideologues ' oratorical screens . Even those historians who can not agree that the Whig-liberal ideology is mainly propaganda henceforth have to examine the hard social and political realities behind the traditional ideals . What was particularly valuable in Namier 's work was the method he   employed ? the extensive use of the most minute , probing kind of political biography . In the last stage of his career Namier conceived and inaugurated a vast project for publishing the biography of every member of Parliament since the time of Edward I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those on which Namier himself worked , dealing with the second half of the eighteenth century ; they have not yielded any startling revelations but they will be a mine for future researchers . Namier also fostered a new interest in local and family history , not for antiquarian purposes but rather with the aim of establishing the social bases of English politics . While Trevelyan envisioned the persistence of a central constitutional ideal and Tawney the permanence of class struggle , Namier communicated a feeling for the continuity of English country life . He made us realize that whatever the upheavals at the center , the social structure of rural England and its way of life changed little from the sixteenth to the later nineteenth centuries . Thereby he allowed us to place many of the constitutional struggles which had so exercised the imagination of the Whig-liberal historians in a broader and more realistic framework . The major criticism that can be brought against Namier 's devotion to country and family history is that he was too exclusively concerned with one stratum of society . The working classes are ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shopkeepers even pass unnoticed . Namier does not seem to know or care , although certainly many of his beloved dukes both knew and cared , about what was happening in the streets of London and Manchester . We also find missing in Namier what is so compelling in the best kind of twentiethcentury French local historiography ? a sense of the land itself , of the peasants , the fields , the crops , the agricultural tools , and the weather . It never rains in Namier-land . Although Namier raised a whole generation of young scholarly disciples to apply his theses and methods to various aspects of eighteenthcentury history , none of these has achieved the stature of his master . The two most important twentieth-century historians of eighteenth-century England after Namier are Herbert Butterfield , a neo-Whig and a fierce critic of Namierism , and George Rude , an extremely subtle neo-Marxist . The most distinguished member of the Namier school is J. E. Neale , who has done for the sixteenth century what Namier did for the eighteenth , although with a much higher degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published in 1953 , interprets sixteenthcentury English politics in terms of county social structure . Politics , Par-T H E E N G L I S H   liament , and election all appear as routine aspects of the life of the ruling families in county society . Everything depends on patronage and clientage ; ideas are insignificant and the Elizabethan House of Commons itself is only a reflection of the framework of power and wealth in the county . Neale 's study is the most eloquent and persuasive exposition of the Namierite interpretation . Yet in his later work , Elizabeth I and Her Parliaments , Neale appears to depart from Namierism and to take ideology and religious disputes very seriously . Passionate speeches in Parliament about liberty become significant after all . The fulcrum of politics is now a small articulate Puritan group , and Parliament is caught up in the great European ideological struggle focusing on religion . Social interests , though present and important , are not the actual forces of change , and the account of sixteenth-century politics in Neale 's later study would gladden the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicts arising out of the Cold War of the 1950 's appear to have powerfully influenced Neale 's outlook , and he suddenly seems to have realized that political and religious slogans could signify deep beliefs and become powerful agents of social change . Several historians , of whom Norman Gash and H. J. Hanham are perhaps the most important , have applied the Namierite interpretation to nineteenth-century English politics . They have succeeded in demonstrating the hard reality of the continuity of oligarchic , aristocratic leadership in the midst of all the famous conflicts about reform bills and all the utilitarian and evangelical doctrines that Halevy found so central . But every reader of Disraeli 's novels knows that the great country houses still commanded enormous influence in the face of a rising industrial society , and the general significance of the work of the Namierite school on nineteenth-century English politics still remains to be assessed . Weariness with both socialist and conservative history is reflected in the work of the new men of English historiography who came to the fore in the 1950 's . Neither sentimental liberals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men with few illusions . They tend to be from the middle or lower middle class , and they are intensely professional in attitude . Blinded by no slogans , they subscribe , but not in any naive or sentimental way , to liberal constitutionalism . They will not melt at the sight of a duke , nor do they bleed for the working class ; rather , they try to show the eras of English history in the round . Rejecting categories and dialectic , they are tough-minded rational men with excellent scholarly training behind them , whose alert minds arc prepared to examine   any kind of evidence in order to build up a total picture of the development of English government and society . G. R. Elton and J. H. Plumb best exemplify this new generation of English historical scholars , who , having absorbed the criticism which socialists and Namierites directed at the Whig notions of constitutional history , are going beyond the interpretations of the three traditional schools . The independent judgment that Elton and Plumb exhibit in their work is partly a reflection of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most English historians of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have stemmed . Elton is the son of a German emigre classical scholar , and although he came to England as a child he has retained a certain detachment in his studies of sixteenth-century government . He is awesomely industrious ; no one for half a century has so completely mastered the sources of Tudor history . From the work he has done thus far , of which the most important is a magnificent general history of sixteenth-century England , it is quite clear that Elton possesses the most powerful critical mind at work on English history since Tawney , and indeed perhaps since Maitland . Elton is not without his own passionate interests . His admiration is reserved for bureaucracy , for technical , administrative , and legal competence , for governmental rationalism . As far as he is concerned , a government that can function well , even if it somewhat bruises individual liberty in the process , is good government . Elton has more tolerance than perhaps any other important writer on English history for authoritarian tendencies , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlightened and open society . What is important for Elton is getting the job done , and the important people are the men who can deal with the complex and exhausting problems of administration and law in an effective and rational manner . It scarcely matters who they are or from which class . The intelligent successful administrators , not aristocrats or theorists or saints , are the men who count . These are the men , Elton tells us , who made England , at least England in the sixteenth century , and he has an unmatched ability for showing them to us and allowing us to see political and social problems through their eyes . J. H. Plumb has a working class origin ; as a graduate of the University of Leicester , he was one of C. P. Snow 's original " new men . " Plumb studied at Cambridge under G. M. Trevelyan , whom he greatly admires , but at the same time in his own work on early eighteenth-century English politics and government he has clearly absorbed the best of what T H E E @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to teach . The tone of Plumb 's work is more liberal , personal , and humanitarian than Elton 's ; he has gone further than any scholar toward achieving a union of Whiggery and Namierism . His biography of Sir Robert Walpole , the eighteenth-century politician , is informed by a perpetuation of the old Whig-liberal feeling , but it is expounded in a much more realistic way and incorporates more social and economic history than the older Whig-liberal historians ever dreamed existed . After having provoked a debate lasting for half a century , the Whigliberal view still remains the only sensible , full interpretation of English history , but it has had to yield to the strong demands from both left and right for greater realism . The rising generation of English historians applauds the beneficent outcome of centuries of political and social change . But they want to find out , without being blinded by previous commitment to sentimental illusions , how the outcome was reached . The answers are found in many ways and places , some of them rather bizarre and unexpected and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks the technique of Elton , Plumb , and the new group of English historians , and it is the key to what may be termed their hard-headed political functionalism . They are willing to consider a great variety of explanations of what made modern English government , however inconsistent or incongruous . They recognize and even admire the grand constitutional theme set forth by the Whig-liberal historians , but they no longer feel bound explicitly either to justify or to attack it . II . The Pursuit of the Modern THE ACCESSION of Henry Tudor in 1485 is one of the select group of dates every English schoolboy and American college history student can identify , and it has come to be regarded as marking a great turning point in English history . How did 1485 come to be fundamental in English historiography , and is the beginning of the reign of Henry VII really of basic significance in the history of English government and society ? It is often said by historians who hate to worry over vexing problems of periodization that dates like 1485 that are used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventions and handy devices , and that no one need believe they represent anything important . But periodization , much as we may rail against it , does matter very much to the historian . Once he chooses a set of dates as marking a period ? no matter how random and arbitrary the original choice ? this chronological fixing of an era inevitably conditions how the historian looks at the events , which have now been given a certain clarity and shape , and a date once established as beginning a new era will linger on in historical thought long after it has been proven unjustified and has outlived its usefulness . The trouble with dates is that people who bother to learn them hate to unlearn them and trouble themselves with new ones . The question of whether 1485 is a decisive turning point in English history is part of the larger problem of whether we should view the reigns of the Tudor monarchs from 1485 to 1603 as comprising a distinct and identifiable era in English history , and if so , what common qualities we should attribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is not entirely comfortable with the distinct periodization implied by the title of his book , England under the Tudors , but he can justify it by reflecting that England from 1485 to 1603 was after all ruled by a single dynasty . Some degree of unity was of course imposed on these decades by this dynastic fact , but it is necessary to go beyond this ( as Elton in fact does ) and consider whether the term Tudor period implies an identifiable era in the history of English society , government , and culture . The first nineteenth-century writer who called attention to the Tudors and their special place in the whole scheme of English history was J. A. Froude in his History of England from the Fall of Wolsey to the Defeat of the Spanish Armada ( 1529-1588 ) . Froude was a vehement Protestant nationalist , a violent anti-Catholic , an extremely effective writer in the romantic style , and the first masterly historian to study closely sixteenthcentury England . He was something of an English Michelet but he also suffered unfortunately from a malady that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which the chief symptom is an inability to get anything exactly straight . Froude 's Tudor history was written as a tract against popery and continental despotism ; everything sweeps on to the grand climax of the defeat of the Armada in 1588 , which Froude depicts as the most dramatic event in human history since Moses received the tablets . Soon after Froude came the Victorian publicist J. R. Green who coined the bright phrase " new monarchy , " an admirable phenomenon that seemed to appear suddenly in England in 1485 . The new Tudor monarchy , T H E E N G L I S H   Green believed , was a novel kind of government thoroughly distinctive from what had gone before ? and much better . This attractive term , applied not only to English but also to continental political developments , has become embedded in historical rhetoric , where it has stuck so firmly that it has not been possible to pry it out in spite of cautions and animadversions by many twentieth-century scholars . It may still be permissible to use the term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new about the Tudor monarchs , beyond their Welsh blood . What is most surprising about the attitude of the Victorian historians toward the Tudors is their unabashed admiration for these dynasts who believed so unequivocally in the divine right of kings . At first sight it seems strange that the nineteenth-century historians , all of them sincerely committed to liberal ideals , could be enthusiastic about the toughminded , despotically inclined people who ran Tudor government ? so enthusiastic that they were quick to apologize for and either overlook or explain away some of the Tudors ' more unsavory authoritarian qualities . Obviously there were important factors conditioning the nineteenthcentury response to sixteenth-century monarchy , and the first of these is the nature of the sources themselves . The sources for fifteenth-century English history are extremely difficult to read and understand ; most of the administrative and legal documents are written in depressingly poor handwriting and almost incomprehensible legal French , and even when in the latter half of the century English generally becomes the language of the sources , they are still difficult , frustrating , and uninspiring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come the beautifully drafted Tudor statutes and proclamations . Starting with the documents of Henry VII , the royal government exhibits an astonishing facility in its command of language , and with the statutes of Henry VIII , particularly those of the 1530 's , we find the rolling preambles and gorgeous phrases that still have power to overcome the will and work like poetry on the imagination . The historian is always strongly tempted to believe that the rhetorical medium is equivalent to the message about the past . In studying Tudor history , it is almost impossible to separate style from content , very difficult to extrapolate the full implications of the statutes from their subtle phrasing ; and we are never quite sure whether the magnificent language represents humanist rhetoric or a significant political doctrine . But no matter what they really mean , the Tudor documents are always exciting to read . Tlw best of them have a felicitous Shakespearean ring , and in fact this excellence of language appears iii sixteenth-century political   documents before it is found in belletristic literature . No legislation in English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reformation Parliament of the 1530 'S . In studying the Lancastrian and Yorkist periods , modern scholars flounder among muddled and dreary manuscripts , and then after 1485 they seem to emerge from darkness into light , and it is hard to resist the conclusion that this rhetorical Renaissance reflects the reality of political and social change . The chief means which the historian has to apprehend the nature of a society , particularly one for which there is no substantial and reliable statistical information , is through its language , and the very confidence and skill of Tudor English predisposes the historian to see 1485 as a great turning point . Any sensitive and highly literate scholar who peruses the legislation of Henry VIII can hardly keep from feeling in his heart something of momentous consequence has happened . Another reason why the hundred and fifty years before 1485 remain confused and murky is that the printed sources for the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries are so scanty and defective ; much more documentation has in fact been published for the reign of Henry II than for the reign of Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tudor revival prompted the publication under crown auspices of the Calendar of State Papers , a voluminous collection of summaries of governmental , administrative , and legal documents . The Calendar comprises not only domestic papers , such as the records of the Tudor Privy Council , but also extensive extracts from continental archives , of which the Spanish and Venetian have turned out to be particularly valuable ? perhaps too valuable . The Spanish and Venetian ambassadors at the Tudor court provided long and elaborate accounts of what they found there . These accounts are indeed fascinating and informative , but it is often hard to know how far to rely on them . Certainly there is a great deal of wishful thinking in the Spanish correspondence 's attempt to play down the rise of Protestant attitudes in England , and the learned Italians were so charmed by the classical learning they found at the Tudor court that they did not see much else that was happening in England . In addition to the vast collection of documents available in the Calendar of State Papers , the historian of sixteenth-century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pamphlets , particularly on religious questions , with the result that he can gain a much clearer sense of public opinion than would be possible for any time during the medieval period . We are now familiar with the thesis propounded by T H E E N G L I S H   Marshall McLuhan : in the intellectual and social history of Western civilization the technological medium is the message itself , that is , the means of communication of ideas have tremendous significance for the way in which these ideas are received and understood . Not only was the new use of the printing press to communicate ideas of the greatest significance for sixteenth-century English society and culture ; it also inevitably has affected the way in which we comprehend the sixteenth century . A society which can speak to us directly through printed books expounding opinions on all manner of political and religious subjects will tend to appear more like our own than one whose ideas have to be painfully extrapolated from a small group of awkward manuscripts . For the Tudor period it is possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ignore the masses of documents that still remain unpublished . Until the 1950 's historians relied much too exclusively on the published sources which , in spite of the richness of their information on matters of high politics , have some very important gaps . The printed material is particularly weak in legal records , so that our knowledge of how the statutes and royal proclamations were actually enforced is frequently based on a rather hazardous guess . While the Court of Star Chamber is an institution that looms large on the Tudor scene , historians have built whole theories about the operation of this court from a very small body of published material , and reliable conclusions on sixteenth-century legal process would require difficult and painstaking research in manuscript sources . Not only a visceral response to Tudor rhetoric , but other feelings as well , conditioned the image of sixteenth-century England that historians constructed . Victorian writers shared general historiographical assumptions resting on deep-seated nationalist and Protestant sentiments . Nationalism had already prompted nineteenth-century historians to look for the origins of beneficent English institutions in the medieval past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discover the beginnings of English power , economic supremacy , and imperial expansion in the Tudor era . Not surprisingly , during the last two decades of the nineteenth century , when imperial attitudes were most aggressive and strident in Britain , the achievements of the Tudor dynasty were most vehemently celebrated . It was only natural to perceive in the dashing exploits of the intrepid " Elizabethan seadogs " the starting point of invincible English sea power and to transmute , by some kind of patriotic   alchemy , slave traders like Sir John Hawkins and pirates like Sir Francis Drake into patriotic admirals and heroic Protestant gentlemen . This kind of myth-making declined somewhat after 1914 with the general deflation of imperialist attitudes , but after the Second World War , when English feelings of pride and power needed boosting , historians once more tried to evoke the heroic glories of the first Elizabethan age . Along with untrammeled nationalism , strong Protestant sentiment contributed to the making of the Tudor image . A deep-rooted , at times hysterical , anti-Catholic feeling prevailed well into the later decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's there were anti-Catholic riots in the streets of London . Under these conditions it was again natural to look back fondly to the era when England broke out of popish bondage , supposedly vanquished superstition , replaced the cloister with the hearth , and established a sound and truly national religion . Until the very end of the nineteenth century no English historian who commanded an audience doubted that the Reformation was one of the very best and most wholesome things in all of English history . By 1900 Catholic publicists like G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc had inaugurated a vociferous reply to this traditional view of the Reformation . In their counteroffensive they went so far as to suggest that the English Reformation was cruel , crooked , and nasty both in its motives and its consequences . But they could not undermine the general consensus that the coming of Protestantism had a beneficent effect on English society , that it contributed to a more profound sense of individual liberty , and that it was one of the great legacies of the Tudor monarchy . A third factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept of modernity , the notion that around the year 1500 Western civilization suddenly passed from its medieval to its modern phase . This advance to modernity is held to have taken place contemporaneously in all important aspects of political , social , and intellectual life : the modern state transcended medieval feudalism , Renaissance humanism flourished in the place of scholastic obscurantism , Protcstantism triumphed over popery , science conquered superstition , and a capitalist economy rose to supplant a backward agrarian system . Historians went in search of anything modern in sixteenth-century England ; they came up with an extensive assortment of items and were able to demonstrate that a great transformation in civilization occurred under the Tudor aegis . Although vehemently criticized by many scholars in the T H E E N G L I S H   past half century , the concept of modernity has proved to be the most impregnable aspect of the image of sixteenth-century England which the Victorian writers initially established . The first great Tudor historian of the twentieth century was A. F. Pollard , who published several important studies in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prolific editor of archival material , Pollard achieved a mastery of the sources of Tudor history . He was extremely learned in the political history of the first half of the sixteenth century , and was also a firm , clear , and convincing writer . It is symptomatic of the intellectual and moral climate of Edwardian England that a scholar of Pollard 's stature had a very hard time securing a university chair ; in bad old imperial Germany Pollard would early in his career have become a full professor with the rank and salary of a cabinet minister . After a lengthy stint writing articles for the Dictionary of National Biography , Pollard was finally given a chair at the University of London , but at first the post was purely honorary and carried no stipend . This happened , we may recall , while British wealth and prestige stood rather high in the world . The reasons behind Pollard 's professional ill-fortune are to be found in the malaise that blighted English society in the early decades of the twentieth century . Yet Pollard never allowed these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical scholarship ; he founded the Institute for Historical Research at the University of London , the first English parallel to the great German and French graduate schools . Pollard wrote at a time when fortunately it was still assumed that the historian 's proper audience was the general public , and his studies of early Tudor history are still important , relevant , and compelling . His favorite approach was biographical ; through biographies of the outstanding leaders of English government and religion in the first half of the sixteenth century he succeeded in presenting an interpretation of the whole period . Although Pollard 's ideas about the formation of character were preFreudian , Pollard was not at all insensitive to psychological problems . His biography of Wolsey , Henry VIII 's chief minister in the 1520 'S , is still the only study of this important and complex man that is worth reading , and his Henry VIII is the best account we have , although he attributed to the king some achievements which later writers believe were mainly the work of Henry 's ministers . Pollard did attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not as impressive a narrative historian as he is a biographer . Pollard 's bent for strictly political history and   his inability to place statecraft within a social and economic framework make his general history rather arid reading today . Nevertheless Pollard 's interpretation of the reigns of Henry VII and VIII ( 1485-1547 ) rapidly became the standard view , the classic picture for which all subsequent interpretations are corrections , adjustments , and revisions . Pollard 's work outlined the basic structure of the new age ; the Tudor era saw the onset of statism , nationalism , and modernity , the beginning of modern England . Pollard described a new national monarchy , highly competent , aggressive , and ? not least important ? enormously popular . He believed that in the sixteenth century the monarchy was at last leading the English people in the direction they wanted to go . The Tudor rulers created a strong centralized state , fostered industrial and commercial expansion , and cemented the spiritual unity of the nation by establishing a sensible Protestantism , which turned out to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were seen as the engineers of the breakaway from the disorganized feudal world of the fifteenth century . From aristocratic , chaotic , ineffective government England moved with startling swiftness to a national , modern , dynamic state . Not only did the Tudors lead and inspire the national spirit ; in their own persons they were also its embodiment . This is an attractive picture and one that still prevails in all the textbooks . It would be wrong to say categorically that it has been fundamentally undermined by later scholarship , but it has been severely questioned and rudely challenged . The first dissenters from Pollard 's interpretation approached the problem in what now appears to be a somewhat bizarre fashion . Before the First World War , a group of neo-Catholic historians launched a vehement attack on the assumption that the Reformation was an unmitigated blessing . Was the Reformation beneficent in any way , they asked , or was it only the diabolical work of a selfish , power-mad ruler pursuing his private immoral interests ? They went on to portray the Tudors not as agents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyers of all that was best and most beautiful in English society . The leader in this neo-Catholic offensive was Cardinal Gasquet , an angry and noisy controversialist who published a fiery book abut Henry VIII 's dissolution of the monasteries . The Reformation , he said , was a brutal , shocking , and needless transition from the benevolent medieval community to a mean , grotesque , and immoral society . His thesis created a grand furor and provoked a good deal of teeth-baring among scholars over the proper reading of certain sources . In the 1930 'S Gasquet 's interpretation was T H E E N G L I S H   revived in more subtle and persuasive form by R. W. Chambers , a professor of English literature at the University of London . Chambers ' biography of Sir Thomas More , the chancellor of Henry VIII who preferred martyrdom to breaking with Rome , is the most skillful presentation of the Catholic dissent from the Protestant view of Tudor history . Chambers contends that something rare and wonderful was taking shape in early sixteenth-century England before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , what was coming into existence was a high and rich culture based on the noblest ideals of Christian humanism . A group of intelligent , learned , and devout men , of whom More was the most sensitive and far-seeing , were working to reconstruct the sagging fabric of medieval unity . These men were in the act of transforming a noble vision of an ideal society into reality . For Chambers , More is the tragic hero of sixteenth-century England : man of letters and also of action , chancellor and Christian humanist , statesman and elite reformer , More epitomizes the effort to revive and preserve all that was best in the medieval world . In this light Henry VIII appears as a coarse and blundering villain whose destruction of More ended the possibility of attaining a good society and plunged England into an era of greed and violence . Chambers ' brilliant study of More has been widely applauded as a sensitive apology but his general utopian interpretation of what More could have done for his country has not been accepted . The second attack on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socialist historians . They readily agree that the sixteenth century saw the sudden dawning of the modern world , but they also perceive it as the modern world complete with all its horrors , a capitalist society whose modernity signified exploitation of the working classes . Here Catholics and socialists share a vision : both presuppose a serene medieval community and bewail its destruction by greedy capitalists and ruthless landlords . The underlying thesis in Tawney 's work is that if the Tudors played a role in creating something new , this new and modern society was a social structure built on the backs of the exploited masses . While Pollard assumed an amiable , wholehearted alliance between the crown and landed society , Tawney saw a brief and superficial marriage of convenience which was never based on deep-rooted nationalist feelings . Crafty and aggressive gentry were happy to support the crown as long as the Tudors petted and protected them . From the work of Tawney and his disciples we come away with the disturbing idea that the Tudor monarchy was little more than a flashy facade , that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process , that under the nose of a largely impotent government a great economic and social upheaval was taking place and that the monarchy was really out of touch with the men who counted in society and commanded no deep-rooted or permanent loyalty from the gentry . We know that this thesis is presented in order to make the English civil war of the 1640 's appear as the inevitable bourgeois revolution : the flimsy sixteenth-century alliance disintegrated into a war for the control of society between traditional royal paternalism and the aggressive forces of rising capitalism . Yet there is much in Tawney 's view of Tudor history that makes any subsequent historian of the period stop and re-examine the facile assumption about the existence of a fundamental national union in the sixteenth century . At least we may conclude that the socialist interpretation provides something more provocative and penetrating than the Catholic mourning for a lost golden age that never was . The work of G. R. Elton published in the 1950 's encounters Pollard on his own political grounds and decisively rejects the whole notion that 1485 marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the administrative and legal structure set up by Henry VII was not only the same as that used by Edward IV , but was not even fundamentally different in kind from the government of Edward I at the beginning of the fourteenth century . Elton believes that the government of England in the first and second decades of the sixteenth century may have been operated by a very shrewd and intelligent ruler at a level of efficiency that his predecessors could not quite achieve , but there was nothing really new about it in the way of either institutions or political ideas . There was , however , according to Elton , a revolution in government in the early Tudor period and a start of political modernity . He posits an essential change in political institutions and ideals in the 1530 's , although the revolution that he describes is not entirely congenial to everyone 's concept of a revolution . Elton accepts the old Pollard thesis on Tudor modernity but gives it a disconcerting and startling new twist by moving the date of the revolution from 1485 to 1536 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Tudor kings but Henry VIII 's chief minister , Thomas Cromwell . At this point we have the real beginning of modernity : the idea of sovereignty is clearly conceptualized by Cromwell , and an effective bureaucracy along modern lines is for the first time established .. Elton attaches such great significance to the events of the 1530 's that he sees the ministry of Thomas Cromwell T H E E N G L I S H   as the most important dividing point in English political history between Edward I and the coming of the welfare state in the nineteenth century . Elton 's interpretation and his exposition are very bold and learned , and he is so fully in control of the sources that all his critics ? and they have not been reticent ? look rather feeble in comparison . But his thesis is still not particularly captivating ; it is not very inspiring to think of Thomas Cromwell , hitherto regarded as a social-climbing royal hatchet-man , as the greatest statesman England ever produced , and although scholars have been forced to treat Elton 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholeheartedly the validity of his thesis . His interpretation of Tudor history has gained a widespread but rather reluctant intellectual assent , but it has not been able to win the emotional acceptance from historians necessary for a new interpretation to become the basic assumption on which all future work is predicated . In attempting a reappraisal of Pollard 's view of Tudor history we have to begin by asking if there were any vast and stunning differences between fifteenth- and sixteenth-century English political , religious , and intellectual life . We are still appallingly ignorant about fifteenth-century England , but we do know enough at this point to see that many supposedly sixteenth-century innovations in politics , religion , and culture were not new at all . Historians have always emphasized that the Tudors had spectacular success with conciliar administration and law in central government , such as the use of the Privy Council and the Court of Star Chamber and with the institution of the justices of peace at the county level . But we know that these famous Tudor institutions were in fact already characteristic of fifteenth-century government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Yorkist kings in the 1470 's and 148o 's , and even the earlier Lancastrian administration , infamous for its slovenly and ineffective operation , had essentially the same machinery . In ' terms of the institutional framework there does not seem to be any appreciable difference between the government of 148o and that of 1520 , and we still see much of the same framework even in 1600 . In examining the financial institutions of the Tudor monarchy , the ironic persistence and even conscious revival of medieval traditions becomes even more apparent . The dynasty hailed as modern , anti-medieval , and breaking with the feudal past , has been shown by J. Hurstfield and other scholars to have relied more upon the feudal prerogatives of the crown for royal income than any government since the reign of King John . The Tudors resur- rected with a vengeance the archaic institution of feudal wardship and also sought assiduously to increase the size of the crown lands , thereby freeing the monarchy from financial dependence on the House of Commons . It would be hard to find two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureaucracy than feudal wardship and the royal demesne . We might plausibly argue that the Tudors managed to infuse new life into the old forms , that they revitalized the old institutions with new vision and purpose , and that the robust Tudor wine poured into frail old bottles finally worked the destruction of the bottles themselves . But the use of such metaphors indicates how hard it is to maintain unblemished the Tudor reputation for political modernity . A government which did not develop the institutions of public credit upon which the finances of all modern states depend , which even far less than the rulers of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries relied upon national taxation by consent of Parliament but instead desperately resorted to the expedient of recovering half-forgotten medieval royal prerogatives , at best existed in a kind of twilight world between medieval and modern political life . The close examination of other aspects of life in Tudor England similarly weakens and undermines and occasionally explicitly contradicts the traditional attribute of modernity . There was nothing particularly novel about the Protestant religious doctrines prevalent in sixteenth-century England ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medieval heresies which finally broke through the surface restraints of the old religion and the old authority . It is more useful to ask why this breakthrough did not begin before the 1520 's than to expound its radical newness . What aspects of English government and society kept anti-papal , and anti-sacramental , and anti-sacerdotal ideas under control in the fourteenth century and what allowed them to come to the fore after 1520 ? Until recently this question has scarcely been formulated , but A. G. Dickens ' The English Reformation , by far the best book ever written on the subject , has greatly changed the way historians will henceforth have to think about the origins and significance of Tudor Protestantism . For the first time a well-informed scholar has seriously devoted the early chapters of a study on the English Reformation to finding and explicating Protestant ideas in medieval heresy . Oddly enough this is really a rediscovery ? only four hundred years belated . It is the way many knowledgeable people were thinking in the 1520 's . The bishops at that time T H E E @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new doctrines sounded suspiciously like those of Wyclif and recognized in them a resurgence of Lollardry , an acute perception that historians ought to have respected . The first sentence of F. M. Powicke 's interpretive book on the Reformation , published in the 1930 's , confidently announces that " the English Reformation was an act of the state . " We can no longer see it so simply and unequivocally . There were two Reformations in sixteenthcentury England which , entirely different in origin and character , became inextricably intertwined with one another . The more obvious and easier to study is statist , political , and diplomatic ; it forms the dramatic story of Henry VIII 's break with Rome . But Henry VIII was no more Protestant than the Pope . At the same time there was occurring a popular Reformation , now strengthened and somewhat enriched by continental doctrine , which perpetuated the ideas that had been the stuff of medieval heresy . Nothing about the English Reformation is very clear except that it was not a sharp break with a discarded past but an infinitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the triumph of ideas with deep roots in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries . It has been the common practice for historians to attribute to a small circle of humanist scholars in early sixteenth-century England ? the native Englishmen John Colet and Thomas More , and Erasmus , the famous visiting scholar from the Low Countries ? the formulation of certain ideas which are held to have had a great impact on their contemporaries . Thus the Renaissance is said to have come to England and introduced a new set of intellectual assumptions and attitudes . The ideas popular in the circle of these humanist reformers ? the rejection of Aristotelian in favor of Platonic philosophy , a more personal and emotional manner of approaching religious experience , and severe criticism of the failings of the clergy ? appear indeed to have inaugurated intellectual currents of far-reaching importance . But historians have ignored the lesson which they should have learned from their discovery that some of the adherents and preachers of radical religious doctrines in the 1520 's and 1530 's had been Franciscan friars . What has been attributed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attitudes and doctrines which the Franciscans had been preaching in England for 250 years . This is a problem that still requires intensive study . Perhaps Erasmus and his humanist colleagues developed independently the same ideas which had been circulating in English Franciscan circles since the days of Duns Scotus and William of Ockham ; it is more likely , however , that  | the Renaissance humanists merely contributed the influence of their elo , quence and high social status to anti-clerical , devotional , and quasimystical doctrines that had long been indigenous to the radical wing of the English church itself . Perhaps we shall eventually see the explosive ideas at work in sixteenth-century England not so much as the result of humanist rhetoric or even of the impact of Lutheranism , but rather as the fruit of two centuries of Franciscan teaching . It is at least plausible to maintain that the ever-increasing concern through the Tudor period with an intensely personal religious experience again marks a perpetuation and accentuation of one strand of medieval life and thought . The perpetuation of the medieval thought-world is readily apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study The Elizabethan World Picture E. M. W. Tillyard makes us question the long-held assumption that the higher thought of Tudor England can be considered as inaugurating the modern world , and a somewhat similar thesis is presented in C. S. Lewis ' English Literature in the Sixteenth Century and in Douglas Bush 's The Renaissance and English Humanism . Tillyard , who was strongly under the influence of R. W. Chambers , shows us that the cosmology revealed in Elizabethan literature is still based on the medieval concept of hierarchy . The ideas which the writers of the period express about God , man , and the world , are still presented in terms of the traditional ordered structure , and the prevailing image of the cosmos is still that of the great chain of being . People continue to take these medieval ideas for granted as everyday , commonplace assumptions , and when men come to think and speak about any aspect of life ? about human nature , religion , the state , society , and the universe ? they frame their ideas in terms of a fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines and to justify their conduct by hierarchic doctrine even though what they may actually be doing is contradicting and undermining the medieval world order . Even though sixteenth-century men may at times act in a new and individualistic way , when they explain themselves in the world around them they use the old concepts and the same familiar language . Tillyard 's view of the thought-world of Elizabethan literature is readily confirmed by the concepts which prevail in the writings of practical men . The leaders of Tudor society , no matter how revolutionary their practice , strive to justify their conduct in terms of divine providence , natural law , and a sharply stratified world order . These are the ideas that spring most readily to their minds , and the theoretical allusions which still carry the heaviest weight of meaning . T H E E N G L I S H   Another way of questioning the arrival of the modern world in the sixteenth-century is to examine the commonplace aspects of human life and everyday environment , the daily occurrences and mode of existence that men take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Henry VII or even Elizabeth I is seated on the throne , the style of common life is not much different from that which had prevailed for several centuries . What constantly impresses us in reading the sixteenth-century sources ? whether legal records or literature ? is the continued prevalence of violence . This is not the grand violence of the Wars of the Roses , but it is violence nevertheless . Mayhem , manslaughter , and riots are still constant conditions of everyday life ; rioting is so common that it is used as the judicial pretext for getting cases into Star Chamber , and it was a pretext so ready at hand that lawsuits on almost every possible subject could be impleaded in Star Chamber . In Tudor England everything ? whether a disputed election , a disagreement over landholding , a question of enclosures , or , not least , religious controversies ? seems to end in disturbance of the peace . Everywhere we may look we see fences being ripped down , knives being pulled out , and heads being smashed . Life and property are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life for sixteenth-century people ; in some ways they are not very far from Anglo-Saxon society . And how do people respond and cope with violence and insecurity ? With a deep attachment to order , to political and social conservatism , to the divinely ordained king , to the stable hierarchic view of the world inherited from the medieval period . This feeling is everywhere ; we can see it not only in the political pamphlets and sermons of the period but also clearly enough in Shakespeare 's dramas . Terrible things happen to Shakespeare 's people when they go against the organized structure of the world ; because they destroy order and shatter control they themselves are destroyed . We can not ignore the violent temper of Shakespeare 's tragedies though he is gentle in comparison to the unrelieved gore and psychotic terror of the early seventeenth-century dramatists . The blood feud is still one of the most common themes in literature , and it can be resolved only by the crudest kind of violence , as in Macbeth and Hamlet . Sixteenth-century England remained primarily a pre-industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of the population still lived on the land . Its only metropolis was London , which in 1600 had probably 300,000 people , and no other city in the realm had even one sixth as many . The total population of England in 1600 could   have been very little in excess of three million , only three times greater than the population of England when William the Conqueror invaded the country . In spite of the celebrated woolen industry and expanding overseas commerce , there was no factory system and nothing to compare with the industrial masses of modern society . The royal administration and all local government and law were still overwhelmingly under the control of landed society . The concepts which men used to explain the world to themselves were largely the same ones that had been used in 1300 . In addition a streak of violence ran like a dark thread through everyday life as it had from time immemorial . There is therefore much to be said for the conclusion that Tudor culture and society were still medieval in tone . The attributes of modernity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England have been shown by recent scholarship to be , in many instances , at best highly dubious and at worst totally invalid . Nevertheless , from the time that Edward IV securely gained the throne in 1471 to the death of Elizabeth in 1603 , fundamental and lasting changes in English government and society undoubtedly occurred . The revival of royal power and the restoration of the effective functioning of central government and law are the overriding conditions of these decades . It is necessary , however , to probe more deeply to determine whether this revival of monarchy merely re-established royal power to the point it had reached at the death of Edward I in 1307 or whether there were innovations in political and social institutions and ideas which mark a break with the inherited medieval traditions and provide the conditioning framework of the following two centuries . Many of the celebrated deeds of the captains and kings of late fifteenth-and sixteenth-century England , however dramatic and interesting to behold in themselves , were of no serious consequence for the general history of English government and society . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible to ascertain seven general patterns of change looking forward to the following centuries : ( 1 ) There was a shift in the social basis of politics . Aristocratic political leadership , such as had prevailed in the fourteenth and first three quarters of the fifteenth century , greatly declined , and gentlemen who had neither noble titles nor even unusually great wealth became very important in the royal administration and national politics . ( 2 ) The sovereignty of the national state was established in theory and to some degree in practice as well . Those areas and institutions ? the T H E E N G L I S H  | frontier marches and the church ? which had hitherto been at least partly immune from effective royal control were now subjected , in a sweeping attempt at political rationalization , to the leveling authority of the central government . To put it another way , medieval pluralism began to be subordinated to the aspiration of a sovereign national state , although the effectiveness of this proposed centralization was greatly inhibited by the severe practical limitations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( 3 ) A strenuous effort , which had only a qualified success , was made to improve upon the awkward late medieval household system of royal government by substituting a more public kind of bureaucracy managed by a great minister of the crown under delegated and immediately revocable royal authority . ( 4 ) There was a confused , hesitant , largely pragmatic , and never clearly conceptualized shift from the medieval to the modern idea of legislation , from the assumption that king in Parliament declared , confirmed , and registered prevailing law to the belief that king in Parliament had sovereign authority to make new law for the enhancement of common welfare . ( 5 ) In a half-hearted manner the central government added to its traditional functions of defense and peace the regulation of economic and social life so as to further the interests of the commonweal and to make sure that the poor and unfortunate were given some outside assistance toward attaining a basic sustenance . ( 6 ) In the second half of the sixteenth century the House of Commons becomes not merely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere branch of a sovereign legislature , but a theater for debate on high matters of government and statecraft . ( 7 ) Finally , what is most elusive of all , we glimpse an enhanced sense of the dignity and both moral and rational potentiality of human nature , contributing to greater self-confidence among the leaders of society to make decisions on institutional innovations in both church and state .  | THE RECONSTRUCTION OF GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY from 1471 to 1603 I. Inflation 's Wake IT IS NOT SURPRISING that socialist historians like Tawney should have been attracted to sixteenth-century English history because this is one of the eras when economic change vitally affected politics and society , and therefore the Marxist historian 's commitment to economic determinism takes on some degree of plausibility . From the late thirteenth century to the middle of the fifteenth century , the English economy , both rural and urban , had stagnated , and even in 148o it was only slowly emerging from the long late-medieval depression . This fundamental fact does not , of course , imply that during these two centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in fact a chronic labor shortage aided the manorial peasants in their eventually successful attempts to gain manumission from serfdom , but the later Middle Ages were in general a period of price deflation and population decline . The market for both agricultural and industrial goods was shrinking , trade was poor , and land steadily went out of cultivation . The most obvious difference between Lancastrian and Tudor England was a change in economic conditions . The economic hardships of the fifteenth century , which kid plagued landed society and worried the merchant class , began T H E E N G L I S H   to clear away in the reign of Edward IV , and from about 1500 until the last twenty years of the sixteenth century Englishmen enjoyed the happy experience of a general economic boom , which seemed all the more beneficent because of its stark contrast with life in the Lancastrian period . Prosperity , like depression , was not experienced in an equal degree by all classes in society or even by men and families within the same social group . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixteenth century from rapid market fluctuations , and by and large the condition of the agricultural worker became worse instead of better . But for about one hundred years there were unprecedented opportunities for ambitious men , particularly if they were landlords , to become rich , and the consequent soaring prosperity profoundly affected both the social structure and the policies of the royal government . The fundamental fact of late fifteenth- and sixteenth-century economic life in England as in the rest of western Europe was a steady and , at times , runaway inflation , and one thing that the mysterious science of economics teaches us is that inflation and prosperity usually go hand in hand . At no previous time in European history was there such a precipitous rise in the inflationary curve ; during the first half of the sixteenth century prices in England more than doubled and in 1600 prices were five and a half times what they had been in 1500 . This phenomenal inflation was contemporaneous with a population growth of no more than thirty percent , so that it was not primarily the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise in fact bewildered contemporaries , to whom economic change appeared almost as irrational as changes in the weather , and it was not until the second half of the century that even learned , intelligent , and well-informed men attained a hazy understanding of the factors which had induced this economic revolution . We now know that prices began to rise very slowly in the late fifteenth century in response to population growth and the opening up of new silver mines in Germany , which put a little more money into circulation . But the explosive inflation of the sixteenth century was induced by two other factors , one of them indigenous and the other foreign in origin to the English economy . The first was the misguided and ultimately disastrous debasement of the coinage by the royal government in the 1520 's , 1540 's , and early 1550 's . The second and more important cause of inflation , particularly during the second half of the century , was a flood of specie into Europe from Spanish America via the Ilapsburg territories . The Spanish Haps- burgs used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine , and thus American gold and silver spread all over western Europe and drove prices up at a fantastic rate . Since Antwerp , in the Hapsburg-controlled . Low Countries , became during the first half ' of the sixteenth century the prime English export market , the English economy was immediately affected by price fluctuations at Antwerp as Spanish specie was funneled directly from the Low Countries across the channel . Some economic historians , like J , U. Nef , view the English price rise as a symptom of something more important than these accidental and tangential factors . Citing such changes as the rise of the Lancashire coal industry and an increase in production of the English woolen industry , they see the price rise as part of a so-called first Industrial Revolution in the later sixteenth century . Careful consideration , however , has led to the prosaic conclusion that neither the quality nor the quantity of English industrial production in the sixteenth century gives evidence of any revolutionary or even highly significant change , certainly not enough change , at any rate , to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period . Some new industries did develop in Tudor England , but the expansion of the most promising of these , namely coal production , was greatly limited by a failure to find a satisfactory way of using coal to smelt iron . Coal in the sixteenth century was carried by sea from Newcastle to London and the south , principally for heating use , to compensate for the steady diminution of the once vast English forests , but the process of making coal into the usable form of coke for steel production was not discovered until the eighteenth century . There was an appreciable increase in woolen production but the machinery used was still simple and primitive , and the improvements made in the sixteenth century were not of great importance . In 1600 , unfinished woolen cloth remained as it had been since the later fourteenth century , the chief English export . The cloth industry continued to be organized according to the domestic or " putting out " cottage system of production , and if one entrepreneur possibly did construct something resembling the modern factory , his ingenious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to await eighteenth-century improvements . It is naive to portray a domestic system of production , no matter how well-organized and widespread , as an incipient industrial revolution . If the latter term means anything , it signifies the factory system and the transforming of the industrial workers into an urban proletariat . The woolen workers of T H E E N G L I S H   the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were dispersed in country villages , maintained gardens and small farms , were only part-time employees of the merchant entrepreneurs who controlled the woolen industry , and were not completely dependent on their income from industrial production . This certainly does not look like the Industrial Revolution . The sixteenth-century English wool magnates failed to use the factory system not because it was unknown or because they were too conservative or obtuse to effect an industrial revolution , but rather because they had no desire for greatly increased productivity . Since the nineteenth century the challenge faced by the capitalist entrepreneur has been to increase production ; if he can produce more , better , and cheaper goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the circumstances created by modern technology , distribution is no problem and is equally available to all producers . The critical problem faced by all capitalist industrial entrepreneurs before the transportation revolution of the later eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was just the opposite of that of their modern counterparts , and England 's insular position made this a particularly difficult matter for the men who controlled the Tudor woolen industry . There was no point in expanding production when transportation technology remained so primitive and precarious , and international distribution of goods therefore so expensive that despite the price inflation the size of the foreign market was severely limited . The decadeby-decade increase of the English population during the sixteenth century sufficed to absorb only a modest increase at home in woolen production , and the built-in defects of the export system across the channel similarly allowed only a small expansion of the Flemish market . It is not surprising that under these conditions the Tudor entrepreneurs were far from eager to allow uncontrolled production and market competition ; they were in fact monopolistic and protection-minded , in marked contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have produced more but they could not profitably distribute and sell the surplus abroad . Hence they constantly urged the crown to give them a corporate monopoly which would keep out new producers and protect the limited market . It is painfully evident that the whole European economy , the English included , suffered from a crippling distribution problem from the fourteenth to the eighteenth centuries , and until this was overcome there could be no Industrial Revolution . It is also apparent that economic stagnation was a constant threat to this defective economic system . The hundred years ' spurt between the late   fifteenth and late sixteenth centuries was not the dawn of modern capitalism . Rather , it was an anomalous and short-lived economic situation . When the magic effect of American specie wore off in the last decade of the century , deflation again set in , the endemic depression reappeared , and after 1600 we again hear bitter complaints from both landlords and merchants . The inflationary boom of the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was , thcrefore , a peculiar interlude in the chronically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and early eighteenth centuries . Its uniqueness makes it all the more important . This era of prosperity provided unusual opportunities for entrepreneurial endeavor , especially in agriculture , an activity that in turn stimulated far-reaching social changes to which the royal government was forced to adjust . The new prosperity of the late fifteenth century engendered an expanding market for agricultural produce . The small farmers and peasants were apparently first to take advantage of this situation . Prices for grain and wool rose steadily and men who owned their own farms or held land on fixed rents were making impressive profits , even if their holdings were small . By the 1480 's , however , the landlords themselves , particularly if they were enterprising and rational , were cognizant of the new opportunities , and for the next hundred years propertied men in search of profit did everything they could to capitalize on the steady demand for grain , meat , and wool in an inflationary market . The movement toward capitalist agriculture took two forms : first , the landlords set out to rationalize the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquire more land . The first step in the rationalization of prevailing resources was the attempt to transform traditional fixed rents paid by copyholders and other kinds of tenant farmers into short-term leases so that rents could be raised to keep pace with rising prices . Goaded by the demand for meat and wool , which was insatiable in the first half of the sixteenth century , more enterprising and aggressive landlords went further . They sought to enclose the old open fields and common pasturages , which were vestiges of the medieval manorial economy , and to turn their estates into vast sheep-runs whose wool and mutton fetched huge profits in the inflationary market . This late fifteenth- and sixteenth-century enclosure movement was partly inhibited by the desperate resistance of the threatened tenant farmers . He royal government , always spurred by fears that extensive dispossession of the peasantry would lead to social disorder and T H E E N G L I S H   thus inspire rebellion against the crown , also hindered the enclosure movement , though with intermittent and usually half-hearted prohibitions . The dearth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent of enclosure in the sixteenth century . It is now generally believed that not more than five percent of the agricultural land of England was enclosed before 1600 , but in a few counties where the land was particularly suitable for sheep-raising , the figure may be as high as twenty-five percent . Enclosure certainly created grave social problems which forced the royal government for the first time in English history to regard the relief of the poor and unemployed as one of its functions . The prosperity enjoyed by those landlords who were willing and able to practice the new capitalist agriculture provoked an insatiable demand for more land among the rural entrepreneurs . Their greed and energy drove them to look longingly upon the vast estates held by the monasteries . Some landlords had long drawn substantial income as secular managers of monastic estates , but they too were caught up in the inflationary hysteria of the sixteenth century and , just as they raged against the fixed rents and dues of their tenants , so the landlords were no longer satisfied with a limited profit even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these circumstances the dissolution of the monasteries by the Tudor crown in the 1530 's was bound to be vehemently approved by nearly all the leaders of rural society . The sale of monastic lands by the crown from the 1540 's to the end of the century became , therefore , the chief means of appeasing the land-hunger in rural society . The monasteries had held perhaps half of the best agricultural land in England , which was now subject to exploitation for the market , and yielded immense profits to those who had successfully bid for these prized estates . The combined effect of enclosure and secularization of monastic property was the inauguration of a radical change in the face of rural England ; in the extensively enclosed areas it assumed an appearance which it retained at least until the nineteenth century , and which it still has in many rural counties of south-central and eastern England at the present day . The unfenced open fields and commons were now encircled by the green hedges of merry England , and the new dominant position of the entrepreneurial landlords was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which were , in fact , refurbished monastic houses . Novel economic conditions provided unprecedented opportunities for men of middling and even modest provenance to rise high in county   society . Not again until the Industrial Revolution of the late eighteenth century would the qualities of energy and daring combined with rational allocation of resources and the absence of moral scruples ? in other words , the qualities we associate with the capitalist entrepreneur ? bring such immediate reward in England . Some of those who did well in this expanding economy were younger sons of the nobility , who had the initial advantages of family wealth and prominence ; others were men who were given preference by the crown because they were faithful servants or court favorites . But many who rose to great wealth and at least provincial importance during the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were men who made their own way in the world and triumphed in a society that was relatively open and freely competitive in comparison with the rural England of the later Middle Ages . Yet it would be a grave error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the exercise of rational planning and greed by upwardly mobile capitalist gentry ; this mistake has frequently been made by Marxist historians . The term " gentry " in the sixteenth century simply meant the gentlemen , and it may be applied to a very large and heterogeneous group that includes as much as twenty percent of the population of England . " Gentry " is a very supple word , and it stretches all the way from a flamboyant younger son of the nobility to a petty landlord domiciled in a very modest manor house eking out a living from the rents of three or four tenants . " As for gentlemen , they be made good cheap in England , " writes the commentator Sir Thomas Smith in 1551 . " For whosoever studieth the laws of the realm , who studieth in the universities , who professeth liberal sciences and , to be short , who can live idly and without manual labour , and will bear the port , charge and countenance of a gentleman . . . shall be taken for a gentleman . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circumstances of the sixteenth-century boom , and those able to take full advantage of the new economic conditions formed a small minority . Certainly there were as many among the landlords of Tudor England who failed to adjust to the new conditions and whose status and income remained static , or even deteriorated , as there were those who possessed the necessary qualities to rise high in the county society . Nevertheless the fact remains that by the second half of the sixteenth century every county of England had a group of newly important gentry stemming from families that only one hundred years before had been impoverished knights , simple yeoman farmers , or urban merchants or lawyers . One of T H E E N G L I S H   the fundamental conditions of Tudor history was the prominent place in the county enjoyed by men who gained their superior status neither from aristocratic descent nor through royal favor , but rather from their economic success , a social fact attested to by the scramble to hold the coveted and prestigious offices of county life ? sheriff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not yet fully unraveled the intricate and often obscure relationship between politics and social change in the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries , although this is obviously a subject of the greatest importance . The surface manifestations of late fifteenth- and sixteenthcentury social politics are easy enough to describe . From the reign of Edward II to that of Edward IV ? that is , from 1307 to 1471 ? politics and government were dominated by the aristocracy . Dukes and earls who owned vast estates also maintained huge private armies and swarms of dependents and retainers . The aristocrats were the most important people in military life and in politics ; it was only natural that they should also control the House of Commons and use it in their maneuvers to gain leverage against the royal council , and from there to carry out their designs on the crown itself . But in the later years of Edward IV 's reign aristocratic leadership in politics was rapidly disappearing , and certainly for 175 years from the time that Henry Tudor gains the throne in 1485 , the aristocracy does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During these two centuries people with high titles of nobility , inex haustible resources , and an aristocratic style of life and habit of mind cease to dominate political life . Only at a few exceptional moments do aristocrats meddle in politics , and even then , while they momentarily become the center of controversy , they achieve very little aside from notoriety . During the fourteenth and most of the fifteenth centuries the House of Commons was the tool of aristocratic factions , but in the course of the two centuries after 1471 the hold of great lords over the M.P . ' s is no longer an important aspect of the political scene . The very few peers who do wield any influence during this period owe their power to a personal relationship with the king or queen and to prominence at court . They no longer have , in their own right , any real control of the House of Commons . From the late fifteenth century the House of Commons was dominated by independent gentlemen who were rarely allied with great families . In the fourteenth- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were capable of creating a certain amount   of noise , but it is perfectly obvious that they were dependents of great lords . The sixteenth-century House of Commons looks as though it were under the sway of new men , gentry of means and reputation who have already gained prominence in their counties as J.P . ' s and sheriffs and who , while they may have done well in capitalist agriculture , can not call upon the unending resources of the old aristocracy . The new and central role of these men on the parliamentary stage has led historians to see clearly ? perhaps too clearly ? the political rise of the gentry . Perhaps ten or twenty percent of the sixteenth-century M.P . ' s owed their allegiance to certain members of the Privy Council and constituted a court faction or steering group in the Commons ; the rest were genuinely independent gentlemen , and factions committed to one or another great aristocratic family no longer appear in the House of Commons . The problem for the crown and the Privy Council was to win over the independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found easy to do until the later decades of the sixteenth century . The king and his ministers no longer had to worry that groups in the Commons were manipulated by dukes and earls bent on seizing control of the royal government and usurping the crown itself . Not only has the aristocracy withdrawn from the leadership of the House of Commons , but the political importance of their stronghold , the House of Lords itself , has markedly declined as well . No Tudor monarch found it hard to get legislation through the upper house , nor did the Commons , except in moments of greatest crisis , pay the lords much heed . For about sixty years , from 1471 to 1529 , Parliament was not often summoned by the crown , and political decision-making was the province of the royal council . After 1529 , when it seemed necessary to obtain statutory confirmation for religious and ecclesiastical changes , Parliament again became central to political life and henceforth the decisions of the lower house are the crucial ones . The Privy Council took pains to secure the Commons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also readily bowed to royal leadership . In the wider context of English history the political decline of the aristocracy was only temporary , for in the late seventeenth century aristocratic leadership came back with a vengeance , and from then until the end of the nineteenth century the great noble families did not relinquish their hold on government , nor have they entirely relaxed their grip in the twentieth century . Nevertheless the general abdication of aristocratic leadership for almost two centuries is an astonishing historical phenomenon which inevitably had ramifications on the social framework of poli-T H E E N G L I S H   tics from the late fifteenth to the late seventeenth century . Tawney and his disciples have claimed that the price revolution and the expansion of the market which gave the gentry such great opportunities also made life irremediably difficult for the aristocracy . In the face of the rapidly changing economy , their thesis runs , only men with the canny bourgeois temperament that insured success in capitalist agriculture could survive and prosper . Only the group of alert middle class landowners adjusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to economic drift and caught up in their old , courtly , extravagant ways , were left far behind . The undermining of the aristocracy went hand in hand with the rise of a group of entrepreneurs who , having stunningly applied reason to economics , proceeded with equal success to apply rationality to politics . Tawney 's thesis has been found rigid , simplistic , and inaccurate by later scholars who can not accept his Marxian class categories . Elton has refused to acknowledge that any problem of aristocratic decline exists . It is just not possible , he believes , to separate the gentry from the high aristocracy . Titles are misleading and very insignificant in the sixteenth century ; it only mattered to be a gentleman , and the gentry formed a vast and amorphous group . There were so many landowners , and their resources were as varied and divergent as the extent of their political involvement , that it is wrong to think of them in terms of an identifiable , self-conscious , or cohesive class . Even an earldom may not denote any particular mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gentry , for the possession of an aristocratic title in the sixteenth century frequently means only that the holder of the title has been a loyal Privy councillor or a court favorite . Neale 's interpretation is similar . Society and politics were dominated by one ubiquitous landowning class . Some gentry were very important politically ; others , although they resembled this elite group in almost all aspects , were lesser men . In every county political and judicial leadership was exercised by two or three families who , by virtue of wealth , crown favor , tradition , or simply extraordinary energy , filled up the county offices . Titles were a minor index ' of power-holding , and many men who were simply knights dominated their counties as much or more than holders of aristocratic titles . In Neale 's view , the fundamental fact of Tudor social politics was an alliance and basic agreement between the crown and the great county families , and the community of interest and political consensus that prevailed among these families . It is true that in the sixteenth century we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
