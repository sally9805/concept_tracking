txt Greville Wynne-whose harrowing real-life experiences in Russian hands recall the plots of such thrillers of fiction as " The Spy Who Came in from the Cole  --  told yesterday how he went to Budapest in Nov .. 1962. on a business trip and was kidnaped and taken to prison in Moscow . The prison was medieval . His guards were harsh . One day , while being taken back to his cell from one of the endless , bewildering interrogation sessions , he was pushed up to a cell spyhole and told to look in . He saw his Russian friend Penkovsky , who had wanted badly to defect to the west . This is Part 3 . By Greville Wynne OLEG Penkovsky looked terrible when I saw him thru the spyhole of his cell in the Lubyanka prison in Moscow . But I could not fail to recognize him . He was almost the same age as me . His birthday was on March 28 , 1919 , my birthday was on the 19th . We were almost the same height , the same build . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variety of subjects . He had a sense of humor . He liked vodka , he liked wine , he liked spirits , but he would hardly drink at all in business hours . I never saw him drunk . He was always very much alert . He had a military bearing and was probably an inch taller than me , about 5 feet , 9 inches . He walked very quickly , was very keen on his health , and took a lot of exercise . He was always asking how he looked , and he was very upset because he was slightly bald ? he used to try all sorts of tonics which he could n't get in Russia . He liked the company of women . Penkovsky told me that he had been brought up under the communist system , had become an active communist party member , was recruited into the Red army , a n d served as an artillery officer in the Japanese Manchurian , Finnish , and German wars . He had become a colonel at the age of 30 . His father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revolution . His Eyes Were Opened in Istanbul Penkovsky had married a general 's daughter , and after his military career he became a full-time member of the state security organization and an intelligence officer of the reserve army . The Russians went to great lengths to deny this to me , and told me that if I mentioned this in court or at any other time later , they would make much trouble for me . Penkovsky had shown me and other people in the west official cards and documents identifying him as a member of military intelligence . That is why he joined the technical-science committee . It was purely a method of meeting western delegations , keeping tabs on them , and picking western brains . He told me his eyes were opened when he went to Istanbul as assistant military attache in 1947 . It was the first time he bad been out of Russia . After the war a lot of Russians like him , particularly in the army , did not necessarily want capitalism in an American sense  --  what they wanted was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude . He was a member of the Communist party . He said he did not want to give the impression that he was turning against the Russian people , against his country . But a lot of his friends , some of them in very high places , were feeling the same way . After Stalin they expected changes to take place much more quickly , but the economy of the country was being drained for soldiers and guns and military equipment . A Strange List of Visitors There was not the slightest doubt in my mind that Penkovsky was genuine , and I am prepared from what I know about other things to believe that people in high places badly want a more liberal and sensible way of life . In a way , he was the top of an iceberg ; there are lots like him below the surface . When I left Moscow in Dec. , 1960 , with that first delegation of British businessmen whose firms I represented , it had been agreed in principle that a Russian delegation would pay a return visit to England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s delay , so I agreed with my companies to go to Moscow again to try to finance the program . Penkovsky was there to meet me . " Now Mr. Wynne , " he said , " you have come because there is some delay in the delegation . Well we have a delegation , I have a delegation , and I am coming to England . " I asked who the delegation members were , and he gave me a list . " Prof. -- - , who is he ? " I asked . " Ah , the Professor . He is in Moscow now . He looks after radar , and he is interested of course in Jodrell Bank . " " Well Mr. Penkovsky , I am not selling Jodrell Bank . And who is this --  --  --  " " He also is in Moscow at the moment . He is interested in computers . " " But I am not representing any companies with computers . " To cut a long story short , there was only one man of the eight he had got who represented a firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " I ca n't accept this delegation as they do not represent the interests and equipment of the companies I represent . You are expected to come to look at the equipment which I am selling " Penkovsky Tells Real Reasons Then Penkovsky said , " Please Mr. Wynne , I beg you , I can not explain , but I must come to England . If you make trouble for me I can not come . Maybe they will send another delegation if you make trouble , but then I will not come . " " I would like you to come , " I said , " but what difference does it make ? This is business . " And then he told me for the first time a little of his hopes and fears for his country , and of the plans for the future that he and his friends had dreamed of . So I agreed to Penkovsky 's list , and I had to tell my companies that this delegation was not really what they expected . That It was an investigating delegation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to report back . Of course I knew what Penkovsky really wanted to do in England : I accepted his useless delegation with my eyes open , just so as to enable him to come quickly to the west and make contact with British and American intelligence . Penkovsky subsequently did make contact with agents of both countries . lie was tried with Wynne and the Russians announced he had been shot . I had one advantage besides : I had by then had several years of experience of east European countries and their people and their way of life , and I bad some notion of the anguish that many of them were suffering , because I had seen it at first hand . So I was caught up with Penkovsky simply because I was there . I happened to be the right person in the right place at the right time . And I believe that most British businessmen with my experience would have done the same .
