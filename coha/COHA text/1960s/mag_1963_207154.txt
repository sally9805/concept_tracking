In the 13 months since Comedian Ernie Kovacs died in an automobile crash , no one in show business has been busier than his widow Edie Adams . She was left with an enormous , unspecified debt that Ernie owed the Government . Their joint production company also owed the American Broadcasting Company almost $125,000 in unpaid production charges for old Kovacs TV shows . Her pressagent claims that she could have gone into bankruptcy ; instead , she went to work . She has done movies , TV appearances , commercials-anything and everything to help pay off the debts that Ernie left behind . <P> Spine Tingler . " There are some things Edie wo n't do , but nothing she ca n't do , " said Groucho Marx , introducing her present show at a hotel on the Las Vegas strip . This statement could only be half right , since Edie does have her limitations . She is no Judy Garland . But nonetheless she is an above-average singer who is also an amusing comedienne and a pretty , been-around blonde with a spooky resemblance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , that she has had to drop Marilyn from her repertory of impressions ( Jeanette MacDonald , Shirley Temple , Ethel Merman , Marlene Dietrich , Elizabeth Taylor ) . Often she looks enough like MM anyway to make spines tingle all the way out to the gaming tables . <P> " Actually , " she tells her audience , " I 'm here on missionary work for the Tax Department . " She wears , at times , a skintight gown with a huge rose of ribbon on her derriere . She runs her hands down her sides . " It 's about the size of one leg of Jackie Gleason 's trousers , " she confides . Then she 's off into song , with an impression thrown in-of Elizabeth Taylor , for example , singing I Cai n't Say No . <P> Pop Goes the Money . No epic hero would strap himself to a mast upon hearing this sort of thing , but it is good entertainment and it pays the bills . Edie made a little more than $150,000 last year and should do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies already completed ( It 's a Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World and Call Me Bwana ) , and two more about to be filmed ( The Yum Yum Tree and Very Important Persons ) . She has also been offered the lead in a production of South Pacific that is planned for Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera House next autumn . <P> For a 33-year-old widow with three daughters to look after ( two are step-daughters ) , she brings home a fair chunk of sugar-cured bacon . But she always has . She was sister Eileen in Wonderful Town , and she won a Tony award as Daisy Mae in Broadway 's Li'l Abner . Early in her show business experience , she was taught how to go for the green . As a dappled-taffy blonde out of rural Pennsylvania , Tenafly , N.J. , and the Juilliard School of Music , she appeared on Arthur Godfrey 's Talent Scouts years ago , hoping to win the evening with a long-hair practice number selected from a Juilliard textbook . " If you sing that , you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But you 're a beautiful girl . If you sing a pop song , you 'll lose , but you will get all kinds of job offers . " That 's what she did-and she was off on the nightclub circuit .
