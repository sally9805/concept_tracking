For nearly a month , Greece has been gripped by a bitter and highly significant struggle . On one side were the hard-lining former military officers , who sought to perpetuate their rigidly moralistic rule . Pitted against them were the more moderate revolutionary leaders , who favored an eventual return to some form of parliamentary government . After a series of shifts and political maneuvers , it is finally clear that the moderates , led by Premier George Papadopoulos , have emerged the winners . Their victory signaled the start of a new chapter in Greece 's post-revolutionary development . <P> The showdown had been brewing for some time . In the days following the April 1967 revolution , Papadopoulos was the favorite of the hardliners . They became increasingly disillusioned with him after he encouraged the drafting and promulgation of a constitution that ultimately would bring back exiled King Constantine and put the junta out of business . The breaking point came late last month , when Papadopoulos overruled a decision by his fellow military officers and stayed the execution of Alexandros Panaghoulis , a 30-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Premier 's life . <P> Downgrading the Military . Papadopoulos then moved swiftly against his antagonists . In a series of deft maneuvers , he transferred several leading hardliners . Most notable : ex-Colonellonnis Ladas , who lost his post as chief of the country 's internal security system . Isolated from their former colleagues in the army , the hard-liners had no alternative but to bow to the Premier 's orders . Consolidating his control over the Greek military , Papadopoulos appointed Lieut . General Odysseus Anghelis , a reliable career officer , to the newly created post of Chief of the Armed Forces . <P> Meanwhile , Papadopoulos began a campaign to put the revolutionary council , the junta 's shadowy ruling body , out of business . In conducting affairs of state , he ignored the council , instead sought ratification of his programs from the civilian-dominated Cabinet . Government censors allowed two Athens papers to report that the revolutionary council no longer existed . <P> As if to buttress that contention , the chief government spokesman emphasized at a press conference that all government power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as prescribed in the new constitution that was overwhelmingly ratified last September . Papadopoulos appointed a commission of jurists and civil servants to draw up the 25 or so laws that are needed to implement the precepts of the constitution . In a nationwide radio address , Papadopoulos promised to ease the country 's rigid revolutionary rule and to introduce extensive social re forms . The thrust of his actions in dicated that the initial military phase of the revolution had ended and that Phase 2 , which would be political in nature , had now begun .
