For all the world attention they get , British abstract expressionists might as well be painting on another planet . The British public might even suspect that it 's one of those things that is n't done . But it is done-and sometimes pretty well . <P> A whole generation of British artists , bowing distantly to Paris , but taking more cues from New York , is achieving a specific British combination of emotion and sensibility . Sometimes the paintings evoke the grime of cities whose burdens are overpowering . At other times the warm freshness of nature overwhelms the painters ' defenses , leaving a happy glow . The style tends to be neater and less vigorous than the American . More than fellow abstractionists elsewhere , the British acknowledge and reflect a debt to more conventional artists , such as the 19th century 's Constable and Turner , and to contemporaries like Ben Nicholson and Graham Sutherland .

" Now a Cornwall man like Lanyon , he says : " I 've got a feeling I 'm losing the landscape . I 'm getting nearer and nearer to pure abstract painting . I want conflict and contrast . " <P> <P> Ivon Hitchens , 68 . Capturing the jagged sense of natural creation . Hitchens-whose first paintings were infant dabbles on the back of his artist father 's canvases - looks to landscapes for the music of his spheres . He prefers to work outdoors , goes musical in trying to explain why . " Vision , emotion and memory orchestrate one sound . " he says .
