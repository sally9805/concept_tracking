 | My Son and I were strangers ? until the day I learned that love @# is of the head as well as of the heart It was while I was packing Johnny 's trunk for his first year at prep school that I became painfully , almost agonizedly aware that my first-born was a boy I scarcely knew . I saw him then as a loose-jointed , nice-looking youngster with a secret life , an inner world completely hidden from my eyes . Oh , I 'd suspected our remoteness from each other for a long time ; but that day , among his private belongings , it became a heartbreaking reality , and it seemed it was too late then for me to do anything about it . It was n't that I did n't love this familiar stranger , but it was an anxious , uneasy sort of love . In retrospect , I know it was a most possessive sort of love , and this was the neartragic barrier between us , although I did n't know that then . Tod , my husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Look , honey , " I remember saying to him , " all the song sheets from the past two years , Conrad , William Blake , and sixty-five hot-rod magazines . He 's an enigma , Tod . I do n't feel 1 know him at all . Do you ? " Tod leaned down and , smelling of shaving lotion , kissed me .. " Sometimes , " he said . " Maybe that 's enough , " I answered quietly , wanting somehow more than that . I had always wanted more than that ? of my husband , my children , my parents , my sisters , my dearest friends . To know them really and to be known by them ... . Before Tod left , he picked up a volume entitled An Almanac of Baseball Facts and put it into the trunk , side by side with Coming of Age in Samoa . " The complete boy , " he said , smiling . " Good-by , ( Continued on page 194 )  | Anne . Hope you have a happy day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jay ? a busy , somewhat backbreaking , very happy day . That was the day I learned what it really means to love ? not only one 's child , but all the inhabitants of one 's world . And my understanding came from an unexpected source . . . . Some of the going was dull that day . I remember weeding out clothes that did n't have name tapes or that were obviously outgrown . Doing these mindless tasks , I found my thoughts going back over the years to the time Johnny eluded me . In the beginning , of course , he had been just like his younger brother and sister ? Bill and Mimi ? blurting out his every thought . " Do n't goldfish in a dark pool remind you of stars in the sky , sort of ? " ... " Do you know , sometimes you give me the most @# terrible pain , and sometimes 1 love you so much ' ? Are you two different people . or am I ? " When did they stop ? those intimate exchanges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . Riding in the car with him , silent , beside me , I would try in those days to reach out to him . " You 're so quiet . sweetie . Are you all right ? " " Sure , " he 'd tell me . " I 'm just thinking . " Or , sulkily sometimes , " Is there anything so awful about being quiet ' ? " I did n't ask him what he was thinking . AFTER that summer , there was a strange sort of shyness between us . Before then , Johnny would sprawl all over the house , long legs draped over chair backs in the living room or dangling over a side as he sat on the washing machine in the kitchen . But now he @# @# : ND  | confined himself to his room . He bought a lock for the door ? " to keep my stuff away from the kids " ? and there he hid himself , playing the record player he 'd bought with his grandfather 's birthday check , talking endlessly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heaven knows , while driving back and forth to the dentist , back and forth to baseball prac:ice , to dancing school , to Joan 's house . Joan was Johnny 's girl ? little and Monde , with hair that always looked newly washed and with a sweetness about her that was something rare and wonderful . There was plenty of time to talk , but no easy way of getting started on anything but trivia . Nothing was said about Johnny 's interior life . A few times when I asked him about his philosophy , his beliefs , he just shut up . NOW that I look back , just one time in the past three years did I really communicate with Johnny . On his fifteenth birthday he asked if Joanie could come to dinner and if they could go to the movies afterward ; this seemed a fine idea to Tod and me . When dinner was ready , I called the children to the table . The little ones came flying , but there was no sign of Johnny and Joan . The door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there I found them , stretched out on Johnny 's bed . They did n't spring up guiltily when they saw me . Johnny lifted himself up on one elbow , his young face blurred in the half-light of the April dusk . " Have you been calling us ? " he asked . Joanie sat up then , cross-legged , her red skirt tucked under her knees . " Gosh , I 'm sorry . We did n't hear you , Mrs. Cunningham . " I did n't say anything . Nothing in my experience had prepared me for this . " I love this room , " Joan was saying softly , " with all Johnny 's things in it . Even the awful smell of his old baseball glove is nice because it 's his . I love the books he reads and the models he makes ? " She laughed ? a gentle , womanly little laugh . Johnny said , " Oh , shut up ! How could one fat , little , old girl be so darned corny ? " They both got up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were very quiet , waiting , waiting , and still I could n't seem to find my voice . There was such a freshness , an innocence about them . I could n't bear to turn their lovely moment into something ugly or wrong by scolding them . And yet . . . and yet .. . I sat down on the bed and put an arm around each of them , wanting very , very much not to muff this . Let me at least teach them this one thing , I kept thinking , this thing I 'd been lucky enough to have had Tod teach me . " In spite of what you see in the movies or read in books , my darlings , " I began , " making love is just one little part of any truly satisfying relationship between a boy and a girl or between a man and a woman . " I stopped and looked at them , two children on the brink of maturity , their listening faces still new and unformed . It sounds so preachy , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deeper place in myself from which I could speak with some authority of my own , not simply mouthing words I 'd read and heard a thousand times . I found the place ; but it was a very quiet place , full of love , and I could n't find a single word to say . There 'll be time later , I thought , for a practical and detailed conversation . But not tonight . Not this beautiful , starfilled , unforgettable night . . . . Out in the dining room the kids were yelling for their dinner . As I started toward the door , Joanie came over to me and squeezed my arm . " You understood that this was a special time , did n't you ? " she said softly . her little-girl voice very earnest . " Thank you for not yelling at us . " Johnny just said , " Thanks , " in a funny , rough voice , and I knew we had spoken to each other deeply . THAT was more than a year before , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , college , marriage . And somehow ? save for that lone evening ? I had missed the boat as a mother , had failed to make myself known to him or ever really to find him . I stopped at noon for a sandwich and a glass of milk , grateful that the youngsters were away visiting for the day . I could stick to my chores . By three , the trunk was closed ? name tapes on all the clothes and an inventory of everything in it neatly typed and put away . There remained only the cleaning up . Johnny had given me permission to throw out anything I wanted except what he 'd put in a brown cardboard box marked " Treasures . " I got rid of reams of old schoolwork papers , marked variously " Very untidy , " " This shows considerable merit , " " Spelling ! " and " See me ! " I also threw away sheafs of building passes from his threeyear junior-high-school career : " Reason for pass : to boys ' room . " ( Or " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field for game , " or " To nurse for aspirin . " ) Johnny , Johnny ? the story of your life . I threw out a long , partially filled-in health questionnaire that had come from a company dealing in bar bells and other weight-lifting devices . " Are you troubled with any of the following ? Insomnia ? no . Dizziness ? no . Headaches ? some . Impotence ? no . " Johnny , my dear . Then there were some old campaign buttons from student-council elections and a card from a baseball star , thanking Johnny for a fan letter . I was just about through . A few more papers to dispose of , and the desk would be clear . I held the final scrap of paper in my hand . In Johnny 's round , childish hand were a number of notations . " 1 . I have regretted my speech but never my silence ' ? Plato . ( Plato can go to hell ? but not really . He 's right. ) " 2 . In quietness . . . shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music , hacking , etc. , gives me a pain after a while . Joanie is nice to be quiet with. ) " 3 . Love is of God . . . . He that @# @#  | loveth not knoweth not God ; for God is love ' ? John . ( I ca n't really understand this completely , but I believe this. ) " 4 . The one essential thing is that vtie strive to have light in ourselves . . . When people have light in themselves it will shine out from them . Then we get to know each other as we walk together in the darkness without needing to pass our hands over each other 's faces or to intrude into each other 's hearts ' ? Al Schweitzer . Joan has some light . I do n't have any yet , I do n't think . " Al Schweitzer , I thought tenderly , my heart very full . Al Schweitzer . I read the page several times , especially the fourth quotation , which seemed to be meant especially for me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was finished . I looked around the small , friendly room , so unnaturally tidy . The end of an era . I closed the door , feeling tears on my face . Johnny was standing in the hallway , looking out the door at the late flowers . Yellow and white chrysanthemums , a final blooming of the delphinium , the dauntless little marigolds . I went up to him , and I said , " Hello . Johnny , " and he turned , his blue eyes dark and fathomless . " The world is sad today , " he said in a faraway voice . " I do n't know why . " " I feel that way too sometimes . " " When I feel that way , I want to be with Joan . I think I 'll ride my bike over there now . " " If only we could take each other 's loneliness away , " I said , finding it easy to talk to him . " But we ca n't , Johnny . Not even your father and I ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered soberly . " We 're individual human beings , of course . But we can share our loneliness , ca n't we ? Like ? like a good joke or a kiss ? " He was looking at me with no self-consciousness . HAD the self-consciousness of the past years been all in me ? I wondered suddenly . Had I been striving for something I had no right to possess of him and missing what might have been mine ? this wordless understanding in his eyes , mutual wonder at life 's ultimate mystery , the sharing of this moment ? " I do n't know that I ever thought of it that way . Of course , we can share it , " I said . As I held the words within me , they struck a deep and joyous meaning for me . I said it again . " Of course , we can share it , " and I felt an old weight lift from me . I kissed his soft cheek . " Thank you , " he said a little formally , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling on his old blue baseball cap . I watched him get on his bike , his widening shoulders tapering into a narrow waist , and my throat hurt , but my heart sang . My dear , I thought , you 're quite a man , and I love you , whatever you are . The end of an era , I thought again , watching him to the turn of the drive and out of sight . Yes , I thought , the end of an era , but the beginning of a new one for both of us . THE END
