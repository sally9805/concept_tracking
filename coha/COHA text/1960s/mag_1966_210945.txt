At The Hague last week , Finance Ministers and central bankers from ten nations paused during a two-day conference on international monetary problems for a banquet at Het Prinsenhof , the royal residence of William of Orange . Presiding as host , Dutch Finance Minister Anne Vondeling toasted his colleagues with an old French proverb : " Point n'est besoin d'esperer pour entreprendre ni de russir pour persvrer One need not hope in order to undertake , nor succeed in order to persevere . " Next day , by a 9-1 vote , with France 's Michel Debr the only holdout , Ministers of the Group of Ten agreed to persevere some more . <P> Enough ? The ten are the U.S. , Britain , Japan , Canada , Italy , West Germany , Holland , Belgium and Sweden , with Switzerland a nonvoting participant . Among them , they hold 80% of the world 's gold and do most of its international trade . For nearly three years , they have been pondering whether enough gold and reserve currencies ( the dollar and the pound ) are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The interminable discussions polarized the group into two blocs . Continentals , suspicious that reform was being urged in order to help the U.S. and Britain ease their own money troubles , urged both to solve their balance-of-payments problems before other action is taken . <P> <P> U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Fowler took another tack . Contingency planning , he said , should begin as soon as possible and involve poor nations as well as rich . By last week 's vote , the Ten agreed not only to continue seeking some kind of reform but also to broaden deliberations by including the 20-member executive board of the International Monetary Fund . Half the board is drawn from Group of Ten nations , but the other members represent African , Arab , Asian and Latin American countries , which will now be able to insert poor-nation needs and notions into the debate and perhaps break the longtime deadlock . <P> Yankee Optimism . The vote was a victory for the U.S. , but only of a procedural kind . Still to be decided is the question of which reforms should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as divided as ever . One European bloc , including West Germany , Italy and Holland , is in favor of creating a new kind of money , dubbed the " cru " ( for composite reserve unit ) , which would take its place along with the dollar and the pound in the reserves of the world 's central banks . Belgium and Switzerland opt instead for merely increasing the borrowing rights that 103 nations already have with the International Monetary Fund . Other nations , including the U.S. , would agree to a combination of the two plans . <P> Secretary Fowler , with Yankee optimism , predicted last week that , with proper give and take , monetary reform could be accomplished by 1968.
