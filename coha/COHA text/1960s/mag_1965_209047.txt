Even more than tenors who try to upstage her , Diva Joan Sutherland dislikes reporters who crowd her . Last week La Stupenda , as her fans call her , hit a low note in her relations with the press . <P> Arriving at Sydney airport for her first concert in her native city in 14 years , she was distressed to see that photographers were waiting . Commanded the coloratura : " Get those people away from here . " Her husband-manager , Richard Bonynge , followed with a back handed swing at a photographer 's camera and smashed the flashbulb . <P> <P> Later , Joan and husband showed up at a Sydney restaurant for a press reception . Before anyone could ask a question , Bonynge delivered a shrill lecture : " I will not allow myself and my wife to be persecuted by orangutans of the press , " he shouted . " We have been most vexatiously wearied by the impertinence of photographers at the airport , when we had given firm instructions that the press was not to know of our arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press . " <P> For a moment the press was speechless . Then one reporter mumbled : " You 're carrying on a bit much , are n't you mate ? " At that , Joan and husband stormed out , followed by the frantic restaurant manager . He had spent most of the day whipping up a special fish sauce for Joan that he said was " comparable to the peach Melba , the tribute to that other Australian soprano , Dame Nellie Melba . " The manager fell to his knees on the sidewalk , kissed Joan 's hand and begged her to return . She went back after some hesitation , then tried to laugh away the incident by mimicking orangutans shelling peanuts at the zoo . Richard was still sullen . <P> " You should realize that my wife is not a rock ' n ' roller or a pop singer but the queen of song . "
