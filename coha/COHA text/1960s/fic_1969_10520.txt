was the one thing the guys did know about . I do n't know how many days he 'd waited outside Ebbets Field to get them  --  all I know is he had the best collection of baseballplayers ' signatures of any guy in school . Lots of them were addressed personally , too  --  like " To Louie , with best wishes from Jackie Robinson . " What amazed me most about Louie , though , was that he could figure out a player 's batting average in his head . If a guy got a hit his first time up in a game , Louie would say , " That raises his average to .326 "  --  Or whatever it was  --  and sure enough , the next time the guy came up , when the announcer would give the average , Louie would be right . Louie had no illusions about his athletic ability  --  he was never one of those guys who hangs around when you 're choosingup sides for a punchball or stickball game so that you have to pick him . Whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he did what you told him and tried to stay out of the way . That was why I was so surprised when he came up to my house one night after supper and asked if he could be on our baseball team . " Gee , Louie , " I said , " we got more than nine guys already  --  anyway , we 're not even an official team or anything . We 'll be lucky if we get to play more than five or six games all year . " " I do n't really want to play , " Louie said . " I  --  I just want to be on your team . " " Well , I suppose you can come to practices and games , " I said . " But I ca n't promise you 'll ever get in a game . " " Honest , Howie  --  I know all the guys on your team are better than me . I was n't even thinking of playing .  --  What I 'd like to do is be your general manager . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked at him , puzzled . " Look , " he said . " What do you think makes the Dodgers draw almost as many fans as the Yankees ? What was it thatp51made people stick with the Dodgers when they were hardly in the league ? " " I do n't know , " I said . " They were just Dodger fans , I guess . " " Sure  --  that 's it . Do n't you see ? Being a Dodger fan means something because being a Dodger means something colorful to the fans . And you know why ? Because the Dodgers have what my dad calls a good press '  --  they know how to get headlines in the papers whether they 're winning or losing . " I nodded . " But what 's that got to do with us ? " " What 's your team like now ? I 'll tell you . It 's the same as ten thousand other teams of guys our age all over Brooklyn . Nobody cares if you win or lose  --  except maybe you guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll promise you this  --  your team will be noticed . Guys wo n't say , We got a game with Howie 's team . ' They wo n't come to the Parade Grounds to see all the older guys play . They 'll come to see The Zodiacs ! " " The who  --  ? " Louie stopped for a second and I realized that I 'd never heard him speak so fast before . " That 's  --  that 's the first thing you have to do , it seems to me . " He spoke more hesitantly now , the way he usually did , not looking right at you . " You have to have a name that 's different . " " What 's wrong with calling ourselves the Sharks ? " " Nothing 's wrong with it  --  but do n't you see , nothing 's right with it , either . I 'll bet there 's a hundred teams in Brooklyn alone called the Sharks . Sharks , Tigers , Lions , Phantoms  --  every team has a name like that . But calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will make them different  --  " " Sure  --  but giving us a crazy name is n't going to win us any games . " " Right . What will win you games ? I 'll tell you . A good pitcher . I 've been going down to the Parade Grounds to watchp52games , making a study of the teams there , and I 've found that pitching is about ninety percent of winning . Especially at our age , when we 're not fully built up yet . Did you know , for example , that on high school teams pitchers average about eleven strike-outs a game ? It 's like with baseball teams in spring training  --  thepitchers are way ahead of the hitters , because the hitters ' reflexes are n't developed yet . " " Izzie 's a pretty good pitcher , " I said . Izzie was my best friend , and the pitcher for our team . " Sure , but let 's face it , he 's not a real top-drawer pitcher . He 's just not big enough to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but his fast ball is almost a change-up . If you let me be general manager , Howie , I 'll get the best pitcher in our school to play for us . " " Who 's that ? " " George Santini . " I gulped . " Him ? " " That 's right . " George Santini was a year ahead of us at P.S. 92 and he was always getting in trouble with the teachers and the cops . He was about six feet tall , had black greasy hair which was long and cut square in back , and the biggest pair of shoulders I 'd ever seen on a guy . He was also the best athlete in our school . The coaches and teachers were always talking to him about going straight and being a star in high school and college , but George never seemed to care much . He was the leader of this gang , which , as far as everybody in our section of Brooklyn was concerned , was the most dangerous gang the world had ever known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother , Vinnie . Vinnie was about nineteen years old and he 'd already spent two years in jail . He was a skinny guy  --  not at all like George  --  and the word on him was that he was reallyp53chicken . To listen to George , though , you would have thought that Vinnie was the toughest guy ever to hit Brooklyn . Wheneverhe wanted an audience , George would sit down on the steps of the school  --  on Rogers Avenue  --  and start telling tales of all the jobs he and Vinnie had pulled off . Sometimes , if we 'd bother him enough , he 'd tell us about the gang wars he had fought in with Vinnie  --  in Prospect Park , in Red Hook , in Bay Ridge . If he was sure no teachers or cops were around he 'd show us his zip gun , the gun that Johnny Angelo  --  one of George 's lackeys  --  claimed George had once used to kill a guy with . " I do n't know , " I said . " If my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really get it  --  and , anyway , how would you get him to play for us ? " Louie smiled . " You leave that to me . " A few days later I got all the guys together at my house and I let Louie speak to them . He told them what he 'd told me about how he would make our team special , maybe famous  --  and he also told them that George Santini had agreed to pitch for us . A few of the guys reacted the way I did to this news  --  they were scared . But when Louie insisted he 'd be able to handle George , Izzie and I backed him up . " I say it 's worth a try , " Izzie said . " Even though I 'm pitcher and he 'll take my place . I 'll bet we could beat lots of high school teams with him pitching for us . " " Sure , " I said . " You ever see the way he can blaze a ball in . " A few more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all agreed that we 'd probably be invincible with George Santinipitching for us . " One thing , though , " asked Kenny Murphy , our second baseman . " How 'd you get him to play for us ? " " Simple , " said Louie . " I offered him the one thing heP54could n't refuse  --  fame . I told him I 'd get his name in the newspapers . It 's not hard . All you have to do is telephone in the box score to the Brooklyn Eagle and they 'll print it . My father knows a guy who works there . " For the next few weeks Louie was the busiest guy in the world  --  calling up guys at other schools , arranging games , gettingpermits from the Park Department , coming to our practices . . . When he started giving us suggestions on things , nobodyobjected either . He may have been a lousy ballplayer , but he knew more about the game than any of us . Izzie and I gave up playing basketball in the schoolyard afternoons and weekendsand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first game was scheduled for a Saturday morning the second week in April . Louie had gotten us a permit to use one of the diamonds at the Parade Grounds , next to Prospect Park , from nine to twelve in the morning , and we were supposed to play a team of eighth-graders from P.S. 246 . I was at the field with Izzie by 8:3o , but the other team did n't get there until after nine . We ran through infield practice and then let them have the field for a while . Kenny Murphy 's father , who 'd played for the Bushwicks when they were a semi-pro team , had agreed to umpire the game . By a quarter to ten neither Louie nor George had shown up and the other team was hollering that we were afraid to play them . Since George had never come to any practices , some of us were a little worried , but at about five to ten he showed up . He was wearing a baseball hat like the rest of us , with a Z sewn on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was smoking and he did n't say much to anybody . He just asked who the catcher was and started warming up . He wore a T-shirt , with the sleeves cut off . Looking at him , you would have thought he was too muscle-bound to be a pitcher , but when he reared back and kicked his left foot high in the air , then whipped his armP55around , he was as smooth as Warren Spahn , only righty , with the natural straight overhand motion that every coach spends his nights dreaming about . Stan Reiss , our catcher , had to put an extra sponge in his mitt , but he was so proud , catching George with all the guys looking at the two of them , that I think he would have let the ball burn a hole in his hand before he would have given up his position . " C'm on , " George said after a dozen or so warm-ups . " Let 's get the game going . " " We were waiting for Louie , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay , " George said . " But he better hurry . I got better things to do than spend all day strikin ' out a bunch of fags . " He said the last thing loudly , for the benefit of the other team . Then he turned and spit in their direction , daring one of them to contradict him . No one did . A minute later I saw Louie . He was getting out of his mother 's car , on Caton Avenue , and he was carrying this tremendousthing . From my position at shortstop I could n't make it out , but as he came nearer , running awkwardly and holding it in front of him like a package of groceries , I realized what it was : his old victrola . " Hey , George ! " Louie called . " You ready to break Feller 's strike-out record ? " George laughed . " Anytime they get in the batter 's box  --  " " Wait a second , " Louie said . He put the victrola downnext to the backstop . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to to get it to work , and then he started playinga record . At first it was n't cranked up enough and youcould n't tell what kind of music it was . But then Louie crankedsome more  --  and I whipped off my hat and stood at attention as the strains of " The Star-Spangled Banner " came blastingacross the infield . I looked at George and he was smiling asP56broadly as he could , holding his cap across his heart , standing rigid , at attention . The team from P.S. 246 must have been as shocked as we were , but by the time the music got to " and the rockets ' red glare " both teams were standing at attention , saluting , listening , while Louie kept cranking away so that the music would n't slow down . People sitting on benches , guys playing on other diamonds , men and women walking along Caton Avenue , a few park cops  --  they all stopped and started drifting toward our diamond . When the record was over , Louie  --  in the loudest voice I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we started the game . We must have had a crowd of over fifty people watching us play our first game , and I told myself that if George had been pitching for a Major League team that day he would have pitched at least a shut-out . He struck out all but two of their men  --  one guy hit a grounder to me at shortstop , and another fouled out to Corky Williams at first base . He also hit four home runs . I got a double and two singles , I remember . We won , 19-0 , and the next day , as Louie 'd promised , our box score was in the BrooklynEagle . Louie got us six more games during the next two weeks , and we won all of them . George gave up a total of seven hits in the six games , and he was a pretty happy guy during that time . He had clippings of the box scores of all the games in his wallet , the way we all did . Clippings of the box scores  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best clipping of all : an item in Jimmy O'Brien 's column in the Brooklyn Eagle about our team , mentioningGeorge , and Louie 's victrola . I think I carried that clippingaround with me until my third year in high school . After that we began getting even more attention and teams from all over Brooklyn were challenging us to games . We played as many of them as we could  --  and George kept shutting out every team we played . In the meantime Louie devised another plan . He calledP57a meeting of the team the second week in May to discuss it . He told us that a team with our ability and prestige had to live up to its name . We said we were  --  we were winning games , were n't we ? " Sure , " Louie said . " But what do you look like out on the field ? People are starting to come in pretty large numbers to see us play  --  they hear about us , we got a reputation  --  and then when they see us , we look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went on . " What we have to do , " he said , " is develop some class . And I 've got the plan worked out . It 's not new , I 'll admit  --  lots of the high school guys use it . I say we run a raffle and use the money to buy ourselves jackets and uni-forms . " We all liked the idea of jackets and uniforms , naturally , but they cost a lot of money  --  especially the kind of uniforms and jackets we wanted to have . " I got it all figured out , " Louie said , pulling out some pieces of paper . Then he started talking about numbers , and once he did that , I knew we 'd get those uniforms and jackets . It turned out that Louie could get a clock radio at a discount from an uncle of his . Then he said he could get Levy 's Sporting Goods Store , on Flatbush Avenue , to donate a glove and ball for the raffle . He also said they 'd sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention them in his column sometime . Louie said his father could take care of that . We 'd make the radio first prize and the glove and ball second prize , but we 'd tell the kids at school that if they won first prize we 'd give them the glove and ball anyway . There were fifteen of us and if we each sold five books of ten chances at a quarter apiece , that 'd be almost two hundred dollars . Louie said that he himselfwould sell at least fifteen books , and he expected most of us to sell more than five . If we took in three hundred dollars in the raffle , we could have the uniforms and jackets . George was at the meeting this time  --  in Louie 's house  --   |p58and  he volunteered to get his gang to sell chances . All of us were pretty glad then that we 'd be on the selling end of the raffle during the next few weeks . Louie smiled and said he 'd already had the raffle books printed and that the drawing would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 , we all knew , we had a big game with the Flatbush Raiders , a team from P.S. 139 that had lost only one game . Louie said that if we could give Levy 's a down payment of one hundred dollars they 'd go ahead and get the uniforms and jackets made in time for the game against the Raiders . We only had two games during the next week , and the rest of the time all of us were running around getting everybodywe knew  --  friends , relatives , neighbors , teachers , store owners  --  to buy chances . By the following Friday , Louie reported that we had more than a hundred dollars and that Levy 's had already started making the uniforms and jackets . The uniforms would be gray with orange lettering and the jackets were going to be made of an orange and black material that felt like satin , with The Zodiacs written across the back in bright yellow . By the middle of the following week Louie reported to us that if we went over three hundred dollars  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used to get Louisville Sluggersand official National League baseballs for the team . Louie also told us that his father could probably get Jimmy O'Brien to come down to see our game against the Raiders . On Wednesday afternoon , two days before the raffle drawing , Louie rode out on his bicycle to Marine Park , where the Raiders were playing a game , and when he showed up at our big meeting on Friday , June 1 , he had a stack of scouting notes . " Before we get to our skull session on the Raiders , " he said , " we have to get this raffle business over with . First , someP59of you have n't given me all the money  --  or the leftover raffles . " While Louie took care of the final accounts on the raffle , George stayed by himself in a corner , looking through Louie 's sports magazines . Although he spoke to a few of us a little more , you could n't really say that any of us had become pals with him . At school he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  on the days when we did n't have games  --  we knew that he still hung around with his brother . " Okay , " said Louie . " I got it all figured out . Just a few things do n't check . You , Marty , you took out seven books and only gave me fifteen dollars . " " I forgot , " Marty said . He handed Louie a book of tickets . " I did n't sell these . " Louie crossed his name off . He seemed to be stalling , because he kept adding and subtracting figures and I knew that he never had that much trouble figuring things out . " George ? " " Yeah ? " " According to my records you gave me raffle stubs from sixteen books , which means you owe forty dollars . " " So ? " " You only gave me twenty-eight so far . " We were all quiet . George was n't looking straight at Louie . He had a magazine out , with a picture of Sal Maglie on the cover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe you did n't give me sixteen books , " George said . " I did . It 's right here in writing . " " Hell , anybody can phony up figures . " " I did n't phony them up . " Louie 's voice was loud . " You still owe twelve dollars . " " Prove it . " " Prove it ? It 's down here in black and white . " " Oh yeah ? My word 's as good as yours . "  | " It 's not ! " " Are you callin ' me a liar ? " George stood up now and walked toward Louie . " I 'm just saying you owe twelve dollars . You better pay up , or  --  " " Or what , smarty ? " " Or  --  " Louie stopped . "  --  Or you ca n't play tomorrow . " George laughed . But his laugh was forced . " Who needs to play with you guys , anyway ? You ca n't win without me and you know it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean it , George . You wo n't get your uniform and you wo n't get to play in front of Jimmy O'Brien either . . . " " I do n't give a damn , " George said . He walked up to Louie and pushed his fist at Louie 's face . Louie did n't move . This surprised George . " I never should of given you the twentyeightdollars either . And you know what you can do with your raffle  --  " George did n't finish his sentence . Instead , he picked up the clock radio , raised it over his head , and then flung it to the floor , splattering its parts all over the room . Louie leapt at George , screaming curse words , but with an easy push George shoved him to the floor . Then he kicked him a few times and Louie started crying . He got up and went for George again , and this time I was ready . I grabbed George 's right arm . " C'm on , you guys , help me hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got him in a stranglehold . George tried to throw him off , but by this time Kenny and Corky and Stan and the other guys were all holding George . He fought and it took all our strength to hold him , but it was fifteen to one and these odds were too much , even for him . " C'm on , Louie , " I said . " Give it to him now . " " Yeah , c'm on , " the guys yelled . " Let him have it .. .  |p61right  in the gut . . . he deserves it . . . give it to him good . . . " Louie was still crying , but he came at George . " You 're  --  you 're nothing but a bum ! " he screamed . George spit at him . " C'm on , " Kenny said . " We ca n't hold him all day . Just give it to him  --  " " Yeah , c'm on , ya little sawed-off runt  --  I hear they 're gettin ' up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . " " You 're just a big bum , " Louie said , whimpering . He was breathing heavily . " I would n't waste my knuckles on you . Just get out of my house . Get out . We  --  we do n't need crooks on The Zodiacs . Get out . Get out . . . " Then Louie started crying again . We all pushed and pulled George to the door and somehowwe managed to slam it with him on the other side . We ran off the raffle anyway . Louie said the money that was going to go for bats and balls would be enough to get another radio  --  and a few hours later we left Louie 's apartment . I was glad I lived in his building . The next morning there were over two hundred people gathered around the backstop and baselines at the Parade Grounds . Izzie warmed up and he looked good . I think the new uniforms made us all play a little over our heads that day . The pitcher on the Raiders was very fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if his control was off . When Louie cranked up his victrola before the game , most of the onlookers started laughing . We ignored them . In fact , I think hearing the National Anthem , the way we had in all our other games , made us play even harder , because in the first inning Izzie held the other team and , in our half , Kenny Murphy doubled and then I hit a single which drove him in . That was the last time we had the lead , though . The Raiders tied it up in the third inning and went ahead in the fourth , by 4-1 . The final score was 7-2 . P62When we were picking up our gloves and stuff , and changing out of our spikes , nobody said anything . And nobody looked at Louie . We waited for each other and were walking away from the diamond when Stan spotted George . " Uh-oh , " he said , pointing . " He 's got his gang with him . " We all looked and we saw about ten of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey , " George shouted , coming nearer . " Ai n't those guys got pretty uniforms . " " Yeah , " said one of his guys . " And look at those jackets . They look like my mommy 's underwear  --  " This seemed to strike George 's gang as a pretty good joke . " Hey , you bunch of fags , " George said . " Who won the game ? " Nobody answered . George and his gang had almost reached us now . " Aw , c'm on  --  you do n't mean you let those other fruitbootsbeat you , do you ? How could anybody beat a team that 's got a manager like Louie ? He 's real smart , ai n't he ? " George was in front of us now , about fifteen feet from Louie , his hands on his hips . Louie stopped . " C'm on , smart boy . Cross my path , I dare you  --  " " Do n't do it , Louie ! " I shouted . I looked around , hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't want any trouble , " he said . " Hey , listen to this , guys . He says he do n't want no trouble . Ai n't that nice . I do n't want none either , see . Only I say you called me a liar and a crook and I do n't take that from nobody . " ' " I  --  I did n't mean to call you that , " Louie said . " Why do n't we just forget the whole thing . " " I do n't forget easy . "  |p6363I  was holding one of the bats and I gripped the handle firmly . The other guys had already let their gloves and equipmentdrop onto the grass . I spotted a cop about a half block away . He was moving toward us . I tried to stall . " What 's the gripe , George ? " I asked . " You mad ' cause you did n't get to pitch today ? " " You keep your trap shut , Howie . Ca n't Louie fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want any trouble , that 's all . " The guys in George 's gang began to move toward us and then George shoved Louie . I ran at him , the bat raised over my head . " We got bats , George . One of you is gon na get a bloody head . " " You do n't scare us with your toothpicks ! " Somebody grabbed my arm and then the fight was on . It did n't last long  --  probably less than a minute  --  but by the time the cop got there and started bopping guys on the head with his nightstick most of us , myself included , were glad it was over . I had managed to get a leg-scissors on George and even though he was blasting me in the gut I held on long enough so he could n't get at Louie . More cops were on the scene by then and when we were separated they asked the usual questionsabout who had started the fight . When they saw that nobody was going to give them any answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all of you  --  get on home . You , kid , " the cop said , pointing to Kenny . " You better get some ice on that eye in a hurry . " George 's gang started to move away , and then George turned and called to us . " We 'll get you guys at school  --  " One of the cops ran after George and grabbed him by the front of his jacket . " Okay , tough boy , " he said . " If I find out that one hair on the head of any of these kids was touched , I'llP64throw you and every one of your cronies in jail . You hear that ? " George nodded . " Hey , " the cop said suddenly . " I know you . You 're George Santini , ai n't you ? Vinnie Santini 's brother  --  " " So what ? " George tried to squirm out of the cop 's grip . " It figures , " the cop laughed . " You know who Vinnie Santiniis ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's that punk we had down at the station last week . I never seen a guy turn yellow so quick .

Another cop held George while the first cop put his nose right up to George 's face and continued . " I never seen a guy turn yellow so quick , " he said . " We did n't have the light on him more than ten minutes when he started ratting on every petty thief this side of Bensonhurst . And you 're probably the same . " George did n't say anything . He just sort of hung there , held up by the cop . " Get goin ' , punk , " said the cop , shoving George . " And I better not hear that you touched these kids . " George and his gang walked away . We all picked up our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then suddenlyLouie started running after George . " Hey , wait a minute ! Wait  --  " George turned and waited till Louie caught up to him . " Yeah ? " George said . Louie stopped , as if he 'd forgotten why he had told George to wait . Then he spoke , in that slow , hesitant way of his . " I was going over the records last night , " he said . " And I discovered that I made a mistake yesterday . You really only owed eight dollars . I was thinking that if you gave me the eight dollars , then  --  then you could pitch for us against the Raiders . We play them a return game next week . "   " Who 'd wan na play on your sissy team ? " said one of the guys in George 's gang . George looked at Louie , then at the guys in the gang , then back at Louie . " I 'll let you know , " he said , and walked off . The next day he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with George pitching and wearing his new uniform , we beat the Raiders , 4-0 . We were the happiest group of guys in Brooklyn , George included . We won about a dozen more games that month . At the end of June , though , lots of the guys , myself included , went away to camp or to the country and the team had to break up . The next year when George was a freshman at Erasmus Hall High School he did n't play for us . When he was a sophomore at Erasmus  --  I was a freshmanthat year  --  he played fullback on the football team and was starting pitcher on the baseball team . In the middle of his junior year , though , he quit school . The next time I heard about him , somebody said he had taken off for Florida with his brother . P68struggled to get away from its master ; it snarled , baring its teeth , and with this , the two boys jumped from behind the garbagecans and streaked downhill . Finkel shouted curses after them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from in front of the house . The door of the taxi started to open and Finkel was there at once , holding it , pushing his hand into that of the man who was getting out . " Professor Perlman ! " he exclaimed . " I recognizeyou from your pictures . I am Hyman Finkel , superintendent . " Professor Perlman looked at the dog and hesitated . Finkel laughed and patted its head affectionately . " This is Sasha , named for my oldest brother , he should rest in peace , destroyedon the other side . Do not fear him . At his age , I can assure you , the saying about the bark and the bite is true . Sasha  --  say hello to Professor Perlman . " At this the dog began waggingits tail furiously , rubbing its heavy body against Professor Perlman 's leg . " Sasha is almost fourteen years old , " Finkel said . The professor looked down at the dog , noticing its huge stomach , which sagged toward the gutter . He paid the driver and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lobby was dark and cool . " Ah , Sasha , " Finkel said as the dog trotted behind them . " When will you die ? When ? Already this year you have cost me in the hundreds for doctor 's fees .

" He laughed again and pushed the professor in front of him into the elevator . As they rose , he explained . " To give them a sense of terror , that is why ! " Cramped in the small elevator , the professor held one valise waist-high . Sweat trickled down his back and Finkel 's stale breath annoyed him . " Do you understand what I mean ? " He pushed his face toward the professor 's . " Now I hope you wo n't take this personally , P69Professor Perlman , but my clients in this building , so many of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in a protected world . Insulated . A world of ideas , of theories , books , abstractions . Between them and Harlem are parks , private schools , music lessons , fancy summer camps  --  and so it goes , if you know what I mean . " The elevator stopped and the door slid open . Finkel led the way down the hall . Sasha and the professor followed him . Finkel turned back , stopping so abruptly that the professor almost knocked into him , and under his stained Dutch Boy painter 's hat , Finkel 's eyes were shining . " So I terrorize them ! You see ? I create for them a sense of reality , of evil . In my own time I am a legend  --  Finkel the former SS officer . Ha ! Twenty years ago I planted the rumor , but with that one rumor  --  what stories they have been able to fabricate . If you could hear of the things I have done to countless women and children , Professor , it would make your hair fall out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and shook his head . " Here we are , " he said . From his overalls he took a ring of keys and flipped through them , finding the right one . Finkel showed the professor around the three rooms , pointing out the improvements he had put in , the special items  --  extra bookcases , a used television set , a large oak rolltop desk . Professor Perlman thanked him and handed him a ten-dollar bill . " For your troubles , " he said . " Let me tell you something , Professor , " Finkel said , pocketingthe money without comment . They were in the living room now and Finkel sat down in a large easy chair , Sasha at his feet . " You did the right thing . Do n't let anybody tell you no . It is not easy for old men to live alone . When Professor Hafer telephoned me and explained the situation , what with the commuting , the upkeep of a large house  --  believe me , I know the chores that go into maintaining even a modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wisest thing youP70could do . Give it up now . " He cleared his throat . " Sit down please , Professor , " he said . " Rest a little . You 're entitled  --  you 've had a long trip , your apartment is in order , what is there for you to do ? " The professor sat ; Finkel leaned forward , his face suddenly intent . " And before we leave the subject , I hope you will accept my condolences upon the loss of your wife . Although I did not have the good fortune to know her , I understandfrom Professor Hafer and others that she was a fine woman . And the years . All those years spent together , Professor . Oh , the years , the years  --  " Finkel paused and , not knowing what else to do , ProfessorPerlman started to thank him . " Please , " Finkel said , putting up his hand . " There is no need to say anything . What are we to do at times like these ? When my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  did words console me ? Bah ! Death is death . " He sat back . " Tell me , Professor , what are your plans ? " " My plans ? " " Now that you are alone . Let 's face it , a young man you 're not  --  how much longer will you teach ? " The professor looked at him quizzically . " Come , " Finkel said . " Talk to me . It will do you good  --  you and me , Professor  --  two old men like us , despite the difference in our vocations , we have much in common . I can tell . You 're Jewish , are n't you ? " The professor nodded . " Tell me , are you a practicing Jew ? " " No , " the professor said , and as he replied he could hear the antagonism in his own voice . " No , I 'm not . " Finkel smiled . " The same for me , " he said . " You and me , we are psychological Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I mean . We hate the religion yet we are proud of our Jewishness . And why not ? Why not , Professor Perlman ? " His question was loud , belligerent  --  but before the professor couldp71reply , Finkel was chuckling . " The way he was jealous of his wife before they were married  --  one day there was no letter in his mailbox and he was half insane ! He picked her to pieces . That is Jewish . Martha , she was a good wife to him , very balabatish , if you know what I mean . " Finkel paused , hoping for a reaction , but there was none . " That means that she was the queen of his household , " he said . " That the home was everything to her , that she was a good Jewish wife . " " I know what the word means , " Professor Perlman said sharply . Finkel looked away , smoothing Sasha 's fur . " Freud himself was quite haimisheh , you know , " the professor added quickly , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had prompted his comment , the use of Yiddish .. . " Ah  --  " Finkel said . " You are quite right , of course . The way that man loved his children , his sisters , his wife . I thank God for one thing  --  that he died before the war . If he had known that he had left his four old sisters behind only to have them all incinerated like Sasha  --  " He raised both his hands toward the ceiling , his fingers trembling , outstretched . " I thank God for that , Professor Perlman . The man had suffered enough for one lifetime  --  betrayed by his followers , forced to leave his beloved Vienna , the endless pain and operations ! Year after year they hacked and sawed at his mouth and jaw , removing everything . As if the first operation did n't cause enough pain , eh ? For how long , Professor , I ask you , for how many years did he suffer his cancer ? " " Sixteen , I believe . " " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did anyone ever hear him complain ? Not Freud . He was a man , Professor , I 'll tell you that . A human being and a Jew , if you know what I mean . Thirty-three operations he endured . The number is significant , eh , Professor Perlman ? " His voice dropped . " But whyP72do you think  --  why was such suffering brought to him ? Why  --  ? " Finkel was leaning forward , excited . " Anyone who has read your books would know the mystery in such a question , Professor . I ask you , did Moses get to enter the Promised Land ? Why did Freud love Moses so ? Because he too was Jewish , Professor . Moses and Monotheism . Moses the Egyptian , Moses the Gentile  --  but passionate , suffering , moral . " Finkel stood up , hovering above the professor , shaking his fist . " What does it matter how a man is born ? Like you and me , Professor , like the great Freud himself , Moses was a psychological Jew  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and shook the professor'shand . " I must be going , " he said . " Though I have certainlyenjoyed our talk . We will continue it  --  yes ? As I said , we have a lot in common , you and me . " At the door he reminded the professor to call him the minute he had need of anything . " For minor electrical repairs I am merely competent , " Finkel said . " But as a plumber I am first-rate  --  I can assure you of that . " Sasha brushed against Professor Perlman 's leg , and then he was alone . He wanted to laugh but found that he could n't . Had the conversation really taken place ? The professor shook his head , to clear it . He moved around the apartment slowly , purposefully  --  unpacking , arranging books and clothing , sorting papers  --  but he tired quickly , and lay down in the bedroom to rest . His right leg was hurting again and he massaged the calf . And now what , Professor Perlman , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question , he heard somebody laugh . He sat up . It was a girl 's laugh , and it was followed by giggling , then some words , then more giggling . When the girl screamed , he swung his feet to the floor and listened carefully . The giggling started again , from the bathroom . " Not now , John , " the girl said . " Stop , please . . . John . . . Oh you ! ... " Above the toilet bowl , the professor saw , was a grat-P73ing about ten inches square , and the sounds came from it . An air shaft , an exhaust ?  --  Finkel could have told him its exact purpose . He closed the toilet and sat on the seat , listening . " I really have to study . . . John . . . I mean it . . . that tickles ... Stop ! ... " Silence , heavy breathing , a low moan . The professor thought of his daughter , Barbara , in her senior year at Barnard . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch it .. . that hurt . . . " Giggling . " I mean it , John , I have a test . . . " For the first time , words from the man " Okay , I have to go over some stuff for Perlman 's course . . . " The professor stood up . " Do you still like it ? " . . . " Oh , yeah  --  he 's not too dynamic . . . I mean , you have to pay close attention , but he 's good , especially when he forgets his notes and just rambles about things  --  music or science . You should have heard him the other day , going on about Freud 's idea of the death wish ! " Professor Perlman tried to place the voice , but it vanished in a sudden scraping of the wall , an " Ouch ! " and furious laughter . He walked out of the bathroom , shutting the door behind him . He telephoned his daughter and asked if she would like to have dinner with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had a surprise for him , he was to come to her apartment . " Oh , " she said . " I almost forgot . How 's your apartment ? " " It 's all right . Fine , really . " " Good , " she said . " I have to do something now , okay , Daddy ? Come over soon . Bye . " Downstairs , Finkel was waiting for him . Professor Perlmannodded , smiled weakly , and tried to pass , but Finkel stopped him , gripping his arm above the elbow . Sasha was at his feet , his head on his paws . The fur around his neck was gray ; his eyes , the professor noticed , were outlined with a sticky white substance . " Ah , Professor , " Finkel said . " I was hoping you would come by . Have you eaten dinner yet ? " " No.  | " Then perhaps you would like to join me in my apartment . Roast leg of lamb ! " He kissed his fingertips . " Very fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you very much , Mr. Finkel , " the professor said . " But I already have a dinner engagement . " " Ah , " Finkel said . " A dinner engagement .  --  Is that different from dinner ? " He laughed good-naturedly . " Do n't mind an old fool like me . But I mean it  --  when you are free some eveningI will cook for us , all right ? " He came closer . " Why not ? Two old men like us , living in the same building , why should n't we be friends , companions ? We are both Jews , no ? " " You 'll have to excuse me , " Professor Perlman said , pullinghis arm from Finkel 's grip and hurrying from the building . He cut across the Columbia campus , vowing to speak to Fred Hafer in the morning about moving out of the building  --  but Fred would ask him why , he knew , and if he tried to explain about Finkel , Fred would only suggest again that he needed to relax , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rest of the semester . Barbara lived along Morningside Drive with another girl from Barnard , in one of the university-owned buildings , but when he arrived the girl was gone  --  to a concert , Barbara said  --  and in her place was a young man named David Shapiro . " I trust I 'm not intruding . " " Do n't be silly  --  take your jacket off . David 's been helpingme with the surprise . Guess what it is ? " He said he did n't know . " Roast duck ! " she exclaimed proudly . " With orange  --  the way you like it . " She turned to go into the kitchen . " You and David talk while I get things ready . Dave , fix Father a drink  --  bourbon , straight . You know where everything is . " Then she was gone to prepare the dishes she had taken from her mother 's recipes , and he was left with her young man . David seemed very much at home . Too much so ? He sat downp75and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead her own life . Do n't judge . Do n't advise . For God 's sake , do n't pressure her ! Naomi 's death was no easy thing to adjust to . She was an only child . They had been very close . Then too , had n't he and Naomi lived together for two years before marriage ? He smiled , remembering . She had been a student of his in a graduate seminar . The boy seemed nice enough . He asked him what he did . " Do n't you remember me ? " David asked . " I was in your seminar on Elizabethan poetry last year . " " Of course , " he said , laughing . " You 'll have to forgive me . I 'm a little distracted this evening  --  what with moving  --  and  --  " " That 's all right , " David said , and began telling the professorabout his graduate courses , his ideas for papers , his projects . Professor Perlman tried to appear attentive . His lecture classes were large , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he remember the boy ? " Are you retiring this year ? " " Am I what ? " " Retiring  --  I 'd heard you might " " Do n't be silly . " " I 'm sorry , sir , " the boy said . " I know you can retire at sixty-three if you want , that 's why  --  " " No , no  --  I intend to teach to the end , " he said . " To the end . " They ate quietly and the professor enjoyed listening to their gentle teasing , their intense opinions . David asked him if he had ever written about something they had discussed once in the seminar . " Eros , entropy , and the Elizabethans , " David explained to Barbara . " That was the phrase your father used  --  the affinities between the Elizabethan notion of the love-death relationship and Freud 's . Your father pointed out that just as the seventeenth-century belief in the unity of love and death was related to their belief in the decay of the world , so Freud'sp76notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern idea of entropy  --  " He held a fork in front of him , pieces of duck impaled on its prongs , and talked on . Professor Perlmanpretended to listen but found himself annoyed . After dinner , saying he had more unpacking to do , he left . Barbara said she would call him the next day , that she wanted to make curtainsfor his apartment . He walked across the campus and down Broadway to 115th Street , but once he was in the building he could not rememberwhich floor he lived on . His name was not listed on the register above the mailboxes  --  but on three of the boxes  --  8A , 8F , and 9C  --  names were missing , and he assumed one of the three was his . He rode the elevator to the eighth floor and listenedat the door of 8A . Voices . He tried 8F . Voices again . He walked up a flight of stairs , found 9C , and , hearing nothing , tried the key in the lock . The door opened and he turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was an envelope . It had his name typed on it and , relieved to discover that he was in the right apartment , he opened it . " Received from Professor Jerold M. Perlman the Sum of Ten Dollars ( $10 ) for Services Rendered . " It was signed , " HymanFinkel , Superintendent . " In the bathroom , brushing his teeth , he looked at the grating and , as he did , the giggling resumed . " Stop ! Jesus , John , I mean it . . . " Silence , then softly : " Please , John .. . please . . . oh . . . " He rinsed his mouth . At least , he thought , looking at his teeth in the mirror , he did n't have to use dentures yet . " Honest , " came the boy 's voice . " It 'll help you relax for your test . . . " He closed the door quickly and made up his bed with clean sheets ; he undressed , locked his door , tried to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Sasha . In his old age , he recalled , Freud had come to love dogs , had become dreadfully attached to them . When one ofp77them died  --  a chow , if he remembered correctly he had writtento Jones that he 'd felt the loss more deeply than that of most human beings . He was up at eight the next morning . To his surprise , he felt good  --  vigorous , fresh  --  and he busied himself with notes for the day 's classes . At half past ten he left the apartment . Finkel was in the lobby , repairing a light fixture . He climbed down from his ladder . " Ah , Professor , " he said , stopping Perlman . " I was hoping I would catch you this morning . As you see , I am alone . Sasha is not feeling well  --  he spent a restless night . Very restless . " " I really must be going , " Professor Perlman said , walking away . " I have a class . " Finkel caught up with him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute  --  and quite useful to you , you will see . Quite useful . " Finkel stopped and looked back into the lobby , to be sure they were not overheard . Professor Perlman found him particularly repulsive ; he noticed the yellow teeth , long hairs protruding from the nostrils , a mole . Finkel wiped some mucus away with the back of his hand and spoke . " I meant to ask you this yesterday , when we were talking about your wife , but for some reason it slipped my mind . A slip of the mind  --  that is significant , no ? " He laughed and came closer . " I am very curious about something , if it is not too personal , Professor . Tell me  --  your wife , how was she disposed of ? " Perlman pushed him away and jerked the door open . Finkel clasped his hand on the back of Perlman 's and pushed on it , closing the door . " Of course , if this is very personal to you , I will respect your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am after is this  --  was she buried or was she cremated ? " " Buried . " " Ts , ts , ts , " Finkel said . " Very bad . But , " he added , shrugging , " that may have been her wish . What I am most interestedP78in , really  --  what I can be of service to you for , is this  --  here is why I stopped you : what are your plans for yourself ? " " Mr. Finkel , if you do n't mind , I must hurry to class . " The professor tried to get away but Finkel barred the door with his body . " I ask only this of an important thinker like yourself , ProfessorPerlman . That you give the idea of cremation your seriousconsideration . I have some literature in my apartment which I will leave for you in your mailbox  --  but is there really need for it ? Bah ! Did not Freud himself specify his own cremation ? And do not his ashes now lie collected in one of his favoriteGrecian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcomed the fresh air . " Go to your class , Professor . But I beg of you  --  give the matter your consideration . Death is no insignificant thing . It is something to think about . " When Professor Perlman returned from class that afternoonthe literature was , as Finkel had promised , in his mailbox . He tore it to shreds without looking at it , and tried to figure out what to do . It was a convenience , living near the campus , true , near Barbara  --  and he did not relish returning to the empty house Naomi and he had spent the last twenty years in . Even if he did , the agent said he already had a buyer . He had , though , to avoid Finkel . For the next few days he was successful . If , when he left the building , Finkel was in the lobby , he would go down to the basement and exit through the cellar ; if he saw Finkel in front of the building when he returned home , he would go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him feel ludicrous but he felt he had no choice . For perhaps a week he evaded Finkel , and Finkel , for his part , did not seem to pursue him . He felt better . One afternoon , however , he returned home to discover that he had locked himself out and forgotten the key . Such forgetfulness , he knew , was no mere accident . He sighed , went into the basement , and roused Finkel from his apartment . " Ah , Professor , " Finkel saidp79as they rode up in the elevator , Sasha nuzzling against Perlman'sleg . " Have you considered the literature I gave to you ? I have been so busy since the last time we spoke that I did not have a chance to get back to our discussions  --  first the oil burner went crazy , then there was a fire in Mrs. Gottbaum 's gas range . When things begin , they do not stop , I 'll tell you that . " When Finkel had opened the door , he walked into the apartment and sat down . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision ? " Perlman told him that he had n't given the matter much thought . " All right , all right , " Finkel said , wagging his finger at Perlman , " but do n't say I did n't give you a chance ! Time is time , Professor . It goes . " Then suddenly he was on his feet , inspecting the bookcases . " A fine library , " he said . " Let me ask you something  --  what is your opinion of the relation of art to death ? " " Of what  --  ? " " Forgive me . I do not always put these things well , but I have been thinking . I read your new book on Freud last week  --  very , very fine , Professor  --  and it led me to some thoughts of my own . Vague , of course . But here : the relations of pleasure and pain , love and hate , and even , as you point out so magnificently , of pleasure and death  --  does this not lead one to contemplatethe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut him off . " If you 'll excuse me , Mr. Finkel  --  I have a great deal of work to do " " Of course , of course . Why you even bother with an old fool like me , I do n't know  --  a man like yourself ! " He went to the door and opened it . " But we are old men and we are Jews . We know . We know , do n't we ? " Then he winked and smiled broadly . " Beyond the pleasure principle , eh , Professor Perlman ? Beyond the pleasure principle ! " For about a week after that , Perlman managed to avoid Finkel ; then , in the apartment , things suddenly began goingp80wrong  --  the lock jammed , a fuse blew , a fire started in an electricaloutlet . Every day something required Finkel 's service , and Perlman was certain that , while he was teaching , Finkel was going through the apartment , arranging the accidents . Perhaps , he thought , if he could prove that Finkel was plotting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every morning he left a matchstick standing inconspicuously against the door . When he returned home , however , the matchstick was still standing and , invariably , something was awry in the apartment  --  no hot water , a broken window , a jammed buzzer , another fuse blown , the toilet overflowing . Perlman remembered a movie he 'd seen ; he plucked a hair from his head and , with saliva , pressed it across the crack separating the door from its jamb . It remained intact . He continued to need Finkel 's service . At night he hardly slept , and when he did he dreamed and woke , one dream after the other . He kept a pad on the nighttable and wrote some of the dreams down , hoping , by analyzing them , to obtain the objectivity which would make them cease , but it was useless , and he soon gave it up . In the bathroom , between dreams , he listened to the young lovers , and each day he grew more tired , more tense , more run down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamt of her almost every night ; in the dreams they were always young and they would kiss endlessly , sweetly , warmly . Then , during finals week  --  he had been living in the apartment for almost two months  --  he woke up in the middle of the night , unable to breathe , terrified . He was lying on his side and behind him , he was certain , in the bed , was Naomi . He could hear her breathing . Something heavy lay on his chest ; pains worked their way up his right arm . Had he been dreamingabout her again ? He could n't remember . Things were confused . He only knew that he felt her in the room with him and that he would not turn to see if she was , in fact , really in thep81bed . He gagged on something , coughed . A hundred years from now they would be able to freeze him , he thought , to preserve his quarter inch of cortex . He felt that he was falling swiftly into a moonless black , deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to a vague consciousness . He concentrated and after a moment placed it  --  from " Night Crow " by Theodore Roethke  --  and this seemed to help . He rose and stumbled into the bathroom , drinking hungrily from the faucet . Then he sat on the edge of the bathtub . What time was it ? His young lovers were busy . " I really have to go , " she said . " I mean it . . . oh , stop that . . . " Laughter , coaxing from the boy . Perlman inhaleddeeply . " Naomi , Naomi , " he said . " Oh , Naomi ... " From the grating the girl moaned , then yelped . " Do n't bite . . . damn it , I told you I did n't like that . . . Oh , come on , baby . . . I 'm not your baby . . . Come on , baby ... " Was it the same boy , or a new one ? He wanted to return to bed but he was desperately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moaning had been replaced by what sounded like a struggle . " Stop  --  you 'll tear it . . . Oh , damn ! See ! .. . C'm on , baby , it wo n't hurt . . . I told you to stop . . . Oh , please do n't , do n't . . . " Perlman exhaled , put the plastic drinking cup down above the sink , and rubbed his arm . The pain was still there . The girl 's voice was louder . " Do n't . . . I do n't want to . I mean it ! " They thudded against a wall , the floor , the girl was crying . " Please . . . oh , my God ! Stop ! .. . I mean it . . . I ca n't . . . Oh , oh . . . " Perlman lifted himself , stepping onto the toilet seat to get closer to the grating . The girl was crying hysterically . Then she was screaming . " You 're hurting me . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please . . . " He heard something that sounded like slapping , then heavy breathing , then the girl 's tears , and a sudden scream which tore through his skull . He had to do something , but which apartment was the sound coming from  --  above ? below ? next door ? Finkel would know . " Please . . . please , please ... Oh , God , stop . . . Stop ! " He walked back to the bedroom and , looking at the bed , he felt his heart jump  --  the clutteredblankets , he realized , looked like the shape of a woman . He switched on the light . The room was empty . He put on his robe and slippers and raced from the room into the hallway . He heard his heart galloping . The elevator was waiting for him and he took it to the basement . He rushed down the corridor , pushing against the wall to support himself . His legs were terriblyweak and he realized that he could not see well . He had forgotten his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , forward and back . He turned the corner . Finkel 's apartment was at the end of the corridor , near the garbagecans . He heard a low sound , a growling . He stopped , then continued . A shape rose up from behind the garbage cans . It was Sasha , but he seemed neither old nor friendly nor feeble . Did he think Perlman was a prowler ? He snarled viciously  --  then he streaked toward the professor and , his eyes blazing with fire , leapt for the throat . When Perlman opened his eyes , Barbara was sitting on the bed next to him , rubbing her hand gently across his forehead . Finkel stood behind her , his brow wrinkled with worry . Perlman was in his own room . " Naomi was here with me , " he said to Barbara . She told him to lie quietly , to rest . " Not really , of course , but I felt her here , in the room with me  --  " " And who is to say she was n't here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is  --  " Perlman sat up . " Get out , " he said . " Get out  --  " " But , Daddy , it was Mr. Finkel who found you lying in the basement and telephoned me . " " Not me  --  Sasha . He came for me , " Finkel said . " He is old  --  but he is a good dog . Who knows how long he licked your face and watched over you ? "  | " Get out  --  ! " Perlman repeated . " But , Daddy  --  " " Shah ! " Finkel said to her . " I will go . He is not himself , but he will be all right . It is nothing . Why , the great Freud himself was subject to periodic fainting spells . " " Get out ! " Perlman was screaming . " Get out ! Get out ! " Finkel stood at the door , Sasha with him , looking old , mournful . " Still , we must make plans , Professor . We  --  " Perlman started from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Out ! " he screamed . " Out , out , out . .. " The door closed . " If not for Mr. Finkel , you might be dead by now , " Barbara said . " Sometimes I do n't understand you , Daddy . Honestly . " She paused . " And the man admires you so much , the least you could do  --  " " All right , all right , " Perlman said , closing his eyes . " Peace , Barbara . Some peace . " He stayed in bed the next day . Barbara made his meals and insisted on being with him . She slept in the living room and studied for her examinations . The following day Perlman resumed his activities and , strangely enough , he felt better than he had at any time since Naomi 's illness had begun the year before . He did not try to avoid Finkel , but he did not see him either . Was Finkel avoiding him ? Once , when he met him at the mailbox at noon , Finkel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was quiet . He told Perlman that Sasha was very ill . " The end is in sight , Professor . " Two afternoons later , returning from a committee meeting , Perlman saw a truck in front of the building . Two men in white carried a stretcher into it . Finkel leaned against the gray concrete . He wore no hat . Perlman watched him from across the street . The men closed the door of the truck and drove away . Finkel did not move . Then Perlman saw the children approaching . They seemed to come from everywhere  --  from upp84and down the street , from the building , the cellar  --  there must have been twenty to thirty of them , and they came cautiously . Finkel 's chin was at his chest . He looked at the children and smiled . They moved closer . An instant later , following the lead of the older ones , they had formed a ring around him , and as they skipped in the circle , holding hands , they sang : " Finkel 's dog is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hi-ho the cherrio . . . Finkel 's dog is dead ... " Perlman watched for a few minutes , unable to move . Then he crossed the street , pushed the children aside , and entered the circle . " Mr. Finkel , " he began . " Let  --  " " Ah , Professor  --  what are words at times like these ? Bah ! Death is death . They will return the ashes to me tomorrow . " Perlman felt his stomach turn , but he did not move away . The children continued around the two men , chanting . " Finkel 's dog is dead . . . Finkel 's dog is dead . . . " A crowd was gathering  --  students , mothers with baby carriages , people from the building . " Now that school is over , " Perlman said , " I 'll be leaving for the summer . To Italy  --  Florence , Venice . . . Barbara is coming with me . " Finkel nodded . The voices of the children grew louder , entering Perlman 's brain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finkel was right . " I 'll send the rent checks by mail . " Finkel looked at him from his old face , puzzled . " And I 'll see you again in the fall , I hope . " Finkel gazed at him intensely , his eyes screwed up , searching the professor 's face ; Perlman could not bear it , he realized , and he moved away quickly . Finkel followed him from the circle , pushing the children aside roughly . " I will look forward to it , " he called . His voice was strong . " Have a pleasanttrip , Professor Perlman !  --  Have a pleasant trip ! " P85IF PA HAD N'T of been such a stickler on money , we might of got away with the whole thing and I would n't of got my picture in the papers so that all the kids teased the life out of me in the schoolyard for two weeks afterwards . But maybe it did n't matter about the money , because Pa said if that was what his mother wanted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't any man could stop him . I agreed . When Pa set his mind to doin ' something , nobody could stop him . And if he promised you he 'd do something for you , he did it . Ma always tells how that 's how they got married , on account of Pa 's promise . When he was almost thirty and she was n't even as old as I am now and she was Tom Wilkins ' kid sister ( Tom 's my Pa 's oldest and best friend ) , Pa used to bounce her up and down on his knee and she used to make him promise not to get married till she grew up . So he waited . Ma thinks it 's real funny he did and she always tells the story in front of Pa but he do n't laugh much . Sometimes he 'll smile a bit , but most of the time he just sort of grunts . He 's never once broken a promise he made to me either , and that includes gettin ' strapped.  |p86So  I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing . Pa 's a big one on principles . He 's got lots . I do n't understand most of them that have to do with politics and religion , but I knew that his principle this time was a good one . I would of told him that too if he 'd asked me , but Pa , he do n't need no encouragement . Ma , she did n't say anything either . When the time come she just packed up a lunch for the three of us , put on her Sundayclothes , and told me to wash and comb my hair . I did n't feel like arguin ' , so I did . " Now go help your Pa " So I did that , too  --  I was meaning to the first thing when it happened . Grandma was n't a very big lady  --  not even as tall as I am now . I 'm twelve and Grandma was eighty something . I 'm not sure how much . I did n't like to kiss her . Her skin sort of hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just all gon na fall off sometime , or stick to my lips . She lived in the room in back of the kitchen . Nobody ever went in there until she died , and she just used to show up three times a day for meals , once a day after school so I could give her her kiss and she could ask me if I knew my multiplication tables ( I could n't understand that too well , ' cause I 'd known my tables ever since third grade , and she always asked for the same ones  --  seven and nine  --  and she always stopped me before I finished anyway ) , and once every night she 'd come into the living room and talk with my Ma while they watched TV together . They got along real well , laughing and stuff , but Pa never did say much to her , except to ask what he could do for her . It did n't even seem like she needed much done for her , really . She hardly ate a peck and always wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured the least he could do for her was to do the one thing she 'd asked him to do . Me , I did n't argue . When she died that morning , Pa justP87said , " Let 's go , " and he did n't have to say any more . Ma 's buttingin about washing and stuff just wasted time from getting things done quick and proper , the way Pa always does things . " Quick and proper , " he always says , " that 's the only way to get things done . " " You get the feet . " Pa carried her under the shoulders and it hardly felt like she weighed anything . Getting her into the back seat , I had to let go of one of her legs to open the door , and it bumped on the ground . I knew how careful and respectful you 're supposed to be to dead people , and I looked up quick at Pa . " What are you waiting for ? " " Nothin ' , " I said . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front door and walked down the steps past the garden . " Grandma always loved my roses , " Ma said , picking one . She fixed it between Grandma 's hands . Pa nodded . " Get in , " he said . Ma got in the front seat and I got in the back next to Grandma and leaned up against the front seat and watched Pa drive . He 's the best driver I ever seen . When the speed limit 's sixty-five he keeps the car at a steady seventy the whole time . It never goes more'n a mile over or under . Ma does n't like him to drive fast , but she did n't say anything this time . She knew better . I kept my eyes on Pa 's foot to watch how he regulates it to keep the speed so even . I bet if you put a feather on Pa 's foot it 'd stay there for a thousand miles . Except sometimes when he really lets her rip -- that 's when we go for rides together , just the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes when we 're on a straightaway he keeps his foot on the gas and even lets me turn the wheel . You ought to read the speedometer then  --  Ma 'd have fits if she ever saw how fast we go . He 's never even got one ticket in his whole life . YouP88ought to hear him talk to a cop  --  it 's like with the argument over the money . He 's like that over everything . Around our way he 's known as Loghead Harris . Not to his face , of course , but I never seen a man could beat him in an argument . He 's almost always right about who 's gon na win the footballand baseball games , and even though he belongs to the Electrical Workers Union and always talks about how the Depressionwould n't of come if Al Smith had been President , he 's got some Republican friends , and he always predicts who 's gon na win for President and things . Even when Truman won , he knew it . And nobody 's more loyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball team last spring and helped Jim Evans ' father put on his new roof and last winter during the big snowstorm when nobody knew what to do he delivered Mary Burns ' baby right in her bedroom with everybody yelling and screaming . I do n't think anybody even realized he 'd done it all till him and me ( I helped bring him hot water and blanketsand stuff ) were back in our own house . He did n't say anything then either but just flicked on the TV and told the weatherman off . That was when the phone rang and they thanked him . He was right then , too  --  I mean about the weather , ' cause the weatherman said it would stop by the morning and my Pa told him he was full of it , that it would go until the next night and then some . I like Pa . Even though he do n't talk to me much the way he used to . I think that 's ' cause he wishes he were younger ( he married my Ma when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's gon na do when he retires from working in a few years . There 's lots to do around the house , but I know there 's not really enough and even a good argument with Tom Wilkins every day wo n't really keep him busy and I 'm kind of scared , ' cause he has some temper and I 'm afraid if he 's around all the time he 'll find out about my smoking and even if he do n't he 'll find something to get after me for.  |p89Anyway  , after a while Ma give me a sandwich and a plum . The sandwich was peanut butter without much jelly . It was real dry and I wanted a Coke but Pa did n't want to stop . He said he wanted to get to the funeral parlor before five o'clock . So we just kept driving on down toward Kentucky . The car radio was busted and I was getting bored so I counted the number of silos I could see going by and then I asked some questions about Grandma when she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was only leading up to the big question , though , and when I asked that one , Pa answered . " Because she wanted to be buried in Kentucky next to Grandpa on the same day she died . " He said it so gruff-like that I just shut up and counted silos again . He was n't angry , though . I could tell that . Just doing what he felt he had to do . Which I guess I can understand , since some day when my Ma dies I 'd like to do somethingnice for her , too  --  not nice only , but something special that she 'd like and be proud of me for . I 'll have a lot of money by then and make her a real good funeral , maybe like the one they gave Bill Rooney 's dad last year , with all these black Cadillac limousines . Unless she wants it in our own house . I 'd even do it there , if that 's what she wants . I could tell when we were getting near Louisville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pa went to a union convention , and I remembered especially the bridge going across the state line , because I thought it would be all modern , only it was more like a wood bridge made out of old gray steel girders and I remembered how it was metal underneath too and I was scared the trucks coming the other way would slide into our lane . I should of been scared of other things , ' cause that was when Pa began to stick up for his principles . " That 's a dollar , mister , " the policeman at the tollbooth said when we 'd drove up and stopped . Pa had handed him seventy-five cents . " There 's four of you . "   " She do n't count , " Pa said , pointing to Grandma . " She 's dead . " " Look , mister , quit the kiddin ' and fork over another quarter . There 's cars behind you . " But Pa would n't pay for anyone he did n't have to and the policeman finally got out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Grandma . He looked at me too with a funny kind of smile , like he was half mad and half sick . I did n't smile back at him , though , seeing the way he talked to Pa . The policeman , he got all excited , yellin ' at Pa and goin ' back and forth to the tollbooth , making telephone calls . My Pa and the policeman argued quite a bit , Pa standin ' his ground . He would n't back down . Me , I looked out the back window at all the cars lined up behind us . They were honkin ' away and I felt pretty important , being in the car that was holding everything up . Ma just sat there and looked straight ahead . I guess she was proud of Pa , too . He sure did his damndest to save that quarter . He told the guy all kinds of reasons about how hearses did n't pay and how if dead people counted , why were n't they included in censuses , and then the policeman started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a certificate . But Pa argued about that , too . He told him how it was his mother and he could do what he wanted with her , especially since what he wanted was only what she wanted him to do . He did n't see how it was anybody else 's business . I agreed . Nobody'sgonna be able to tell me what to do with my Ma when she dies . Pa kept talkin ' to the man in the tollbooth and before long more police cars were there and we had to turn around and go to this little town a mile or two away and I stood around in this doctor 's waiting room while Pa kept insisting he was only letting them do it to save time ( he did n't flinch a bitP91when they spoke about being able to put him in jail for what he did ) . Ma stayed in the car . I tried to duck the first time a guy took a picture but the second flashbulb went off before I even saw the sneaky guy , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a pine box and put her into the trunk they got another picture . If I knew it was gon na get into the papers that the kids from school 's parents read , I would of punched the guy . But the main thing was that we got away without Pa going to jail and that we got into Kentucky to Grandma 's funeralparlor before five o'clock . It was n't much of a funeral  --  just the three of us and an old friend of Grandpa 's who looked like he was at least a hundred years old and the minister and this nice old man who owned the parlor and give me some candy . I never saw Pa so serious . Ma neither . I guess she knew Pa done right . Even when the kids teased me and showed the picture around I did n't mind too much , ' cause I remembered how proud Pa was all the way home . Kind of relaxed too  --  I have n't seen him like that for a long time . He let me sit in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had fried shrimp and a Coke and Pa kept winkin ' at Ma  --  not really smiling , but just proud , and repeating what he said to the policemanat the tollbooth the second time when he handed him seventy-five cents : that he guessed that was the right amount unless they were gon na stop the line again and look in the trunk . Pa was right . Nobody looked in the trunk.  |p93Eddie  Gottlieb moved into my neighborhood in the fall of 1955 and I knew right away we were going to becomepretty good friends . I was in the eighth grade then , at P.S. 92 , and Eddie was brought into my official class about two weeks after school had started . At that time I was going through what my parents called one of my " growing periods "  --  always talking out in class , making some wiseacre remark , or doing something stupid to get attention , and for this I 'd been rewarded with a seat right in front of the teacher 's desk , with nobody allowed to sit next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , so when our teacher , Mrs. Demetri , told us that we were going to get a new boy in our class I figured he 'd be sitting next to me . Our official class had n't changed much since first grade and it was always a big event when somebody new came into it . When I saw Eddie walk through the door behind Mr. Weiner , the assistant principal , though , my heart jumped . I could tell right away he was a good ballplayer . He was very tall and lanky  --  about six two then  --  with thick curly hair that reachedP94down into the collar of his shirt . He sort of shuffled into the room , moving very slowly , his body swaying from side to side , his arms swinging freely . They were real long , coming down just about to his kneecaps . He kept staring at the floor , and when we all started laughing and giggling he must have thought we were laughing at him , because he blushed and fidgetedwith his hands and feet a lot  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way Eddie looked but at the way he looked coming in behind Mr. Weiner , and I think Mr. Weiner knew it , because his face got red and angry . He was only about five foot one or two and when he walked he took huge steps , almost as if he were goose-stepping . At lunchtime we would always prance around the schoolyard or the lunchroom , mimicking him , and the teachers would never try very hard to make us stop . He was already at Mrs. Demetri 's desk , right in front of me , and Eddie was only a couple of steps away from the door when he whirled around and glared at him . " What 's taking you so long ? " he demanded . " Come here ! " Then , I remember , Eddie grinned broadly and in two giant steps he was in front of Mr. Weiner , towering over him , standing at attention , still grinning . We broke into hysterics . Mr. Weiner glared at us and we stopped . " Now , young man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off your face . What are you  --  some kind of gangling idiot ? " Eddie shrugged . " I do n't know , " he said . We laughed again and Mr. Weiner turned on us . " All right then . Who wants to be the first to have a private conference in my office today ? " he asked . We shut up . Eddie was staring at the floor again . I could tell that he knew he had done something wrong  --  but it was obvious he did n't know what it was . " What 's that in your pocket ? " Mr. Weiner asked him , pointing.  | " A baseball . " " Let me see it . " Eddie put his lunchbag on my desk and twisted the ball out of his side pocket . He showed it to Mr. Weiner . When Mr. Weiner reached for it , though , Eddie pulled his hand away . " Let me have it , " Mr. Weiner demanded . " No , " Eddie said , and he put his hand behind his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the printing that it was an Official National League ball . It looked really beautiful ! " I said let me have it ! " Eddie shook his head sideways . " It 's mine , " he said . Everybody was perfectly quiet . I glanced across the room at Izzie and Corky and Louie . They were on the edges of their seats . " Young man , you will let me have it by the time I count three or I will know the reason why ! " " Do you promise you 'll give it back ? " Eddie asked . Mr. Weiner blinked . " Do I what  --  ? " Eddie was looking at Mr. Weiner now , intently . " I got ta have it , " he said . " I just got ta ! I never go anywhere without it . " " We do not allow hardball playing in this school . " Eddie grinned then , as if everything were okay , and brought the ball out from behind his back . " I did n't know that , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed the ball right in front of Mr. Weiner 's face . We all gasped and Mrs. Demetri took a step toward them . " See  --  ? " Eddie said , smiling . " It 's got Campy 's signature on it . " " Who ? " " Campy ! " Eddie said . " Who , may I ask , is Campy ? " " Campy  --  Roy Campanella  --  he catches for the Dodgers ! " Eddie was excited now . " You know  --  "  | " Of course , " Mr. Weiner said . Then he smiled awkwardly . There was something about Eddie that had him mystified . You could tell . " Well , put that ball away and do n't bring it to school again , " he said . " This is your first day here , so I 'll excuse you . But there are no second chances with me . Rememberthat . " When he left , Mrs. Demetri introduced Eddie to us . I applauded and most of the guys followed my lead . Mrs. Demetridid n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after she gave Eddie the seat next to me , she put me in charge of getting him his books and making sure he knew where things were . Maybe she figured I 'd be less trouble that way . At any rate , I was glad . The first thing I did was to ask him where he 'd gotten the baseball . " I won it , " he said . " Where ? " " On Happy Felton 's Knothole Gang . " " Really ? " Eddie nodded and I nearly exploded out of my seat , I remember , wanting to tell all the guys . The Knothole Gang was this show they had on television then that came on before all the Dodger games . Three or four guys who played the same position would get together with Happy Felton and one of the Dodgers down the right-field line and they 'd be tested on different things . Then , at the end , the Dodger would pick one of the guys as a winner and give the reasons he 'd picked him . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling him about our baseball team , The Zodiacs . He said he 'd read about us in Jimmy O'Brien 's column in the Brooklyn Eagle . " You got that good pitcher , do n't you  --  and that crazy kid who brings a victrola to the games and plays the Star-Spangled Banner on it  --  right ? "  | " That 's Louie , " I said , pointing across the room . " He lives in my building . But we do n't have the pitcher any more . He 's in high school now . Izzie pitches for us most of the time this year . " We talked some more and I asked him if he wanted to play with us , as long as he was in our class now , and he said he 'd love to , if we 'd let him . Then I wrote out a note , telling all the guys that Eddie had won the baseball on Happy Felton 's show and that he 'd agreed to play on our team , and I passed it across the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed it on to Corky . By the time we got into the yard for lunch that day , Eddie was a hero , and the guys all crowded around him , asking about what Campy had said to him and about what team he had played on before and things like that . I got to know Eddie pretty well during the next few weeks . He was n't very bright  --  this was pretty obvious the first time Mrs. Demetri called on him to read something  --  and he was very quiet , but he would have done anything for you if you were his friend . All the guys liked him and we were pretty happy he had moved into our neighborhood . He was the kind of guy you wished you had for a brother . His father had died a couple of years before , and until he moved he 'd been living in Boro Park with his mother . He never talked much about her or his home or what it had been like living in Boro Park , but we all knew the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time one of us said something to him about makingthe big leagues some day , he shook his head and said that he did n't think he ever would because he could n't play or travel on Saturdays . When we brought up the names of other Jewish ballplayers who 'd played  --  Hank Greenberg , Cal Abrams , Sol Rogovin , Sid Gordon , Al Rosen  --  he said that they had n't come from families like his . He said it would kill his mother if any of his relatives ever found out about the things he did on Saturday  --  that he could hide most things as long as he was n't living near them , but if he ever got his picture in the papers for doing something on Saturday , they 'd know about it . Eddie himself was n't very religious  --  he played ball with us at the Parade Grounds on Saturdays  --  but he was determined not to hurt his mother , and I guess I could understand why at the time . I knew she worked to support the two of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving from their old neighborhood . I guess he felt she had moved because of him . Still , even though he may have felt obligated to her in a lot of ways , it did n't stop him from wanting to be a big-league ballplayer . That was obvious. 1955 was the year the Dodgers beat the Yankees in the World Series , and Eddie came over to my house to watch the games on television . I do n't think I 've ever seen a guy get more excited than he did during the last game of that series . The Dodgers had one of their great teams then  --  Campy , Furillo , Robinson , Reese , Snider , Hodges , Newcombe , Erskine  --  but the heroes of that last game were two other guys , Sandy Amoros and Johnny Podres . When Amoros made his famous catch of Yogi Berra 's fly ball in the sixth inning and without hesitating turned and threw to Reese , who doubled up McDougald at first base , Eddie went wild . He could n't sit down after that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the back , shaking our hands , and repeating again and again : " Did you see that catch ? Boy , did you see that catch ? " We must have relived each inning of that series a hundred times during the rest of that year . I kept telling Eddie that since Podres  --  who had won the third and last games of the series  --  was only twenty-three years old , he 'd still have plenty of years to pitch to Eddie when Eddie got to the Dodgers . Eddie always insisted it was an impossibility , but then Louie came up with another one of his bright ideas  --  if EddieP99changed his name and grew a mustache some day , how would his relatives ever find out ? Eddie liked the idea and that spring , for practice , Eddie used the name Johnny Campy when he played with our team . We played in the Ice Cream League at the Parade Grounds and we did pretty well , even though we did n't win the championship . Eddie was fantastic . He batted over .400 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three errors , threw out ten guys stealing , and did the one thing he did in no other place  --  he talked all the time . He 'd be quiet until we got to the field , but the minute he put on his shin guards , protector , and mask , his mouth began moving a mile a minute , and he 'd keep up the chatter the whole game . I loved to listen to him . " C'm on , Izzie babe , " he 'd yell , crouched behind the plate . " Chuck it here , chuck it here . Plunk it home to Campy , honey babe . Show ' em how , show ' em how . Plunk it home to Campy ! This batter 's just posin ' for pictures . Let 's go , babe . Plunk it home to Campy . . . " He was one of the greatest natural athletes I 've ever seen  --  and not just in baseball , as we soon found out . Until he came to our school Izzie and I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Eddie made us look like amateurs . We were only in the eighth grade then , but when we 'd play in the schoolyard on weekends Eddie could hold his own with the high school and college boys . He was skinny and got banged around a lot under the boards , but he was the most fantastic leaper I 've ever seen . Lots of times , even when he was boxed out , he 'd just glide up in the air , over everybody else , and pluck the ball out of the sky with those big hands of his . He could dunk the ball with either hand . My parents knew how much I loved basketball and that summer , for the second straight year , they sent me to CampP100Wanatoo , where Abe Goldstein , the Erasmus coach , was head counselor . I remember he got pretty upset when I told him that Eddie was supposed to go to Westinghouse  --  a vocational high school  --  instead of to Erasmus . Schoolyard reputations spread pretty fast in our neighborhood and he 'd already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his team . I explained to him about how Eddie 's grades were n't too good , and about his mother . When I got back from camp and saw Eddie , the first thing he told me was that he 'd decided to go to Erasmus . He said that Mr. Goldstein had visited him and promised him and his mother that Eddie would get through high school  --  and that he could get him a scholarship to college . We spent a lot of time that fall playing in the schoolyard together , and Eddie got better and better . He 'd spent the summer in the city , workingas a delivery boy and helper in his uncle 's butcher shop in Boro Park , and he 'd developed a gorgeous fade-away jump shot that was impossible to stop . When we were n't playing , we 'd sit by the fence in the schoolyard and talk about the guys on the Erasmus team or about the Dodgers  --  and we 'd have long debates on whether it was better to get a college educationand then play pro basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a major-league baseball team . That winter we played on a basketball team together in the Daily Mirror tournament and we probably would have won the championship , only in the big game for the Brooklyn title Eddie did n't show up until the last quarter . He went wild then , putting in shots from crazy angles , rebounding like a madman , stealing the ball , and playing his heart out  --  but we were fifteenpoints behind when he arrived and when the clock ran out we were still down by four . For weeks afterwards you could hardly talk to him , he was so upset . All of us told him to forget it , that we understood about his mother getting sick and himP101having to stay with her until the doctor came , but he still felt he 'd let us down . His mother got better , spring came , the baseball season started , and Eddie stopped coming to school almost completely . Any time the Dodgers were in town  --  except for the days our baseball team had a game or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Eddie would be at Ebbets Field . He was always trying to get me to come along with him , but I usually found one excuse or another not to . He kept telling me there was nothing to worry about . He said he knew somebody in the attendance office and that all we had to do was give him our programs and show up for homeroom periodin the morning  --  the guy in the office would write in our names as absent on the sheets that went to the teachers whoseclasses we 'd be cutting . He never seemed to get into any trou- ble and finally , in the middle of June , I told him I 'd go with him . We made up to meet in front of Garfield 's Cafeteria , at the corner of Flatbush and Church , at 1o:30 , after second period . Eddie was there ahead of me and we got on the Flatbush Avenue bus and paid our fares . I kept looking around , expecting to see a teacher or a cop . " Just act normal , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just put one of these on your head  --  " he reached into a pocket and pulled out two yamulkas  --  " and tell whoever asks you it 's a Jewish holiday and that we go to Yeshiva . That alwaysworks . " When we got off the bus at Empire Boulevard , where the Botanic Gardens begin , we still had a couple of hours until the game started and I asked Eddie what we were going to do until then . He smiled . " Follow me , " he said . I followed . I saw a few cops along the street , but none ofp102them bothered us . Some old men were getting their boards ready , with buttons and pennants and souvenirs , and when we got to McKeever and Sullivan Place , where the main entrance was , a few guys were selling programs and yearbooks . We walked along Sullivan Place and Eddie stopped about halfway down the block , where the players ' entrance was . A minute later a taxi stopped at the curb and two big guys got out  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snider . It really surprised me , I remember , to discover that we were as tall as both of them  --  taller than Snider . " Any extra tickets ? " Eddie asked . " Sorry  --  not today , Eddie , " the Duke said , and the two of them disappeared into the clubhouse . I nearly died . " You mean you actually know them ? " I asked . " Sure , " Eddie said . " Hell  --  I 've been out here like this for three years now . " He scratched at his cheek and tried to act nonchalant , but I could tell how proud he was that a Dodger had called him by name with me there . " I do n't think they 'll have any extras today , though  --  Milwaukee has a good team this year and there were probably lots of their friends wanting tickets . " " It 's okay , " I said , still flabbergasted . " I got a couple of bucks for tickets . " " We wo n't need ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody has extras , we can try waiting in the gas station on Bedford Avenue . There 's always a bunch of kids there , hoping to catch a ball , but they usually hit four or five out in batting practice . If we can get just one , the guy at the gate will let us both in  --  he knows me . " " If not ? " He shrugged . " The bleachers . It 's only seventy-five cents , and after about the second inning you can sneak into the grandstands. "  |p103Some  more Dodgers came by and they all smiled and said hello to Eddie , but none of them had any extra tickets . It did n't bother me . After a while I just followed Eddie 's lead and said hello to the players also , saying things like " How 're you doing , Carl ? We 're rooting for you ! " to Furillo , or " How 're you feeling today , Campy ? " and I hardly believed it when some of the players would actually answer me . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wee to watch out for guys sliding into second base , telling Karl Spooner that if he pitched he should keep the ball low and outside to Aaron  --  and after each group of guys would go into the clubhouse I 'd slam Eddie on the back and punch him in the arm . " C'm on , " I 'd say to him , " pinch me right on the ass , buddy . Then I 'll know it 's true ! " Eddie just kept grinning and telling me how stupid I 'd been to wait this long to come to a game with him . By 11:30 , though , we still did n't have any tickets . " We should of waited by the visiting team 's entrance , " Eddie said . " They hardly ever use up their passes  --  " Then , as we started to walk toward Bedford Avenue , we saw this little guy come trotting up the street toward us . Eddie squinted . " It 's Amoros , " he said . " Hey , Sandy  --  any tickets ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late today , " Amoros said when he got to us , shaking his head back and forth . He reached into his wallet , handed us two tickets , and we wished him luck . Then he continuedtoward the players ' entrance , running . " Whooppee ! " I shouted as soon as he was gone . " Amoros for Most Valuable Player ! " I threw my arm around Eddie 's shoulder and we ran down the street together , half dragging each other , until we got to the turnstile entrance . Then we stopped and strutted inside together , handing the guard the tickets as if it was something we did every day of the week . AsP104soon as we were inside , Eddie yelled " Let 's go ! " and we raced under the arcade , laughing and giggling . The instant we saw the field , though , we stopped . The groundkeepers had just finished hosing down the base paths and the visiting team had n't come out yet for batting practice . There was hardly anybody in the stands and the sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . To this day I do n't think there 's any sight that 's prettier than a ball park before a game 's been played . Watching on television all the time , you forget how green and peaceful the field looks . We had great seats that day , right over the Dodger dugout . They blasted the Braves , 9-1 , with fourteen or fifteen hits , and we cheered and shouted like mad , especially when Amoros came to bat . I remember everything about the ball park that day , and I think I remember the things that happened off the field more than I do the actual game . I remember the Dodger Symphony marching around the stands , and Mabel swinging her cowbell , and Gladys Gooding singing the National Anthem and playing " Follow the Dodgers " on the organ , and the groundkeepers wheeling the batting cage back out to center field , and the people across Bedford Avenue watching from their roofs . I remember being surprised at how many guys our age  --  and even younger  --  had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard somebody calling my name and I turned around and saw Mr. Hager wave to me . I waved back at him and then told Eddie about him . Mr. Hager was a retired fireman who lived on my block . He went to every Dodger game and when they lost he always wore a black armband . When the Giants beat the Dodgers in the playoff in ' 51 , nobody saw him for weeks afterwards , and then he wore the same black suit day in and day out until they won back the pennant in ' 52 . Everybody in our neighborhood knew him and it was said that he got into at least two or three fights a week atp105Hugh Casey 's bar on Flatbush Avenue . There were a lot of Dodger fans like him in those days . Most of all , though , I remember how good I felt that day  --  just sitting with Eddie , eating peanuts and cheering and talkingbaseball . As it turned out , that was the last time I ever got to see a Dodger game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were moving to Los Angeles . I went to Camp Wanatoo again that summer and Eddie stayed in the city . His uncle had gotten him a job loading sides of beef into refrigerator cars and this helped build up his chest and shoulders and arms . In the fall everybody was predicting he 'd be the next great basketball star at Erasmus  --  maybe even All-City in his sophomore year . When the time came for varsity tryouts , though , he did n't show up . Nobody could figure it out . Two days later he stopped by my house at night and asked if I wanted to go for a walk . He looked terrible  --  his face was long and he seemed to have lost a lot of weight . At first I figured it had something to do with his mother , but when I asked him he shook his head . " Nah , " he said when we were downstairs . He sighed . " I guess you were wondering why I did n't try out for the team , huh ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Goldstein called my house tonight and I had to tell him  --  that 's why I came by your house . I wanted you to know before the other guys . Maybe you could tell them , so I do n't have to keep repeating the story . " " Sure , " I said . " What is it ? " " It 's my damn heart , " he said . I looked at him and he was biting the corner of his lower lip . Then he shook his head back and forth and cursed . " I ca n't play any more , " he said . " The doctor said so . " He stopped . " Jesus , Howie , what amp106I gon na do ? What am I gon na do ? " he pleaded . I did n't know what to say . " Shit , " he said . " Just shit ! " Then his body seemed to go limp . " C'm on , let 's walk . " " How 'd you find out ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had this pain in my chest and when it did n't go away I went to our family doctor . My mother telephoned him about a week ago and he told her . It 's only a murmur  --  nothing really dangerous  --  but it means no varsity . " " Ca n't you play at all ? " " Oh , yeah  --  as long as I take it easy . I just have to get a lot of sleep , and whenever I feel any of this pressure building up in my chest I have to be sure to stop . " We walked for a long time that night  --  up Bedford Avenueall the way past Ebbets Field to Eastern Parkway , then back home along Flatbush Avenue , and most of the time neitherof us said anything . What could you say ? I made the varsity that year and Eddie came to all the games , home and away . He worked five afternoons a week at his uncle 's butcher shop now , but on Saturdays , when it was closed , he 'd come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He kidded around a lot , telling everybody to take it easy against him because of his heart , but he was still tremendous . I was already about an inch taller than he was , and a pretty good jumper , but he 'd go up over me as if I had lead in my sneakers . In about the middle of our junior year he quit school and went to work full-time as an assistant to his uncle . He kept coming to all the Friday night games , though , and sometimes when I did n't have a date , we 'd go to Garfield 's afterwards and then walk home together . Eddie and I lost touch with each other during my first two years of college  --  I do n't think I saw him even once  --  but when I was home for spring vacation during my junior year myp107mother told me he 'd bought a half interest in Mr. Klein 's kosher butcher shop on Rogers Avenue . I went over to see him the next morning and there he was , behind the counter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait on customers , and then when the store was empty I went inside . " Hey , Campy  --  ! " I called . He was at the far end of the counter , cutting up some meat . He turned around . " Jesus , Howie ! " He wiped his hands on his apron and then we shook hands and pounded each other on the back . " Boy , it 's good to see you . How 've you been ? " " Pretty good , " I said . " When did all this happen ? " I asked , motioning around the store . " C'm on next door to the candy store , " he said , taking off his apron . " I 'll get you a Coke  --  boy , it 's been a long time ! " He got Mr. Klein out of the big walk-in freezer in the back and then we went next door and Eddie told me about how he 'd saved up money while he was working for his uncle  --  with that and some insurance money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was able to buy a half interest from Mr. Klein , who was getting old and wanted to retire soon . By then Eddie could buy out the other half and the store would be his . " How about you ? " he asked . " How do you like college ? " " It 's okay , " I said . " What 're you studying ? " " Liberal arts . " " Oh , yeah ?  --  What subjects ? " I laughed . " You do n't have to sound interested , " I said . He shrugged , embarrassed . " Anyway , I follow your teamin the papers all the time  --  the Times always prints box scoresof your games . You did real well this year  --  second high scoreron your team , were n't you ? " When I did n't answer , he punchedme in the arm . " Ah , do n't be modest  --  you 're a good ballplayer ,  |p108Howie  . Bet you got all those pretty girls running after you , too  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , " I said . " I 'll get you some tickets  --  you can bring a girl and maybe we 'll double after or something  --  " " Sure , " he said . " I 'm going with a girl now  --  real nice , you 'd like her . " He shrugged , then grinned . " I 'll probably be a married man by this time next year  --  " When we played in the Garden the next year I sent him two passes , but I had to leave right after the game to get the bus that was taking us back to school that night . I got an invitation to his wedding right after that . It was scheduled for Christmas week , but I could n't go because of a holiday tournamentour team was playing in at Evansville , Indiana . I called him when I came in for spring vacation and told him how sorry I was that I had n't been there . " Jesus , Howie , " he said . " Forget it . How could you have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed the whole thing . " He laughed . " My wife nearly slammed me becauseon the first day of our honeymoon I rushed out in the morning to get the papers to see how many points you 'd scored . " We talked some more and then he asked me over to dinner . I accepted the invitation , but I felt funny about it . I suppose I was afraid we would n't have anything to talk about  --  or , what seemed worse , that we 'd spend the entire evening reminiscing about things we 'd done when we were thirteen or fourteen . I was partially right  --  we did spend a lot of time reminiscing , but I did n't mind . Eddie and I filled each other in on what had happened to guys we 'd grown up with  --  who was getting married , who had finished college , who had moved out of the neighborhood  --  and I had a good time . Susie was , as Eddie promised , a great cook . She 'd graduated from highp109school and was in her last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought . After supper , while she did the dishes , Eddie and I sat in the living room and talked . I told him how much I liked her and he smiled . " She 's good for me , " he said , nodding . " I 'll tell you something  --  becauseof her I 'm even thinking of going back to high school evenings to finish up . " " Does she want you to ? " " She 'd never say so , even if she did  --  she lets me make up my own mind . But I think she 'd like it . " " Sounds like a good idea , " I offered . " Yeah  --  but when do I have time ? Running the store by myself now , there 's a lot of work  --  books  --  I have to bring home , and then I 'm so tired after being on my feet all day , about all I can do in the evening is turn on the TV and watch the Yanks or the Mets . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to finish up . " " How 's your health been ? " I asked . " Fine , " he said , shrugging . Then his eyes opened wide . " Jesus ! " he exclaimed . " You do n't know , do you ? " " Know what ? " " About my heart  --  " I must have looked scared then , because he started laughing at me . " Thank God Kennedy put through that draft exemption for married men , " he said . " Otherwise I 'd be carrying a rifle  --  " " I do n't understand . I thought  --  " " It 's a long story , " he said , " but the short of it is there was never anything wrong with my heart . " He stood up and paced around the room . " When I went for my army physical about a year and a half ago , they did n't find anything wrong with me . That 's how I found out . " " But what about  --  ? " " Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family doctor went along with , " he said , stopping my question.  | " He was religious or something , I guess . I do n't know . What 's the difference now ? Thinking back , I guess he himself never really told me outright I had a murmur  --  " Susie came back into the room and I could tell she knew what Eddie had been telling me . She put her arms around his waist and hugged him . " My God ! " I exclaimed . " How could she  --  ? " He was about to say something , but then Susie looked at him and he changed his mind . " That 's the way the ball bounces , I guess , " he said , shrugging his shoulders , and I could tell he 'd used the same expression before in similar situations . He kissed Susie on the forehead and held her close to him . " Anyway , " he laughed , " if you 're in pro ball you got to be away from your wife and kids half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I began . Susie glared at me and I stopped . Eddie sat down and nobody said anything for a while  --  then suddenly he started talking . " You know something , " he said . " My business is pretty good . I mean , I 'm making a good living and at least I 'm not working for somebody else  --  but you know what I 'd really like to do ? " He leaned forward and rubbed his hands together . He looked at Susie and she smiled . " I 'd like to coach kids . No kidding . " " He 's terrific with them , Howie , " Susie said . " Really  --  " " I love it  --  I help out at the center sometimes , and with this team of kids from our block . Guess what they call themselves ?  --  The Zodiacs ! " We both laughed . " It 's something how these things get passed down  --  " We began reminiscing again and soon we were both tellingSusie about the day we 'd played hooky together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it since it 's torn down ? " Eddie asked . " They got these big apartment houses  --  " " I 've been there , " I said.  | " I have a girlfriend who lives in right field , " Susie said . I glanced at her , puzzled . " The people all give their section of the development names according to the way the field used to be laid out , " she explained . Then she laughed , but the laugh was forced and we knew it . Eddie and I tried to get up a conversation about the old ballplayers and what they were doing then  --  Hodges managing the Senators , the Duke still hanging on as a pinch hitter , poor Campy in a wheelchair since his crash , conducting interviews on TV between Yankee doubleheaders  --  butour hearts were n't in it anymore and there were a lot of long silences . After a while I said I had to get up early the next morning for a job interview . It was n't even midnight . I thanked them for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got back from school in June . Then , when I was at the door , Eddie put his arm around my shoulder . " I been thinking , " he said . " How about you playing some three-man ball with an old married man before you go back to school ? " " Sure , " I said . I met Eddie at the schoolyard on Saturday morning and we played for a couple of hours . He was n't as graceful as I 'd remembered him , but he could still jump  --  only now he knew how to throw his weight around and use his elbows and body and shoulders . He was murder under the boards and deadly with his jump shot and rough on defense . We played against some pretty tough high school and college and ex-college ballplayersthat day and Eddie was the best of us all . Between games we 'd rest next to the fence together and Eddie would talk and joke and kid about the potbelly he was putting on . When we played , though , he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he played to win.  |p113WE  RACE down the stairs , two at a time , loyal friends behind us , spreading the word . " Vote for Birnbaum and Rodriguez ! ' Viva Sam ! ' Viva Hector ! ' Viva Louise ! " Carlos is standing in the doorway of his room on the second floor , looking at the girls with the others from his class . " i Mira ! ! Mira ! " cries one of his classmates . " Hey , chica  --  Carlos likes you ! " They lean on each other as the crowds go by , drool on their lips , but Carlos says nothing . He 's real little , a stringy guy , but he is my best friend . We come on the boat together from Puerto Rico . I push the others aside and give him my hand to shake . " We made it , " I say . " A fusion ticket  --  Sam , the black girl Louise , and me . " Carlos smiles with his yellow teeth . His eyelidshang down . " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Can we count on you to swing the C.R.M.D. vote our way ? " Carlos shrugs . " It 's okay , " I say , and Carlos says he will get the C.R.M.D. vote in line . C.R.M.D. is for Children with Retarded Mental Development , but do not believe it . Carlos is quick at arithmetic , he knows the lifetime batting averages ofp114every Spanish baseball player . Behind his droopy eyelids there is fire . He wins medals in running . He is as smart as half the school . Only he can not read . So they put him in C.R.M.D. But he does not care . In C.R.M.D. nobody bothers you . There is a television set and shoeshine kits and knock-hockey . He makes much money shining the teachers ' shoes . In his class he is the leader , and now that he is in C.R.M.D. nobody makes fun of the others the way they used to . Except Carmen . Carmen de las tetas grandes , as she is known on our street . Carmen Quinones , five foot two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missiles on her chest . She comes down the hall now , her friends with her , chattering and chewing , swinging their asses to the music from Carmen 's radio . Carmen stops when she sees me , and tosses her head back like she is Sophia Loren. " jQue tetas grandes ! " I exclaim . She sneers at me . Benito Lopez , from Carlos ' class , his eyes are spinning . " Hey , Benito , " Carmen says . " You like me ? " Benito nods , his mouth open , happy . Carmen throws her head back and laughs . " Well , I no like you ! " This causes great laughter from the other girls , and as they pass down the hall Carlos spits in their direction . " 1Puta ! 1Puta ! " he shouts , above the noise . Carmen shakes her oil-black hair and turns on Carlos . " jSu madre es una negra ! " Carlos gives her the sign . She laughs and walks on , around the corner . " How about her ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the female Puerto Rican vote  --  " " You leave her to me , " I say . " Adios , Carlos . I have a class . After school , meet me  --  we have a campaign to plan . " I am the leader of my people  --  Hector Rodriguez , running for vice-president of Junior High School Number 54 ,  |p115Manhattan  , on the Green Party . Everything has gone according to our plans . We are unbeatable . Sam Birnbaum of the ninth grade for president  --  white and Jewish ; Hector Rodriguezof the eighth grade for vice-president  --  Catholic and Puerto Rican ; Louise Carr of the seventh grade for secretary  --  black and Protestant . " I 'm counting on you to bring in the Puerto Rican vote , " Sam says to me , his arm around my shoulderas we make our way downstairs . " Do not fear , " I say to him . " You are my good friend , Sam . " I pound him on the back while all around us students give congratulations . " jViva Rodriguez ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunchroom I get Carmen in the corner . " I like you , Carmen , " I say . She chews on an egg-salad sandwich and presses the radio to her ear . Lesley Gore is singing . " I mean it , " I say . " I go for you . " " Yeah ? " she says . " Well , I no go for you . You better watch out how you get fresh or I get my boyfriend after you . " She telling the truth about that . Her boyfriend , he is the star pitcher for the Camaradas , a windmill delivery , a true strikeoutking . On Saturday in Central Park I see them play . Carmen is there , and when he is not pitching he and Carmen are against a tree , loving each other up with passion . He is meanlooking , with a mustache , at least nineteen years old . All the men on his team have women , and all day in Central Park they love them up and drink beer and play baseball . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . I let my hand fall against la teta grande . She chews her gum and listens to the radio as if I am doing nothing to her . " I like you , Carmen . I mean it . I go for you . " " What you give me if I vote for you ? " she asks . " I make a big party in your honor , " I say . " For you and all your friends  --  a party like you have never been to . Better than the fiestas in San Juan ! "  | " Oh , yeah ? How you do that  --  ? " " Sam , " I say . " His parents are rich Jews who live on CentralPark West . At election time they will be gone , cruising to Puerto Rico with the other rich Jews , and we can use his house , his liquor . I promise you , Carmen  --  you get your friends to vote for us and I will show you a good time  --  " She comes closer , smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my honor ? " " Only for you , Carmen . You know that . Only for you . " She laughs with passion . " Hector ! " she says , grabbing me under the mouth . She flashes her teeth and shakes my head from side to side , holding me strong by the chin . " What a man you will be some day ! Aiee , what you do to me ! " She gives me my hand back . The door to the outside opens and the students charge to it . I walk into the yard and go around to the side with Carmen . With nobody around , I do things she likes . " Okay , " she says . " You make a party for me and I vote for you . " What about your boyfriend ? " I say . She bites my neck . " Ha ! What you think  --  while I am in school he waits only for me ? I know him  --  1 bastardo ! 1 Bastardobarrosol " I press her against the bricks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . " He is old now and I am young , but some day I am going to be somebody . This is the beginning . Vice-president this year , president next year . I have it planned . In high school and then in college . You stick with me , Carmen , you do okay . " " You are smart Hector , " she says . " You in the class with all the Jews . " " Some day I will have a mansion on Riverside Drive and an estate in Puerto Rico  --  servants , yachts , a swimming pool , my own airplane . You think I going to be a dumb spit all my life , you crazy . " I visit la teta grande for the last time . " This is only the beginning , Carmen . "  |p117After  school , in Sam 's house , we begin our work . The smart kids from the Special Progress classes , they are making posters and tags , telephoning their friends . I tell them what to put on the signs : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE STUDENTS ! In English and in Spanish : ! EL PARTIDO DE TODOS LOS ESTUDIANTES ! The good artists draw pictures of us  --  black , Spanish , white ; on the floor in the bedroom , I put Louise in charge of the tags  --  voTE FOR SAM ! . . . I LIKE HECTOR ! . . . GO FOR GREEN . . . cutting them out of paper , punching holes , stringing them for distribution . " Louise is O.K. , " Sam says . Then he asks if I want to take a drink from his father 's supply . Sam is all right . He is my good friend . Some day he will be a famous man  --  he is a scholar and an athlete . In the lavatories of our school , he is the man to come to for a cigarette . We toast to our victory . " C'mere , " he says . " I got something to show you . " In his father 's room , from a dresser , boxes of prophylactics . " Votes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lighting a cigar . I take one . Two girls come in , white and clean , and he issues instructions to them . A new idea for a poster : THIS STUDENT VOTES FOR SAM , HECTOR , AND LOUISE ! We will tape mirrorsto the posters . Sam starts to take money from his wallet to buy the mirrors , but Carlos stops him . He says he will get mirrorsfor nothing . During the next week , we move our campaign into high gear . Every day more and more voters swing to the Green Party . Sam is cheered by the students when he enters the schoolyard , I am hoisted on shoulders and carried about , Louise is queen of the seventh grade . Everyone wears our tags . We start a blackboard campaign , workers assigned to every room in the school . I give speeches in the lunchroom  --  we promise them everything : dances , boat rides , tournaments , picnics . And all the while Carlos is blazing the path to victory with his own campaign . Every day he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the girls , the next day combs for the boys : ballpoint pens , boxes of gold stars , candles , thumbtacks , cans of hair spray , golf balls  --  his resources are endless , his sheepish smile dazzling . Where does one get a friend like Car-los ? In their desperation the other party spreads a rumor  --  Sam and I , they say , we are too close , like little birds . In the bathrooms it is written : Sam Loves Hector . We call a council and I decide quickly . " There is only one thing to do , " I say . " You 've got a head on your shoulders , Hector , " Sam says , and the next day we walk through the schoolyard holding hands . Boys and girls roar with laughter . At the gates at three o'clock , Sam 's friends from the S.P. classes stop one of every five studentsand ask them who they expect to vote for . The polls show us leading by a three-to-one margin , and we publish the results . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It shames them . " When I return to West 8oth Street at night , I am a hero . The Latin-American music I love fills the air . The naked babies run under my feet , the girls grab for my muscles , I am asked to play stickball by the younger boys . My grandmother , proud , sits in the window behind the fire escape and compares me to Roosevelt , Kennedy , Marin . The old men in their undershirts , playing cards and shooting craps , they ask when I am running for mayor . Carmen traps me in the hallway . " You so famous now , you forget about Carmen ? " she asks . " I never forget you , Carmen , " I say , moving in . She shoves me back . " I get all my friends to vote for you and now , in the halls , you hardly see me . " She spits at my feet . " Always with the blond-haired girls ! " " You are the only girl for me  --  j @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold her to me from behind . " This isp119only politics , Carmen . A dirty business . When the election is over and I am vice-president , we will have good times . Do you forgive me ? " " I am Spanish and I am proud of it ! " she says . Her chest expands with pride . My pride matches hers . " There is no one like you , Carmen , " I say . She grabs the hair in back of my head with both hands . " ' Hector ! ! Aiee ! ' Hector ! " she cries . A minute later she runs for the door . " My boyfriend will see  --  " Then , eyes laughing , she is gone into the street . A bottle crashes down from a window and she screams marvelous curses , her head thrown back , her fist raised . At school Carmen tells everybody about the party I am making in her honor . When Carlos hears , he broods . " She alwaysmake fun of us , " he says . I console @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letting him beat me at knock-hockey . The other boys fight each other for the chance to shine my shoes . The teacher leaves me in charge and goes to the lounge to sleep . Everybody knows about him . He was a boxer in the Marines . He has no discipline problems . On the first day of the year , he takes the strongest boy in the class and beats him up . On the second day he makes the strongest boy beat up the next strongest . Who would believe what a C.R.M.D. boy says ? Carloshas a supply of candy bars in the clothes closet . When the period ends , he goes into the hall with his chocolates , gettingvotes for me . Carmen comes toward us , her radio blasting , her body swaying . " Hey Hector , " she says , and points to Carlos . " You let this moron vote for you ? " Then Carlos curses Carmen 's mother . Carmen flies at him , her nails rip into the side of his face , and a minute later the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his face when he sees that Carmen 's sweater is torn down the middle . He covers her with his jacket and she stridesp120through the crowd with him , her jaw thrust forward . Carlos is bloody . I put my arm around his shoulder and he twists away . " jTraidor ! " The words cut into my heart . " Carlos . Please  --  " But my words will not reach him . The nurse is escorting him away from me . His head is bent , his body tired . When he leaves the school at three o'clock , he sneaks along the fence . " Is this the Carlos I know ? " I say to him , walking by his side . " Is this the Carlos who leaped into the giant war canoe at the Museum of Natural History ? " I see a faint spark in his eyes , but it is nothing like the flash that was there when he led the charge into the canoe . I fan the spark . " Is this the Carlos who ran five miles every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His head lifts . " Is this the Carlos who receivedthe praise of the fishermen for the way he sewed their nets ? " We go into Central Park . Sam is waiting for us and we rent a rowboat . Carlos takes the oars and heads for open waters . When we are past the bridge , Sam reveals his newest book : Ideal Marriage , Its Physiology and Technique . " I copped it from my father 's study . " He reads and Carlos and I go into a trance . The words are glorious : vestibule of the vagina .. . phenomenon of erection . . . first intermezzo of aphorisms ... the love-bite . . . This is what we have been waiting for . The chapters : Positions , Converse and Averse . . . Communionand After-Glow . . . Contraception .. . From the corner of my eye I see Carmen and two friends coming toward us in a boat . Carlos sees them also , and he rows furiously . We ram their boat at full speed , and as they work to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey , Carlos  --  you mad at me ? " Carlos sulks . " Rafaela say she like you . You like her ? " From behind Carmen , Rafaela smiles shyly . " I got something for you , Carmen , " I say , and hold upp121the book . Sam laughs . I suggest that we switch boats . The girls say they do n't know , but Carmen 's eyes dance and Rafaela blushes . We line our boat up alongside theirs . " Come on , " I say . " I give you a good time  --  we race our boats and ram each other and things . " They agree . Carmen will come in our boat and Carlos will go into theirs with Rafaela . " I help you , " I say . Carmenstands up . Sam holds onto their boat . I give her my hand and she steps toward us . Then Carlos ' eyes blaze , he shrieks into the air  --  " jAiee ! jPuta ! 1Ramera ! "  --  and with superhuman strength he shoves his oar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hold onto Carmen 's hand . Her eyes and mouth open wide , her skirt flares out , space appears between our boats , and then , her legs spread wide like the sides of a triangle , she descendswith a great splash into the water of the Central Park Lake . Carlos rows like ten men , his eyes sparkling . Carmen rises to the surface , screaming curses. " 1Bastardo ! jldiota barroso ! " Even from a great distance , as boats speed to her rescue , I can see the fire in her eyes . " I get you ! " she yells . " I get you ! " Carlos ' grin will not leave . But Sam does not smile . " Could n't you wait till after the election ? " he asks . I sit next to him in the rear of the boat , my arm over his shoulder . I tell him there is nothing to worry about . I have calculated . Even withoutall of Carmen 's votes , we will win by a handsome margin . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the election  --  but the victory party . " My heart swells . " It will be a party no one will ever forget . " I take the book from Sam . " Is it not for us to see to the educational needs of our students ? " I explain my idea and his face is alive again . He pounds me on the back and praises my imagination . He is prepared to take risks , he says . We bring our boat in and sit at the cafe which overlooks the lake , eating hot dogs and plotting our adventureon Department of Parks napkins . Sam smokes a cigar ,  |p122Carlos  looks at the illustrations in the book , and I lean back , satisfied . At school we let it be known that we are the educational party , and when I reveal our plans to Carmen she says she will swing her girls back to our side . She says she does not hold us responsible for Carlos ' actions . We proceed with our plans . At four o'clock we meet outsideMr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy , Ringo , Fidel . When the store is empty , we slip inside andI put the sign on the window : STORE CLOSED . WILL OPEN AGAIN AT 5 . Carlos is lookout . I draw the shades . Mr. Weiss laughs when he sees our masks . " What can I do for you boys ? " We tell him what we want and he laughs again . With one sweep of my arm I clear a counter of its merchandise . I show him our briefcases , open and empty . He goes for the phone , but Sam is ready and cuts the cord with his scissors . " The pills , " I say . His eyes dart this way and that . I show him in the book . " The pills ! " I repeat . " Your daughter , she in my class  --  you want her safe ? " " My God ! " he says . " Who are you ? " " The pills ! " Sam says in his most vicious voice . He splatersbottles of perfume against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him he will help the population problem , keep innocent girls out of trouble , prevent half-breeds . He fills our briefcases with pills . We head for the door . " There are men planted across the street , " I say . " If you leave here during the next hour , you will pay . " " I want diagrams , " Carlos says . " I do n't trust pills . " Give him what he wants , " Sam says . " All sizes . " We stay at the door while Carlos gets what he wants . Behind the face of John F. Kennedy there are happy eyes . " Let 's beat it , " Sam says . We leave the store and take our masks off , stuffing themp123into a garbage can . We proceed up Columbus Avenue . Then , coming toward us , we see them  --  three cops . " Act natural , " I say , but when we come to them , they stop us . " Let 's see what you got in those briefcases , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling triumphantly . Sam looks at me . I look at Carlos . " Now ! " I say , and we break from the cops and run down Columbus Avenue . Carmen grabs at Carlos but he kicks her to the curb . " Stop or we 'll shoot ! " I hear . We turn the corner , into a side street , streaking between cars . But it is no use . More cops are in front of us . " This way , " I cry , and we head into an apartment building , knocking over the ancient doorman . Carlos stops . " I stay here and make trouble , " he says . I look into his eyes . " It 's the only way , Hector . You and Sam are leaders  --  you must not get caught . " " Carlos  --  " I say . " Go ! " he says . " Carlos  --  ! " He kicks at me as the cops appear in the doorway . We open the door to the courtyard . " If you shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or gun . Remember Gilligan the cop ! " " Come quietly , kid , and we wo n't hurt you , " they say . " C'm on ! " says Sam . I look at Carlos , my friend . " Good luck  --  " I call . Just as the police go for him , he turns and tosses me his briefcase . " The diagrams ! " he yells , and then he has slipped between them and is running like a maniac , in circles , screeching Spanish . Sam and I leave , satchels in both my hands . The police open the door to the courtyard , but Carlos throws himself between their legs . We hurry down and journey through a network of cellars , making our way to freedom . At night I confer with the man who protects the rights of the Puerto Rican people . He is my friend , and he says he willp124represent Carlos . Jail , he believes , can not be avoided . I have my own idea , though , and we discuss it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' teacher testifies that he is truly a C.R.M.D. , Carlos attacks the court psychiatrist , he sings dirty Spanish songs while the judge speaks , his grandmother tells of a home with ten children and no father , and the man who protectsthe rights of the Puerto Rican people makes an eloquent speech about sickness instead of sin , help instead of punishment . The plan works . Carlos is sent to a state hospital . The hospital is far away on Long Island and Sam and I travel there on Sunday afternoon when all the other families come , their shopping bags filled with food and clothing , their eyes glazed . Carlos is happy to see us , but he can not shake our hands . He is tied in a strait-jacket . Around us the other patients and visitors communicate with each other . All the attendants are Negro and Puerto Rican and Carlos says they take special care of him . He asks how the election is going and we tell him that his heroicact has made our victory certain . He asks me what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the strait-jacket and I tell him he is doing fine . I ask him if he wants anything . He says he wants to return to Puerto Rico . We go back to the city in the hot subway . Everybody is out on my street . They ask me about Carlos . Children are playing with the garbage , the men are drinking beer , and music fills the air . Everybody is talking about Mr. Sanchez , who threw his baby against the wall that afternoon . The police have taken him away . Carmen 's big sister , her hair bleached a crazy pink color , comes switching down the street , looking for business . It is too hot . Everybody is sweaty and greasy . Under a lamppost she comes to me . " When you get some money , kid , " she says , " I be your first . Okay ? I give you a good time . "  | " Carmen gives it to me for nothing , " I say . " She gives it to everybody for free . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go home but I roll around on my bed in the hot room and I can not sleep . On the next visiting day I see that Carlos is changing . He does not smile . His eyes are almost closed , his neck is stiff . We tell him that we will wait until he comes out to have the victory party . He does not listen . He says that if he can not go back to Puerto Rico he will stay in the hospital . He says it is not so bad in the hospital . It is like C.R.M.D. " I stay here a long time , " Carlos says . " I getting to like it here . " The next Sunday we come with good news . We have won the election . " Hector had it figured right , " Sam says . " It was a land-slide . " " Now we wait for you to return , " I say . " So that we can have the victory party . " " If I get out , I kill Carmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " I talk to him about the party we are going to make  --  the food , the music , the girls . " We got you to thank for being where we are , " Sam says . " I din do nothing , " Carlos says . We keep talking to him , building his confidence , telling him what we feel . I speak to one of the Spanish attendants and point out to him how calm Carlos has become . " Carlos , " I say . " If you say you will not make trouble , Mr. Garcia will take the jacket off . " " I no make trouble . " The jacket comes off , but Carlos continues to sulk , and I have little hope for him . He talks of only two things , the return to Puerto Rico and the murder of Carmen . When we are readyp126to leave , he asks if we will do his laundry for him and we say yes . He goes to his room and returns with a bundle of clothes . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thin body stiff , and I wonder if I do the right thing . Maybe he be better off in jail . " Tomorrow in assembly they swear us in , " Sam says when we are standing at the corner of Columbus Avenue and 8oth Street . Downstairs in the basement my people are singing with Pastor Ayala . The neon lights blink on and off : IGLESIA DE CRISTO MISIONERAVIDA STERNA , INC . The sound of electric guitars and tambourines fills me with joy . " Yes , " I say , and finger my medallion . The music is fierce . " It 's really something , " Sam says . " We have what we want  --  but with Carl where he is , it does n't seem to matter , does it ? " " No , " I say . Carmen is standing against a building , in the shadows , alone . She comes to me and I spit . " Go walk the streets , " I say . " Like your sister . " " Hector , " she pleads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam slaps her . " Your mother sniffs bicycle seats , " he says . " Please , " says Carmen , but I turn my back on her . She walks away from us , slowly . I feel something for her  --  but it passes . Her old friends exit from the church and shun her . They say they have prayed for Carlos . Rafaela says she sends candy and cards to the hospital . Everybody wants to visit him . I look beyond our circle of friends and see Carmen fade into the lights and noise of Columbus Avenue , heading uptown toward Harlem , las tetas grandes drooping toward the ground . Sam and I shake hands . " Some day , " he says . " You and me , we 're gon na own this city , Hector . "  | " We will always be friends , " I say . We leave each other and I carry Carlos ' laundry over my shoulder , into my apartment . My grandmother says she will take care of it . She has food ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I go to my room and try to do homework , but I can think only of Carlos my friend , and of the party that can not be until he returns . I open the bundle of laundry on my bed , separating the socks from the underwear , the shirts from the handkerchiefs , and then I see it . My heart leaps ! I grab it and hold it in front of me , then turn it around . Thelettering is stamped in black : PROPERTY OF N.Y . STATE  --  Carlos has sent his strait-jacket home ! I stuff it under my shirt and run down the stairs , into the hot street , waving my hand to all I pass . " Carlos will return ! " I shout to the girls on the corner . " Carlos will return ! " I cross Columbus Avenue and race toward Sam 's house on Central Park West . In my mind I can see Carlos ' sulky face as he sees me discovering what he has done , and I know that he will sleep happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam is hysterical when I show the strait-jacket to him , and we tie each other into it and laugh and talk of the party we will have when Carlos returns . " We will show them something , Mr. President , " I say . " Oh , how we will show them something . " And then , with devil 's eyes , the president glances at the closet where the briefcases are hidden , and offers his vice-president a cigar  |p129IN  1951 when the first set of basketball scandals broke , Izzie and I were too young to be much interested . We were in the third grade then , at P.S. 92 in Brooklyn , and in those days basketball seemed far less important than lighting fires in alleys or knocking over the garbage cans that lined the sidewalks on our block . By the time we were in the seventh grade , though , basketballhad come to mean everything to us . Every afternoon and all day Saturday and Sunday we lived in the schoolyard , and on Friday nights Izzie 's father and mine would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High School . Sometimeswe 'd chip in to buy sports magazines , and we 'd cut out the full-page color photos of our heroes to scotch-tape on our walls . Once , at a Knick game at Madison Square Garden , betweenhalves , Izzie got Cousy to sign a color picture of himself from Sport magazine , and he mounted it on a piece of oaktag and pasted it to his wall , by his pillow . Izzie was really good then . Everybody thought for sure he 'd be an All-American when he grew up . He had everything  --  speed , drive , and the greatest shooting eye anybody in our neighborhood had ever seen . What he had that amazed everybodymost was a set-shot that he let go from his forehead with a little outward flick of his wrists . The way he held the ball just above his eyes you sometimes wondered how he saw the basket . But he did . And if you came up close to try to block his shot , he 'd zip right around you for an easy lay-up . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Izzie and I were excited . They came once a year and they put on a " clinic " for us  --  passing , dribbling , shooting , and going through patterns , while their coach , Mr. Goldstein , explained things to us , and we all sat on the floor , watching , and wishing that some day we 'd be out there on the court in the blue and gold Erasmus uniforms , coming back to our school with every one of the seventh and eighth graders wishingthey could be us . " I 'd like to use one of your boys for our next demonstration , " Mr. Goldstein said to our gym teacher when the clinic was almost over . Mr. Goldstein was a short man , paunchy , but he dressed like a man who could have spent every weekend at the Concord Hotel if he 'd wanted to . He was generally acknowledgedto be the best coach in the city , and according to the guys in the schoolyard , every college team in the country had approached him at one time or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turning out top-notch teams for more than twenty years . I knew he did n't have to worry much about money , because over the summers he was head counselor at Camp Wanatoo . " I hear you have a boy named Izzie Cohen who 's supposed to be pretty good , from what my players tell me , " Mr. Goldstein said to our gym teacher . " Is he here ? " I was sure Izzie 's heart was going to bounce out on the court , but he did n't seem flustered at all  --  he just stood up from where he was sitting beside me and walked straight overSomething Is Rotten in the Borough of Brooklyn 131to Mr. Brown , our gym teacher . He did n't seem nervous at all . When he stood next to them , though , for the first time in my life I think I realized how short he was . He was n't even as tall as Mr. Goldstein , and he seemed at least a foot and a half shorter than any of the Erasmus players . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're the little hot-shot I 've been hearing about . " He put his arm around Izzie 's shoulders . " Let 's see what you can do . John  --  throw Izzie here a ball  --  " Goldstein had called to Johnny Rudy , who was the best player Erasmus had that year , and Johnny threw Izzie the ball . " What 's your favorite shot ? " Goldstein asked . " Set , " Izzie said . " Good  --  you just relax and let 's see you take a few . When you feel loose  --  " Izzie nodded and dribbled toward the foul-circle . All the Erasmus players stopped shooting and they stood around mumbling to each other and laughing . Nothing seemed to bother Izzie , though  --  he just went to the top of the key , put the ball over his eyebrows , flicked his wrists , and swish ! the ball dropped through the basket . I do n't think our gym had ever heard a cheer like the one we let loose then . Izzie took the ball , picked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He made six in a row from over twenty-five feet out before he missed one , and we did n't stop cheering the whole time . For the rest of that year Izzie was the hero of our school . I 'd have given anything to have been him . We still went to the schoolyard together every afternoon and on weekends , but things were different now . Before , we used to have to wait our nexts on Saturdays and Sundays , because all the guys who played were much older than us  --  so that we only got to play about twice all day  --  now , though , Izzie was getting picked allp132the time . The guys would set up picks for him and he 'd bomb away , hardly ever missing . Once in a while  --  I guess because they felt sorry seeing me left out  --  I 'd get picked too . There was one guy who always used to pick the two of us to play with him when he came down . He was a big black guy  --  at least six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball player . His left eye crossed toward his right one a little and he had big pinkish lips that did n't seem to go right with his straight nose . When he played he was mean as the devil too , and he used to sort of snort when he dribbled . Nobody  --  but nobody  --  ever took a rebound away from him if he was planted under the boards , and when he started to drive , everybody backed out of the way or got run over . He 'd been all-everything in high school , I figured , and I was sure  --  if I was sure of anything  --  that if he 'd gone on to play pro ball he 'd have been better than both Sweetwater Clifton and Carl Braun rolled into one . He did n't come down too often  --  maybe once or twice every few months  --  and we used to wonder what he did the rest of the time . One day Izzie and I decided we 'd find out , and that was how we first learned about the basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Izzie turned to him and asked the question . For a second , the way he looked , I thought he was going to get angry . Everybody had stopped playing  --  right in the middle of a game  --  and they all stared at us . " Somethin ' the matter ? " " No , nothin ' , Mack  --  " " Then why 'd you stop  --  ? " They started again real quick . Mack leaned back against the wire fence where we were sitting . " I was in the scandals , " he said . " The what  --  ? " I asked  | " The scandals , man  --  the fixes . You know  --  shavin ' points , dumpin ' games  --  the whole works  --  " He sounded impatient and Izzie and I knew enough not to press him or say anything else . " Why I do n't play for some college ? " He laughed . " Because I got me a real good job now . I work at the Minit-Wash , soaping down cars , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yeah , me , I got the cleanest hands of any fixer around  --  " He looked at Izzie then . " You 're gon na be a good ballplayersome day , kid , " he said . " You just do n't let nobody sweet-talk you , that 's all . You dump , if you want  --  if you 're good enough to . Only be careful . That 's the main thing . Ai n't nothing wrong with it , far as I can see  --  just you got ta play it cool . Be cool , man , and you do all right . " Then Mack got up , draped his sweatshirt over his shoulder , and started to walk out of the schoolyard . He knew everybody was staring at him , but he did n't say anything . He just waved to Izzie and kept walking . He never came back . During the rest of the year , the guys talked more about Mack and the fixes , so that after a while I understood the whole thing better . But Izzie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like to hear any of the talk . Whenever anyone mentioned the fixes , Izzie would walk away . That summer , for the first time I could remember , Izzie and I were separated . My father knew how much I loved basketball , and he and my mother sent me to the camp where Mr. Goldstein was head counselor . Izzie 's parents could n't afford to send him along with me  --  his father worked as a tailor in a cleaning store  --  so he stayed home . I sent him a postcard about once a week , telling him how many points I was scoring in fullcourtgames and how I 'd talked with Johnny Rudy , who was a waiter at the camp , and how he 'd give me pointers , and how Ip134called Mr. Goldstein " Uncle Abe , " and things like that . When I got home at the end of August I did n't even wait to change my clothes . As soon as I 'd dropped my suitcase and my glove and ball in my bedroom , I raced out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the schoolyard  --  and there was Izzie , playing with a bunch of kids . It was great just watching him move around the court again , only something seemed different . He played from more of a crouch , even against kids shorter than himself , protecting the ball with his body , his back to the basket , and when he shot his set-shot now , it was from lower down  --  from the chin instead of the eyebrows . It did n't seem to affect his accuracy , though  --  he still swished the ball through . I walked into the yard , sat down , and waited . When the game was over and his team had won , he came over to me . I stood up , smiling . " Boy  --  you sure did grow ! " he said . They were his first words . " You must of grown six inches ! " " Five , according to the camp nurse , " I said . He hitched up his belt and looked away from me . " Well , pick two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foot taller than Izzie now and I could tell it bothered him . He did n't ask me anything about camp . He just concentrated on getting the game going . During that first time we played against each other , I did n't know what to do . Izzie was guarding me and I knew that if I took him into the pivot I could score lay-ups all day long . But I did n't want him to think I was taking it easy " Watch my new corner jump-shot , " I called when the ball came to me . I dribbled away from the basket , Izzie next to me . " Goldstein taught it to me . " I did n't even hit the rim the first time I shot . Izzie 's team got the rebound , passed it around , and Izzie started to take a set-shot . I was up on him right away and I smashed it . The nextp135time I got the ball I hit a jump-shot from near the corner . I did n't try to block any more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he could n't seem to hit for beans after I 'd stuffed him that first time . He was pretty quiet when we 'd finished playing , but I just kept talking about everything I 'd done all summer , and when I switched the subject to college and pro teams he began to loosen up a bit and pretty soon it was like old times , comparingballplayers and predicting which teams were going to do what that year , and imitating the moves of our favorite players . I went back to Camp Wanatoo the next summer and Izzie stayed in the city again . At the end of July his father died of cancer . Everybody knew it was going to happen and when Izzie wrote me about it he did n't seem too upset  --  mostly he sounded annoyed about the religious stuff that had accompaniedthe funeral . He said the rabbi had made a cut in the collar of his good black suit with a razor blade . When we both entered Erasmus that September as freshmen , I was six one and Izzie was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two . He never grew after that either . Maybe an inch . He changed a lot too . We still saw each other every day and we had no trouble talking about sports and school , but he did n't come down to the schoolyard as much . He spent more time at home , taking care of his kid sister while his mother was away working . I 'd stop by his house sometimes on my way home from the schoolyard for supper , and he 'd be sitting on the couch , with his sister next to him , leaning on his shoulder . Her name was Miriam , and even though she was a year or so younger than we were , she was already bigger than Izzie . She wore a lot of Izzie 's clothes  --  his shirts and his old baseball hats  --  and she reminded me of those refugee kids you saw inp136all the movies that came out after the war . I used to picture myself riding on the front of a Patton tank through a European village , with her looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mouth , while I 'd reach into my pocket for a Hershey bar to give her . Izzie would read stories to her , and I 'd stay with them for a while , drinking a Coke Izzie gave me , and listen also . Miriam hardly ever smiled , except when he read poems to her that he 'd written himself . Then she 'd giggle and snuggle up to him . Their mother worked as a saleswoman at A &; S 's in downtownBrooklyn , near the Loew 's Metropolitan and the Fox , and I 'd sit in the kitchen with Izzie , talking about what the games had been like that afternoon  --  who was improving and which guys were going to try out for the Erasmus team that year and things like that  --  while he started getting supper ready for the three of them . His poems were pretty good , I thought  --  they had a lot of strange words in them that he 'd invented himself  --  and when we were sophomores he had some published in the school literarymagazine , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much about basketball and spent most of his time working on his poems and being with his sister . I played on the school team and he did n't , but we were still close friends . Not as close as we 'd been , but pretty close , and even though I began spending most of my time after that with guys from the school team , I think I still thought of Izzie as my best friend . We 'd meet each other at the corner every morning at 8:15 to walk to school together , and I was becoming too busy with practice sessions and games and dating girls to realize that I hardly ever stopped by his house any more and that he never came by mine to see me . Once in a while he 'd come down to the schoolyard on a Sunday morning  --  he 'd always have The New York Times tucked under his arm  --  andp137he 'd get in a game or two of basketball , but he never stayed long . We drifted apart during the last two years of high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't go out with girls too much , and most people I knew at school , especially the guys on the team , thought he was weird . He 'd do crazy things  --  like mimeographing his own poems and handing them out in the cafeteria during lunch period  --  and even though I always defended him when people said how screwy he was becoming , by the time we were seniors I had to agree with them , though I never said so . He was editor-in-chief of The Erasmian by then , and he had his own set of friends and hung out in Greenwich Village with them . He dressed strangely , too . He was never sloppy , but he 'd wear crazy combinations  --  a bright-red polka-dot bow tie with a blue flannel shirt , or a vest over a T-shirt  --  things like that . When the yearbook ran the popularity contests that year  --  most likely to succeed , best-looking , class athlete  --  he ran for Joe Erasmus . He had big glossy pictures made of himself dressed in nothing but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cigar in his mouth . He was staring at a skull he held in his right hand and under the picture he 'd printed : YORICK SAYS-VOTE FOR IZZIE COHEN . The second set of basketball scandals broke during our senior year of high school , near the end of the basketball season . By then I 'd grown to about six four and was a starter on the Erasmus team . Mr. Goldstein had had a heart attack the previous spring , so he was n't the coach any more . Instead , we had a young guy who 'd been a big star at Erasmus and C.C.N.Y.  --  Al Newman . He was a good coach , but no Goldstein , and we were fighting just to get into the city playoffs . Mr. Goldstein had been made head of the Physical Education De/partment , but everybody knew that that did n't take much work . He 'd sit in his office all day and talk with anyone who came by . He still came to practices and games , and he said he 'd be back coaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me at camp that the doctor would never allow it . " I 'm happy where he is now , " she said . " And I 'm grateful he has something to do with his days . You know he could stay home and live well  --  we have enough saved , Howie  --  and there 's always the teachers ' retirement plan waiting . But he would n't be happy away from Erasmus . It 's part of him . " I knew that what she said was true . Even the money part . Aside from the camp job , there was a stock-brokers firm on Flatbush Avenue , about a block away from school , and Mr. Goldstein would spend his lunch hour there with some other teachers . He 'd bought a brand-new Dodge after the summer , and he was still the sharpest dresser around . A few days after two big stars from N.Y.U. and Columbiaconfessed to fixing games , Izzie telephoned me . He told me he had big news about the latest basketball scandal and that if I came to his house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded mysterious about it all , and I told him I 'd be there in a few minutes . We sat in his bedroom and he offered me a cigar . I told him the basketball season was still on , so I was n't smoking . He shrugged , leaned back in his swivel chair and inhaled . It was probably a year since I 'd last been in his room , I realized . The room seemed smaller than it had a few years before , and it was cluttered  --  books and magazines stacked everywhere . On the walls he had pasted postcards of famous paintings you get from museums , and over his desk he 'd painted a big hammerand sickle in red , white , and blue . There were shelves built into all the walls now , and half hidden by one over his bed , with clothes hanging over the edge across one side of it , I couldp139see the picture of Bob Cousy . The edges were cracked and had been mended with scotch tape . " What 's the scoop ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , Howie , " he began . He sipped from a glass . " Care for a drink ? " I shook my head . He leaned forward then and , even though we were just a few feet apart , he spoke in a whisper . " I have discovered , it seems , the newest of the basketball fixes . " He paused and closed his eyes knowingly . " Your revered Mr. Goldstein  --  Uncle Abe , ' I believe you used to call him  --  is deeply implicated in them , I fear . " I stood up . " What  --  ? " He smiled up at me . " Oh , come off it , huh , Izzie , " I said . " He does n't coach college  --  he does n't even coach high school any more . And even if he did  --  " " But Mr. Goldstein has quite an interest in the stock market , does n't he ? And you and I , Howie , we know what teachers ' salaries are like . . " Sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 's head counselor at Wanatoo  --  " " Ah yes , yes , " he said . " All right . So add another thousand dollars . Two thousand dollars for the position of head counselorat Camp Wanatoo . Let 's even add a bit more for the bonus he gets for each camper he signs up . Could all that account for his new car ? His trip to Miami every Christmas ? His own home on Bedford Avenue ? " He knocked some ash from the end of his cigar onto the floor . " And have you ever noticed the coat that Mrs. Goldstein wears at our school 's basketball games ? I 've been told that on chilly evenings during the summershe could be seen wearing her mink to the canteen of Camp Wanatoo . A marvelous image , I might note : mink at a canteen in a Catskill camp . I should use it . It 's difficult to believe , Howie , I know , but our beloved coach  --  " " Look , Izzie , " I said , walking to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You better sober up and I 'll talk to you on the way to school one day this week , okay ? Or  --  " " I will assuage your fears , Howard , " Izzie said , rising and coming to me , his hand on my arm . " Mr. Goldstein has never conspired to prearrange the scores of high school basketball games  --  his dealings are far more nefarious . " He returned to his desk and pulled a manila envelope from a drawer . He started to hand it to me and just as I reached for it he pulled it back . " I have in this envelope proof of the  --  what shall we call it ?  --  the finagling Mr. Goldstein has been engaged in . In my wildest imagination I could never have invented anything more absurd  --  or more tragic for those of us who look to our teachers , to our boyhood heroes , for guidance , for example , for  --  " " Come on , " I said . " What 's in the envelope  --  ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them rather ludicrous , " he continued , sitting down again . " And it goes without saying that I do not at all condemn any of the players who have fixed games . For that philosophy I am still indebted to our one-time friend , Mack  --  if you remember him . " " I remember . " " This time I thought to myself : Izzie , I said , there is something cockeyed in all this fixing business  --  all this moralizingfrom teachers and rabbis and newspapers . Rigged quiz shows , point-shaving , payola  --  what 's the big deal , eh ? " I sat down on the edge of his bed , leaned back , and listened as he talked on and on . I 'd never felt so far away from him . The picture of Cousy was behind me and I wondered if Izzie had seen me glance at it . It was hard to remember any of the conversations we 'd had when we 'd been in grade school together , and it was harder to realize that the guy who was sittingacross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd spent almost my whole life knowing . What I could n't understand , I suppose , was how any guy who 'd loved sports so muchP141could have turned out this way . All of us  --  Corky , Louie , Eddie , Marty , Kenny , Stan  --  we 'd all had our different ways , our own strange ideas once in a while . If I 'd wanted to think about it , I guess I could have found something weird in everybody'shome , including my own  --  you could never know everything that went on inside somebody 's house , behind his doors when you were n't there . Still , if Corky had lived through all the stuff with his brother and his old man , and if Eddie could keep going , not having been able to play ball .. . I shrugged , but Izzie did n't seem to notice . " I thought to myself , " he was saying . " Izzie , I said , there must be some analogue , some microcosm in our own small Brooklyn  --  Jewish  --  Flatbush-Erasmus-world that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I said to myself : what honest good man in Erasmus could be tempted by the Almighty Dollar ? Who could be our own Topaze ? The answer came at once  --  Abraham Goldstein . In my mind 's eyes I saw it all : the parallel to the national scandals . " He spread his hand outward in an arc , as if the words he spoke were hanging in front of him . " Famous coach receives bribes from local Sporting Goods Store in return for letting them sell Erasmus boys and girls their gym suits  --  " " What  --  ? " I got up , then sat down again and started to laugh . I should n't take him so seriously , I thought to myself . " Yes , it 's funny , is n't it , Howie ? Goldstein grows rich while Levy 's Sporting Goods Store gets sole rights to sell us Tshirts , gym shorts , and jockstraps . Most men who are possessed by visions  --  Blake and Coleridge come to mind at once  --  rarely see them manifested in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Levy 's has been supplying five thousand boy and girls with their gym apparel , Mr. Goldstein has been getting what is known along Flatbush Avenue as a good old-fashioned kick-back. "  |p142He  leaned back , somewhat breathless , obviously pleased with himself . " If you 're lying , " I said , " I swear to God I 'll ram my fist straight through your face . " " Tomorrow New York City shall know the truth , " Izzie went on . " My campaign will begin . " He took a sheet of paper from his envelope and handed it to me . It was handwritten in capital letters : WHILE MR . GOLDSTEIN GROWS RICH WE WEARLEVY 'S JOCKSTRAPS . HAS ANYONE COMPARED PRICES ? ? ? WHAT IS BEHIND THE LATEST EVENT INTHE GROWING SERIES OF ATHLETIC FIXES ? ? ? It was signed , " The Shadow . " " You 're out of it , " I said , throwing the paper back at him . " I swear to God you are  --  " " Ah , but like another famous madman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomorrow five hundred mimeographed copies of the sheet you have just seen will appear mysteriously in the classrooms and corridors of our school  --  " I did n't bother arguing with him . I just told him again that I thought he was nuts , and I left . On the staircase going out of his house , I met his sister . She smiled at me the way she always did when I saw her in the halls at Erasmus  --  not able to keep her eyes straight on me  --  and I felt uncomfortable this time . Her arms were full of packages from the store and I fumbleda little , offering to take them upstairs for her , but she would n't let me and I was just as glad . She said something about my not coming by their house for a long time and I nodded . She was leaning back against the banister and I was a step below her . I could tell she wanted to talk with me , but I did n't have anything to say . She asked me about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doing on the basketballp143team , and I nodded again . Her hair was long  --  kind of dark brown  --  and it was n't combed too well . She shuffled her packagesinto the crook of one of her arms and brushed it back . " How 's Izzie ? " she asked . I shrugged , " Okay , I guess . " She nodded . " It 'd be good if you could come by more often , but  --  " She stopped , then sighed . " Do n't mind me , Howie , " she said . " I do n't know sometimes  --  you know what I mean ? " I felt a little dizzy . There was something in her face , the way she stood  --  kind of relaxed , yet unsure of herself  --  that made her seem younger and older at the same time . " Well , " she said when I did n't answer  --  a kind of weak smile under her red cheeks . " I guess we ca n't hold these packages all day , huh ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the store  --  " I asked her if she worked there too now  --  at A &; S 's  --  and she said yes , and then I said I 'd see her at school sometime and I ducked down the stairs . The next day Izzie 's notices were all around the school and lots of guys came to me and asked about them , figuring that only Izzie would pull a stunt like that . I played dumb . When Mrs. Goldstein telephoned me that night and asked about the notices , I told her I could n't figure out what they meant . Two days later Izzie had mimeographed up a new batch of sheets . On these he 'd placed two lists : on the left-hand side were the prices Erasmus students paid for their gym uniforms , and on the right-hand side were the prices Davega charged for the same things . In almost every case , the Davega prices were lower . Mr. Goldstein did n't show up for school the next day , but Izzie 's notices did . This time he 'd printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , his car , Mrs. Gold/stein 's mink coat , the trips to Miami , etc.  --  with the estimatedcost of each . Then he 'd listed Mr. Goldstein 's salaries from school and camp . Across the bottom of the sheet he 'd printed : " Something is rotten in the borough of Brooklyn . " Two days passed and there were no more messages from " The Shadow . " The weekend came and we won an importantgame against Madison , insuring us of a spot in the playoffs . I hoped Izzie would have stopped his campaign by the time we got back to school Monday , but he had n't . This time he 'd printed leaflets which seemed to prove that SearsRoebuckhad sent a color television set to Mr. Goldstein 's house and had sent the bill to Levy 's Sporting Goods Store . At the bottom of this sheet was a quotation from Edmund Burke : " All that is necessary for the forces of evil to win in the world is for enough good men to do nothing . " The New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening edition that day  --  I figured Izzie must have mailed them the material  --  and on Tuesday night Mrs. Goldstein called me again . She pleaded with me to do something . I called Izzie right after she hung up , and he was obviously excited by the fact that Mrs. Goldstein had been telephoning me . There was no talking with him , though . When I mentioned Mr. Goldstein 's bad heart , he only carried on more than ever . " Our names are all written in the Book of Life , Howard . I am not moved by your plea for pity . . . " I hung up on him . A day or two later , our coach told us that Mr. Goldstein was going to send in a letter of resignation to the Board of Education . The guys all looked at me when he said it , as if it were my responsibility to do something , but I just shrugged and ignored them . Izzie had n't been seen in school for the previous two days . I went home for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after nine I found myself knocking at Mr. Goldstein 's door . I do n't know what I would have said to him ifp145he 'd been there , but he was n't . Some neighbors saw me and told me that he 'd been taken to the hospital a few hours before . If Izzie had been there right then , I think I might have killed him . I headed straight for his house . By the time I reached it , though , I 'd calmed down and decided to call the hospital to see how Mr. Goldstein was . " Greetings , greetings , my basketball-hero comrade . " It was Izzie . He was leaning against a lamppost , in the shadows , puffing on a cigar . His beret was tilted to one side , so that it nearly covered his right eye . " How long have you been watching me ? " I asked . " Forever , forever , Howie  --  since we were boys together , since we came in trailing those wings of glory . . . or were they clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said it matter-of-factly . Izzie nodded , as if he knew already . " Cowards  --  cowards die many times before their  --  " " Oh , shut your trap already , huh ? Just can it ! " I took a step toward him and drew back my fist . " Come , come , " he said calmly . " Get it over with . Hit me . Use your physical power . What else do you have , after all ? " " Forget it , " I said , shoving my hands in my pockets . " There 's no use talking with you  --  " " Have you seen our friends down the street ? " Izzie asked . I turned and looked . It was dark and I could n't make out much . At the end of the block , though , I could see the shapes of a group of guys . " I await them in the light of the lamppost . They called a while ago and told me they were coming to getme ... I saw them coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I could make out faces . " Are you totally nuts ? " I said . " Get inside your damned house . Those guys ' 11 beat shit out of you . "   " If that will satisfy their animal desires , then perhaps  --  " " Do n't be an ass  --  get inside , Izzie . They 'll kill you ! " He did n't move . I whirled around . The guys were almost to us now  --  some of them were on the basketball team with me , and the rest were jocks from the football team . I looked back at Izzie . His eyes were n't shifting . Instead , he had this weird smile on his face , and he just kept puffing away on his cigar , blowing smoke rings . " You 're the first one here , " Hank Ebel said to me . " That means you got rights to go at him first , Howie . " " Ah , lay off , huh ? " I said . " You 'll just get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need no defenders ! " Izzie shouted . His voice was strong . " Let them have their way with me . We are in the arena , Howie ! " " You 're not gon na take up for him , are ya , Howie ? " Stan Reiss asked . I looked at the others  --  Harvey Rosen , Jerry Charyn , Vic Fontani . " No , " I said . " No  --  but I 'm not  --  I 'm not gon na let you guys get yourselves in trouble . Just leave him be . " " Bullshit . " One of the guys made a move toward Izzie and I backed up , spreading my arms out to protect him . He screamed . " Let me alone , Howie  --  I can fight my own battles . Let me alone ! Let these boors tear me apart for telling them the truth . Let me alone . Let me alone ... " One of the football players grabbed at me to shove me aside , but I did n't move . " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothin ' against you  --  but if you do n't let us get him , we 're gon na have to get you too . " " Okay , " I said . I meant it  --  but I knew already that it did n't matter . I was n't going to be able to help Izzie . Still , IP147stood my ground , more tired than defiant . Somebody grabbed at my shoulder and I shook him off . Someone came at me from the other side and I swung . Then they were on me . They did n't hit me much . Just grabbed me by the legs and arms . I fought and swung but there were too many of them . They dragged me away and a few of them sat on me while the rest took care of Izzie . It did n't take them long . I heard him laughing , shouting something  --  poetry , I guess  --  and then I heard him scream . He really howled ! You could hear windows sliding open in all the apartment houses on the block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they took off down the street . Izzie was lying next to the lamppost . His lips were moving , producing a strange sound  --  I could n't tell if it was whimpering or laughing . I got him under one arm and helped him into his building and up the stairs . When we got into the apartment and his mother saw him , she nearly fainted . I told her to call a doctor , but she was too paralyzed to do anything . Miriam came out of her room then , and while she got Izzie to a couch in the living room , I telephoned . Izzie 'd been pretty well mashed up around his face  --  and his left arm hung limply . While I held a compress on his eye , Miriam coaxed her mother into the bedroom and got her to lie down . Then she came back in . I looked at her , shrugging to indicate that I was sorry  --  hopingshe 'd know I did n't have any part of it . " When it snows it pours , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is what I want to know . You ever see anything like us ? " She seemed in command and I just did what she told me to , getting Mercurochromeand Band-Aids from the bathroom . She had a ballpointpen stuck in her hair right over her ear , and her sweater was loose . " I 'm glad we were n't working tonight , is all . I just do n't know sometimes , Howie , you know what I mean ? " Izzie blinked and smiled at us . " You jerk , " Miriam saidp148to him , and he smiled bigger . She talked to me like my own sister . " Like , where 's it all gon na end , Howie ? " I shrugged again , and she seemed to take this for a good enough response . Her mother started crying from the other room , chanting in Yiddish about Izzie and Izzie 's father . " See what I mean ? " Miriam said , and she left me . It was crazy , in the middle of everything , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been fastened right on her chest , as if I 'd noticed for the first time what an enormous pair of knockers she had . " Well , well , Howie my friend , " Izzie began . His voice cracked . " I  --  I suppose I can not say Et tu , Brute  --  " In the other room I could hear Miriam . " Shush , shush  --  you worked hard today , Momma  --  you take it easy . It 's okay , Momma . I 'll take care of everything . It 's okay . . . " I kept thinking that Izzie 's mother was really his grandmother . His bottom lip was already swollen to twice its size and both his eyes were starting to close . I got more ice from the kitchen . When I came back , the door to Mrs. Cohen 's room was closed and Miriam was washing up some blood from the couch . She shook her head , and drew in deeply on a cigarette . I kept my eyes off her chest . " There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howie ? I mean  --  " The doctor came in a little while and I was glad . He examinedall of Izzie 's cuts and swellings , put his arm in a sling , and told him to come to the office the next day for X-rays . When he left , Izzie and I went into his room togetherand Miriam left us alone . The whole time the doctor had been there , Izzie had seemed cocky . As soon as he got into his room , though , he collapsed , just sort of folding and dropping to the floor . I lifted him to his chair and he opened his eyes halfway . He was shivering and I threw a blanket over his shoulders . " Should I call the doctor again ? " I asked . " Or get Miriam ? " P149He shook his head from side to side . He seemed totally sober now and he gave me a long look , as if he were trying to tell me he could n't figure out why it had turned out this way either . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers , and then I left . " You try to sleep , " I said . " Maybe I 'll stop by in a few days . " Mr. Goldstein was on critical for a week , and then he began to improve . He did n't come back to school , though . I got a Graduation card from him that June . Izzie returned to classes about a week and a half later and , to my surprise , nobody paid much attention to him . We were all too busy worrying about the playoffs and which colleges we would be going to  --  events passed pretty quickly in those days . Izzie got a state scholarshipand was supposed to go to Columbia the next fall , but when I was home for Thanksgiving during my first year at collegemy mother told me that he 'd dropped out of school and was living at home . The next time I saw him was at the end of my first year of college . I 'd driven home with some guys who were on the freshman team with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show them around . I 'd improved during my first year of college and I did n't have much trouble with the Erasmusplayers . There were some other guys at the schoolyard who played college ball , and I could hold my own with them too . I 'd developed a good outside shot and it surprised a lot of the guys who 'd known me at Erasmus . My friends and I played a few games and then we started to leave . " Hey , Howie  --  you see your friend Izzie lately ? " one of the Erasmus players asked . " No . " " There he is . Did n't you notice ? He 's a real star now . " The guy laughed and I looked where he 'd pointed . Onp150the other side of the wire fence , at the far end of the playground , I could see a bunch of grade-school kids playing basketball . I had to squint at first . Then I recognized him . He was playing with a group of little kids . Some of them were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " One thing you got ta admit  --  he 's got the best set-shot of all of ' em ! " Everybody laughed.  |p151THE  CHILD had not been wanted . He said they could n't afford it yet ; she said they had n't done all the things they had planned to do . They thought , during the second month , of giving up the child , but decided against it . They agreed that she would continue to teach until the seventh month , and they told each other that they would love the child anyway , that somehow things would work out . As the months went by and the child began to grow inside her , Helen changed ; not only did she begin to forget about the many things they had hoped to do while still not " burdened " with children , but she found that she was beginning to look forward to becoming a mother . " Maybe it was best this way , honey , " Gary would say at night when they lay in bed together . " Maybe we were only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years slip by , inventing excuses , if this had n't happened to us . " After spending an evening with their friends they would take pleasure , almost secretly , it seemed , from comparing themselves to those married couples who were still without children , from noting how the child was drawing them closer to one another . P152She wrote to her family and to his , and they received long letters of congratulations and sizable checks from both sets of parents . They were amazed , they told each other , at how easily they could accept the gifts , without feelings of guilt , of obligation . Helen delighted in her third-grade children as she had never done before , and he became more optimistic about their financial situation . Several times a week he would sit down on the living-room couch with her and he would go over the figures  --  showingher , with pencil and paper , that even if she did n't return to teaching for three years , everything would be all right . She praised him for his ability to arrange things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What pleased them most , though , was feeling the baby , listening to it . He would lie with his ear pressed gently to her stomach , and every time he heard a sound they would experience a thrill which seemed magical . " I think I 'm falling in love with you all over again , " she said to him . " It 's so strange . " She had never seemed more beautiful to him , and he had never loved her more . They had never , he felt , been this close . Still , as the months went by , he became increasingly uneasy . In particular , he was afraid of what would happen to her were something to go wrong . He called her doctor and the doctor told him not to worry . He did , anyway . Helen did n't , he saw , and this worried him even more . While she was making supper one evening he leafed through a copy of Life magazine and found an article about Thalidomide babies who were being rehabilitatedthrough the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If , as he hoped , she had not seen it , what was he to do ? If he threw the magazine away without telling her , and if she found out , she would think that he was treating her like a child , overprotecting her . " Have you finished with all the magazinesin the rack ? " he called to her . " It 's getting stuffed . " " I 'm finished with them , " she called back.  |p153At  the office , his friends told him that she would begin feeling ugly and neglected , that her eyes would turn inward , that she would begin neglecting him  --  he waited , but none of these things happened . Still , he was afraid for her , for the baby . He went to see their doctor , and the doctor smiled at his fears . Gary considered , and then told the doctor about the time , before they were married , when Helen had been ill . The doctor nodded ; Helen had told him all about it . There was nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy child would , he said , serve to close the door even more securely on that period of her life . What if the child was n't healthy , he asked . The doctor replied that something could always go wrong , of course  --  there were never guarantees ; as things stood , though , Helen was coming along beautifully and he did n't see any cause for worry : there was more chance of a safe falling on Gary while he walked in the street , he laughed , than of something being wrong with the child . Without telling Helen , Gary telephoned her mother and urged her to come and stay with them , but Helen 's mother said that she was n't needed yet . She thought she would come to New York after the baby was born , when she could be more helpful . Gary said all right . When it came time to give up their own pleasures , he became wary again , he waited for something to happen , but she neither neglected him nor felt neglected ; if anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at night her only concern was that he might go to sleep unsatisfied . One evening he tested her by opening the middle drawer of the living-room secretary and taking out the European travel folders they had collected . She smiled . " We 'll go some day , " he said . " You 'll see . " " We 'll go some day , " she agreed , her hand touching his cheek . The radiance in her own cheeks disturbed him . On weekends they saw their friends , and when he wouldp154mention her " strangeness , " nobody seemed to understand him . Everybody said that she was beautiful in pregnancy and would make a beautiful mother . His friends teased him about being " put off , " and afterwards she would console him , more soft , more kind than ever . Then he seized on something definitely amiss : she had not sensed his worry . There it was , he told himself . She was too placid , too understanding , much too free of all anxiety . He telephoned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to have no worries whatsoever and not to sense the fact that he was worried ? The doctor laughed . " Do me a favor , Gary , " he said . " Tell her what you 've told me and see what happens . " He did . " Oh , you 're sweet , " she said , cuddling to him in bed . " Of course I know you 've been worried . You 've been so dear  --  " " You knew ? " " Of course . " She laughed again . " Everybody knows . You 're not very good at hiding things . But do n't be glum , dear one . I like you this way . Somebody has to do the worrying for the three of us . " Three weeks before she was due , she told him that she had invited Mrs. Hart to have dinner with them . Mrs. Hart had been their landlady before they were married . " Wo n't she be surprised ! " she exclaimed . He did n't answer . She snuggled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kick out of seeing us together  --  you know , as a married couple . Remember the way she used to wink at me whenever she 'd see us going in and out of your apartment ? " He remembered . They had not seen Mrs. Hart for over two years . She giggled : " I liked living in sin with you . Do you know that ? " He tried to smile . " You do n't mind if she comes , do you ? When I told her I was Mrs. Fogel , she said , Gary 's mother ? ' Then I said , No , I 'm Helen Fogel , Mrs. Hart , '  |p155and  she congratulated me and said that she 'd seen the announcementin the Times . Do you mind if she comes ? " He said he did n't mind ; he could n't help but feel , though , that something stupid  --  something terrible  --  would happen if Mrs. Hart came . He thought , he waited . Then the day before Mrs. Hart was supposed to come , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing was Helen and the baby , he told himself . He had been foolish to wait this long . The doctor did n't see anything particularly wrong , or antic , in what Helen was doing , but he suggested that Gary see a psychiatristif Gary thought that would help . " I 'll go , " Gary said . The psychiatrist listened to Gary and agreed with him that it was natural for an expectant father to worry , but he did n't seem to find anything fearful in what had happened . Still , until the baby was born , Gary could come for sessions twice a week if he liked . Gary felt uncomfortable , silly , and said that he supposedhe was just a typical nervous father-to-be ; he left before the time was up . That night Helen told him that she had telephoned Mrs. Hart and canceled the dinner arrangements . " It would have made you uncomfortable , would n't it ? " she said . " Anyway , it was a silly idea in the first place . " Two and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she went to the hospital . She called him at his office , and by thetime he arrived she was in the delivery room . When he wasallowed into her room afterward , she was sleepy , but happierthan ever . " I saw the whole thing , " she said . " It was beautiful . " She came home from the hospital three days later , andher mother flew in from Cleveland and stayed with them fortwo weeks . The girl had weighed seven pounds four ounces atbirth , and everyone agreed that she looked just like Helen . Gary 's parents drove in from Boston , stayed for a week , andthen left . As the doctor had predicted , his anxiety was gone asp156suddenly as it had come . The two of them spent endless , timelesshours watching their child ; the hands and feet  --  the fingernails , the soft wrinkles at the knuckles , the lines across the palm , under the toes  --  they fascinated him most : so delicate , so perfect , so miniature . Proudly , he told all their friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do was lift it and she would stop . Once in a while , out of habit , he supposed , he would find himself observing Helen , noting her behavior , but she gave him no cause for worry now , and he was pleased . He had been a bit concerned at first that she had experienced no pain whatever during labor , but the doctor assured him that her experience was not abnormal . " It happens , " he said . At night they took the baby into their bed with them and watched her , talked to her . Then they would return her to the crib and talk for hours about how glad they were that they had not given her up . " I 've never loved you so much , " he said . " Soon , " she said . " Soon . " He studied their finances , showed her the results of his calculations , and they agreed that they would have to be careful . They checked with their doctor after the first month and then put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil days " circled in red . Two days later the baby broke out in a rash that covered her arms and neck . They went to the doctor , and he told them not to be alarmed . He prescribed a skin cream and said that the rash would probably disappear in a week or less . " It 's summer , though , " he said , " and the heat will tend to aggravate it . But do n't worry . It 's nothing . " They asked him the other question , and he smiled and said that it was all right . Had n't he told them so the other day ? They went home , happy , relieved . The baby started crying in the car , stopped , then started again when they were in the apartment . " Poor little thing , " Helen said as she smoothed the cream onto her daughter . Gary watched and felt helpless . The baby stopped , then startedP157again a half hour later . They stayed in the bedroom , and he held her . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cry . " There 's nothing to worry about , " she said . " You heard the doctor . " " But the rash is worse than before , " he said . " It 's spreadingto her chest . " " There 's nothing to worry about , " she repeated . " Come to bed . " He rocked the baby gently against his shoulder , and she howled even more . " Come to bed , " Helen said , undressing . He put the baby in its crib , and she cried in a way that terrified him ; she seemed to be gagging . " Please look at her , " he said . Helen got up , trailing her underclothes , letting them drop to the floor ; she looked at the baby and the baby stopped crying . " See ? " she said , touching his arm with her forefinger . " Now come to bed . " He went with her . " I 'm so tired , " he said when she 'd put the light out . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all right in a few days , and then he kissed her and told her to get a good night 's sleep . " I hope the baby sleeps until morning , " he said , but just as he spoke the baby started crying again . He turned on the night lamp and got out of bed . There were large red splotches on her face . " Should n't we call the doctor ? " he asked . " Come to bed , " she said . The baby kept crying . He held his child for a while and tried to soothe her by rubbing more salve on the red spots . The baby 's skin seemed red-hot to him . Gradually , the crying stopped . When he put her back in the crib , she whimpered . A quarter of an hour later he asked Helen to get up . " Guess we 'd better get the new safety valve out , " he said , noddingtoward the calendar . " You never know . " She clung to him , her arms locked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for you ? " he asked . She moaned . " Do you ? " he asked again . When she did n't answer , he stroked her hair and said that he would get it for her . But she would n't let him go . " Please , " he said . " We have to , honey . I do n't want to , either , but we havep158to . " " No , " she said , clutching him . " No . " " But it 's an evil day , " he said , laughing . " I do n't care , " she said fiercely . Their child began wailing again , and he tried , gently this time , to get away from Helen so that he could tend to the child . She was choking on something now , wailing , sputtering . " I do n't care , " Helen said again . The baby 's screaming stopped for a while . When it started the next time  --  louder , more painful than before  --  he tried to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do nothing but agree with what she repeated endlessly in his ear , that there was nothing to worry about.  |p159ONCE  , I remember , Izzie tried to get up a petition for us to sign , saying that unless Hebrew school was changed to two afternoons a week instead of three , we would all get our parents to switch to another synagogue . But Mrs. Bluestone caught him with it before he 'd gotten half a dozen signatures on it and by the time the rabbi got through with Izzie he was n't in a mood to pass around any more petitions . He did n't hate Hebrew school any less . None of us did  --  in fact , if anybody had taken a vote in those days on what we hated most in the world , Hebrew school would have won easily .

" Louie would be lookout and when he 'd see one of the teachers or the rabbi coming , he 'd yell " Chickee ! " and we 'd break ranks and be sitting on the steps , making believe we 'd been studying all along . Usually , if the rabbi came , he 'd lecture us about " desecratingthe Temple of God " with what he called our " vulgarities . " I could never look into his eyes when he spoke  --  and the same went for most of the guys . He was a little man , short and stocky  --  not much bigger than we were then  --  but he had a way of looking at you that made you certain God was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have come to the House of God dressed like an iceman ! " he said to me once , and I never came to Hebrew school without a tie again . Probably the worst thing about Hebrew school was in the winter when it would be dark out by the time we left and these tough guys would be waiting across Bedford Avenue in the doorway to the Flatbush Boys Club or Al Roon 's Health Club  --  they 'd make fun of us for having to go to school so much . And then , when we 'd hide our Hebrew books under our coats , the girls would walk next to us for protection  --  or they 'd get the Negro janitor to come out from the synagogue and chase the guys from across the street . There was nothing we hated more than having anybody think we needed protection . It made the tough guys tease us even more about being sissy Jews , and then we could do only one of three things : feel bad , punch the girls around and throw their books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cursing them the way they cursed us , calling them dirty Micks or Wops , and telling them they were n't such " rocks , " that they talked so big because they were scared to fight . A few times they chased us down Bedford Avenue , and a few times everybody kept daring and double-daring everybody else until we had a real fight . But the fights never lasted long  --  P161most of the time a grown-up from the Boys Club or the synagogue would break it up  --  and the worst anybody ever got was a bloody nose or a good shiner . Then , for a few weeks after , we 'd all tell each other how tough we 'd been or how many punches we 'd connected on , and we 'd get pretty brave in answering the Boys Club guys back . Izzie had a whole repertoire of lines about nuns and brothers and what dogs did to " rocks , " and we 'd stand around the steps of the synagogue cheering him on as he shouted them across the street . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd say , " If you 're so strong , let 's see you pick that up  --  " and then he 'd rear back and let fly with a tremendous gob of spit , which , when he caught the wind right , would usually land three-quarters of the way across Bedford Avenue . Izzie could spit farther than any guy I 've ever met . About the only time all year when anybody looked forward to Hebrew school were the few weeks in the spring when we got ready for Field Day . We 'd get to the Hebrew school at about 3:30 but we 'd only spend a half hour , maybe less , in the classroom and then Mr. Gleicher would take all of us over to the Parade Grounds for practice . Field Day was supposed to be the celebration for Lag B'Omer , a Jewish holiday , and all the Hebrew schools in Brooklyn got together for it at George WingateField . There were a lot of speeches by rabbis and politicians , and some Hebrew music and pageants and dances that the girls would put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track meet . Every Hebrew school in Brooklyn sent a team , and ours had come in first more than any of them . It was the only thing about the school that any of us were proud of . Our synagogue was called Congregation Shaare Torah , and it was pretty poor . It only had two floors : an upstairs templethat was nice enough , and a downstairs part that they called the " vestry rooms . " They were very dingy  --  in fact , theyp162were n't rooms at all . Just a basement with a bunch of sliding doors . They used this basement for everything  --  classrooms , offices , the rabbi 's study , the Junior Congregation Services on Saturday , dances , meetings , High Holy Day services , Sunday afternoon clubs , and even Bar Mizvahs and weddings . They were always announcing fund-raising campaigns to build a new center  --  but during the years we went there they never did , so that we used to be envious of the guys who went to other synagogues where they had basketball courts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole place for us  --  aside from the fun we had stealing kids ' books and passing them to the back row and under the sliding walls into the next classroom  --  was the trophy case outside the rabbi 's study . There were silver and gold cups in it , inscribed , and medals , and photographs of winning track teams with the guys laughing and hanging their arms over each other 's shoulders . We spent a lot of time gazing into that trophy case and there was this one photograph of a college runner , I remember , in a Columbia uniform , and he was holding his running shoes , leaning against a high hurdle and brushing his hair from his eyes while he smiled at you . I used to spend hours in front of my mirror at home , trying to get his expression on my face , imagining the day I would be able to send a picture like that back to the Hebrew school . " To Mr. Gleicher , a great coach , " the inscription on it would read , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the trophy case , on a wall with the plaques which represented trees bought in Israel , was the story we all knew by heart , about Mr. Gleicher , who had been a hero with the Haganah during the Arab  --  Israeli war in 1948 . The story came from an old issue of World Over , a magazine that was given out to Hebrew school kids all over the country , and there were pictures in it of Mr. Gleicher in his Haganah uniform  --  and one of him in his track uniform . That was what interested us most , P163I suppose  --  the fact that until he 'd had his knee blasted in an Arab mine field , he had been known as " the world 's fastest Jew " and was supposed to have been a sure bet to win all kinds of medals for Israel in the 1952 Olympics . According to the article , Mr. Gleicher had been born in Poland , but had fled to Israel with his family in 1988 . Then , when his father had died in 1940 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of their family who had escaped here from the Nazis . The article had a lot of stuff about how much they 'd been persecuted , and how many members of his family had died at which concentration camps  --  but the important thing as far as we were concerned was Mr. Gleicher 's track feats  --  his running times and medals and records  --  and how , when he was going to Brooklyn College , he 'd gotten the job at our school , teaching Hebrew to help support his family . It was a nice feeling to see the name of your Hebrew school in print . Except for the one year in the U. S. Army and the two years he 'd spent in Israel after the war had broken out there , he 'd taught at our school steadily since 1942 , and we 'd come in first or second at Field Day every year except for the three he was away fighting . The year most of us were in the sixth grade at P.S. 92 , though , we figured we did n't stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What had happened was this : all the guys a year ahead of us in Hebrew school who were good runners had had their Bar Mizvahs by about April  --  and , naturally , all of them had immediately stopped coming to Hebrew school . This meant that even though Izzie , Stan , Marty , and I were pretty good runners for our age , in the major event of the day  --  the Senior Relay  --  we 'd be racing against guys a year older . We knew our school would score its share of points in all the other races , but unless you came in first or second in the Senior Relay , you did n't stand much chance to win the championship and the Bar Kochba Trophy . Still , we worshipped Mr. Gleicher , and we kept tellingp164each other that if we tried hard enough , we could do it . So every day , starting about the middle of April  --  Field Day was scheduled for the second Sunday in May  --  we were out at the Parade Grounds practicing . Even on days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stop watch and a record of winningtimes for the last few years , and we drove ourselves until our tongues were hanging out , trying to equal them . We made progress , and you could tell from the quiet way Mr. Gleicher would encourage us that he knew how hard we were trying , but after a couple of weeks it became obvious that it was going to take a miracle for us to win . Then Elijah appeared . One afternoon , when there was no Hebrew school and we were out at the Parade Grounds by ourselves , running laps around the baseball backstops , he suddenly appeared beside us . " C'm on , Jewboys ! " he called . " Catch me , mothers ! " Then he was gone , flying by us as if we were standing still . He 'd slow down sometimes , but when we 'd be almost up to him , he 'd just laugh and take off again . The next afternoon , while the girls were off by themselves practicing their dances and we were jogging around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then to another , to take the lead , he showed up again . " C'm on , Jewboys , " he said . " Catch me , mothers  --  " We took after him as fast as we could , but he flew away from us as if , as Izzie put it , he had jets in his ass . Once , when we were coming around the last turn for the final fifty-yard sprint , he even turned around and ran backwardsfor about twenty yards , but we still could n't catch him . " You Jewboys sure can run ! " he laughed . When we had all collapsed on the grass in front of Mr. Gleicher , Elijah hardly seemed tired . He stood away from us , at a distance of about thirty or forty yards , leaning against a tree , watching us while Mr. Gleicher talked . " You must learn to breathe in regular patterns , " he said . " From down low . You must stretch your diaphragms . " None of us was listening top165him too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Gleicher had seen him too , we knew , and he smiled in Elijah 's direction  --  but he did n't say anything . On the way home that day , most of us were pretty depressed , and some of us even began complaining that Mr. Gleicher was n't such a great coach after all , that maybe it was his fault we were n't improving . Stan Reiss even said what I 'd thought a few times  --  how quiet Mr. Gleicher always was , how he never inspired you  --  but Izzie got mad at this . " A guy like that 's been through a lot , " he said , and he reminded us about his knee getting shot up , and about his wife . We knew that he had married an Israeli girl who had died in 1949  --  it said so in the World Over article  --  and from the first day we entered Hebrew school and we 'd heard about Mr. Gleicher from the older kids , they had also passed along rumors about her death , with some pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what they had done to her before they finally killed her . Then , just as Stan was telling Izzie he was sorry he 'd blamed Mr. Gleicher  --  we were at the corner of Caton Avenue and East 21st Street , outside the BMT station  --  Elijah was suddenly alongside us . " Hey , " he said . " You guys wan na buy things ? " We stopped  --  none of us knew quite what to do . What took us by surprise most , I suppose , was that he had come right up to us that way , as if what had happened at the Parade Grounds had never taken place . " C'mere , " he said , motioning to the wall overlooking the train tracks . " Make a circle round me so the cops do n't see . C'm on  --  you do n't got ta be scared . You with the stop clock , " he said , meaning Louie , " you be lookout . " There were about eight of us and we followed him to the wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarettes ? I got Chesterfield and Old Gold . I give ' em to you cheap  --  ten cents a pack . " " We 're in training , " Stan said.  | " Yeah . I seen you , " he said , and rolled his eyes . " Okay . " He put the cigarettes away . " I got some good rings  --  take any one you like , a nickel each , " he said , tinkling a handful in front of us . " You go to the store to buy ' em , they cost you forty-nine cents each . The ones with pearls cost eighty-nine , I let you have ' em for ten cents . How ' bout it ? " None of us said anything , and Elijah flashed his fingers in front of our eyes . On every one of them except the thumbs there was a different ring . " I wear ' em , you whiteboys can wear ' em too . Only these ai n't Woolworth rings . These the real thing I wear . This here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14-karat gold setting . You believe it . I get you these too , you do n't like the fake ones . " He looked up . He was a skinny kid , an inch or two shorter than most of us . " You wear these rings , you start to run faster . " He laughed , but none of us joined in . " Okay , " he said , putting the rings away . " I show you something else . I got some necklaces you can give your mother for her birthday . " He drew out pearl necklaces , then ankle bracelets , combs , fountain pens  --  but we still could n't speak ; it was as if he had us paralyzed . Even Izzie seemed flabbergasted . " How come you do n't want nothing ? Ai n't you got money ? My old man says you Jews got all the money . " He rolled his eyes again . " C'm on guys , buy something from me , huh ? I got to make some money today . I come home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips . " I tell you what I do for you  --  you give me orders , tell me what you want , and I see if I can get it for you . Get you good prices . " He took a pad from a back pocket and spit on the end of a chewed-up pencil . " What you want  --  baseball gloves ? some nice ties to wear for school ? a pipe for your father  --  ? " " Okay , " Izzie said , and we all jerked our heads toward him . " Can you get me a Pee Wee Reese model glove ? " I gulped , but Elijah 's face lit up . " Sure ! That 's easy , man ! " he said . " But you got to give me a deposit on it first  --  fifty cents down , a buck and a half when I bring the glove . "   " C'm on , " Izzie said , starting away . " How dumb do you think we are ?  --  You take our money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Izzie 's arm . " You can trust me , kid  --  honest . Do I look like a guy who 'd fade out on you ? I bring you the glove at practice tomorrow . I promise . " " Forget it , " Izzie said . " Look  --  I bring the glove tomorrow , you have the money ? " " Yeah  --  sure , " Izzie said . " Okay . " He turned to the rest of us . " You guys sure you do n't wan na buy a ring or a comb or something till then ? " He looked down at the sidewalk . " Oh boy , I just got to get some money , guys . You tell me what to do , I do it . I do anything for money ! " People started coming out of the subway then , home from work , and Elijah dropped back against the wall , gathering us closer around him so nobody would see him . When the train below had clattered out of the station and he told us again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy a comb for a nickel . The other guys followed my lead and inside of a minute Elijah had sold us a bunch of combs and rings and some candy . He seemed happy again  --  the way he had when he 'd been running in front of us at the Parade Grounds . " You guys saved my life ! " he said when we 'd finished our transactions . " Fifty-five cents I got now . At least my old man wo n't lay into me . " He walked us to Flatbush Avenue , then waved goodbye . " I see you guys tomorrow . You bring the money , Shorty , and I 'll have the glove . I got to split now . " Izzie acted as if he was mad that Elijah had called him Shorty  --  even though Elijah was no taller than Izzie -- but you could tell that he really felt pretty good that he 'd been the only one with enough nerve to order something . " Holy mackerel ! "  |p168he  kept saying . " Two bucks for a Pee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next afternoon , about twenty minutes after we 'd started practice , Elijah came running by us , waving a baseball glove in his hand . " C'm on , Jewboys , " he said . " You catch me , I give you the glove for nothing . " He took off and we took off after him , Izzie giving it all he had , but it was no use . No matterhow hard we ran , we could n't come close to him  --  and he hardly seemed to be trying . Mr. Gleicher watched what was happening , and he seemed to enjoy it . For the first time since we 'd begun practice , he was smiling . " Ma-hare ! Ma-hare ! " he shouted to us in Hebrew , and when we had finished our laps and lay stretched out on the ground in front of him , exhausted , he praised us , telling us he had never seen us run faster , that if we kept it up we would do well on Field Day . Elijah remained at a distance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rested for five minutes , we started running again , practicing passing the baton this time , and Mr. Gleicher shouted at us the whole time . " On your toes ! On your toes ! Ma-hare ! . . . Pump the arms , bevakasha ! Mahare , Izzie ! " Izzie was the anchor man for the relay team , and as he came around the last turn this time , after Stan had passed him the baton , Elijah joined him , running a few yards in front and tossing the baseball glove up and down in the air . " Ma-hare ! " Mr. Gleicher yelled , and we all joined in . " Mahare , Izzie . Ma-hare ! " Elijah kept laughing , his legs flying under him , and as they came by us , a few yards apart , you could hear Izzie muttering , " Black bastard . . . I 'll catch him . . . black bastard ... " Then there were suddenly three men running , and within five strides , busted knee and all , Mr. Gleicher had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his sweatshirt . He looked as if he were going to kill him , he was sop169angry . He shook him with both hands and lifted him up in front of him , gritting his teeth and hissing rapidly in Hebrew . Then he threw him down on the ground and we all ran over . For a minute I even thought he was going to kick him , but he did n't . He just clenched his fists and glared . " Hey , man , " Elijah said to Mr. Gleicher , wandering over to our group for the first time . " Why do n't you pick on somebodyyour own size ? " Izzie brushed himself off and looked up at Mr. Gleicher . " What  --  what was that  --  ? " Mr. Gleicher said , turning to Elijah . Elijah backed away now . " Hey , Shorty , " he said to Izzie . " I 'll give you your glove later  --  by the subway stop . This guy 's out of it  --  " Mr. Gleicher looked down as if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . He looked at his hands , then back at Izzie . " Come here , " he commanded Elijah . Elijah looked away . " I said to come here ! " he repeated , raising his voice , and Elijah shrugged and came toward him obediently , hanging his head . " What you want , man  --  ? " he asked , but there was little defiance in his voice . Izzie rose from the ground and took a step toward our group of guys , but Mr. Gleicher whirled on him , grabbed him by the arm , right on the muscle , and pulled him to his side . " You apologize to this boy , " he said to Izzie . He put his arm around Elijah 's shoulder , very gently , and bent down and whispered in his ear . Elijah whispered something back , and he stayed at Mr. Gleicher 's side , sort of leaning against him . " You apologize to Elijah , " he said to Izzie . " What for ? " Izzie said , and Mr. Gleicher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apologize for what you called him . I wo n't have it ! " " Okay . I 'm sorry , I guess  --  "  | " He has a name , " Mr. Gleicher said . " I 'm sorry , Elijah , " Izzie said , and Mr. Gleicher let go of him . He stayed next to Elijah , though . It was really strange , the two of them next to each other , Mr. Gleicher running his hand over Elijah 's head , and Elijah looking smaller than ever . " Where do you live ? " Mr. Gleicher asked Elijah . " With my father , " Elijah said , but he did n't look up . " And where is that ? " Elijah shrugged . " Away from around here . You do n't know . " " Do n't be afraid , " Mr. Gleicher said . " We are all your friends  --  is n't that right , boys ? " We mumbled that it was , and then Mr. Gleicher began going into this long lecture to us about brotherhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have expected it from him , it was the kind of speech the rabbi might have made , only less stern  --  and the longer he went on , the more Elijah smiled out at all of us from under his arm . A few times some of us started to interrupt him to tell him we did n't dislike Elijah at all  --  but I think we all knew it was useless to try to explain . " I did n't mean anything , " Izzie blurted out once . " I just wanted to catch him  --  " But Mr. Gleicher ignored him and went on about how as Jewish boys we had a special responsibility to befriend those others of the world who had suffered as the Jewish people had . I do n't think anybody had ever heard him talk so much . And just when we thought he 'd finished and was going to let us go , he reached into his pocket and took a photograph from his wallet . He looked at the picture for a while and it seemed to change his mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys . Sit down . I want to tell you a story . " There were about twenty or thirty of us altogether , not countingthe girls , and Mr. Gleicher sat down in the middle of us , suit and all , Elijah sitting cross-legged by his side , still leaningp171against him , and he passed the photograph around . It was a picture of an old-looking Negro man in an Arab-style costume , with scar marks on his face like you used to find of Africans in the National Geographic . " This story was not in the World Over , " he began , and then , as we sat there in absolute silence , for a good half hour he told us how two days after he had had his knee blasted and had been left for dead on the desert with all the other men in his unit killed , he had been rescued by a group of wandering black men . I forget what he called them  --  some tribe of nomads . At any rate , the important part of the story was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to health , transporting him across Israel with them , even though they were risking their lives whenever Egyptian or Syrianor Arab patrols came to check their camp . Mr. Gleicher went on about how the chief of these wandering black men was one of the wisest men he 'd ever met  --  like a rabbi from the time of the Temple , he said  --  but the parts we were most interested in , of course , had to do with the adventures and the close calls he 'd had while being taken across the country to Jerusalem . Then , when he 'd finished , he made each of us go up to Elijah and shake his hand . The thing I remember most was the strange look on Mr. Gleicher 's face , and the gentle way he kept running his hand over Elijah 's head , with his eyes shiningthe way they did in the World Over picture when he was wearing his Haganah uniform . And I remember thinking , becauseof the way he treated Elijah , that it would be nice if he married again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school teacher like Miss Berg , who taught us music on Sundays . " Hey , listen , " Elijah said to Mr. Gleicher when we 'd all finished shaking his hand . For a second , from the way he was eyeing Mr. Gleicher , I got scared he was going to ask him if he wanted to order anything . But he did n't . " I got a question forp172you , " he said . " How come you practicing running with all these Jew kids  --  ? " Mr. Gleicher smiled and told Elijah it was for Field Day  --  and then he started to explain why we celebrated Lag B'Omer the way we did , with races and dances . At first all of us sighed and got ready for the religious stuff we expected to hear  --  but instead Mr. Gleicher began to talk about the way the Jews had fought against the Roman armies eighteen hundred years ago , and about how , as in the Arab War , even though they 'd been outnumbered ten to one , they had been victorious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plague that Lag B'Omer commemorated , but mostly he spoke about the army of Jewish rebels led by Bar Kochba  --  the hero the trophywas named after . He told us how Bar Kochba lived in the hills , with bands of raiders made up not only of Jews , but of volunteers and outcasts and outlaws of all kinds  --  maybe even black people , he told Elijah . He described how , striking mostly at night , using bows and arrows and homemade weapons , Bar Kochba had conquered village after village , town after town , until the rebels had retaken the holy city of Jerusalem from the great Roman army  --  he made Bar Kochba seem like some kind of Jewish Jesse James or Robin Hood . I do n't think there was a single one of us who walked home that afternoon not feeling good about being Jewish  --  and not feeling that having to go to Hebrew school would n't have been half bad if there were more holidays like Lag B'Omer and more Jewish heroes to study like Bar Kochba . Elijah walked along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That guy 's got cool stories , " he said . " He 's okay . " When we got to the subway stop , he gave Izzie the glove and Izzie gave him the two dollars . Then he asked us what else we were going to buy . " You want some of them Jewishstars to hang around your neck ? " he asked . " Or some officialp173Major League baseballs ? How ' bout a wallet for your fathers ? " We were feeling good and a few of us ordered things from him . He seemed to like it more if you bargained with him  --  I remember I was able to get him down from sixty cents to a quarter for a baseball  --  and when we were done and he 'd put his pad away , he gave each of us a ballpoint pen , free . " That 's for good will , " he explained , " cause you guys are my good customers . " He giggled . "  --  Even if you do try to Jew me down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see you guys tomorrow . I have the goods . " Elijah showed up for practice the next day , loaded down with the stuff we 'd ordered , and he showed up the day after that , too . In fact , for the next two weeks , he was there every afternoon , running in front of us , saying the same thing , again and again : " C'm on , Jewboys  --  catch me , mothers  --  " And the more we tried to catch him , the more he 'd laugh . " You Jewboys are getting faster , though , " he said at the end of the first week , while he walked us home . " Must be those rings I been selling you . " " I do n't know if it 's the rings , or what , " Louie said . " All I know is , since you started running with us we 've cut our relay time by twelve seconds . If we can cut it down another eight or nine , we might still have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me some money , I come to that race next week , run in front of you , " Elijah said . " If it make you run faster , I call you worst things than Jewboy . I know some good words for Jews . " " We 'll see , " Izzie said , but from the way he was looking at Elijah , I could tell he was beginning to think about something else , cooking up one of his wild ideas . " We gon na see you at the movies tomorrow afternoon ? " " Sure , " Elijah said . " I promise you , did n't I ? I keep my word , you can count on that . " He put his arm around Izzie'sp174shoulder . " You guys my friends , like Mr. Gleicher says . Since you buying stuff from me , my old man treat me good . " " What 's your old man do ? " Louie asked . Elijah smiled and looked straight at Louie . " Okay . So long as we been friends a while now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then told us , real proud . " He 's a man of the Lord ! " He shook his head up and down and puffed out his chest . " He 's a minister of the church , the Lord spoken to him direct . Everybodyin our neighborhood scared of him  --  he make you scared blue if you meet him . " " A black rabbi ! " Izzie exclaimed , and when we laughed  --  thinking of our own rabbi , I guess  --  Elijah laughed too . " That 's pretty good , " he said . " We got a real black rabbi , though , lives a few blocks away . My old man hates him , says the Lord gon na strike him down . All his congregation too . Old nigger men , reading Jew newspapers  --  " Izzie 's eyes lit up , and he began asking Elijah about the black Jews . It was true , Elijah swore  --  you could ask Mr. Gleicher . In fact , he said , Mr. Gleicher had been talking to him about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their walk . Every afternoon that week , while we went through our exercises , Mr. Gleicher had taken a walk with Elijah down to the end of the Parade Grounds , where the good ballfields were , the ones that were fenced in all around , and had grandstands . Elijah swore to us that Mr. Gleicher knew about the black rabbi who lived near him  --  and had asked him all about the black Jews of the Tompkins Park synagogue . " My old man , " Elijah said , " he got nine wives , too . I told Mr. Gleicher all about them . I come from the first one , though  --  so I gon na be head of the church when he dies . " He suddenly stopped and looked around . " You guys wan na hear me talk in tongue ? " " Do what  --  ? " I asked  | " You never heard nobody talk in tongue ? " he asked , and when we all said we had n't , he seemed surprised . " I tell you what , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't charge you nothing . Then if you like it , we make up a price for after . " " Okay , " Izzie said , and we stood around Elijah in a circle . " Talk in tongue . " " Ca n't do it here , " he said . We were on Bedford Avenue , near Lenox Road . " Too many people around . " " Nobody 's home at my house  --  " I offered . When the guys piled into my living room a few minutes later I got out some milk , and the candy from my mother 's breakfront , and then Elijah told us to sit down around him and that we could help him by repeating what he said sometimes , or clapping our hands . He said he was n't sure he could do it without his father 's presence but that he would try  --  and then he started in . At first he just said some crazy sayings about Jesus Christ and the blood of the lamb and about the Lord coming into him . None @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ  --  not in my living room , anyway  --  but I remember clapping and saying things like " Come into my heart , Lord ! " and " Fill my spirit with the love of everlasting , " and short things like " Oh yes , Lord ! " and " Hallelujah ! " We were enjoying it , clapping and watching and repeating what Elijah said  --  and then he suddenly seemed to go crazy , jerking his body every which way , moaning like a wild man , and shaking his head back and forth as if it were attached to a pneumatic drill . He did n't need our clapping after that . The only thing he needed was our hands . He went around to each of us , falling on his knees , taking our hands and making us press them into his forehead and his eye sockets . After a while he started rolling around on the floor , saying he was seeing God , and God was working in him , driving out the devil  --  but now he was talking a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing home for the Lord , and I kept glancing at the door , praying that my mother would n't suddenly show up . The more frantic he got , the quieter we got . After he 'd stood up and shouted , with just the whites showing in his eyes , he suddenly seemed to go completely berserk , spouting stuff in a language none of us could understand , never seeming to take a breath . Then he shrieked and fell to the floor , rolled over once , and lay there . I was sure he was dead . We sat on the edges of our seats , staring . " Holy mackerel ! " Izzie said . Elijah lay perfectly still , his arms stretched to either side , his head on his shoulder , one foot crossed over the other . His chest did n't move and we were petrified , not knowing what to do . " I  --  I think he stopped breathing , " I said . Louie suggestedwe put a mirror under his nose , to see if he was alive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elijah sat up . " That 's speaking in tongue , " he said , smiling . He really gave me the chills when he sat up , I remember  --  worsethan in a horror movie , when a dead person suddenlycomes to life from a coffin . " How you like it ? " " Are you okay  --  ? " I asked . " Sure , " he said , shrugging . " You Jews never see any of that stuff , huh ? " He took a piece of chocolate from the dish on the coffee table and popped it into his mouth . " I do better than that in the church  --  my old man says I 'm the best he ever seen for a boy my age . How you like it , huh ? " We all sort of nodded that we liked it , but it was as if we were in a daze . " I tell you what  --  you get some more guys to come up to one of your houses , pay a dime each , I put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He ate another piece of chocolate . " Man , I get hungry after speaking in tongue . Mouth dry , too . You got some soda ? " he asked me . I went into the kitchen and brought him a bottle of Seven-Up . " Anyway , this was nothing , " he went on . " You get ten or fifteenp177guys , I really go good . This just coming attractions . " He handed me back the bottle . " I got to go now , before your folks come home . They wo n't like me here  --  that 's for sure . I see you guys tomorrow . Twelve-thirty , in front of the Flatbush Thea-ter . " We met him the next afternoon  --  there were about ten of us , including Kenny Murphy and Corky Williams , who did n't go to Hebrew school  --  and we chipped in for a ticket for Elijah , plus a nickel a man for getting the rest of us in . Then we stood around the big fire-exit door on Church Avenue , flipping picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In about ten minutes the door cracked open , the hinges squeaking . " C'm on , " Elijah whispered , and we raced inside the theater while he held the door open for us , handing each of us a ticket stub as we flew by . Izzie and I stayed together , jumping into two seats up front , and when the manager came down our aisle with the matron , accusing us of having sneaked in , we showed him the stubs Elijah had picked up from the floor , saying we 'd paid the same as anybody else . He grumbled and went away . In those days the Flatbush Theater was the last place in Brooklyn where they still had vaudeville shows  --  my folks would go with Louie 's parents sometimes on a Saturday night  --  and we used to have a good time on Saturday afternoons , wise-cracking and throwing popcorn at the people on stage . It was the noisiest theater I 've ever been in , and besides the stage show , they used to show three movies . The afternoon we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We loved the Bowery Boys , and Izzie was pretty good at imitatingLeo Gorcey and the way he 'd use fancy words in cockeyedways  --  I remember what a great feeling it was after the movie , walking down Flatbush Avenue with all the guys ,  |p178getting  Izzie and Corky to rank each other out , making believe they were Mugs and Glimpy . The best part , though , was repeating to each other what a great idea it was to have Elijah get us in and give us ticket stubs . I think we all felt that he was a genuine part of our gang now , like Sammy in the Bowery Boys movies . I guess most of us had always secretly hoped we could have one Negro in our gang , the way the BoweryBoys did  --  but until Elijah , we never had . We had lots of Negro kids in our class at school , but they all lived in a rundownsection about three blocks on the other side of the school  --  six or seven blocks away from us  --  so that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we hardly ever saw them afterwards . They had their own gangs and teams , and where we grew up you hung around pretty much with the guys from your own block . After Elijah had left us that afternoon and we were ready to break up and go home for supper , Louie reminded us about Field Day . Having Elijah for a friend was great , he said , but it was n't going to help us come in first . " I 'm not so sure about that , " Izzie said , narrowing his eyes the way he had a few days before when I 'd seen the idea begin to stir in his head . We pressed him , but all he would say was , " I got a plan . You leave it to me . " When Izzie explained his plan to me on Monday , I told him he was nuts , that Elijah would never go along with it , and that even if he did , Mr. Gleicher and the rabbi would have fits . But Izzie said he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into action . For the rest of that week , Elijah went for two private walks every afternoon  --  one with Mr. Gleicher and one with Izzie . The guys bothered Izzie and Elijah a lot , trying to get them to tell us the plan , but Izzie and Elijah just smiled . " We got a secret , " Elijah said . " Sure gon na surprise you Jew-boys  --  "  |p179Mr  . Gleicher noticed that the two of them were palling around a lot , but this only made him praise Izzie to the rest of us , telling us that we should follow his example . Mr. Gleicher was a changed man by then , and we were beginning to believe that he probably was the world 's greatest coach . He knew more about running than anyone I 'd met , and he kept after us day after day  --  teaching us how to breathe correctly , to run on our toes , to lean forward and pump our arms the right way . It was as if the things he taught us were secrets that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . By Wednesday afternoon , Louie informed us that we had clipped another four seconds from our relay time  --  and we were slowly becoming convinced that we might get the Bar Kochba trophy after all . By this time something else had happened also . We 'd run out of money , and Elijah was talking about leaving us and findingnew territory . " There 's lots of Jewboys in Brooklyn got money to spend , " he said . We pleaded with him , pointing out how much we 'd already bought from him and telling him that in a week or so we 'd have saved up again from our allowances . He told us it was n't personal , that he liked us real well  --  we were his good friends  --  but business was business . " He 's right , " Izzie said , and he and Elijah went off together for one of their mysterious sessions . You had to hand it to Izzie . When the stakes were down , he always came through in style . The next afternoon  --  in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bunch of guys from Hebrew school who had n't been with us the first time , and he got Elijah to speak in tongue for them . And on Friday Izzie even talked a half dozen girls into coming to watch , gettingthem to pay fifteen cents apiece , instead of a dime . Elijah went to town for the girls , and by the time he finished and lay stretched out on the floor , they were terrified . A couplep180of them went hysterical  --  screaming and crying and shivering  --  and I was a little worried the neighbors would hear . It took a good three or four full minutes till Elijah sat up this time , and when he did , even he was in a daze . " Man , that 's more like it , " he said , shaking his head . " I know I done good when I do n't know exactly what happened . " He smiled at the girls . " That 's speaking in tongue , " he said to them . " How you like it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grounds the next morning , and in the afternoon we went to the movies , the way we had the Saturday before . Elijah was glad to see us . " Sure need that money , guys , " he said . " The old man 's putting the pressure on  --  I got this brother , a year younger , he been bringing in almost as much as me , trying to push me out . " He turned to Izzie . " Our deal still on about tomorrow ? " " Sure , " Izzie said . " Okay , " Elijah said . " You guys wait by the door . Let 's have your money . " We had a good time again at the movies , but it was hard to relax completely with the track meet one day away  --  and afterwards , when Louie and Izzie and I got together at my house , we spent most of the time figuring out the points for the different races , and where we would have to place to have a chance for the trophy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured , giving us the benefit of the doubt on all the individual races  --  which meant having guys like me and Izzie placing in the top three in dashes and broad jumps  --  we still did n't stand a chance unless we won the relay . My father came into my room once or twice and I guess he noticed how sad-faced we were . When he teased Louie the way he always did , this time by claiming that Phil Rizzuto was a better all-around shortstop than Pee Wee Reese , Louiep181just shrugged . My father left our room to speak to my mother , and then he came back and asked Louie and Izzie if they 'd like to stay for supper . They said okay  --  Louie went upstairs and got permission and Izzie telephoned home  --  but sitting around the table eating we only got more depressed . After supper , for a special treat , my folks took us to Garfield'scafeteria for dessert , but we were n't too hungry . I had some rice pudding with raisins , I remember . I looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bad for them because they were trying so hard to cheer us up . I wished I could get some conversation going , for their sakes , but I could n't think of anything to talk about . Then Izzie nudged me under the table and motioned with his eyes to a corner of the room . There was Elijah , going from table to table with a stack of newspapers under his arm . The minute he saw us , he smiled and came straight for our table . I was n't exactly sure how to act with my parents there , but Elijah shook his head sideways before he got to us  --  he could see Izzie was going to say his name , I guess  --  and we played along with him . " You wan na buy a newspaper , mister ? " he said to my father . " No , thanks , " my father said , without looking at Elijah . " You sure ? " Elijah said . " I got the early morning edition already . " My mother sighed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the Daily News , " he said . " What paper you read ? " Elijah asked . " I get it for you . You just name it . " Maybe if my father had known more about Elijah  --  and about what had been happening with him and our group of guys  --  he would have acted differently , but I think he was alreadypretty annoyed and tired from work all week , and he be/gan to get a little angry , raising his voice to tell Elijah that he had already told him he did n't want a newspaper . " Maybe you want to get one for your sons here  --  so they can read the comics  --  " " Please go away , " my father said , and his tone of voice made me scared and I tried to get Elijah 's attention . My father was a quiet man , but if he got annoyed he had a mean temper . " Ah , croon , mister , only fifteen cents , " Elijah said . " And I need the money real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " If you do n't stop bothering us , I 'll call the manager and have you thrown out , " my father said . The angrier my father got , the more Elijah persisted . He even put the newspapers down on a chair and took out some pearl necklaces , asking my father if he wanted to buy one for my mother . Izzie , Louie , and I fidgeted in our seats , not knowing what to do . I wanted so much for my father to buy something from Elijah  --  I remember closing my eyes and trying to concentrate hard and think the idea into my father 's head  --  but it did n't help . He would n't buy anything , and Elijah would n't go away . " Man , " Elijah said finally , picking up his stack of newspapers . " You Jews sure are cheap . " This got my father . He raised his hand as if he were going to hit Elijah . " C'm on , bigshot , " Elijah said . " Hit me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you pick on somebody your own size ? Yeah . I like to see you mess with my old man . He lay you out flat  --  barn ! " " If you do n't leave this instant , " my father said , " I 'll call the police . " Elijah turned and walked away . I guess you could n't reallyblame my father  --  him not knowing about Elijah and Elijahsaying the things he did  --  but I felt terrible anyway . My father and mother talked for a while about the incident , with my mother trying to calm my father down  --  and Izzie andp183Louie and I whispered about Elijah , wondering if he would still keep his deal . My father caught some of our conversation and asked us if we knew Elijah . We said we did n't , but I guess we denied it too hard , because he was very suspicious , and my mother chipped in with some choice comments on young men being known by the kind of friends they kept . Izzie and Louie thanked my parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they left . " Go on , " my father said a minute later . " Go catch up to them  --  but be home within an hour . " I thanked him and ran out of Garfield 's , past the Flatbush Theater , and down Church Avenue , making a left on Bedford  --  that was the way we usually went . At Martense Street I could see the two of them , walking together up by Linden Boulevard . I was about to call to them to wait , when Elijah came running up beside me . " Hey , Howie , " he said . " Hold on . I got to talk to you  --  " It was the first time , I think , that he 'd ever called me by my name . " Hi , Elijah , " I said . He still had a stack of newspapersunder one arm . " That your old man in the restaurant ? " he asked . " Yeah  --  " " He call the police ? " " No , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just got a bad temper . " " You sure he ai n't called the police ? " " Sure , " I said . We crossed over Linden Boulevard , and Elijah stayed next to me . " I 'm real sorry he said what he did to you . He 's not usually like that . Honest  --  " " You tell him my name ? " " No . " Elijah grabbed my arm and pushed me against a hedge . " Tell the truth , man  --  you tell him about me ? "  | " Quit shoving , " I said , and pushed his hand away . " I told you the truth  --  he did n't call the police and we did n't tell him who you were . We made out like you were a stranger  --  " Elijah looked both ways . " Your old man following us  --  ? " " No --   --  He brushed my arm with his hand . It was wet . " I 'm sorry I shove you , " he said . " You want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thanks , " I said . " Man , the police get me , I be in trouble . My father , they do n't like him much , either . " It was dark along Bedford Avenue , and I could n't see much of his face . Just his eyes . " The police , they real mean . " He tugged at my arm . " Listen , Howie , you make sure your old man do n't call the police on me , I get you lots of things , you do n't got to pay . Okay ? " I told him again that my father was n't going to call the police , but it did n't seem to matter . " I be your best friend , Howie , okay ? You give me any orders you want . Just do n't want them making blood out of me . The police , they get paid by the Jews , my old man told me . And the Jews , they run everything in this city , lots of kids disappear when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " That 's the one , " he said , shaking his head up and down . " They get little kids , there 's blood , man . I heard stories .  --  Please , Howie , you tell your old man I did n't mean nothing back there , so long as he do n't report me . " He stopped . " I even go through with my deal for tomorrow . I do n't charge you nothing , either . You tell Shorty and Louie I said so . " He straightened up and grabbed my arm . " Only you call the cops on me , there gon na be blood . " He giggled . " My old man find out what I do , there be blood anyway . " He laughed some more . " I like to see his face , he find out what I gon na do . Oh man , it burn his ass  --  " He stopped suddenly , and the smile leftp185his face . We walked about a half block toward Rogers Avenue without saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stoop in front of my building . Elijah pulled me over under a tree . " Listen , I got your promise , do n't I ? " " Sure , Elijah . " " My brother , I think he on to what we gon na do . He squeal on me , man , I 'm dead . " He shook his head and whistled . " Izzie , though , he got some good points . I go along with him . See you tomorrow , Howie  --  " Then he left . The next morning Louie 's father drove Izzie , Stan , Marty , and myself to Wingate Field and we met the other guys by the handball courts . Mr. Gleicher too . It was a beautiful spring day , I remember , and the place was already filled with hundreds of guys , all practicing starts and running around the track . In a little while the stands began to fill and we followed Mr. Gleicher 's advice , just jogging around the track , not trying to impress anyone by how fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were there and a lot of people from the neighborhood around Wingate Field , and it felt pretty good , running around on an official track  --  it was a black one , made of cinders  --  with over a thousand people watching . Some of the other schools had uniforms , but all we had were these little shields the girls had made for us out of oaktag , with the name of our school on it . We pinned them to the front of our T-shirts . The whole place was in chaos , it seemed to me , with little kids chasing each other , girls practicing their dances , music playing over the loudspeaker , and teachers and mothers walkingacross the track to talk to kids  --  but once the man in charge announced that the track meet would begin soon , things got organized . We looked for Mr. Gleicher on the infield of the track , where all the teachers were , and we found him right away . They played " The Star-Spangled Banner " and then the " Hatikvah , " and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , for us to pin on the back of our shirts . He had a list of the events on a sheet of paper and while speeches were going on and girls from different schools were dancing around as if they thought they were on the plains of Israel , he told us which events came when and who would run in which races . There were all kinds of things you could get your school disqualified for  --  and the thing he tried to impress on us most was to stay in our spot of the field until our individualrace was called . Last year , he reminded us , we had lost points because the judges had found one of our guys sitting in the stands , eating lunch . Just before the first race , they unveiled a table of trophies and medals and you could hear everybody go " Ooh " when they did . And when they announced that the winner of Field Day the previous year  --  and the current holder of the Bar Kochba Trophy  --  was Congregation Shaare Torah , we cheered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guys from the other Hebrew schools looked our way . Izzie got into some good name-calling with a group of kids from Judea Center , which was in our neighborhood , and when they taunted us about havingall our older guys graduate , Izzie yelled back that we had a secret weapon . Elijah had n't shown up yet . The announcer called for the guys in the first race , a fifty-yard dash for kids in the first grade of Hebrew school , and Mr. Gleicher got them around him in a circle and reminded them not to look back or stop running when they reached the finish line . The kids listened when he talked , and he was very gentle with them  --  the way he 'd been with Elijah . Mr. Gleicher warned us again to stay in our places , and he went over to the finish line . From where we were you could n't see much of the race , but when it was over and we saw one little kid from our schoolp187jumping up and down , with all the other kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gleicher came back carrying the kid on his shoulders and we gave him a 2  --  4-6-8 cheer andtold each other that this was it , we were going to do it again , nothing could stop us . Izzie even borrowed Louie 's ballpoint pen and had him write " Bar Kochba 's Raiders " on his T-shirt , and all of us followed his lead . The track meet progressed pretty much the way Louie had it figured  --  we did real well in the lower grades and better than we 'd expected in the individual races in the upper grades . When the time came for the individual races for seniors , we were in second place , a few points behind the East Midwood Jewish Center . " If we can just pick up a few third places in the senior events , " Louie told us , " we can still do it . " Stan and Marty had come in second and third in the race for guys in the next-to-last-year , and Mr. Gleicher had Izzie and me scheduled to race in the senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other guys , though , I think we 'd forgottenhow much bigger than us most of them were . Our race was a hundred-yard dash , and even though we swore to each other that we would give it all we had , I think we knew we did n't stand a chance . " Gleicher should of raced us with guys our own age , " Izzie said . " Then we could of at least had a first place for sure  --  " The starter told the runners to take their mark and my heart pounded . Izzie got down in position and set his jaw . " Relax , " I whispered . " And come up slow  --  " " Got you , " he said , without looking my way . An instant later the gun went off and the line of us  --  fifteen to twenty guys  --  started out . Izzie and I ran neck and neck and for the first twenty or thirty yards , before you really picked up speed , we stayed with the leaders . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in first place . Being small helped himp188get a good start . But then , even though I strained with all my might , a few guys passed me and stayed ahead . The same thing happened to Izzie . One guy in front of us , from East Midwood , must have been about six foot one or two , with the longest legs of a guy our age I 'd ever seen , and as we passed the halfway point he opened up a lead of almost ten full yards on the rest of us . Then Elijah showed up , running along the grass on the inside of the track , waving to me and Izzie . " C'm on , Jewboys , " he called . " Catch me , mothers ! " " Yippeee ! " I shouted  --  I was so happy to see him  --  and as I did I gagged and stumbled , knocking into a guy to my left . The two of us flailed away with our arms for several yards , and then went down in a heap . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and churning his little legs as fast as they would go . As I lay on the track and watched him , I could hear in my head the words he was saying , and when he 'd gone past the tape and one of the judges had motioned that he 'd come in third , I jumped up and ran straight for him and we hugged each other and danced around like maniacs . " I knew I could count on that black bastard  --  " Izzie said . " I knew it ! I knew it ! " We ran back to our group of guys and they surroundedIzzie , punching him around and telling him how great he was . We got a little scared a minute later when the guy I 'd knocked down complained to the judges that our whole team should be disqualified , but they ruled that it was nobody 's fault , and Izzie 's third place stood . Elijah sauntered over to our group then and Mr. Gleicher gave him a big hello , telling him how glad he was to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down with the rest of the guys , as if he was one of us . The broad jump was next , but Izzie and I did n't even come in in the first five in either the standing or the running events and when the announcer said over the P.A. system that the senior relay teams should report to the starter 's table for thep189final event of the day , Louie told us that we were now in third place , eleven points behind East Midwood and eight points behindTemple Petah Tikvah . The relay counted for fifteen points , and when we realized that the guy who had won the hundred-yard dash was from East Midwood , we all felt we were done for . That was when Izzie put his plan into action . " I got a stomach ache , " Stan Reiss said to Mr. Gleicher . " I think you 're gon na have to get somebody else to run for me . " Mr. Gleicher looked around . " You better pick one in a hurry , " I said , and Izzie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving for the track . " My stomach hurts real bad , " Stan said . " Okay , " Elijah said , standing up . " I 'll run for you  --  " Izzie nodded toward our group of guys and we took our cue and cheered and started slapping Elijah on the back . Mr. Gleicher smiled at us and put his arm around Elijah 's shoulder . " That 's very nice of you , Elijah , " he said . " But I 'm afraid you 're not allowed  --  " Izzie was ready . " Why not ? " he asked . " You been telling us yourself how we should treat him like he was one of us . " He looked at Elijah and Elijah hung his head . " It 's not that , " Mr. Gleicher began . " It 's  --  " " All that stuff about prejudice and him being an honorary member of our class , " Izzie said . " Boy ! " he exclaimed . " You ai n't gon na let me run ? " Elijah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , but the P.A. announcerinterrupted with a call for the Congregation Shaare Torah Relay Team , and we told Mr. Gleicher that he 'd better hurry and decide on a substitute for Stan or we 'd lose  --  and if we did n't come in in the first three in the relay , we would finish fourth or fifth in the total scoring . That had n't ever happened since Mr. Gleicher had been coach . Izzie nodded to Elijah . " Look , " Elijah said to Mr. Gleicher . " I want to be a Jew/boy  --  " He lifted a chain from under his T-shirt and showed it around . It had at least a dozen Jewish stars on it , all differentstyles . Mezuzahs too . " Izzie been working with me , teachingme , " he said . " Honest , Mr. Gleicher . Izzie , he says that if you let me run with the team , that finish me off with the first training for being a Jewboy . " He whipped a yamulka out of his pocket  --  a white silk one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like that  --  began talking in Hebrew . " Baruch Atoh Adonai Shalom Shalom  --  " Mr. Gleicher looked confused . " Honest , I run real ma-hare , show you how much I wan na be a Jewboy . Please , Mr. Gleicher  --  " He began kissing his Jewish stars , one after the other . " Please let me . Aleph Bes Gimel Shalom . Please  --  " By this time Elijah had such a painful look in his eyes that even I was beginning to believe him . Then he started in about how Mr. Gleicher had to let him be Jewish to save him from his father . " Oh man , " he pleaded , " you just got to . I been studying so hard . Listen  --  Baruch Atoh Adonai Shalom Sha-lom --  " " Last call for the relay team from Shaare Torah  --  " came the announcement , and Izzie and Louie and I stormed Mr. Gleicher with the arguments we had ready , telling him that he himself had said Elijah was our brother , that color did n't matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he 'd been with us for weeks now and had learned his prayers " Forget it , " Elijah said , pulling himself away from Mr. Gleicher . " He 's the same as all the rest . People always promise you  --  " Then Mr. Gleicher was holding Elijah 's hand and runningthrough the crowd of kids with him . It all happened so fast after that that to this day I 'm not sure exactly what happened . Maybe the judge had a lot of respect for Mr. Gleicher , or maybe he felt sorry for Elijah , or got confused , or  --  who knows ?  --  maybe Mr. Gleicher even swore on thep191Torah that Elijah was a Jew and a member of our class . All I know is the judge pinned a piece of paper with a number onto Elijah 's back and showed him where the anchor men were lined up . When the big guy from East Midwood said something about Elijah being Negro , Izzie just said , " What 's the matter , you stupid or something  --  you never heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudiced Hebrew school do you go to ? " and before we knew it the gun had sounded and Izzie had shot out ahead of the pack , running like a madman , his arms pumping , the baton clenched in his fist . By some miracle he held on to a slight lead on the first leg of the race , but after he 'd passed the baton to Marty we began to lose ground steadily . I was number three relay man , and when I began trotting in the passing zone , and took the baton in full stride from Marty , we were already in third place , about ten yards behind East Midwood . I gave it all I had , trying to make believe Elijah was in front of me , as if nobody else were on the track except us , with him laughing and calling me Jewboy  --  and I guess it helped , because when I reached Elijah for the last leg I had almost overtaken the number two man . " Watch me go , Jewboys , " Elijah said as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " I got Jewgas in my legs ! " The big guy from East Midwood was about fifteen yards ahead by now , but in no time at all Elijah was breezing past him , running free and easy , and laughing in the big guy 's face . He only came up to his chest , but he moved his legs across the cinders as if his toes hardly touched the track . The crowd was going wild and in the middle of the field you could see the kids from our school throwing their jackets and sneakers and stuff in the air . Even Mr. Gleicher was yelling and cheering , and when Elijah came to the last twenty yards or so , he did what he used to do with us  --  he ran backwards ! We got worried for a second ,  |p192because  the guy from East Midwood chewed up the ground fast  --  but then Elijah straightened out the right way , and broke the tape about ten yards ahead of the other guy . " Mazel tov ! " Mr. Gleicher shouted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud , the yamulka still perched on the side of his head , we shouted it with him . " Mazel tov , Elijah ! Mazel tov ! " we screamed  --  laughing , happy . " Hurray for Elijah the Jewboy ! " Izzie yelled , and we all hugged him and pounded him on the back and then Mr. Gleicher hoisted him onto his shoulders and limped around the track with us in a pack around him , giving Elijah Mazel ton 's and 2  --  4  --  6  --  8 's and every other cheer we could think of . When Mr. Gleicher let Elijah down from his shoulders onto the grass , the two of them looked happier than any two guys I 'd ever seen . " I run pretty good for a Jew , huh ? " Elijah said . " We gon na get that big trophy now ? " he asked . We told him we were but that they had to announce it first and give out individual medals . " Bet we could get a lot of money for that trophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us as if he owned the place . What he loved most was to see the looks on the faces of the kids from the other Hebrew schools when they 'd come over to stare at him and he 'd rattle off the words Izzie had taught him . " What 's the matter ? " Izzie kept asking them . " You stupid or something ? You never learned about the black Jews ?  --  What kind of crumby Hebrew school do you go to ? " While they were giving out the medals for the winners of races , Mr. Gleicher was called away by the director of Field Day , and they kept glancing at Elijah . Mr. Gleicher was getting angrier and angrier , and when our rabbi suddenly showed up in his black suit , trying to look important and get into the discussion , Mr. Gleicher became furious . You could tell that he and the rabbi did n't get along well , and as the argument gotp193more and more heated a group of people crowded around them . Then the rabbi pushed his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uh-oh , " Elijah said . " Time to split  --  " " But they 're gon na give out the trophy in a minute , " Izzie said . " I knew my brother 'd do it . Help me , guys . Help me . " He clutched at my arm . " Do something , Howie . Please . Oh Lord  --  I got to move , but I ca n't . Oh Lord  --  " Mr. Gleicher had finished arguing with the judge and he caught up to the rabbi and we heard him pleading with him . But the rabbi kept marching toward us . Over the P.A. system we heard the news : Congregation Shaare Torah had been disqualified , and the East Midwood Jewish Center was the winner of the Bar Kochba Trophy . " No ! " I shouted . We groaned and looked at each other helplessly . " No ! No ! " I yelled again , and some of the guys joined me . " If you 're up there , Lord , now 's the time to show your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Midwood ran by us , laughing and screaming , and I swallowed hard to keep from crying . It did n't help . Some tears came anyway , and the same thing happened to Izzie and Louie and the others . It did n't even matter that the rabbi was standing in front of us . At that moment we could n't have cared less what he said or did . " Help me , guys . I been your friend  --  " Elijah was saying as he crouched behind us . And then , just as the rabbi was about to lecture us , this Negro man appeared , planting himself between us and the rabbi . He was a short man , about the same height as the rabbi and wearing a black suit just like him . The only difference was in their hats . The rabbi wore a black one , but the Negro man had on a crazy turban thing with capes and scarves flowingp194from it . Behind me I could hear Elijah muttering . The Negro man looked our way and I 'd never seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his jet-black face made the rabbi 's eyes seem harmless . There were jewels in his turban , and rings on his fingers . His neck bulged from his white shirt and there were two long scars that crisscrossed his right cheek . We moved back a step . " You the Goldberg made my son do this ? " " I am not Goldberg , I am  --  " the rabbi began , but Mr. Gleicher stepped in front of him . " It was my fault , " he said . " You a rabbi ? " " No , but  --  " Then the Negro man shoved Mr. Gleicher aside . " The wrath of the Lord be upon you ! " he proclaimed , and let go with an uppercut right to the rabbi 's chin . The rabbi fell back and Mr. Gleicher caught him . People were screaming everywhere , crowding around us , calling for the police . " Now 's your chance , " Izzie said to Elijah . " Through the crowd  --  " " You see the shot he give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing again . " That 's my old man . I told you , did n't I  --  ? " Elijah 's father came toward us and we shoved Elijah back , but not in time to keep his father from reaching through and grabbing . He got him by the chain and began pulling and you could see it begin to cut into Elijah 's neck , making the flesh show like raw steak . " Now ! " I said , and we all shoved back against Elijah 's father . Elijah screamed and then the chain snapped and the Jewishstars and the mezuzahs flew into the air . " Won that race , " I heard Elijah say . I saw some spots of blood on his T-shirt . " Won that race fair and square . " His father pushed us away , but this time Elijah got his feet moving . He made his way through the crowd and streakedp195down the track . When he reached the trophy table , he snatched the big gold cup in full stride , then raced for the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to the exit , he stopped . He raised the Bar Kochba Trophy over his head , yelling at his father to try to catch him . We all cheered and ran toward the exit , tripping over each other on purpose , getting in his father 's way . " Shalom , Elijah ! " Louie yelled , and we all did the same . " Shalom , Elijah ! Shalom ! Shalom ! " Elijah waved the trophy over his head once more , then kissed it . " Shalom , Jewboys ! " he yelled . " I see you around  --  " Then he took off out the exit , swinging the trophy at his side , running fast as lightning , and I think we all knew that that was the last time we would ever see him.  |p197ALL  MORNING he had been sitting on the porch of his cottage , trying to decide whether or not he should kiss her when she came for him . The minute Dr. Klein had told him that he was giving him a pass to go out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . He had meant to ask the doctor , had almost done it , in fact , but then had reconsidered . " What do you want to do , Billy ? " That would have been Dr. Klein 's reaction . Billy knew he would have thought it was a silly problem  --  and he knew too that if Dr. Klein had thought it was more than silly , the pass might have been taken away . Still , he wished now that he had brought it up . He did n't want to do the wrong thing again  --  the way he had last summerwhen they 'd taken him to his Aunt Harriet 's . And only three months ago , on his first pass since the previous summer , he had embarrassed them again . Nothing as bad as at Aunt Harriet 's , when he 'd been the center of a big scene , because this time he had n't been allowed to visit anyone . Instead , they 'd gone to a movie together , near the hospital . Afterwards ,  |p198when  they were at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met a friend , and although nothing was said , Billy knew they had been ashamed of him , of the way he looked . He had been on heavy medication at that time , and the longer his mother 's friend had stared at him , the harder it had been for him to keep his eyes open . He had tried , but after a while , he remembered , they had become too heavy . " Wan na play ping-pong ? " It was Ira Gordon , a new boy at the hospital . Billy shook his head sideways . " Boy , you 're all dressed up . Got a pass ? " Billy nodded . He did feel dressed up . Joan had ironed a shirt for him ; Arthur  --  the boy who slept next to him  --  had loaned him a tie , and he had even used shampoo in the shower that morning . He wanted to look nice this time . Not like the last time , when his mother had said that she did n't have to ask him what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menu . She had meant the criticism good-naturedly  --  as she had when she 'd commented on the length of his hair ; still , her remarksdisturbed him . " I wish I had a pass , " Ira said . " Where are you going ? " " To the beach . My parents belong to a beach club . On Long Island . " Ira whistled . " Wow  --  I 'd give anything to go swimming . I love to swim . I really do . I made junior lifesaver at camp two years ago . Do n't you love to swim ? " Billy nodded . He wanted Ira to go away . " Sure you do n't wan na play ping-pong ? " Billy was sure . Ira sat down in a chair opposite Billy . He kept rubbing his hands together . Billy tried not to look ; he wanted to stay calm . " There 's never anything to do around here , " Ira said . " I ca n't even leave this lousy cottage . Not unless an aide comes with me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ball games , do you ? " Billy said he did n't like ball games either , butp199he hardly heard what Ira said after this because he had already spotted his parents down the road , coming from the AdministrationBuilding . His mother reached him first , his father a step or two behind , toting a big shopping bag . " My Billy ! Dear  --  " Before he could do anything , before he had a chance to reply , she had leaned down toward him and her cheek had touched his own . He sniffed her perfume , started to rise , and his lips turned swiftly toward her cheek and pressed in on the skin . His eyes , wide open , looked at her ear , hidden behind wisps of grayishgoldhair , and as his lips stayed on her cheek he realized that her lips were n't on his . Her arm was on his shoulder , though , and as he rose to a full standing position  --  he was about four inches taller than his mother  --  he touched his hand to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backwards . " How are you ? It 's so good to see you , Billy . It 's been so long ! Is n't it wonderful ? A whole afternoon at the beach , away from here  --  " She noticed Ira , standing , staring at them . " This is Ira Gordon , Mother , " Billy said . " He lives in my unit . " Mrs. Fisher shook Ira 's hand . " Well , I 'm always glad to meet Billy 's friends . How are you , Ira ? " " Are you really taking Billy to a beach club ? " Ira asked . Mrs. Fisher nodded . " Well , I got ta see somebody , " Ira said . He turned and went into the cottage . " Put it down , Oscar , " Mrs. Fisher said , glancing to her left . " There 's no need to carry it all the time  --  and come say hello to your son . " Billy and his father shook hands . " So , how 's my boy ? All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He turned to his mother . " Your hair looks very beautiful . " " Why , thank you , Billy . Thank you . " She turned aroundp200so that he could see the back . " Do you really think so ? The man at the beauty parlor who does my hair  --  he said he thought this little bit of gold in the gray would lend just the right touch . Do you really like it ? " " It 's very beautiful . " " Is n't he sweet , Oscar ? " Billy 's father shrugged . " Your father  --  if I had my head shaved , he would n't notice . " Mrs. Fisher laughed . " Oh well , come , Billy  --  let 's see what 's in the bag . All right ? I do hope you like the things I 've put together for you . " He thanked her for the underwear , the new pair of Bermudashorts , the Ban-Lon shirt , the hair tonic , the magazines , but he told her he was n't allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can just take it along to the club . " " Let me sign out  --  I 'll put this stuff in my room . " As soon as he was a few steps away he heard them whisperingto each other . Something about his posture being better , but still too " slouchy , " his mother said  --  she wished he would n't always be looking at the ground . Billy smiled for the first time that day . That was one good thing about the drugs ; they sharpenedyour sense of hearing . His father said he thought Billy looked perfectly normal , that maybe he 'd be out soon . He did n't hear what his mother said to that , but when they were in the car , on the highway headed toward the North Shore , she kept telling him what a good time they were going to have . " You do look a little pale , Billy  --  do n't you get much sun ? " " The drugs make me dizzy if I 'm in the sun  --  I 'm still on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father said . " Last summer , when he came to Aunt Harriet 's with us for the picnic , how he broke out in a rash  --  "  | " I forgot . " She put her arm around Billy 's shoulder and shook her head sideways . " My poor baby . " " You 're no baby , are you , Billy ? " Mr. Fisher said . " Oscar ! Watch out  --  you almost hit that car  --  you should see the way that man gave you a look . " " I do n't think I feel good , " Billy said . " You want to sleep , son ? " Her arm went further around his shoulder and his head rested on her , low , near her bosom . He remembered how she had comforted him at Aunt Harriet 's when all his aunts and uncles were standing in that circle around him , watching , waiting , muttering  --  were some of them crying ? He did n't understand why anyone would cry . Maybe it had been what he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because he could n't really remember what it was that he had said ; only that as the sun had made him dizzier , just before his stomach had given way , his mother had argued with his father , and Billy had joined her , yelling and screaming when his father would n't listen to him . " Poor thing  --  maybe you 'd like to stop for a Coke ? That always settles your stomach  --  remember how I used to keep a bottle of Coke syrup with us whenever  --  " " I 'm okay now . " He sat up . " It was the sun shining on me . " Of course , dear . You know I was saying to your father , when you were in your room before we left , that to look at you , there 's not a thing wrong with you , Billy . You 're a little confused , mixed up . Of course . Who is n't these days ? And I 'll tell you something else  --  if you ask me , you never would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband and sighed . " Well , there 's no sense going into that story , is there ? We 're here to have a good time ... " Billy looked out the window at all the other cars and wondered if he 'd ever be able to drive ; there was so much to think about when you drove : the other cars , the brakes , thep202speed limit , people , turns , signs , the gas level , the oil  --  his fatherwas a good driver . Billy just wished that they could speak to each other about things sometimes . But they rarely did , even on days like this when they had n't been together for weeks . His mother was still talking , her hand lightly touching him now and then as she used it to punctuate her sentences . " One thing , though , Billy  --  and I 'm not sure how to approachthis . I certainly hope you wo n't take it in the wrong way  --  but I see no need to tell people where you are now . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now do n't be upset  --  if anybody asks you where you 've been , just say you 're living with our cousins , Martha and Sam , in Maine for the summer . All right  --  ? " He nodded . " Well , " she continued , " I just see no need for people to know now  --  when you want them to know , then it 's time enough . Even the doctors said there 's never any need for people to know until you want them to  --  " " I wo n't tell anybody . " " Good  --  there 's nothing to be ashamed of about where you are , either , Billy . I hope you understand that . It 's just other people . Let 's face it  --  even you would n't want to be there if you did n't have to  --  " He smiled . " I know , " he said . " You  --  you have to be crazy to want to be there  --  " They laughed and his smile broadened and soon he was laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father said . " He never loses his sense of humor . " " You are precious sometimes , Billy , " his mother said , betweenlaughs . " Oscar  --  do n't laugh so hard . You should n't be so funny , dear  --  you 'll distract your father  --  "  |p203At  the club , he put on a bathing suit so he would n't appearto be out of place . All the boys and girls his own age , though , were down at the beach , swimming , sunbathing  --  and , because of the sun , he could n't join them . His mother and fatheroffered to play cards with him . At first he said he 'd rather not ; to please them , though , he let himself be talked into a few games of gin rummy . Then he excused himself , saying he wanted to take a walk . As he wandered around the club , he noticed that his mother kept glancing up from her beach chair  --  then from the table where she was playing Mah-Jongg  --  to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glances , he slipped into the TV lounge and sat down where she would n't be able to see him . The lounge was glass-enclosed and air-conditioned , with easy chairs all around . A ball game was in progress on the TV and he watched for a while . In the back of the room , two teenagers  --  the boy might have been his own age  --  were sitting on a couch necking and Billy tried not to look their way . He did n't want to embarrass them . The girl 's hands were caressing the boy 's neck and shoulders , her fingers stroking , stroking while the boy clutched her . Billy noticed that the boy 's bare chest was pressed against the girl . Once , coming up for air after a long kiss , the girl caught Billy 's eye and he did n't know what to do . He was afraid she would say something to the boy , would involve him in an argument , but she only curled one corner of her mouth , indifferently , condescendingly , and then  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she exhaled slightly , and her lips , wet , parted , searched for the mouth of the boy . The next time he turned around  --  two innings had passed , though he could n't have said which team was ahead  --  they were gone and he felt relieved . Outside the lounge , on the shuffleboard courts , a group of children were playing . A little girl in a red bathing suit wasp204examining another little girl , who was stretched out on the ground , mouth open . A little boy  --  he was the doctor  --  had a spoon pressed inside the girl 's mouth , and the girl in the red bathing suit , who had an empty Dixie cup on her head , kept giving the doctor orders . In her right hand she held a pail from which she took invisible things that she applied to the patient . She pushed the doctor away now and began wrapping what must have been gauze around the patient 's head , then picked her up by the elbow , patted her lightly on the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other children sitting in a row and one of them ran forward and sat down . The girl sent her back to the waiting room , conferred with the doctor , and then took one of the patients by the hand  --  not the one who had come forward  --  and sat her down on the ground . She stuck a Popsicle stick in the girl 's mouth and took her pulse . Billy laughed . The little girl had the biggest blue eyes he 'd ever seen . Two mothers came along after a while , and the children all clapped and shouted  --  they were going to be taken swimming . The girl in the red bathing suit ran in front of all of them , her blond ponytail flapping up and down , her pail swingingout from her side . Billy was surprised at how graceful she was for her age ; and he was particularly taken by her legs , which were n't at all pudgy . In the middle of a beer commercial he left the lounge . It was hot outside , but a cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He was hungry and went to where his father was playing pinochle and asked for some money . At the snack bar he ate two cheeseburgers and sipped a Coke . Only a few old people sat around the clubhouse . Somehowit seemed to him that when he was young there had been no old people at the club . Before his mother had sent him away to camp , when he was thirteen years old , he had spent all his summers at the club . If asked , he could n't actually have saidp205what he had done during those summers , but he knew he 'd had a good time . When you were with friends , you did n't have to be doing anything special . He and his doctor had talked about this , because whenever Dr. Klein asked him what he had been talking about with his friends at the hospital , he could never remember . That , he told Dr. Klein , was what made them friends . With friends you did n't have to talk about something special ; you just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did remember doing . In the men 's locker room , right next to the drinking fountain , to the right of the shower , in locker 267  --  he rememberedexactly  --  there was a hole that they used to take turns looking through to see the women undress . The locker had always been one of the open ones , for guests to use . Billy wondered if it was still there and he finished his Coke and left the table . He walked into the locker room , down the first aisle of lockers , turned right , then left to the end of the room . He wondered if any of the younger boys would be there now , looking through the hole . He turned the corner and breathed more easily . Nobody was around . No noise in the showers . He looked to either side , then opened the door . To his surprise , nothing happened . He put his hand inside and rubbed it across the back ; a piece of cardboard moved . His heart thumped , louder , and he wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his hand . Then , looking down the aisle once more , he thrust his head in , pushed the cardboard aside , and pressed his eye to the cool metal . He exhaled in relief as he spotted no women . He closed his eyes , opened them , and was about to move back and close the door when the girl in the red bathing suit came into view . She was wearing a blue bathing suit now and was being pulled along by her mother . Billy moved closer to the back wall of the locker , pressing his eye flush against the metal . Thep206mother sat the girl down in front of a large locker , almost directly in front of Billy . " One more chance , " he heard the mother say . " I 'll give you one more chance . " The girl sat and stared at her mother , her jaw set , her eyes fiercely defiant . The mother pointed , and shouted this time . " Now get going  --  " Billy switched to his left eye and pressed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the locker cut into his left shoulder , but he wanted to see where the mother was pointing . A few feet to the right , several women were talking , some of them half undressed . He looked away quickly , back at the girl and her mother . The girl did n't budge . She had her pail in her lap , and Billy saw the Dixie cup in it . The girl looked up , toward the mother , then away , to the right , directly at Billy . But she did n't seem to have noticed him . He licked the sweat that slipped off his upper lip , then drew his bottom lip under his teeth and sucked away the salt that had collected in the crevice between his lower lip and his chin . The mother grabbed the girl and shook her . " I know your ways , young lady , " she said , holding onto the girl 's arm . " So help me God , though , if you do n't go back and say excuse me to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girl thought , then her eyes opened wider and she smiled : " Then you 'll have to sit with me  --  " The mother sat down . " Okay , miss smarty-pants , we 'll see who can wait longer . " Billy pressed his face to the side again as the girl got up and walked toward the women . She was almost past them and still had n't said anything . " Get back here , godamnit ! " " There 's enough room to go by  --  " the girl protested . " I do n't need to say ' scuse me . See  --  ? " She pointed to where the women had stepped back.
