They all laughed when the U.S. Army introduced the " E63 Manpack Personnel Detector " for experimental use in Viet Nam . The device , a 24-lb. chemical and electronic version of a nose , was designed literally to smell the body odor of concealed enemy troops . Now the G.I.s-and presumably the Viet Cong , too-are more impressed than amused . The " People Sniffer , " as it is known in the field , has demonstrated that it can locate hidden enemy forces and has been ordered for dozens of U.S. infantry and artillery units . <P> Developed by General Electric and the Army 's Limited War Laboratory , the E63 is based on a phenomenon often demonstrated in high school chemistry classes : if open bottles of ammonia and hydrochloric acid are placed close together , a white cloud of ammonium chloride particles forms above them . These particles serve as nuclei for the condensation of the air 's water vapor into tiny , foglike droplets . <P> B.O. Beeps . In Viet Nam , the ammonia is produced by groups of perspiring men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacteria on the skin and decomposed into odorless carbon dioxide and ammonia gas . Thus the air in the vicinity of a large group of men-especially in hot and humid climates-contains high concentrations of ammonia . To detect the ammonia , the E63 scoops up air , passes it over a wick saturated with hydrochloric acid and into a humidifying chamber . If the air contains any ammonia , a fog forms , changing the amount of light shining on a photoelectric cell and varying the amount of electric current that it produces . The current variation in turn increases the frequency of a beeping sound in the operator 's headphones and produces a higher reading on a meter , warning him that there are men near by . Higher concentrations of ammonia-presumably produced by larger numbers of men-produce a denser fog and higher meter readings . <P> Although it was originally designed to be carried on the back of a foot soldier , the E63 has been used most effectively aboard a helicopter . Flying above the treetops at speeds as high as 100 m.p.h. , helicopters equipped with People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombing zones " - areas cleared of civilians where anything that moves is regarded as fair game . On the basis of E63 readings , artillery fire has been called in and flights of B-52s have been dispatched to saturate the suspicious area with bombs . <P> The device is effective only when operated into the wind . Carried by the leading man in a patrol , for example , the E63 will pick up the odor of patrol members themselves if the wind is at their backs . But it is sensitive enough to pick out an upwind enemy sniper lying in ambush at distances greater than the range of most rifles . " There 's no question about it now , " says Lieut . Colonel Alvin Hylton , chemical officer of the 1st Infantry Division . " It works . "
