Though at 33 he is already a veteran of countless brushes with death or dethronement , Jordan 's King Hussein has never faced a challenge quite as taxing as the one he faces now . His country is seething with frustration over losing the fertile land of the Jordan River 's West Bank . His people increasingly show their open admiration for the self-styled commando groups of Palestinian Arabs that are striking out against the occupying Israelis . Before Hussein can consider making his peace with Israel , he must leash the commandos . Last week , as the king prepared to fly back to Amman after a month of rest and minor medical treatment in London , the shock waves of struggle were reverberating throughout his kingdom . <P> The immediate cause was a perceptible move toward negotiations with Israel . In indirect contacts in New York and London , both sides spelled out in more detail than ever before their terms for a settlement . Israel offered to with draw from most of the occupied territory and to give Hussein custody of Jerusalem 's Moslem shrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on retaining the Old City , while Hussein demands its return , as well as repatriation of Arab refugees . <P> Fedayeen Power . Even those highly tentative talks have stirred the revolutionary feelings of the commandos , or fedayeen , who are adamantly opposed to dealings of any sort with Israel . They wield political power in Jor dan far out of proportion to their numbers , which probably total no more than 5,000 active terrorists . They have the fervent support of Jordan 's 700,000 displaced Palestinians , who owe no particular allegiance to the Hashemite Hussein , and the open sympathy of many officers in the Jordanian army . <P> More and more , the commandos operate as a state within a state . They occupy the Jordan River 's East Bank and defy government requests that camouflage-uniformed fedayeen stay off the streets of Amman . When a Bedouin army unit tried to disarm a group of commandos at a checkpoint outside the capital last week , Fedayeen Leader Yasser Arafat rolled up two jeeploads of commandos and threatened to shoot his way through . The army backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fedayeen , Hussein can count on the loyalty of Jordan 's 20,000 Bedouins , whom he has recently been placing in army units , but not on his politicians . Last week angry fedayeen leaders called on Hussein 's Prime Minister , Bahjat Talhouni , to claim that they had discovered a palace plot to arrest some commandos and pressure politicians to cease supporting them . As Palestinian refugees braced for battle , the Cabinet sided with the fedayeen , conceding them full freedom of movement and promising to resign en masse should the plan go through .
