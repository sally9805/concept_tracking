With fireworks exploding the morning sunlight , a 16-float parade snaking past new-laid sod and sudden flowers , and the beaming presence of the Vice President of the United States , the New York World 's Fair came out for the second round last week . Everybody in volved - from terrible-tempered Robert Moses down - was determined to profit by experience . And profit was of the essence : the fair 's first season ran up a rocking $17.5 million deficit and sent four pavilions into bankruptcy. * <P> Not that the fair was foul . Last year 's 27 million admissions were more than any fair anywhere has drawn in the same period of time . But this was about 10 million fewer than Bossman Moses had projected . There had been plenty of grumbles . The price tags were higher , for exhibitors and fairgoers alike , than anyone seemed to have counted on , the queues for the most popular shows were almost unbearably long , the transportation system seemed to have been devised by a committee of leprechauns , the so-called Amusement Area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p.m. - hardly an inducement to New Yorkers who had to work during the day . <P> A Porpoise on the House . So this season was ushered in with a great rustling of new leaves being turned . Some of the big exhibits have taken steps to shorten their waiting lines by opening earlier , staying open later , taking advance reservations for seats , increasing auditorium seats ( General Electric ) or speeding the flow with an extra door ( Ford ) . The three-car Glide-a-Ride trains have been rerouted and coded with color to make their destinations less of a mystery , and the $9-an-hour , four-passenger Escorters-famed for their frequent breakdowns-have been eliminated altogether . Admission is up 50 to $2.50 , but there are more free shows . Florida 's trained porpoise , for instance , which cost $2 for adults and $1 for children last year , is now free , as will be an elaborate water ski show when it opens May 8 . Admission to the 4,000-ft. monorail ride ( 80 for adults , 60 for children ) now entitles one to unlimited rides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Les Poupes de Paris , has cut its $2 admission price in half . <P> And in addition to some $2,000,000 spent on refurbishing the old exhibits , about $5,000,000 has gone into creating new ones . Items : <P> &gt; The Churchill Pavilion has been mounted with great skill by Designer Philip George in the vast and vacant geodesic dome that was called the Assembly Hall . The story of the great man 's life is told in a walk-through illuminated by 500 photographs , after which visitors find themselves surrounded by 32 charming Churchill paintings , which amply demonstrate that he was no mere Sunday painter. * Also on display is a reconstruction of his study at Chartwell , and more than $1,000,000 worth of Churchill memorabilia . <P> &gt; The People-to-People Fiesta is a miniature world 's fair in itself-a bazaar with booths of more than 40 nations . Here foot-weary fairgoers can picnic , entertained by strolling musicians , craft demonstrations , and a peppy , swinging ballet about Manhattan staged by youngsters of the Police Athletic League .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
