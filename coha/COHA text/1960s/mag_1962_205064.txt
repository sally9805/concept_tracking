In Pittsburgh last week the Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corp. , largest U.S .. producer of stainless steel , lopped 2% off its prices on key grades " to make ourselves competitive . " Coming hard on the heels of a recent 12% price slash by California 's Kaiser Steel Corp .. which virtually eliminated the historic differential between Eastern and Western steel , and last month 's sharp reductions ( as much as 19% ) in posted prices by the Aluminum Co. of America , the Allegheny Ludlum move was the latest evidence of a general softening in the prices of industrial materials . According to the Labor Department , U.S. industrial prices as a whole are less than 1% above the 1957-59 average , have actually declined slightly since last January . If this is a victory over inflation , it is not an easy one to celebrate because it results from bruising competition for customers who just are n't buying . <P> Soft Metals . Rubber prices have dropped 1.8% so far this year under the growing pressure of synthetic rubber , which now has 73% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past two years because of overcapacity , which has been aggravated by the entry into the business of such heavyweights as W. R. Grace , Schenley , Armour , and several oil companies . <P> Few industrial groups have been hit harder than metals . Producers of lead have lowered prices by 3% this year to fight a domestic glut and foreign competition . Tin has tumbled 13% in anticipation of sales from the U.S. stockpile ( TIME , Aug. 17 ) . In steel , the Labor Department index shows that prices overall have slipped two-tenths of 1% so far this year ; on certain kinds of pipe , wire and bars , steel producers have been quietly granting discounts of 5% to 20% . <P> One reason for the fall in steel prices is that imports of steel jumped almost 50% ( to 2,800,000 tons ) in the first eight months of this year , while exports ( 1,300,000 tons ) showed only a 2% rise. * More important , domestic demand has been so disappointing that production in the first week of October fell 1% to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tinplate is off because the canning season is over , and galvanized sheet is soft because of the tailoff of the construction season . Worst of all , orders from Detroit are below expectations-largely because the stockpiles that the automakers built up last winter as strike insurance were apparently much larger than steelmen thought , and the auto companies are still living off their inventories . <P> Hard Times . All this is good news for the nation 's contractors , builders and manufacturers of retail products . Though few of them can be expected to pass on their savings to the consumer , many of them can well use the lower prices they are paying for materials to fatten skimpy profit margins or to help offset the upcreeping costs of research , transportation and labor . But it is not good news in the judgment of President Kennedy 's favorite economist , Paul Samuelson of M.I.T. Says he : " If prices sag when we have high employment , full-capacity production and good profit margins-that 's good . But if prices sag because profit margins are lousy , excess capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep at least 96% of our workers working-that 's bad . " By that measurement , what is happening now clearly is bad . <P>
