What are prisons for ? To reform criminals , replied of the 77% of nation 's Americans in " correctional " a recent Harris Poll . But 80% of the nation 's " correctional ; " employees merely guard 426,000 inmates in a hodgepodge of archaic institutions that range from adequate to appalling . Only 20% of the coun try 's correctors work at rehabilitation . And 30% of all released offenders ( 75% in some areas ) are reimprisofied within five years , often for worse crimes . <P> What eludes U.S. penology ( from the Latin poena , meaning pain ) is the basic recipe of effective punishment : speedy , inescapable prosecution , a fair chance for a fresh start , and state-upheld values that offenders can reasonably acknowledge as superior to their own . For one thing , 77% of reported U.S. crimes are never solved ; many are never even reported . Thus , most caught criminals see their problem as bad luck rather than bad character . Indeed , such are the human mind 's defenses that the guilty often feel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act as " not a crime . " <P> All the more resistant is the typical U.S. offender : a failed male youth who wears the outcast labels of slum dweller , minority-group member , school dropout , unsuccessful employee and law violator . Stripped of selfesteem , this loser compensates by hating and hurting life 's winners . And the U.S. criminal-justice system all too often reinforces his contempt for society 's values . If the suspect can not afford a skilled lawyer , he is pressured to plead guilty without a trial . For the same crime , different judges hand out wildly disparate sentences . <P> Perhaps the most appalling aspect of all this is the fact that the number of crimes is increasing because the number of young people is growing , and they commit most crimes . Viewing this situation objectively leads to two basic conclu sions . First , the U.S. is now spending $1 billion a year for corrections in ways that can only increase crime . Second , a dramatically different approach can decrease it - for the same money . <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a surprisingly recent idea . Before the 18th century , prisons were mainly used not to punish but to detain the accused or hostages-the debtor until he paid , for example . To combat crime , Europeans castrated rapists , cut off thieves ' hands , tore out perjurers ' tongues . England boasted 200 hanging offenses . When crime still flourished , reformers argued that overkill punishment is no deterrent . In 1786 , the Philadelphia Quakers established incarceration as a humane alternative . Seeking penitence ( source of " penitentiary " ) , the Quakers locked convicts in solitary cells until death or release . So many died or went insane that in 1825 New York 's Auburn Prison introduced hard labor-in utter silence . Until quite recently , the U.S. relied almost entirely on the spirit-breaking Auburn system of shaved heads , lock-step marching and degrading toil in huge , costly , isolated cages that soothed the public 's fear of escapes .
