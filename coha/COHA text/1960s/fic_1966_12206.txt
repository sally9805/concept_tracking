( CURTAIN OPENS : A room , disorderly arranged . There is an unmade bed , on which are several scattered newspapers ; older newspapers are stacked on top of an old chest . Large sheets of drawing paper or canvas rest on a table along with pencils , crayons , and paint brushes ; a typewriter , at edge of table ; at one side of the room are several buckets of used paint . On the walls are old posters or parts of placards which read : YANKEE GO HOME , U.S. OFF VIETNAM , FREEDOM NOW , CHRIST SAVES ; mounted placards are arranged around the floor and around the room with other protest slogans : BAN THE BOMB , MONTGOMERY RE-VISITED , MARCH TO FREEDOM , etc . The place is Germany , 1965 : lights come up slowly on empty room ; off stage , there is the sound of foot-steps racing up the stairs behind the door ; another pair of foot-steps follow in a slow , rhythmic , almost marching cadence . As stage is fully lighted , enters a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying a small package . Wearing simple trousers , tennis shoes , sweater , and leather jacket , he immediately drops package on the bed , and races across the room ; he enters another door hurriedly , anxiously : there is a pause , as the foot-steps with marching cadence approach the door . Sound comes from the door where boy entered : A toilet being flushed ! ; entering the room door is an American Negro , U.S. Army Officer . The Negro officer stands in the doorway scrutinizing the room ; he apparently finds the disorder disagreeable . The White young man exits from the toilet door ; less agitated : the officer attends him . . . ) BUD ( to officer ) I made it , Johnny ! p. 3 JOHNNY ( as he casually looks around room ) Thank God !

JOHNNY When possible , we like to be in a " state of readiness " . . . ( picks up a placard which reads : FOLLOW YOUR CONSCIENCE ) . . . the life you save , may be your own ! BUD ( takes wine , cheese , and bread from package ) If there weren't so many pople on the streets , we would have been here sooner . JOHNNY ( as Bud looks for a place to sit the bottle ; Bud removes all the debris from table to the bed . ) How about that ? Some were carrying flags . My arm is damned tired from saluting so many flags . Must be a parade somewhere . p. 4 BUD ( sarcastically ) Everybody knows , the Germans love parades. . . right ?

( Bud breaks the stare : he searches for wine glasses ; Johnny inspects a chair ; opens his white handkerchief fully ; wipes chair ; sits at table as Bud places two wine glasses on table . ) BUD ( referring to wine glasses ) Voil ! JOHNNY ( still wearing hat ; rubs his feet ) Well done ! ( satisfied , Bud draws up a chair opposite Johnny ; he sits and begins to open wine : Johnny interrupts ) Chess ? BUD Huh ? JOHNNY You forgot the chess set . BUD Ha ! . . . you know . . . you 're right ! ( leaves bottle ; hustles up in search for the chess set ; Johnny rubs his toes ; finally , takes off his hat and gently places it on the edge of the table . Bud returns with the chess set , placing it between them ; he pours the pieces onto the board and continues to open the bottle. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't play much . . . .

( no response from Johnny ; Bud slices bread ) . . . but , the aggression . . . it works against my grain . . . JOHNNY ( soberly ) That 's part of the game . BUD Oh , I know , but I find it difficult to plan an attack . JOHNNY Simple ! You accept one policy on how to use your pieces . . . then move accordingly . BUD That 's logical enough . . . but then , suddenly . . . you 're defending positions backed against the wall . . . What a strain ! JOHNNY Bud , with the right spirit and understanding , one can defend any positions . BUD ( nibbling a piece of bread ) Sounds fair . . . ( Johnny inspects bread knife ; replaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOHNNY I was " green " once . BUD ( looking up surprised ) You were ? p. 6 JOHNNY ( returning glance ) I got over it . . . quick !

( he turns the board around so that the Black pieces are on Bud 's side ) BUD I suppose it 's my initiative . JOHNNY The simplest way to victory . ( after observing pieces , Bud moves pawn up one square ; Johnny looks at lonely pawn quizzically ) . . . Interesting move ! ( Bud begins to pour wine into Johnny 's glass ; Johnny aborts pouring by placing hand over glass ) . . . Milk ! BUD What ? JOHNNY Milk ! BUD ( perplexed ) Milk ? ( Johnny nods head affirmatively ) . . . . I do n't have any . JOHNNY Why did'nt you tell me back at the cafe ? BUD I only said I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some ?

( Bud gives him bottle ) BUD ( as he pours wine in his glass ) These Germans drink as much milk as Americans . JOHNNY Good idea ! BUD You should see them . . . that heavy cream just oozes all over their thick lips . ( Johnny stares critically at Bud , as he wipes the cream away from his lips with handkerchief ; Bud 's expression changes from levity to discomfort : he retreats to chess pieces ) . . . Er . . . I think it 's your move . ( Johnny moves a pawn , then begins to drink milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at pieces as Johnny finishes the glass of milk , leaving cream around lips a second time : a bit disconcerted , Johnny furtively wipes off the cream . . . in the same motion , polishes his officers " bars " on uniform : they both exchange a couple of mo JOHNNY You 're holding back your pawns . BUD The threat is stronger than the execution . p. 8 JOHNNY Buddy , who told you that shit ? BUD That 's my game . . . holds up oppositions attack . . . right ? JOHNNY Not when there 's a White pawn-storm brewing over those Blacks . BUD ( takes a pawn from Johnny ) See ! . . . there 's an advantage . JOHNNY ( moves in quickly with a Rook ) Where ? ( he takes the advance pawn of Bud ) . . . just a simple sacrifice to get through your pawn shield . BUD ( jumps up from table ) That 's great ! ( he places typewriter on his lap as he sits on bed typing ; eraces ; types ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bud types ) You see , the attacking pieces force the opponents pawns to advance and thereby open up a path for the attacking combat troops . . . it's. . . it 's . . .

You ca n't know nothing ' bout marching until you 've got a firm knot up under your ankles . BUD With a U.S. Official Stamp on my knee , I suppose . JOHNNY That 's it , Buddy . p. 11 BUD That 's pretty queer coming from you , Johnny . JOHNNY ( indignantly ) There 's nothing queer about me , Buddy boy ! I 'm American ! BUD ( irritated retort ) Then what am I ? JOHNNY That 's up to you to decide !

( Bud 's enthusiasm descends ) BUD ( soberly ) Does the man behind the uniform know what war he 's fighting ? JOHNNY Is the Pope Catholic ? BUD It 's not your war .

JOHNNY ( detached ; attending game ) Why did'nt you say that ? BUD You know , as well as I , " Coloured " is idiomatic . JOHNNY ( picking up White chess piece ) What colour is this ? BUD White .

Quickly , Johnny draws his revolver ; slowly he advances on door , moving ( . . . Bud aside : he swings open the door fast . There stands a large crate , marked CARE , on which is secured a note : they first stare at each other , perplexed ; Johnny begins to drag it in quickly ; Bud stands puzzled , holding his placard languidly at his side . Johnny searches the hallway ; cautiously , he holsters his revolver ; closes door ; takes note off crate ; looks at note , then at Bud 's anxiously anticipating face : reads ) p. 33 JOHNNY " The time has come for all good neighbors to return favours .
