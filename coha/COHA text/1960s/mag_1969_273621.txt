THE PRESIDENCY <P> Like many American families , the mobile Richard Nixons have had no permanent home . Since World War II , Nixon 's career has taken them to Washington , California , New York and now Washington again . But Dick and Pat Nixon were raised in California , and last week they were wrapping up final details to buy a house that could re-establish their roots in their old state . <P> Their White House West will be Cotton Point , a spacious adobe villa in the resort town of San Clemente , 50 miles south of Los Angeles . The location appeared ideal for a presidential retreat . The weather is dry and sunny nearly year-round , offering a respite from muggy Key Biscayne summers . There is privacy ; the house sits on 20 sequestered acres on a bluff between the ocean and the coastal highway . There is even the convenience of nearby Camp Pendleton , with a handy helicopter pad for presidential commuting . <P> Wooded Seclusion . The classic red-roofed Spanish house was built 45 years ago by Henry Hamilton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His widow , now 90 , still lives there . Cotton brought Mexican artisans to lay the tile floors and build furniture and thick , wood-pegged doors . The house encloses a warm , sheltered patio with a fountain , outdoor fireplace , lawn and shrubbery . All five bedrooms open on the patio . Nixon likes seclusion and is especially fond of a semicircular library , reachable only from an outside stairway . Wide living room windows overlook the ocean . <P> Initially , Nixon wants to buy the seven waterfront acres , including the house and gardens , with their flourishing trees , for an estimated $400,000 . He is also dickering for an option on the remaining 13 acres of the estate , to assign to a " friendly " buyer of his choice . One of the last points to be worked out was the purchase of some of the handmade furniture . The President has also been negotiating the sale of his 12-room New York City apartment , and Pat said they have had 16 offers . It is expected to bring the President about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list price was $135,000 . The Nixons are not planning beyond the White House years , but San Clemente may well become their permanent home ; they are planning to use it as their voting address . Although they spent a househunting weekend there in March , they were not the first presidential visitors . One summer afternoon in 1935 , Cotton hosted a barbecue for 4,000 guests , among them Franklin Roosevelt .
