txt A Poison That Kills Only RatsReported ; City W atches Tests Sy 3-01-1N A. OSMUNDSEN A Pennsylvania chemical laboratory has developed a new weapon against one of the oldest and costliest scourges of , mankind  --  the rat . The weapon his what appears to be the per:feet rat poison . The compound , its makers , say , is cheap , potent , fast-actling and ? most important ? kills rats and apparently nothing but rats . No other animals lof more than 30 tested so far , not even mice , have succumbed , ' the developers of the compound ! reported here yesterday . Just why the poison works only on rats is a mystery that has aroused considerable interest among biologists . Damage Is Widespread But there Is no mystery about what benefits might accrue from the widespread use of a compound that would kill rats yet leave all other kinds of animals unharmed . The rat has been called the most expensive animal man maintOns , in terms of both dollars and lives . It has been estimated that ' rats have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plague , or the black death , and rat-bite fever  --  than ' all the wars of history . Estimates of the annual property damage and food spoilage caused by rats in this country run between $2.5 billion and $1.5 billion . A New York City Health Delaartment spokesman said that // the Bureau of Pest Control had been observing field trials that the developer had been conducting in Harlem . One of the principal limitations on rat eradication programs tip to now has been the hazard that all rat poisons have presented to pets , livestock , useful wildlife and humans , particularly children . Now it appears that all such restrictions may be off . For example , in 134 field trials of the new poison , " no accidental poisoning of any wild or domestic animal was recorded . . although in a few instances baits were known to rave been consumed by dogs , cats , hogs and chickens , " according to the Colorado Wildlife Research Center in Denver . The new compound , named Raticate , was made by scientists at the Laboratories in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was formed to produce the poison . Both are subsidiaries of Johnson &; Johnson . Poison Demonstrated In a dramatic demonstration at the Overseas Press Club yesterday , the compound was force-fed to six rats , half a dozen mice , several goldfish , a couple of chickens and two small dogs , a terrier and a beagle . Each dog and chicken was given enough poison to kill 100 rats , a company scientist said . Thirty minutes later the cages contained barking , clucking , squeaking and swimming animals ? and six dead rats . The first white rat died 23 minutes after it had received a single dose of the poison . Death seemed to be painless . The compound usually acts in 15 minutes to four hours , according to Dr. Adolph P. Roszkowski , the scientist who is credited with its discovery . The poison makes the rat 's blood vessels constrict , thereby starving vital tissues and organs of blood . Heart failure and asphyxiation result . Dr. Roszkowski said that he had discovered the compound 's unusual properties by accident while screening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-inflammatory action , which might have been useful in treating arthritis . One of the compounds was a substance called norborene , for short . It had no apparent effect whatever on mice and dogs , Dr. Roszkowski said . " But when we tried what I had projected as a safe dose on rats , all of them died , " he said . Then came the long series of tests on other animals . The poison was lethal for every rat tested  --  Norway , roof and Hawaiian  --  but had no measurable effect on the other animals , Dr. Roszkowski said . Although it has not yet been tried on humans , he said , there is reason to believe that it is safe for them . Injections of it in the skin , which cause local vascular damage in rats , , produced no observable effect on humans , he said . H. W. MelTey , president of Laboratories , estimated that the cost of rat eradication with norborene , or Raticate , would be about half that with standard anti-coagulant rat poisons .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
