In many forms of leukemia , the blood-cell factory inside the victim 's bone marrow produces too many white blood cells , of the wrong kind , and too fast . To get the marrow back on a proper production schedule , medical investigators have tried many ingenious , drastic and daring experiments . Now five Paris doctors believe they have found a possible answer in the blood and bone marrow of a patient 's relatives . <P> The French physicians , led by Dr. Georges Math , got the idea from the emergency treatment improvised in 1958 for victims of a reactor accident in Yugoslavia-five nuclear scientists who got what would ordinarily have been a fatal overdose of radiation . Four were pulled through and are still doing well , thanks to injections of bone marrow . The radiation that almost killed the patients had made them able to accept other people 's marrow cells , instead of rejecting them through nature 's familiar " immune reaction . " <P> Last spring , when some of the same doctors had a male patient of 26 dying of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But whose marrow ? His parents were still living ; so were three brothers and a sister . Rather than trust their own judgment in picking which relative had the closest-matching marrow cells , the doctors left the choice to nature . <P> <P> First they gave the patient a hefty dose of gamma rays-enough not only to knock out his bone marrow but to kill him , unless he soon got some more marrow . Within a week , they report in the British Medical Journal , they injected into his veins two quarts of a mixture of blood and bone marrow drawn from all six of his closest kin . <P> Then , although he was kept in an atmosphere as nearly germ-free as possible , the patient got sick . He developed a usually fatal form of tuberculosis : evidently some bacilli had been dormant in his body , and the radiation had destroyed his defenses against infection . Somehow , today 's miracle drugs pulled him through , and his new marrow is still manufacturing new cells . <P> Which of his relatives saved him ? <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells they think it was his youngest brother . Their shotgun attack with cells from six donors , they suggest , gave the patient 's own system a chance to select the most suitable marrow .
