Fantomas is the name of France 's glossy riposte to both James Bond and Batman . Modeled on a French fictional supercriminal , he is dedicated to evil rather than good deeds . Fantomas steals diamonds from Van Cleef &; Arpels , hijacks a gambling casino , terrorizes Paris and kidnaps blondes , all the while disguised as several law-abiding characters by means of " the most perfect artificial skin . " Beneath the masks lurks another mask , a bluish-grey rubbery face girdle that gives him the fiendish aspect of a dirty Mr. Clean . <P> For the foggiest of reasons , both Fantomas and the hot-shot Parisian journalist who seeks to undo him are played by Jean Marais . He has neither Batman 's flair nor James Bond 's cool , though he can easily look squarer than Superman . Passionate self-parody is Marais 's gimmick , and he earns a snicker whenever he detours into the arms of that demoiselle-in-distress , Mylne Demongeot , at one point with such fervency that he seems about to fling himself out of a rising helicopter . <P> Foolish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timed to go off just a split second too late , Fantomas ends up hors de combat . In its livelier moments , the picture is devoted to a chase involving runaway automobiles , crazy motorcycles , a freight train , a motor launch , a whirlybird , a miniature getaway submarine and an inflatable raft . Making such movies must be more fun than a picnic . Seeing them turns out to be less fun than the funny papers .
