Floyd McKissick , the new national director of CORE , stretched out on the bed in his room in Washington 's Sheraton-Park Hotel one evening last week and languidly shut his eyes-as if bored beyond all tolerance with the two white men earnestly pleading before him . <P> <P> " My God , " argued Baltimore 's Republican Mayor Theodore Roosevelt McKeldin , stretching his arms out emotionally , " I 've been fighting for the same thing CORE wants since 1927 . I 've sent open-occupancy legislation to our city council three times , and three times the Democrats have killed it . There are many things that need to be changed in our city , and you can help us . You can help me . " Taut , trim Major General George Gelston , Baltimore 's acting police commissioner , added his voice : " Look , I 've only been a policeman since April , and I 'm going to quit in September . All I want is to get the job done , and part of that job is maintaining the peace in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Baltimore , for all their pleading . Floyd McKissick was not interested in cooperation or McKeldin 's suggestion that he come to Baltimore the next day to talk with civic leaders . Baltimore has been selected as CORE 'S target city for the summer of 1966 , the demonstrations are in progress , and CORE is setting its own timetable and its own conditions . McKissick will talk to Baltimore leaders when he is ready . He had only one comment after they had gone . " Well , I 'm surprised , " he said . " You know , I really did n't think they 'd come . " <P> Aura of Hysteria . Winner in a covert internal coup that ousted longtime CORE Leader James Farmer last winter , McKissick , 44 , has lately steered his civil rights outfit , a leader in the movement in the ' 60s , away from gradual integration toward aggressive Desegregation Now . Almost all white members and most Negro moderates have either resigned or been nudged out of national policymaking positions . Opposition to the war in Viet Nam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to damning any cooperation with whites-as McKissick did during his meeting with the two Baltimore officials . <P> " Sometimes the pseudoliberal can become a monkey on your back , " McKissick tartly explained to Charlotte , N.C. , Reporter Dwayne Walls shortly before his election . " They have only a partial commitment , and they think in terms of the great progress the Negro has made instead of thinking of the great injustice . " <P> " Join the White Man ? " Farmer , 46 , who helped to found CORE on Gandhian principles of nonviolence in 1942 , is now denounced for not condemning the war in Viet Nam when he was director , and the entire range of U.S. foreign policy is seen as a plot against the non-white races . " Obviously , " says New York CORE Chairman Roy Innis , 31 , " the Pax America of Johnson refers to white people and the interests of white people , not the world that is mostly nonwhite.
