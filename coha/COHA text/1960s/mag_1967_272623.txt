Facing up to the question of how to finance expansion and maintain quality , the hard-pressed regents of the University of California last week rejected Governor Ronald Reagan 's plan to levy a tuition charge a year from now , then turned around to endorse an unspecified increase in student fees . As a result , both Reagan and his opponents among the regents could claim a moral victory-but it was also clear that tuition at the state university is still an extremely touchy issue in politically volatile California . <P> At a heated meeting in Los Angeles , Reagan initially proposed to charge an annual $250 tuition on top of the present student fees , which average $250 . <P> After some speakers had had their say , he finally demanded simply a vote on the basic issue . " I want a yea or nay vote on the principle of tuition , " he said . " I 'm against the hypocrisy of calling tuition something else . " Reagan 's motion was defeated 14 to 7 , but later the regents agreed , by voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new " fees " for next year to finance " student aid , faculty enrichment , and/or other uses " - apparently the same things that Reagan 's tuition charge was supposed to pay for . <P> The board 's action , summed up Regent William M. Roth , " is like keeping your virginity and having fun too . " <P> However ambiguous , the decision may enable Reagan , who pushed a big tax hike through the California legislature this year , to get by without seeking a further increase for university operations next year .
