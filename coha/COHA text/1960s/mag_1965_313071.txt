Nearing the end of its herculean first session , the 89th Congress has firmly set in place the foundations of the Great Society . It has adopted legislation that will affect nearly all Americans , but most immediately the poor , the elderly , the undereducated , those who are conspicuously deprived of political representation and economic opportunity . While thus proving itself the most liberal Congress in decades , the 89th has notably refused to act in one area that might have been expected to fit its pattern : it has not approved a single bill that would exclusively benefit organized labor . <P> At the start of the session , the A.F.L.-C.I.O. urgently requested enactment of a $2-an-hour minimum wage , a standard 35-hour work week and double pay for overtime . None of these proposals even came up for a vote . Last week the Senate made so bold as to reject the bill that union chiefs craved more than any other : repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act 's hated 14(b) , the " right to work " clause , under which 19 states have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olympian Ultimatum . It was not for lack of effort on labor 's part . Swarms of hard-bitten labor lobbyists bustled around Capitol Hill all session . A.F.L.-C.I.O . President George Meany himself stumped from office to office , making gruff demands for repeal . International Typographical Union President Elmer Brown even distributed copies of an Olympian ultimatum admonishing Congress : " Our patience is about exhausted with being doublecrossed . And the Senators ought to know that they can not doublecross the labor movement again and get away with it . " <P> Not so long ago , most U.S. politicians would have paid heed to such fulminations . After all , during the 1958 congressional elections many Republican candidates campaigned on the right-to-work issue , arguing that the union shop was undemocratic . It was a classic blunder . Labor rose up that year , dashed Republican after Republican down to defeat for supporting 14(b) , and changed the complexion of the U.S. Congress to a liberal hue that has not faded since . <P> Eroding Power . Nonetheless , the public prestige and political power of big labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinations of such union bosses as the Teamsters ' Dave Beck and Jimmy Hoffa have tarnished the image of the crusading labor leader . Admittedly , during the 1964 campaign , Lyndon Johnson valued union support sufficiently to commit himself to repeal of 14(b) . But , well aware that few Americans these days are impassioned over Taft-Hartley , the President did little to push his bill on Capitol Hill . <P> For labor , the moment of defeat approached last week , as Minority Leader Everett Dirksen 's anti-repeal filibuster droned into its sixth day . Though the House had voted for a repeal bill in July , and a majority of Senators ( at least 55 ) nominally opposed 14(b) for various reasons , sentiment on both sides was curiously muted . Several staunchly liberal newspapers actually opposed the bill . " There is much to be said for letting the states continue to experiment with varied statutes of their own , " editorialized the Washington Post , " at least until a national consensus emerges . " As of now , according to the Gallup poll , Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeal , 44% in favor .
