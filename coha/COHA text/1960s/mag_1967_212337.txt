Prince Mohamed ben Hussein , commander of the Royalist army , sat on a carpet spread in front of the mountain cave that has been his headquarters for most of Yemen 's five-year civil war . Before him were the turbaned chiefs of the country 's most powerful tribes , summoned for a council of war . At long last , announced Ben Hussein , his army was ready to launch a march on San'a - the final offensive , he hoped , that would retake the capital and finish off the Republican regime . <P> " We have money , " he told his guests , " and you will have your share if you join us . If not , we will go on without you . " The chiefs were eager to help , especially since the Republicans ' Egyptian defenders had been ordered home . They quickly agreed to mobilize their tribes , and to seal the agreement they devoured a great mound of lamb and rice proffered by the prince . Last week the Royalist siege of San'a began . <P> Out of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50,000 armed tribesmen known as " the Fighting Rifles . " Well trained ( by French mercenaries ) and well armed ( with recoilless rifles , heavy mortars and bazookas ) , they quickly surrounded San'a , captured its main airport and severed the Chinese-built highway to the port of Hodeida , which was not only the pride of the Republican regime but a main route for Russian supplies . <P> In one bloody battle twelve miles east of the capital , 3,200 soldiers of both sides were killed . The ferocity of the attack threw the 10,000-man Republican army into such confusion that an entire regiment reportedly deserted to the Royalists . With his artillery zeroing in on the outskirts of San'a , the prince sent an ultimatum : " Surrender the city or be annihilated . " <P> Bodies on Poles . Republican President Abdul Rahman Iryani 's only answer was to go off to Cairo for what Nasser 's official press agency described as " a medical checkup . " Foreign Minister Hassan Macky also left Yemen , showing up nearly a week early for an Arab foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab summit . That left the government in charge of Field Marshal Hassan al-Amri , the army commander . Al-Amri declared a 6 p.m. curfew , ordered civilians to form militia units " to defend the republic . " In Liberation Square , a howling mob watched a firing squad execute six suspected Royalist infiltrators , then dragged their bodies to the gates of the city and strung them up on poles . <P> By the week 's end the Republicans claimed to be holding their own , but their position was perilous . Even though it boasts Russian equipment-including a few MIG-19s-the Republican army is no match for the Royalists ' mountain tribesmen , who are the fiercest warriors in Yemen . Nor can the Republicans expect help from Nasser , whose last troops left in the middle of last week 's fighting . Although the Cairo newspaper Al Ahram charged that the CIA was behind the Royalists , the government made it plain that it considers the fighting essentially a " domestic Yemeni affair . " Thus , after years of stalemate , the Yemeni civil war appeared finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long managed to delay-but not to deny .
