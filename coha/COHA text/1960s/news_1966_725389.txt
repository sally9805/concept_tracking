txt " I quit . " Rare is the employe , whether a top-level executive or a trash collector , who has n't sometime said those fateful words  --  silently to himself . In today 's sunny business climate , however , a remarkably large number of people are saying " I quit " out loud  --  and to the boss . One boss who can testify that quitting is on the rise is the head of Atlanta 's sanitation department . In the past year , the department 's turnover rate has been a frenetic 400 " , eight times the 1963 rate , and a 4.5 ' ; ) pay boost on Jan. 1 has n't helped . The city has been forced to send convicts around to collect garbage . Prisoners with less than a year left to serve are used " so they wo n't he so likely to try to escape , " reports S. W. Graydon , Atlanta sanitary engineer . " Only about one a week " does manage to get away . Few employers , however , are so fortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left by departing employes . And there 's no doubt these job gaps are showing up more often . Federal statistics . show that , in manufacturing , the rate of " quits " in January , on a yearly basis , amounted to nearly 30% of employment ; this does not mean 30% of all manufacturing employes are quitting in the course of a year , because some of the quits represent job-hopping workers who change employment more than once annually . A year ago , the manufacturing quit rate was barely half the January level . For most bosses the sharp rise in quitting is proving to be an exceedingly costly matter . Often , the cost is plainly apparent . A Division President Quits A large manufacturer of recreational equipment reports it has recently suffered business losses because of the departure of key managers . The concern lost a division president , who quit last spring to take another job , and was unable to replace him until January . The man left at a critical time . The division had been in the middle of a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We put an interim man in but he had to cover his own job , too , " says a spokesman . " He just could n't cover all bases . " Result : " The division slipped from a marginal situation to a loss situation . " A big Chicago-based electronics maker was forced to delay the introduction of a new transistor radio for eight months because the man in charge of research and development for the radio quit to take a higher-paying job . And a large chemical company is still trying to replace its director of research for agricultural chemicals , who quit six months ago . The loss has " stymied " the company 's plans to increase its share of the agricultural chemical market , one source reports . Quitting by personnel who held less lofty positions also is proving costly for many organizations . Departed Drill-Press Operator Don Wiant , employment manager of Parker-Hannifin Co .. a Cleveland producer of power system components , tells of a 19-yearold who recently quit his job as a drill-press operator . " He was working in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was turning out hydraulic valves for earth-moving machinery ? an area where pressure to meet delivery schedules is very great . " To fill the gap left by the sudden departure  --  the man gave 10 minutes notice ? the company has been forced to pay overtime to other employes . " Any way you slice it . a thing like this costs us money , " Mr. Wiant says . Scripto , Inc. , the Atlanta maker of pens . pencils and cigaret lighters , reports all sorts ' of problems stemming from increased quitting by tool makers and other skilled workers . Carl N. Singer . president , says the loss of several highly skilled workers in December necessitated pulling a design engineer off his own job for two weeks to train new personnel . " That took the design engineer two weeks off his timetable in developing a new writing instrument for us , it delayed his whole staff of six people for two weeks , and in fact the whole project was slowed down . " Mr. Singer recalls . The Scripto executive adds that increased quitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher than a year ago , he says ? " also is causing a decline in a person 's pride in his work and performance , which affects both quality-control and output . " Mr. Singer says this decline necessitates " an added extra effort on management 's part to keep checking on things , and there 's no way to measure the added expense to a company in terms of costs . " " Sky-High " Salaries An aerospace company in Southern California has had great difficulty in the past year or so getting and keeping computer programmers . " Salaries seem to be shooting sky high , even for programmers with little experience  --  two years at most , " says the firm 's employment chief . Some of the personnel who have recently quit . he adds , were making as much as $800 a month , but were nevertheless lured away by offers of higher pay  --  in some instances , more than 30% above what they had been getting . This raiding has forced the California concern to boost many of its salaries sharply and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employers expect the problem of quitting to get worse in the months ahead , particularly if the war in Vietnam continues to intensify and esilses a further manpower squeeze . AI Sloan. manager of personnel administration for Collins Radio Co .. Dallas , reports resignations by Collins engineers and technical workers have climbed only about 2% in the past year . Rat he expects " further dif5culty " in the scanner , when children are out of school and moving is normally more convenient for families . Some personnel would quit now if they could but must wait a while because they are under contract . Recently four veterans of the 105-member Philadelphia Orchestra asked to be released from their contracts , which expire in September 1967 , to join the music department of the University of Washington at Seattle . But the orchestra is refusing to let them go until their contracts end . The quartet includes a first violinist with 23 years experience and a second violinist with 20 years . While the lure of fatter pay brought about by the generally brisk economic pace is certainly the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplemental explanations . " With assurancs of plenty of jobs , a person now can look for other things besides simply pay in his work , " declares L. W. Miller , vice president and personnel manager of Liberty National Bank &; Trust Co. , Oklahoma City . " People are looking for a means of expressing themselves through their jobs these days ; they 're looking for spiritual compensation . " Poverty-War Impact The Administration 's " war-on-poverty " program has brought a sharp rise in quitting by certain types of workers . Harold Rosen , personnel director for Santa Clara County in California , says many social workers have quit recently to join the Federal program . " Every public agency in California is looking for trained social workers , " Mr. Rosen says , " and the demand is perhaps 10 times the supply . " In Texas , the state legislature last year authorized jobs for 10 additional parole officers . But the openings have n't been filled yet . In fact , the state 's supply of parole officers has recently been declining . Seven officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on poverty , at considerable raises in pay , " says a state official . The war in Vietnam has triggered increased quitting in some fields where the type of work is similar to certain military jobs . U S. Lines and several other steamship companies report a recent rise in the number of men quitting to enlist in the Navy ( a man who is drafted , of course , is n't classified as a quit ) . In today 's affluence , some people are quitting their jobs simply because they find they no longer must work and would rather play . Roger Wagner , industrial relations director for Omark Industries , Inc. , a Portland . Ore. , maker of power-saw chains , recalls that recently " a woman production worker quit because , she said , she did n't have enough time to go ice skating . I was skeptical at the time . But I recently went ice skating with my family for the first time in 27 years and . sure enough , there was that woman at the rink . " The impact on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few rungs up on the corporate ladder , can reach well beyond the problem of replacing the employe . " The effect on other employes when a good man quits for what he believes are greener pastures can be a real headache . " says an employe supervisor of a large New York company . " The colleagues of the departing man start wondering if they 're standing on the dock while the boat pulls away ; and it does n't help matters when the ex-employe takes his old friends to lunch and boasts how well things are going for him at the new place . " To try to hang on to personnel , employers are turning to a variety of measures in addition to outright salary boosts . Antipirating Code C G Shaffer , personnel director for Frontier Airlines . Denver , reports the industry has set up an " unwritten code " to prevent intercompany raiding . " If a man walks in from Uneed Air Lines to talk about a job . I unmediatcly ask him for a letter of release from l'inted. " says Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll probably call United right then and tell them he 's talking to me . " In today 's tight labor market , however , " I still may hire him , but I let his employer know what 's going , at least , " the official adds . Et en when extra money is the chief method of trying to keep workers , the techniques often take uriisual forms . One large steamship company , for instance , recently has resorted to ' spec aldeals " to keep key shipboard men from departing for the Navy or other lines . In these arrangements , the firm pays the men it wants to retain about $100 a month more than their job category calls for . A r .. se In quitting is largely responsible for a recent decision by local government ofin the San Francisco area to ease restde ecy requirements for new employes . NonSan Francisco residents now can be hired to local-government jobs , if a resident ca n't he found . Previously , only residents could be ern plot cd. according to George J. Grubb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . Very occasionally , an organization is managing to hang on to personnel by doing nothg at all . Such is the case at the Manned Spacecraft Center of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration near Houston . " These people are dedicated to the space program , " says a NASA spokesman . " Many of them hat e taken salary reductions " to work at the center . He reports that " we 've had no management-level vacancies in a year and a half . "
