THE THEATER <P> Duel of Angels ( translated and adapted by Christopher Fry from the French of Jean Giraudoux ) was the last play written before his death in 1944 , by the wittily ironic , aromatically pessimistic author of The Madwoman of Chaillot and Tiger at the Gates . It is a suavely chill farewell -a glass of iced champagne held in almost as cold a hand . Called Pour Lucrece in French , it offers-in the Aix-en-Provence of 1868-variations on the old tale of the violated Roman matron who , after bidding her family avenge her , committed suicide . It opens in the best Giraudoux style of artificial high comedy . The ultra-pure wife of Aix 's overrighteous new judge , by cutting dead everyone involved in sexual intrigue , even the innocent , deceived mates , is rocking the town with scandal . When one decent husband 's eyes are opened , his affectionate if promiscuous wife harshly berates the prude . Then , drugging the virtuous lady , she plots with a procuress to make the lady believe that while unconscious she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucrce theme sounds louder chords , as the pure lady bids the rake kill himself only for him to be killed in a duel , as the righteous judge rejects the wife he thinks was raped and she takes poison , rejecting life itself , Giraudoux 's artificial story remains scrupulously behind glass . But gusts of realistic rain or melodramatic sleet from time to time beat against it . Giraudoux cleverly lets his characters remark how tragedy is jostling farce , or drama is encroaching on comedy . But the play , as it plunges over rapids in which both men and women are hurt , and virtue and vice are drowned , is kept between banks by an ironic tone and wit . By the end , the champagne seems more like Pernod , and the last word-a kind of lament for women by way of lashing out at men-goes significantly to the procuress . <P> In this duel of attitudes , the play 's blood thins as its plot thickens , and what the evening yields as a whole is not so much a sharp intellectual meaning as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Must sensuality grow so coarse , or purity so prudish , or life itself so punishing ? But if limited in vital substance , Duel of Angels has considerable style . Christopher Fry has conveyed Giraudoux 's gloved , sheathed , scented prose with great adroitness , and Roger Furse 's sets and Dior 's gowns enhance the provincially elegant atmosphere . If much of the acting is simply competent and Mary Ure in the difficult role of the pure woman suggests mere marble rather than flesh on which ice has formed , Vivien Leigh 's errant lady is conceivably the high point of her career .
