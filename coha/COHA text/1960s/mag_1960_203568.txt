Beneath tents and armory roofs , in airplane hangars and convention halls , U.S. industry 's managers gathered last week for their annual rites of spring : the yearly stockholders ' meeting . When the news was good-as it generally was-sunlight and flute music filled the scene , but when it was bad , there were squalls and sour notes . <P> Before some 11,000 expectant stockholders , American Telephone &; Telegraph President Frederick R. Kappel rose to applause for his fine 1959 and first-quarter 1960 earnings report ( TIME , April 18 ) . ? But when President Kappel explained what was on his mind , the cheers turned to groans . Contrary to all hopeful ' rumors , said Kappel , A.T . &; T. was not considering an immediate boost in the $3.30-per-share annual dividend . " The time since the dividend was last increased was very short-one year-and this is not a long enough period to tell us what we need to know about the future , which is very long indeed . " A.T . &; T. stock , which had hopped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped right back down again , slipped 4 ? points in a day and closed the week at 89 . <P> $2.6 Billion Expansion . What started the rumors of a bigger dividend ? Nothing more than a hope among Wall Streeters . They reasoned that since A.T . &; T. was in the best cash shape in years , it should be able to pass on a boost to stockholders . No such luck . President Kappel said that A.T . &; T. needs the cash for expansion . In 1960 , said he , A.T . &; T. plans to spend $2.6 billion on capital improvements , the largest sum ever . <P> For the bosses of dozens of other top U.S. companies , the greeting from stockholders depended not so much on additional goodies but on whether profits were up or down . Steelmen beamed as they presented quarterly reports posting new records for sales and earnings . Armco Steel was up to $1.62 per share v. $1.43 in last year 's first quarter ; Kaiser Steel zoomed from 76 to $1.79 per share ; both Republic Steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first of the automakers to report , Ford Motor Co. foretold good news from Detroit with first-quarter earnings of $2.61 per share , up 6% from last year . Chrysler was also doing better , although there were troubles ( see next page ) . <P> Irate Stockholders . But it was a dark day for Douglas Aircraft 's Donald Douglas Sr. , who had to suffer through a 2-hour meeting and shouts of " baloney " after announcing " an extremely disappointing " $6,949,002 loss for the quarter , due mostly to extra-heavy development expenses on the DC-8 jetliner program . At Columbia Broadcasting System , Chairman William S. Paley had an unruly meeting on his hands , with irate stockholders complaining over lower earnings ( slightly less than 1959 's 87 for the first quarter ) , the payola TV scandals and a handful of other problems . Said Chairman Paley : " We used to look forward to these meetings . Now we anticipate them with dread . " <P> Nevertheless , across the wide spectrum of U.S. industry , the first quarter of 1960 produced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share ) :
