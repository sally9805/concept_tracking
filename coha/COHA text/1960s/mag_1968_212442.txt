Norman Mailer put his money where his mouth is and turned out a movie he claims " has the most repetitive , pervasive obscenity of any film ever made . " He may well be right , but it is rather hard to tell . Much of Wild 90 is utterly unintelligible , with a partially overloaded sound track and a thoroughly overloaded cast of characters who are barely able to get their thick tongues around the four-letter words . <P> The caper began last winter , when Mailer 's play The Deer Park was running off-Broadway . Mailer and a few of the actors got into the habit of boozing together in a Greenwich Village restaurant after performances . As boys will , they fell into a game of let 's pretend . They pretended they were Sicilian gangsters , and they gave themselves names-Cameo , Twenty Years , The Prince ( Mailer , of course ) - and they talked tough and dirty at each other night after night . It was all such fun that Mailer laid out $1,500 , moved his make-believe Mafiosos into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistols and plenty of liquor , and in four consecutive nights shot 2 hours of 16-mm. film that was eventually cut to 90 minutes . <P> In Wild 90 Mailer , with Buzz Farbar and Mickey Knox-both of whom are real actors-pretend they have been holed up together for days . They yell at each other and chain-drink . The camera stays mostly on Mailer , who goes " Unhh ! Unhh ! " a lot while he is thinking up dirty words . People come and go . One is a prizefighter ( Jos Torres ) with a German shepherd . Norman has a protracted barking contest with the dog , and spars a round with Torres , demonstrating the killer-wombat style with which he has enlivened so many Manhattan parties . Toward the end , two broads arrive-one of them Beverly Bentley , the current Mrs. Mailer . She hands him a knife a couple of times , but nothing comes of it . After a while the money runs out , and the home movie just stops .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
