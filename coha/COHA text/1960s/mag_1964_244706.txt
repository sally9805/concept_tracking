We must give to all Americans , those on the farms and those in the cities , a chance to drink from the cup of plenty . I just came from visiting a home that has used the food stamp plan , that lives off an old-age pension that tries to feed a grandmother , seven children , a mother and father-a family of ten-off nine acres of tobacco and ten acres of cotton on an advance of $20 a week with a charge of 10% interest . <P> - President Johnson in Rocky Mount , N.C. , May 7 , 1964 <P> The President , once a poor boy himself , really feels deeply about poverty . But he is also striding high with it as a political issue , and last week he got tripped up . <P> A couple of Republican Congressmen , Nebraska 's David Martin and Kentucky 's Gene Snyder , journeyed South and returned with a tale of dire poverty in Lyndon 's own backyard-or , more precisely , Lady Bird 's . In Alabama 's Autauga County , Lady Bird owns about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Much of the land , once cotton-producing , has been turned to timber , but four Negro tenant families still live on some of the property , occupying rundown houses that do more than Lyndon Johnson 's words to dramatize poverty . <P> If They Cared ? " We were shocked at the squalor we found , " reported the Congressmen when they returned with a telling set of photographs . The tenants are " living in deplorable poverty with little evidence of concern by their millionaire landlords . " Said Snyder : " We found tenants living in three-and four-room shacks with cracks in the flooring , leaking roofs , broken wood-burning cook stoves , some at least 50 years old , and no toilet facilities . " Said Martin : " If I owned property like that , I 'd feel it a moral obligation to make it comfortable and adequate . At least so the roof does n't leak every time it rains , so the water does n't fall on the bed . " <P> Added Snyder : " We saw nothing here that could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nickel of federal funds or a single federal program-if , of course , they really cared . " <P> Among Lady Bird 's tenants , said Martin and Snyder , were Charles Cutler , 75 , and his wife Willie . They pay Lady Bird $5 a month for a four-room house and an old barn on four acres , and have a cash income from public welfare of $150 a month . " We have lived here for 50 years , " said Mrs. Cutler . " We like it . I want to stay here until the good Lord takes me away . But I do wish that Mrs. Johnson would fix the roof . This old house leaks bad . " <P> Making It Possible . While newsmen flocked to Autauga County to see for themselves , Lady Bird 's press secretary , Elizabeth Carpenter , hastily explained the Johnson side of the story . It seemed that Lady Bird actually wanted to turn all of her land to timber , but expressly instructed her overseer to permit the old tenants on the land to stay as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very elderly and have no place to go , " said Mrs. Carpenter . " They want to stay there . She is really making it possible for them to live out their days at $5 a month , and she sends them boxes of clothes . " <P> Sure enough , Farmer Cutler showed newsmen three tailor-made suits that Lyndon had sent him . " They makes me feel just like I 'm a Senator myself , " he chuckled .
