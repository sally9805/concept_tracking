A state-by-state presidential countdown , as reported by TIME correspondents ten days before election . <P> <P> Alabama ( 10 electoral votes ) : Lyndon Johnson 's name is not even on the ballot . A cinch for Goldwater . <P> Alaska ( 3 ) : The state 's economy is based on federal spending , and Alaskans are banking on help from Washington to rebuild after last March 's earthquake . Given Goldwater 's dim view of big federal spending , a Johnson victory . <P> Arizona ( 5 ) : Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 325,000 to 180,000 , and Goldwater will need help from a strong state ticket to carry his own state . <P> Arkansas ( 6 ) : The state G.O.P. organization is run by Gubernatorial Candidate Winthrop Rockefeller , who scrupulously avoids mentioning Barry 's name in public . There is strong segregationist sentiment , but Johnson is narrowly favored . <P> California ( 40 ) : Despite saturation TV exposure and hordes of tireless volunteer workers , polls show that Goldwater is way behind . Democrats have signed up seven new voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead in total registration . For Lyndon . <P> Colorado ( 6 ) : This was solid Goldwater country until the campaign began in earnest . Then a split in the state G.O.P. and Barry 's speeches on social security and nuclear control softened it up for Johnson , who now leads . <P> Connecticut ( 8 ) : A landslide for Johnson . <P> Delaware ( 3 ) : Easily Lyndon 's . <P> <P> District of Columbia ( 3 ) : With a 50% Negro vote , Johnson is an overwhelming favorite to win when Washington residents cast their first presidential ballot . <P> Florida ( 14 ) : Goldwater looked like an easy winner . Then he criticized social security in a state full of retired people , derided the moon race despite heavy U.S. space-spending in Florida . Democratic Senator Spessard Holland , up for reelection , is working hard for Johnson . That , plus a 283,000 Negro registration , up 115,000 from 1960 , should give L.B.J. a slim lead . <P> Georgia ( 12 ) : The Jenkins case cut hard in Georgia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson , and Georgia has never failed to go Democratic . Unless too many apathetic voters stay home , Johnson should eke out a win . <P> Hawaii ( 4 ) : A tidal wave for L.B.J. <P> Idako ( 4 ) : The G.O.P. is split , and a great deal of normally Republican business and newspaper support has come to Johnson , who has a slight edge . <P> Illinois ( 26 ) : Goldwater named Illinois as a state he had to have " to win this thing , " but his campaign , hurt by his stances on farm supports and nuclear control , has steadily deteriorated , and some observers now place Johnson 's margin at more than 500,000 , which could spell disaster for Republican Gubernatorial Candidate Charles Percy . <P> Indiana ( 13 ) : This is Peggy Goldwater 's home state , and it is usually staunchly Republican in presidential elections . But Goldwater , hindered by a sparkless G.O.P. organization and by his own campaign , now seems to be trailing in a tight race . <P> <P> Iowa ( 9 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like his views on social security . Johnson is well ahead . <P> Kansas ( 7 ) : Another Republican stronghold now leaning to Lyndon.
