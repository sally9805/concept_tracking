In Indiana , almost everybody knows by now , the basketball season does not end in March , as it does elsewhere . Indeed , nothing really important happens in the sport until June , when Hoosiers from Elkhart to Evansville get the opportunity to prove theirs is the best basketball state in the Republic . From 1940 to 1955 there was little reason to dispute the claim as Indiana consistently defeated the second best state , Kentucky , in the annual high school All-Star games . // Then strange things began to happen . Kentucky , struggling for its reputation , got rid of its college coaches  --  who had tended to turn the game into a showcase for the players they had recruited for their own schools  --  and at the same time began playing Negroes . Soon , Kentucky was holding its own . In 1965 and 1966 Kentucky won four straight games . ( There are two each June . ) So Indiana turned around and made some changes of its own . Instead of picking its All-Stars by statewide vote of sportswriters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indiana 's game director , Fred Corts , and Coach Cleon Reynolds , hand-picked the squad . The panel made sure there were no oddball characters included like Marv Winkler ( SI , June 27 , 1966 ) to complicate the task . And when the team assembled on June 7 in Indianapolis the coaches isolated the players from the inevitable tumult and shouting and extracurricular stuffing at dairy bars . // Kentucky , still trailing in the series 23 games to 14 , was n't about to take matters lightly , however . In Louisville , Coach Don Morris held secret practice sessions , made sure everybody up north knew that his Jim McDaniels was an honest 7 feet tall ( " He 's really only 6 ' 11 ? " barefoot , " Morris later admitted ) and brought along three assistants , one to help coach and two to chart everything from defensive rebounds to the number of times a Kentucky player visited the water cooler . // McDaniels , probably the best high school player in the country , was the main attraction in both camps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before last week . Kentucky used him as its chief weapon in the pregame psychological warfare . His statistics , 38.6 points and 25 rebounds per game , plus that elongated frame , seven inches of which he had acquired in the past 24 months , were frightening enough . But there was more , much more . // " I must have received 300 clippings on that boy since December , " Indiana 's Reynolds said . Fourteen of the best were tacked on the wall of the Indiana Central College gym , where the Hoosiers worked out , with phrases like " best player in the country " and " unstoppable " underlined in blood-red ink . And the final touch was a rumor spread by Kentuckians that the Boston Celtics had offered McDaniels a $100,000 bonus to turn pro right now , maybe because he had grown himself a Bill Russell goatee. // There were other Kentuckians , of course , especially Clarence Glover , a 6 ' 8 " center who was beating McDaniels consistently in practice , and Jim Rose , a four-time all-stater . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kentucky starting this fall . In fact , of the 11 Kentucky All-Stars , five signed with Western 's Johnny Oldham , and as a final affront to the University of Kentucky 's Adolph Rupp , who once had a corner on everybody in the Bluegrass , even the team manager is going to Western . // To counter McDaniels ' scary reputation , Reynolds first saw to it that three centers were named to his All-Stars instead of the expected two . " I 'm afraid he 'll run over our first two boys , " he said . Then he signed on Hallie Bryant as an assistant and made Gregg Northing-ton , a 6 ' 10 ? " center , Bryant 's special project . Bryant was " Mr. Basketball " in Indiana in 1953 and has been with the Harlem Globetrotters for eight years . A week before the Hoosier team assembled he began working on Northington , trying to instill in him the idea he could hold his own with McDaniels . It was n't an easy job , but Bryant had an advantage over a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Indianapolis , Northington attended Wood and both are located in Negro ghettos . Bryant could at least talk to Northington , by nature a reticent kid . " Do n't let that fool you , " Bryant said . " Basketball 's the only thing Gregg 's ever had . When you grow up in a place like he did , you learn to shield yourself . " // It seemed obvious that if Indiana was to have any chance at all , it depended on Northington 's ability to do something with McDaniels . With Bryant 's help , Northington quietly got ready , and the night before the game he even showed a bit of emotion . When McDaniels was introduced at a banquet Northington looked up and bit his ever-present toothpick in half . // Reynolds , though , was n't convinced . " If you 've got a 6 ' 10 " boy you 've got to use him , " he said . " He does n't do you any good sitting on the bench . But , man , he did n't learn anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around with his hands in the air . When he jumps he does n't get more than an inch off the ground . When you do n't jump against somebody like McDaniels you eat leather . I just hope McDaniels has a bad night and we can hold him to 28 points or so and stop the rest of ' em . " // McDaniels , meanwhile , took all the uproar he had caused with admirable calm . The night before the game he told Kentucky 's Morris , " If you want to use me as a decoy it 's all right . I 'll go scoreless if it will help us beat Indiana . " // McDaniels almost did go scoreless . The 14,565 fans who jammed themselves inside Butler University 's Hinkle Field-house waving scorecard-fans like a convention of butterflies to combat the end of a massive Midwest heat wave expected to see the traditional duel of the big men . McDaniels and Northington definitely had a duel , but it was n't very traditional , and it was not at all what anyone expected . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed by both teams saw to that  --  but instead of a high-scoring , high-rebounding free-for-all , what took place was more like a street brawl . When they were on the court together they spent their time clawing and scratching at each other with complete disdain for the rule book . It got so bad that at one point the referees had to warn them to cut out the wrestling . // The game itself was a bit of an anticlimax . Both teams were obviously tense and nervous and their play reflected it . Kentucky shot just 40% from the floor and Indiana was worse with 32% . More important , while McDaniels and Northington carried on their own private war , Kentucky came up with two little men , Rose and Glenn Montgomery , 6 ' 3 " and 6 ' 1 " respectively , who hit superbly from the outside and threatened several times to make a rout of the whole affair . Rose , working from the left side , shot consistently while the defense sagged . He utilized his picks and screens well or drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorer with 25 points to lead Kentucky 's decisive 79-67 win . Kentucky never trailed after a three-point play by Rose put it ahead early in the first half . // Until the last seven minutes , in fact , no big man really distinguished himself . Glover fouled out with 14 minutes remaining and just two points to his credit ; McDaniels followed seven minutes later with two field goals and seven points after sitting out most of the second half because he had four fouls . With those two out of the way , Northington finally went to work offensively . In the space of five minutes he hit five field goals in seven attempts and nearly rallied Indiana to a victory all by himself . Twice the Hoosiers came to within six points in the final minutes after trailing by as many as 14 early in the half , but on both occasions Rose or Montgomery or somebody picked up a field goal here , a three-point play there , to keep Indiana dangling . // Before the game Reynolds , who was twice the losing coach in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win Saturday there may be a rope hanging from the top of the field house after the game  --  with me at the end of it . " // That , of course , did n't happen , but this Saturday it 's a good bet Reynolds will cast a wary eye toward the rafters of Louisville 's Freedom Hall when the second game begins .
