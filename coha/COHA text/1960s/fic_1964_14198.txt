Scene : The combination office-living room of CHARLES TANEY 'S apartment on the second floor of a charming house in the East Sixties . The house is the headquarters of the Seymour Rosenthal Foundation . The first two floors are occupied by CHARLES TANEY , the Director of the Foundation ; the three upper floors by SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL . At right is a door to a staircase leading up to ROSENTHAL 'S quarters . Visible above is one of ROSENTHAL 'S rooms , a study ; in it we see a table with a telephone on it , a chair with a goose-necked lamp leaning over it , one of his pictures on a wall , and a door leading to another room . The impression given by SEYMOUR 'S room , in contrast with the office-living room below , is one of austerity . CHARLIE 'S office-living room is very cozy and comfortable  --  full of avant-garde pictures , tables loaded with manuscripts , galleys , submissions for consideration . Time : It is about six o'clock on an April afternoon . At Rise : NAOMI SAUNDERS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overburdened table , preparatory to departing , as her working day is over . MISS SAUNDERS is thirty , attractive and hep . She is slick ; there are no flies on MISS SAUNDERS . Just as she is leaving , with a sigh of relief , SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL wanders in . He gives the impression of having come from no place in particular and to be not quite certain of where he is going . He carries a bulging brief case . SEYMOUR is about thirty-five , dark , slim , gentle , beginning to get bald . His manner is hesitating ; he is nearsighted and has an anxious , somewhat pained , inquiring look . There is the faintest suggestion of a stammer in his speech ; you can not quite tell whether it is a stammer or whether he is merely inarticulate . He starts sentences and does n't finish them , as if he were assailed midway by doubts about the validity of what he is saying . MISS SAUNDERS , who is just about to leave , tries to suppress the annoyance she feels at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , good evening , Mr. Rosenthal. p. 3 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Oh , Miss Saunders . How are you ? NAOMI SAUNDERS Just leaving SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Is Mr. Taney about ? NAOMI SAUNDERS ( Who knows perfectly well ) I really do n't know . You know Mr. Taney ! He 's here and then he 's not here . ( During this , SEYMOUR has gone to the manuscript-piled table and begun looking through the scripts ) Anything I can do for you , Mr. Rosenthal ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Those poems  --  by that Irish girl I seem to have But do n't you bother , Miss Saunders you 're always working overtime as it is NAOMI SAUNDERS Sheila Maloney 's ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Yes . I know I took them Has Mr. Taney read them ? NAOMI SAUNDERS ( With contempt for SHEILA MALONEY ) I think he tried ! SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL She 's difficult special vocabulary but I think she 's worth ( By this time his search is becoming a little frantic ) NAOMI SAUNDERS ( Her contempt transferring itself subtly to SEYMOUR ) Have you tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opens his brief case , which SEYMOUR has left on a chair , riffles through it expertly and extracts a manuscript ) Here they are ! ( Reads from first page ) Poems  --  Sheila Maloney. p. 4 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Relieved and abashed ) Oh , thank you , Miss Saunders . You are really very and I am NAOMI SAUNDERS ( With irony ) You have so much on your mind , Mr. Rosenthal ! Anything else ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Oh , no . Thank you very much , Miss Saunders . NAOMI SAUNDERS Not at all . Good night . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Scribbles on a pad on the table ) Good night , Miss Saunders . I 'll just leave a note for Mr. Taney  --  to call me  --  when he comes in  --  ( MISS SAUNDERS goes . SEYMOUR props the note up against the telephone so it will be visible , takes SHEILA MALONEY 'S poems , stuffs them back into his brief case and walks slowly up the stairs . We see him go into his room , put his brief case on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light the lamp , take out the poems again , put on reading glasses , which he takes from the table , and start reading . The telephone rings downstairs . ANNA , a wispy , fast-moving , vitally energetic maid in her early forties , famous in CHARLIE 'S circle for her cooking and for her asperities , comes almost running in , as is her habit , to answer the telephone ) p. 5 ANNA ( On the telephone ) I 'm sorry Mr. Taney 's not in Yes , this is Anna  --  who 're you ? Oh , Doctor Greer oh well , if it 's you , Doctor Greer , I guess I can tell you  --  Mr. Taney is in but he asked me not to disturb him I ca n't disturb him if you know what I mean ( ANNA giggles hysterically ) Oh well , if he called you I guess he 'll ( At this point CHARLES TANEY comes in . CHARLES is thirty-five , very good-looking , smartly dressed , radiant with health , bounding vitality and delight in living ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To CHARLIE ) It 's Doctor Greer CHARLES TANEY Oh sure ( She hands over receiver ) CHARLES TANEY ( On the phone ) Hello Alvin ? ANNA ( As she goes ) I 'd like to speak to you about something , Mr. Taney , when you get through CHARLES TANEY ( Smiles at her ) Sure , pet . I 'll only be a minute ( ANNA goes out . CHARLIE resumes on the telephone ) Oh , well enough , learned Doctor Oh , just at the minute a bit down , but I 'll get over that Oh , you know ( His gaiety belies it ) Post coitum melancholia do n't you know I majored in classics at Yale ? I was going to call you , as a matter of fact How was the big meeting with Rosenthal ? I 'm agog to know What ? He did n't Well , the cowardly I 'm not surprised actually even back at Yale he was always making dates with psychoanalysts and breaking them at the last minute gets into a kind of funk about it or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway , Alvin , do n't worry , I 'll get him to you hell , I go to you and I 'm better adjusted than you are as Seymour is my lord and master I want him to be in good mental health but , Alvin , an awful thought just hit me if Seymour were in good mental health maybe he 'd give up this noble altruistic Foundation and I 'd be out of a job can I afford to get him to you ? What ? I want you to make him independent  --  but not of me . ( Evidently Doctor Greer is laughing . So is CHARLIE ) O.K. , Alvin . Leave it to me . ( Looks at the pad on the desk ) Oh , sure . Fourthirty Friday  --  I 'll be there  --  I 'm in no funk about seeing you , Alvin  --  in fact , it gives me a sense of superiority  --  I know so much more about life than you do . Okey-doke . ( He hangs up . The laughs he has gotten from his doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette and goes to the door through which he has come out , opens it a little , then he calls ) Faith ? O.K. ? p. 6 FAITH PROSPER O.K. Be out in a minute . CHARLES TANEY I 'll have a martini for you . ( He closes door , goes to bar and starts mixing drinks . While he is doing this ANNA comes back ) Anna , my precious , what 's on your mind ? ANNA Plenty . CHARLES TANEY ( Concerned  --  she is so grim ) What is it , Anna ? ANNA ( Bluntly ) I 'm quitting . ( CHARLIE is aghast . This is devastating . He puts down the cocktail mixer , walks to her ) CHARLES TANEY You 're not serious ! ANNA Got to ! CHARLES TANEY But , Anna ! Is anything wrong ? I adore you . I always thought you were happy here . Are n't you ? ANNA I 'm happy enough with you , but my doctor ai n't . CHARLES TANEY What ? ANNA Yes . I 've been going for four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . He says on account of you and the way you live and all that , I 've got sexual inferiority . CHARLES TANEY I never heard of anything so absurd . p. 7 ANNA ( With finality ) Doctor 's orders . CHARLES TANEY Change your doctor . ANNA My doctor 's God to me . CHARLES TANEY ( Pitifully ) You do n't know what you 're doing to me , Anna . I just ca n't imagine life without you . My popularity depends entirely on you . Why do my friends love me ? Because they love your cooking . Anna  --  I implore you  --  do n't desert me . ANNA ( With a certain hostility ) Oh , you 'll manage . Nothing 'll stop you ! CHARLES TANEY ( Sinks to his knees before her , his palms together in supplication ) Anna  --  I beg you ( FAITH comes in from the bedroom . She is a lovely girl of twenty-four ) FAITH PROSPER Hello , Anna . Charlie making love to you ? ANNA ( Throws her a look of aversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! Faith begs you ! ANNA ( Curtly ) Sorry . Doctor 's orders . The fifteenth I leave . I 'll be glad to break anybody in . ( She starts out . CHARLIE stands up ) p. 8 CHARLES TANEY ( Desperate ) Anna ! Wait a minute . ANNA ( Doggedly ) No use . I 've got another job ! CHARLES TANEY ( Aghast  --  this is the death knell ) You have ? ANNA My next boss is going to be a lady ! ( She goes out ) CHARLES TANEY ( Limp ) I 'll be God damned ! These psychoanalysts are a menace ! FAITH PROSPER What have they got to do with it ? CHARLES TANEY Her psychoanalyst told her I 'm not right for her . FAITH PROSPER ( Laughs ) Really ? CHARLES TANEY I 'm glad you think it 's funny . I 'm bruised . And you think it 's funny ! FAITH PROSPER I certainly do . Where 's that martini ? ( CHARLIE returns to the bar ) CHARLES TANEY In ten years  --  in ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't asked if she can come in late two mornings a week because she has to go to her analyst . God damn it , why do people take their egos so seriously ? ( He gives FAITH her drink , goes back to his own ) p. 9 FAITH PROSPER People are lonely . They want reassurance  --  they ( Struck by an idea ) Can it be that poor Anna is in love with you and ca n't stand the procession of girls that troop in and out of here  --  of which I am one ? CHARLES TANEY How idiotic can you get ! FAITH PROSPER You 'd be surprised ! CHARLES TANEY ( His gaiety returning ) I do n't believe in testing people for loyalty  --  or for anything else  --  still it will be interesting to see how many people will drop me  --  once Anna 's gone . ( He catches sight of SEYMOUR 'S note , glances at it , tosses it back on the table . A moment . FAITH gathers her strength to make a request ) FAITH PROSPER I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind ? CHARLES TANEY Not at all . Why should I mind ? I like Willard . How 's he getting along ? FAITH PROSPER I 'm desperate about him . CHARLES TANEY I 'm sorry to hear that . FAITH PROSPER He 's got that wretched part-time job in the book store . Between us we have three children to support  --  my dead brother 's children  --  and their mother . That walk-on I 've got in Father 's play does n't pay much  --  p. 10 CHARLES TANEY I 'll be glad to help  --  to tide Willard over  --  FAITH PROSPER I know how kind and generous you are . But it is n't a question of a loan . No matter what you lent him it 'd be only a stopgap . But you could do something that really would help him . That would encourage him , give him a new lease on life . A grant . A grant from the Seymour Rosenthal Foundation . CHARLES TANEY Well  --  a grant for what  --  for what project ? FAITH PROSPER ( Passionately ) It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't ask you if he did n't deserve it . But Willard 's a first-rate scholar . Even Father was proud of him . CHARLES TANEY What project ? FAITH PROSPER Willard 's writing a biography of Chamfort . CHARLES TANEY Who he ? FAITH PROSPER He was a figure of some prominence in the French Revolution . CHARLES TANEY Just what we need ! FAITH PROSPER Is n't the purpose of Seymour 's foundation to publish books that no one else will publish ? CHARLES TANEY ( Gently ) Yes , ostensibly , but it would help if the book had some other qualifications . p. 11 FAITH PROSPER I 've seen the part that Will 's done and it 's fascinating . CHARLES TANEY Why does n't he finish it ? FAITH PROSPER By the time he gets through wrapping bundles in the book shop , he 's too tired and discouraged to CHARLES TANEY He had a teaching job at NYU , did n't he ? Why did he give that up ? FAITH PROSPER I guess you know that too ! CHARLES TANEY ( Gently ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passionate defense ) Is it any wonder he drinks ? It 's a wonder he 's alive ! CHARLES TANEY You 're his sister . You 've been through about the same as Willard and yet you 're alive . Very much alive . FAITH PROSPER I insist on living ! I wo n't die . It would give her too much satisfaction . CHARLES TANEY You 're wrong about Gilian . Can you imagine what it was to be married to your father ? FAITH PROSPER I adore you , Charlie . But there 's one thing about you that crucifies me  --  that you like Gilian  --  that you see Gilian. p. 12 CHARLES TANEY You 're unfair to Gilian . FAITH PROSPER I get the feeling sometimes  --  CHARLES TANEY Yes ? FAITH PROSPER That you 'll end up with Gilian  --  that you mean to marry Gilian . CHARLES TANEY Gilian , you know , has a mind of her own  --  a very calculating one . I assure you  --  I 'd be no match for Gilian . FAITH PROSPER When Willard was a little boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous father never came to see him , and Willard had to lie to cover up . To all the litters of children Father left by various wives , he was invisible . When that play came out  --  telling what poor Dad had had to suffer from his parents and what a vampire Mother was  --  Willard said  --  he was seven years old then and he adored Mother  --  he said : " When I grow up I 'll kill my father . " That was his first articulate ambition ! CHARLES TANEY Why do you blame all that on Gilian ? FAITH PROSPER My mother , who saw Father through his years of struggle , died in poverty . Gilian came in for the kill . She sits in the lap of luxury . She has everything . ( A silence ) They should be sterilized , all of them p. 13 CHARLES TANEY Who ? FAITH PROSPER ( With irony ) These men of genius  --  they should be sterilized so they ca n't have children . CHARLES TANEY ( Flippantly ) Difficult to do that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't make fun of me , Charlie ! CHARLES TANEY Have another martini , darling . You 're overwrought ! ( He gives her another drink . She calms down a bit ) With all that you can say against your father , think of the magnificent works he left FAITH PROSPER I wish he had n't left us ! CHARLES TANEY If not for what they do  --  the artists  --  life would n't be worth living . You 'll admit that , wo n't you ? FAITH PROSPER If you happen to be their children the price of those masterpieces comes too high ! ( She picks up one of her father 's books from the table ) " To my dear Charlie , but for whom " ( She drops the book ) I know this book is a masterpiece but I loathe the sight of it . ( Upstairs we see SEYMOUR , lost in a dream of meditation over SHEILA MALONEY 'S verses . He lets the manuscript drop into his lap . His hand , almost unconsciously , moves to the button on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buzz in CHARLIE 'S room . CHARLIE walks to answer it ) p. 14 CHARLES TANEY ( On the telephone ) Seymour , my delinquent boy , how are you ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Oh , Charlie I left you a note to call me when you got in CHARLES TANEY Did you ? Where is it ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Oh  --  it does n't matter I thought  --  if you 're not busy I 'd like I 'd just like CHARLES TANEY What 's on your mind ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL These poems Sheila Maloney 's the more I read her CHARLES TANEY ( Incredulous ) Are you reading her ? How ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Well , yes , she 's difficult but there is she has well , tremendous passion there purity of feeling I ca n't except I find it very moving she reminds me she makes me think of Simone Weill CHARLES TANEY ( Winks at FAITH , who is listening attentively ) Why do n't we publish Simone Weil ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Dead serious ) Well , I 'm afraid she 's dead and we can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's alive . p. 15 CHARLES TANEY Why does she break out so much in Italian and Spanish ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL They 're the saints . She is absorbed in sainthood . She is a Catholic , I suppose . CHARLES TANEY ( Knowing he never will ) Well , I 'll have another go at Sheila . But I 've got something more immediate to talk to you about , my beamish boy . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Shrinking from the admonition ) What about ? CHARLES TANEY Doctor Greer called . He says you broke your appointment with him that was naughty of you it took some doing to get you that appointment he 's a very busy man , you know . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I just I do n't know at the last minute I just CHARLES TANEY I know the feeling though I never had it I never care what Alvin asks me I do n't even mind if I tell him the truth ( He laughs ) Faith Prosper 's with me like to come down ? She wants very much to meet you . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just this minute I have n't finished I have n't quite finished p. 16 CHARLES TANEY Okay . Stick with Sheila and the saints . I 'll call you later . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Please . Please do . I 'm not going out . ( He hangs up . Picks up the manuscript again . Sits a moment . Then he goes into the other room where , presumably , he tries to resolve the emotions induced by SHEILA by playing Bach . Intermittently , during the following scenes , we hear Bach 's Fantasia and Fugue . By this time FAITH , having finished her martini , is in better spirits ) CHARLES TANEY Sweet guy  --  Seymour  --  but no guts . Can you imagine  --  afraid to go to an analyst ! FAITH PROSPER Why are you so anxious for him to go ? CHARLES TANEY Because he needs it . He lacks self-confidence . FAITH PROSPER You are a darling . No wonder everybody loves you . CHARLES TANEY He 's so nave  --  Seymour . He does amuse me with his intensely serious ethical considerations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's what people love about you . Including yours truly . CHARLES TANEY Do you know why everything is funny to me , darling ? Because everything is funny . p. 17 FAITH PROSPER Perhaps you do n't feel anything very much ? CHARLES TANEY ( Lightly , just saying the easy thing ) You ca n't say that . You know how I feel about you , for instance . FAITH PROSPER That 's precisely what I do n't know ! CHARLES TANEY Good ! That 'll stimulate you ! FAITH PROSPER ( A moment ) By the way , Charlie  --  CHARLES TANEY What 's by the way ? FAITH PROSPER I 've had an offer of marriage . CHARLES TANEY Have you ? Anyone I know ? FAITH PROSPER Not remotely . CHARLES TANEY Then he ca n't be eligible ! ( FAITH laughs ) FAITH PROSPER You 're a terrible snob , I 'm afraid . CHARLES TANEY Who is he ? FAITH PROSPER He 's a bassoonist . CHARLES TANEY Where does he bassoon ? FAITH PROSPER He is a non-playing bassoonist . CHARLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PROSPER He 's in the orchestra in the play I 'm in . CHARLES TANEY But I do n't remember any music in your father 's play . FAITH PROSPER There is n't . The union insists he sit there every night with four other non-players . He 's a featherbedder . CHARLES TANEY ( Murmurs ) Are n't we all ? But you 'd better move cautiously , darling  --  about marrying him I mean  --  he may play at home when the union is n't looking . FAITH PROSPER I 'm very taken with him . He 's very endearing . I have a feeling if he knew about us  --  about me and my family , I mean  --  he 'd be scared to death to get involved with me . He 's very respectable . CHARLES TANEY You mean that you are concealing from him the awful intelligence that your father was a Nobel Prize winner ? FAITH PROSPER Oh , I think he must know that . It does n't impress him at all . CHARLES TANEY Is n't he a reader ? FAITH PROSPER Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lightly ) Are you having an affair with him ? ( She laughs ) Is the idea funny to you ? p. 19 FAITH PROSPER He has n't even kissed me yet . I know he wants to , but he does n't dare . You see , darling , he 's romantic about me . Willard says to grab him . Get as far away as you can , he says , from that literary crowd . When they 're written out  --  as Father got to be  --  they revenge themselves on everyone around them . They murder right and left just to prove to themselves that they 're not dead . CHARLES TANEY Are there no alternatives but bassoonists ? FAITH PROSPER I 'm not really thinking seriously of marrying my featherbedder . I only told you about it CHARLES TANEY Well ? FAITH PROSPER To see if it might produce a counter-offer . CHARLES TANEY I do adore you , darling . FAITH PROSPER ( Wryly ) I know you do . Why not ? CHARLES TANEY I do n't know anyone more enchanting . FAITH PROSPER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a wedding ring  --  though God knows that would be welcome because I love to be with you  --  but what I really want  --  and I want it terribly  --  is this grant for my brother . CHARLES TANEY ( With a weary sigh , points to the heaped-up pile of manuscripts and galleys on his table ) Requests . Works in progress . Manuscripts . Galleys . Projects . Novels . Poems . Works on philosophy , on cultural history , biographies , Ph.D . theses , ambitions to blossom into books . The yearnings of mid-Western provincials longing to spend their days and nights in the libraries of Europe . I have to read all those . I have to pass on all those . p. 20 FAITH PROSPER ( Looks at the pile  --  with commiseration ) It must be terrible to have such power . CHARLES TANEY It 's worse than terrible . It 's boring . FAITH PROSPER Think of the good you can do . Think of the help you can give . CHARLES TANEY All because Seymour 's father was a film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PROSPER Willard 's first-rate . His book will be first-rate . If I were n't sure of it , I would n't ask you . CHARLES TANEY I 'll do what I can for Willard . I 'll try . FAITH PROSPER Please ! Please ! It 's the only thing I 'll ever ask of you . CHARLES TANEY I 'm not sole judge , you know . There 's a board . FAITH PROSPER Let the board read what Willard 's already written you read it . CHARLES TANEY I 'll take your word for it ! But there are other considerations , you know . I 'd better be frank . I 'll be up against it with the board , I 'm afraid , recommending an alcoholic . Willard wants to go abroad , does n't he ? Well , what assurance can I give that he wo n't drink himself to death there as his father did ? p. 21 FAITH PROSPER Willard 's been on the wagon for three months . And with the lift this will give him I stake my life on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I did n't  --  CHARLES TANEY ( Kindly ) I know . I do know . Leave it to me , darling . If it can be done  --  I 'll do it . Tell him to send me his manuscript what there is of it  --  ( ANNA comes in . At the same moment the telephone rings ) ANNA ( To FAITH ) A gentleman to see you , miss . CHARLES TANEY ( To ANNA ) Show him up , Anna . ( ANNA goes . CHARLIE goes to answer the telephone ) CHARLES TANEY ( On the telephone ) Oh , hello just a minute , darling I 'll take it on the other phone ( He leaves the phone . To FAITH ) I 'd better take this in the other room FAITH PROSPER ( Eaten with jealousy ) Not Gilian , by any chance ? CHARLES TANEY As it happens , it is Gilian . ( Starts for the door ) I 'll see Willard before he goes p. 22 FAITH PROSPER I can tell him then  --  that you 'll try ? CHARLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows in WILLARD . WILLARD is four years older than FAITH  --  twenty-eight . He is tall , gaunt , with a keen eye , and very attractive in a saturnine way ) FAITH PROSPER ( Very excited ) Hello , Will ! Oh , Will ! I think I have good news . ( WILLARD looks around the room ; he has a hawkeye . He takes everything in ) WILLARD PROSPER Perfect ! FAITH PROSPER Charlie went in to take a call . He 'll be in in a minute . WILLARD PROSPER ( Looks at the pictures ) Very progressive ! ( His eyes leave the pictures and again take in the room ) It 's almost too abrupt for me , you know . FAITH PROSPER What is ? WILLARD PROSPER The sudden transition  --  from the lower depths to the upper depths . ( He looks at her ) But you seem to move naturally on this exalted level . FAITH PROSPER Why are you so bitter with me ? p. 23 WILLARD PROSPER I was only remarking  --  that for me the transition is abrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FAITH PROSPER I think that Charlie will get you that grant . WILLARD PROSPER ( Goes to the table , picks up a " project , " looks at the heading  --  reads ) " Studies in the Coin Nomenclature of Etruscan Art . " Now who  --  I ask you , who  --  could pass on this fascinating subject more acutely than Charles Taney ? I saw just now  --  in my favorite column in my favorite newspaper  --  that Mr. Taney was at the Stork Club last night with our stepmother . Does he go into this , do you suppose ( He weighs the " project " in his hand ) the nomenclature of Etruscan coins , with the headwaiter at the Stork ? FAITH PROSPER Well , there 's a board  --  a board of experts . WILLARD PROSPER ( Picks up his father 's novel , opens it to the dedication page , stares at it  --  holds it away from him as if he could n't trust his eyes , then holds it close again and reads ) " For Charlie Since my dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men distinguish , her election hath sealed thee for herself ; for thou hast been as one , in suffering all , that suffers nothing. " Now , surely Father was drunk when he wrote that . He always spouted Shakespeare when he was drunk . p. 24 FAITH PROSPER ( Impatient ) Oh , let 's get away from Father for once ! WILLARD PROSPER ( Still staring at the inscription ) But does Mr. Taney suffer ? I am interested that he suffers . Do you do anything to alleviate his suffering ? FAITH PROSPER Charlie 's very nice . He 's a dear . WILLARD PROSPER I doubt both allegations . FAITH PROSPER He 's just promised me  --  he 'll do anything he can to get you that grant . I know he will . WILLARD PROSPER Dear sister . Nothing good will come to us from Charles Taney . FAITH PROSPER ( Exasperated ) Why do you say that ? You hardly know him . WILLARD PROSPER ( Still looking around at CHARLIE 's pictures ) Perfect . In fact , it 's too good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have n't been drinking ! WILLARD PROSPER Ca n't you tell ? There are two lucidities . The higher one  --  the lucidity of alcohol  --  and the grimmer one  --  the lucidity of sobriety . Ca n't you tell ? p. 25 FAITH PROSPER ( Relieved ) Thank God  --  for a moment I was worried . ( From upstairs we hear Bach played on the piano ) WILLARD PROSPER Who in this house plays Bach ? FAITH PROSPER Mr. Rosenthal , I guess . He lives upstairs . WILLARD PROSPER ( Stands behind the table heaped with projects ) Does n't it amuse you ? It does me . FAITH PROSPER What ? WILLARD PROSPER That of all the people to whom Seymour Rosenthal might have given this marvelous and highly lucrative job  --  the artists , the scholars , the people who really care about such things  --  that he picked the headwaiter at the Stork Club . FAITH PROSPER ( Scared again ) You are drunk ! I never can tell with you . WILLARD PROSPER I could n't have said that if I were drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PROSPER If only , Will , you 'd give up drinking ! WILLARD PROSPER ( Mildly ) I do n't ask you to give up sex . FAITH PROSPER ( Defiantly ) I love Charlie . p. 26 WILLARD PROSPER I had a most amusing time last night with your bassoonist . Since he could n't find you , he latched on to me . Have you ever been to his flat ? FAITH PROSPER ( Curtly ) No . WILLARD PROSPER You should go . He has two pianos . We fumbled through Beethoven quartets till all hours . He gave me a temperance lecture . You would have approved . To him I am paradoxical . He can not understand a simultaneous passion for Beethoven quartets and Scotch whiskey . It throws him . FAITH PROSPER I hate you in this mood . I almost wish you were drunk . WILLARD PROSPER Do n't worry . You 'll get your wish ! FAITH PROSPER When you 're drunk you never want to wound me . WILLARD PROSPER ( Really contrite  --  with tenderness ) Nor do I now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like the idea of you and Charlie , but then there 's so much in the world  --  practically everything , in fact  --  that I do n't like . I do n't , for instance , like the idea of myself and myself . My beloved Faith , my dear sister , what is to become of us ? FAITH PROSPER ( Stoutly ) I 'll be all right . And if you get this grant  --  which I believe you will  --  you 'll be all right . That 's a wonderful book . The subject suits you . It 'll turn out . I know it will . ( A pause ) p. 27 WILLARD PROSPER I stand in the street cold sober I stand in the street FAITH PROSPER What ? WILLARD PROSPER I see people hurrying by on the street . They are busy , absorbed , hurrying to an objective . I want to join them . But their lives are full . Seemingly full . No vacancies . I stand at the docks and watch cargoes being loaded . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sell , Presidents give press conferences , the world is busy . But I am not in the world . How can I get into the world ? Get me a ticket to the world . FAITH PROSPER ( She is affected ) Charlie will give you a ticket . WILLARD PROSPER Somehow , darling  --  I do n't know why it is  --  but somewhere I feel that a ticket issued me by Charlie will be refused at the gate . ( CHARLIE comes back , full of beans . He goes to WILLARD , gives him his hand ) CHARLES TANEY Delighted to see you . How are you ? WILLARD PROSPER The goose hangs high ! CHARLES TANEY ( Makes a gesture toward the bar ) Drink ? ( Too late to see FAITH shaking her head violently at him ) p. 28 WILLARD PROSPER No , thank you  --  I 'm on the wagon . ( FAITH sighs with relief  --  it was a near thing ) CHARLES TANEY Well  --  Faith 's been telling me about your project , what 's his name ? FAITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . That 's a good sign , is n't it ? I mean  --  I 'm reasonably educated  --  I flunked out at Yale and surely you ca n't do better than that  --  and if , with that impressive background of erudition , I have n't heard of Chamfort , there must be something wrong . I mean , not wrong with Chamfort , but with me . I 'd love to read what you 've written and then I can talk to you as one Chamfort man to another . WILLARD PROSPER If you become interested I 'll turn the project over to you and you can finish it . I 'll take over your job and , if I like the way you 've finished Chamfort , I 'll give you a grant . CHARLES TANEY ( Delighted  --  turns to FAITH ) Say , Faith ! You did n't tell me your brother was amusing . She always tells me what a scholar you are ! She makes you sound grim . Come up for dinner . ( Remembers ) Oh , but I forgot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't got a cook . Have you told him , Faith , the calamity that befell me ? p. 29 FAITH PROSPER ( Smiles , delighted things are going so well ) Not yet , I will . ( The Bach stops . The buzzer on CHARLIE 's desk sounds . CHARLIE takes it ) CHARLES TANEY ( On the telephone ) Yes , Seymour ? No , I 'm not Miss Prosper 's still here and her brother Willard As a matter of fact , Mr. Prosper has a project about which I 'm very anxious to talk to you . Be right up . FAITH PROSPER ( Swimming in gratitude ) You 're a darling ! CHARLES TANEY That 's what we 're here for  --  to be darlings . When do I see you , Faith ? FAITH PROSPER When do you want ? CHARLES TANEY I 'll call you in the morning . FAITH PROSPER Do . CHARLES TANEY ( Starts to go ) ' Bye , Willard . Awfully nice to see you . WILLARD PROSPER Thank you . Same here . CHARLES TANEY ( Stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd better warn you FAITH PROSPER Yes ? p. 30 CHARLES TANEY Gilian 's coming . She 's having dinner here . FAITH PROSPER We 'll clear out in time . CHARLES TANEY ( Just as he 's going  --  to WILLARD ) What 's that feller 's name again ? The feller you 're writing about ? WILLARD PROSPER Chamfort . CHARLES TANEY ( Memorizing it as he goes upstairs ) Chamfort . Chamfort . FAITH PROSPER ( The moment CHARLIE is gone ) There ! Are n't you encouraged ? I 'm terribly encouraged . You handled your end very well ! WILLARD PROSPER That , I believe , is what is called small talk . It was hardly visible . FAITH PROSPER What time is it ? WILLARD PROSPER I pawned my watch . Find I do n't need one . FAITH PROSPER Well , I 've got to be getting to the theatre . We 'll have a bite somewhere . WILLARD PROSPER Fine . FAITH PROSPER I 'll just get my coat . Wo n't be a minute . ( She runs to the bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar . He makes for it . He pours himself a stiff one and swallows it . He pours himself another and holds it . He stands at the bar , talking to himself ) p. 31 WILLARD PROSPER ( Aloud ) Commitment . Involvement . Act . ( FAITH comes back . She looks at him . She sees what has happened . She is devastated ) FAITH PROSPER Will ! Will ! ( She runs to him , takes the glass he holds away from him ) Just now , Willard ! When things are looking up ! Just now ! WILLARD PROSPER Lucidity on a high level . Commitment . Involvement . FAITH PROSPER ( In despair ) Just this minute ! Did you have to ? ( ANNA comes in . She carries a huge bouquet of flowers . She puts them in a vase  --  and the accompanying card beside it . She does this as if the task were distasteful to her and walks out without a word to FAITH ) WILLARD PROSPER ( To FAITH who is looking down at the card that came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend ! ( FAITH says nothing ) Are they from the lady of the Stork , our dear stepmother ? ( Compulsively he goes to the table , picks up the envelope ) FAITH PROSPER Do n't do that ! ( Nevertheless , he takes out the card ) They are from her . I know her handwriting . ( WILLARD has opened the envelope , reads the message . He laughs . FAITH takes the card and without reading it , puts it back into its envelope beside the vase ) p. 32 WILLARD PROSPER She writes funny messages , Gilian  --  I 'll say that . FAITH PROSPER I do n't mind hating Gilian . I 'm used to that . What I do n't like is being jealous of her . WILLARD PROSPER It 's very funny . They possess the earth . It 's very funny . FAITH PROSPER ( In a subdued voice ) I 'll be late for the theatre . Come , Will . WILLARD PROSPER ( Mumbling to himself ) Even if life is meaningless , you must do something . FAITH PROSPER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 'm trying to keep up . What do you want to do to me ? You scare me ! WILLARD PROSPER ( Looks at her with deep tenderness , with compassion ) I scare you ! How can I scare you ? I love you . You 're the only thing in the world I love . Out of all the grimy past  --  FAITH PROSPER ( Passionately ) We 've got to stop eternally souping ourselves in the past . It 's dead . Let it stay dead . WILLARD PROSPER You 're wrong . The past is not dead . It 's the only thing that 's alive . We 're the sum of it . p. 33 FAITH PROSPER ( Desperately ) There must be some way of getting away from it ! WILLARD PROSPER There is n't . You can get away from the present  --  through drink or sex  --  but not from the past . FAITH PROSPER ( Moves to the street door ) Take me to the theatre . WILLARD PROSPER All right . Can you sneak me in ? I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first production . It was a failure then , and now it 's a tremendous hit . Royalties for the glamorous widow . ( Gestures toward the flowers ) Flowers for the glamorous Foundation head . Will you sneak me in ? I 'll stand at the back . FAITH PROSPER If you want to . But why ? WILLARD PROSPER I want to see how mean my grandparents were to our poor , brow-beaten Daddy . Whatever he went through he made us go through twice as much . No inheritance tax on that legacy . It 's so touching . I want to weep for his sufferings . I want to ( GILLIAN comes in . She is radiantly lovely . About forty . She walks through life secure in her beauty ) GILIAN PROSPER Oh , I 'm sorry FAITH PROSPER We 're just leaving p. 34 GILIAN PROSPER I 'm Gilian . I 've asked Charlie so many times to let me meet you . But he would n't . He is possessive , is n't he ? ( Looks at her admiringly ) And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PROSPER ( Off balance , embarrassed ) Thank you . This is my brother Willard . WILLARD PROSPER We 've met . GILIAN PROSPER ( Takes him in ) Yes . But you were a boy then  --  you were WILLARD PROSPER I was eighteen , to be exact . GILIAN PROSPER I remember . Of course I remember . That meeting was unfortunate . So sad . But future ones need n't be . Need they ? ( WILLARD laughs . GILIAN turns to FAITH in wonder ) But he 's the image of Craig , is n't he ? Just look at photographs of your father young . It 's startling the resemblance . Everything of his father . ( Stares at WILLARD ) Yes . Everything ! WILLARD PROSPER Everything except the effrontery of his genius . GILIAN PROSPER I know you both dislike me . I know you both think of me as a kind of monster . But I 'm not really . Get to know me . ( She laughs  --  a silvery , tinkling laugh  --  to both of them ) I 'll meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35 FAITH PROSPER ( Wanting to get out of the room ) Willard  --  please  --  I 'm late WILLARD PROSPER O.K. ( FAITH , very disturbed , goes out . WILLARD lingers a moment ) WILLARD PROSPER ( To GILIAN ) It 's really unjust , you know , that you should be beautiful . GILIAN PROSPER ( Her eyes on him ) But , dear Willard , injustice is the essence of everything , is n't it ? Is n't it immature  --  to expect justice ? But then , in many ways , your father was immature , was n't he ? So you 're your father 's son in that way too . WILLARD PROSPER ( His eyes on her , spelled by her ) I can see why he loved you . I can see why he was obsessed by you . GILIAN PROSPER But he was n't , was he ? He left me . WILLARD PROSPER I can see why he did that too . ( WILLARD goes out . She stands looking after him . She smiles to herself ; she is pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment later , WILLARD comes back . They stand looking at each other , spelled by each other ) GILIAN PROSPER ( Smiles at him ) Nice to see you again ! ( FAITH appears in the doorway for a moment . She is very tense , disturbed ) p. 36 FAITH PROSPER Willard  --  I 'll be late WILLARD PROSPER ( Without taking his eyes from GILIAN 's ) Go on without me . I 'll stop by at the theatre . ( FAITH , burned up , goes without a word , shutting the door after her ) GILIAN PROSPER The last time too  --  I wanted to see you again . The last time too , I was sorry when they took you away . I showed you that , did n't I ? You knew that , did n't you ? ( He keeps staring at her , saying nothing ) I remember now  --  so vividly  --  what happened , exactly what happened  --  so vividly . Do you ? WILLARD PROSPER I remember it differently  --  at different times . GILIAN PROSPER You came that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( WILLARD keeps staring at her ) Quite frightening it was . You frightened me when you burst in . You looked quite wild . Obsessed . WILLARD PROSPER Did I ? GILIAN PROSPER You came to kill your father . I saw it in your eyes when you came in . But for me you might have done it . It would n't have been nice  --  would it ? It would n't have been  --  useful , would it ? You hated me too . I saw that too  --  in your eyes . Though it was your father you struck down , it was me you wanted to strike down . p. 37 WILLARD PROSPER Do you think so ? GILIAN PROSPER Yes . You hated me . You wanted to kill me too . Was it because I made your father happy ? WILLARD PROSPER I do n't remember it that way . GILIAN PROSPER You blamed me , did n't you , for your brother 's suicide ? I understand it . But it was n't just  --  not really just . WILLARD PROSPER ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older now . You 're a grown man now . Perhaps you can be more objective . WILLARD PROSPER If you want me to be objective , I 'll try to be objective . GILIAN PROSPER Were n't you jealous and resentful  --  all you children  --  that at last , after his terrible life , your father had found happiness with me ? Were n't you ? WILLARD PROSPER ( Stubbornly ) That 's not how I remember it . GILIAN PROSPER Your brother kept pestering me on the telephone  --  to put your father on so he could unload his petty little troubles on him . Your father was in a fragile state  --  begging to be left alone  --  trying to work . He did n't want to be disturbed ( With a half-smile ) except by me . I tried to do what he wanted . To give him the isolation he craved . Was it wrong of me to do that p. 38 WILLARD PROSPER Nothing occurs to me . GILIAN PROSPER ( After a moment ) I have to tell you , Willard , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do exactly the same . WILLARD PROSPER Would you ? GILIAN PROSPER I had kept from your father the news of your brother 's suicide . There was a blizzard and I told him the papers had n't come . So he never knew . I was guarding his peace of mind . He never knew  --  till you broke in and told him . You said to him something you should n't have said . He never got over it  --  what you said . WILLARD PROSPER What did I say ? GILIAN PROSPER ( Apologizing for him ) Of course you were young . You were very , very young . You accused your father : " In your works you are a great humanitarian , " you said , " but your avocation is infanticide . " WILLARD PROSPER That does sound young . GILIAN PROSPER And then you struck him . He fell to the ground . For a moment I thought you had killed him . You must have thought so too . Because you began to cry . That touched me  --  when you cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILLARD PROSPER ( Dryly ) Still  --  you sent for the police . p. 39 GILIAN PROSPER I had to . We were so isolated there . I thought Craig might die . What could I do when you broke in ? I 'd been reading to him quietly . He always asked me to read aloud to him what he 'd written . He wanted me  --  and only me . Well , I gave him what he wanted . I tried . I protected him from inroads from the outside . I 'll admit I found you  --  all of his children by my predecessors  --  rather a bore . I felt that you were parasites on his fame . You all meant nothing to him and I was everything to him . Ca n't you see it from my point of view ? WILLARD PROSPER ( Carefully , controlling himself ) I will make an effort  --  to stretch objectivity to the breaking point . GILIAN PROSPER My life was n't easy , you know . WILLARD PROSPER Well , you had a pretty good run , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , holding hands with fame GILIAN PROSPER Craig was wonderful , but he was tiresome too . I love life and people and  --  and  --  WILLARD PROSPER Life and people . GILIAN PROSPER ( Laughs ) Yes . And life and people were the last things your father wanted . He wanted to be shut away from everybody so that he could contemplate his doom . He insisted endlessly on being doomed . No compliment to me , was it ? I hated that side of him . And yet  --  the other side  --  the creative side  --  that was wonderful . You know I have always been attracted by productive men . Their age meant nothing to me . Your father was thirty years older than I was  --  but productive . All my husbands  --  and all my lovers  --  have been creative men  --  artists or writers p. 40 WILLARD PROSPER ( Who is documented ) Conductors GILIAN PROSPER Oh , that was very brief . He was a pompous ass  --  but he was a great conductor . God , he was boring when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think you 'll ever forgive me ? Do you think you will ever learn to forgive me ? WILLARD PROSPER Is that important ? GILIAN PROSPER Not really . Forgiveness  --  what a condescending word ! Especially since  --  as I say  --  I 'd do it again . You gave me an awful lot of trouble , you know . I ca n't tell you what it took  --  in the weeks that followed  --  to get Craig back . He was shattered . Still , I forgave you even then . Right then . Do you remember ? Just before they took you away , I kissed you . Do you remember ? WILLARD PROSPER In jail  --  I wondered why you did it . GILIAN PROSPER ( Smiles at him as if she might do it again . Lightly ) Because I felt like it . ( GILIAN goes to the flowers she has sent CHARLIE . Picks off a blossom . Goes to WILLARD and puts it into his buttonhole ) There . You look quite smart . Odd , is n't it ? That we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find so exciting about life  --  that it is unpredictable . That is what I enjoy about myself  --  that I am unpredictable . Shall I ask Charlie to invite you to dinner ? p. 41 WILLARD PROSPER Thank you , no . GILIAN PROSPER Why not ? WILLARD PROSPER I 'm afraid that if he gives me dinner he will feel that he 's done quite enough for me , and I am after him for more . GILIAN PROSPER Oh ? WILLARD PROSPER A grant . GILIAN PROSPER I 'll work on Charlie for that . I have influence with Charlie . WILLARD PROSPER ( With bite ) I 'm sure you have ! ( They exchange a long look . She is smiling . His expression is inscrutable ) GILIAN PROSPER You still hate me , do n't you ? WILLARD PROSPER You must give me time . I 'll study to be ( Manifestly putting quotes around the word ) " objective . " ( He goes out abruptly . She stands looking after him , still smiling . She feels the exaltation of having made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts to make herself a drink . Carrying the drink , she crosses the room to her comfortable , habitual armchair . On the cross she stops at the table , picks up her husband 's novel , sets her drink down , opens it , looks at the inscription and reads it aloud ) p. 42 GILIAN PROSPER " For Charlie , but for whom this book would have been finished much sooner ! " ( She laughs her little , tinkling laugh ) Good old Charlie ! ( She picks up her drink and goes to the armchair . Sipping her drink , a smile plays about her lips . CHARLIE comes back ) CHARLES TANEY Hello , pet . Been waiting long ? Up talking to Seymour . Raving about you . I did n't know you 'd met him at the Boardmans ' . GILIAN PROSPER Thought I 'd told you . CHARLES TANEY You did n't tell me . He 's in an absolute dither about you . GILIAN PROSPER Why do n't you ask him down to have dinner with us ? CHARLES TANEY I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's very conscientious , you know , about his homework ! ( He says this with an overtone of derision ) GILIAN PROSPER If he prefers reading to me he ca n't be in much of a dither ! CHARLES TANEY He 's shy . I think you overwhelmed him a bit . GILIAN PROSPER I found him most appealing . Gives the impression of being  --  vulnerable . CHARLES TANEY You like that , do n't you ? p. 43 GILIAN PROSPER Do n't you ? CHARLES TANEY ( Smiles at her ) Yes . I do . Especially when , as well as being vulnerable , they are very , very rich . GILIAN PROSPER I got a bit the feeling  --  charming though he was CHARLES TANEY Yes ? GILIAN PROSPER That if he had the courage  --  and the virility  --  that he 'd be a pansy . CHARLES TANEY Not at all . I 've known him a long time and I do n't think so at all . Nothing at all wrong with Seymour except he feels guilty and inadequate and he wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cures him of his inadequacy ? Would that be good for you ? CHARLES TANEY I have instructed Alvin to make him independent of everybody but me ! ( She laughs . So does he ) But maybe you 're right . Who knows ? Never thought of that ! Maybe that 's why he 's afraid to see Alvin . GILIAN PROSPER But how unenterprising ! How childish ! Why should n't he have the courage  --  especially with all that money  --  to be himself  --  or herself ? CHARLES TANEY Well , I 'm doing my best . He makes appointments with Alvin . He does n't show up . p. 44 GILIAN PROSPER He dated me . CHARLES TANEY Did he ? Did he ! Well , maybe if he sees you , he wo n't have to see Doctor Greer . GILIAN PROSPER ( Laughs ) Oh , Charlie , you amuse me more than anybody . When I know I 'm going to have dinner with you the whole day takes on a bright , new face . CHARLES TANEY ( Testing her out ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Come to think of it  --  perfect ! GILIAN PROSPER ( Teasing ) Think I might convert him , do you ? If he needs conversion . CHARLES TANEY I do n't know . It would n't matter ( By this time CHARLIE has poured himself a drink and sits cozily beside her ) When you come to think of it , Gilian ! What are the most successful marriages you know ? Especially in the arts  --  everywhere else for all I know . Between homosexuals . Absolutely happy . GILIAN PROSPER But I do n't qualify . It would be lopsided . CHARLES TANEY I know lopsided ones too . Perfectly happy . Where the sexual interest is elsewhere , it lessens the area of conflict . If the ultimate objective of marriage  --  after sex goes  --  is companionship  --  well , they have it from the beginning , do n't they ? p. 45 GILIAN PROSPER But Seymour 's married , is n't he ? CHARLES TANEY Just getting his divorce . GILIAN PROSPER Do you know his wife ? CHARLES TANEY Oh , yes  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She likes to ski . GILIAN PROSPER He hero-worships you . Never saw anything like it . CHARLES TANEY ( Genially ) Valuable attribute , hero-worship . Gives the young something to which to aspire . GILIAN PROSPER He says you practically saved his life . Was he drowning ? CHARLES TANEY In his mind he was . He did have a period at Yale  --  when he was suicidal . GILIAN PROSPER And you ? CHARLES TANEY I stuck by him . GILIAN PROSPER How ? CHARLES TANEY I tried to get him into my fraternity . They would n't have him because he was Jewish . I made an issue of it . I resigned from the fraternity . GILIAN PROSPER That was noble of you ! CHARLES TANEY ( In apology ) I was young ! p. 46 GILIAN PROSPER And tell me , darling , when you did this quixotic thing ? CHARLES TANEY Yes ? GILIAN PROSPER Did you perhaps have an intuition that someday  --  Seymour might come in handy for you ? CHARLES TANEY ( Beams at her ) It was more than an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PROSPER ( Delighted ) You are an artist , Charlie . An artist with people . CHARLES TANEY He was scared , Seymour  --  pathetic . He had this overwhelming , monstrous Napoleonic father of whom he was ashamed . Film tycoon . He was an America Firster , Seymour 's father  --  the poor boy had a hell of a time even applying for Yale because Daddy said Yale was Communistic . His mother gave him the money to go Daddy would n't . I knew his mother  --  a sweet woman . After Daddy grew great he naturally kicked her out . GILIAN PROSPER ( Sticks to the point ) But the idea for the Foundation  --  when did you get that ? CHARLES TANEY The day I got kicked out and I had to think of something . Great institution Yale  --  you meet interesting people p. 47 GILIAN PROSPER Why were you kicked out ? CHARLES TANEY ( Smiles at her ) None of your business ! GILIAN PROSPER You are truly wonderful ! CHARLES TANEY ( Smiles at her ) That is an understatement . GILIAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  for this marvelous , opulent , cushy job how could you have known ? CHARLES TANEY But they hang on every bush  --  these unhappy American gilded youths  --  they buy radical newspapers that bait the rich , they support fellow-traveling organizations that , if they obtained their objectives , would impoverish them , they 're all masochists striving pathetically to expiate something or other . Seymour really had something to expiate ! It occurred to me that he might atone for his father 's assaults upon art on the silver screen by starting a foundation that would help impecunious artists . He did and it 's a going concern , and Seymour tells me that he 's never been so happy in his life . He 's not the philanthropist . I 'm the philanthropist  --  because I 've made him happy ! GILIAN PROSPER ( Casually ) How rich a millionaire is Seymour anyway ? Multi , of course , but how multi ? p. 48 CHARLES TANEY Modestly multi ! GILIAN PROSPER Then is n't this Foundation a terrible extravagance ? Could he get out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now you are encroaching on classified material . Top secret . GILIAN PROSPER ( Smiles at him ) I see I wo n't get it out of you . I 'll get it out of Seymour . CHARLES TANEY ( Amiably ) I 'll advise him not to tell you . GILIAN PROSPER What do you bet I find out ? CHARLES TANEY ( With an irony edged with apprehension , but very friendly ) In a contest of such a delicate nature , dearest Gilian , I would never bet against you . ( GILIAN laughs . A moment 's pause . She feels she perhaps has gone a bit too far  --  decides to change the subject . Points to the flowers ) GILIAN PROSPER You have n't thanked me for the flowers . ( CHARLIE gets up . Goes to the flowers ) CHARLES TANEY Thank you , darling . Very sweet of you . ( As he reads the card ) Very neat , though as usual  --  inconclusive . ( She smiles . He comes back to her ) p. 49 GILIAN PROSPER I met them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? GILIAN PROSPER My stepchildren . CHARLES TANEY ( This does startle him ) You did n't . GILIAN PROSPER I did indeed ! CHARLES TANEY I warned them . I warned them you were coming . GILIAN PROSPER Am I an epidemic ? CHARLES TANEY ( Chuckling ) You certainly are ! Well , how did it go ? Was it awkward ? GILIAN PROSPER ( Almost to herself ) I did n't allow it to be . I was quite startled by Willard . So like his father . CHARLES TANEY Well , there 's nothing surprising in that . GILIAN PROSPER ( Silken ) And I congratulate you on Faith . I do n't blame you , darling . I do n't blame you a bit . CHARLES TANEY You offer me no alternative , do you ? You ca n't be a bitch in the manger , can you , darling ? GILIAN PROSPER Have you thought of marrying Faith ? CHARLES TANEY Faith would n't like me at all if she knew me. p. 50 GILIAN PROSPER I gather she does  --  know you . CHARLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would bore me to be the sort of person Faith thinks I am . GILIAN PROSPER I 'd hate it if you married her , but I would n't blame you . ( A moment . He looks at her , decides to put out a feeler ) CHARLES TANEY She blames you ! You are the obstacle , she says . GILIAN PROSPER ( Pleased ) Does she ? Does she really ? CHARLES TANEY ( Lightly ) And maybe you are . GILIAN PROSPER Oh , come now , Charlie ! What would marriage give us that we have n't got now ? CHARLES TANEY Concentration . GILIAN PROSPER Now , Charlie ! You know perfectly well  --  we are both too talented to waste our skills on each other . We should distribute them . ( A moment . He studies her ) CHARLES TANEY I have never had the margin to think of the present . I have always had to think of the future . I have to think of it now . GILIAN PROSPER Is n't Seymour  --  safe ? p. 51 CHARLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my experience I have found  --  GILIAN PROSPER ( Listening closely , in spite of his casual tone ) Yes ? CHARLES TANEY That you ca n't count on anyone  --  that everyone is unpredictable . GILIAN PROSPER Including me ? CHARLES TANEY Especially you . GILIAN PROSPER Oh , come now , Charlie , you 're my steady  --  as no one has ever been . Who 're you worried about now ? CHARLES TANEY ( Looking at her  --  searching her eyes ) No one . No one in particular . GILIAN PROSPER ( Absolved ) Well then ! CHARLES TANEY That increases the potential of danger . It makes me feel very  --  insecure . GILIAN PROSPER ( Laughs ) That 's right . I 'd hate you to feel secure  --  and then have to disappoint you . CHARLES TANEY ( Stares at her , suddenly gloomy ) You 'll disappoint me , all right . GILIAN PROSPER ( Reflectively ) I ca n't get over it  --  Craig  --  all those common wives before me  --  and yet  --  those attractive children p. 52 CHARLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've told you often enough  --  distinguished Southern family . CHARLES TANEY Too bad they moved to Chicago ! GILIAN PROSPER Yes , that was unfortunate , but I was conceived , do n't forget ( She kicks his foot ) , in Charleston , South Carolina . CHARLES TANEY ( Lifts his drink to her ) I salute the Southern aristocracy . GILIAN PROSPER ( Smiles at him ) But I 'm not in the least a snob . I know you 're common , and yet I adore you . I have never believed , for instance , that your name is Taney . CHARLES TANEY It is n't . GILIAN PROSPER ( Deeply curious ) What is it ? Tell me . Tell me , darling . I promise  --  I wo n't tell a soul . What 's your real name ? CHARLES TANEY ( With mock dignity ) You do n't know me well enough to ask me personal questions like that . GILIAN PROSPER ( She laughs . After a moment ) Willard 's after you for a grant , I gather . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GILIAN PROSPER Are you going to give it to him ? CHARLES TANEY He 's a lush . GILIAN PROSPER So was Craig . CHARLES TANEY Yes  --  but with a difference . GILIAN PROSPER Give it to him . Seymour can afford it . CHARLES TANEY My job is to keep Seymour from making mistakes . ( Gives her a sharp look ) Willard and Faith both loathe you . Is n't it noble of you to intercede in their behalf ? GILIAN PROSPER But is n't nobility a quality we both share ? Think of your nobility in resigning from the frat . Craig despised you . You must know that , do n't you ? CHARLES TANEY Of course I knew it . GILIAN PROSPER And yet it did n't keep you from being warm friends , did it ? Craig once said to me : " I like having Charlie around . I study him . He justifies me in despising the human race ! " CHARLES TANEY He said it to me once when he was drunk . He was always on the qui vive for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And yet  --  in an odd way  --  I took comfort from his lapses . I thought : " You can be a man of genius and you can also be what Craig is ! " ( With a disarming smile at her ) It consoled me for not being a man of genius ! p. 54 GILIAN PROSPER I do adore you , Charlie . You are perfectly honest  --  at least with me ! CHARLES TANEY But Craig was useful to me  --  useful to the Foundation  --  his prestige helped get it started . But he disgusted me . He was all mixed up about sex , for one thing . He took it so seriously . He mixed it up with sin . GILIAN PROSPER I know  --  with all his wives and with all his girls , he was inexperienced in sex . His interest in it was morbid , guilt-ridden . He was a Puritan . Awful . There 's nothing more awful than a sex-ridden Puritan . Do n't you agree ? CHARLES TANEY I can have no opinion as I am only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Charlie , more than anybody . You are funny ! CHARLES TANEY Of course I 'm funny . If I were sick I 'd be a sick comedian . ( They look at each other , smiling at each other in mutual appreciation and understanding . From upstairs we hear the austere , massive and passionate chords of Bach 's Fantasia and Fugue . GILIAN listens ) GILIAN PROSPER Seymour ? CHARLES TANEY Yes . He 's always at the God-damn piano . Gets it out of his system that way . ( He makes a helpless gesture ) I love Seymour  --  but I have to admit  --  he 's a bit of a jerk . p. 55 GILIAN PROSPER ( Smiling a bit ) I do n't agree , you know . I think you underestimate him . CHARLES TANEY ( Looks at her narrowly ) Do you think so ? GILIAN PROSPER ( Listening to the music ) Yes , I think you do . I am sure you do . ( A moment . He keeps looking at her ) I am really very taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Are you ? GILIAN PROSPER I think I am . CHARLES TANEY ( His voice sharp with irony  --  he feels a pang of jealousy ) He 's lucky ! ( A moment  --  he gives her a searching look ) Maybe then I 'll have to begin to worry about Seymour  --  GILIAN PROSPER Maybe . Better than just being worried at large  --  is n't it ? ( She slaps his cheek affectionately . ANNA comes in ) ANNA Dinner is served , Mr. Taney . GILIAN PROSPER Good ! I 'm starved ! ( ANNA goes out . GILIAN gets up ) p. 56 CHARLES TANEY I 've got terrible news for you , Gilian . GILIAN PROSPER ( Mischievous , knows what it is ) Really ? What about ? CHARLES TANEY Anna ! She 's leaving me . I suppose now you 'll drop me . It will be interesting to see whether you drop me . GILIAN PROSPER On the contrary  --  it only strengthens my hold on you . ( She entwines her arm with his and starts him toward dining room ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna 's coming to work for me ! ( He stops , absolutely dazed ) So you see , darling , you 'll be almost as dependent on me as Seymour is on you ! CHARLES TANEY ( Disentwines his arm from hers , stares at her ) I 'll  --  be  --  God damned ! GILIAN PROSPER ( Joyously ) On the contrary , darling , you 'll be well fed  --  in the style to which you 've been accustomed ! CHARLES TANEY ( He looks at her aghast ) This is really a bit thick ! If you 'd take Anna away from me , you 'd take anyone away from me . Really , Gilian , you 're capable of anything , are n't you ? p. 57 GILIAN PROSPER Of course I am , darling . So are you . That 's what makes us such good companions , is n't it ? ( She links her arm in his again , and smiling at the really devastated CHARLIE , she walks him into the dining room , accompanied by Bach ) @x Scene : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At rise : SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL is sitting at CHARLIE 'S big table . He is studying an application form . CHARLES TANEY Highball , Seymour ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Poring over the form , frowning ) No , thank you , Charlie . CHARLES TANEY ( Drink in hand , walks to table , sees his preoccupation ) You seem anxious . What 's worrying you ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Taps the form ) Brock Dunnaway . He wants a renewal . CHARLES TANEY I know . And as you see from my notation  --  I think we should turn him down . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Troubled ) I know . ( He puts the form down , gets up , walks around , in quiet perplexity ) But I just hate to , Charlie . I just hate to . CHARLES TANEY Look , Seymour ! We gave him a grant two years ago . He 's turned in nothing . I do n't think he ever will . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL He wrote the greatest novel of the First World War . He must be well over seventy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he says , all his experience of life . It 's considerable  --  that experience . p. 59 CHARLES TANEY I do n't believe for a moment that he 's working on it  --  or anything . He 's just living off your grant . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL He says  --  ( He returns to the application , picks it up ) he says that he 's slower than he used to be  --  that he 's become self-critical and even self-conscious  --  but he thinks that what he is doing now will surpass his early masterpiece . Makes sense , does n't it ? ( Anxiously ) Does n't it make sense ? CHARLES TANEY He 's faking . I do n't think he 's doing a thing . ( A pause . SEYMOUR resumes his pacing ) SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL But suppose he 's telling the truth ? Suppose he 's agonizing  --  suffering over something  --  trying to get it out of himself  --  it ca n't be easy you know  --  at his age . CHARLES TANEY He 's very spry . Very lively . I get more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you 're not running your Foundation , dear boy , to support indigent writers . You 're running it to get some gifted young people over the bumps . I say  --  turn him down . I 'll do it . You do n't have to even see him . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I asked him to come here . p. 60 CHARLES TANEY Good ! I love Brock . He 's so nasty ! But turn him down . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL He wrote one great book . Maybe CHARLES TANEY He wo n't do it again . He 's a one-shot . Woods are full of ' em . They write one good thing and that 's it . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Pained ) I suppose you 're right . I hardly know him , you know  --  have just spoken to him on the telephone CHARLES TANEY ( Sees how painful this is for SEYMOUR ) If you want to help him out with a personal loan do it  --  but do n't clutter up the Foundation . We can use that grant for better prospects , I assure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boss . CHARLES TANEY ( Smiles at him ) Gracious of you to say so ! SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I always take your advice . You know that . CHARLES TANEY ( Goes to the table , fishes for a form in the pile ) There 's an application I 've been asked to ask you to consider might give him Brock 's stipend , as a matter of fact p. 61 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Who ? CHARLES TANEY Willard Prosper . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Any relation to Craig ? CHARLES TANEY Son . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Did n't he commit suicide ? CHARLES TANEY That was his brother . This one ( He taps the form ) has n't yet . His chances , though , are rosy ! SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Is he a writer ? CHARLES TANEY He 's a scholar . For all I know he can even write . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL What 's his project ? CHARLES TANEY Some son-of-a-bitch named Chamfort . ( Peers at the application ) Chamfort , Sbastien Roch Nicolas to be exact ! SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Pleased ) Oh , that 's very interesting ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell me you know who the hell he is ! SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( With diffidence ) I 'm interested in that period  --  I 've read quite a bit in it . CHARLES TANEY Is he worthy of our attention ? p. 62 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL He was a fascinating man . Very witty . Lived by his wit . CHARLES TANEY That wants doing ! I live by my wits . It 's easier when it 's plural , if you know what I mean ! SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Quotes ) " I am leaving this world where your heart will be broken unless it 's made of bronze . " He was as good as his word . He killed himself . CHARLES TANEY Well , Willard 's heart is n't made of bronze either , so he 'll probably imitate his hero . He wo n't be missed much  --  except by his sister . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL A son of Craig Prosper 's  --  I 'd like to meet him . CHARLES TANEY You wo n't be able to avoid it . His book 's half done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read what he 's written . CHARLES TANEY ( With irony ) I think that can be arranged ! I have to warn you though , Seymour SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL What about ? CHARLES TANEY Willard 's a lush . He 's nuts . He 's desperate  --  and he 's got a good deal to be desperate about ! SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( With reverence ) Craig Prosper 's son ! p. 63 CHARLES TANEY Yah , and I do n't think he 'll ever get over it ! ( MISS SAUNDERS pops her head in ) NAOMI SAUNDERS Mr. Dunnaway to see Mr. Rosenthal . CHARLES TANEY Send him in . Any luck with a cook , Miss Saunders ? NAOMI SAUNDERS Not so far . I 've interviewed dozens . ( She goes out . CHARLIE groans ) CHARLES TANEY God , how I miss Anna ! Gilian took her away . She takes everything away . I promised to get Gilian out of a boring cocktail party . I 'll be right back . Stick around . We 'll have dinner together  --  ( Starts to go  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brock ? You 're sure you can be firm ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Smiles ) I think so . CHARLES TANEY ( Pleased with him ) It 's a tough world you know , Seymour . Be back in a jiff . ( CHARLIE goes . SEYMOUR sits at the table  --  he keeps staring at the Chamfort dossier ) SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( To himself ) Prosper . Willard Prosper ( BROCK DUNNAWAY comes in . He is a spry seventy , little , nimble , with a sharp , glittering eye . He has a genial smile , a genial manner . He speaks with beautiful diction and great precision . SEYMOUR rises to greet him ) p. 64 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Shyly ) I 'm Seymour Rosenthal . BROCK DUNNAWAY It is very good of you to see me . You have been my benefactor for two years and I am glad of the opportunity to thank you personally . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL It has been an opportunity for us , Mr. Dunnaway . Your novel was my bible when I was young . Would n't you like a drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( SEYMOUR goes to the bar to mix him a drink ) SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Scotch  --  martini BROCK DUNNAWAY Scotch on the rocks would be fine . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL That 's easy do sit down ( Points ) That 's the comfortable chair  --  Charlie 's ( He smiles and so does BROCK , in a somewhat wintry way . He ensconces himself in the chair ) BROCK DUNNAWAY I knew your father quite well , you know . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Wryly ) So did I ! BROCK DUNNAWAY He was most amusing . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I did n't always find him so . p. 65 BROCK DUNNAWAY Put on a great show . Always acting . I enjoyed him ! ( SEYMOUR brings BROCK his drink ) Thank you very much . I remembered  --  coming up here  --  I remembered SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Politely ) Yes ? BROCK DUNNAWAY It was in your father 's office that I read my obituary . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( With a shy attempt at humor ) Was it favorable ? BROCK DUNNAWAY ( Smiles ) It was laconic . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official guest  --  to advise on the filming of my book  --  I got a great reception . Lunch in the executives ' dining room  --  a bang-up dinner at your father 's house It was in the great days  --  when the industry was number five  --  right after General Motors . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I was very young . But I remember when you came . BROCK DUNNAWAY On my second visit , though , there were no bouquets . I telephoned your father and he invited me to his office . I came in the hope of a job , but your father said nothing about that . He just sat there behind that hemispheric desk , encircled by that rosary of telephones , and entertained me . I saw quickly that I was wasting my time  --  which was n't worth much  --  and his  --  which was worth a good deal . Then he had an important telephone call  --  I suspected that it was contrived so he could get rid of me . He excused himself  --  said he 'd be right back . While he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sitting in the papal chair . I picked up that little bust of Napoleon p. 66 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( With bitterness at last ) Father was very addicted to Napoleon . He was terribly disappointed in me  --  when he realized I was never going to be Napoleon . BROCK DUNNAWAY On his desk also  --  was my obituary . ( BROCK pauses ) It was a mass obituary . It was a sheet of plain yellow paper headed in caps-WRITERS AVAILABLE . Now as you know , in Hollywood , in those throbbing days , to be available was automatically to be undesirable . I looked down that list . It was a necrologue  --  playwrights who had had one success , novelists who had had one success  --  like myself . I could n't remember who most of them were ; I could n't then remember who I was . Scott Fitzgerald was on that list . I took comfort in that . I knew then that Scott was doomed because he was available , but I felt he might survive elsewhere . I took comfort in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Half to himself ) Imagine a world where Scott Fitzgerald has to win the approval of my father ! BROCK DUNNAWAY ( Sips his drink  --  cheerfully ) That 's the kind of world it is ! And it 's not so bad , is it ? I wish your father were alive . I 'd like to tell him you 're supporting me ! Would he like that ? Too bad Scott is n't alive . You could support him , who deserves it far better than I. If he were alive he would n't be as popular as he is now  --  and he 'd need your help . ( BROCK does n't realize  --  or perhaps he does  --  how very difficult he is making it for SEYMOUR . SEYMOUR gets up , goes to the bar and pours himself a drink . He feels he needs it ) p. 67 BROCK DUNNAWAY ( While SEYMOUR is at the bar ) I have asked for a renewal of my grant . I realize that , so far , there is n't much to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am working on is one that I have been carrying around for many years . I want to write it before I die . I 'd like to tell you a little about it . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I 'd love to hear about it . BROCK DUNNAWAY It concerns itself with the violence of American life  --  the violence that seethes underground everywhere . Have you noticed that the great staple of our literature concerns itself with inherited grievances  --  inherited revenges ? Between individuals  --  between races . My thesis is that our artists  --  since they are the most sensitive of the species  --  inevitably reflect that violence . That is why one of the most distinguished of us was so enraptured by bullfights . Sadism and sex . And all that nonsense about the moment of truth ! There is no moment of truth . There are intimations of truth , but these are achieved by saints and mystics  --  not by bullfighters in tight pants . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Deeply impressed ) I have often thought  --  I hope it wo n't sound pompous  --  but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Yes ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL People talk about disarmament . What 's the good  --  when the individual himself in his heart is not disarmed ? BROCK DUNNAWAY ( Smiles his wintry smile , he feels he has SEYMOUR in his pocket ) Exactly so . Our artists  --  like the public , in general  --  know no tranquility . They know everything about life  --  except how to live . Therefore , they often kill themselves  --  if not overtly  --  by other stealthy means . If they ca n't kill themselves , they kill those around them  --  their wives , their children , whoever . Actually what I am doing is writing a novel about Craig Prosper , whom I knew very well . I was with him you know in Italy at the end I remember an odd incident . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Yes ? BROCK DUNNAWAY We were staying in a little hotel on the Italian Riviera we were sitting in his bedroom . Bottles everywhere . He was drinking like mad . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL What happened ? BROCK DUNNAWAY The little Italian maid came in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very pretty  --  about seventeen , I should say  --  did n't speak a word of English . Craig had no Italian . p. 69 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Formidable obstacle ! BROCK DUNNAWAY Craig had a plastic pencil-sharpener . He showed the girl that . She cooed with delight over it . You might think it was the seventh wonder of the world . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Stuttering ) It 's almost it 's almost one does n't want to hear BROCK DUNNAWAY Oh , but he did n't touch the girl . He did n't go near her . I think she would have screamed and run out if he had . He looked awful  --  bloated and dying and awful . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL What then ? BROCK DUNNAWAY He began making love to her in English . She was busily making the bed and smiling cooperatively . Craig sat in the chair by the window and told her , in English , and very specifically , what he was going to do to her . A fantasy of sex in four-letter words . The girl kept smiling as if Craig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it until the girl left the room . She bobbed her head , said , " Grazie , Signore , buon giorno , Signore , " and left . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL It 's very sad . BROCK DUNNAWAY I do hope , though , you wo n't publish this novel in my lifetime . Because if you do Gilian will shoot me . My way of committing suicide , you see . p. 70 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Struck ) Gilian ? BROCK DUNNAWAY Now , please do n't misunderstand me . Gilian is a very close friend of mine . I love her dearly I find you very sympathetic , Mr. Rosenthal . Not as amusing as your father  --  but more sympathetic . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Absently ) Thank you . BROCK DUNNAWAY That bust of Napoleon . They all worship Napoleon , these tycoons . They forget that their success is often sheer accident . I tell you this , my boy , while Napoleon remains a glamour boy and St. Francis a schnookle there 'll be no hope for the human race . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Kindly ) Brock is my name SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Thank you  --  Brock . We will be most happy to renew your grant . I am sure I can persuade the board . BROCK DUNNAWAY And I am so taken with you that I may even finish it ! ( They both laugh ) Most fiction is utter drivel . Remote from reality . But I know what I 'm writing about . I do n't want to boast about past achievements  --  very tiresome in an old man  --  but I had my days of violence . I am an extinct volcano now , but when I was active p. 71 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Smiles ) Did you ever kill anyone ? BROCK DUNNAWAY ( Smiles back ) I tried ! On one enchanted evening  --  I had had a bad day at my desk  --  I knocked my first wife out cold . It looked bad for her for a time  --  and for me too !  --  I was indicted for assault  --  but fortunately my wife had a wonderful doctor . Not only did he cure her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever after . And my son , thank God , is a nuclear physicist  --  that 's the snug thing to be in our time , do n't you think so ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Disturbed ) Evidently BROCK DUNNAWAY My juiciest character will be Gilian ! SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Really ? BROCK DUNNAWAY She is what the French call an allumeuse . Ignites without satisfying . She does n't sleep with anybody , you know . Just likes to hear about it . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I 'm learning a lot about life ! BROCK DUNNAWAY There 's a great deal to learn , my boy . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL But tell me  --  why do you want to do this ? Why do you want to write this book ? p. 72 BROCK DUNNAWAY ( With his genial smile ) My revenge  --  for being old ! ( MISS SAUNDERS looks in ) NAOMI SAUNDERS A Mr. Lorch to see Mr. Taney . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Has he an appointment ? NAOMI SAUNDERS Yes . He has . I forgot to remind Mr. Taney . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Well , Mr. Taney will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( MISS SAUNDERS disappears ) BROCK DUNNAWAY Another applicant ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Have n't the faintest idea . ( HARRY LORCH comes in . He wears dark glasses . He is a rugged man with touseled hair , sloppily dressed ; he 's just not interested in that sort of thing . He has the broad chest of a man who has spent his life playing wind instruments and the assurance of knowing that he is master of his art . Also he has the confidence of knowing that he can interpret beautifully what is , for him , the greatest art that exists in the world ) SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I am Seymour Rosenthal . This is Mr. Dunnaway . Mr. Taney will be here any minute . HARRY LORCH I have an appointment for four-thirty . ( Looks at his wrist watch ) It 's just four-thirty . When I make an appointment for four-thirty I 'm always there  --  on the dot . p. 73 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Apologetically ) Well you know , Mr. Lorch , traffic HARRY LORCH ( Combatively ) I allow for traffic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? HARRY LORCH I 'm a bassoonist . BROCK DUNNAWAY Ah ! I 'm so pleased . HARRY LORCH What are you pleased about ? BROCK DUNNAWAY That you are something sanitary . HARRY LORCH What made you think I was n't ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Smiles at LORCH ) I do implore you , Mr. Lorch , do not question Mr. Dunnaway too closely ! HARRY LORCH But I want to know what made him think I was one of those  --  what he said BROCK DUNNAWAY ( Dreamily ) Somehow , for a fleeting moment  --  HARRY LORCH ( Hot under the collar ) I do n't know who you are and I do n't care  --  but I can tell you this  --  you 're way off base . BROCK DUNNAWAY ( To SEYMOUR , sadly ) And I pride myself on my observation ! p. 74 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Intervening to protect LORCH ) Please , Mr. Lorch , do n't mind anything Mr. Dunnaway says . His bark is worse than his bite . HARRY LORCH Could n't matter less to me whether he barks or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's four-forty . He 's ten minutes late ! BROCK DUNNAWAY As a musician you are , of course , a slave to time . You live on time , do n't you ? May I ask , Mr. Lorch , what orchestra you play in ? HARRY LORCH I 'm in the orchestra at  --  oh , that show at the Shubert . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Surprised ) The Prosper play ? HARRY LORCH That 's right . That 's where the union put me . BROCK DUNNAWAY Such a sad play , is n't it ? That poor hero  --  his mother had such an effect on him that he 's impotent . It seems to me that all the heroes  --  in all the plays I see  --  are impotent ; and yet offstage the pundits are worried about the population explosion . Paradoxical  --  is n't it ? How do you account for it , Mr. Lorch ? HARRY LORCH Do n't ask me . I have n't seen the play and I do n't want to see it . p. 75 BROCK DUNNAWAY ( Gets up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flatter ourselves that art and literature are vital forces . They are , I have long believed , of very little importance except to the practitioners . The great public is interested only in sex and violence , which they get on television and in movies . HARRY LORCH ( To BROCK ) You 're wrong , wise guy . The house is sold out every night with suckers who like gab . But I tell you this  --  ten bars of Bach are worth more than all the plays on Broadway . BROCK DUNNAWAY Ah , you like Bach ! HARRY LORCH He 's my passion . You sized me up . Now I 'll size you up . BROCK DUNNAWAY Please do . HARRY LORCH I bet you a dollar to a dime you ca n't read a note of music . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Pleased ) You 've met your match , Brock . HARRY LORCH ( Truculent , persists ) Ten to one you ca n't read a Bach score . BROCK DUNNAWAY Well , if it were illustrated I might struggle through it . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell me , is your entire horizon bounded by Bach ? p. 76 HARRY LORCH You 've got me wrong again , smarty . I like Beethoven almost as much as Bach ! BROCK DUNNAWAY ( Enjoying himself  --  LORCH is a natural for him ) How do you feel about the pictorial arts ? HARRY LORCH I can live without ' em . ( CHARLIE comes back . SEYMOUR heaves a sigh of relief . CHARLIE does n't at once notice LORCH . LORCH steps forward ) We had an appointment for four-thirty . It 's twenty minutes to five . CHARLES TANEY ( Remembers ) Oh , of course , Mr. Lorch ! I 'm so sorry . I got tied up in traffic . BROCK DUNNAWAY Mr. Lorch allows for traffic ! CHARLES TANEY ( To LORCH ) I 'm really terribly sorry . Faith has told me so much about you , Mr. Lorch . Mr. Lorch is a bassoonist . BROCK DUNNAWAY We know ! CHARLES TANEY ( To SEYMOUR ) Did n't you offer Mr. Lorch a drink ? HARRY LORCH I do n't drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Taney . CHARLES TANEY Certainly . I look forward to it ! ( To SEYMOUR and BROCK ) That Gilian ! What do you think ? She begged me to get her away from that cocktail party . When I got there she was having such a good time I could n't pry her away with a crowbar . She was with Willard moreover p. 77 HARRY LORCH Faith 's brother ? CHARLES TANEY Yes . They were drinking together and very gay . HARRY LORCH I do n't know who this Gilian is , but if she was making Willard drink she 's not a good influence . CHARLES TANEY That view of Gilian startles me ! Brock , what do you think ? Is Gilian a good influence or not a good influence ? BROCK DUNNAWAY I do n't know whether bad or good , but one thing I do know  --  she is an influence . HARRY LORCH ( Looks at his watch ) I have an appointment at six and I like to be on time . CHARLES TANEY Certainly . ( Almost pleading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute . Do wait in the library . There 's a fire in there . So much pleasanter than this stuffy office . BROCK DUNNAWAY As this charming Mr. Rosenthal has just renewed my grant , I have the leisure to accept your kind invitation . CHARLES TANEY ( Looks at SEYMOUR ) What ? But we decided we would n't ! BROCK DUNNAWAY Mr. Rosenthal is susceptible to charm ! p. 78 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Well , after all , you have the veto . CHARLES TANEY What good is a veto with a push-over like you ! You 're hopeless , Seymour ! BROCK DUNNAWAY ( To LORCH ) So pleased to know you , Mr. Lorch . I have been carefully avoiding Craig 's play , but now I 'll go just to hear you bassoon . HARRY LORCH You wo n't hear it ! BROCK DUNNAWAY Why ? Are you inaudible ? You appear to have so much vitality . HARRY LORCH We do n't play  --  except pinochle . Union rules . BROCK DUNNAWAY Now why ca n't writers have a union like that ? ( As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hand ) There 's no doubt about it , Seymour , if I had my life to live over again I 'd study an instrument . ( BROCK and SEYMOUR go out . CHARLIE faces LORCH . He had forgotten the appointment , and now all he wants is to get it over with ) CHARLES TANEY I 'm sorry you wo n't have a drink , Mr. Lorch . Do you mind if I have one ? I 've had a hard day . HARRY LORCH It 's your bar ! CHARLES TANEY ( He is already there and pouring ) Thank you ! ( Armed with his drink he comes down and faces LORCH ) What can I do for you Mr. Lorch ? p. 79 HARRY LORCH ( With sincerity  --  and a bit pitifully ) You can tell me the truth ! CHARLES TANEY Suppose I do n't know it ! HARRY LORCH ( Ominously ) You know it all right ! CHARLES TANEY If I know it  --  I 'll tell it to you  --  within reason . HARRY LORCH ( He is suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CHARLES TANEY Yes ? HARRY LORCH I 've tried to fight it  --  I 've done my best to fight it  --  but I love Faith . CHARLES TANEY I do n't blame you . She 's lovely . HARRY LORCH Do you love her ? CHARLES TANEY I have great affection for her . HARRY LORCH I asked you  --  do you love her  --  are you in love with her ? CHARLES TANEY At times  --  yes . HARRY LORCH ( Begins to sweat ) I asked you to tell me the truth . CHARLES TANEY I 'm trying . HARRY LORCH You 're either in love with her  --  or you 're not in love with her . Which is it ? p. 80 CHARLES TANEY It 's not as simple as that , Mr. Lorch . It really is n't . My life is very complicated . I 'm very complicated . HARRY LORCH I asked Faith to marry me  --  CHARLES TANEY What did she say ? HARRY LORCH She said that while you 're available and there 's still a chance to get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you ? CHARLES TANEY Why do n't I what ? HARRY LORCH Marry somebody else . CHARLES TANEY Can you suggest anyone ? HARRY LORCH ( Looks around ) Living in a place like this  --  and with your connections  --  it ought to be easy . CHARLES TANEY Forgive me , Mr. Lorch , but it is a most unusual request . HARRY LORCH Tell me this CHARLES TANEY Tell you what ? HARRY LORCH ( He is suffering ) I ca n't ask you . I have n't the nerve to ask you . I feel I have n't the right to ask you . CHARLES TANEY You want to know  --  is she sleeping with me ? p. 81 HARRY LORCH Yes  --  that 's what I want to know . CHARLES TANEY Why do n't you ask Faith ? HARRY LORCH I 'm scared to ask her . Willard says you are . That 's what we had the fight about .

CHARLES TANEY Do all your friends give you black eyes ? Is that why you like them ? HARRY LORCH ( Truculent ) Look , Mr. Taney , I 'm Willard 's best friend and he 's my best friend . CHARLES TANEY But you seem to quarrel . p. 82 HARRY LORCH That was no quarrel . It was just an argument . Willard ca n't quarrel with me . I wo n't let him . If he quarreled with me he would n't have a friend in the world  --  because I 'm his only friend . I ca n't leave him without a friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonishment ) Well , I must say ! HARRY LORCH So tell me right out  --  was Willard telling the truth or was n't he ? Tell me that and I 'll go . CHARLES TANEY ( Sees a way to get rid of him ) Willard was telling you the truth . HARRY LORCH ( Takes out a handkerchief , wipes his forehead ) That 's all I wanted to know . ( A silence ) CHARLES TANEY Did Faith know  --  that you 're coming here ? HARRY LORCH No .

( Smiles ) I keep hearing from Faith  --  about Harry . She 's very devoted to you . p. 83 HARRY LORCH Some devotion ! CHARLES TANEY But she is . HARRY LORCH Are you going to marry Faith ? CHARLES TANEY I think it most unlikely . HARRY LORCH Why do you sleep with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ query  --  to say the least of it  --  is unchivalrous . HARRY LORCH ( Starts to go ) Well , you 've answered my question . Thanks , I suppose . Goodbye . CHARLES TANEY Let 's talk about it a minute . HARRY LORCH What is there to talk about ? I 'm never going to see her again . CHARLES TANEY How intolerant ! Why ? HARRY LORCH Because I 'm not like you . I 'm not in any doubt about whether I love her or do n't love her . I know ! CHARLES TANEY But I 've told you  --  it 's not likely I 'll marry Faith . Keep her friendship . She may then marry you . HARRY LORCH I could n't . I could n't marry her now  --  even if she 'd have me . CHARLES TANEY Why not ? p. 84 HARRY LORCH It 's the way I was brought up , I guess . I could n't marry an immoral girl . CHARLES TANEY Immoral ! What an old-fashioned word . HARRY LORCH To me , Mr. Taney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TANEY Do you consider yourself a moral man , Harry ? HARRY LORCH By and large . Oh , I do n't mean I 've never had anything to do with a woman . I have . But we always knew what it was . I never promised any girl anything beyond just  --  I mean she knew what she was doing and I knew what I was doing . CHARLES TANEY There are all kinds of morality , are n't there ? Forgive me , Harry , but I consider you a most immoral man . HARRY LORCH What do you know about me ? I 've never done anything to anybody . CHARLES TANEY You are a featherbedder . You sit below the stage in a theatre , not playing , not performing any service , pure parasitism , and you have no embarrassment , evidently , at taking pay for doing nothing . I consider that immoral , profoundly immoral . HARRY LORCH But that 's the union . Got nothing to do with me . CHARLES TANEY It has everything to do with you . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 85 HARRY LORCH ( His dander up ) Look , Mr. Taney , I spent years learning to play the bassoon . I worked my head off . I 'm one of the best . If they wanted me to play , I 'd play . I 'm part of the total musical accomplishment of this country and I deserve to be subsidized . Do n't forget  --  we bassoonists have n't got ASCAP . CHARLES TANEY I think Faith is a profoundly moral person  --  one of the few I know . HARRY LORCH After what you just told me  --  how can you say that ? CHARLES TANEY Even in the comparatively trivial realm of sex , Faith is n't immoral  --  she is simply  --  amoral . HARRY LORCH ( Helpless ) What does that mean ? CHARLES TANEY It simply means that Faith does n't accept the code that says sexual indulgence is a sin . To be promiscuous just is n't sinful to her , that 's all . HARRY LORCH If every girl behaved like that what becomes of the family ? CHARLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't give it another thought ! HARRY LORCH Willard told me you 're a terrible man CHARLES TANEY ( Interested ) Oh ? What 's Willard got against me ? p. 86 HARRY LORCH I guess what you 're doing to his sister . CHARLES TANEY Is he in a position , do you think , to be censorious ? HARRY LORCH He 's a wonderful man . He 's got a weakness  --  but he 's a wonderful man . CHARLES TANEY ( With asperity ) Do n't you think , before he criticizes other people , that he should conquer that weakness ? Now mind you , Harry , I am not criticizing him . I believe that everybody should be allowed to go to hell in whatever manner he finds most agreeable . HARRY LORCH ( In wonder ) I ca n't get over it CHARLES TANEY What ? HARRY LORCH That a girl like Faith CHARLES TANEY Well ? HARRY LORCH Should go for a feller like you  --  I ca n't get over it . ( A moment . He broods ) Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHARLES TANEY ( Tries to buck him up ) Not at all . Really , Harry ! Be more flexible . Life is flexible . Things change . It can easily happen  --  I assure you  --  that Faith will switch from a feller like me to a feller like you . She likes you very much . That I know ! p. 87 HARRY LORCH ( Inconsolable ) It 's the first time I ever wanted to marry anybody . First time I was sure . I had such dreams  --  married to Faith . Getting up chamber-music parties . Faith serving drinks and sandwiches to the musicians . All up in smoke ! She likes music , you know , Faith . She understands music . She 's just about  --  perfect . Except for you ! CHARLES TANEY Persevere . Tell her that you know and that you understand . HARRY LORCH But if she 's promiscuous  --  and you said it yourself  --  how do I know some other feller wo n't come along ? CHARLES TANEY You say you love Faith . You are deceiving yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HARRY LORCH We do n't speak the same language . CHARLES TANEY I 'm afraid that 's true . Too bad . ( He goes to the desk , picks up a dossier to convey that he is a busy man ) And now , my dear Harry , I 'm afraid that I really have to get back to work . HARRY LORCH ( Sunk in gloom , looks at his wrist watch ) And I 've got an appointment at six . ( GILIAN comes in ) CHARLES TANEY Oh , Gilian ! This is Mr. Lorch . He 's just leaving . Mrs. Prosper . p. 88 GILIAN PROSPER ( Very warmly ) How do you do ? HARRY LORCH Mrs. Prosper . Are you Faith 's aunt ? GILIAN PROSPER Do I look like an aunt ? HARRY LORCH I know Faith 's mother is dead . GILIAN PROSPER I 'm her stepmother . HARRY LORCH ( Charmed by her ) Why does n't Faith ever bring you around ? GILIAN PROSPER Around where ? HARRY LORCH To my place . For chamber music . GILIAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HARRY LORCH I 'll tell Faith to bring you . ( Looks at his watch ) I 've got an appointment at six . CHARLES TANEY I know ! So have I ! HARRY LORCH ( As he goes  --  in tribute to GILIAN ) That 's a great little girl , Mrs. Prosper . She do n't go for me . She goes for our friend Mr. Taney here . But she 's a great little girl ! She 's a credit to you . GILIAN PROSPER It 's a credit I ca n't honestly claim ! HARRY LORCH Some people are unlucky with their stepchildren , but you 're the exception . p. 89 GILIAN PROSPER ( Accepts the compliment graciously ) Thank you . HARRY LORCH Goodbye , Mr. Taney . CHARLES TANEY Goodbye , Harry . So nice of you to come . ( He sees him , with great relief , out the door ; wipes his forehead and faces GILIAN ) Whew ! GILIAN PROSPER I do n't believe it . I just do n't believe it . Are there such people ? CHARLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em . The salt of the earth , I believe they 're called . And yet you know , Gilian GILIAN PROSPER Well ? CHARLES TANEY ( Decides not to pursue it ) Never mind . Where 's Willard ? GILIAN PROSPER Left me in a huff . CHARLES TANEY ( Lightly ) Lovers ' quarrel ? GILIAN PROSPER ( Equally lightly ) In a way . CHARLES TANEY Why are you seeing so much of Willard ? GILIAN PROSPER For reasons of my own . CHARLES TANEY You beat me ! p. 90 GILIAN PROSPER He hates me . He 's full of hatreds  --  you among them . CHARLES TANEY Oh ? So Harry was saying . What 's he got against me ? GILIAN PROSPER ( Amused ) He despises you . Like his father , he sees everything in symbols . Craig was just mad about symbols . Willard sees you as a symbol . CHARLES TANEY That 's very dignified ! Of what ? GILIAN PROSPER Oh , he says you 're an opportunist and an adventurer . He sees you as a symbol of everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TANEY That 's very flattering ! But does it occur to this profound thinker that if I 'm a symbol of corrupt and meretricious society , then society itself must be corrupt and meretricious ? GILIAN PROSPER Thank you ! I 'll use that on him . I 'm constantly defending you against him . I 'm running out of defenses . CHARLES TANEY ( After a moment ) That fellow Harry  --  he was kind of touching , you know GILIAN PROSPER Was he ? CHARLES TANEY He 's madly in love with Faith . He 's a hick , of course , but rather sweet . He said Faith told him she could n't consider him or anybody while I was  --  " available "  --  his word . And the odd thing is p. 91 GILIAN PROSPER Yes , darling ? CHARLES TANEY I 'm exactly in the same position  --  with you  --  as Harry is with Faith . While you are  --  " available "  --  I ca n't settle down with anybody . GILIAN PROSPER Dear Charlie ! Are you proposing to me ? CHARLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am . GILIAN PROSPER It 's very flattering . I 'm touched . CHARLES TANEY Gilian , listen GILIAN PROSPER ( Smiles at him tenderly ) You 've never , darling boy , had my attention more completely . CHARLES TANEY ( In self-torture ) I 'm sick of being a funny man . I 'm sick of GILIAN PROSPER Do n't tell me you 're going to stop being amusing . It would be a national calamity . What 's the matter with you , Charlie ? CHARLES TANEY ( After a moment  --  close to her  --  with complete sincerity ) I wish you would , Gilian . I really wish you would . We understand each other so well . I think we could have a successful marriage . I really think we could . Say yes  --  so I wo n't have to ask you again . I want no longer to be available . I want to belong to somebody . I want to belong to you . Brock says I 'm trauma-proof . I 'm not . Not quite . I 've never told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . p. 92 GILIAN PROSPER Do . I love to hear things . CHARLES TANEY I adored my father . He was a big , flamboyant , generous man . He spoiled me . He was murdered . Shot in his hotel room . GILIAN PROSPER By whom ? CHARLES TANEY They never found out . That 's why I left Yale . My allowance stopped  --  the day Father stopped . GILIAN PROSPER ( After a pause ) Give me a martini , will you , Charlie ? ( CHARLIE goes to the bar , mixes a drink ) GILIAN PROSPER It 's odd you ask me , Charlie  --  just at this moment . CHARLES TANEY Why is it odd at this moment ? GILIAN PROSPER You know , I 've told you often  --  that I was never going to marry again . CHARLES TANEY I know . But I am such a throbbing opportunity ! GILIAN PROSPER ( Laughs ) You are indeed ! CHARLES TANEY ( Comes to her with a drink ) Grasp it ! Seize it ! Before it vanishes . ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink ) p. 93 GILIAN PROSPER ( Most receptive ) Darling . There 's only one Charles Taney . Now that you 've told me the rest tell me where you got that name . CHARLES TANEY Out of a history book . He was a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court . I thought it was  --  toney . GILIAN PROSPER And so it is ! Toney-Taney ! ( They both laugh ) I do adore you , Charlie , but you could n't have asked me at a worse moment . CHARLES TANEY ( Puzzled ) Why ? GILIAN PROSPER ( Very deliberately ) Because , as it happens , I am thinking of getting married . CHARLES TANEY ( Stunned ) Really ? GILIAN PROSPER Really . CHARLES TANEY To whom ? GILIAN PROSPER Seymour Rosenthal . ( A silence . He stares at her in incredulous astonishment ) I think I 'd be ever so much better for Seymour  --  than your Doctor Greer . CHARLES TANEY You 're surely not serious ! GILIAN PROSPER Why not ? I 've been seeing him . I like him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual . In my experience certainly . He is a saint . A crippled saint . Having been married to a devil it might be amusing , might n't it , to be married to a saint ? ( A silence . He stares and stares at her ) I know . It 's startling . But is n't it rather  --  cozy . ( A silence . He is devastated . She sees it ) You 're really disappointed , are n't you ? I 'm touched , dear Charlie . I really am . I did n't know your feeling for me  --  was so profound . ( The telephone rings . CHARLIE goes to answer it ) p. 94 CHARLES TANEY ( On the telephone ) Oh , Faith . Oh , sure  --  I was just going to call you let 's meet at the restaurant yes , I did I took it up with Seymour about Willard  --  he turned it down I 'm terribly sorry  --  I did what I could but he 's my boss , after all I know I know how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll tell you just what he said . ( He hangs up ) GILIAN PROSPER Was she disappointed ? CHARLES TANEY Terribly . Her brother means more to her than anybody , I think . GILIAN PROSPER Was she terribly disappointed ? CHARLES TANEY Devastated . GILIAN PROSPER Did Seymour turn him down ? CHARLES TANEY I decide and I 'm not going to give a grant to a psychotic who goes around panning me . I have to live up to the  --  symbolic value he attaches to me . GILIAN PROSPER That 's a nice arrangement between you and Seymour . He can blame rejections on you and you can blame them on him . ( She gets up to go into the library ) Who 's in there with Seymour ? p. 95 CHARLES TANEY ( Absently ) Brock Dunnaway . GILIAN PROSPER ( Pleased ) That aging wasp . I love him . The more he insults me the more I love him . I 'll ask him to have dinner with us . ( As she starts out ) Why do n't you ditch Faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PROSPER It would be such an agreeable foursome . CHARLES TANEY Ca n't . GILIAN PROSPER ( Pauses on her way ) You 're not angry with me  --  are you , Charlie ? I could n't bear it if you were . CHARLES TANEY ( He is seething with anger ) Why should I be angry ? The more I think of it  --  you and Seymour  --  the more  --  beguiling  --  it seems . GILIAN PROSPER ( In triumph ) I told you ! It 's only startling  --  when it first hits you . ( She laughs . She is at the door ) CHARLES TANEY Ask Seymour to come in to see me for a minute , will you ? GILIAN PROSPER I will . That 'll leave me alone with Brock . I 'll be a pincushion of poisoned darts But I can trust you , ca n't I , Charlie ? You wo n't tell Seymour my designs on him ? ( CHARLIE shakes his head ) I know I can trust you . If not you  --  who ? ( GILIAN goes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar , abstractedly mixes himself another drink . SEYMOUR comes in ) p. 96 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Yes , Charlie ? CHARLES TANEY Wanted a minute with you SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Awfully sorry you ca n't have dinner with us , Charlie . Gilian says you 're busy . CHARLES TANEY ( Walks away from the bar , abstracted ) That 's right . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Anything wrong ? CHARLES TANEY No . Why ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Smiles at him ) You do n't seem your usual gay self ! CHARLES TANEY It 's that I 'm a bit troubled about this grant to Willard Prosper . The more I think of it  --  the more I think it would be a mistake . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I 'm sorry you feel that way . I 'm greatly taken with the idea . CHARLES TANEY You 've renewed Brock 's grant . That was a mistake . I do n't want to compound it with another ! SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Could n't we read what Willard has written and then decide ? CHARLES TANEY It 's probably good  --  even if it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been inquiring around about Willard , and he 's absolutely no good . No character . p. 97 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Did Gilian say anything ? CHARLES TANEY ( Dryly ) Plenty . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Impressed ) Well , she 's very keen . CHARLES TANEY Keen ! She 's clairvoyant ! SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Hate to turn down Craig Prosper 's son . Still  --  if you definitely think not CHARLES TANEY I definitely think not ! SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Well , that settles it , does n't it ? After all  --  you 're the boss . ( GILIAN comes back ) GILIAN PROSPER Seymour , I 'm starved  --  and Brock 's out of insults SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Smiling ) May I go , boss ? CHARLES TANEY ( Smiles back ) You may go . ( SEYMOUR turns to GILIAN , who is in wonderful humor . As they start out , CHARLIE is standing at his desk , brooding over what GILIAN has told him . The lights dim. ) p. 98 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO Scene : The same . Several days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking around the room . She is very nervous . She has an appointment with SEYMOUR . He comes in , a bit flurried . He carries WILLARD 'S unfinished manuscript . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Miss Prosper I 'm terribly sorry I hope I have n't kept you waiting . FAITH PROSPER Only a few minutes ( Smiles to cover her anxiety ) It only seemed long because I knew you were reading my brother 's book and I 'm terribly  --  nervous . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I adore it . It 's exquisite . FAITH PROSPER ( Overcome ) Really ? Really ! SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I have always been interested in the period of the French Revolution . ( Goes to the desk , puts the manuscript on it ) I wanted to like it very much as your brother is the son of one of my heroes . I was n't disappointed it 's delightfully written . It 's penetrating . And , most satisfying of all  --  FAITH PROSPER ( Agog ) Yes ? p. 99 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL It takes a wit to write about Chamfort , and your brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strachey . More feeling than Strachey . Your brother must finish this because ( He smiles at her ) Oh , I know what happened to poor Chamfort . But your brother must finish it because I ca n't wait to read it . FAITH PROSPER You mean then ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Tell your brother that the Foundation will be honored to give him a grant . Honored . ( FAITH ca n't stand it . She turns away ) What 's the matter ? Are you all right ? FAITH PROSPER ( Her back to him ) I 'm trying not to cry ! SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Do you feel like crying ? FAITH PROSPER I 'm afraid it 's too late . ( She sniffles into her handkerchief ) SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Smiles ) When I feel like crying I indulge myself . I cry . When I 'm alone , of course FAITH PROSPER But I 'm not alone ! SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Starts to go ) I 'll go have a good cry . Then come upstairs and I 'll give you a cup of tea . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was happiness . I ca n't possibly tell you what this means to me , Mr. Rosenthal . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Factually  --  to give her a chance to get control of herself ) I gave the copy to Brock to read . Not for corroboration . For fun . Brock adored it . He says your brother writes far better than your father did . Brock was captivated by the style . Stylistically your father was n't much , was he ? All dynamic energy and furious indignation . No repose in him , was there ? FAITH PROSPER ( Assailed by doubt suddenly ) Are you sure ? May I tell Willard ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Of course . I 'll tell him myself . FAITH PROSPER ( After a moment , a prayer uttered aloud to herself ) Thank God I did it . Thank God ! SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Did what ? FAITH PROSPER Went over Charlie 's head . Sent the manuscript to you . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Surprised ) Has n't Charlie read it ? FAITH PROSPER ( Bitterness showing ) He 's far too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down . p. 101 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Startled ) Did he ? How could I have turned it down when I had n't read it ? FAITH PROSPER He said you had . Something  --  I do n't know what  --  made me not believe him . Thank God I did n't believe him ! SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Charlie could n't have meant it . You must have misunderstood him . FAITH PROSPER You 're the boss , he said , and you 'd turned thumbs down on it . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Well , Charlie is the boss . He runs the Foundation . FAITH PROSPER ( Troubled again ) Well if he 's the boss and he just does n't want this ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I 'll have to clear it with Charlie , of course , but I 'm sure it 'll be all right . FAITH PROSPER I 'm not at all sure . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL He 's the decentest , kindest fellow in the world . I have reason to know  --  from personal experience . Once he 's read it  --  I 'm sure he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ) as I was ! FAITH PROSPER He 's awfully angry at me , you know . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Why ? p. 102 FAITH PROSPER For doing this . For sending the manuscript to you . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Oh well , we 'll save his face . I 'll make him read it . I 'll pretend to wait for his verdict . FAITH PROSPER And supposing he still does n't ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Dear Miss Prosper . I will write your brother a letter  --  this afternoon , confirming what I have just told you . I 'm sure Charlie will see it my way . FAITH PROSPER It 's terribly complicated SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Is it ? FAITH PROSPER Well  --  you know  --  Charlie and I  --  SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I know . FAITH PROSPER We had our first bitter quarrel  --  over this . And you know , Mr. Rosenthal it was strange SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Please call me by my first name FAITH PROSPER May I ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Please FAITH PROSPER It was our first bitter quarrel  --  and in the course of it SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see Charlie in a different light . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Oh ? FAITH PROSPER A lot came out . A great deal came out . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Taps the manuscript on the table ) But he spoke to me about this . He asked me to consider it . I do n't quite see FAITH PROSPER Something must have happened since SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Have you any idea what ? FAITH PROSPER No . I 'm quite at sea . One thing did occur to me though it 's so fantastic that SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL What ? FAITH PROSPER It came out  --  in the course of our quarrel  --  SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Helps her over the halts ) Yes ? FAITH PROSPER It came out at last . He said it at last  --  what I 've long suspected but could n't bring myself to acknowledge ( SEYMOUR says nothing , listens ) that it 's Gilian he loves . That it 's Gilian he wants . I was glad  --  at last  --  to have it come out into the open . I have to face it . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's over between me and Charlie . ( She faces him ) I tell you , Mr. Ro  --  Seymour , if I can save Willard  --  if he can give up that miserable job and devote himself to finishing this book  --  to the work that I know he can do  --  it 's all I care about . I have lived all this time in the terror  --  ( He says nothing . He is affected . He listens ) that Willard would do  --  what his brother did what Father did p. 104 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Very quiet ) Can you get your brother on the telephone ? I 'll speak to him . I 'll tell him to quit his job . FAITH PROSPER I ca n't get him at the store . But we 're having dinner together . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I am free this evening . If you would both care to join me after dinner FAITH PROSPER I have to go to the theatre And I know that Willard SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Feels he has been too intrusive ) It was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FAITH PROSPER I know that Willard 's meeting Gilian . This worries me too . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Why ? FAITH PROSPER There is hatred there . And that 's what I meant just now . About Charlie . It occurred to me that he resents Willard  --  because he 's seeing so much of Gilian SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Very keen ) Is that why it worries you ? FAITH PROSPER It 's deeper than that Seymour SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Yes ? p. 105 FAITH PROSPER I feel you are a friend . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I should try to be . FAITH PROSPER Willard sometimes talks wildly . About the " act " he calls it . About involvement . Commitment . For him , Gilian is the embodiment of evil . Charlie too . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Surprised ) Charlie too ? FAITH PROSPER Yes . Do n't ask me to explain . I do n't pretend to chart the workings of Willard 's mind . Any more than I could Father 's There 's only Willard left to me now  --  and my brother 's children . I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose I sound  --  quite irrational ! SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Simply ) I sympathize . FAITH PROSPER I 've suffered all my life  --  under this dark burden . It 's a kind of curse  --  an inherited curse . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Inherited ? FAITH PROSPER Yes . Inherited . You say you adored my father . I understand that . It is because you did n't belong to him . I have often thought  --  oh , if only I did n't know my father  --  if he were a stranger  --  and I could worship him from afar ! ( She is frightened suddenly that she is jeopardizing WILLARD 's case ) I should n't be telling you these things . It will prejudice you against Willard . I 'm crazy to be doing it . p. 106 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( With strength ) But you are quite wrong ! FAITH PROSPER ( More lightly ) We are a kind of Jukes family , you see  --  highly literate  --  and even creative . But a Jukes family still ! My father 's works are famous all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pittance Willard and I can earn  --  would be in a foundling home . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Does Gilian get it all ? FAITH PROSPER She gets it all . ( A pause . SEYMOUR feels he has looked into an abyss  --  he broods aloud ) SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Brock says that we all live to revenge ourselves on somebody for something . To get even . It 's a chilling view of life , is n't it ? FAITH PROSPER I suppose it 's true . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Still thinking aloud ) It takes different forms with different people , does n't it ? FAITH PROSPER ( She understands what he means . Warmly ) Your way is a blessing ! SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( With self-excoriation ) I can afford my way ! But supposing I could n't afford it ? p. 107 FAITH PROSPER You 'd have done something else  --  equally kind , equally  --  beneficent . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I wonder FAITH PROSPER ( Close to him , she adores him ) I 'm sure . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Musing over what FAITH has revealed ) The eternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to administer a general anesthetic to the entire human race . I 'm not quite as defeatist as that . Are you ? FAITH PROSPER ( Smiles at him ) Not since I know you ! ( CHARLIE comes in . His manner is , as usual , casual and flippant , but inside he is seething with anger . He feels savage , murderous . He goes at once to the bar and starts to make himself a drink ) SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Hello , Charlie . FAITH PROSPER Hello , Charlie . CHARLES TANEY Greetings ! Drink anybody ? FAITH PROSPER No , thank you , Charlie . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL No , thank you , Charlie . CHARLES TANEY ( His usual manner  --  ironic jocularity ) I must brace myself for the tremendous conflict of authority which I feel impending ! ( Comes forward with a drink in his hand  --  to SEYMOUR ) Who could ever have imagined that Faith  --  of all people , Faith  --  would come between you and me ! And in the wrong way ! If it were sex that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But interfering with my authority . Really , Faith  --  really ! ( It does n't quite get over , but they do their best to accept him as funny ) p. 108 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Most conciliating ) There seems to have been some sort of misunderstanding . ( He smiles at CHARLIE ) Faith is confused as to who 's boss . CHARLES TANEY So am I ! SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Miss Prosper , I imagine , did n't want to take advantage of your personal friendship . She therefore sent her brother 's manuscript to me  --  ( He smiles ) to get the objective opinion of  --  an outsider . CHARLES TANEY For God 's sake , Seymour , after all these years , do we have to be diplomatic with each other ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I 've read it , Charlie . It 's lovely . You read it . You 'll agree . CHARLES TANEY I do n't read fragments . If it 's lovely why does n't Willard finish it ? FAITH PROSPER ( To CHARLIE ) You know perfectly well Willard has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of research to do . You know all that perfectly well . CHARLES TANEY He has plenty of time for other diversions , has n't he ? FAITH PROSPER What do you mean by that ? CHARLES TANEY Look , Faith . I did n't ask for this . You asked for it . I 've discussed this with you frankly . I now have to be equally frank about Willard with Seymour . I do n't like to do it , but it 's not my doing  --  it 's your doing . You have acted  --  as the big guys say at the UN  --  unilaterally  --  and you leave me no choice . p. 109 FAITH PROSPER You have a prejudice against Willard . What is it based on ? CHARLES TANEY ( To SEYMOUR ) For one thing , he 's an alcoholic . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Mildly ) But , Charlie ! If we condemned works of art because of lapses like that on the part of their authors we 'd be greatly impoverished , would n't we ? CHARLES TANEY ( Loses his temper a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't he quit drinking for a while and quit socializing and settle down to work and offer his book to a regular publisher ? Why does he pester us ? ( He takes a deep swallow of his drink ) I did n't ask for this , Faith . You did . FAITH PROSPER What did you mean by " socializing " ? CHARLES TANEY You know what I meant . He has plenty of time to go around wooing his step-mother is what I meant . FAITH PROSPER ( Sharply ) I thought possibly that that is what you meant ! CHARLES TANEY He goes around town panning me  --  panning this Foundation , which I represent . If he is so contemptuous of what we 're doing , why does he apply to us for help ? p. 110 FAITH PROSPER He 's not applying . I 'm applying . His book is applying . CHARLES TANEY Seymour has so far kept up the polite fiction that I am running the Foundation . I 'm the boss , he says . As the boss , I am turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faith , but I find your brother personally repellent . I do n't believe he has either the character or the stamina to finish this book . That is my last word on the subject . Except to say that I do n't think it gentlemanly of you to have put me in a position where I had to say these things in front of Seymour ! ( There is a silence . FAITH turns to SEYMOUR ) FAITH PROSPER Charlie has made his position clear . What is your position ? ( SEYMOUR is shocked by what CHARLIE has said ; he is an agony of disillusionment which he ca n't bear to accept . His faint stutter becomes more pronounced ) SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Quietly ) Your brother is going to get the grant . CHARLES TANEY ( Decides to frighten SEYMOUR ) In that case you 'll have to get yourself another director . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Without lifting his voice ) In that case I 'll get one . ( This shocks CHARLIE  --  it is the first time in their history that SEYMOUR has contradicted him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you mean that , Seymour . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL You said quite a few things , dear Charlie , which are untenable . CHARLES TANEY For instance ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL For instance  --  that Willard is personally repellent to you . What has that got to do with it ? CHARLES TANEY ( His voice rises ) I tell you he goes around town panning us . Panning the Foundation . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL That 's his privilege . It has nothing whatever to do with the issue . CHARLES TANEY The funds at our disposal are not limitless . If we waste them on projects that will never be finished what will be left for decent , hard-working writers working on non-commercial books which they will finish ? You are penalizing the decent ones to coddle the obscene ones . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Increasingly pained ) There 's nothing obscene in this book , Charlie . You are talking about a book you have n't even read . CHARLES TANEY I am talking about an author whom I know and you do n't . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Stumbles it out ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's discuss it . You are under some sort of strain evidently . Your attitude in this  --  is not  --  characteristic . p. 112 CHARLES TANEY Since college we 've known each other  --  and this is the first time SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I think that is a tribute to our friendship , do n't you ? That it is the first time ( The telephone rings . CHARLIE takes the call ) CHARLES TANEY ( On the telephone ) Yes , Gilian I 'm in a meeting with Seymour I guess I could . In fact  --  to tell you the truth  --  I welcome this interruption . I 'll be right over . ( He hangs up . To SEYMOUR ) Gilian sends her love . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Thank you . CHARLES TANEY ( Goes back to the table ) All right  --  I 'll read the God-damn thing ! ( He has resumed his customary bantering manner  --  to FAITH ) Did you think , Faith , that you could be powerful enough to make Seymour and me quarrel for the first time in our lives ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I apologize for what I said about your brother . Would you deny me my little prejudices ? They wo n't last long . You know that . I 'm flexible and I 'm tolerant . ( To SEYMOUR ) I 'll call you tonight , Seymour  --  after I 've read it . p. 113 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Good ! You 'll be enchanted , I think . CHARLES TANEY ( As he begins to go , he stops  --  he wants to hurt FAITH ) By the way , Seymour , did I tell you ? Let me be the first to congratulate you . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Quite in the dark ) On what ? CHARLES TANEY Gilian is going to marry you . She expressed the intention . And when Gilian expresses an intention it presently becomes a reality . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I 'm very set up ! CHARLES TANEY Who would n't be ! I 'd be ! She always wanted my cook . She 's got my cook . ( CHARLIE goes . A silence between FAITH and SEYMOUR . She goes to him ) FAITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't I ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Automatically  --  he is in a terrible turmoil over the revelation he has had of his idol ) You can ! FAITH PROSPER You see , I 'm so worried about Willard  --  he 's terribly nervous  --  disturbed . I live in the fear SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Yes ? p. 114 FAITH PROSPER That he 'll go over the line . Sometimes I SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Yes ? FAITH PROSPER He talks so wildly . I hope when you meet him that you wo n't misunderstand . He 's harsh sometimes , and his harshness repels people , but I can tell you this  --  he is dear he is honest he is good . His need of love  --  his longing for love  --  is great . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( With a gesture toward the manuscript ) I can tell from his book . FAITH PROSPER I ca n't tell you what this means  --  not the money alone but the reassurance . It may save him . I bless you . ( A pause ) I 've talked too much . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing ) I am sorry to have caused this rift  --  between you and Charlie . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Desperately denying what he knows to be true ) Oh , no  --  it 's not a rift  --  it ca n't be  --  we 've been through too much together  --  Charlie and I for a  --  ( Grasps at a straw , brightens ) Did n't you notice  --  at the end  --  he veered a bit ? Trust me  --  to win him over . p. 115 FAITH PROSPER I do . I trust you . More than anyone else in the world  --  I trust you ! ( Another pause . Finally ) Goodbye . ( She reaches out her hand . He takes it ) SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Goodbye . FAITH PROSPER Thank you . Thank you very much . ( Their hands are still clasped in their farewell handshake ) Before I go  --  I have to say  --  I feel I have to say ( She stumbles for words ) That it is reassuring  --  to meet someone  --  who has some feeling  --  some sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer "  --  she ca n't ) SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Quietly ) I have very little to offer  --  but , if I had  --  I would offer it to you . ( She is startled , touched . Impulsively she lifts his hand , which she is still holding , to her lips and kisses it . She runs out of the room . He stands looking after her ) @x Scene : The same . Eleven o'clock at night , several weeks later . At rise : CHARLIE , in a dinner jacket , and with a flower in his buttonhole , is talking on the telephone to Doctor Greer . CHARLES TANEY Oh , Alvin I 'm glad I got you since Seymour wo n't keep a date with you , why do n't you come over here ? Believe it or not he 's giving a chamber-music party Since the mountain wo n't come to Mohamet Well , if you love chamber music , so much the better Oh sure , Gilian , Faith , her brother , everybody Ca n't you chuck that ? Try , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like but come ! ( As he hangs up , GILIAN and HARRY come in . Without the dark glasses we see that HARRY has fine eyes . His dinner jacket is a bit seedy , but he is now in his element , bringing chamber music to the Philistines . He displays the masterfulness of a crusader preaching God to the heathens . GILIAN is in a stunning Dior and looks radiant . She is in marvelous fettle ) GILIAN PROSPER Hello , Charlie ! Met Harry on the sidewalk . Was n't I lucky ? HARRY LORCH ( Beams with pleasure ) That luck is mutual . p. 117 GILIAN PROSPER Thank you , dear Harry . CHARLES TANEY ( On the way to the bar ) I know Harry does n't drink . What 'll you have , Gilian ? GILIAN PROSPER Champagne , I think , Charlie . HARRY LORCH ( Emboldened  --  to GILIAN ) It seems kind of funny to like your girl 's mother the way I like you . GILIAN PROSPER ( Smiles at him ) I find you very sympathetic , Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sympathetic with you . GILIAN PROSPER When I get back from Europe I hope to see a lot you . CHARLES TANEY ( With a sharp look at her  --  comes from the bar , gives her a glass of champagne ) Europe ? When did you decide that , Gilian ? GILIAN PROSPER Yesterday . HARRY LORCH ( Released now to gaiety ) It 's a shame you 're going to Europe , just as we 're getting chummy . CHARLES TANEY Good point , Harry ! Work on her . GILIAN PROSPER ( To HARRY ) I 'll call you when I get back . Then we can resume where we left off . p. 118 HARRY LORCH ( In full flirtation ) Well , with you going away , how will we get the time to get to the place where we can leave off from ? GILIAN PROSPER But , Harry ! You are very amusing ! CHARLES TANEY ( To HARRY ) Are you going to play tonight ? HARRY LORCH Sure . Second violin . CHARLES TANEY Thought you were a bassoonist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dime a dozen , so I switched to the bassoon . CHARLES TANEY Suppose the union hears about it ? HARRY LORCH The union wo n't mind because we 're playing for nothing . CHARLES TANEY ( To GILIAN ) Paradox , is n't it ? When Harry does n't play  --  at the theatre  --  he insists on being paid . When he does play , it 's for free . How do you explain it ? HARRY LORCH Because I love chamber music . GILIAN PROSPER So do I. I ca n't tell you , Harry , how pleased I am to be here tonight . ( SEYMOUR comes in , elegant in his perfect dinner jacket . He looks at GILIAN approvingly ) p. 119 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Hello , Gilian . ( As he takes in her dress ) Very decorative . GILIAN PROSPER Thank you , darling . HARRY LORCH Oh , Mr. Rosenthal , could I just go up to your place for a minute and see that the music stands and the lights are okay ? And I 've got to sort out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? HARRY LORCH Well , that would be a help just for a minute . As it 's your apartment , you know the ropes . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Smiles ) I hope so . By the way , Mr. Lorch , about the food : what do musicians like to eat ? HARRY LORCH They like sandwiches . Big sandwiches . They like pickles . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Well , I think perhaps my cook can do better than that by them . HARRY LORCH They do n't like fancy . They like sandwiches  --  corned beef , tongue and pastrami . GILIAN PROSPER Can your cook be as primitive as that , Seymour ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL She 's adaptable . All right , Harry ? HARRY LORCH Fine . ( SEYMOUR and HARRY go out ) p. 120 CHARLES TANEY When are you going to Europe ? GILIAN PROSPER Sailing Wednesday . CHARLES TANEY Paris ? GILIAN PROSPER Stockholm . CHARLES TANEY Oh ? Craig 's play ? GILIAN PROSPER Yes . CHARLES TANEY Mind if I come along  --  to Stockholm ? GILIAN PROSPER Oh , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means you 're taking someone else . GILIAN PROSPER Yes . CHARLES TANEY Who ? GILIAN PROSPER Seymour . CHARLES TANEY Have you asked him yet ? GILIAN PROSPER Not yet . That 's why I 'd like you  --  when he comes back  --  to leave us alone for a bit . CHARLES TANEY I do n't want to discourage you , but I 've found out something that may perhaps affect your program . GILIAN PROSPER What 's that ? CHARLES TANEY Seymour 's taken by Faith . Is n't that odd ? He 's got a thing on Faith . p. 121 GILIAN PROSPER Darling ! Have you lost all confidence in me ? CHARLES TANEY ( Studies her a moment ) No . No . I 've never doubted that if you 've set your mind on something  --  you 'll get it . And after all GILIAN PROSPER Well ? CHARLES TANEY If you are determined to marry somebody , Seymour 'd be better for me than anybody else . ( GILIAN tinkles a little laugh ) There 've been irritations you know lately  --  between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said nothing to me . CHARLES TANEY As you know he 's never questioned anything I 've ever done . GILIAN PROSPER Seymour 's a natural hero-worshiper and you have always been his hero . CHARLES TANEY There 's been a rift in the lute . About a grant for Willard . I do n't want to give it to him . Seymour does . GILIAN PROSPER Assert your authority . Do n't give in . To give in is fatal . CHARLES TANEY He 's stubborn about it . GILIAN PROSPER ( Sips her champagne ) You be more stubborn . p. 122 CHARLES TANEY I am not , you know , in your Olympian position . GILIAN PROSPER ( Quietly ) Go on the assumption that you are . Everything in life is courage . Everything in life is not to be afraid . ( SEYMOUR comes back . He is feeling happy ) SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL One of those musicians really knows pictures ! He appreciated my pictures . CHARLES TANEY ( To GILIAN ) See how happy he is ! The collector 's beam ! SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artists without being told ! CHARLES TANEY Do n't you think I ought to go up to see that they do n't steal any ? ( GILIAN and SEYMOUR laugh ) Oh , Seymour , I 've invited Doctor Greer . He can make you comfortable on a couch and analyze you while Harry and his colleagues are playing Schubert ! SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Ideal conditions ! ( CHARLIE goes into his bedroom . There is a brief pause between GILIAN and SEYMOUR ) GILIAN PROSPER I adore Harry , do n't you ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Warmly ) I like him very much . p. 123 GILIAN PROSPER He has the perennial appeal of innocence . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Somewhat ruefully ) Do n't I have that appeal ? GILIAN PROSPER ( Definitely ) Your appeal is quite different ! ( SEYMOUR is a bit embarrassed by this  --  GILIAN helps him out ) Why do n't you have some of Charlie 's champagne ? It 's very good champagne . And I would n't mind another drop myself . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Delighted to be employed ) Certainly ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass . She smiles up at him ) GILIAN PROSPER You 're very handsome . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( A bit embarrassed ) Thank you . I always considered myself well  --  rather  --  ( He was about to say " unattractive " ) GILIAN PROSPER Yes ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Shall I tell you ? GILIAN PROSPER Please ! SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL You intimidate me . I do n't feel entirely comfortable with you . p. 124 GILIAN PROSPER I feel entirely comfortable with you . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL There are people I feel I understand . Faith , for instance . But I have no notion of what you really are , what you want , what you believe in . GILIAN PROSPER It is a great advantage sometimes , do n't you think so , Seymour , not to know exactly what one is doing ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL You make me feel hopelessly nave . " Square , " I believe they call it . GILIAN PROSPER And yet you 're scarcely likely to meet anyone who will be as frank with you  --  as I am prepared to be . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you seeing Willard ? What do you want from Willard ? GILIAN PROSPER Why do n't you ask Willard what he wants from me ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL He blames you for his brother 's suicide . GILIAN PROSPER I know , I know . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Willard is a very disturbed man . Faith is frightened . Are n't you ? GILIAN PROSPER I am afraid of nothing . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Does n't that show  --  a lack of imagination ? p. 125 GILIAN PROSPER But I 'm not imaginative . I have no wish to be . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( With passion ) They have a grievance  --  Faith and Willard . They have a just grievance . Why do n't you help them ? Why do n't you make friends of them ? You could easily . GILIAN PROSPER You say that because you are imaginative . ( With no trace of feeling  --  lightly ) I could never be friends with them . They hate me  --  as their father did . Also SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Well ? GILIAN PROSPER Willard loves me  --  as his father did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are facts , dear Seymour , and no amount of imagination will change them . And shall I tell you something else ? I love Willard  --  as I did his father . He is the image of his father . And when I get rid of him  --  I will have gotten rid of all of them . You say you do n't know what I want . This is what I want . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL How do you mean to do it  --  to get rid of him ? GILIAN PROSPER ( Lightly ) Since I have no imagination I allow for the improvisation of life . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Half to himself ) It is a morass a swamp  --  a morass of evil . p. 126 GILIAN PROSPER But of course What else ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Baffling GILIAN PROSPER Of course . What else ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Again with passion ) Surely life is more than improvisation  --  surely there is such a thing as will  --  and even good will  --  to steer the improvisation into some ( He stops ; she helps him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . The vista  --  even if not the paradise . GILIAN PROSPER I do not long for paradise . Not even for a vista of it . I enjoy the facts of life . I am pleased with the facts of my own nature . I do n't know all of them and I am in no hurry to find out . This adventure with Willard amuses me no end . The first time I met him he was eighteen and he came to kill me . He remained to make love to me . Well  --  is n't that  --  interesting ? And it 's still the same with him . He wants to possess me and he wants to kill me . Similar emotions , are n't they ? ( He says nothing . He stares at her ) I believe I shock you . I do n't want to . I want to please you . I want to interest you . I am very devoted to you , Seymour . I like you no end . But , darling I am going to tell you something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it  --  a risk of alienating you . But then  --  I enjoy danger  --  or I would n't be seeing Willard. p. 127 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Are n't there enough natural dangers in life  --  death itself  --  without going out of your way to court them ? GILIAN PROSPER But I do n't go out of my way ! Dangers  --  and other excitements  --  come to me . After all , it was right here in this room , on these scholarly premises , that I ran into Willard . Actually , I am very sedentary . ( She looks at him ; he is deeply troubled ) I adore you , Seymour . You 're a good man . ( With sudden revelation ) You know  --  it 's just struck me  --  that 's a novelty ! ( They are both laughing . She holds out her empty glass ) Fill it . ( He takes the glass , goes to the bar , fills it , brings it back . A moment ) I 'm a bit tight . Are you ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Omnipotent . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Wo n't go as far as that . But I must admit  --  a little less inhibited than usual GILIAN PROSPER With you I 'm not inhibited at all . Do you know how I was first  --  gainfully employed ? ( He says nothing ) Posing in the nude for pornographic films . It was in one of those films shown at a stag-party in Chicago that my first husband saw me . He was an artist and he saw possibilities . I became his model and then his wife . ( Pause . SEYMOUR is not shocked ; he is saddened . It enlists him for GILIAN , as she knew it would ) Do n't tell Charlie that . It would n't shock him . Nothing could shock Charlie . It would just annoy him that I told you something I would n't tell him ! ( SEYMOUR gets up . His face is grave . He looks down at her ) p. 128 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Poor Gilian ! Poor child ! GILIAN PROSPER It 's odd my telling you that . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly discovering things about myself . It 's really rather fun . When I met Willard here the other day  --  when I found that he remembered that before I sent him to jail I kissed him  --  I felt a kind of thrill . Now is n't that odd ? Vanity , I suppose . Sexual vanity . But you know what I discover lately  --  sex bores me . Too much fuss made about it altogether . What I want now , darling , is tranquility  --  and grace . ( She looks at him . How tight is he ? What is his mood exactly ? How far can she go ? ) SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I 've always been ashamed of being rich . The story you just told me makes me more ashamed . GILIAN PROSPER I love being rich . Between us  --  we could be richer . You could indulge your good works to the limit . I do n't in the least believe in them , but I 'd be tolerant . It 's a charming eccentricity  --  this benefaction of yours . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the vista of degradation her story has revealed ) SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Appalled  --  as if to himself ) What kind of society is it  --  that forced you to that ? p. 129 GILIAN PROSPER It 's a good society . What 's wrong with it ? That film was a first cause which led eventually to Craig  --  and to my being asked , this very evening , to your house to listen to chamber music . It provides a wide margin for adventure  --  our society  --  and I like that ! ( A pause , she sips her champagne ) I am feeling wonderfully cozy and happy and generally swell . How do you feel ? ( She smiles at him . Out of his preoccupation , he smiles back ) SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL At sixes and sevens . GILIAN PROSPER ( After a moment ) Seymour SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Absently ) Yes ? GILIAN PROSPER You may be right , you know SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL About what ? GILIAN PROSPER About Willard . I should , perhaps , stop seeing Willard . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish you would ! GILIAN PROSPER I 've reached that decision myself . I ca n't stop seeing him if I 'm here . He pesters me  --  and I pester him . I 've decided , therefore , to go away . p. 130 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Oh ? GILIAN PROSPER Craig wrote a play  --  a play just for me he said at the time . I have the only manuscript . I sent it to a theatre man in Stockholm who is a great friend of mine . I am going over to see the world premiere . Why do n't you come with me ? Would n't it be fun ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL That 's very flattering would n't I bore you ? GILIAN PROSPER The moment you bored me I 'd send you home . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL When do you plan to go ? GILIAN PROSPER Right away . The Drottingholm on the fourteenth . That 's next Wednesday . Such a nice boat . I took it with Craig when he went to get the Nobel Prize . I hate flying , do n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something constructive for FAITH . She is aware of it and uses it ) Very tempting . I 've never been to Stockholm . GILIAN PROSPER ( Smiling at him ) Do n't say anything to anybody . I 'll book you a cabin . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL You 're sure you want me ? GILIAN PROSPER I am so sure that if you refuse I wo n't go myself . I 'll keep up this dreary roundelay with Willard and God knows what will happen . Do come . Do get me out of this awful cat-and-mouse game with Willard . ( SEYMOUR looks at her a moment ) p. 131 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Finally ) I 'll come ! GILIAN PROSPER I ca n't tell you  --  what a relief it will be for me ! ( BROCK comes in . He looks elegant and distinguished and spruced up in his dinner jacket ) GILIAN PROSPER ( Greets him ) My dearest enemy ! ( BROCK goes to her , bends over her hand , kisses it ) BROCK DUNNAWAY My precious target . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I am so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never refuse invitations  --  from benefactors ! It 's so nice , for once , not to see Gilian at a funeral . GILIAN PROSPER It 's true , you know , I 'm always running into Brock at funerals . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Whose ? GILIAN PROSPER This morning  --  Clyde Enright 's and last week at whose was it , Brock ? BROCK DUNNAWAY I forget . But you know  --  I was really very fond of Clyde Enright I 've known him for forty years . He was perhaps the gayest member of the international homosexual set , to which an Oxford wit has applied the generic appellation : the Homintern . I 'm an outsider myself but I have always had an entente cordiale with some of its most distinguished members . They like me ! I remembered this morning in church while the organ was playing . I was with Clyde in Florence . We went to the Uffizi . You know that great macabre sculpture stretched out on the floor called The Hermaphrodite ? Clyde looked down at it , turned to me and said enviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of money ! " ( GILIAN 'S tinkling laugh ; SEYMOUR smiles ) But have you noticed  --  well , I suppose you children are too young to notice p. 132 GILIAN PROSPER Thank you , Brock dear . It 's the only nice thing you 've ever said to me ! BROCK DUNNAWAY Compared to me you are children . No one who is not , as I am , over seventy knows what it is to be over seventy . This morning , coming back from the church , I felt an extraordinary excitement , an extraordinary joy in living . I relished each instant and the miracles it contained : the sights from the cab  --  the fact that I was able to see the back of the cabbie 's neck  --  it all became cherishable . The vastness , the intricacy , the cunning contradictions of sheer consciousness  --  at my disposal , denied to Clyde . That it was withheld forever from Clyde intensified my sense of well-being . Rather awful , is n't it ? GILIAN PROSPER Naturally ! BROCK DUNNAWAY ( Tolerantly ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one who insults you ! GILIAN PROSPER Do your worst tonight . I am so armored in happiness that nothing you can say will affect me in the least . BROCK DUNNAWAY If you are happy , dear one , some victim must be in pain . GILIAN PROSPER ( To SEYMOUR ) Are you in pain , Seymour ? BROCK DUNNAWAY ( Very quick  --  to SEYMOUR ) Before you entangle yourself with Gilian , Seymour , you 'd better talk to me . ( CHARLIE comes back ) p. 133 CHARLES TANEY Oh , Brock ! Hello ! ( BROCK salutes him , military-style ) GILIAN PROSPER ( To CHARLIE ) Is Doctor Greer coming ? CHARLES TANEY He 's going to try . BROCK DUNNAWAY ( To CHARLIE ) You 're his patient are n't you , Charlie ? Does he help you ? CHARLES TANEY I help him ! GILIAN PROSPER By getting him patients like Seymour . ( To SEYMOUR ) Do n't go , Seymour . I 'll do more for you than he can . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( To GILIAN ) Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too closely , at that ! I hate being over-explained . I do n't want to know why I do anything . I just enjoy doing it . BROCK DUNNAWAY For once I agree with you , Gilian . Has anyone tried to analyze Iago ? I think he would have resisted it ! GILIAN PROSPER ( Pleased ) What makes you think of Iago in connection with me ? BROCK DUNNAWAY Free association . They 're always rooting , these psychiatrists , for antecedent causes for evil conduct . I do n't think there was any antecedent cause for Iago . He was just naturally mean . This search for motives behind bad actions seems to me silly . It is based on the assumption that people are naturally good . It is an untested assumption . The history of the inhuman race contradicts it . Maybe people are just naturally bad . It is virtue that should be explained . That 's where the hidden motive should be sought . ( HARRY comes in , excited and beaming ) p. 134 HARRY LORCH The violist is here ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes  --  for Faith and Willard ? HARRY LORCH Oh , they 're up there . They went straight up to your place in the elevator . ( GILIAN gets up , BROCK remains seated ) GILIAN PROSPER Come on , Brock . You 'll absorb culture . BROCK DUNNAWAY ( Pitifully ) Do I have to go up ? Ca n't I listen from here ? I love this room  --  this chair  --  this bar . HARRY LORCH ( Shocked ) But , Mr. Dunnaway ! Do n't you love chamber music ? BROCK DUNNAWAY Not in the least . HARRY LORCH ( Hurt , appalled , he appeals to all of them solemnly ) But in chamber music the composers expressed all their most intimate thoughts . BROCK DUNNAWAY But you forget , dear Harry , I have intimate thoughts of my own and they bore the hell out of me . Now why should I be interested in the intimate thoughts of dead composers ? HARRY LORCH ( Shaking his head ) He should n't say things like that  --  even as a joke ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 135 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Joins him , starts to walk him out ) There 's a bar in my place too , you know , Brock . ( He walks BROCK out of the room ) BROCK DUNNAWAY ( Goes but protesting ) It would have been so pleasant just to sit here and talk . I knew this house when I first came to New York . It was occupied by a shipping tycoon and his lovely wife . She was my first love . She was so lovely  --  and so indiscreet ( BROCK and SEYMOUR go out , GILIAN and CHARLIE following . As the latter reach the door , CHARLIE stops a minute ) CHARLES TANEY Well , Gilian ? GILIAN PROSPER Well ? CHARLES TANEY Still going to Stockholm ? GILIAN PROSPER ( Winds her arm through his affectionately ) Did n't I tell you , darling , not to underestimate me ? ( As they go out the lights dim ) p. 136 Act 3 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO Scene : The same . A half-hour later . Through the open door and during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exquisite melody of the slow movement of the Schubert A-Minor Quartet . At rise : GILIAN walks in , followed by WILLARD . WILLARD wears the same shabby suit he wore in Act One . GILIAN PROSPER ( As she walks in and goes to her accustomed chair ) Leave the door open , will you , darling ? ( As she sits and the music comes through ) Is n't it exquisite ? To listen from here without having to look at the faces of the players ? Those faces are not quite ethereal , are they ? Those jowls pressed on the shells of the instruments . I feel every moment they 'll break . So distracting ! I 'm on champagne tonight . Get me some , there 's a dear boy . ( WILLARD goes to the bar , pours some champagne , brings it to her . She looks up at him ) How do you feel ? WILLARD PROSPER Light as air . Free as air . Liberated , marvelous . GILIAN PROSPER Liberated from what ? WILLARD PROSPER From myself . GILIAN PROSPER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . Why should you want to be ? Whatever you are  --  you are . You 're stuck with it ! p. 137 WILLARD PROSPER ( Smiles ) Perhaps , I meant , liberated from you . GILIAN PROSPER I do n't believe that either . The moment I caught your eye  --  up there  --  you knew that I wanted to get out of there , did n't you ? And you got up to go before I did . Your father and I were like that . We knew , without speaking , what the other was thinking . ( WILLARD kneels beside her , caresses her face ) Your father used to make that gesture . He worshiped me , you know . When he was sober . WILLARD PROSPER I am not sober . And I worship you . GILIAN PROSPER Sweet ! You 're sweet tonight . WILLARD PROSPER I no longer hope for anything from you . I no longer want anything from you GILIAN PROSPER When did that happen ? WILLARD PROSPER Just now . Upstairs . Listening to the music . GILIAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know . We worry everybody . And , as the President says in his press conferences , " I have an announcement to make . " WILLARD PROSPER What ? GILIAN PROSPER I intend to marry Seymour . p. 138 WILLARD PROSPER My blessing ! GILIAN PROSPER Is that all ? WILLARD PROSPER I am too poor to give you anything else . GILIAN PROSPER I 'll be influential , wo n't I ? I 'll see that Seymour gives you that grant . WILLARD PROSPER I do n't want the grant . GILIAN PROSPER That 's perverse . Why not ? WILLARD PROSPER I am going to follow the example of a friend of mine  --  and become a Trappist monk . ( She laughs ) I 'm sick of the sound of my own voice . It 'll be heaven  --  no longer to have to listen to it . GILIAN PROSPER I love your voice . It 's a charming voice . It 's your father 's voice . WILLARD PROSPER I love your face . And yet  --  when I look at it  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you blame me for that . So unjust . But then , Willard  --  we have to face it  --  you 're psychotic , are n't you , as your father was ? ( A pause . The music comes through clearly . Finally ) Was the world really as harmonious and as tranquil as that , do you think , when Schubert wrote it ? Or was it a lie ? Were they all jangled up just as we are only they did n't have the courage to admit it ? What do you think ? Art was like a formal garden , was n't it , in those days ? p. 139 WILLARD PROSPER Those six weeks when I was in prison GILIAN PROSPER Yes ? WILLARD PROSPER I wrote a quite lovely lyric . I did it to get away from my thoughts . GILIAN PROSPER What were your thoughts ? WILLARD PROSPER Hatred of my father . And not on account of my dead brother . No . That 's not accurate . It was n't hatred . It was jealousy . I remembered how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his success , of his greatness . Because it was that success and that greatness that gave him you . GILIAN PROSPER ( She is caressing his hair  --  she is titillated by this ) Poor boy ! Were you jealous ? Were you ? WILLARD PROSPER And yet my lyric reflected none of that . Nothing of what I was feeling . It was about birds in flight . GILIAN PROSPER The formal garden ! WILLARD PROSPER Yes . GILIAN PROSPER I have been  --  all this time  --  on the verge with you . WILLARD PROSPER I no longer care . GILIAN PROSPER ( Her hand still caressing his hair ) That 's not gallant . p. 140 WILLARD PROSPER Shall I lie to you ? GILIAN PROSPER I am tempted to give in . My last fling . Before I settle down with Seymour . ( He kneels by her side , holding her hand . He kisses her hands ) Your father always felt a sense of guilt . Will you feel a sense of guilt ? WILLARD PROSPER Be careful , darling . GILIAN PROSPER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or  --  if I am  --  I enjoy it . Life is monotonous . I enjoy the whiff of danger . WILLARD PROSPER I have often wished to kill you . GILIAN PROSPER I know . WILLARD PROSPER At the same time GILIAN PROSPER I know that too . WILLARD PROSPER I have thought it through . It 's not you I want to kill . It 's myself I want to kill . GILIAN PROSPER Why are n't you more direct  --  like your father ? ( WILLARD laughs . She laughs too . He lies flat on the floor , beside her chair , his hands behind his neck ) WILLARD PROSPER You 're so logical . It 's beautiful  --  like a formula in mathematics . p. 141 GILIAN PROSPER ( Caressingly ) You are so very gifted . Why have n't you done more ? You have your father 's gift . Why have n't you imitated him ? WILLARD PROSPER But my father was n't inhibited and I am . GILIAN PROSPER Do n't be inhibited . There 's no percentage in it . WILLARD PROSPER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilian GILIAN PROSPER Of what ? WILLARD PROSPER Of getting involved with me . GILIAN PROSPER But I am involved with you . WILLARD PROSPER I worship you . Ever since you kissed me that day  --  I 've worshiped you . Was it kindness made you do it ? GILIAN PROSPER I do n't think so . WILLARD PROSPER What was it then ? GILIAN PROSPER I wanted to . WILLARD PROSPER But you have n't really wanted to since ? ( GILIAN says nothing . He insists ) Have you ? GILIAN PROSPER You 'll find out  --  one of these days . WILLARD PROSPER I 'll never find out because I am never going to see you again . p. 142 GILIAN PROSPER Really ? WILLARD PROSPER Really . I am going away . GILIAN PROSPER Where ? WILLARD PROSPER ( Smiles charmingly up at her ) None of your God-damn business . GILIAN PROSPER In that case  --  you may find out before . You may find out now . WILLARD PROSPER I warn you , Gilian . You know , we psychotics are very cunning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you think I 'll be afraid of you ? WILLARD PROSPER ( Humorously ) Remember I warned you ! ( BROCK comes in . Sees WILLARD lying on the floor ) BROCK DUNNAWAY Ah ! The Beatnik Recumbent ! But I interrupt . GILIAN PROSPER Not at all . In fact  --  your entrance is timely . ( She gets up , walks toward him . WILLARD gets up too . BROCK sits in GILIAN 's chair ) BROCK DUNNAWAY ( To WILLARD ) I hear you 've been tapped for Skull and Bones , Willard . You 're put out to pasture with me on Seymour 's money . Did I tell you by the way that I enjoyed your book  --  what there is of it  --  enormously ? I do hope you 'll have sense enough not to finish it . It ca n't possibly sell  --  it 's too subtle and too well written . Do as I am doing  --  keep getting extensions from the Foundation . ( He sits ) God , that music bored me . And the devotional expression of the listeners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they 're doing something elevated . We 're living in a wonderful time , Willard . When I was young there were no Guggenheims , no Fulbrights , no Rosenthals . We became expert in the technique of eating without food . p. 143 GILIAN PROSPER ( Cuts through this ) Brock  --  BROCK DUNNAWAY Yes , asp . GILIAN PROSPER You can do me a favor as recompense for all the compliments you 've paid me over the years . BROCK DUNNAWAY If I can do it without getting up , I 'll do it . GILIAN PROSPER If anyone comes in  --  if anyone asks for us  --  say that Willard and I have gone for a ride in the Park in a hansom , will you ? ( WILLARD is watching her narrowly ) BROCK DUNNAWAY I will . GILIAN PROSPER Do you promise ? BROCK DUNNAWAY I promise . I love little chores like that . ( Without a word GILIAN turns and walks into the bedroom . A moment . WILLARD and BROCK exchange a look . WILLARD 'S expression has changed  --  it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At my age I can no longer act . I can only observe . ( Swiftly WILLARD follows GILIAN into the bedroom , shutting the door after him . There is the sound of the key turning in the lock . BROCK sits for a moment looking at the locked door . He grins , happy as a Cheshire cat : the episode gives him enormous pleasure . The hall door is open ; the music comes in strongly now that there is silence in the room . BROCK gets up , goes to the bar , mixes himself a highball . As he returns with the drink to his chair , almost audibly purring , FAITH comes in . She wears a charming , simple evening frock . She is disturbed ) p. 144 BROCK DUNNAWAY Oh , Faith , come in . Do Schubert 's most intimate thoughts bore you too ? FAITH PROSPER No . I love it . It 's beautiful . BROCK DUNNAWAY Why , then , do you absent yourself from felicity ? FAITH PROSPER Where 's Willard ? Have you seen him ? BROCK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FAITH PROSPER I saw him walk out with Gilian . BROCK DUNNAWAY They were both here . Just a minute ago . FAITH PROSPER Where are they ? BROCK DUNNAWAY Gilian had an impulse to take a turn in the Park in a hansom . She felt stuffy in here . FAITH PROSPER Did they say when they 'd be back ? BROCK DUNNAWAY Not a word . FAITH PROSPER Was Willard all right ? BROCK DUNNAWAY Seemed as happy as a Princeton boy whose sweet-heart has just told him he could take her to the Senior Prom . FAITH PROSPER ( She is lingering at the door ) If you see him before I do  --  tell him to come up , will you ? It was rather rude of them , I think , to walk out like that . p. 145 BROCK DUNNAWAY They were listening from here . They got tired of listening from here . Stay and talk to me , Faith . FAITH PROSPER I want to get back to the music . BROCK DUNNAWAY Why ? FAITH PROSPER Because I love it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laughs ) You 're hopeless , Brock ! BROCK DUNNAWAY Of course I am . What else can you be at my age ? The most you can achieve is a kind of damp independence . But I have had an interesting past . Do n't you want to hear some delicious anecdotes from my throbbing past ? FAITH PROSPER I 'd love to but not now . Harry 'll be hurt if he sees I 'm not there . ( FAITH goes out . BROCK , full of contentment , sits , sipping his highball . His eye wanders to the bedroom door ) BROCK DUNNAWAY ( Aloud to himself  --  his voice sharp with irony ) Ah ! Youth ! Youth ! ( The lights dim down , not to a complete blackout but simply to indicate passage of time . When they go up again BROCK is at the bar , refilling his highball glass . CHARLIE comes in ) p. 146 BROCK DUNNAWAY Hello , Maestro ! Delighted to see you ! ( He walks back to his chair with his drink ) Arnold Bennett once said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  CHARLES TANEY Those God-damn musicians are inexhaustible . Every time I think , " Ah ! They 've reached the end , " they start in all over again . BROCK DUNNAWAY ( Inexorable , once he starts a story he must finish it ) He was a dear man , Bennett , and as I say , he was fascinated by hotels . His real ambition , he once told me , was to run a really first-class hotel . Because , he said , if you run a really first-class hotel , you do n't have to seek out anybody . Everybody who is anybody will eventually come to you . That is the way it is with me in this room . I sit here . Everybody comes to me . ( CHARLIE starts toward the bedroom door ) Charlie CHARLES TANEY ( Stops ) What ? BROCK DUNNAWAY Faith was just in here . She said it was rude of me to leave when the musicians are giving their all . Perhaps it is . Let 's go back . CHARLES TANEY Have you seen Gilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 147 CHARLES TANEY With Willard ? BROCK DUNNAWAY With Willard . CHARLES TANEY Where are they then ? BROCK DUNNAWAY They went for a ride in the Park in a hansom . Juvenile , is n't it ? CHARLES TANEY ( Incredulous ) In a hansom ! BROCK DUNNAWAY Yes . You 've seen them . For nostalgics . CHARLES TANEY In the Park ! BROCK DUNNAWAY Yes . You 've seen it . The Eden of juvenile delinquents . They carve you up so nicely there . ( CHARLIE comes close to BROCK  --  looks at him ) CHARLES TANEY Something tells me that you are a God-damn liar ! ( At this moment there is the sound through the bedroom door of a scuffle , a sharp cry , a heavy blow and the thud of a falling body . BROCK holds onto CHARLIE 'S arm in a tight grip so he ca n't move ) BROCK DUNNAWAY ( In a kind of ecstasy ) May the best man win ! ( CHARLIE tries to tear his arm loose , but BROCK is strong and tenacious ) p. 148 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to shake his arm free ) BROCK DUNNAWAY Why expose yourself , unnecessarily , on the line of fire ? ( But CHARLIE succeeds . He starts toward the door in a fury ) BROCK DUNNAWAY In any case , the door is locked . ( CHARLIE reaches the door , tries it and then starts banging on it . Inside there is silence now ) CHARLES TANEY Gilian  --  open the door  --  it 's my room ! Open the door ! ( He keeps banging maniacally at the door  --  it suddenly opens ) GILIAN PROSPER ( Over her shoulder  --  into the room ) Lie there , scum ! ( CHARLIE rushes past her into the room ) GILIAN PROSPER ( To BROCK ) Brock  --  a brandy please . ( BROCK jumps to obey . GILIAN  --  feeling her throat  --  leans back against the bedroom door . She is terribly shaken but also triumphant . BROCK comes to her with a brandy glass . GILIAN takes it ) Thank you . I 've telephoned the police . Is n't it funny ? I 'm always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him ) Cheers ! ( She gulps the brandy  --  BROCK , stares at her . A moment . GILIAN pulls herself together  --  starts for the stairs , her hand still on her neck ) p. 149 GILIAN PROSPER ( As she passes BROCK ) Brock  --  am I presentable ? BROCK DUNNAWAY Passably . GILIAN PROSPER ( As she starts up the stairs ) I need a tranquilizer . Franz Schubert beckons me ! ( As BROCK looks after her  --  titillated and admiring  --  the lights black out ) p. 150 Act 3 , Scene 3 SCENE THREE Scene : The same . Late afternoon , a few days later . At rise : SEYMOUR is at the desk . He has a sheet of paper before him on which a poem is written . It affects him . He puts the poem down . He leans over the table , his hands over his eyes . CHARLIE comes in . CHARLES TANEY What 's the matter ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Comes to ) Oh , nothing I was just reading those poems again that young Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've asked her to come in . Know anything about her ? CHARLES TANEY It 's hard to get anything out of her . Very withdrawn  --  poverty-stricken  --  scared . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Charlie CHARLES TANEY ( Looks at him ) You look done in . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Do I ? CHARLES TANEY What 's wrong ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I 'm worried , Charlie . ( He gets up , starts to pace the room ) p. 151 CHARLES TANEY ( Trying to sound unconcerned ) Maybe that trip to Stockholm with Gilian  --  will rest you . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( After a moment ) I am terribly troubled , Charlie . About many things  --  CHARLES TANEY ( Wary ) For instance ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL This difference between us  --  over Willard CHARLES TANEY Surely that is settled now ! SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL How do you mean  --  settled ? CHARLES TANEY Surely there could be no question of giving him a grant now ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Now , I should think , more than ever . CHARLES TANEY ( In protest ) You ca n't be serious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he belongs . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( He passes his hand over his eyes in weariness ) It seems very strange to me CHARLES TANEY ( His temper beginning to rise ) What ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Gilian is perfectly well . She hit Willard with a paperweight so hard that he has a concussion of the brain . And yet Willard is in custody . p. 152 CHARLES TANEY ( Very angry ) Now really , Seymour ! You do n't make sense . Willard was going to strangle her . If Gilian had n't been  --  resourceful  --  she 'd be dead now and Willard would be up for murder . Would you still want to give him the grant ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( In pain , but with an indomitable clarity and conviction ; he is very quiet ) Do you know what happened in that room  --  what really happened ? CHARLES TANEY Of course I do . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL You know what Gilian told you . You have only heard one side of it . CHARLES TANEY My God , Seymour , what is this God-damn obsession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with him ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Very quiet , very firm ) Do n't lose your temper , Charlie . Sit down . ( CHARLIE glares at him ; his nerves are frayed ) Please , Charlie . Sit down . ( CHARLIE sits ) CHARLES TANEY Well ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL The other day  --  when we were discussing this  --  you brought it up against Willard that he did n't like you . That he had made contemptuous remarks about me , about the Foundation . p. 153 CHARLES TANEY So he did . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL You were prepared to turn him down then  --  on personal grounds ? CHARLES TANEY I was prepared to turn him down because I knew he was a hysteric and a drunk and irresponsible . And now he has so conveniently justified all my fears . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL You told Faith I had turned Willard down  --  when I had n't . You reproached Faith for sending the book to me . Going over your head , you called it . Is n't that a petty consideration  --  a petty vanity  --  when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps  --  certainly a talent CHARLES TANEY We decided at the beginning that authority was to rest in me SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I believed you would exercise it  --  justly . CHARLES TANEY You are sentimental  --  just as you were with Brock SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL There is an inch of conflict here  --  an inch . I suppose , in the welter in which we live , trivial and unimportant . Still , this tiny issue CHARLES TANEY ( Truculent ) Well ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL This inch over which you had control involves a question of responsibility . I hate to say it , Charlie  --  I have to steel myself to say it  --  but , in my view , you have proved yourself irresponsible . p. 154 CHARLES TANEY Did I hear you correctly ? Did you say  --  " had " control ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Yes . CHARLES TANEY What does that mean exactly ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I have come to a decision , Charlie . CHARLES TANEY Well ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I have decided to run the Foundation myself . I want to devote all my time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him without moving ) CHARLES TANEY ( Finally ) You 're firing me . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Very quiet ) I want you to resign . As I say , Charlie  --  you are too personal . I want this Foundation to be run  --  impersonally . I want it to consider , in its applicants , only two things : merit and need . CHARLES TANEY Including criminals ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Dryly ) Dear Charlie . You ca n't impose a strict moral code on artists . But I think you must on executives . If an executive  --  at least in an enterprise like this  --  has n't got that  --  what has he got ? CHARLES TANEY I 'll be God damned ! p. 155 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL You must know , dear Charlie , that this is n't easy for me . CHARLES TANEY You 're not saying these things to me . I 'm dreaming . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I do n't have to say  --  do I ?  --  that on the financial side  --  CHARLES TANEY ( Bitter  --  walks toward SEYMOUR with drin ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult . You are making it more difficult . But I will say what I have to say . On the financial side I will be generous . You 'll have no worry on that score . And also  --  before you call my attention to it  --  I will tell you that I have n't forgotten the past . I remember everything , how you befriended me at Yale , how generous you were , how you stood by me when I was alone and swamped in a sense of inadequacy . I know all that . I remember all that . But , also , I have allowed my sense of gratitude to obscure my vision of you . I am slow . I am very slow . CHARLES TANEY ( Thinking fast , quietly ) All right . Give Willard the grant . It 's O.K. with me . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL But Charlie ! It is not O.K. with you . Why do you say it is ? CHARLES TANEY ( With mounting anger ) Because while you have always been so generous and gallant as to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it has obviously been all along a fiction . I do n't know why you choose this moment to assert the reality . Well , let 's face the reality . Let 's proceed henceforth on the basis of reality . I 'll make the recommendations  --  you accept or veto them . When you make them  --  that will be that . We 're grown men . We 're old friends . Does it have to dissolve , this friendship , on a difference of opinion in one bizarre instance ? p. 156 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Yes . It does . CHARLES TANEY In the name of good sense  --  will you tell me why ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Your willingness now  --  to yield on this issue  --  merely illustrates what I mean . I do n't want obedience . I want conviction . It 's awfully difficult for me to say these things  --  without sounding  --  holier-than-thou CHARLES TANEY ( Decides to re-animate his well-known charm ) When you 're holier-than-thou with me , you 're giving yourself a wide margin ! SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Smiles ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . You are so very amusing . You are so frank about yourself . CHARLES TANEY ( Keeping it up ) That 's my pose  --  frankness . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL That is amusing too . But I do n't want the Foundation run by a man with whom frankness is a pose . The time is too  --  exacting CHARLES TANEY Oh , I 'm tired of hearing that . This time 's no different from any other time . There were always wars and troubles . What difference does it make to the corpse if he 's killed by a bow and arrow  --  a howitzer  --  or an atomic bomb ? There were always those who went under  --  and those who survived . You 're blowing up this thing out of all proportion . p. 157 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL It is particularly necessary  --  in a time like this  --  to be scrupulous . CHARLES TANEY Are you suggesting that I am unscrupulous ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL It 's a matter of simple justice . CHARLES TANEY Who the hell is just ? Who can be ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know when you 're not . ( A pause . Somehow , now CHARLIE realizes the jig is up . He gets up in a terrible fury ; loses all control of himself ) CHARLES TANEY ( Faces SEYMOUR with outright hostility ) You 're pretty clever ! You 're pretty cunning . You do pretty well for yourself , do n't you ? Are you showing off in front of Gilian ? Is that it ? Now that you 're going to marry Gilian you want to show her you do n't depend on me ? It 's about the only way you can show Gilian that you are strong , virile ! By firing your oldest friend . Well , all I can say is , that I hope this display will satisfy her , on the boat to Stockholm ! SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Stutters a bit ) You see , Charlie . You 're  --  personal ! CHARLES TANEY What the hell do you expect me to be ? You snitched Gilian away from me . And not as a man may take a woman away from another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash ! When I think of those early years , when you used to come whimpering to me like a spaniel ( GILIAN walks in ) p. 158 GILIAN PROSPER Hello , boys ! ( Neither of them says anything ) What 's the matter ? Lovers ' quarrel ? Over me , I hope ! CHARLES TANEY ( With hatred , to SEYMOUR ) I ca n't bear the sight of either of you ! ( He starts for the door to his room ) I hope I may still have the use of this apartment  --  for a few days at least ! ( He goes blindly into his room and slams the door ) GILIAN PROSPER ( Astonished ) What on earth 's gotten into Charlie ? Is it about me ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Shaken but quiet ) Partly . GILIAN PROSPER Do n't give it a thought , darling . I 'll scold him about it . He 'll be as sweet as honey , I promise you . He 'll come to see us off . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I 'm not going . GILIAN PROSPER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point in telling you the reasons . GILIAN PROSPER But this is n't like you . You told me you were going . You do n't lie ! It is one of your eccentricities which I find so appealing . p. 159 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL You said something the other day it 's odd , Gilian while you were saying it I was n't really listening but then afterward I heard you saying it GILIAN PROSPER ( Sympathetically ) You after-heard it ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Yes . GILIAN PROSPER That often happens to me . What did I say ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL You spoke of my " good works "  --  so you called them  --  and said you did n't believe in them , but that you would permit me to indulge them GILIAN PROSPER ( Kindly ) Oh , but , darling , surely you have n't changed your mind on account of those idle words . Where 's your sense of humor ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I am not sure I have a sense of humor . GILIAN PROSPER You must have a sense of humor or I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grain . He told clumsy jokes at which he laughed appreciatively , but he had no humor . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL It is n't what you said  --  the words you said  --  it was the tone . The tone of all of you . You are all so amusing ! It is really too cynical  --  too unfeeling  --  I do n't really belong , you know . p. 160 GILIAN PROSPER You do n't have to belong . I am sophisticated enough for both of us . Now tell me really why you 're not going to Stockholm . Why did you say you 'd go ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Because I thought it would break it up  --  between you and Willard . GILIAN PROSPER ( A moment ) As an assist to Faith ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL You might put it that way . GILIAN PROSPER Are you in love with Faith ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Yes . GILIAN PROSPER What stops you ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL For one thing  --  she does n't know it . GILIAN PROSPER Why do n't you inform her ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Turns away ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PROSPER The amusing thing is  --  it would have worked . I was n't going to see Willard any more . But there he was  --  that night . Are you sure  --  that Stockholm is off ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Stockholm is off . GILIAN PROSPER ( Smiles ) Shall I work on you ? p. 161 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Please do n't . Nothing could induce me to go . GILIAN PROSPER ( Musing aloud , struck by the incredible wonder of it ) Imagine ! My losing a man to that little Faith Prosper ! ( FAITH comes in . She freezes at the sight of GILIAN ) SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL How 's Willard ? FAITH PROSPER He 's going to be all right , thank God . GILIAN PROSPER I have instructed my lawyer  --  not to prefer charges against Willard . Seymour do you mind if I go in to see Charlie for a minute ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Not at all . GILIAN PROSPER ( As she moves toward the door , then stops when she gets there ; to FAITH ) When you see Willard again  --  give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not vindictive , you see . ( She goes out ) SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I am glad to hear  --  that Willard is out of the woods . FAITH PROSPER When I left the hospital just now I walked into a church and knelt and prayed and thanked God . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I wish you 'd bring me to see him . p. 162 FAITH PROSPER It would be wonderful if you would . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL If he 's in the mood to discuss it  --  I 'd like to talk to Willard  --  about his book FAITH PROSPER ( A bit incredulous ) You mean  --  nothing is changed about that ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Why should it be ? ( FAITH turns away , overcome ) FAITH PROSPER I am always breaking down with you ! Damn it ! I love you , Seymour . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Thinks perhaps this is the moment to inform her ) I love you , Faith . FAITH PROSPER And I came here to tell you ( She turns , in control of herself , comes to him ) SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Yes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dearest friend I have in the world . And therefore I want to tell you I am going to marry Harry . I want your blessing . We want your blessing . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL You have my blessing . FAITH PROSPER He is a dear man . When you get to know him  --  you 'll see  --  what a dear man he is . Willard is very happy about it . He was afraid , you know , that I was going to marry Charlie . I see now that there was never any real danger  --  thanks to Charlie  --  but Willard did n't know that . And for a long time  --  neither did I. p. 163 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I think you have chosen wisely . I do . FAITH PROSPER We 'll have good times . We 'll have music parties . And you 'll come . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Smiles at her ) I will certainly come . FAITH PROSPER I am so lucky . To have Willard . To have Harry . To have you . ( Impulsively she flings her arms around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( As FAITH breaks away ) Ah , Seymour . I see you took my suggestion . You did inform her . ( To FAITH ) Congratulations , Faith ! FAITH PROSPER ( Breathless ) Thank you . But how did you know ? ( To SEYMOUR  --  under her breath ) I 'll arrange it and call you . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Do . ( FAITH runs out ) GILIAN PROSPER ( Looks after FAITH , in admiration of an exercise in technique ) Well , very clever that little girl ! I always thought her stupid , to tell you the truth . Did n't know she had it in her . Did n't know you had it in you . Well , at least one of Craig 's children has turned out well ! p. 164 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Soberly ) Yes . She has turned out very well . GILIAN PROSPER Is n't it conceited of you to say so ? It 's the first time I 've ever known you to make an arrogant remark . Good sign ! ( Looks at him sharply ) But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter ? Have you got cold feet ? ( CHARLIE comes in . As he does the telephone rings . He answers it ) CHARLES TANEY Oh , Alvin , how are you I was just going to call you I have to cancel our date Sailing for Stockholm Wednesday just decided not quite alone Gilian 's sailing too . Is n't it a lucky coincidence ? Expect you to see us off Expect Seymour to see us off too and maybe you can nab him at the pier Okey-doke . ( He hangs up  --  faces SEYMOUR ) SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I 'm very pleased for you , Charlie . GILIAN PROSPER Never in my life have I been so ignominiously dismissed ! Maybe it 's the tolling of the bell for me ? Is it the beginning of the end ? My first defeat . Maybe I should retire from the battle ? CHARLES TANEY ( In high humor , completely restored ) You do n't know what battle is yet , Gilian . All those minor skirmishes of ours  --  nothing ! From now on you 'll find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To SEYMOUR ) I ca n't wait to pick up that ticket  --  before our girl changes her mind ! I do n't mind in the least , Seymour , understudying you . You know what sometimes happens in the theatre  --  the understudy gives a better performance than the star ! ( CHARLIE and GILIAN start out . CHARLIE disappears , GILIAN lingers for a moment at the door ) p. 165 GILIAN PROSPER Oh , Seymour  --  I almost forgot to tell you . I have a message for you from Anna , my cook . She wants to come to work for you . She loves you . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I 'd love to have her . Who would n't ? She 's a genius . GILIAN PROSPER I 'll tell her . She 'll be in seventh heaven . She believes you 'll be good for her insomnia . You 'll come to see us off , wo n't you ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Of course I will . GILIAN PROSPER To show you how big I am I 'll let you bring the bride . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Just as she is going , BROCK comes in ) BROCK DUNNAWAY Ah ! Lucretia ! Greetings ! ( As he moves past her into the room ) I always thought The Rape of Lucrece the most boring of Shakespeare 's works . I never read it without a strong feeling that Lucrece cooperated  --  do n't you agree ? GILIAN PROSPER You are a lecherous old man ! BROCK DUNNAWAY Of course I am . Why should the young have it all ? GILIAN PROSPER I wish I had known you in your youth . p. 166 BROCK DUNNAWAY You 'd not have been disappointed . GILIAN PROSPER ( Pointedly ) I wonder ! ( She goes ) BROCK DUNNAWAY ( To SEYMOUR ) There is an incredibly beautiful dark young lady waiting for you in the hall , Seymour . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Oh , that 's Sheila Maloney . I 'll just see her for a minute and then I 'm at your service . BROCK DUNNAWAY I thought Charlie broke them in . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL No longer . BROCK DUNNAWAY Oh ? SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find Willard ? BROCK DUNNAWAY Remarkably cheerful . I congratulated him . I told him he was probably unique in the history of jurisprudence  --  the first man who managed to get arrested in a rape case on a triple divorce . SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( Smiles ) But he 's all right is he ? You think he 'll be all right ? BROCK DUNNAWAY Oh yes . Moreover , I got the feeling  --  I strongly got the feeling  --  p. 167 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Yes ? BROCK DUNNAWAY That he 's finally paid off the inheritance tax . That the vendetta is liquidated at last  --  SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Did Willard tell you what really happened ? BROCK DUNNAWAY He did . After embracing Gilian  --  is n't that an old  --  fashioned word ? Does n't that date me ? ( Enjoys being slow ) After embracing Gilian , Willard did try to kill her . But , having failed , having , in fact , been nearly killed by her , I believe that the compulsion to revenge is satisfied . I do believe that the ghost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in horror ) Oh , dear ! That might be mistaken for a pun  --  and I abhor puns ! SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL Well  --  let 's hope  --  ( A moment ) Will you ask Miss Maloney to come in . I just want to tell her I like her stuff . Then we 'll go to dinner . BROCK DUNNAWAY Right . If I were in your position I 'd ask Miss Maloney to dinner . ( BROCK goes . SEYMOUR , brooding and restless , walks up to the French windows , pulls the curtains aside and looks out . He comes back as SHEILA MALONEY , a lovely dark young Irish girl , comes in . MISS MALONEY is in an agony of nervous shyness ; her hands tremble . SEYMOUR comes to greet her ) p. 168 SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I 'm Seymour Rosenthal . I am very glad to see you . SHEILA MALONEY Thank you . ( SEYMOUR goes behind desk , motions her to a chair beside him . SHEILA sits ) SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL ( The sheaf of poems is before him  --  he picks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  as a kind of refresher . SHEILA MALONEY It 's very kind of you to take the trouble . ( He smiles and so does she , faintly ) SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL I have never , I think , felt so strongly , that an applicant should have a grant from this Foundation SHEILA MALONEY ( Overcome , stammers ) I  --  I do n't know what to say SEYMOUR ROSENTHAL You do n't have to say anything . Miss Maloney . You have said everything  --  and beautifully  --  ( He taps the manuscript ) here ( As he leans toward her to discuss the details of the grant )
