He emphasized that he had no intention of resigning his city post " at this time . " But Martin Meyerson , president of the State University at Buffalo , said he hoped Dr. Costello would join its faculty some time this year . Dr. Costello is a former state chairman of the Liberal party and the highest-ranking Liberal in the city government . He ran with Mr. Lindsay , a Republiban , for President of the City Council on the fusion ticket in 1965 , but was defeated by Frank D. O'Connor , who was elected last November to the State Supreme Court . Dr. Costello was questioned as a result of reports circulat-1 ing in the upstate city that he was considering joining the Buffalo faculty this summer , that his name had already appeared on a university catalogue as a faculty meinber and that he had been looking for living quarters in the Buffalo area .

Ho said Dr. Costello 's name had not appeared on the catalogue , but that he had heard that Dr. Costello 's name 11ad appeared on another college publication " and the people // who did it were terribly embarrassed because it was premature . " When Dr. Costello was asked whether he had been looking for living quarters in the Buffalo area , he said he would stand on his statement that he had no intention of resigning at this time . " It has always been my intention to return to the academic community at some time and in some position , " he said . " The political science program at Buffalo offers a very , very attractive and significant opportunity to anyone interested in social policy and urban affairs . " Before I can move on to anything else I have to follow through on a number of important activities for the City of New York I am now working on and I would , of course , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect that he might resign before Mr. Lindsay completed his term at the end of this year led to speculation that Dr. Costello and the Liberals generally were disenchanted with the Lindsay administration or that he believed Mr. Lindsay would not run again . When questioned , Dr. Costello said that his relations with the Mayor were good and that he was " very happy " with the Mayor 's recent statement that he was a dear friend and an excellent public servant . " I feel that I am part of the team and that I am making a contribution to the Mayor 's effort to get the city moving again , " he observed .

Rose said the party had not committed itself " even mentally " to any policy . He noted that the Lindsay term was not completed and said the Liberals wanted to see " more of the administration 's record " before reaching a decision . Mr. Rose said the decision would be made by the party as a whole and not by individual leaders and that it would hold a citywide conference on an endorsement in the spring . By that time , he said , other candidates would have declared . Dr. Costello is on leave from his N.Y.U. post and he has never made any secret of his desire to return to the academic world . He said yesterday that he held " a kind of adjunct ( or part-time ) professorship " at the State University at Buffalo and had been up there several times to meet the students and to lecture .
