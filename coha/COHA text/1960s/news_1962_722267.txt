" Mr. Adams is a liar , " Mr. Dallago said in testimony under oath . Later he denied , point by point , each of the eight paragraphs in an affidavit that Mr. Adams had sworn to on the subject of his relations with Mr. Dallago . Assemblyman Donald IA . Campbell , chairman of the Assembly Committee on Ethics and Guidance , said outside the hearing room that there was " certainly conflict " in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He noted that the committee was empowered to refer such matters to law enforcement officers .

It will not be known until Monday whether the Governor definitely will testify . Main Points Denied Mr. Dallago called Mr. Adams " an absolute liar , " " an unmitigated liar " and " an unqualified liar " during his testimony . He also described parts of Mr. Adams ' testimony as " an unqualified lie " and " an unmitigated lie . " He thus denied cardinal points in the charges against Mr. Carlino , which were based in part on Mr. Adams ' affidavit that Lancer officials had told him the Speaker was pushing " a special-interest bill " that would bring many orders for Lancer shelters . Mr. Adams , a former detective , said this conversation took place in December , 1960 , when he was negotiating with Lancer to lease a plant in Booneville , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Mr , Carlino resigned the directorship six days after the bill was passed . He has denied any conflict of interest and has denounced Mr. Adams ' affidavit as " absolutely false and fraudulent .

Hines , a Brookfield , Mo. , banker , said BfAjamin Tessler , a vice president of Lancer , had mentioned Mr. Carlino 's name in the presence of ?

Carlino told me the bill would be passed . Carlino is handling the bill . " Mr. Tessler , who followed Mr. Dallago to the witness chair in the Senate Chamber , said Mr. Carlino 's name " did not come up " at the Feb. 10 meeting with Mr. Hines and Mr. Adams .

He said that the Speaker was not in Lancers ' " hip pocket , " and that he had never said he was . Mr. Adams testified yesterday that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business dealings , Mr. Dallago , a hoarse-voicQ , deep-chested man , responded outside the nearing room . Speaking without the immunity that witnesses have at official hearings , Mr. Dallago denounced Mr. Adams in bold language and said he would welcome any libel or slander suit Mr. Adams might care to bring . Mr. Dallago told the committee that Lancer Industries had never discussed fall-out shelters or shelter legislation with Mr. Carlino , either as a director of the company or as an attorney .

Craig , a former Republican Governor of Indiana , and Clyde H. Hendricks , a former consultant to the Federal Office of Civil Defense . The board chairman said several times that his company had no need to use Mr. Carlino 's name to impress Mr. Adams in negotiating the subcontract to build shelters . " They sought us out , " ' Mr. Dallago said . " They were bending over backwards to impress us . We did n't have to blow our horn . We did n't have to refer to our directors , and we did not .
