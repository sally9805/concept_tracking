Thought for Food A week before the White House Conference on Food , Nutrition and Health was to open in Washington , nobody at the White House could tell President Nixon just how many people he was likely to be addressing on the morning of December 2 or guarantee to the Secret Service that he would not be booed , cursed and generally maligned by some of his hearers . Professor Jean Mayer , a Harvard nutritionist who had been organizing the conference for the President since mid-June and , in the process , acquiring an education in political and social realities that he 'd never thought he needed , hoped to hold the attendance to some 260o academics , corporation executives , blacks , Indians , feminists , Pacific islanders , students , Mexican-Americans , congressmen and members of organizations varying From the American Legion and the US Chamber of Commerce to the Appalachian Volunteers and Mississippi 's Delta Foundation . At least twice that many people had demanded the right to attend . Among the invited and the uninvited there were some who were determined that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , constructive contribution to the Nixon Administration 's proclaimed purposes to end hunger and malnutrition in the United States " for all time " that Professor Mayer and his Presidential associates envisaged . Walter Washington , the District of Columbia 's black mayor , had arranged to have the luxury hotel that had been preempted for the conference thoroughly but unobtrusively policed . The mayor 's policemen had orders to seize and eject any malcontents who might try to disrupt the plenary sessions or the 2o-plus group sessions at which the serious work of the conference was to be done . The preliminaries proved , if nothing else , that hunger in America and the less spectacular ills of malnutrition had come to constitute a true national cause . It had become both imperative and politically profitable for Mr. Nixon to fulfill his promise that the conference findings " will be the basis for action by this Administration and the beginning of a national commitment to put an end to malnutrition and hunger among the poor , to make better use of our agricultural bounty and nutritional knowledge , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President had little notion of what he was getting into last May when he projected the conference as an affair for " executives from the nation 's leading food processing and food distribution companies and trade unions " who would advise him on how to improve government food programs and inspire " the private food market . . . to improve the nutritional status of all Americans . " That undertaking was part of a hasty effort , in response to belatedly recognized congressional pressures , to come up with a convincing Presidential message on " Hunger in America " and , specifically , to beef up the Administration 's parsimonious allocation of funds in the current ( fiscal zio7o ) budget for food stamps for the hungry poor . Nixon ordered his Budget Bureau to squeeze an extra $270-million for food stamps out of defense estimates , the Senate and House eventually authorized and appropriated $610 million , and the President planned to make his signing of that appropriation a major showing of his commitment to the hunger cause before the conference opened . Since the $6to million is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it establishes an annual level of $1.2 billion for food-stamp assistance and renders the Nixon claim of " a total program of $2.5 billion " for the alleviation of hunger more credible than it previously was . AWhite House figure who did know what the President was getting into was his urban affairs specialist , Daniel Patrick Moynihan . Given the President 's commitment to a hunger conference , Moynihan immediately set about broadening its scope and invited Jean Mayer to accept the temporary title of Special Consultant in charge of organizing it . The first of the results , in the Forms of 26 surprisingly positive and innovative panel reports on every conceivable aspect of the hunger problem , are already in hand and the conference itself will be making news , for better or worse , when this is read . However it comes off , the conference and the preparations for it will have contributed enormously to the instruction of one American , French-born Professor Mayer , in the ways and turmoils of the body politic and also of the curious institution at its apex , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academician when he moved from Cambridge to the White House in June . Long before hunger was a cause for anyoneexcept the few zealots who were really aware of its extent in America , it and the related problems of dietary deficiencies were his causes . He was the first witness called by Senator George McGovern 's select committee on hunger . He had a hand in launching the Citizens Inquiry and the CBS television documentary , " Hunger in America , " that in 1967-68 did much to force the problem to national attention . He was a founder and the first chairman of the aggressive National Council on Hunger and Malnutrition , a private organization dedicated to making the well-fed so uncomfortable about the unfed and ill-fed that they will support or at least tolerate the national expenditure of money and effort that is necessary if all Americans are to be adequately fed . Professor Mayer thought , in short , that he knew the score and expected serious opposition and hindrance only from entrenched conservatives , in Congress and in business , when he took on the conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got it from unexpected quarters . He discovered , first of all , that the Nixon establishment had given no practical thought to the matter of financing the conference . Flow to meet his budget of $950,000 was still a problem for him the week before the conference opened . Travel and livincr expenses had to he provided for at least half the conference participants , including several hundred representatives of " the poor . " Mayer extracted 525o,000 from the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare , wangled $5oo,000 from the Ford , Rockefeller and Kellogg Foundations ( the latter , he takes care to say , no relation to Kellogg Foods ) , and looked to the Office of Economic Opportunity and the Agriculture Department for $200,000 . Legal obstacles to the 0E0 and Agriculture contributions had not been resolved on November 25 , and Mayer 's confidence that the money would he forthcoming was not shared by the officials who would have to disgorge it . Mayer 's own National Council was a source of pain and trouble . Its executive director , Washington attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , had expressed a suspicion in one of its publications that the White House conference would turn out to be " a quasi-academic research and study session . . . not vitally concerned with producing substantial increments of social change " and that " the poor and the consumers " invited to it would be submerged and undone by " professors and businessmen . " Kramer kept and shared with any journalists who asked him for it a discouraging tally of Administration actions on hunger matters this year , a summary of niggardly budgetary positions that on its face brought into question the President 's promise of a genuine " national commitment . " It seemed to Mayer that staff members in the service of Senator McGovern and other congressional hunger-fighters sniped at him and his efforts , planting press reports ( false , Mayer says ) that the DECEMBER 6 , 1969 White House required political clearance for participants in the conference and insisted that the roles of black and other minority militants be kept to a manageable minimum . The counter-effect , Mayer says , was to arouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring a representative cross-section of them into the conference . This kind of fire from theoretically friendly quarters convinced Mayer that too many people in the anti-hunger ranks want to preserve the problem as a partisan issue , and that too many others see in it " a symbolic issue " to be used more to further general social reform than to abolish hunger and malnutrition . The force of these and kindred plaints at the White House is reduced by the acknowledged truth of a story9 involving Senator McGovern . Jean Mayer , who still regards the Senator as a friend of the conference , asked him last July if he would be willing to address it if he were formally invited . McGovern said that he would be happy to . McGovern was told in October that he would not be invited to speak . Mayer later explained : " The fact that Senator McGovern is considered to be a leading candidate for the Presidency on the Democratic side seems to us to be a good reason to get a different Senator . " Another Democrat , Walter Mondale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know that Senator Mondale asked John Kramer of the National Council to draft his conference speech for him .
