Donnybrook ! ( music and lyrics by Johnny Burke ; book by Robert E. McEnroe ) is a mixture of Irish sass and sentiment drawn from the movie The Quiet Man . However good-humored , it has a great deal about it of the mixture as before-even of its own Act I in Act II . A prizefighter from Pittsburgh ( Art Lund ) refuses to put up his fists in clashing with a sneering Innesfree bully over his sister 's hand , wins the girl ( Joan Pagan ) through the cunning of a match maker ( Eddie Foy ) , and at length wins over the brother-in-law in a stage-wide slugfest and floor-roll . <P> All this makes for much rough talk and romantic warbling , with which Donnybrook ! at its best has little to do . Matters perk up when a pub-owning widow ( Su san Johnson ) sings a lament for a spouse she could not lament less ; matters tinkle prettily when the wedding guests toast the bride . Matters are brightest of all by way of Eddie Foy 's flings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees , or his feet seem caught in twisted yarn , or he just sidles off from Ireland and the show , he provides literal footnotes to a great vanishing tradition . But when the show slides back to Ireland and Broadway , all distinction is lost . The doings can be colorfully corny enough , the songs respectably melodious enough , but everything breathes a strictly-for-export Irish air or bogs down in sold-by-the-bottle cheerfulness . Jack Cole 's opening dance has style , but it relentlessly sets the style for all the dancing that follows .
