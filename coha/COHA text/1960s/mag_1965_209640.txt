IN MY TIME by Robert Strausz-Hup. 284 pages . Norton . $5 . <P> <P> Good autobiographers should have happy childhoods , when the nightingales were singing in the orchards of their mothers . Robert Strausz-Hup is such a one . His childhood was a hazy idyl of life in old Vienna , of goose-liver breakfasts on the paternal estate in Hungary . This Eden soon closed its gates , but at 62 he still has a vivid memory of what life was like on the sunny side of the great watershed of World War I. <P> Strausz-Hup is now director of the University of Pennsylvania 's Foreign Policy Research Institute . More scholar than ideologue , he utters no manifestos but offers in comment and anecdote a system of conservative attitudes to shore against the century 's ruins . <P> These attitudes can be disconcerting . For example , he sees the success of the Western parliamentary system as dependent upon the existence of a responsible elite rather like a composite English gentleman-to whom he addresses a prose poem of admiration . He deplores oral contraceptives as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few good and beautiful things that have not yet vanished in the rummage sale of ancient cultures . " He classifies the " passion for ugliness and disfigurement " in modern art as a " danger far greater than depopulation by war . " Liberals would call him a reactionary . Yet his views might more accurately be called the politics of nostalgia . <P> Undarned Suits . His memoir suggests that he came by his views the hard way-by a tough and unsentimental study of himself . Here is his account of himself at 20 : " I moved from one fitful job to another , improvisations without issue ; dreamed my sumptuous dreams of canopied barges on the Nile and throbbing Bentleys in Biarritz ; woke with strangers in dank attics ; nursed the one undarned , too tightly fitting suit-and plotted my escape . Try as I may , I can not bring into focus the young man of 20 . If we were to meet today , we would have little to say to each other . There would be his ruthless naivet , his clammy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own emotions , his stoic indifference toward the feelings of others . " <P> Strausz-Hup came to the U.S. as a tutor-guardian to a no-good Salzburg aristocrat who was older than himself , worked in the art department of Marshall Field 's in Chicago ( landscapes and jolly monks ) , as a runner in Wall Street ( with social weekends on Long Island ) , finally as a customer 's man and-after a return to Europe-as an investment banker . This could have been a simple immigrant 's success story . But Strausz-Hup , however frivolous his youth , had retained the gravitas of a European education . He met Historian Oswald Spengler only once , while dressed as Marc Antony at a Munich carnival , but he had read that master pessimist well .
