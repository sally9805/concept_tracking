The firing of Clark Kerr as president of the University of California was sudden and unexpected . But last week 's reaction from Cal 's faculty and students was entirely predictable : it was visceral and angry . <P> In a rare mood of harmony on the Berkeley campus , students massed near loudspeakers , sent up cheers as they heard their professors denounce the regents ' dismissal of the university president . Assembled as the Academic Senate , 1,000 faculty members approved a resolution terming the action " reckless and precipitate " and amounting to " destructive political intervention " that " threatens the survival of the university as an institution of distinction . " Professors applauded after Berkeley Chancellor Roger Heyns declared that " Clark Kerr was one of the reasons I came to this university , " and insisted that his firing had " the appearance of a political reprisal , " which was " deplorable . " <P> " Senseless Action . " The Berkeley student government fired off letters to 14 regents who had voted to dismiss Kerr , saying that their action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was later denounced at a rally of 7,000 students at U.C.L.A. , which was addressed by Chancellor Franklin D. Murphy , who later said he felt " a sense of deep sadness " over Kerr 's dismissal . Similar protest rallies attracted 6,000 students at Berkeley , 5,000 at the Santa Barbara campus , 3,500 at Riverside . The university 's nine chancellors met in Los Angeles , pledged to continue Kerr 's fight against any university tuition as proposed by Governor Ronald Reagan , and to fight any " erosion of quality and education " caused by budget cuts . <P> Outside California , top officers of the American Association of University Professors , which had honored Kerr in 1964 as a defender of academic freedom , said his dismissal " has profoundly shocked the academic community . " Dr. Samuel Gould , president of New York State 's university system , called Kerr " an outstanding educator " and described the firing as " unfortunate . " <P> At his first major press conference since the firing , Reagan calmly fielded barbed questions , insisted that the action had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the board of re- gents , " he said . " I would not initiate such a procedure and certainly did not feel that , in my first meeting as a regent , this was something that was properly on the agenda . " Added Reagan : " This Governor has no intention of ever overruling the regents . "
