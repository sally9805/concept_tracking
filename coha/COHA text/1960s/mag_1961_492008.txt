women on the living and loving habits of the other that I think it 's time to throw some strong , cold light on the subject . Invariably the key questions asked me are : Who has it better , the American woman or the French ? Who does a better job of being a woman ? Who is happier , and whose men are happier ? American and French women may pose these questions innocently or with narrowed eyes . Either way , simply by posing them they are measuring themselves against each other . First , let us recognize their similarities  --  that they are both women , that they are both interested in their own security and in the security of their children ; that they range in intelligence from the vacuum-packed brain to the knife-sharp intellect . But that , sharp or dull , they both feel this is still a man 's world in which women must step smartly in order to get along . That admitted , we can recognize their first big dissimilarity  --  the way they approach the simple fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the American woman tends to regard being a woman as something to be overcome , something to be compensated for . She strives to stand on an equal footing with the men , to discharge her responsibilities M as competent a manner as a man would , and somehow to overcome the disadvantages of being born to housework and home . In America . womanhood is generally equated with wifehood and motherhood , the togetherness and happiness of the family . In France , being a woman is not just an accident of birth , something you ca n't help ; it is a lifelong career . It is a role , handed to you by the Creator , which must be played to the hilt , with every nuance of expression and emotion possible , with no stage business left undone . If this includes wifehood and motherhood , why , so much the better . Wifehood and motherhood are two normal aspects  --  but only aspects  --  of the great , all-embracing , starring role of Woman which you have been put on earth to play . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she mates it better . She puts foot into it , and a lot of other things , including passion and humor and drama . To do this , she has got to be something of an actress , But she is something of an actress , mostly because she is not afraid to be . Being both more whole and more wholesome , the average American woman is afraid of making a fool of herself . She is honest and forthright , and would rather " just be herself . " The Frenchwoman would n't think of such a thing . For one thing , she ca n't afford it . Where the American woman , confident of her power and independence , can walk up to life squarely and insist on what she considers her due , the Frenchwoman must be as devious as a crab . She must go at life obliquely , taking one step forward and one step to the side , and at the same time pretend she is doing all this for her own delight and amusement and the delight and amusement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt about it . But we who have watched it consider it a pretty artful one . American women can argue all day that the Fromaise lives half her life in make-believe ; the Frenchwoman knows she has to . Moreover , if she 's anything of a woman , she has come to enjoy it . Whether one approves or disapproves , it is impossible to watch the Frenchwoman in all her poses and pursuits without realizing that in France femininity is a perpetually burn ing issue , and that it is the women themselves who arc constantly tossing fuel on the flame  --  not only for the advancement , as we might put it , but also for the sheer play-acting fun of it . Many Americans complain that the Frenchwoman insists on making a production of being female , as if she were the only woman who ever came down the route nationale . And there 's a certain amount of truth to this . Yet , as usual in France , there is a sound reason too . Behind all her make-believe lie certain stony realities which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer rights and protections than the American woman , fewer conveniences and services , and more duties and traditions to observe , today 's Frenchwoman is forced to follow a more circuitous route toward her own fulfillment as an individual . This is the main reason why she depends so heavily on her femininity . It is the only built-in security she has . Unlike her American sister , today 's Froocuise is not an emancipated woman . She is a semiemancipated one living under a civil code that was considered pretty progressive in 1804 . The Code Napoleon has been much amended and reamended and countera mended since it first went into effect on the 30 Ventb se of Year XII of the French Revolution , but it still holds the Frenchwoman in an antiquated antifeminist vise . A misogynist himself , Napoleon had only one interest in women , and that interest had nothing to do with their emancipation . Legislators still share // this comfortable masculine point of view . Although in 1946 , at the end of World War II , the Frenchwoman was finally granted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second-class citizen . Legally and financially the average Frenchwoman is under masculine control all her life . Until she is twenty-one she is under the control and supervision of her father . After twenty-one , unless she elects to be an old maid , she is under the control and supervision of her husband . American women , used to handling their own affairs and doing pretty much as they please with their own time and possessions , take the right of ownership for granted . But the Frenchwoman of today is still encased in a kind of financial and legal chastity belt , a variation of the old medieval male slogan ; " What 's yours is mine , and what 's mine is my own . " Unless explicitly spelled out in a document we will discuss later , from the day she gets married a French girl owns nothing by herself , not even the clothes on her back . She can not dispose of property or money , even if left to her personally as an inheritance , without her husband 's permission . Early this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account , but she still can not rent or sell anything or incur a debt without his signature . Even if her husband is convicted of a crime , thereby losing his civil rights , she must go to court to get a mandate which will permit her to take the necessary decisions on such joint problems as the home , thechildren , the money or property . And that is not all . She can not engage in a profession to earn any money on the side unless her husband signs her work permit . She can not get a passport without his signature . According to the French Code of Law , she is required to live with him wherever he chooses to live , with or without in-laws . Only if she can prove to a court that the home he chose for her is doing her harm " of a physical or moral nature " can she refuse to live in it without taking the rap for desertion . As a result , unless her husband is putty in her hands  --  which few Frenchmen are  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which her children will be brought up , over their education or the choice of school . Father arranges all , pays all , enrolls the children and signs the report cards . When serious decisions are to be taken , it is the husband who takes them . in a nation in which the question of Catholic or secular education is still hotly debated , this is of immense importance . And the Code Civil does not mince words . " The husband , " it states , " owes protection to his wife , and the wife obedience to her husband . " In everything . Having seen her mother cope with this state of affairs , and perhaps her grandmother and a married sister as well , it is small wonder that the average French girl quickly learns what her few weapons are and how to use them . It is small wonder that when someone asks a Frenchwoman of any age what she would like to eat or drink , she instinctively turns to father , husband or escort for a sign of approval before replying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get what she wants  --  in life , as in a restaurant  --  is by pleasing and manipulating the male . Naturally the men have nothing against this at all , and so are in no hurry to pass legislation to put an end to such a delicious autocracy . Accord ing to most French lawyers I have talked to , the entire problem of women 's rights in France is " a false problem . " " Either they get along , " one of them put it , meaning a married couple , " in which case he does anything she asks him . Or they do n't get along , and so split up and get a divorce . " This lawyer knows as well as I that in France no woman can get a divorce , if her husband opposes it , without running through half a dozen courts , millions of francs and several years . But this lawyer is a happily married man . His wife has learned how to please and manipulate him , and he likes being pleased and manipulated . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . " It is the same with the spending of money . Whereas in the United States women control an estimated 60 per cent of the nation 's buying power , la Franca se wields no such financial force , Most French females receive a set allowance from their fathers or husbands and must make do within its limits . If they want to splurge on something , they must wheedle and cajole , pout or weep , seduce or hold out  --  in short , play the role of Woman . Recently , I must admit , some Frenchwomen seem to be waking up . One in four now insists on having a financial settlement written into her marriage contract , a document that allows her to have some money or property of her own and administer it herself . Yet this one in four is almost invariably an upper-class marriage to which the wife brings considerable wealth , or the second marriage of a woman who remembers . The average young bride never thinks of such things . On their wedding day she and her bridegroom have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal fees for all that financial-settlement jazz . And besides , they 're in love . And who thinks of financial agreements when she 's in love ? As a result , more than 70 per cent of French marriages still take place under the rusty old Napoleonic system of the disinheritance of the wife . Occasionally some technical changes are made in the civil code , but as usual in this unrepentant country , the reforms are not sweeping . The female Declaration of Dependence is needle-pointed into the fabric of French life . Legally and financially , then , the Americaine is infinitely better off than the Francaise . Materialistically too  --  but the American woman knows about that . She knows that with the highest standard of living in the world , she has all other females tremulous with envy of her home , her kitchen , her household appliances , her cars , her clothes and luxuries . In the field of education  --  if one believes in quantity rather than quality  --  she is also far ahead of her French counterpart , with 123,000 American females @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each year in France receiving the college-entrance equivalent of the baccalaur &t.; Consider now the question of health and hygiene . Here the American woman is one of the best informed in the world , the French woman one of the worst . Contrary to popular belief , the French female is not born sophisticated , Most young French girls , even today , are told nothing at all about their physical selves or about the processes of life , but walk into whatever they walk into , ignorant and vulnerable . In a recent Kinsey-type French national poll , 82 per cent of the women questioned admitted that they had been malinformed , misinformed or totally uninformed about sex until it happened to them , The consequences of this are just what you would expect . One French girl in two goes to the altar a virgin , one in four in a shotgun wedding . After that , since there are no Planned Parenthood clinics or federations in France , and contraceptives of any kind are forbidden by law , babies come when babies come . " Rhythm " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two courageous women doctors have tried to start a Women 's Crusade against this tyranny of ignorance . However , like the Children 's Crusade in the early Thirteenth Century , its zeal is praiseworthy , but its accomplishments nil . The abortion racket remains one of the black disgraces of France , a dirty back-alley business that flourishes like a rank weed in every major city , craftily carried on by clumsy old women known in the trade as " angel makers . " Day after day the newspapers teem with stories of girl suicides and babies abandoned in garbage pails or railway stations . There are no statistics , but doctors estimate that in France one pregnancy in four ends in abortion . Add to all this the fact that after a Frenchwoman has borne and reared his children , her husband in dying can still cut her off without so much as a sou to pay for her widow 's weeds . And you will see that from adolescence to old age the Frenchwoman 's security rests solely on her ability to attract and please the male . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not in his will disinherit his wife . In France he can if he wants to  --  but he almost never wants to . This is the other side of the coin , the brighter , shinier side I mentioned earlier . Precisely because she has to please the male in order to survive , la femme Franmise has made pleasing the male her lifelong career . She has taken the one thing she has , her femininity , and made it into an entire way of life for herself and for him . And what 's more , the very challenge of it has exhilarated and inspired her . From our point of view , she is living imprudently , on the razor 's edge of total insecurity . From her point of view , she is at least living . She would like to have some of the rights and privileges the American woman enjoys , the conveniences and services of the American home and the luxury of an American income to spend . But in her heart she feels that somewhere along the line the American woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come out poorer for the bargain . This is not disdain , She simply feels that the American woman , having won her battle for legal and social equality , has become too sure of herself : that she is so used to getting her way without coquetry or playacting or sex that she has let her weapons as a female rust with disuse and now does n't know how to use them . I would not like to take this position myself , but there are those in France who feel that if the Frenchwoman has too little security and too few rights , the American woman has too much and too many , But there is another factor working here . In Europe , where there is not such an unremitting scramble for money and more money and status and more status , the men have time to watch their women and appreciate their performances . They pay attention  --  they are worth playing to . To my mind , this is where the Frenchwoman has a distinct advantage over the American woman , who lacks an audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are spectators to be amused , entertained , attracted . And when there are no men around , she can still go on rehearsing her part for the time when an attentive audience finally materializes , Too often in the United States the male is so busy getting ahead , and so tired after he 's got there , that he has neither the time nor the energy to constitute a good audience . And the female too often is so taken up with homemaking and child rearing and perhaps holding down a job on the side that she has n't the time or energy to play to him . In France , where homemaking and child rearing are not the be-all and end-all of existence , and where getting ahead tends to mean simply holding your own , both audience and actress are forever in place and waiting for the other . When the Bard said , " All the world 's a stage , " he must have been judging by France , where 45,000,000 men and women long ago decided that nothing in life is nearly so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , incidentally , has a lot to do with the French reputation for promiscuity , and also with that endless dress rehearsal for love known as le flirt . Although , in that public-opinion poll I mentioned earlier , one Frariculse in five admitted having been unfaithful to her husband , high infidelity in France is not a serious issue , but simply another manifestation of the French penchant for putting drama into life . And the same goes for flirting . One gets tired of playing the same part for the same audience . So one alters the part a bit and plays it for someone else , sometimes seriously , sometimes not . Love , in France , has much in common with experimental theater . On the shores of the New World there are those who disapprove , who consider the Francaise immoral and self-conscious . Immoral she may or may not be  --  it depends on the individual woman  --  but self-conscious she is always . indeed , it is a rare Frenchwoman of any attractiveness at all who is not constantly aware of herself , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even as she arranges a dozen roses , puts the children to bed or goes through a scene d'amour , some part of her is standing off somewhere observing . Every woman is , I suppose , the repository of a long tradition of femininity that has molded the tastes and preferences of her country . Some women are simply more conscious of this tradition than others are . The American woman , living amidst the comforts and conveniences of February Iii , IPOt the United States in 1961 , has behind her a dual tradition  --  that of the courageous pioneer woman and that of the fragile , clinging Confederate belle . And , whether she realizes it or not , these two female tendencies still exist in her today . The Frenchwoman of today never forgets for an instant that she is the end product of a long and brilliant line of courtesans and queens , adventuresses and chatelaines , saints and shepherd girls who have illuminated the history of France like a procession of meteors across a night sky . Yet she , too , incorporates two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two tendencies can best be illustrated by two heroines of the time of Charles VI - Joan of Arc and Agnes Sorel , the one pious and pure , the other wicked . Joan of Arc was a horny-handed peasant mystic who wanted Charles to fight the English . Agnes Sorel was a luxury-loving and voluptuous little royal mistress who wanted Charles to fight the English . ( Charles fought the English . ) But outside of their agreement on this key point , no two women could have been more dissimilar in appearance , manners , morals and temperament . They were the perfect complement of opposites , for Charles VII or any other man . Contemporaries , they epitomized the two strains that inspire today 's Francalse  --  the saint and the sinner , the mystique and the mistress , the astute peasant and the frivolous courtesan . Both are French heroines , the warrior saint and the spoiled court darling , and both are still revered today  --  Joan for her piety and courage , Agnes for one fabulous nude breast as painted by Fouquet . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer from ready-made historical split personalities . It is only to suggest that female traditions go a great deal further back in both countries than many of us think , and continue to exert a deep influence on both women today . And who knows that the American woman , driving her car to the supermarket and picking up the children and making do without servants , is not unconsciously playing a role too , the role of the capable , strong-minded woman of the expanding frontier ? Who knows but that both women are playing roles handed to them by their men , and both have been molded by the conception their males have had of them over the centuries ? It may be as simple as being what the men want . In comparison with the French , America 's list of heroines is of a paucity indeed , both in quality and quantity . Granted , France has had nine centuries in which to grow legendary women and the United States  --  even including Colonial times  --  but three . But even if one takes only those centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by contrast a tame and colorless bunch . In considering the ideal female of both countries , think what one could deduce by comparing a Betsy Ross with a Ninon de Lenclos , a Carry Nation with a Charlotte Corday , a Harriet Beecher Stowe with a Madame dc Sevigne ! Is it the fault of the democratic form of government that it has evolved no more than a handful of bland , wholesome heroines ? Possibly . Maybe the more flamboyant heroines , like orchids , grow best in fetid , unhealthy climes . But I think it tells us a lot about the temperament of the American woman too . Unlike her selfexpressive French sister , she does n't want to be a heroine or act out a role , she does n't want to lead a life of risk and uncertainty . She wants to get along , and rear her children in the best possible environment , and lead a comfortable life in a pleasant community . Even if she takes on a career , in competition with the men , she wants her benefits and guatanties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Being more security-minded and less adventurous than the Frenchwoman , she will throw away the role for the reality , and be happier for it . Yet if one judges by the dissatisfactions so often heard in America , the neuroses and self-searchings and the high divorce rate ( more than two and a half times that of France ) , one can only conclude that in this one very important way the Frenchwoman is happier than the American : She is making her man happier , and she knows it . If this means spoiling the male , then very well . As one French friend of mine put it , laughing , " Eli Bien , why not ? We spoil them ; so they can spoil us back . " Frenchmen regard this as a very sage attitude for the Frenchwoman to take . 63 They come up with arguments designed to prove that such an attitude gives their women themselves , and society as a whole , great advantages . And in truth it does have its advantages for everyone , not the least of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in France . Peace between the sexes is wonderful , and both men and women want to prolong it as long as they can . It is in this sense that the Frenchwoman has it better than the American woman . As for the ma
