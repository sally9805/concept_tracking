This season NBC is programming 70% of its nighttime shows in color . But it turns out that this is a mere drop on the palette . Proud as its peacock , NBC announced that next September it will become the " Full-Color Network . " <P> That was boasting a bit . Actually it will be the " 96% Prime-Time Color Network , " but who 's counting ? Next fall , from 7:30 to 11 , seven nights a week , NBC will be kaleidoscopically ablaze with 14 old shows and 13 new . Then the only off-color notes will be sounded by I Dream of Jeannie for a half-hour , Convoy for an hour , and an occasional feature film . Jeannie will have light grey hair , because Jeannie is a genie , and getting her out of a bottle is a ponderous camera trick in color ; Convoy will be deflowered because it incorporates black-and-white wartime film clips . Otherwise the prime-time rainbow will be unblemished . And off prime time , NBC will continue to colorcast the Johnny Carson Show and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started in 1954 , NBC managed to grind out only a pale 68 color hours for the year . For the 1965-66 schedule , that total will be 3,000 . <P> The color explosion has hit the opposition too . ABC has been colorcasting three series , as well as some movies and specials . Next season , although one will be dropped , three new series , Gidget , The FBI Story and Big Valley , will join the color lineup . At CBS-TV President John Schneider , in his premire pronouncement at his new post , took his network into the wonderful world of color for the first time on a series basis . Red Skelton and Danny Kaye will both be tinted in the fall . And having caved in to prime-time movies , CBS will color the ones Hollywood colored . <P> As for NBC 's parent company , the Radio Corporation of America , color it green . Under the prod of Board Chairman David Sarnoff , 74 , the company sank $130 million into color TV before getting a penny out . Now RCA manufactures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated 3,000,000 color sets ( which start at about $380 ) now in use in the U.S. , and with the new NBC schedule as a come-on , the number is expected to jump to 5,000,000 by 1966 . <P> Color TV is RCA 's leading consumer product in volume of sales , and the clutch of future orders has already backlogged . What 's more , the American Research Bureau reports that in color-equipped homes , NBC flays the opposition with every tinted offering . All of which , of course , explains the ecstatic cry over hue at NBC .
