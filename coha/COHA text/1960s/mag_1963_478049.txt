HISTORY , " Napoleon said , " is a myth agreed upon . " The remark seems to prove that whatever other opportunities for extensive acquaintance were open to the Emperor of the French , he did not know many historians , for myth-makers they may be , but herdlike unanimity of opinion is not a charge that can be leveled against them with justice . Probably no historian has attempted to make of Nero a model son or of Henry VIII a devoted husband , but except where the facts are invincible few leaders or events in the past have escaped divergent interpretation . Schoolboys may still enjoy the comforts of a brilliant chiaroscuro world of Good Kings and Bad Kings . but the adult reader finds his way by no such certain landmarks . Beyond all the incidental diversity of interpretation that marks the work of historians there is one great disagreement that divides the whole tribe into two camps . In one camp are those who think that what happens in this world is somehow inevitable , determined , beyond human control . To be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the determining ? it may be economics or race or geography , or it may be some biological principle in societies that drives them from scedtime to flowering and then to decay , or it may be some mysterious force that chains them to a great wheel turning with massive and imperturbable automatism through endless ages . Historical inevitability may provide grounds for optimism , by proving that the future is on our side , or for pessimism , by proving that it is against us , but it always contains at bottom what may be the ultimate human comfort in most situations ? the reassurance that whatever happens it is not our fault . In the other camp are the historians who believe that the choices men make influence the course of events . They do not rule out contingency : they recognize that the difference between the Eskimos and the English has something to do with the fact that one group lives in a cold climate and the other on an island , they recognize that abundant natural resources have given the United States advantages Japan has lacked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrow place of necessity different men have behaved differently , and that the difference has had consequences . When things are going well , this kind of history can display the faults of complacency and self-congratulation , but because it is based on the assumption that men are free , it contains the nasty threat , when disaster strikes , that we may be responsible . Most historians who believe in freedom do not bother to define it ; they simply assume that the Bad Kings could have been Good if they had put their minds to it , and go on from there . But Herbert J. Muller , who has just published Freedom in the Western World ( Harper &; Row , $8.50 ) , the second volume in his projected History of Freedom , is more conscientious . He offers a definition of freedom that goes on for half a page , then confesses uneasily that the history of freedom may be in fact the history of civilization , and from a review of the previous volume in his series he quotes resignedly the opinion that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefatory agonizing is somewhat beside the point , because when it conies to what actually has happened , Moller sees freedom as a much simpler thing than his definition suggests . It would be too narrow to say that he equates freedom with civil rights , but it would hardly be unjust to say that he sees it as the spirit or temper that has made the extension of civil rights possible . Perhaps this is the only kind of freedom the historian can concern himself with . Certainly he can not " prove " that anyone a thousand years ago could have done something other than what he did ; indeed , as Tolstoy pointed out , the more remote an action the more inevitable it seems ? it would be a bold and possibly useless exercise of the imagination to try to picture what the world would he like if ( say ) the American Revolution had been put down . Nor can the historian " prove " that the amount of subjective freedom men have felt has been greater or less at one time or another ; whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a greater sense of doing what they wanted to do than the 100 THE NEW BOOKS men who accompanied Eisenhower on his Crusade it is simply impossible to say . So , of the many men that Muller discusses ( his account covers Western Europe and America in the years 1000 to 1800 , with a detour through Islam ) , it is hardly surprising that the two he writes of with the greatest geniality of feeling are Erasmus and Montaigne . Both were tolerant , skeptical , undoctrinaire men , equally distant from the martyr and the inquisitor , speculative and ironical . Such a temperament admits disagreement and acknowledges the right of others to live their lives by their own standards ; it is certainly the temperament that encourages the growth of civil rights . The fact that Muller admires and shares this cast of mind accounts for both the strength and the disappointments of his book . It is disappointing because the history of freedom turns out to be not very different from the history most Americans have grown up with , at least if their texts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the history of freedom is seen as the history of tolerance , it is something less than the history of civilization and quite possible to write ; in fact it has been written many times . At the same time it is Muller 's strength that he is not afraid to say what has been said before . When a man knows as much as he does , it would not be difficult to twitch the material into some new and arresting shape . Muller has steadfastly resisted that temptation . His book will give rise to no cult , will beget no editorials . Yet it will do a good deal . For the novice it will provide an introduction to the growth of a great tradition ; for the more experienced reader it will serve as a reminder . And not merely as a reminder , because , though the book espouses no new scheme of history , it is full of vigorous judgments and fresh opinions , and where the traditional textbook version of the growth of tolerance tends to see the process as an institutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its broad cultural setting . His reading is immense ; he seems equally at home with the account books of Renaissance businessmen and French tragedy . Several of the connections he draws are new to me : he suggests , for instance , that what it is now the fashion to call the Protestant ethic had its origins in the medieval monastery , with its emphasis on regularity , order , and hard work . Occasionally Muller betrays a lark of sympathy with what lies outside the tradition he admires . He speaks , for instance , of the Cambridge Platonist Henry More as " given to mysticism , " as if mysticism were a rather odd personal habit . something like drinking papaya juice . In his criticisms of the Catholic Church , he makes adroit use of the remarks of Lord Acton , whose own history of freedom , perhaps the mostfamous unwritten book of recent times , could not be executed , Muller suggests , because Acton could not square his commitment to the Church with his commitment to liberalism . In one peculiar passage Muller refers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which suggests that his seemingly unlimited knowledge of the kingdoms of this world stops short of the lower reaches of Terpsichore 's realm . Such lapses , however , are the merest smudges on an eloquent , learned , and convinced account of one of the most awe-inspiring developments in human history : the creation of an atmosphere in which men accord one another the dignity , and expose one another to the danger , of responsibility for their own actions . SCHEMATIC HISTORY The Precarious Balance ( Knopf , $5.95 ) is an essay on the struggle for power in Europe in the last few centuries , by a distinguished elderly German historian , Ludwig Dehio . A good deal of this book is written in the language of determinism : in a characteristic passage , for instance , Dehio speaks of Spain as " fated " to become a " continental power " ( as distinguished from a sea power ) , and other nations are spoken of as if they were playing roles that had already been written and assigned to them by some supernatural playwright . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says " the guns went off of their own accord , " though presumably the remark is meant to be somewhat figurative . The theme of the book too has a strongly deterministic cast ; it is , very briefly , that in the struggles of recent centuries the continental or land-based countries of Europe have been at a disadvantage when confronted by island or sea-based powers . This thesis , like many other efforts at sweeping geographical ( or other ) explanations of historical events , requires a certain amount of juggling to accommodate the facts . Venice has to he an island to fit the scheme , and Holland partly an island . Then as time moves nearer the present , the terminology breaks clown completely : , because nobody can pretend that Russia is an island , and so " island powers " are replaced by " flanking powers " ( England and Russia ) , until the very end when the United States emerges as the new island power and Russia as the new continental power . A reader expects Dehio 's book to end in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second world war on the grounds that as a continental power surrounded by island ( or flanking ) powers , it never had a chance . But nothing of the sort emerges . Instead , the language of determinism disappears as the book progresses , and the identification of Russia and the United States as the new continental and island powers THE NEW BOOKS seems to be nothing more than a rhetorical convenience to round it oft . Certainly , Dehio , unlike his deterministic countrymen Marx and Spengler , is completely unwilling to base any prediction of the future on the scheme he has constructed . What then , one wonders , was the point of constructing it in the first place ? The only possible answer seems to be that a learned and thoughtful German historian . after a lifetime of study , can still regard as news the idea that Western Europe has no effective Monroe Doctrine . Surely no American reader who knows anything about William III , Marlborough , Wellington , or the two world wars of this century , will be startled by such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the subtler points in Dehio 's exposition assume a better-informed reader than I have been able to provide , though I am quite competent to appreciate the remarkable late-Baroque figures of speech with which he has ornamented his pages . MEN WITHOUT HISTORY ONCE it was said that people whi , had no history were to be congratulated on their lack . Such an opinion reflected the general idea that people in a state of nature ? noble savages ? lived together in simple trust and affection without all the artificiality , pretension , and strife that our social institutions create . Now the anthropologists have destroyed all that . As they have carried out investigations of how primitive people actually live , they have discovered that ( with very occasional exceptions ) these people are bound by more ritual , more complex taboos and demands than we are . The one advantage primitive people once had was the advantage of ignorance ? they did not know that life could be lived in arr , other way than their own ? but sum ) there will be few if any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inevitability of their own style of life . One way of looking at the history of freedom as Muller recounts it is to see it as a growth in the belief in unrealized possibilities , the conviction that life need not be lived exactly as it is lived in this particular village . 102 THE NEW BOOKS Peter Matthiessen 's Under the Mountain Wall ( Viking , $7.50 ) is , as the subtitle says , ' ' a chronicle of two seasons in the stone age . " * Matthiessen was a member of the 1961 Ilaryard-Peabody expedition to the interior of New Guinea , an expedition that received wide newspaper publicity because of the death of another member , Michael Rockefeller . Matatiessell is not an anthropologist and he has not chosen to imitate the anthropologist 's style of presenting his material . Instead of offering a series of chapters on kinship . warfare , shelter , weapons , language , songs . and so on , he has presented a sequence of scenes in which the Knreht ( the New Guinea tribe the expedition studied ) go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this method ; it is not easy . for instance , to understand exactly who is fighting whom in the incessant warfare , because there is little exposition of the tribal structure . Sonic facts remain hazy ? it looks as if the Kurelu had no tool made of anything more durable than wood except for the stone adze , but Matthiessen never says so . A more serious difficulty is that Matthiessen writes of the Kureht as if there were no white observer present . as if they were still living entirely in the self-confidence of their stone-age isolation , but obviously they had to he under the observation of an outsider for the hook to be written , and the outsider 's presence most have altered their behavior if only a little bit . But the disadvantages of Matthiessen 's method are outweighed by its advantages , to a large extent simply because he is such a superb writer . He can describe a child tending pigs , an old man in the last stages of senility , the proud face of a warrior , the tropical landscape at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangeness of the ! Curettes society : instead it assumes that the kind of life described makes perfect sense , as presumably it does to the Kurelu , and in time the reader begins to share the feeling . The distance between these naked savages and the reader diminishes ; * " The Death of Weake " ? adapted from this book ? appeared in Harper 's ( October 1962 ) . he realizes how much of the business of life is everywhere the same : the competition of the men for eminence , the jealousy of the women , the constant threat of death and the celebration of its mystery . Yet few readers will regret the blood-stained centuries that do in fact separate us from the stone age . The endless round of protocol and symbolic gesture that occupies the Kurelu may be no more elaborate than our own , but it certainly seems harsher . The custom of cutting off the fingers of little Kurelu girls as a sign of mourning is only the most repulsive example . In all of Matthiessen 's account I came across only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the women get up first and go about their work in the early morning , while the men lie abed until the day has warmed up . Under the Ifouniain Wall should become something of a classic . It combines the scientist 's precise observation with the artist 's tact and grace and sympathy . There are many fine photographs to illustrate the text . A SHAMFFUL HISTORY ANOTHER fascinating recent book is the history of the Atlantic slave trade by Daniel P. Mannix and Malcolm Cowley , Black Cargoes ( Viking , S6,95 ) . It is not a book to be read by those with queasy stomachs , for the facts are horrible beyond anything the standard American histories have led one to expect ( at sea a slaving vessel could he smelled five miles downwind ) , but it is a devastating revelation of what people will do for money . If the Kurelu whom Matthiessen describes could read Blark Cargoes , they would probably decide that any incidental harshness they engage in looks pretty gentle in comparison with the organi/ed and methodical exploitation of human beings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West for nearly four hundred years , and they would be right . The scale of the slave trade was almost unbelievable . Millions of people were involved and sums of money that even today seem immense . The trade permeated society far beyond the areas where slaveswere used for labor . The English coin called a guinea took its name from the name generally applied to the African slave coast ; it was coined by Charles II to popularize a slaving company in which he had invested . Boston 's Fanettil Hall , " the cradle of liberty , " was built by a man part of whose fortune came from the trade . Wall Street in New York takes its name from a wall the Dutch built to keep their Indian slaves in and the slaves ' relatives nut . ( Indians made poor slaves anyway . ) Liverpool honored the trade in slaves and ivory that provided its wealth by ornamenting the town hall with tusks and heads of " blackamoors " cut in stone . Some economists have suggested that profits from the slave trade financed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details of the story , one is struck by how quickly in human institutions the fortuitous comes to seem inevitable , necessary , and therefore right . Within a few years after the trade started , the African kings who sold their captives and sometimes their subjects into slavery had become dependent on the European goods they got in exchange ; the entrepreneurs of the Caribbean , Brazil , and the Southern colonies had set systems of production that demanded cheap labor ; the traders of Old and New England and some other countries had established patterns of economic exchange in which slaves were an essential link . The early abolitionists of England ( the country that both profited most from the slave trade and did the most to abolish it ) shrewdly countered economic argument with economic argument : they pointed out that the trade was ruining British sailors on whom the country depended for its prosperity and safety . The argument was just : sailors were often treated worse than slaves , because they were a liability ( had to be paid ) when a ship reached port , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not alive and well enough to be sold . Probably the worst feature , and certainly the most enduring feature , of the Atlantic slave trade was racism . Originally African Negroes were simply indentured servants like many whites who came to the early colonies ; they would serve for a peTHE NEW BOOKS riod of years or perhaps for life , but their children would be free . With the growth of perpetual servitude as an institution there also grew up a concomitant ideology that the African was fit for nothing more . Today that ideology , outlasting by a century the institution it was created to defend , is one of the nastiest things we have to deal with . POSTSCRIPT Melvin r . Lasky 's Africa for Beginners ( Lippincott , $3.50 ) largely concerns Ghana and Nigeria , the chief modern nations that have emerged in recent years on the old " guinea " coast where most of the slaves for the Atlantic trade came from , with an additional chapter on Ethiopia and the Sudan . Lasky gives his book the subtitle " a traveler 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are snippets from the local press in countries he visited , interviews with politicians and intellectuals and students , odds and ends of observation of buildings , clothes , manners , and everything else under the sun . All of this is interesting and some of it highly amusing . An editorial from a Nigerian newspaper advocating the nationalization of witchcraft is a masterpiece of unconscious humor ; it is delightful to read about earnest intellectuals discussing the evils of excessively high prices for brides . Yet one wonders if collecting t his hodgepodge of detail is as just a way of dealing with these hard ? iressed new nations as they deserve . Tf a traveler came to America for a few weeks and talked in rapid succession with Norman Mailer , Mrs. Richard Nixon , Tennessee Williams , Robert Hutchins , and William Buckley , Jr. , he might be able to put together a group of interviews that would show the United States as a country of absurd contradictions impossible to reconcile . He probably could not find an editorial advocating the nationalization of witchcraft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proving that witchcraft should not be nationalized . There is an instructive anecdote to this point in Evelyn Waugh 's most recent travel book . He tells of going out to visit the region in East Africa where the postTHE NEW war British government attempted to raise groundnuts on a vast scale . After seeing the monumental waste there , Waugh dryly remarks that if such a scheme had been undertaken by any African nation , it would have been regarded as conclusive evidence that the natives were not yet ready for self-government . All this is not to say that Africa for Beginners is not worth reading . It is both instructive and entertain-Mg. a collection of observations by a man of acute intelligence , and a useful antidote to a certain kind of blandly reassuring writing that new nations often seem to occasion . Yet a reader who comes to it from the sordid story recounted in Black Cargoes , who realizes how recent the experience of shameless exploitation has been for these African regions , can not help hoping for a reporter with a less darting and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Monarchy by Harold Nicolson ( Simon and Schuster , $12.50 ) is somewhere between a gift book and serious history . The volume has been lavishly produced ? with abundant handsome illustrations , many in color ? and elegantly though faultily printed . Nicolson sees himself as the chronicler of a dying trade ; twice he remarks ( he says a number of things more than once ) that in his lifetime he has witnessed the removal of eight emperors , twelve kings , and fifteen minor dynasties . Since he is a man of aristocratic sentiment but democratic principle , he seems not to lait-tent their passing very much , though he leaves no doubt that in its constitutional monarchy England has achieved the best of all possible political worlds . Kings , Courts , and Monarchv is a chronological account of rulers from prehistoric times to Elizabeth H. It has little if anything new to say about monarchy as an institution , but it offers a good deal of picturesque detail , a certain amount of political analysis , numerous strong opinions , considerable wit and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtful . For sustained malice nothing else in the book can touch the BOOKS account of Muhammad , but for an incidental example Nicolson 's remark that Charlemagne was too manly to interest Gibbon will do well enough . The generalizations include the proposition that short men tend to be very suspicious and that tall men who are Left-handed tend to be impotent . The source of these useful bits of information is not divulged . The fun in Kings , Courts , and Monarchy ? and in spite of this per-haps jaundiced report , it is an en-gaging book ? is the fun of listening to the urbane talk of a worldly . widely experienced and widely read , rather cynical and highly opinionated man . UNDER the title The Fate of the Edsel ( Harper &; Row , $4.50 ) John Brooks has brought together a group of essays on recent business history . They are concerned with a variety of subjects ? Clarence Saunders , founder of the Piggly-Wiggly stores , the first supermarkets ; Walter K. Gutman , an art critic turned investment counselor ; the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegant banks ; and what the price-fixing scandals in the electrical industry reveal about the structure of large corporations ? but the best chapters are those that give the book its mune , the amazing story of how the Ford Motor Company lost $.350 million in an attempt to launch a new make of automobile . Just what that story proves it is not easy to say . Some have thought it demonstrates the uselessness of consumer research , but from Brooks 's account it appears that the extensive use of such research in developing the Edsel was often misguided in conception , and in practice disregarded in favor of some executive 's hunch . For instance , after thousands of possible names for the car had been collected from many sources , including Marianne Moore , and some had been tested for their effect on prospective buyers , all were thrown out at the last minute in favor of a name that had apparently been discarded months before , simply because someone whose word " went " wanted to call the car the Edsel . Perhaps the most the account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , and of that the I05 THE NEW contemporary world already has a good deal of evidence . Brooks tells his stories in a jaunty journalistic style , with a sharp eye for detail and considerable feeling for the personalities involved . THE . NEW DETERMINISM Ni A N Y people who would reject out of hand any kind of historical determinism of society nevertheless have come to accept a kind of determinism of the individual based upon IQ , aptitude , and achievement tests . Since the introduction of large-scale testing in the first world war , it has become a major American industry , with a powerful voice ( often the final voice ) in deciding not only who gets into what school or college but also who gets what jobs in business , industry , the civil service , and so on . Now such testing is becoming increasingly popular abroad . The power and prevalence of testing have been challenged by several books ? The Organization Man and They 've Got Your Number are among the best ? and Banesh Hoffmann has recently produced another excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crowell-Collier , $3.95 ) . This book will be of special interest to readers of Harper 's , because much of it grew out of correspondence he had as a consequence of an article published in this magazine in March 1961 . Most of Hoffmann 's criticisms are directed against the kind of questions asked on machine-marked tests , especially the very common multiple-choice questions . Through painstaking analysis of sample questions he shows that some questions which seem obvious to a superficial reader in fact present grave difficulties to the person of acute intelligence , the very person whom the test is designed to discover . Not all the examples are completely convincing , but most are , and anyone with experience in such matters can add examples of his own . The problems raised by Hoffmann 's book are very grave , and can not be solved simply by making the tests better . We have a society that attempts to recognize and encourage ind reward merit , and we have no Lure way of identifying it . Perhaps he reason is that merit does not BOOKS exist : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , some another . What we must avoid is the exclusive emphasis on one kind of gift . For some time " intelligence " has ruled the roost among the testers . Now ' creativity " is coming into style , and before long we will have , if we do not have already , tests to locate a quality or gift that is even more untestable than intelligence . Tests should be improved ; in many instances they should be done away with . But over the years I have seen students selected for college admission , for scholarships and fellowships , by almost every system the human mind has devised , and I have found none of them satisfactory . All ways of making choice among human beings are arbitrary . We can and should endeavor to reduce the arbitrariness , but in the end we have to recognize it and live with it . AN OTHER book that undertakes to locate weaknesses in American education is The Community of Scholars by Pau ? Goodman ( Random House , . $3.95 ) , an attempt to discover why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they should be . Like most of Goodman 's work , this book is a mixture of stimulating ideas , acute observations , and nonsense ; and since it would take another book somewhat longer than the one he has written to distinguish among them , one example must suffice . Goodman argues ( or perhaps the word is pontificates ) that college teachers should be " veterans , " men who have had a period of experience outside the college in the fields they teach and who , when they turn to teaching , continue to carry on work in those fields , so that their students can be in effect their apprentices . It is a fine idea in some areas , especially the fine arts , hot it is not easy to see what kind of practical experience would be available to e man who teaches Russian literature or genetics or history of music . Furthermore , Goodman wants the colleges more independent of society . and a faculty composed of men employed part-time in the community would be in no position to encourage independence ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from administrators , but men already busy with two jobs would not be able to give much time to college government . It could be argued that too many college teachers , at least at the larger institutions , already devote an excessive amount of time to outside work , to advising business or government , or doing their research . At present , thanks largely to National Science Foundation grants , the apprentice system is fairly well developed among science students , with rather mixed results . Goodman is right , of course , that college faculties are not the communities of scholars they ought to he , but how many of his suggestions would advance their establishment is another matter .
