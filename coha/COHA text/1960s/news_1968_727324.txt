txt The American terms for ending the bombing of North Vietnam are slowly easing . As the Democratic Pafty leans further this way , President Johnson 's government is moving in the same direction , but more cautiously . The hardening of the American line which began with the recent Honolulu conference has now been replaced with a noticeably more receptive approach . The Democratic convention at Chicago will be concerned with appealing to voters who are generally weary and disenchanted with the Vietnam war and who have been led to believe there are ways out . But President Johnson holds the responsibility for bargaining with Hanoi and has to be more careful . Beyond him stands the Republican candidate , Richard M. Nixon , who is likely to take a stiffer position on terms for ending the bombing . So Washington , as well as Chicago , is seething with argument and maneuver on this very sensitive question . It adds up to a significant leftward movement toward terms that Hanoi hopefully might accept  --  but with the Johnson administration trying to avert a rout and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson administration has taken these steps , publicly and in private : 1 . It has announced that despite the " escalation " by North Vietnam in recent months , the United States will not increase its ceiling for the American forces there . 2 . It has emphasized that the American forces are no longer on the attack . They have switched from the " search and destroy " strategy to one of " spoiling attacks " that are essentially defensive and intended to break up attack formations of the enemy when they are poised to strike . 3 . It is again stressing the ease with which Hanoi can give the United States a signal which would give a basis for ending the bombing . Mr. Johnson 's request for " almost anything " which had dropped out of sight since last year is now back in a fashion in actual use . It would probably be enough for Hanoi to state that it will not launch the offensive it has seemed to be preparing . It is not necessary , at this stage , for Hanoi to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deescalation of March 31. 4 . The way is being quietly prepared for Hanoi to give President Johnson , privately , a basis for " assuming " that it would not take military advantage of an end to the bombing . The last point , possibly the most important of all , can not be spelled out by newsmen here . But it is known to exist . Should Hanoi decide to offer private assurances , and should Mr. Johnson decide they are adequate , the American people would have to assume that the President knew what he was doing and that he had a basis for acting . Flexibility stressed In sum : The Johnson administration still wants Hanoi to provide a " basis for assuming " that North Vietnam would not follow up with a devastating series of attacks , for which it now is prepared , if the President lifted the bombing . But " this kind of signal would be so easy for them to give , " as Defense Secretary Clark Clifford put it . It was Mr. Clifford who went out of his way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large , was " in the main a reinforcement " to compensate for killed , wounded , desertions , etc. , and was not a significant enlargement of the total Communist forces in South Vietnam . The President and his top officials are not holding out for any rigid formula as they seemed to do in periods of hard line . Hanoi has a wide range of choices . It can use language that has not been specified by Washington ? so that the negotiation would- not be tripped up by semantics . The government here has carefully refrained from defining or listing moves by Hanoi that would be satisfactory on this end , lest this inhibit the North Vietnamese leaders . The intention is to leave them as free as possible to adopt any reasonable course for giving Mr. Johnson the basis to assume that he can stop the bombing without risking his soldiers ' lives . If this were not enough to ease the path // * Johnson eases Viet peace terms // for Hanoi , the administration has been letting it be known that it is impressed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Paris talks have been carried forward on a very free basis , going into substantive matters that Hanoi might well have refused to discuss , until the bombing was ended . Each side has been exposed to the views of the other . There is also an implication that although Hanoi was ready to launch its next offensive last month , it did not do so . Role obscure The role that American public opinion and campaign politics have played in this slow but distinct movement toward an accommodation with Hanoi is hard to measure . There is a wide difference of opinion in official as well as unofficial circles here over the extent to which the American electorate is committed to deescalation . Liberals incline to say this major shift of opinion since last winter is irreversible . Conservatives doubt it and expect trouble and hard bargaining from Hanoi . But the political pressures are in no doubt . Vice-President Hubert H. Humphrey has told associates and newsmen that he wants assurance of " restraint and reasonable response " from Hanoi . But he also gives the impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " himself and is reaching out for a basis for ending the bombing , rather than holding back and stiffening his terms as the bargaining progresses . He has the problem of keeping the **25;316;TOOLONG forces " within the house of the Democratic Party , " as he puts it . Whether he would need significantly to move away from the Johnson position to reach compromise on a Vietnam plank for the platform is not clear . But the fact that the President 's men now appear eager to see Hanoi speak out and appear themselves to reach out for settlement rather than hold back , holding the door wider for Hanoi to come through , may be a straw in the wind . It is almost as if President Johnson , who appeared to stiffen his position toward Hanoi at the Honolulu conference of last month , was now leaning over to the other side of his policy , that of eagerness to move into the next stage of negotiation at Paris . He is known to think that once Hanoi has passed the present pressure point involving the decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another barricade and intrench itself there . But this is taken here as an expectable part of the bargaining process and al- though a future danger , not necessarily a fatal one . Only after the Chicago convention will it be learned whether this is a tactical swing or a definite move by Mr. Johnson to hold the door wider open for Hanoi .
