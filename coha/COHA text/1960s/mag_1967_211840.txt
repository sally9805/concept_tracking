The earth shook to the roar of can non and the bite of heavy treads as German-built Leopard tanks and tank destroyers , more than 100 strong , staged a mock panzer battle at the Bundeswehr proving grounds at Munsterlager . <P> The real hostilities , however , were in the reviewing stand . There stood a bristling Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger and his angry Defense Minister , Gerhard Schroder . In a split that has ended eight months of harmony in the coalition Cabinet , Kiesinger and Schrder , both Christian Democrats , were embattled over projected cuts in West Germany 's defense budget . <P> Not Amused . The Bundeswehr 's 456,000 men constitute the strongest and best-equipped NATO force on the Continent , are deployed in the first layer of defense along the Iron Curtain from Schleswig-Holstein to Bavaria . Bonn 's plans called for an expansion of the Bundeswehr over the next few years , but Kiesinger 's Cabinet , worried about the economic slowdown in West Germany , two weeks ago decided to cut military expansion plans by about 25% . When a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cabinet was meeting , Interior Minister Paul Lcke cracked : " Schroder is calling out his Starfighters against us . " Schroder was not amused . " No , " he replied icily , " that must be the Americans pulling out . " <P> When he was overruled , Schrder carried his fight from the Defense Ministry , newly housed in a gleaming complex above the Rhine that has inevitably been nicknamed the Pentabonn , into the public arena . He leaked to the press that the cuts would mean a reduction of 60,000 men in the German army . The calculation was his own and not necessarily accurate , since the reductions could be taken in equipment as well as men . Still , the ensuing headlines brought the desired result . Washington , irritated that Kiesinger had not informed it in advance of the budget reduction , let it be known that it firmly opposed any cut in German military strength , especially since it hopes to recall some U.S. troops from Germany. * Defense Secretary Robert McNamara canceled a trip to West Germany ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Holding a Grudge . Kiesinger was furious . He went on TV to disavow Schroder , saying that " the Cabinet has by no means decided to cut the troop strength of the Bundeswehr to a considerable de gree , let alone by 60,000 men . " While overall cutbacks will be made in projected defense budgets through 1971 , he said , the defense budget for the next four years will actually be larger than at present . Kiesinger was joined by Finance Minister Franz Josef Strauss , who holds a grudge against <P> Schroder for fingering him , when Schroder was Foreign Minister , as the man who ordered the arrest of an edi tor in the 1962 Der Spiegel scandal . The ambitious Strauss , who aims at the chancellorship for himself one day and sees Schroder as a rival , accused Schroder of misleading the German public with " lies and deliberate propaganda .
