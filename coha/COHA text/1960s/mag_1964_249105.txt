IT is hard for us to think of two subjects that go together better than R. Buckminster Fuller and Boris Artzybasheff . " I ca n't remember when I enjoyed working on a TIME cover more , " said Artist Artzybasheff , after he had finished painting Designer Fuller with a background that includes Fuller 's radome , Dymaxion Car , tensegrity octahedron , an example of energetic-synergetic geometry , the 4D apartment house , a Dymaxion mobile laboratory , a demonstration of the omniequilateral , omnitriangulated finite system , and the 15 axes interconnecting opposite mid-points of the icosahedron 's 30 edges . But all this , being very Artzybasheffesque , was topped by the opportunity to do Fuller 's head in the pattern of his most successful invention-the geodesic dome . " It was , " said Boris , " a simple , wonderful challenge of breaking up his head like that and still have it come out a likeness ! " <P> The correspondent who did most of the reporting on the story emerged with the same attitude . " Nobody could be more challenging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Chicago Correspondent Miriam Rumwell . " I did n't know what to say for the first five hours-I just listened . He spills out amazing ideas and insights so fast . Even though you may not fully understand what he said , you feel you ought to . By osmosis , you eventually catch on . " During one interview . Fuller did his flamenco-type dance for Miriam . During another , in a small plane bouncing into St. Louis in a snowstorm , he sought to calm her by saying : " Relax ; just give way to love . " <P> Miriam hastened to add that Mrs. Fuller was along on the flight , and that " he meant love for everything , love for what was happening at the moment , love of ' livingry ' - one of his Fullermade words . " <P> In New York , the story was researched by Nancy Gay Faber , written by Douglas Auchincloss and edited by A. T. Baker . We hope you 'll think it 's fun too . <P> Two sections of TIME this week tackle areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a survey of the top U.S. dailies , a list that perhaps unfortunately-since it is such a standard number-added up to ten . The story is the result of long and friendly ( as well as critical ) consideration of U.S. newspapers by the whole editorial staff . It involved a close study of newspapers all over the U.S. by correspondents and editors , and a sustained dialogue between correspondents and Press Editor John Koffend and Senior Editor Richard Seamon . While it was literally impossible to draft a precise set of criteria on which to measure one newspaper against another-since the communities they serve differ so widely-there was one central question that had overriding importance : Has the community in which this newspaper is published been measurably changed for the better by this newspaper , and if so , how ? <P> The other wide survey is the WORLD BUSINESS section 's study of the international economy , which called for reporting from TIME correspondents in Washington , London , Paris , Bonn , Rome , Athens , Cairo , Beirut , Istanbul , Teheran , Tokyo , Nairobi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sydney and Moscow . Their reports , analyzed by Writer Everett Martin and Senior Editor Edward L. Jamieson , added up to an encouraging conclusion about the trend of the economy in the free world .
