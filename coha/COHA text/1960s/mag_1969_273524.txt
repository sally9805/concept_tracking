The 57-year-old New Yorker in Manhattan 's Memorial Hospital had an incurable and inoperable brain cancer . After he lapsed into a month-long coma and his brothers knew that he was dying , they decided to let the hospital remove as many organs as possible for transplants in the hope of prolonging life for others . Last week , when the unidentified patient died , a huge surgical complex , which had been on standby alert for a week , moved into swift and multiple action . <P> Memorial 's medical director , Dr. Edward Beattie , called on New York Hospital 's surgeon-in-chief , Dr. C. Walton Lillehei , to send for the organs that his staff could use . While the body was perfused with oxygenated blood to ward off tissue degeneration , Lillehei 's assistants removed the eyes for fresh-cornea transplants , both kidneys and the heart , and rushed them by underground tunnels to waiting surgery teams . Within a few hours , the Lillehei group had transplanted the heart ( into a 36-year-old man ) , both kidneys and one cornea-the second cornea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the donor 's liver and the enormously enlarged , cancerous liver of Caroline Varney , 27 , a bride of six months . This transplant took far longer than the heart . Not only are the liver 's anatomical connections more difficult , but Mrs. Varney 's diseased liver presented special problems . At week 's end , all four recipients of organs from this six-way surgical achievement seemed to be doing well . The Varney family , like the donor 's brothers , hoped that the achievement would encourage others to arrange similar multiple donations .
