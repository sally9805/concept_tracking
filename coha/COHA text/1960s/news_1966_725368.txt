txt Letters to the Editor of The Times pg . 32 Letters to the Editor of The Times safeguard against disastrously low wage competition . The " percentage increase " formula does not wipe out or even narrow the advantage of Puerto Rico as a competitor , but it does mean that a measure of balance between stateside and island wages is sought by moving up the Puerto Rican minimums , at least percentage-wise , at the same rate as those on the mainland . The proposed amendment this year is almost an exact duplicate of the last law calling for the same kind of percentage increases . There is only one difference : the present proposal would close a loophole whereby a few employers tried to avoid the purpose of the law by asking for certain special privileges in the form of exemptions from the percentage increase . Gus TYLER Assistant President International Ladies ' Garment Workers ' Union New York , March 8 , 1966 ? Inflation in Vietnam To the Editor : To those of us who were In China during the years just before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a disturbingly familiar ring . This ring is especially ominous when we read , in The New York Times of Feb. 20 , that the cost of living in Vietnam has risen 50 per cent since the beginning of last year . One of the principal causes of the easy victory of the Communists in China was the runaway inflation , which destroyed both material and moral values . As much as any other factor , the inflation contributed to the widespread dissatisfaction with the Government and the general air of defeatism prevalent in 1948 and 1949 . Dr. Arthur N. Young , former financial adviser to China , in Further reproduction prohibited without permission . Minimum Wage Formula for Puerto Rico To the Editor : I should like to comment on your March 8 news story in which is discussed the attitude of Gov . Roberto Sanchez Vilella with regard to pending minimum wage legislation . The story states that " Congress has heretofore let Puerto Rico apply minimum wages industry by industry , based on ability to pay . " The story also notes that the Puerto Rican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each industry instead of being fixed rigidly by Congress for all industries . " It would be unfortunate if the implication were read into this that present proposed bills seek a uniform and rigid minimum wage for all of Puerto Rico 's industries regardless of their ability to pay . Proposed Legislation There is no such proposed legislation . Pending bills recognize that different industries in Puerto Rico have differing problems and are not to operate on a uniform minimum . Proposed legislation would merely raise the island minimums by the same percentage as the continental minimums if and when a new Federal minimum is enacted . For example : if the present Federal minimum wage were raised from $1.25 an hour to $1.40 an hour ( an increase of 12 per cent ) , then a Puerto Rican industry such as handsewing of fabric gloves , where the present minimum is 30 cents an hour , would have to pay a minimum of 33.6 cents an hour ( the same 12 per cent increase ) , while another Puerto Rican industry such as banking , where the minimum wage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum . of $1.40 an hour . A similar " percentage " in3rease formula was written into the Federal minimum wage law thanges in 1961 and 1963 . Folowing both changes , Puerto limn industry continued to loutish , while wages rose . The " percentage " formula lows from the fact that Puerto tie ? is part of the American ? conomy , selling its products ' reely in the American market without any tariffs and in com ) etition with producers paying he Federal minimum wage in he fifty states . As such , Puerto titan workers are entitled to hare in the greater affluence If the nation and , at the same time , continental employes and employers should enjoy some M.D. 's Traffic Woes To the Editor : I have just finished reading your Jan. 3 editorial entitled " The Big Crush . " In referring to the threat of " total paralysis " which might result from the transit strike and the inflow of cars , you state " such paralysis would block the movement of fire engines , ambulances , and police cars ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of food , fuel ' and other essentials would become impossible . " In this enumeration you have left out the movement of doctors to hospitals , offices and in his authoritative study " China 's Wartime Finance and Inflation 1937-1945 " concludes that : " The Chinese Government 's inability to deal with the inflation , coming along with the disruption and suffering from enemy invasion , had a major part In making China ripe for revolution . " Every effort must be made to choke inflation in its Vietnamese cradle if China 's experience is not to be repeated . L. K. LITTLE Inspector General of Chinese Customs ( ret . ) Plainfield , N. H. , Feb. 22 , 1966 ? President 's Ideals To the Editor : James Reston 's Feb. 25 column on the editorial page entitled " Johnson , Tragic Dreamer , " was well done . Only the final , most important point was missed . This was that the President , by yearning after great ideals and dreaming great dreams , reflects the hopes and hearts of the unfortunate . If his reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Society make firmer the earth on which these great social changes must eventually stand . This is the point on which Reston should have closed . WINFIELD S. MORGAN , M.D. Professor of Pathology Western Reserve University Cleveland , Feb. 25 , 1966 ? For Candor on Policy To the Editor : President Johnson is doing all of us a grave disservice by giving us the consensus treatment , not candor , on Vietnam . During the past week he has asked us to believe , in the face of reports of war-weariness , devastation and desertion , that there is ma new sense of purpose " in South Vietnam ; that we are fighting there not virtually alone , againstworld opinion , but with " vital ' support " from allies ; and tini , t recent criticisms of the fundamentals of his policy amount only to " minimal " differences . He offers these blandishments as he leads us into a deeper : , grimmer commitment to a war that may last seven years , and even then fail . He obscures our understanding precisely when we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when . the national interest requires debate and dissent . We want hard facts and realism ; we get soft soap and rhetoric . ALAN DORE Instructor of History Connecticut College New London , Conn . Feb. 28 , 1966 ? Attack on DuBois Club To the Editor : Is lynch law going to rule In New York as it does in the Deep South ? This disturbing question is posed by the story of the attack on the W. E. B. DuBois Club members in Brooklyn . This incident has all the features of a dispatch from Selma , Ala . An unpopular group meets inside a building while a hostile crowd grows outside . A couple of police are there , but they do , not bother to call for reinforcer ments until after the crowd attacks . The police are either unwilling or unable to protect the ' DuBois Club members , but when one , surrounded by a punching , " kicking crowd , pulled an ' air pistol to defend himself , he promptly arrested . Five other members of the ' . DuBois Club were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around to arresting any members of the mob . The concept of equal protection under the law dies a little ' more .
