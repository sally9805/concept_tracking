" Suppose Lyndon Johnson had just died , " the man from the Canadian Broadcasting Company said , and I found myself intrigued , perhaps even a little enchanted . " We 'd like some quotes about him for our back-up files . You know , to be used if-and-when . " We talked of taping schedules , of keeping in mind that my comments would be used only after the 36th President had departed us , and if my mention of a fee shocked the CBC man into thoughts of blood money he did not reveal it . We were cool and detached : two Old Pros getting ready to tape a commercial extolling some headache powder , or the latest tourist paradise . " Give it some thought , " CBC said and rang off . My original thought was that the subject did n't require much thought . I knew how I felt about LBJ as well as I knew the face in my bathroom mirror . I would simply grab the microphone and say . . . Well , say what ? That our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That people did n't trust him , that he was a bully and a manic-depressive and sometimes a liar ? That he had known much more ambition than history , that his subjects had grown so weary of their great , vain cowboy king ( and the pouchy little eyes above the pinched , pious judge 's mouth which could brutally excoriate a staff worker , humiliate a Congressman , curse up a storm ) that they might be tempted to buy that old , frazzled , retread of a flat tire named Nixon ? That though he had made much of looking after the commonweal he had looked after LBJ well enough to accumulate fifteen million dollars in the public service ? All true , give or take a certain harshness of judgment , but not the whole story . We could never leave LBJ with that epitaph alone . Not , probably , that there would be much flap about it if we did . For Lyndon Johnson was never very good at making us love him . He spoke sweet nothings in courtship of our votes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wanted to join with Goldwater ? ) , we were somehow fearful that he might cheat on us . We could cry if the old rogue died in office , some of us because we meant it and others because tradition demands tears for a dead President . But it would be a faceless , formless weeping : more of a duty than a tribute ; more an admission that Death ? that dark and dirty bastard with the ultimate Ace up his sleeve ? had triumphed again , rather than any expression of personal loss . And more than a few of us might not cry at all . That we could not easily weep for Lyndon Johnson is not all his fault . Perhaps , one November afternoon in the damnable year 1963 , we simply used up our generation 's Presidential tears . Or perhaps we can not forget , fairly or not , that our last Presidential mourning came out of Texas just as Lyndon Johnson did . Maybe we can not forgive his personal profit in a moment when most of us lost much : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our grip on sanity 's slippery edge . And that , too , is unfair . One recent night in New York an old friend and former political ally , now an executive in industry , sat talking with me of Johnson . Once my friend was the more " liberal " ; possibly our roles have switched . Indeed , he tends to see me as a bearded and impractical dreamer , a man to be kept away from children . There was music around us , and people danced , but the mood was leaden . The clean exhilaration of old battles we had fought together in Texas and Washington seemed all too distant and lost . " Be fair , " my friend said . " You gooney-bird writer types do n't give Johnson any credit . You knock his accent or Texas hat or blame him for old sins of history . " Well , yes . We do that , do n't we ? And this shows a lack of journalistic imagination , for no other President has given us so many legitimate opportunities to criticize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fetish about fair play for one not noted for his fairness to others . As Detroit 's ghetto burned our President went on national television more to pin blame on poor old Governor Romney than to inspire or offer solutions , ( Never saying , of course , that he had recently rejected a private proposal by New York 's Governor Nelson Rockefeller to call a national conference on ghetto problems . ) He cooed dove songs in 1964 and when our votes were safely counted adopted a Goldwaterish Vietnam posture . He once read aloud to newsmen from a confidential FBI report on a Bobby Baker case character who claimed that he had rebated a color television set as a condition for writing LBJ 's insurance . He justified sending U. S. Marines into the Dominican Republic ! All the way from Holland , a very cordial new cordial : Vandermint Minted Chocolate Liqueur . with a dramatic speech telling of " some fifteen hundred people murdered and shot and their heads cut off , " of bullets smashing into the American Embassy , of our Ambassador cringing under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson canceled or delayed appointments to federal offices after columnists had correctly predicted his choices . He misled the press in leaking inflated budgetary figures so as to later ? and falsely ? claim credit for magically reducing expenditures . He claimed victories in Vietnam where victories were not . And when gooney-bird writer types wrote of these and other perfidies , LBJ flew into snits of rage and snarled of persecution . One speaking of Lyndon Johnson and fair play in the same breath should speak softly and never in the presence of ladies . " Look at his record , " my old friend touted . " Rat money for the slums . ? . Medicare ? . . civil-rights bills . Johnson is better with Congress than Kennedy was . He 's passed more bills . And there 's never been a harder-working President . " Give him that . Give him credit , too , for the forceful way he accepted the Presidential mantle in a black and bloody time ; praise him for the confidence he restored as we lay stricken . So assume Lyndon B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only of eulogies and nominating speeches , assign him every good intention . Say he was truly dedicated to improving labor 's wage , the child 's education , the black man 's rights . Credit him with his best efforts to raise a truly Great Society out of the violent and splintered society that we have become . Grant , even , that all his half-loaf legislative compromises were justified on the Johnsonian theory that one should accept the possible when the ideal seems beyond reach ; accept a few of the legislative miracles claimed in his name . And admit that in many things Lyndon Johnson often seemed miles ahead of those tired old mossbacks and cautious young fogies in Congress . Parts of Lyndon Johnson 's record will do him honor beyond the tomb . Why , then , do we find it so difficult to give him a decent burial ? Why do we feel that our dead king was somehow fatally flawed ? " Style " has much to do with it . Style ( roughly meaning a manner of doing things , a pattern of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to the creation of certain graceful illusions . We are much preoccupied with style in the politics of the 1960s and our politicians , knowing this , practice unusual arts : Nixon hires a new makeup man because a bad facial job once cost him the Presidency ; Bobby Kennedy 's hair fashion goes with amplified guitars and psychedelic drums ; Congressmen hire gag writers to put Lincolnesque humor in their speeches . Even Dean Rusk , that staid and elderly son of Georgia , acknowledges the mood and the lingo of the times by adopting hippie language in attempting recovery of our captured spy ship " I would strongly advise North Korea to cool it . " There is a new mood in the air and our politicians sense it . They do not understand it yet , nor can they define it , but they know the old tunes wo n't do for dancing anymore . There is a certain classic photograph made by Richard Pipes on the 1960 campaign trail . Lyndon Johnson , Stetson planted squarely on his head , has one arm poking into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His mouth is open and rounded in some urgent bellow ; the eyes are squinted and appear somehow sightless . And there is young Jack Kennedy , hatless , leaning in to place a calming or restraining hand on the thick Johnson upper torso , the Kennedy face at once a little grim and thoughtful and slightly incredulous . One sees there the eldest son come to drag the old man home from the saloon before he makes a whiskey-tenor ass of himself or blows the family paycheck for grog or on sucker bets . Only one picture , yes ; only a split hair frozen in time ; unfair to read anything in , except what is there . Yet what is there is proof that Lyndon Johnson became obsolete at the height of his career : how absurd to have a hog-calling arm-waver in the Presidency when mankind 's teeth are on edge and four more of our 11-bombs are missing ! The face-andstyle under that Stetson is a relic from the rural 1930s . One would not send its owner into the urban ghetto to address any problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might expect cheers for half-forgotTHE EASY CHAIR ten old civil-rights bills , or issue an awkward invitation to come reason together over watermelon , or blurt out something about an imagined Negro " best friend " he had known in the Army . If provoked , the deliverer of such a face-and-style might lecture ghetto prisoners about the evils of Saturday night gin , about saving their money , or even about the need for more po-leece unless everybody simmers down . Face it : that style is pass ? . Young men look on it and shudder at what their fathers have willed them . They do not understand that such proud , howling old savages ( ignorant in the classic sense of having read few books and able to make the boast sound honest ) had their uses in the bleak America of the 1930s , nor that they knew many noble moments . Like the early-day pioneers they had that tough ability to provide life 's basics : food , shelter , protection for the tribe . They attended those matters most needing attention . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few civil rights had to be violated or a few knuckles busted to organize a union ( or prevent one ) they went ahead with their violating and busting . They could become bedfellows with Oil or Business , giving service and receiving it , telling themselves if they were progressives that they whored in the interest of the Common Man ( for who would save the Common Man unless a few of his number broke into the power structure ? ) and if they were conservatives they could claim to have shacked up in defense of the Constitution and the Republic . Such men beat the Great Depression and stopped Hitler . They invoked God 's name on their causes as if He might be a fraternity brother ; they cheered their country at war . Now they neither understand nor are they understood . Come , now , look at the photograph again : does that face-and-style under the Stetson bear any relation to these times ? Does it wonder why people laugh or curse when it tells us that it does not mind a little dissent in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confined to the home ? Does it have the faintest notion that its legislative record ? how THE EASY CHAIR ever impressive two or three years ago ? has faded to almost nothing when compared to today 's unattended crises of national morality , credibility , and intent ? " He can tell you , " Norman Mailer wrote of Lyndon Johnson four years ago , " that yesterday we knocked off ninety-four gooks . " One read that and said , " Come of it , Mailer . Endow the man with one human emotion . " We have killed 26,000 of ' em , " LBJ was later quoted during a stroll among the White House roses , and running across this casual mass obituary for thousands of nameless Asians , seeing it there in cold type , leaping out like some obscene comic-strip utterance by Daddy Warbucks , stated so matter-of-factly and nobody screaming-in parenthesis , one felt a hopeless unease . Worlting at the spear-carrier's. level in Congress when Lyndon Johnson put on the best show in town as Senate Majority Leader , I was always fascinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rough , profane , almost mystical , he shook and rattled Washington in a way that recalled the youthful enthusiasms of the New Deal . In those bland Eisenhower years he gave the illusion of changing a world ; in the first days of his Presidency he would do it again . Yet , it would be an illusion . He was not changing the world ; rather , the world around him was changing . Perhaps Hiroshima had changed it , or the Nuremberg trials , or those costly years of suspicion bred by the Cold War and McCarthyism . Other nations did not love us : we were mankind 's first nuclear killers , we occupied too much of the globe , there was too much of the whiskey-drinking Bible salesman in our pious pronouncements of a freedom that was accompanied by Jim Crowism , rotting slums , 17-2 missions hopelessly bun-gled and then lied about before the ? world . We became a tired and stagnant people even as our cities vibrated with commerce and while our politicians reassured us that we were the chosen . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eisenhower preserved us a nation , not attended it . Our children saw us and were ashamed . We needed something . Kennedy gave it to us . Call it a sense of Style . Suddenly America might be believed . again . It might grow young . Its liver spots might disappear . It might yet reach the moon and other higher destinies : young men and women of many races and classes joined hands in the bloodier thickets of the South and sang their hope- We Shall Ocercome . Our youth invaded distant lands not with flamethrowers and guns but as missionaries of the Peace Corps . Appalachia would come to life ; Martin Luther King would have his dream ; America was on the move again . How incredibly naive it all seems today , and how quickly it passed . We mourned and were restless and would grow in time to wonder whether Jack Ruby might not have known Lee Harvey Oswald better than the FBI or the Warren Commission told us . We would wonder , too . why those warmed-over New Deal measures Lyndon B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not eradicated poverty . made us love our neighbors , cured cancer , found God , or delivered us to Utopia . We would enjoy the first war brought into our home in Living Color , sponsored by oil companies and life-insurance tycoons . When we caught our President handling the truth loosely he would sulk in the White House or castigate the teller of truth . He would play Moses one day , George Washington the next , and then ' jolly ole Saint Nick . He would insult us by insisting that we accept each role in its turn . And when we called him at his game , he ( or his apologists ) would say it was n't fair to haunt him with Jack Kennedy 's ghost because Style did not matter : Style was not relevant to the interests of ; the Common Man . Style did not beautify highways nor kill Communists : . Style was merely Harvard vs . South- , . west Texas State Teachers at San Marcos . Can the apologists not understand that in a world searching for and needing greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad , to inspiring a nation or reassuring a world ? Do they not see that in a time when our cities burn , when our children " turn on , tune in , and drop out , " when our young men die unexplained , when we have lost faith in the old virtues and do not yet fully trust the new that only someone with a sense o Style can reach us ?
