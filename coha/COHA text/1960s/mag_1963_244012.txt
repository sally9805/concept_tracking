Three months ago , an Austrian youth hid his East Berlin fiancee in the small luggage space behind the seats of an Austin Healey Sprite . Then he ducked his head and gunned the midget sports car ( 35 in. high ) underneath the last Communist barrier at Checkpoint Charlie with two inches to spare . Few believed that it could be done again , since presumably the Reds would now be suspicious of sports cars . Nevertheless , last week another enamored suitor with the same strategy in mind rented the same Sprite from the same West Berlin agency . Then Norbert Konrad , 26 , an Argentine citizen of German origin , drove into East Berlin , cached his blonde sweetheart , Helga , in the car in the same way , and roared back to the West under the same peppermint-striped wooden crossbar . Belatedly , the Communists began fitting out the underside of the barrier with steel bars . <P> As the Berlin Wall approached its second anniversary , Communist police assigned to guard it were themselves defecting at the rate of one a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a tourist bus crossing from the West , stepped smilingly over the white dividing line . On the River Elbe a 50-year-old boatman packed his wife and three children into a stolen motor launch , put-putted to freedom . Two men rowed a kayak across the Baltic to Denmark . The 20-year-old stepdaughter of an East German army colonel slipped through barbed wire south of the Wall , reported that East German youth is now more interested in acquiring blue jeans than party medals . <P> As always , many an attempt ended in tragedy . Near the border resort of Hohegeiss , a crowd of Swedish and Danish tourists watched horrified as a man , wheezing with exhaustion , struggled to climb a pole over the barbed wire . Rushing up with guns blazing , Red border guards kept pumping bullets into him even after he dropped to the ground , left the body for two hours in the weeds . <P> If there is a thaw in the cold war , the fact is not evident along the Wall .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
