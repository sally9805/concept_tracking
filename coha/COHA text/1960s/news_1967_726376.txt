txt The Security Council 's unanimous call for a ceasefire should bring the fighting to a halt in the Middle East . It is not too soon to look beyond the approaching truce to the peacemaking that must follow . The Soviet backdown on the effort to add a troopwithdrawal clause to the cease-fire appeal in a form that would have indirectly endorsed Egypt 's blockade of the Gulf of Aqaba was recognition of the military facts of life . Israeli forces obviously are not going to halt , much less withdraw , unless assured that the gulf will remain open . And it must be clear now to Moscow , as to all the world , that peace and blockade are mutually exclusive . But effective assurance on Aqaba is unlikely to be enough this time to liquidate the crisis . Nor should the United Nations settle for that . What must be avoided , after the experiences of 1949 and 1956 , is another armistice that fails to end the war . No settlement , of course , can expunge a military humiliation that will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be made in restoring peace to establish completely new conditions for the future that achieve stability rather than a basis for revived tension . Indications that Israel may be willing to cooperate in this direction can be seen in Foreign Minister Abba Eban 's statement that " more stable relationships " in the Middle East will be one of his country 's peace aims and in Premier Eshkol 's far-reaching promise to seek no territorial advantages from victory . Many disparate issues undoubtedly will be raised in the negotiations that lie ahead .

Israel , in turn ; will certainly seek assurances from the U.A.R. and the international community before withdrawing from Sinai and the Gaza Strip .

A. stable settlement is conceivable only if the United States and the Soviet Union work together for one . It was the agreement between Ambassadors Goldberg and Fedorenko yesterday that made the cease-fire appeal possible . The question now is whether Moscow , which initially concentrated on strengthening its position in the Arab world and weakening that of the United States , will now turn to a Middle Eastern equivalent of the Tashkent spirit . It should be clear that the arms race in the Middle East , ? fed by Soviet military shipments , can endanger not only that region but the peace of the world .
