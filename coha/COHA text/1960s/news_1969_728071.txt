txt The Navy is worried that the fleet may have to sail in the post-Vietnam era with fewer aircraft carriers , which are the symbol and substance of American supremacy on the oceans . Not since 1949 , when the Truman Administration canceled construction of the first modern supercarrier and the admirals revolted , has the Navy been so concerned . An amendment that went to the Senate floor today would , by deleting $377-million from the military authorization bill for the fiscal year 1970 , delay for at least a year the construction of a third nuclear carrier , to be called the Eisenhower which is now scheduled for commissioning in 1974 . Congress appropriated $133-million for the 74,000-ton warship in previous budgets and it will cost between $510-million and $600-million to build . Impact of Korean War Although the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950 forced the number of attack carriers in the fleet back up from the doldrums of seven in 1949 to an average of 15 in the years since , the Navy now faces the distinct possibility that it will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the years immediately ahead . The antimilitary atmosphere generated in Congress by the Vietnam war and domestic needs created by the crisis of the cities have once more brought the forces of economy to bear . The amendment , besides putting off further construction on the third nuclear carrier until next year , would direct the // Government Accounting Office , the Congressional fiscal watchdog agency , to assemble for Congress in the meantime whatever studies are available within the executive branch on the general concept of the carrier . The questions on which thell amendment seeks information ! range over such aspects as the carrier 's costs and advantages ' as compared to land-based avia- ' tion , its role and vulnerability in both conventional and nuclear war and the number of carriers required to meet likely military contingencies . The amendment is given little chance of passage , hut the admirals realize that while the skirmish may he won , the fight will still be on . The amendment 's obvious purpose is to provoke debate . and the argument will not die with the vote . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carrier and to keep at least 15 in the fleet after the Vietnam war . A 16th attack carrier temporarily in service since 1965 , the World War II vintage Shangri-La , will return to the antisubmarine warfare forces once the conflict ends . Appeals and Briefings The Navy effort has included appeals to such Congressional allies as Senator John C. Stennis of Mississippi . chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , and briefings for , journalists by senior officers 1 1 One of the principal arguments of the carriers ' critics is that a force of 15 is too many and is an arbitrary number that originates from the Naval Arms Limitation Treaty of 1921 between Japan , Britain and the United States . The treaty permitted the Navy 15 capital ships , at that time battleships . The Navy 's answer is that the.number 15 was not arrived al arbitrarily and evolved from ; the military consequences of United States foreign policy commitments  --  the necessity to keep two attack carriers on constant station in the Mediterranean and three and occasionally more in the Pacific . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two carriers in service for every one on active deployment if it is to have a force that is combat ready , with the ships and planes mechanically sound and the officers and men well-trained and in a good state of : morale by virtue of not be- , ing kept at sea for overly long ; periods . Emergency Moves A typical alignment for the 16 carriers now in the fleet is to have five on station in the ! Mediterranean and the Pacific , two in transit , five training in Pacific or Atlantic home waters , one undergoing shortterm repairs , one in drydock for a major five-year overhaul , and two in port for shore leave for the crews . In an emergency the two carriers in transit can he diverted immediately to the crisis point , as occurred after the North Korean seizure of the , intelligence ship Pueblo , and in ; a major national crisis 12 car-1 riers can move immediately , ; two more in a week , another a week later and the 16th from dry-dock within 60 to 90 days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer than 15 in the fleet , officers say , but at the cost of a significantly lower state of training and repair and with poor crew morale , which would bring more resignations from the service and higher costs to enlist and train new men . The ships themselves , which now have a lifetime of 25 to 30 years , would also wear out cnrisiderably faster , the Navy says . Even with a force of 15 rt is necessary to lay the keel of a new carrier every other year . The Eisenhower , for example , is scheduled in 1974 to replace the Bonhomme Richard built in 1944 . The Navy said it has examined one major proposal of its critics  --  that alternate crews be formed to keep a single carrier on station for twice the current average time and thus possibly cut the over-all force of 15 carriers by approximately half  --  and has rejected the idea as too costly . Some officers say that a variation of this proposal is practical for the pilots and maintenance crews of the aircraft alone , however . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam in 1965 , the Navy had reluctantly accepted a plan approved by former Secretary of Defense Robert S. to revert eventually , shortly after 1970 , to 15 carriers but only 12 active air wings . The Nixon Administration could come up with a similar plan from another longrange study the Defense Department is now conducting of the carrier . Even if United States foreign policy commitments are reduced , particularly in Asia , 15 carriers should still be kept in the fleet , the Navy argues . Military and Political The admirals ' argument here Is both military and political , and the political reasoning is similar to the contention of ; uch critics of foreign policy is Senator J. W. Fulbright of Arkansas , chairman of the senate Foreign Relations Committee , who has repeatedly warned that American bases abroad can carry commitments : o future military involvement : hat will prove far more costly : ban the dollar price of the ) ases alone . In a memorandum to Secre:ary of the Navy John H. Chafee : his Aug. 25 , defending the : oncept of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief ) f Naval Operations , said that : he purely military requirement ' or carrier-based aircraft was ; rowing because the number of ) perational overseas American and air bases has declined from 105 in 1957 to a current 35 . He said the future held out i further decline in land bases ) ecause " regardless of pacts or ) ase agreements , one nation : an , as has been demonstrated - epeatedly in recent years , uniaterally cancel a treaty and ) ur bases in that nation are ost to us . " " Retaining existing U. S. land bases on foreign soil or adding new ones can involve additional U. S. political and military commitments in exchange for base rights . " Admiral Moorer ! ontinued . " These commitments nay he far more onerous than Lollar costs . Additionally , the resence of bases on foreign ; nil has been a source of ' Yankee go home ' sentiment Ind charges of U.S. intervention and neo-colonialism . ' The Navy is quick to add la carriers , unlike land bases , can move over three-fourth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day without : reaty commitments or diplomatic negotiations with any foreign government . They can provide a show of force when necessary to back up the diplomat 's word . Their planes , and the bombs , can reach out to 85 per cent of the area covered by American military contingency plans and 95 per cent of the world 's population . Critics of the carrier argue , however , that the mere existence of a large force of 15 such ships and their planes creates i temptation to extend foreign policy commitments and to intervene in the affairs of other nations . Naval officers counter that the direction of foreign policy is the responsibility of the political authorities and that the carrier is a tool that can serve policies of either greater or lesser intervention equally well . In his memorandum to the Secretary , Admiral Moorer also contended that even in purely monetary terms the cost of operating a naval air wing of 00 planes from a carrier " was about the same " as running a comparable Air Force tactical wing from a land base because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He provided no figures , however , and critics of carrier aviation dispute this favorable cost comparison . Finally , naval officers argue that the alleged vulnerability of the carrier to missiles and torpedoes launched by enemy submarines , surface ships and airplanes has been greatly exaggerated by the carrier 's opponents , particularly insofar as conventional warfare is concerned . Officers say that to be effective in conventional warfare . enemy missiles must score a direct hit on the carrier , and that this can he made exceedingly difficult . Even if a direct hit is made , carriers , particularly the modern 60,000 to 74,000 - ton classes , are extremely tough ships , armored and compartmentalized to absorb battle damage . In a nuclear conflict , officers acknowledge , the carriers obviously only could last for a time , but , one officer said , " nothing will survive in a nuclenr war over the long run . " And if a nuclear war occurs , the carriers will have fulfilled their use fulness when their planes have been launched , one admiral noted . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " who will give a damn about the carriers in the Medi ; terranean ? " at such Navy-oriented organizations as the Georgetown University Center for Strategic and International Studies . For the Navy , and particu- t larly the aviators who havel dominated since the Japanese i sank the battleship admirals , along with their ships at Pearl ( Harbor , the carrier question is t an emotional issue where much I more is involved than mere numbers . Polaris submarines are an I awesome nuclear deterrent . t ' -. , - destroyers and cruisers are potent surface combat-mts rod i ! the amphibious forces are a I powerful offensive arm . but the i carriers are the soul of the !
