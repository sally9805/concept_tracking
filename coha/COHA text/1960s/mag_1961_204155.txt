As Nikita Khrushchev headed for Vienna , TIME 'S Moscow Bureau Chief Ed Stevens reported that the Kremlin , where changes in the Soviet top command often happen imperceptibly , now had a new heir apparent . His name : Dmitry Polyansky , 43 , a man the world has scarcely heard of . <P> The man generally ticketed as the anointed heir has long been ponderous Party Secretary Frol Kozlov , 52 . Khrushchev himself told Averell Harriman in June 1959 that he had picked Kozlov as his successor . As recently as last April , Kozlov stood beside Khrushchev at the triumphant reception for Spaceman Gagarin . Since then , Kozlov has dropped out of sight . Last week diplomats heard that he had suffered a heart attack ( Kozlov is known to have high blood pressure ) . Other reports were that Kozlov had merely incurred Khrushchev 's displeasure on matters of policy . Whatever the reason , Kozlov is now considered permanently shelved . <P> On Moscow 's in-the-know circuit , other somewhat obvious candidates are brusquely dismissed . First Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and purges , is an Armenian . Tousle-haired Party Secretary Mikhail Suslov , 58 , the " hard line " party theoretician , is rated too theoretical ; First Deputy Premier Aleksei Kosygin , 58 , a veteran economic planner , is thought to lack the stomach for the job . Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev was earlier kicked upstairs . <P> More than any other man in the Presidium , Polyansky typifies the new generation of technocratic leaders who are empirical in their outlook and have little time for dogma . The party biography supplies him with the best of credentials . He was born in a poor peasant 's hut in the Ukraine on Nov. 7 , 1917-the day the Bolsheviks took power . Polyansky missed the confusions and disorders of the civil war and forced collectivization , graduated from the Kharkov Agricultural Institute , then rose steadily through the party 's administrative ranks . He is a brash and bouncing extravert . At Kremlin functions , Polyansky does not stand around stiffly with the other Presidium members making small talk with diplomats ; he table-hops around the hall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisecracks . <P> First sign that Kozlov was slipping in Khrushchev 's favor came in early 1958 , when Polyansky replaced him as premier of the Russian Soviet Republic , which includes both Moscow and Leningrad and is the biggest and richest of all Soviet republics . Thereafter , it became slowly apparent that Khrushchev was transferring his affections from the flannel-mouthed Kozlov to the nimble young newcomer . In last winter 's Party Plenum debate on the agricultural crisis , Polyansky 's role was second only to Khrushchev 's . When Khrushchev followed up the debate with a two-month , cross-country talkathon to exhort Russia 's peasants to greater effort , it was Polyansky he took along to back him up . <P> Americans had a look at Polyansky when he visited the U.S. in early 1960 as head of the delegation of Soviet republic premiers . His booming voice and bouncing gait distracted attention from the careful cliches of his speeches . But speeches are not what count in Kremlin politics .                  @ @ @
