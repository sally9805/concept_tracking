Cover Story <P> Nowhere does the plant , man , grow more vigorously than in Italy . <P> - Stendhal , 1826 <P> IN the land of Michelangelo , Garibaldi and the Medicis there reigns a vast and unusual variety of contemporary heroes . The Italians idolize Grand Prix drivers , artists , novelists and occasionally Sicilian banditti . They fall barely short of adoring Nino Benvenuti , the boxing champion . They lavish attention on their celebrated movie directors-Antonioni , Fellini , Rossellini . And who , of course , could overlook Gina or Sophia ? <P> To this colorful collection the Italians have lately added a less likely hero : the industrialist . He has earned national popularity because he and his kind are transforming Italy . The industrialists have produced an economic expansion that Italians call Il Miracolo or , simply , Il Boom , which has laced the countryside with crowded autostrade and studded the cities and villages with TV antennas . More fundamentally , Il Boom is converting Italy from a peasant society that served an elite into a consumer society that caters to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The most widely admired and envied Italian industrialist-the Numero Uno-is Giovanni Agnelli , the head of automaking Fiat . Turin-based Fiat , which has produced four out of every five cars on Italy 's roads , has done more than any other Italian firm to shape the country 's new affluence at home and influence abroad . " Agnelli has a mythology not unlike President Kennedy 's , " writes British Journalist Anthony Sampson in The New Europeans . " Clearly his presence fills some kind of psychological gap . " <P> A City-State <P> At 47 , " Gianni " Agnelli ( pronounced Johnny An-yell-ie ) lives in the style of an ancient Florentine prince . He is probably Italy 's richest man and heaviest taxpayer-and he is , as well , an articulate social critic with a healthy appetite for life . His wife , a Neapolitan princess , is a renowned beauty and an energetic volunteer social worker as well as a society leader .

Most of its 157,000 employees work in 22 plants around smog-covered Turin . Their paychecks , which average $1.28 an hour for a 45-hour week , directly support 40% of the city 's 1,300,000 population . Fiat has company housing , company resorts and entertainment , company clinics and sports teams-but few company strikes . There have been work stoppages on only 34 days in the past six years . Fiat also controls Turin 's La Stampa ( circ. 500,000 ) , which is probably Italy 's best daily after the Corriere della Sera . It far outsells the Communist daily L'Unita among Turin 's workers . Like Agnelli , the paper is undogmatic , progressive and slightly left-of-center on most issues . <P> The giant that Gianni Agnelli operates last year had alltime-high sales of $2.1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turbines , jet fighter planes , trucks , diesel engines and farm
