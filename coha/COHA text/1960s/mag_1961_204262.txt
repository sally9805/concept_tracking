Is the universe exploding-expanding swiftly into the uttermost reaches of space ? Scientists have been puzzling over the startling speculation ever since the 1920s , when Mount Wilson Astronomers Edwin Hubble and Milton Humason discovered that the glow from distant galaxies was of a longer wave length than normal . Since light from a receding source shifts toward the red ( long wave length ) end of the spectrum , the Hubble-Humason observations seemed to suggest that far-out galaxies are all speeding away from the earth and from each other . <P> Though many a cosmologist was bothered by the bizarre idea of a swiftly expanding universe , no one yet has been able to prove it wrong . But last week in the British journal Nature , Physicist Alastair Ward of Glasgow 's Royal College of Science and Technology suggested a possible way to squelch the big explosion and bring the universe back into a steady state of vast but stable dimensions . Colliding light beams may lose some of their energy , says Ward , as photons ( particles of light ) carom off other photons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave length , and in light-drenched space such energy-diminishing collisions are highly probable . They could explain the Hubble-Humason red shift . <P> Other physicists have toyed with the same notion , but Ward describes an actual experiment to test this theory . The Mssbauer Effect , discovery of which won German Physicist Rudolph Mssbauer a Nobel Prize ( TIME , Nov. 10 ) , allows gamma rays from certain radioactive isotopes to be used for measurements of extreme precision . Since gamma rays are closely akin to light , Physicist Ward suggests shooting them across an intense light beam and measuring any loss of energy due to photon-photon collisions . <P> Such an experiment will be both expensive and difficult , and if it succeeds in bringing the theoretically expanding universe to a theoretical halt , it will raise an additional problem of its own : what happens to the energy lost in photon-photon collisions ? Dr. Ward does not favor the suggestion that the lost energy turns into the radio waves that permeate space . He prefers the more startling notion that the energy is transformed , in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eternal source of nuclear fuel for the hydrogen-burning stars .
