Officials of the Chicago transit authority said the city 's public transportation system faced a " public crisis , " and hinted that fare increases or a new form of government subsidy might be necessary . 3 . A city council committee unanimously approved a proposed 12 per cent increase in Chicago taxi fares . The proposal was sent to the city council , where it might be acted upon as soon as next Tuesday . Schools BY PETER NEGRONIDA The Chicago Teachers union asked the board of education yesterday for a 10 per cent across-the-board salary increase for 1970 . A spokesman for the board called the demand " out of the question . " John E. Desmond , union president , disclosed the salary proposal to reporters before a two-hour session with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other Demands Told Other new demands listed by Desmond were : 1 . A one-week cut in the length of the school year to give city students a chance to compete for summer jobs with suburban students whose school year ends earlier . 2 . A change in the salary schedule to allow teachers to reach the maximum pay after 15 years instead of the current 36 years . 3 . At least 600 additional teachers to lower class size . In addition , the union is insisting on full implementation of the 1969 and previous contracts , including restoration of the teachers ' second week of paid vacation , 500 teaching positions , and 1,800 teacher aids after July 1 . They Were Cut Those three items , which would cost 20.8 million dollars , were cut by Supt. James F. Redmond to balance the 558.9-million-dollar budget for 197 " t Desmond said his demand for 10 per cent raises was " minimal , " and that the union " should be asking for 25 per cent increases to cover higher living costs . " He also asserted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial raises in 1970 . " This kind of an increase is totally out of the question , as far as I 'm concerned , " Mrs. W. Lydon Wild , head of the board negotiating committee , said after the session . " All you have to do is look at our budget and you 'll see how out of the question it is . " Figures Are Told A 10-per-cent hike would raise a beginning teacher 's basic pay from $8,000 to $8,800 a year , but from $8,400 to $9,240 if a two-week paid vacation is included . Maximum base pay would rise from $14,050 to $15 , - 455 a year , but from $14,752.50 to $16,227.75 including vacation pay . The cost of such an increase , if given to the board 's civil service employes and administrators , would come to about 40 million dollars for all of 1970 . The 600 additional teachers the union wants would cost another 5 or 6 million , and the cost of shortening the salary schedule can not be calculated . Desmond and Mrs. Wild said they hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so a contract can be signed befor the board adopts its 1970 budget in mid-January . Contract negotiations will resume at 9:30 a. m . Monday with a group of Redmond aids meeting with the union to clear away preliminaries . Mrs. Wild 's three-member board committee will be brought in only for the hard bargaining expected later .
