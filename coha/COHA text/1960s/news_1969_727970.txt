txt The Most Rev. Matthias Defreggcr , an Auxiliary Roman Catholic Bishop of Munich , who passed on a wartime order that resulted in the killing of 17 unarmed Italians , appealed to the people of their village today for " understanding and forgiveness . " " I tried to save what could be saved , " he said . " It was not possible for me totally to prevent the terrible deaths . " The Bishop , still in seclusion in an undisclosed place , made his first public comment on the , affair in Filetto di Camarda in June , 1944 , in an open letter ' , to priests and communicants of ' his diocese . The letter was ' made public by his Munich ' office . Noting that an investigation by the Frankfurt prosecutor last year found the wartime killings not subject to legal action , Monsignor Defregger declared , " I also do not want to defend myself . " He said , " I can only turn myself over to God 's judgment " and called on his fellow Catholics to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to stand by my side . " The 54-year-old prelate , who was ordained in 1949 , was officially identified last week as the captain in a German antipartisan army unit who delegated to a lieutenant an order for the killing of male villagers in Filetto on June 7 , 1944 . The slayings were in retaliation for the slaying by Italian partisans of one or more Germans . Last Tuesday , Julius Cardinal Ddpfner of Munich defended his bishop , saying that Captain Defregger had tried " immediately " to get the order revoked and " did everything in his power to lighten the people 's terrible fate . " In his letter , Bishop Defregger sought to explain why his role in the killings had not come to light for 25 years , although Cardinal Dopfner said he had known about it before he elevated Father Defregger from vicar general to bishop last Sept. 14 . Has Kept Mostly Silent " Except for a very few people , I have kept silent about this burden until now , " Monsignor Defregger wrote . " I believe that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which I was caught would not have helped anybody . " Now I feel called upon to ask the inhabitants of Filetto for their understanding and forgiveness that I was of so little help . " " You should now know , " he wrote at another point , " that what the whole world now knows , was a heavy inner burden . Apart from the findings on the legalities of war , it always comes back to the ques-tion ? " After my unsuccessful resistance , could I not have refused the carrying out of shootings order to my last breath and without heed to the most extreme personal consequences ? " He answered by saying that he had tried to save what he could since the complete cancellation of the order was beyond possibility . In his statement last week , Cardinal ** said that Captain Defregger " did everything that stood in his power to lighten the people 's terrible fate . " " Thus he let the women and children be removed to spare United Press International Bishop Matthias Defregger them the terrible sight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Defregger had succeeded in reducing the order for the execution of all males to the killing of some males 16 to 60 years of age . The ages of 17 dead  --  three of the 20 victims survived  --  ranged from 17 to 65 . Cardinal DOpfner 's office said another statement would be issued tomorrow . Informed sources said it would probably seek to explain why Father Defregger had been elevated to bishop if the Cardinal knew of his past . Last week , the respected Munich newspaper , Sud - deutsche Zeitung , sent an editor , Hannes Burger , to Filetto to try to get an account of June 7 , 1944 . None of the residents with whom he spoke could identify a photograph of the Bishop but some recalled a German officer they called colonel who keep dispatching a courier back to the commander , apparently in an effort to stay the execution order . Mr. Burger reported that the villagers had no wish to see any German officer again , even for a reparations visit . Nor , he reported , did the villagers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extradition of Bishop Defregger or any other officers for trial in Italy . The villagers hoped that West Germany would prosecute any guilty parties , Mr. Burger said . When the editor asked what a suitable reparations symbol might be , the women said they wanted a monument , but the men favored a factory for the poor mountain village .
