Lili Kraus , a 58-year-old grandmother , has a crush on Wolfgang and she does n't care who knows it . When she jetted to Manhattan from Vienna last month , riding alongside her was the nearly life-size bust of Mozart that accompanies her wherever she goes . She came to do him honor in the best way she knows how : by playing all 25 of his piano concertos in nine consecutive concerts , the first time such a feat has been undertaken in the U.S. <P> <P> Behind her were two years of preparation-eight hours a day devoted to her maxim that " a work of art must be broken into a thousand pieces if it is to survive in the eternal . " She bought a piano that had been built in Mozart 's time , played it repeatedly to test its limitations , concluded that because of its fragile construction the composer expected his music to be played with a softer touch than is customary among modern pianists . Says she : " I eat , I talk , I clean my teeth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the music going on . This concert series is a life-consuming event , but also a life-crowning one . " <P> Treasure Fund . Draped regally in a gold brocade gown , her hair piled high in a bun , Lili Kraus last week began the first lap of her Mozart marathon . In the opening Concerto No. 4 , composed when Mozart was eleven , she unfolded the beguilingly simple melodies with a rippling grace and ease ; in No. 9 she engaged the Mozart Chamber Orchestra in a lighthearted dialogue that rang with all the gusto of a back-porch gossip fest . And her reading of the passionate No. 20 , the most popular of Mozart 's piano works , was clean refinement and intense drama . It was impeccable Mozart throughout , original without being eccentric , introspective without being pedantic . At concert 's end , the sellout crowd in Manhattan 's Town Hall applauded like baseball fans who had just shared in winning the first game of the World Series . <P> <P> Though she has played infrequently in the U.S. , Lili Kraus has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . Daughter of an impoverished scissor sharpener , she was born in Budapest , became a prodigy at six , taught adult students at eight , became a full-fledged soloist at 20 . In 1940 , while on a concert tour of Java , she was stranded by the war and eventually placed in a Japanese forced-labor camp . Denied access to a piano for most of the three years of her imprisonment , she " continued to play organically , " deciding that " either I go to the dogs or I make the experience the treasure fund of my life by falling back wholly on that which is within myself .
