txt California Republicans ca n't tell if they have taken a new , firm , final turn up a conservative street or simply hit a hard bump in the middle of the road . Whatever it is could shake national politics and hint the direction the presidential election will go this November . On primary day , June 4 , California Superintendent of Public Instruction Max Rafferty , a tough talking conservative , upset veteran incumbent // *Californians ponder whether primary vote hints trend // U.S. Sen. Thomas H. Kuchel , a self-talking moderate . It was a stunning upset  --  a fluke . Or was it ? It was an anti-Kuchel , antiestablishment vote . Or was it ? It was another straw in a conservative wind sweeping not only the state , but the nation . Or was it ? One thoughtful Republican analyst here says , " A sharp turn to the right ? You ca n't determine that today . You ca n't say for sure until we find out how California votes in November for president . " Two indications He thinks the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 2 million cast , showed two things : the strong anti-Kuchel storm that has been mounting to a hurricane since 1966 ; and the seething antiestablishment sentiment boiling up all over in this troubled political year . Others think it was all that , plus a strong strain of conservatism that has been building steadily for nearly a decade . One Republican here traces this creeping conservatism this way : " In 1960 Vice-President Richard M. Nixon beat John F. Kennedy for president in California  --  barely . The write-in votes finally decided it . " Then in 1962 , conservative Assemblyman Joe Shell , running in the GOP guber- A conservative tide ? GOP moderates could find the surfing rough natorial primary against Mr. Nixon , got 33 percent of the vote . " Two years later Barry Goldwater , a conservative , edged New York Gov . Nelson A. Rockefeller , a liberal , in the Republican presidential primary  --  with barely 50 percent of the vote .. " In 1966 , in the GOP primary for governor , Ronald Reagan , a conservative , ran against George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he swamped liberal Democratic Gov . Edmund G. Brown by 1 million votes . " Finally , in 1968 , you have Rafferty beating Kuchel . " Conservative tide ? In this chronology he reads a steadily mounting conservative tide . Robert McGee , the personable , swift-talking mastermind of the Rafferty triumph , also thinks a conservative tide is running . He says that in 1962 and 1964 , Behavior Science Corporation , ' a , California political research firm , showed that about 35 percent of all Republicans said they were conservatives . But in 1968 , research showed 60 percent admitting they were conservative . " The mood has been going that way for a long time , " says Mr. McGee . " It all polarized this spring in this election . " Tracing the contours of the phenomenon , whatever it is , politicos here find several upjutting promontories . One strategist close to the Kuchel campaign says : Mood expressed " Law and order , civil disorder , crime ? they form the issue . It 's basically a Republican issue and a conservative issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now . And Max was strong on the issue . " The antiestablishment wave is tied to this central issue . Mr. McGhee describes it as " a rejection of anything coming out of Washington . It is antiriot and anticriminal . It is anti-Supreme Court , whose decisions seem to favor criminals over victims . And it is antiincumbent . " In 1964 all this was real , but you could n't sell it then . In 1966 there was more disorder . And the issue really came crushing home in 1968 . " Anybody favoring things that run counter to this ' anti ' feeling is in real trouble this year . Rafferty was right on the issues . He was expressing the mood of the country . " However , Senator Kuchel to a large degree knitted the fabric of his own downfall . In 1964 , in his unbending moderation , he refused to endorse the party 's presidential candidate ? Barry Goldwater . That same year he also bridled at backing George Murphy for the Senate . Both were too conservative for Senator Kuchel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind Ronald Reagan for governor , that was too much for most Republicans . Mr. Rafferty garnered thousands of Republican votes by saying simply that " he is n't one of us "  --  and saying it over and over again . Runoff seen as test The runoff now between Mr. Rafferty and Democratic liberal , Alan Cranston , looms theoretically as a pure test of the conservative tide theory . Or does it ? Certainly it pits a clear-cut conservative against a clear-cut liberal . But other distracting factors will come into play . Mr. Rafferty is a colorful , hard-hitting , mellow-voiced campaigner . He has never lost an election . Mr. Cranston , though thoroughly capable , is a relatively color ? less , stiff campaigner . And in 1964 he lost a primary for the Senate against Pierre Sallinger , who then lost to Mr. Murphy . Wooing held necessary It wo n't be easy . It will take a strong antiestablishment , conservative tide and a lot of direct wooing of stunned Kuchelitesmore wooing than Mr. Rafferty has shown any sign of doing so far . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good test of just how the California voter  --  and perhaps the American voter ? is tending . It may show if the blue-collar vote Democrats could always count on in the past is now so middle-class oriented that it has really defected to the Republicans . There were signs it was beginning to when Mr. Reagan beat Governor Brown here in 1966 . If Mr. Rafferty now beats Mr. Cranston , despite the arithmetic , it could well prove that it is , indeed , a fact .
