Every day , somewhere in New York City 's public-school system , at least one teacher is shoved or struck by recalcitrant students ; uncounted others are cursed and threatened with beatings . Last week , in the wake of 13 such student assaults in the past six months , teachers at Bronx Junior High School 98 , where 96% of the students are either Negro or Puerto Rican , finally got fed up . Among other things , they asked Principal James Mandel and the school board to provide more protection than the single patrolman already on full-time duty there , give them the right to kick abusive students out of class . When school-board officials failed to meet the demands , 79 teachers-about 30 of them women-protested by turning in their resignations . After a three-day walkout , they were persuaded to return . <P> The mass resignation was just the latest painful symptom of the sickness that prevails in the nation 's largest and least efficient public-school system . To service a student population of more than 1,000,000 , and pay a teacher staff of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion-more than is spent by 26 states to operate their entire governments . The budget breaks down to an expenditure of about $1,000 a year per student , roughly $400 above the national average ; teacher salaries are among the highest of large U.S. cities . Yet the results are academically deplorable : recent surveys showed that New York students ranked well below national norms in such basic skills as reading and arithmetic . <P> Trapped . Appalled by the inadequacies of the system , middle-class white parents are increasingly steering their children into private and parochial schools or moving out to the suburbs . <P> <P> Last week a new census disclosed that a majority of New York 's students are now Negroes ( 29.3% ) or Puerto Ricans ( 20.9% ) -a situation common to many other major cities. - As it happens , the Negroes and Puerto Ricans , who see education as a way for their children to escape the ghetto , are no happier about the schools than the whites . " They put all their faith in the schools , " says a consultant to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools are doing a lousy job on their kids and feel trapped . " It is also true , of course , that many ghetto parents expect the schools to perform miracles in overcoming their own neglect of family obligations . <P> Nonetheless , the parents have cause for complaint . P.S. 80 , for example , is an obsolescent fortress , erected in 1924 , that serves Manhattan 's East Harlem district . Nearly all of the 886 students in the primary grades are Negro or Puerto Rican . An alarming 82% of its second-graders , 90% of its fourth-graders and 94% of its fifth-graders read below national norms . Every year , more than half of the students shift to another school as their parents change tenements . Of those who remain at P.S. 80 , half will drop out of high school . <P> " Educational Genocide . " Last December , parents became so angry over the inadequacies of P.S. 80 and other ghetto schools that they formed a self-styled " People 's Board of Education , " held a rally to berate the appointed school board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the schools be turned over to local control .
