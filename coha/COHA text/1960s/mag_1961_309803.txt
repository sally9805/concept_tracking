THE PRESIDENCY <P> ( See Cover ) The black , Russian-built Chaika , right on time , drove past the barbed-wire fence up to the door of the massive stone and stucco building that serves as the U.S. <P> embassy residence in Vienna . Out of the residence door , like a broncobuster sprung from his chute , bounded John Fitzgerald Kennedy . He dashed down the steps to meet his bald , fat guest . " How are you ? " he asked smilingly . " I 'm glad to see you . " Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev grinned politely and shook Kennedy 's hand . Thus , one cold , wet day last week , the youthful leader of the Western alliance greeted the tough leader of world Communism . <P> As Wilson and Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower had gone to Europe before him , President Kennedy went to Paris and Vienna with the express diplomatic purpose of winning friends and influencing enemies . In his luck-starred political career , John Kennedy had often handled that sort of challenge with smooth , winning assurance-but never before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles de Gaulle , or such an unpredict able enemy as the Soviet Union 's Khrushchev . As he carefully told the country beforehand , Kennedy 's European rendezvous with history were not intended for strategic decision or diplomatic agreement . Instead , his mission was to take personal measure of the man De Gaulle and the man Khrushchev-and to let them take their measure of the young Bostonian who directs the most powerful nation on earth . <P> Advance Billing . No momentous decisions were expected , and if any were made , they were not immediately an nounced . But the job of measuring was thoroughly done . Kennedy found De Gaulle to be in accordance with the advance billing : a messianic , convinced statesman who , in six frank and open talks , came not an inch closer to accepting the U.S. view that France should cut short its do-it-yourself nuclear-arms development and live up to its NATO commitments . De Gaulle found Kennedy to be clever and knowledgeable , but still unsure in the manipulation of national power . But the personal relationship went better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help of Jackie Kennedy at her prettiest , Kennedy charmed the old soldier into unprecedented , flattering toasts and warm gestures of friendship . The young aristocrat of Massachusetts and the old aristocrat of Colombeyles-Deux-Eglises achieved a rapport that would help when France and the U.S. try to resolve the issues that divide them . <P> But measuring an enemy was not the same as measuring a friend . Kennedy found Nikita Khrushchev in good humor-at least on the surface . Khrush was ready to trade quips and toasts-but not a bit interested in making concessions on issues . If Khrush has a telling weakness , Kennedy seemed not to have found it . <P> In spending long hours in private consultation with Nikita Khrushchev , as with Charles de Gaulle , Kennedy was engaged in personal diplomacy to an extent never before attempted by a U.S. President . There were potential benefits-and obvious hazards . Both Khrushchev and De Gaulle have greater power than Kennedy to translate their personal impressions into political action within their countries . And if , in their taking of his measure , either found him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dire .
