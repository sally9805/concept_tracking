txt The New York State Legislature wound up the third longest session in its history early yesterday morning so pleased with itself that it voted its members $5,000 pay increases for next year and tripled their unitemized expense allowances for the session . At the same time , by adopting a supplemental budget of $286 million , it pushed total state spending well above the $4-billion mark and made an increase in taxes or excessive borrowing next year almost inevitable . But that will be after the November election . While we do not think the pay increase as such was excessive , it is nevertheless outrageous that the lawmakers were able to find time to deal so handsomely with themselves on the closing day but not with a really urgent legislative matter , revision of the Condon-Wadlin Act . Since long before the transit strike last January so dramatically pointed up the futility of the existing law governing strikes by public employes , the need for replacing it with a workable substitute has been apparent . The Senate passed a realistic measure with powers of enforcement ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was afraid to go along . If as a result New York City is paralyzed by a long series of stoppages by organized city employes this fall , Governor Rockefeller will have no recourse but to call the Legislature back in special session to do then what it should have done long ago . The Legislature also failed to act on closing day on another important measure : a bill that would have created 35 more Supreme Court Justices-24 in New York City , nine in the suburbs , and two in northern New York . This enlargement has been repeatedly asked by the Judicial Conference as necessary to end calendar congestion . Here , however , the failure to act was not so much the time element as inability of Democrats and Republicans to agree on division of the spoils . Next year 's constitutional convention should thoroughly overhaul the whole method of selecting judges in this state . * * * * In fairness it must be acknowledged that the 1966 Legislature has to its credit one outstanding accomplishment and a number of other worthwhile achievements . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment than the cruel and archaic statute enacted in 1787 was an especially enlightened and courageous act . After much haggling , the Legislature also approved a New York City tax program that is sound in principle but inadequate in yield . It finally succeeded in setting up an essentially sound system of medical assistance for residents of the state , improved at the last minute by a tightening of eligibility requirements ; it raised the minimum wage ; it provided more adequate state aid to education ; it increased state help to the City University ; it required annual safety inspection for all automobiles and mandated direct election of district leaders . * * * But the list of things undone or done badly is far longer . The two houses failed so abjectly to fulfill their constitutional responsibility on legislative reapportionment that the Court of Appeals had to take over . Nor did the Legislature pass for a second time the constitutional amendment giving New York City the power to increase real estate taxes , on which the people should have had an opportunity to vote . It failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city transportation agencies . It repealed part of the full-crew law , but in deference to the labor lobby left the firemen still in their cabs , where they are no longer needed but cost the railroads millions annually . It defied public opinion by refusing to close serious gaps in the state 's code of ethics . It failed to act on a bill to permit the use of paper ballots for constitutional amendments at the fall election , thereby probably condemning thousands of voters to long waits in line . It refused to adopt a modified direct primary system for United States Senator , Governor and other statewide offices . - The legislators rejected the repeated pleas of neighboring states that New York raise the legal , age for buying liquor from 18 to 21 and thereby cut down on the tragic accidents along the state borders . They ignored off-track betting as a possible source of revenue for state and city . They resisted pleas to soften New York 's brutal law against abortion . They took no action to outlaw the savage sport of professional prizefighting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coverage . ? * * * The Legislature 's record is a mixed one , as might have been expected with control of the two houses divided by the major parties . But the list of its good deeds is too short and the record of its failures and omissions is too long to deserve much praise .
