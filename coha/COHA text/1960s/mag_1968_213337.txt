ON the site of Chicago 's International Amphitheatre , all manholes have been sealed with tar . A chain-link fence , seven feet high and topped with barbed wire , is going into place west of the arena . Secret Service men are checking every pipe , seat and rafter against bombs or snipers ' hiding places . Taking antiwar demonstrators at their word , Chicago officials are preparing for every possible disruption at next week 's Democratic National Convention . In the process , the nation 's second largest city is beginning to take on the appearance of a city under siege . <P> Protest groups hope to muster at least 100,000 marchers outside the amphitheatre the night that the nominee is selected , and security arrangements are being prepared accordingly . The city 's 11,500-man police force will be put on twelve-hour shifts during the week of the convention ; 5,500 riot-trained members of the Illinois National Guard are being alerted for duty . The Guard has been given permission to bivouac troops in two parks near the hall and in five public high schools . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amphitheatre , will be accessible only to special buses for a mile . Cross streets leading into it , from 39th to 47th Streets , will be closed to regular traffic . <P> Jail Tents . Employees at the Stock Yard Inn , where many of the delegates will eat at least once , have been checked for security . ( Three failed to meet specifications , but were fired for " incompetence " before the test was completed . ) Secret Service agents will inspect all personnel and cargoes going into the stockyards . Other agents will be positioned to survey everyone arriving by public transport . Known militants and agitators will be shadowed as a matter of course . <P> Up to 2,000 Chicago cops and 1,000 federal agents will be in and around the amphitheatre during evening sessions . A special contingent of 200 firemen will also be on the grounds round the clock to answer special calls . The memory of last year 's multimillion-dollar holocaust that gutted the modern McCormick Place convention hall-it probably would have housed this year 's convention-is still painfully fresh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are prepared to put prisoners in tents in the jail yard . While the candidates trade charges on whether the convention is open or closed , it is , physically at any rate , the tightest in U.S. history-a kind of Stalag ' 68 . Already the demonstrators have achieved the feat of forcing a major party to pick a candidate for President behind barbed wire , in a charged atmosphere reminiscent of a police state . <P> Arrayed against the impressive show of official strength will be , if plans jell , one of the oddest , least cohesive armies in history-an uncoordinated alliance of hippies , yippies , antiwar militants , unhappy liberals and far-out radicals . Goals vary from outright disruption of the convention proceedings to a ribald mockery of the electoral system . The yippies ( members of the Youth International Party ) plan to nominate a 220-Ib. pig , Pigasus , for President , on a platform of garbage- " just like the platform of all the other parties . " Groups led by the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Viet Nam are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We want to focus attention on the war . "
