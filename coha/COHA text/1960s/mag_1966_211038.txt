IT was just an ordinary day . Mom was at the store , taking back a party dress she swore she had never once put on ( it was only slightly stained with lipstick ) . Sister , browsing in the Teen Scene department , was staring with fascination at a pair of earrings she might just forget to pay for , if no one was going to be looking too hard . Sonny was in school , doing pretty well on a math test by dint of some judicious copying from a friend 's paper . And Dad was busy at the office , adding a few fictitious lunches to his expense account and wondering about the feasibility of his company 's renting another suite in Miami to be written off as a business expense . <P> While this is hardly a picture of the typical American family , it does represent a pressing moral problem that has been largely obscured by the more dramatic issues of war , sex and civil rights . The problem is the erosion of Everyman 's conscience about how he conducts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ethical climate is made up of small , half-automatic decisions taken by ordinary people in response to life 's daily bumps and urgings . That climate in the U.S. today seems far from salubrious . <P> Some of the alarmists who see every act of dishonesty as a symptom of general corruption make the mistake of judging people by Utopian rather than human standards . A spark of larceny leaps in everyone , and the scene would be dull without it . Nor is the evidence about dishonesty clear-cut . <P> Everybody is supposedly eager to cheat the Government on his tax return . That impression is reinforced by the occasionally epic search of U.S. business for tax loopholes-which may be ethically debatable but are , by definition , not illegal . In fact , the American is a model taxpayer , and was so even before Internal Revenue installed its formidable , automated data-processing system known as " the Machine . " The Government last year indicted fewer than 2,000 out of 102.5 million taxpayers for fraud . Even the most pessimistic estimate of unreported income-$26 billion a year-suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Second only to taxes , credit is seen as an area of everyday fraud . Initially , America 's burgeoning credit-card business suffered considerable damage from high livers who could buy now but not pay later . The magic inherent in those little plastic rectangles hypnotized many into becoming adventurers-such as the man whose idea of the good life was to bed down in a variety of hospitals on stolen Blue Cross cards . But such abuses are now insignificant-thanks to more responsible screening of applicants and automated accounting techniques-even though credit keeps expanding . In department-store charge accounts , the default rate is only 1 % or 2% . The U.S. lives in a credit economy that is essentially based on trust and responsibility . <P> With all this conceded , there is still plenty of evidence to support those who fear that America is becoming a nation of smalltime chiselers . <P> <P> Boosters &; Snitchers
