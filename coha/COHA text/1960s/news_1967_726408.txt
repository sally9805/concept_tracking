txt Washington is talking seriously about the possibility of setting up a worldwide information center to gather and retrieve engineering and scientific data . Government officials think it could happen in the next 10 years . There are information systems of different types all over the world . Key to developing one central system would be agreement on standards for a " machine language " that could coordinate all the present systems . Responsibility for reaching such agreement will probably fall to international scientific and engineering organizations . A second part of the plan is a worldwide electronic system for searching patents  --  long a tedious and time-consuming hunt . This system would reduce information to universal language . And by satellite , cable , and wire it would link all national and regional patent systems of the world . The National Academy of Sciences has been working with the International Commission of Scientific Unions and other worldwide organizations to lay the groundwork for such an information system . The Soviets already have developed a national center , with 22,000 translator specialists on tap , rather than having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States and most other countries . American officials are thinking about using the standard reference data system of the National Bureau of Standards as its center . There is also an unreleased report to the Federal Council on Science and Technology setting guidelines for pulling federal agency information systems together . Experts say the project can succeed if the United States and the Soviet Union lead the way . Trends .. . Genetic engineering is a technique which men could take control of their ov ? i evolution at a basic level . It is fast being developed . Geneticists are concerned that men are not preparing equally fast to deal with its moral and social implications . They ask if it is wise to try to manage evolution in this way  --  that is , to try to breed a " better " race ? Who is to decide ? And who is to work out what might be done ? During a recent informal discussion , some geneticists pointed up such issues . They feel that too few people are alert to the implications of recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heredity . Generally speaking , it now is thought that the growth and development of organisms are guided by tiny chemical elements called genes . These are found in all bodily cells . Information carried by genes is supposed to determine that the offspring of , say , horses will be a horse , and so on . Evolution of new plant or animal species from existing ones is thought to be due partly to c .. 11anges in the genes . Judging from experiments now in progress , Dr. Marshall Nirenberg , of the United States National Institute of Health , thinks it may one day be possible to alter directly the information of the genes in ways of man 's choosing . This may be possible within two decades . Dr. Bentley Glass of the State University of New York suggests that within 20 years or so it may be possible actually to grow human embryos in test tubes . These would be selected and bred for certain genetic qualities . In this case , too , men would be directing evolution . By one means or another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility in our time . The big question is how this technique will be used and , indeed , whether men should try to use it at all . This is the issue that Drs . Nirenberg , Glass , and many other geneticists feel that people in all stations should begin to think about now . How and why ... Britain 's Rothamsted Experimental Station has achieved considerable success in extracting high-quality protein from leaves inedible to farm animals . Prototypes of a machine have been made here which will convert such farm waste into food for grazing stock . Virtually all protein consumed derives from plants , whether eaten directly or through meat . But of the thousands of land-plants known , only about 100 play a significant role in human or farm animal nutrition . There is a large reserve of plants which do not produce edible seeds , roots , or fruit . Now some of these may be processed into protein . The new machine pulps leaves with beater arms . The product ? take it or leave it ? is a pressed cake , 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheese .
