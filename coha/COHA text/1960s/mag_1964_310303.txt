If it ever gets serious , Lyndon Johnson 's war on poverty might be waged all around Hazleton , Pa. ( pop . 32,500 ) , which is perched amid deserted coal mines high on Spring Mountain in the heart of depressed and desolate Appalachia . But Hazleton has already fought a valiant anti-poverty war of its own . Moreover , it has done so with a minimum of federal help . <P> For years , the town lived respectably if not richly from coal mines and textile plants in the area . But after World War II , Hazleton found itself on the skids . One after another , the mines shut down . Between 1946 and 1958 , coalmine employment plunged from 14,000 to 1,750 ; young people began leaving town at the rate of a thousand a year . In Hazleton it became the rule rather than the exception for wives to plod off to work at sewing machines in the textile and garment plants while listless , jobless husbands stayed home to keep house . <P> Expensive Experience . Desperately , the Hazleton Chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a local silk plant announced that it would move to cheaper labor markets in Mississippi , 70 Hazleton businessmen signed mortgages totaling $50,000 to keep the factory in town . Within three years the plant moved South anyway-putting 2,000 people out of work . Refusing to give up , the chamber formed the Hazleton Industrial Development Corporation , raised $650,000 in bonds and contributions its first year , offered to donate $500,000 as a no-strings down payment on a $1,600,000 plant built to any prospect 's specifications . The Electric Auto Lite Co. ( now the Eltra Corp. ) , accepted the offer , but created fewer than 300 new jobs after the community thought it would employ at least 1,000 . It was an expensive , disillusioning experience . <P> In 1955 , Hurricane Diane crashed through-flooding and wrecking the few coal mines that remained . It was almost the death blow . Most of the mines never reopened , and 16% of Hazleton 's working force was unemployed . But the next year proved to be Hazleton 's turning point-for the better . <P> CAN DO . Dr. Edgar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of the Chamber of Commerce during the darkest days . Under his determined guidance , a 550-acre site near town was bought for $10 an acre as an " industrial development park . " Not long after , the Pennsylvania state legislature passed a law providing loans to towns that could scrape up outright contributions from townspeople-as well as bank loans-to attract new industry . Dessen got a local organization going to get the money , dubbed it CAN DO , then spent three weeks trying to dream up some words to fit the initials . Finally he came up with the coherent if colorless label , " Community Area New Development Organization . " <P> Goal of the first CAN DO drive was $500,000-a part to be acquired by selling 15-year 3% debenture bonds , the rest from donations . Dessen 's group put on heavy pressure , had every single contributor listed daily in the Hazleton Standard-Speaker , and classified the lists so that all lawyers or all employees of one factory were together-making for easy ( and occasionally embarrassing ) comparisons . To keep the pressure up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the names and amounts contributed . Within three weeks CAN DO was well over its quota , with $200,000 in cash and $540,000 in bond purchases .
