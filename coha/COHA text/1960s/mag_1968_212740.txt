While President Johnson kept his own counsel on the issue of additional U.S. troops for Viet Nam , the Senate for the first time in months held an angry debate on the war . What troubled its members-including some longtime supporters of the Administration 's policy-was the fact that Johnson was preparing to act without so much as a by-your-leave from Congress . " I think it would be a mistake , " declared Bobby Kennedy , " for the President to take a step towards escalation of the conflict without having the support and understanding of the Senate and of the American people . " The chief issue , said Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman J. William Fulbright , is " the authority of the Administration to expand the war without the consent of Congress and without any debate or consideration by Congress . " <P> Fulbright 's demand for a voice in any new decision was swiftly echoed . " I think we must insist upon that , " said New Jersey Republican Clifford Case . It also quickly spread into a wide-ranging attack on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question as to whether or not the war is winnable without the destruction of South Viet Nam and much of American might itself . " <P> Iowa Republican Jack Miller , proponent of a tough stance in Viet Nam , chimed in with a plea that " something should be done about a change in the conduct of the war . " Idaho Democrat Frank Church , a longtime critic , warned that the Administration seemed to be " poised to plunge still deeper into Asia where huge populations wait to engulf us , and legions of young Americans are being beckoned to their graves . " Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield was no less concerned . " We are facing today the most troublous days in the entire history of the Republic , and I bar no period in making that statement , " he said . " We are in the wrong place , and we are fighting the wrong kind of war . " He credited Johnson , however , with having " tried hard and vigorously and consistently to find a way to the negotiating table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not impugn his motives . " <P> <P> The most stinging attack came from Kennedy , further widening the gulf between him and Johnson 's Administration . " If we have learned anything over the last seven years , " he said , " it is the fact that just continuing to send more troops , or increasing the bombing , is not the answer in Viet Nam . We have tried that . Something different should be tried . " Precisely what , Bobby did not say . <P> Quit Talking . Only two Senators countered the critics . Texas Republican John Tower congratulated Johnson for " doing what a number of us have been saying for 2 years - that you can not win a war by gradual response , that the only way to achieve military victory is through massive air and sea superiority . " Crusty Ohio Democrat Frank Lausche did not defend the President so much as attack Fulbright . " The only way we can reach a decision is for the Senator of Arkansas to present a resolution to the Senate , " he proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he quit talking . "
