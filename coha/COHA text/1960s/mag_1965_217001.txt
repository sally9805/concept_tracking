THE LOCKWOOD CONCERN by John O'Hara . 407 pages . Random House . $4.95 . <P> <P> Since the deaths of Faulkner and Hemingway , John O'Hara is unquestionably the most famous of living American novelists . Yet he is notoriously discontented with this grudgingly conceded eminence ; he is given to complaints that he never won the highbrow vote or the Nobel Prize . And critics who find his work unsatisfactory put him into a considerable swivet . <P> However , there is evidence that O'Hara shares the critics ' dissatisfaction with his creatures-a circumstance that may explain his touchiness . At all events , in his latest novel O'Hara may again be seen at work like a frustrated Pygmalion , infuriated because the being he has articulated with such skill and wired for authentic speech is somehow , after all , not quite human . <P> Living Blight . The humanoid he has made and destroyed is George Bingham Lockwood of Swedish Haven , Pa. , St. Bartholomew 's ( ' 91 ) and Princeton ( ' 95 ) , a not-quite gentleman whose masterly style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every living thing within its reach . George Lockwood is first seen as he supervises the building of a manor house for himself outside the town where the murderous skulduggery of Grandfather Moses and the more genteel avarice of Father Abraham have made the Lockwoods one of the richest families in the area . But his chief ambition is to be the first Lockwood gentleman . <P> The house is no Xanadu ; it is built in the seemly red brick style of the region , but there is something extravagantly not right about it . Imported craftsmen have constructed a spiral staircase behind a secret panel in the wainscoting , and an eight-foot brick wall topped by spikes encloses a 30-acre park . <P> Something there is that does n't love a wall , wrote Robert Frost , and in this novel that something is the Pennsylvania Dutch peasantry on the farm lands and the immigrant Irish and Polish serfs in the coal " patches " upriver . A farm boy , intent on exploring the grounds , dies impaled on the spiked wall , and George bugs out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hush money to the family . Why does a man like this want to be a gentleman ? It seems that " becoming a gentleman " was an obsession that Father Abraham had developed and that he thought of as " the Lockwood concern " - concern being the Quaker word for a Friend 's special field of good works or vocation .
