 | U. S. Special Forces : The Faceless Army I N THE swamps and forests around Fort Bragg , N.C. , an army of faceless and nameless men is in training . No photographer may take a full-face picture of any of them , and even profile shots are permitted only when the man 's face is in shadow . Their names may not be connected with their duties . Where they have been no one will say . Where they will go can only be conjectured . They are the U.S. Army 's Special Forces ? soldiers ; experts in the dark-ofnight techniques of guerrilla warfare : above all , teachers .  | In small numbers , these stealthy specialists have been around since 1952 : the 7th Special Forces Group at Fort Bragg , the 10th at Bad Tolz , Germany , the 1st in Okinawa . And some in places that can not be mentioned . But now they are being augmented . President Kennedy has declared that the world 's communist nations will be met on their own ground ? subversion with subversion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hundreds of Special Forces men will have increased to thousands . Defending the free world . Obviously , however , the United States can not protect every national border ; nations must defend themselves . " In most areas of the world , " says President Kennedy , " the main burden of local defense against overt attack , subversion , and guerrilla warfare must rest on local forces . " How can the United States help ? With military teachers ? the best trained of any army in the world . Although Special Forces men can scrap like jungle cats , they will not . They are teach-and-run soldiers . They will never fire a shot at the enemy , never ambush a convoy , never send a bridge in fragments to the sky . Such matters are the subjects of their curriculum . The practice will be left to their students . " A Special Forces man is too valuable to be risked , " says Col. William P. Yarborough , commander of the Special Warfare Center at Fort Bragg and head of the Special Forces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " To that end , Special Forces ruthlessly eliminates the " gung-ho " ? over-recklesswarriors . " No heroes wanted , " it proclaims . Says one officer : " We believe in death ? but only for the enemy . " @# @# What makes them special ? How do you select men who will , against all American tradition , not aspire to the Medal of Honor ? Special Forces has a touchstone : maturity . Out go the unstable soldier , the disobedient soldier , the man who ca n't be counted on to be where he is supposed to be . About 20 percent of the men now in training for Special Forces will never make it . Some will be rejected for lack of " maturity . " Others will prove too gungho ; or unable to learn or to teach as a Special Forces man must . Or a man may have personal traits that would make him vulnerable to blackmail ? dangerous in a security-tight organization . Or he may not be able to get an FBI secret @#  | clearance ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it overly difficult or impossible for the FBI to certify his loyalty . The man who is accepted for training with Special Forces is , first of all , a volunteer . He is probably a bit older than the average soldier . . . married .. . a trained paratrooper . He has probably been in the Army for some time ? perhaps is a sergeant of the upper grades . In case he thinks he is already expert enough at the soldiering business , Special Forces will change his mind . Into the dark . He is already a trained parachutist , but that 's not enough . He learned to leap into the blue ? now he 'll learn to leap into the black . All Special Forces jumps are made at night . " It 's a cinch when we have enough time ? say half an hour ? to make several passes over the drop zone , " an officer said . " We can drop off a couple of men first and give them time to get to the ground before the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes down , and signal so the rest of us can rendezvous . But it 's another story when time is short . Then each man has to kick his gear out of the plane just before he jumps and watch it to the ground . Tricky stuff at night . " Before he entered Special Forces , the average combat soldier had learned how to fire his basic weapon ? a rifle or carbine , usually . He had also learned the rudiments of two or three other weapons : machine gun , mortar , automatic rifle . That 's not enough for Special Forces . Here , if he 's a weapons specialist , he 'll learn how to fire and maintain 14 different U.S. weapons and 27 foreign weapons . He 'll know how to shoot , and instruct on , just about any weapon his guerrilla pupils might lay their hands on . That includes bows and arrows . Throwing out the manual . The demolitions man has some surprises in store . too . The Army taught him all the standard ways to disassemble a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Special Forces will teach him the unstandard ways . He 'll learn how to use explosives ranging in power from supersecret stuff that makes ordinary TNT look like cake mix , down to homey , do-ityourself recipes involving pinches of this and that ? generally available ingredients that you might have in your own back yard . Simple first aid is not enough for a Special Forces medical specialist . He 'll get 41 weeks of rigorous hospital training . " Our medic is the closest thing in the Army to a real doctor , " says an officer . " He can remove an appendix , amputate a leg , or deliver a baby . " The operations and intelligence man will study subjects that would be completely appropriate to the Command and General Staff School . A sampling : Psychological Warfare Intelligence ; Prisoner of War Interrogation ; Military Aspects of Terrain ; Sketching ; Collecting and Processing of Information ; Counter Guerrilla Training ; Mountain Operations . He will become an expert on maps ? not only on U.S. military maps . but on any maps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earth . A DEMOLITIONS TAPE really two tape reels joined together ? gives readings in pounds of TNT instead of inches and feet . One tape is for timber , the other for concrete and steel . 58 POPULAR SCIENCE AUGUST 1961  | good operations man knows the symbols for a second-grade road or a telegraph line or a church on almost any of them . The communications man will learn to operate his radio ? and keep it operating ? under almost any conditions . No spare parts ? A short ? He 'll have no higherheadquarters repairman to call on . He 's the repairman . Combining the skills . The basic operating unit of Special Forces is the " A " Detachment , a self-sufficient 12-man team . It has two officers and 10 enlisted men ? two for each of the team 's five military specialties : operations and intelligence , demolitions , medical aid , communications , and weapons . In the field , at the commander 's discretion , the detachment can be neatly divided into two six-man teams , each also complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , higher-ranking oficers=to become a B or even C detachment . It is to one of these A Detachments that the newcomer to Special Forces is assigned when he has completed his orientation training and has received his security clearance . In most cases , this will be his permanent assignment ? through training and in operations . Here he completes those courses that make him a specialist . But that 's only a beginning . He 's got to be a subspecialist , too . So now he 's started off on his " cross-training " : three weeks each in three of the other four specialties . This is insurance . In the field , no detachment will ever be lacking a critical skill . If something happens to the two communications men , on average six of the other eight enlisted men will be able to operate the radios ? and that includes sending DEMOLITIONS TAPE really two tape reels joined together ? gives readings in pounds of TNT instead of inches and feet . One tape is for timber , the other for concrete and steel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Special Forces to teach trick for coming down a mountain fast . Rope , secured at top , passes through snap link tied to climber . Feet flat against wall , climber lets rope slide through link at controlled rate , and eases his way quickly to the bottom .  | and receiving Morse code . The same level of accomplishment goes for the other specialties . After he has been trained as a specialist and cross-trained in three other skills , what then ? From arctic to jungle . Then he packs his duffel bags and goes off : to Alaska ( for arctic training ) , to Panama ( for jungle training ) , to Pisgah National Forest , N. C. ( for mountain climbing . to Little Neck , Va . ( for amphibious training with the Navy , learning how to sneak out of a submarine on a dark night and row to shore in a rubber boat ) , to Key West ( for underwater demolitions ) , to Utah ( for ski training ) . Now the Special Forces man is almost ready for operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a specific country . He participates in an " area study " of the country , and learns the rudiments of its language . The area study teaches him something of the country 's geography , history , economics , politics , religions . He learns about the country 's ethnic composition . Do the people in the north speak the same language as those in the south , worship the same divinities , eat the same foods ? He is briefed on social customs : In some places , a social error could lose a mission . The language of war . He is given 12 weeks to learn a basic vocabulary of 800-850 words ? enough to communicate simple thoughts . What if he gets stuck while he is teaching , either because he does not know an expression , or the expression ? say " trigger housing group " ? does not exist ? Special Forces has a smart dodge here . He will teach his students the English word for the object . And he will use his hands . " Expressive hands , " says a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred words of vocabulary . " During those final weeks , also , he puts the polish on his guerrilla education . He studies textbooks on guerrilla warfare : by Mao Tse-tung , the leader of Red China ; by Ernesto Guevara , Fidel Castro 's lieutenant ; by T. E. Lawrence , Britain 's famous World War I guerrilla leader in Arabia . Now he is ready to put into effect the @#  | mathematics of guerrilla warfare . One A Detachment , Special Forces experts say , can train as many as 1,500 guerrillas . Well-trained and well-supplied guerrillas can tie down as many as 10-15 times their own number . Does that mean that one A Detachment could tie down 15-22,000 men ? a whole division ? Says shrewd Mao Tsetung : " Guerrillas are like fish , and the people are the water in which the fish swim . If the temperature of the water is right , the fish multiply and flourish . " In Cuba , a few fish multiplied into enough to win a country . Ahead lies an arduous and dangerous campaign . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparation , initial contact , infiltration , organization of guerrilla forces ? finally , combat . This is the program ahead . In the meantime , the Special Forces man is training hard . Among the maxims he will study is Mao Tse-tung 's famous dictum : " Guerrillas should be as cautious as virgins . "
