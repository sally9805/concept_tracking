The railroads have apparently decided to use all the legal pressure possible against what they deem to be an illegal strike because they believe they are facing a showdown with the union over a festering seven-year-old dispute on the use of firemen in locomotives . Industry sources also said the carriers could not drop their contempt actions without inviting other rail unions to strike on any issue with impunity . The firemen began their strike Thursday shortly after midnight on the ground that the railroads had refused to negotiate on a demand for an apprentice program to train firemen to become engineers .

A union spokesman said today that union vice presidents were instructed last night to make contact with the proper officials at each of the eight railroads to make arrangements to resume operations . He said that the strike would continue , however , until all eight roads agreed to the arrangements . The strike is an outgrowth of an old dispute over the need for firemen on freight and yard locomotives . When the roads and the union were not able to agree on the issue , Congress passed a law in 1963 providing for arbitration . The arbitration board ruled that most of the firemen were not needed on modern locomotives and ordered their gradual elimination , Philadelphia Dispute Ended PHILADELPHIA , April 2 ( AP ) ?
