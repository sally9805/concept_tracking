 | A DOCTOR TALKS SENSE ABOUT DIET Almost everybody agrees that being fat is bad for you . Fat people generally do n't live as long as those of normal weight , and they look , feel and act older than their years in the meantime . But you 've tried to lose weight and ca n't ? Let me tell you how I handle the problem in my office . Let 's say you 're in your twenties , thirties or forties ? younger women usually have n't begun to care , older ones have given up . You 're in the doctor 's office for a " checkup " because you always feel tired . Or perhaps you want to start on a weight-reduction program . Even more likely , though , you 're an " oh-by - the-  way- er . " What 's that ? Well , you 've had your sore throat checked or rash looked at ; as we are saying good-bye , you casually add , " Oh , by the way , what about my weight ? " So now settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by step . @# STEP ONE : Let 's get a few things straight You Can Lose . Most would-be weight losers are licked before they start ? consciously or not , they have already accepted defeat . They are willing to go through the motions of a weight-reduction program , but mostly to prove the futility of the whole thing ( " At least I tried " ) . Psychologically or emotionally . maybe some people wo n't lose . But that 's a different thing . Calories Do Count . " Not only that , they seem to add and multiply , " as one dieter put it . it 's really very simple , a matter of intake versus output . if the number of calories you take in averages more than the number of calories your body uses . you will gain weight . if calories-in average less than calories-out , you will lose weight . If there is a balance between need and expenditure , your weight will remain unchanged . Nothing very complicated about that , but many patients refuse to accept it . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , people will give up on get-thin-quick programs about the same time they abandon get-rich-quick schemes . There 's no lack of " crash diets " or two-week tickets to a " slender , youthful figure . " But if you are lugging around twenty to fifty extra pounds , you 'd better count on having to stick to the strict part of your diet for two to six months . Then you must find your ideal calorie intake and settle down for the long haul . There 's No Easy Way . If you 'll pardon the high-calorie figure of speech , there 's no way to sugarcoat an effective diet . It 's strong medicine , and there 's no sense in denying it . " Take pounds off the easy way " is an invitation to frustration and failure .  | There 's No New Way . So-called " revolutionary " diets , exciting " research breakthroughs " and weightloss programs " based on an entirely new principle " are usually nonsensical come-ons . Dieting Is Not a Part-Time Thing . It 's not something you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to eat . It 's a full-time twenty-four-hours-a-day , seven-days-a-week thing . Sorry to sound so uncompromising , but you do want to lose , do n't you ? All Men ( and Women ) Are Not Created Equal ? Biologically , That Is . " Well , if it 's calories like you say , how about my friend Gladys . She can eat anything and everything , and she 's as skinny as a rail ! " exclaims a patient defiantly . You might as well face the fact now ? if you have n't already ? that there are people like that . It is n't fair , I suppose , and we do n't understand why it should be so . But it is . Just do n't use it as a reason why you ca n't lose weight . Losing may be harder for you , but you can do it . One word of caution , though : Avoid Gladys for the duration of your diet . She 's bound to be bad on your morale . No Pill or Shot Will Take Off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I take to lose weight ? " They seldom say " What can I do ? " ) I always tell them bluntly , " There 's no medication that will take an ounce of flesh off you . There are pills and capsules that will help you control your appetite and combat the ' all-gone ' feeling that goes with dieting . But that 's all they can do . " It 's Up to You . Friends can kid you , families can urge you and doctors can advise and help you ? but in the final analysis it 's up to you . Dieting is a lonely business and that 's only one reason why so few stick to it . Let 's move on to Step Two . @# STEP TWO : Now answer a few questions What Did You Weigh When You Got Married ? This question usually brings color to the cheeks of women and embarrassed smiles to the faces of men . It reminds them that they were n't born fat , and it often provides some kind of mark to shoot at . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this question because it seems to provide an out . " Oh , weight runs in my family , " they exclaim excitedly . " My father weighs two hundred and thirty pounds , and my mother -- And you should see my sisters ! " I admit that the family glands could be the cause of all this avoirdupois . But I point out that the more likely cause is the family appetite ? not to mention the influence of a mother to whom chubbiness meant health and who felt hurt when anyone turned down a second helping or dessert , What Do You Look Like ? This calls for a degree of candor and self-inspection that many women ca n't muster . Go look in a mirror . Oh , no , the full-length kind . What 's that ? Well then , better get one . I do n't know of any more effective instrument of motivation than a fulllength mirror . Especially if you undress and coldly appraise your ; self , front , side and rear . Most of my obese patients live in houses where the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avert their glance when passing a big mirror . Next step : Look at some old pictures of yourself taken in your thin days . I would say compare these with some recent photos , but if you run true to form there is n't a single post-inflation picture of you ( especially a full-length one ) in the house . Right ? At parties , family reunions and the like you 're always the one who volunteers to work in the kitchen , has to go to the ladies ' room or does something else to make herself scarce while the pictures are being taken . How do I know ? Well , let 's just say I keep my eyes open . Why Do You Eat So Much ? This is , of course , a loaded question , the sort of **34;545;TOOLONG query which provokes patients into spasms of self-righteous denial . " I continued on page 260  | do n't know where all the weight comes from , " they moan . " I certainly do n't eat much . Why , take this morning , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the few noncaloric morsels which made up their breakfast . They forget or do n't mention the fact that weight-conscious people invariably starve themselves during the day or two before their doctor 's appointment . Also passed over is the fact that very few obese people ever eat any breakfast to speak of ( that 's part of their trouble , as I 'll explain later ) . When they see my face , they may retreat a bit . " Well , " they say brightly ? and hopefully ? " I guess it 's not that I eat so much . I just eat the wrong things . " This is progress on two counts : They have admitted the fact that it 's eating that has made them fat , and they have accepted the idea of calorie counting . What Are Your Eating Habits ? Most overweight patients eat little or no breakfast . " just a cup of coffee , " they say . It 's a point of pride with them and usually the jumping-off place for their tale of mystification as to why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of the fact that the no-breakfast ritual merely sets the stage for all-day nibbling or , when coupled with a skimpy lunch , a really ravenous assault on a calorie-laden evening meal . For most women the calorie crisis begins about midmorning . The older children have been packed off to school . Hubby has made his dash for the train or the highway . The baby has been put down for a nap . The stimulation of meeting deadlines wears off , and our overweight patient loses her momentum . Now the eating begins in earnest . Then comes lunch or " just a sandwich , " not mentioning the milk shake and dessert , either one of which may contain as many ( or more ) calories as the sandwich ( which , by the way , is seldom a low-calorie item ) . Then there 's a pick-me-up in midafternoon ( " something to give me a little energy ? I get so tired " ) . The pattern has infinite variations . One woman loves to cook , and , in the course of practicing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly knows she 's doing it ? but her waistline shows it . A young mother eats " a little something with the kids " at five or six o'clock and then , in effect , has a second meal with her commuter husband at seven P.M. " just to keep him company . " But the time when calorie consump-  | tion per minute per overweight ind. - dividual appears to reach its peak is between 7 and 11 P.M. ? prime evening television ( and snack ) time . Why Do You Want to Lose Weight ' Would-be weight losers have usually been overweight for months or years . Why the big push to lose just now ' The answers are always interesting and often provide an index of how successful the dieter is likely to be . A tubby woman in her forties comes steaming into the office . It seems s : : e was at a party the night before and was mistaken for her husband 's mother ' Or was introduced through an error as Mrs. Hempstead ? " who 's sixty if she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air of quiet resolution because her teenaged daughter has started looking at the figures of her friend 's mothers and has made unflattering comparisons . Class reunions have a remarkarle effect in resurrecting lost willpower . A woman may shrug off her children 's remarks , smile away her husband 's reproaches and rationalize her own excuses . But when it comes to facing a jury of her peers who will coldly appraise " how Mary looks " five , ten or twenty years since graduation ? that 's a different story . It can make a girl he awake nights ? even lose her appetite ' Dr. O'Donnell , a specialist in internal medicine , practices in Gloucester , Massachusetts . A graduate of Georgetown University School of Medicine , he has held research and teaching appointments at several hospitals and has written many articles for medical journals and general magazines . He is the father of seven children . Do You Really Want To Lose Weight ' When I ask patients this question , they exclaim , " What ? Why of course I do ' Would I be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with the hard question : How badly do they want to lose ? Badly enough to face weeks , even months , of self-denial and self-discipline ? Badly enough to be merely merry while all the others are eating and drinking too ? Badly enough to endure those lonely seesaw battles in which you 're sure nothing is so important as having that cake or candy ? If you ca n't answer yes , better turn back now . Otherwise , you wo n't lose weight , but you will gain a guilt complex . STEP THREE : Next go and see your doctor Many overweight people skip this step . Of course , it is possible to lose weight without a doctor 's supervision . Nevertheless , consulting a doctor is still a good idea . Even more important from my point of view , it 's a test of your sincerity . If you 're willing to spend the time , trouble and money , your chances of success already take a leap forward . The Checkup . A basic medical exami-@# @#  | nation is the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes a good history of the patient 's family background and health , a thorough physical examination and a few laboratory tests . The special questions the doctor asks himself in the case of the obese patient are : ( 1 ) Is this the usual story of too many calories ? Or is this one of those rare cases in which there are glandular or other factors at work ? ( 2 ) Is it safe to prescribe appetite-suppressing drugs or other medication to this patient ? Or does the presence of coronary disease , etc. , make this hazardous ? ( 3 ) Are there any special precautions which should be observed in the diet prescribed or the rate at which this patient is encouraged to lose ? For example , does she have diabetes or other problems which might make unduly restrictive diets or too rapid loss unwise ? Diets . I warned you not to expect any magic diets from me . I 'm not even much of a believer in the conventional type , listing suggested breakfast , luncheon and dinner menus . Too rigid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the printed diet tends to reaffirm the notion that one diet is better than another . This is not true . It 's calories that count ? re-member ? My main reliance is on re-educating the patient through the use of the calorie diary . More about this shortly . Drugs . Most physicians will give pills to curb the appetite or calm the nerves of would-be weight losers . But that 's all . In truth , there 's nothing else to give . The most potent agents must be supplied by the patient ? motivation , willpower and determination . Follow-up . Better than anyone else , the physician can play the dual role of benevolent enforcer and objective observer . He will feel free to say things that nobody else would dare to , and is unlikely to be taken in by implausible self-justifications . My advice is : Go and see your doctor at not longer than two-week intervals . STEP FOUR : Now the diet I have one not-too-successful weight loser who paraphrases Mark Twain 's comment on smoking : " Oh , going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of times . " And so it is . It 's sticking to the diet that 's hard . Take the Long View . Once you 've made your decision , stick to it . Do n't redecide at every encounter with food or drink . If you do , there 's bound to be at least one time when your willpower will be at low ebb . Result : A decision in favor of " **25;581;TOOLONG . " That first exception to the rule makes every subsequent one just that much easier , and pretty soon your diet will be a memory . " I just decided this was going to be it , " confided one successful weight loser . " I was n't going to weigh myself every day ? or even once during the whole diet . And I was n't going to try to sell myself on the idea each and every day of the diet . I was on it for the duration ? gain , lose or draw . Taking all @#  | the thinking out of it made it a lot easier " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insight into the psychology of overweight people . At the doctor 's ? or anybody else 's ? merest hint , they will buy and take twenty-five dollars ' worth of pills weekly , lay out hundreds of dollars for an exercise machinne , struggle through hours of complicated gymnastics in solitary misery or classes , and travel all over in search dietetic foods . But will they keep a calorie diary ? Something that costs them almost nothing , takes only a few minutes a day ? and practically ensures the success of their diet ? No . Some , it 's true , will start , but I do n't think there 's one would-be weight - loser in twenty-five who continues it . The reason others find for abandoning the role of being their own calorie policeman are many , and mostly all selfdeiving substitutes for the real reason . " It 's very simple , " I say . " All it takes is a little book with calorie values , a notebook and a pencil ? and about five minutes of your time each day . Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " Two weeks later I ask for the calorie diary ? and get only excuses . " Oh , I know what I eat , it 's the same every day " ; or " I looked all over and could n't find a calorie book anywhere " ; or " Oh , I left it on top of the bureau at home " ; and so on . Patients , I find , do n't like to be their own policemen . Keeping a calorie diary reduces a weight-losing program to cold hard figures that make it almost impossible to deceive oneself . But faithfully keeping a calorie diary increases a patient 's chances of losing weight about tenfold , in my experience . How Many Calories ? There is no precise answer to this question because people vary in their ability to tolerate diets . Assuming the dieter is basically healthy and will remain under medical supervision , it really comes down to : this : Should she try to lose fast or slowly ? Ideally , a slow , deliberate approach is best . Those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . Realistically , people are people and they want to see results or they 'll soon quit .  | Most of my patients therefore go on an 800-calorie-per-day program. * I let them make up that total out of almost anything , within reason , they want . If they follow orders and keep a diary , I get a chance to see what they are eating and can put a diet back in balance if it gets too wild . I aim for a loss of about two pounds per week or a little less than ten pounds per calendar month . Motivation stays pretty well nourished at this rate of loss , I find . At this point many a despairing patient wails , " You mean I 've got to eat like this for the rest of my life ! It 's not worth it ! " Which brings us to the distinction between a weight-losing diet and a weight-maintenance diet . I hasten to emphasize the fact that the beginning dieter is getting less food than she really needs so that she will lose weight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure ( meaning both pounds as seen on the scale , and silhouette as viewed in the mirror ) she can gradually increase her calorie allowance to a nogain , no-loss level . This is obviously considerably above the skimpy rations of her diet . Exercise ? I have nothing against exercise , but it 's hard to imagine a more inefficient way to lose weight . You 'd have to run or walk for miles or exercise for hours to match the effectiveness of an equivalent period of sharp calorie reduction . So as part of a program of overall body conditioning or as a means of streamlining and redistributing body tissue after weight loss or as a means of diversion ( to keep you away from the table ) , exercise is great . But as a way of shedding excess weight ? especially as a substitute for diet ? it leaves much to be desired . Eating Techniques . Sometimes a poor loser with a long string of diet flops in the past will finally succeed because somebody thought to emphasize such reminders as : Eat slowly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't eat while nervous or tense ; divide your daily allowance into small , frequent meals ; after eating , get up from the table immediately and busy yourself doing something ; line up projects to do and places to go in the evening so you wo n't just salivate in front of the TV set ; and , of course , do n't keep any snack items in the house . Gimmicks . Many a diet has been snatched from oblivion by the use of an imaginative gimmick . One rotund housewife segregates all her tempting high-calorie food in one cabinet , locks it and solemnly hands the key to her husband as he goes off to work in the morning . Another has copies made of her most embarrassing photograph and posts these on her kitchen cabinets and on the refrigerator door ? as a stern reminder of what she is fighting for . @# ay e store .

And , of course , one of the time-honored ways to lick any problem is to organize : get together a group of fellow weight watchers in a sort of personal anti-calorie crusade . Like Alcoholics Anonymous and similar emotionally linked groups , such an approach can be very effective . Whether organized formally in the manner of TOPS ( Take Off Pounds Safely ) or Weight Watchers , Inc. or loosely as an offshoot of the bridge or bowling club , it exploits the **26;608;TOOLONG ( and willpower ) and misery-loves-company streak present in all of us . STEP FIVE : Do n't kid yourself I 've already mentioned this business of kidding yourself ? or rationalization , to put it on a loftier plane . Underlying it is the very human desire to find a face-saving way to get out of doing what we know we should do . It 's probably overstating the case to say that weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be exempted from having to try .

" I got sick and you know you have to keep your strength up . " ? " I lost twenty pounds and nobody even noticed it . It 's not worth it . " The examples could go on and on . They all have three things in common : They are all partially true ; they all could be resolved with just a little foresight or willpower ; and they are all substitutes for the real reason for failure .
