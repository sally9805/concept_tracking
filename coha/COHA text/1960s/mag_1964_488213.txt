Of several major public issues raised by the Warren Commission ( the report will be critically evaluated by Herbert Packer of the Stanford Law School in a later issue of The Nation ) those relating to the role of the police and the media ? Chapter V ? should command top priority . Everyone knows what happened because nearly everyone saw it happen A herd of reporters , of all media , succeeded in creating a tumultuous and chaotic atmosphere in the police headquarters . " You had to fight your way in , " said one police officer . The near-blinding floodlights , the maze of equipment , the janispacked corridors , the noise and confusion , all this and more , in the words of the report , created " a bedlam of confusion " One FBI agent , quoted in the report , said that conditions at the police station were " not too much unlike Grand Central Station at rush hour , maybe like the Yankee Stadium during the World Series . ' , ' In the midst of this pandemonium , the thief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world audience , along with a few solid facts , many erroneous disclosures and a great deal of other misinformation These became the bases for the myths and rumors that confused the nation and the world : In the process , Oswald 's guilt was prejudged to a degree that would have made a fair trial in Dallas virtually impossible . The chief of police was so busy conducting ambulatory press conferences and appearing on radio and television  --  twelve appearances in the period November 22-24 ? that he could not sit in on the interrogations of Oswald . What the commission has to say on this score is painstaking , fair and devastating . One can not quarrel with its major ' conclusion that " primary responsi'bility " for those incredible scenes must rest with the police Granted that the public 's interest  --  of fantastic volume and intensity  --  was perfectly legitimate , still the police could have maintained order in their own headquarters if nowhere else ; indeed , if they had done so , the public would have been much better informed . The fact is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by electing " to go along with " the press , created the confusion it later deplored . Nor can one quarrel with the commission 's conclusion that the media must also be charged with a measure of responsibility for what happened . It is true that the mass coverage of major trials  --  aggravated by the advent of the electronic media  --  threatens to subvert the concept of a public trial by substituting for it a trial by the public . It is also true that the media should work out some ground rules ( traffic regulations would perhaps be a more appropriate term ) for the coverage of major criminal proceedings and should show generally'a far higher degree of self-restraint than was exhibited at Dallas . But the commission 's ' suggestion that the media meet their responsibilities by adopting a code of professional ethics is not convincing . It is not merely the right but the duty of the media , in covering a major event of this sort , to press hard to uncover every item of interest and relevance . On occasion , the press has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , often in the face of active opposition from police and prosecution It has also helped to convict guilty defendants , despite the active opposition of defense counsel . But in Dallas the press was not assisting in the administration of justice but rather interfering With it . True , the police encouraged them to move in and take over . But more significant was the action of the district attorney which the Warren Commission tends to minimize . He too elected " to go along with the press . " In a ' major criminal case the district attorney , who is responsible for the prosecution , must direct the investigation . He can control and direct the police or , if necessary , he can appeal to those who can . In Dallas , both the police and the district attorney , by catering to the press , succeeded in diverting it from its main role and function . Instead of congregating in the ' corridors of the police station , waiting for a chance to badger the police and shout ' questions at Oswald , the press should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact is that the press has become far too dependent on what police , prosecution and defense counsel  --  and on occasion even judges  --  feed them in the way of information or misinformation . And whenever the press operates as a herd , it usually acts like a herd  --  that is , stupidly . The press did a bad job in Dallas , not because it pressed too hard for information or ' because it ( had too many reporters on the scene , but because it did not dig hard enough for the facts . If the press had done its job thoroughly , many ' of the myths and rumors would never have been set in motion , or would have been promptly corrected . A code of professional ethics by which the press would agree to restrict coverage of major trials would not remedy this fault ; on the contrary it might aggravate it . Nor would a code of ethics by which the media agree to " pool " information get at the root of . the real problem . " Pooling " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pool of reporters , four or five in number , will be found playing poker in the pressroom of the courthouse , waiting for someone to drop by and tell them that ' something of public interest is happening somewhere in the building . More pertinent than criticism of the police and press  --  although such criticism . is deserved  --  would be criticism of bench and bar . A judge can control proceedings in his courtroom ; the Ruby trial is a distasteful example of what happens when a judge decides to do what Chief Curry and District Attorney Wade did , namely , " to go along with the press . " Lawyers , as officers of the court , can be held accountable for their actions . Much of the distorted , inaccurate or misleading information about trials that appears in the press is not turned up by reporters digging for facts birt is passed along to them by lawyers  --  defense and prosecution  --  who seek to use the press to help them acquit or convict The problem is one of roles and missions . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or undigested tidbits likely to create an unfavorable ( or favorable ) clithate of opinion when a trial is in process Or an investigation under way ; much less is it the function of bench or bar . Nor , by the same token , is it the role of the press to help them play this game The press is more than a conveyor of infoimation or misinformation ; it has its own function to Perform ' Press and police , bench and bar , each has its role to play in the administration of justice ; the trouble arises when they forget what it is that each is supposed to do . It would be a mistake , ? therefore , if in response to the commission 's suggestion the press were to adopt a Code of ethids , one effect of ' which might well be to make it even more dependent than it is today on what poliCe and law-enforcemerit offiCials  --  and defense ' ' counsel  --  have to say about pending criminal cases . The Iceberg An analogy to the submerged and more lethal 85 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributions of American industry to right-wing causes . It is a matter that Sen. Lee Metcalf has been investigating . Senator Metcalf specializes in the machinations of investor-owned utilities ? a term which the companies use in their propaganda and which the Senator abbreviates to IOU . The September 25 Congressional Record contains a compendium of Senator Metcalf 's IOU findings . It calls ' to mind that here and abroad  --  first in Italy and then in Germany  --  a major question about right-wing activities has always been : who picks up the check ? The visible iceberg  --  that bizarre assortment of characters who act out their troglodyte fantasies on the American political scene  --  would be of little consequence were it not covertly supported by truly significant elements , like those benefactors uncovered by Senator Metcalf A typical case is that of Central Illinois Public Service Company . In 1963 the Federal Power Commission apparently became ' disturbed about utility operating expenses itemized under such heads as " Charitable , Cultural and ' Civic ' Contributions " ' and " Miscellaneous Expenses . " ' Central Illinois , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1962 a lump-sum total of $39,492 under " Donations for Charitable , Social or Community Welfare " Some of the contributions were to unassailable causes  --  the United Fund , the YMCA , the Boy Scouts , local colleges , hospitals , ' etc The breakdown included an entry of $10,512 , labeled " various civic activities , social projects , etc . " The FPC did not xequest a further explanation , but the inquisitive Senator Metcalf was not satisfied . Again the contributions included such innocuous causes as Little League baseball , but the " civic , social and school activities " alsb included handouts to the Manion Forum , the National Education Program , American Economic Foundation , Educational Reviewer , Foundation for Economic Education and the Committee for Constitutional Government The largest contribution was $500 , the smallest $100 , but why were they made at all , and why so surreptitiously ? Smularly , the Southwestern Public Service Company of Texas was , serving the public with ' contributions to the Manion Forum , Southern States Industrial Council , Committee of One Million , Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One might suppose that ' these contributions were made for the " nuisance value " of the supplicants  --  it is easier to give than to have them ' knocking at the door . But this ignores the multiplicity of right-wing organizations to which the consumers ' money is ' being handed out , the parallel aims of utility and right-wing propaganda , and the fact that gifts to institutions ? of learning are normally made to those in the utility 's home state , while Harding Ccillege , for example , receives IOU support from other quarters . Some utility companies refrain from contributing to the right wing and some itemize speci'ficall'y and clearly On the other hand , Senator Metcalf lists unidentified lump-'sum contributions in 1963 of $643,135 by Houston Light &; Power , $733,661 ' by Cleveland Electric Illuminating ' Company and , the most generous and elusive of all , Detroit Edison with $815,006 . " I think , " says ' Senator Metcalf , " the public has a right to know when its local power Company supports groups which find treason in our churches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so too . U.S. ? Brazilian Witch Hunt Whenever , a counterrevohition takes place anywhere on earth , it can almost be predicted that some arm of the United States will turn out to be implicated . When the military overthrew the Goulart government in Brazil , the Johnson Administration applauded the coup . Probably it also applauded itself for helping in the ouster of a President who , whatever his failings , was constitutionally in office . Certainly the generals who booted Goulart  --  and the progressive elements in the country aldng with him  --  were the good , friends of their opposite number in the U.S. military establishment ; many of them had taken postgraduate training in American military schools . During the changeover there was the usual roughing-up and imprisonment of progressives , CommuniSt and non-Communist alike . This ' could be discounted as the inevitable accompaniment of a revolution , soon , apologists assured us , everything 17004 return to normal Instead , the counterrevolutionary terror has grown worse It is directed particularly against intellectuals , and the most obvious targets are university people . Allen Yoling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rio de Janeiro , reports that Brazilian intellectual life " i 's reeling under the forceful - au.in ' of the military governine'nt which took power here nearly six ' months ago . " Young ' quotes Alceu Amoroso ' Lima , one of Brazil 's outstanding authors , whom the authorities are afraid to touch because he is a prominent Roman Catholic layman , now 70 years old and with an international reputation Mr. Lima refers to the victims of " cultural terrorism , all the more aibominable because it is ' covered up . " Private advides amply support this charge . Hunting for nonpatriotic subversives , " military police inquiries are ' carried ' on in the universities almost as part of the curricula , one purpose no doubt being to keep the StudentssubmisSive-The inquisitors ' Will barge in on a professor conducting a Class or an oral examination and proceed to ask queStions ' of ' their ' own . On September ' 11 , according to Fokla de Sao Paulo , described as a ' conservative ' newspaper , Prof. Florestan Fernandes , an internationally known sociologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dol . Bernardo SchuMann , in charge ' of the military police ' inqUiry at the Faculty ' of Sciences and Letters : FlOrestan Fernandes , while under investigation , was ordered to sing the last verse of the national anthein . ' He ' excused himself bedauSe ' of the imperfections of his voice , but recited the required ' part of ' the anthem . Then he wrote a letter of protest , ' first aSkirig ColOnel Schinnann'whether he had the ' right to do - so . , Schurnarm took the letter and declared it " arrogant . " When Florestan Fernandes refused to retract his protest , he was arrested . This is not an isolated instance . Other ' scholars who have not been arrested or forced out have chosen to emigrate , some have found refuge in American universities , In this sense the United States IS still a , free country  --  but it is an accomplice before the fact in the destruction of freedom elsewhere . , The beauty ' of cities is as much a human heritage a 's the beauty'of land and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak , in cities , and whoever has added to the beauty of a city has earned the gratitude of'those who live or work or ' visit there . Conversely , a special curse should descend on . those who despoil a city of such grace and beauty as it has Managed to ' achieve . With malignant speed , the cities of America are being so despoiled . ' In Europe , tradition and tourism exert a mitigating influence which , in the United States , is so weak that ' anyone with capital can override it . Only fools would take lightly the outraged tone of the article by pichard J. Whalen in the September Fortune , " A City DestrOying Itself " Whalen is writing about New York , and about utility as well as aesthetics , but the two are tied together . The fact that the expostulation appears in the most prestigious organ of American business will not deter the real-estate ' speculators Who figure in terms ' of dollar 's per ' ' square foot ' Of land , phis the costlof demolition of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrowed money to erect yet another high- " rise , high-rent , high-luXury barracks on the site . What they demolish may be a dump or it may be a pricelessarchitectural treasure ; that does not concern these gentlemen . No individual today is rich and powerful enough to thwart the ' hucksters of building . Vincent Astor wanted to raise a monument to himself in the form of a slim tower on Park Avenue with some air around it . With the ' Seagram Building across the way ( where the tax collector is simultaneously teaching that it does n't pay to try to combine profit and art ) an open space would have been created ' Created is the word , in a place like NeVy York , but it turned out that even Astor could not invest and borrow enough to complete the project . Finally he gave the and died , the First National City Bank took over the site , and it is now occupied by just another bulky office building . Another variety of aesthetiC crime is ' about to be perpetrated in an elite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1946 ' the Institute of ' Radio Engineers , a non . profit organization , bought the Brokaw mansion at 1 East 79 Street , on the corner of Fifth Avenue The mansion is no antique  --  construction was started in 1887 and ' completed in 1890 ? but it is a lovely reproduction of a ' chateau in the Loire Valley , and ' it adorns its neighborhood ' . The IRE , now the Institute of Electrical and ' Electionies Engineers , has sold this real estate to a builder and the chateau will be turned over to the ' wreckers . ' The ' City Landmarks COmmission is wringing its hands , but that seems to be about all it can do . Apparently the only way to preserve a landmark is to leave it an endowment , as ' Henry Clay Frick did Tor his mansion-museum down the Avenue ? $15 million in early 20th-century Cash . East and West and in between , it is all the same .

The California Un-American Activities Committee should look into this fellow 's ideas and associations . His brand of sarcasm endangers free enterprise . Good Advertising The anti-cigarette clamor which followed the release of the " Report of the Surgeon General 's Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health " has died down to a whisper . The nation 's health was to be protected , youth was to be deterred from future addiction , and those whO persisted in smoking cigarettes were at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caution . Whileproclaiming an " era of action , " Surgeon General Luther L. Terry warned that in considering ! a reform of a nation 's smoking habits one had to think " in terms of a program of ten years plus . " It does look that way . s The reasons for slow progress are obvious . The tobacco bloc is strong in Congress  --  tobacco is the country 's fifth largest cash crop . The industry is well heeled and excelled by none in the arts of political infighting . On the plus side , the Public Health Service had put a strong weapon into the hands of the Federal Trade Commission and the commission promptly announced that , ' starting January 1 , all cigarette packages must carry a warning that smoking may cause death from cancer and other diseases . In acting iso promptly the commission showed unwonted boldness , it is generally a rather timid , slow-moving body And in this case , ' too , it seems to have lost some ' of its initial vigor : ' the warning requirement has now been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July rolls around it may be postponed again Only an optimist , and one unfamiliar with the history of crusades in the United States , could be completely sure he would ever see that notice on a cigarette pack . However , the anti-smoking drive has now been given a boost from an unexpected quarter . Emerson Foote , one of the nation 's foremost advertising executives , resigned as chairman of McCann-Erickson , the nation 's second largest advertising agency . McCannErickson 's sins in the matter of cigarette advertising are not committed in the United States ; it has not hada domestic cigarette account since 1961 , when it lost Liggett &; Myers It does , however , handle considerable business in this line abroad , and Mr. Foote said flatly , " I will not have anything to do with any agency which promotes the sale of cigarettes anywhere in the world or which wishes to ' acquire a cigarette account . " While the anti-smokers applauded , Madison Avenue was shaken . Off the recprd , it was suggested that cigarette advertising was not the real issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were other things about McCann-Erickson that Mr. Foote did not like , for an executive so experienced  --  he has been in advertising for thirty-four years and with McCann-Erickson for ' thirteen  --  this would be possible But by all outward evidence , there is a genuine conflict between McCann-Erickson 's policies and Mr. Foote 's convictions . ( A chain smoker for thirty years , he quit completely five years ago . ) He is willing to help sell alcoholic beverages : because , in moderation , he does not find ' them deleterious to ' health . He is a member of the President 's Commission on Heart Disease , Cancer and Stroke . He is a former chairman of the executive committee of the American Cancer Society and has held many other offices in similar organizations . He is wealthy . It is a reasonable assumption that he is also honest and , at 57 , wants to do something for mankind . Madison Avenue might be better advised to express pride in him , rather than disapproval or skepticism . But in that case , would it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
