txt B.O.A.C. to Build $19 Million Terminal Herel The New York Times ( by Cart T. Gossett Jr . ) Model of British Overseas Airways Corporation terminal planned for Kennedy Airport The British Overseas Airways Corporation announced yesterday that it would build a $19.6-million passenger terminal at Kennedy International Airport . It will be the first terminal to be built in this country by a ' foreign carrier . The starkly functional threelevel structure of reinforced concrete and tinted glass will be started next January and is scheduled for completion early in 1968 . It will occupy a 26-acre site adjacent to the American Airlines terminal , the last open area in the airport 's Terminal City complex , and will also be used by Air Canada , British West Indian Airways and Qantas Airways . The announcement was made at a press conference at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel by Sir Giles Guthrie , the chairman of the airline . He arrived here on Thursday on the maiden B.O.A.C. flight of the VC-10 four-engine jetliner . The plane went into regular service yesterday . On Thursday the airline also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net profits of $319.2 million and $19.6 million , respectively . At a luncheon sponsored by the British-American Chamber of Commerce , Roy Jenkins , Britain 's Aviation Minister , praised the VC-10 as " a superb aircraft . " He said that he hoped that in the future lower air fares would increase British tourism in the United States . Although the British Government has announced that the aircraft industry was to be curtailed as an economy measure , Mr. Jenkins denied that it was " moribund . " However , he said that in the future major projects would , like the current development of the Concorde jet , be undertaken jointly with other nations , most likely France . At the news conference , Sir Giles , a slender , sandy-haired man of 48 who wore an Old Etonian necktie of light blue stripes , on dark blue , said that one reason for the airline 's decision to build its own terminal had been a wish to improve the American adverse balance of payments .

" Although he called the terminal " the most advanced airport building in the world , " Sir Giles acknowledged that the design might look " just a little square . " A scale model on display showed a main building with a flat overhanging roof , which can be used as a helicopter landing pad , and inward sloping glass walls . There will be nine loading bays in a long " finger " and at the back of the building . Five more bays can be added in a second " finger " if needed . One of the loading bays will be roofed to allow for maintenance and servicing in bad weather . The terminal will also have mechanical baggage handling , shops , a restaurant and cocktail lounge , and its own customs and immigration staff . Edmund F. Ward , a partner in the London architectural firm that designed the building , said the planners had avoided " a funny shape " in favor of functional design .

" B.O.A.C. is second in size to Pan American among international carriers in terms of passenger-miles flown each year . It carries 35 per cent of all passengers between New York and London , the only European point to which it flies directly from here . In the design of the terminal , Sir Giles said , the airline is anticipating the continued growth of its trans-Atlantic operations . In 1957 , the year in which it moved into its present terminal in the East Wing building at Kennedy airport , B.O.A.C. and the other three airlines that will share space with it handled a total of 140,000 passengers . The total this year is expected to be 570,000 . By 1968 , when the terminal opens , it is expected to be 1.5 million , and 2 million by 1975 . These figures take into account , Sir Giles said , an anticipated sharp increase in traffic to and from Canada and the West Indies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A , C. , Lufthansa-German Airlines , Alitalia Airlines , Irish Air Lines and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines . At present , there are eight terminals at Kennedy , including the old domestic arrivals building that is scheduled to be torn down .

Tobin , executive director of the Port of New York Authority , which operiates the airport , called the terminal " another gem " in the tiara of beautiful buildings there .
