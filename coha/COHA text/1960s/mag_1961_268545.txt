A Political Decision Which the Soldiers Did Not Reverse <P> Compressing a momentous year of wartime history into a few sentences , a new State Department pamphlet titled Background-Berlin , 1961 has drawn strong complaints from Republican Congressmen because it seemed to blame Dwight Eisenhower for allowing the Russians to capture Berlin . Last week the State Department announced that the questioned passage would be rewritten . The Department 's backtracking was appropriate-for in fact the cold-war history of Berlin is one that keeps getting added to , but has seldom been added up right . <P> IN the cold , wet spring of 1945 , the Allied Expeditionary Force under General Dwight Eisenhower crossed the Rhine and began the great sweep across the German plain toward juncture with Soviet armies advancing through Poland ( see map ) . On April 12 armored units of Lieut . General William H. Simpson 's Ninth U.S. Army reached the Elbe River near Magdeburg and Tangermnde , and thus came within 60 miles of Berlin . At that moment , Marshal Georgy Zhukov 's Russian troops were bogged down 35 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two months against the savage opposition of Hitler 's Eastern Front armies to gain a foothold across the Oder River . Simpson asked if he should push on to liberate Berlin . Instead , he was told by Eisenhower to consolidate his position while spreading troop units north and south along the Elbe 's west bank . As Simpson did so , the Soviet army swarmed across the Oder in force ; Berlin fell to Zhukov on May 2 . <P> The Main Prize . The decision to hold back the Ninth Army was made by Ike for military reasons that seemed plausible at the time-and still do . Before Dday , Ike had listed Berlin as his primary military target , a priority made on the assumption that the Wehrmacht would concentrate about the city and defend it to the death . In September 1944 , Britain 's Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery urged " one really powerful and full-blooded thrust toward Berlin " through northern Germany . " Clearly , Berlin is the main prize , " Ike answered . He added that a slower , " broad front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : destroying Germany 's military strength . By moving en masse , the AEF would thus be able to seize the industrial heart of Germany ( the Ruhr ) before striking at its political heart ( Berlin ) . <P> After the Allied armies crossed the Rhine in March 1945 , Monty renewed his request for a northern drive on Berlin . This time he was championed by Prime Minister Winston Churchill , who felt that political considerations should heavily influence military strategy as the war in Europe drew near an end . " If the Russians also take Berlin , " he wrote to F.D.R. on April 1 , " will not their impression that they have been the overwhelming contributor to our common victory be unduly imprinted on their minds , and may this not lead them into a mood which will raise grave and formidable difficulties in the future ? We should march as far east into Germany as possible , and that should Berlin be in our grasp we should take it . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
