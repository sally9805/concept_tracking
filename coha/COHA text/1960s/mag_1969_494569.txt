John and Mary ( 20th Century-Fox ) Notes on a Cowardly Lion by John Lahr ( Knopf ; $8.95 ) The best thing about John and Mary is that it recently prompted two funny articles in the New Statesman ( of London ) . On October ao the author of the original novel , Mervyn Jones , recounted how his " trivial little book " had been bought to be filmed on a small scale in London , how he had declined to write the screenplay because the offer was made in a restaurant so noisy that it irritated him , how he learned subsequently that the scale and the locale and the director had been changed . When he was finally able to read the screenplay ( no easy job to get a copy ) , " I came across occasional reminders of my novel . " It was now to be directed by Peter Yates , so " I went to see Bullitt , directed by Mr. Yates . The direction and photography were obviously remarkable , and it was probably my fault that I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the characters . " When Jones learned that Mia Farrow had been cast as Mary , he had further apprehensions because " a theme of some importance in my novel is that Mary is endowed with , and John is attracted by , the feature known as a derrMre en poire . " Nevertheless , he concluded : " I do look forward to seeing John and Mary at my local Odeon . " ( Poor man . ) His article was called " On Being Filmed . " Two weeks later , John Mortimer , who did the screenplay , weighed in with " On Filming Mr. Jones . " It was amusing , first , because Mortimer assumed two conventional phony hauteurs : the literary type who has gone slumming in Movieland for money and expects other Parnassiansto understand , and the Briton who has gone slumming in Yankeeland for money and expects compatriots to understand . Basically his piece was an affected apologia for hack-writing ( and the script is certainly a hack job ) ? something that many great writers have done but for which few have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dizzily " conferenced " and how he was administered doses of New York atmosphere ( the new locale ) as if they were intravenous infusions . I have n't read Jones 's novel , but the film makes me we , nder what all the fuss was about . The studio could have blindfolded a four-year-old child , asked him to reach up to the dusty shelves of thirties comedy-romances and pull down any one of them for remake . All they had to do then was update the slang and change the sex-hints to sex . In 1935 Claudette Colbert would have looked cute in Fred MacMurray 's oversize pajamas as she snuggled virginally into his bed , while Fred tried to duke himself comfortable on the too-short living-room sofa . Here it begins with Miss Farrow and Dustin Hoffman waking up in the same bed , in the morning , naked , ? after a meeting the night before in an East Side " singles " pub . But it 's the same old idea : the couple who meet and get entangled before they know each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , it would have been better as a thirties film because flirting , instead of frankness , is better suited to this cutesy story . ( And it would have eliminated the gratingly coarse dialogue given to a friend of Hoffman 's . ) Miss Farrow substantiates Jones 's worry . She has been very good in some neurotic roles ? in Secret Ceremony and in Rosemary 's Baby ; but where she is supposed to have charm , and where that charm is supposed to come from physical appeal , the result is dubious . Whoever is managing Dustin Hoffman has chosen well for him . A light hip lover is a good change after Midnight Cowboy , which was a good change after The Graduate ? and is especially good before his next appearance in the film of Thomas Berger 's splendid novel , Little Big Man . Those who saw Hoff-man 's last theater appearance in Jimmy Shine or who saw him as the brash young cockney in Eh ? will be less astonished at his versatility here but no less admiring . In terms of building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , this film was a good choice for Hoffman . Peter Yates 's direction of Bunt was an amalgam of various TV private-eye styles . Here his opening shot reminded me of the opening of Hitchcock 's Mr. and Mrs. Smith ; after that , he seemed less certain about whom to imitate . Bert Lahr spent most of his career in the theater . It 's especially significant , then , that the title of his biography refers to one of his relatively few film roles . ( A social comment in itself . ) And it gives me a chance to discuss Notes on a Cowardly Lion in a film column . John Lahr had the good luck to be his father 's son , something that many thousands of us keenly envy him . The outstanding quality of his book is that he appreciates his luck : his affection for his father is immediately clear , and it glows throughout the nearly four hundred ( big ) pages . Also , John Lahr is aware ? though on a modest level of perception ? of the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were manifested in the theater . Bert Lahr , born in New York of German-Jewish parents in 1895 , broke into show business in 1910 when burlesque and vaudeville were bubbling and constantly demanded new materials . As the author says , it was a seller 's market . When the comedian began , he used a " station-house " German accent and frequently played in schoolroom sketches , in which various accents were used ? a direct response to the experience of the immigrant audiences . Toward the end of his life , Bert Lahr was in the first US production of Waiting for Godot . En route he encountered films and , as they were invented , radio and television . His career was a distillation of change . His son is somewhat overimpressed by the contrast between the public clown and the private worrier . Pagliac-ci aside , this contrast is a common-place of the theater . One of the oldest theater jokes is about the great clown Grimaldi . A man goes to a doctor be-cause he feels depressed . The doctor examines him and says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . You just need cheering up . Go to see Grimaldi . " The patient says , " But , doctor , I am Grimaldi . " John Lahr 's closeness and concern have produced a certain na ? vet ? in him on this point ? not For reporting the truth but For los-ing perspective on it . ( I mean the perennial worries of the clown . His father 's early marital trouble is a different , terrible story . ) He does well in two regards . He shows the evolution both of his father 's ambitions and his changes in style ? from knockabout clown to comic commentator . And he underscores the sheer theatrical instinct that enabled Bert Lahr to recognize quality even in the strange . When the comedian read the screenplay of The Wizard of Oz , a relatively daring undertaking in its day , he thought it was beautiful and wanted to do it . Much more extraordinary , when he read Waiting for Godot ? long before the critics had kosherized Beckett he responded with a fine performer 's instincts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks to his agent after reading Godot and says : " It 's not like anything that 's been done . . . Yes , but it 's funny . . . I know , Lester , I know it 's supposed to be tragic , but there are lots of gags . . . I 'm not sure , but the writer 's no phony . How many weeks do you think I could get with it ? " Affection , information , color ? the book has plenty of them . Nevertheless , the reader has to fight to finish it because it is so very badly written . The net impression is that the author is afraid of the English language , is sweating clammily as he wrestles with it , and loses . There is neither space nor reason to document the struggle completely , but here are some fair samples . Stuff-and-stuffing . On the day of Bert Lahr 's birth , his father goes up on the roof to read his newspaper . " Jacob felt comfortable in the summer air . To the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Etc . Corn . " DeSylva combined the discipline of a writer with a sense of phrase and romance that made his songs as scintillating as the decade in which they were written . " Or : " To the world , Lahr was a success ; privately , the specter of failure haunted him . " Malapropisms . " Ziegfeld was cut from a more cosmopolitan mold . " ( " Cast in " a mold , perhaps ? ) When Mrs. Lahr calls up to her husband 's dressing-room : " A falsetto voice echoes up the stairwell . " ( A " female " voice ? ) Wretched writing . Just one sample out of dozens . " Later , smaller-scale revues ... found admiring audiences on Broadway by offering not only more acerbic satire , but also an economic format that counterbalanced spiraling Broadway costs . " Aside from the fact that spirals can go either up or down , this sentence says that audiences admired these new shows not only because the satire was harsher but because producers invested less money in them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his acknowledgments , the author thanks his publishing-house 's president , editor , and copy-editor . What for ? In the rather special field of filial theater-biography , Notes is not remotely as accomplished a piece of work as Daphne du Maurier 's Gerald or Frances Donaldson 's Freddy ( the life of Frederick Lonsdale ) . But if the reader grits his teeth and bears with John Lahr 's barbarisms and banalities , the boisterous , sad warmth of Bert Lahr will come through .
