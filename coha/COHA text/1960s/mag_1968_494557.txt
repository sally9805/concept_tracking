DECEMBER 7 , 1968 The Private LSandburg by Peter Michelson There may be another Sandburg . But he wo n't be found in these letters , which document the hallowed Sand-burg , the librettist of The Mob and high priest of populist democracy . He The Letters of Carl Sandburg Herbert Mitgang , Editor ( Harcourt , Brace &; World ; $12.50 ) emerges from them as he does from all his work - compassionate , sentimental , large-souled , reverent . For these qualities we have honored him , and the " beloved Sandburg " has a permanent British Fascist movement . He had thought of himself as the Roosevelt of the British crisis and if he had been given his head , he might well have been as great a figure as Roosevelt . He failed , and one still wonders why . Was he arrogant ? Yes . Was he impatient ? Undoubtedly . Did he understand democracy ? No . Was he spoiled ? Of course . He did not go to Eton . He was never at Oxford or Cambridge . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cornered and exterminated . And for all Sir Oswald 's present boasting , this is what happened to him a long , long time ago . He is not a contemporary figure , he is a curiosity . To have so much talent and to throw it so recklessly away - is this not a Shakespearean tragedy ? Sir Oswald 's sins are manifest . Yet was his guilt and blindness worse than Ramsay Macdonald 's , who presided over England 's decline ? Was it worse than Baldwin 's who , through laziness , failed to rearm Britain when Hitler came to power ? Was he worse than Chamberlain , who was prepared to make a deal with Hitler ? History will take care of these questions . Mosley may be worth only a footnote , and yet his failure in a way illuminates the muddle and tragedy that led up to the Second World War . He began by being a man of goodwill , determined to transform a moribund society . He ended as a hateful , hating man who has no excuse for his behavior , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a principal celebrant of the American myth . Because of the modern perversity to look For depths as well as heights in our heroes , it is disconcerting to find that the private Sandburg of the letters ( at least this " arrangement " of them ) is as Olympian as the public man . It is this sublime opacity that makes him so equivocal a figure in American letters . While his Lincoln biographies may be monumental , his poetry remains minor . Somehow the Sandburg imagination serves better to illuminate the past or provide an allegorical faith THE NEW REPUBLIC in the future than it does to help us engage , as poetry must , our present . And for those who have come to consciousness since Hiroshima and Nagasaki , the present has been so cataclysmic and morally ambiguous , that his sanguine poetic view of the future seems to them effete . Nevertheless , as The People , we love him because his teleological democratic dream ennobles us , gives us collective drama and grandeur , attributes vision and destiny to our myopic daily routine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beat me and hammer me into a crowbar. / Let me pry loose old walls . / Let me lift and loosen old foundations . " Fine progressive sentiments , but beneath every Worker 's coverall bib lurks the psyche of a man , thumping to a complexity of desires and frustrations untouched by Sandburg 's rhapsody . His poetic imagination is so completely at the mercy of the American myth , so absorbed with The People as a sentimental abstraction , that he can not plumb those psychic troughs that determine personality and human unique- . . , , . l ness . Nor has he much sympathy with those who did . This , for instance , is his response to Byron : " Time ? Byron called it the tomb-builder ? but Byron never knew anything but the pleasure of being sad . If he could have hoed potatoes and built wood sheds part of his time , he would have dashed down yon Samian cup of sweet melancholy . " So many slabs of the sun-burnt west for a club-footed aristocrat 's archetypal darkness . Sandburg 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? is suffused in his serene , panoramic , historical optimism . Private reality is an aberration in his high-flown world view . No man 's death diminishes him , while every child 's birth enriches him . He is The People . Democracy is therefore an article of faith with him . He was aware of a gap between language and actuality : " ' Democracy , " popular government , " the republican form of government , " republican rule , ' ' vox populi , " We , the people , ' these are all word usages never yet adequately defined . True democracy is as difficult and as mystic in its operations as true religion or true art . . . the masses of people have gone wrong often in the past and will again in the future ? but in the main their direction is right . " But he continued nevertheless to invoke the word as if it were the thing . Adoring slang as he did , phrasemaking came naturally to him . And democracy being a religion for him , he just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his few letters to poets or about poetry , he acknowledged to Amy Lowell in 1917 that , " Glancing over some old and genuinely propaganda material of mine of ten years ago , I got a sneaking suspicion that maybe you 're right and maybe I have struck a propaganda rather than a human note at times . " For Sandburg , as for Plato , Democracy was so beautiful a song ? so tempting yet so far , like a " star on the horizon rim " ? that it was necessary to ignore those frequently sour human notes in order to affirm its gossamer reality . Eliot knew how vulnerable dreams were to human voices , and like most modern poets he knew the need for drowning . But not Sandburg . Ironically his dream is untouchably transcendental . In spite of himself he continues his rhetorical incantations , obscuring the complex and contradictory nature of actual democracy in order to preserve the comforting coherence and beauty of its song . " I do n't , " he wrote in 1904 when he was an organizer for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pathetic , and the execrable as one must do in socialist propaganda . . . . " But he found it necessary . One wonders what his poetry might have been if he had seen the " human note " necessary to propaganda as equally necessary to vital poetry . The question is not whether propaganda can be poetry ; it is rather what audience one wishes to address . Sandburg wrote poetry for the same audience to which he preached , and produced consequently a kind of idealized ( or sentimentalized ) propaganda . in 1912 this was fine both for Sandburg and poetry . But when poetry kept growing , Sand-burg did n't . Frost 's famous epithet ? that he avoided being a radical in his youth for fear of being conservative in his old age ? is a prophetic description of what happened to Sandburg . He is to American poetry what HHH is to our politics . Their humane sentiments have become so subsumed in sentimental rhetoric , that the reality of their values is dissipated . How else can one understand Sandburg , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of congressional kewpie doll in the 196o 's ? Here is the fire-eater of 1904 : " There is some splendid blood in the Socialist party , and they are such reckless zealots , that I feel that whether I ever get even a dim glimpse of a co-operative commonwealth , I shall certainly witness some grand assaults on capitalism , and as sure as our blood is red , there will be a recession of some sort from the present arrogance , and bland , easy assumption of the powers that be . . . I used to think there was a tinge of the sardonic in the socialist , but it seems now to be only the twisted smile of a Gilliat as he opens his knife and calculates for the eye of the devilfish . These people who talk of snipping off bits of the tentacles ! " But by 1959 he had come to agreeable THE NEW REPUBLIC enough terms with the arrogant capitalistic devilfish that he could croon Lincoln-glory ? more rhetoric , more of the past he himself had called " a bucket of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress . He was by this time , of course , an old man , and a much honored national figure . But that 's the point . The " powers that be " did n't fear him . He had become predictable , was safe because he could be counted on to address a level of democratic generality so chaste that nobody , from Strom Thurmond to Martin Luther King , would either take exception or be threatened by it . For all the rampant sentimentality that we necessarily distrust , however , there is a magnitude in the Sandburg personality that goes beyond both his work and his public image . America needed a poet to love her uncritically and in a language she could understand . Once she found him , she used him indefatigably . At his best , Sand-burg is the authentic humanist . Some of the vintage Sandburg is in these letters . They contain a kind of freedom and incisiveness that makes them , when good , very , very good . There is no dark psyche or secret life revealed . The others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected ; that the public Sandburg is not appreciably augmented by the private one . Erich Fromm 's new book is at once a critique of society and a program for its humanization , a combination of manifesto and exhortation . At the beginning we are warned that " a specter is stalking in our midst " ? that of a completely mechanized society ? and at the end we are encouraged to hope , for " there is a real possibility that man can reassert himself , and that he can make the technological society human . " Fromm 's radicalism has roots in the early writings of Karl Marx ? the Marx of the 1844 Manuscripts , rather than Capital ? and this is the key to his special kind of humanism . Fromm 's critical thesis is similar to Marx 's , if not identical in content . Our society is structured , he says , so that persons in it are not only unhappy or discouraged , but are diminished as persons , morally and psychologically ; it is doubtful whether they are , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows the institution of private property disengages man 's essence ( his laboring function ) From him , placing it beyond his control , thereby rendering him something less than a person . According to Fromm , our technological society , by unwittingly permitting the pervasive development of mechanistic categories of thought , risks a similar loss of human essence ? though the essence at stake is our capacity for " humane experience , " rather than , as for Marx , a single albeit internally complex function . By humane experiences Fromm means tenderness , compassion , empathy , responsibility , identity , integrity , and hope . Humanism of this kind presupposes an account of the " nature of man . " If Fromm is right about this nature , and if in fact our society displaces this nature from us , then the reform of society is not merely a matter of improving our social lot , but of restoring ourselves , i.e. re-establishing our status as men . Fromm believes that the realization of this new society would require : ( a ) the humanization of centralized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ z ) the " activation " of individuals , i.e. the securing of their full participation in all social decisions that affect their work , conduct , and well-being , ( 3 ) the reorganization of patterns of consumption so that people have the capacity and energy to enjoy humane experiences , and ( 4 ) the renewal of a " psychospiritual " affirmation of humanistic values . This list may seem platitudinous . The question is how it may all be brought about . Fromm 's answer is a plea for participatory institutions , plus a tentative proposal on how this might be structured . His discussion of participatory institutions and how they might be set up is instructive . He writes that " the ideas of activation , responsibility , participation ? that is , of the humanization of technological society ? can find full expression only in a movement which is not bureaucratic , not connected with the political machines , and which is the result of active and imaginative efforts of those who share the same aims . " The major goal of such a movement would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new society , in the very process of bringing it into existence . The movement would be a loosely organized set of groups attempting to come to grips with the social , political , and cultural problems that bear upon their lives . Their medium would be close discussion that takes as its point of departure facts and a will to understand ideas , rather than an espousal of ideologies .. There is more to this than monthly Great Books meetings . Fromm has in mind a hierarchical national " Council " ( " which could be called the ' Voice of American Conscience ' " ) , made up of some 40 or 5o prominent men of known integrity and achievement , local Councils similarly constituted , local " Clubs " of some zoo to 300 members , and much smaller " Groups " of , say , 25 members . Roughly , the national Council would deal with foreign policy and domestic issues of national import , while the local Councils would be concerned with major state and community problems . The members of Clubs are " to relate @
