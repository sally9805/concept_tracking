" The first call for the right of negotiation belongs to Kansas City , " said Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick . <P> " Robert James Monday , " responded the Athletics ' Farm Director Hank Peters , " outfielder from Santa Monica , Calif. , a sophomore at Arizona State University in Tempe . " <P> And so it began last week in Manhattan 's Commodore Hotel-baseball 's first " free agent " draft , which , in effect , stripped away the bargaining rights of the country 's young hopefuls and put them on the block like so many sides of beef . To hear some of the clubs talk , it was the greatest boon to baseball since Happy Chandler returned to politics . " I 've been pushing for this thing for 20 years , " crowed the Cleveland Indians ' vice president , Gabe Paul . <P> Under the new ground rules , no ballplayer can play one $100,000 bonus offer against another . When a player is drafted , the team choosing him has exclusive rights to negotiate with him for six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wants . If the player says no , back he goes into the pool , and comes up for the next draft-an older and presumably wiser man . Unlike the pro football draft , where a player retains some competitive bargaining power through rival leagues , he can either like it or lump it . And where a pro football player can play out a year 's option and then be free to deal for himself , the baseball draft could theoretically bind a player to one team for life . <P> Understandably , many of the richest teams see the draft as a threat to their power . No longer will such moneybags as the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers be able to sew up the brightest prospects . The last-place team each year gets first crack , and so on up the line . Yankee Vice President John Johnson called it " immoral " - though the seventh-place Yanks had better watch their language . <P> The draftees themselves were silent - even Arizona State 's " Rick " Monday , who had better cause to wail than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him $100,000 to sign . But Rick is only 19 , and his season average was .396 , with nine homers and 45 RBIs in 48 games this spring . That would have been worth at least $200,000 in the good old days . However , if the draft seems too cold , there is always the Peace Corps.
