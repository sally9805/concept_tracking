Mr. Salaff received his Ph D. in applied mathematics from the University of California in 1966 . Since then , lie has been a Visiting Lecturer in Mathematics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and has contributed articles on Japan , Okinawa and Hong Kong to the Far Eastern Economic Review . Hong Kong Hong Kong is now enjoying an economic boom , and Britain is confident enough in its future stability to have guaranteed credit for a cross-harbor tunnel linking the island for which the colony is named with the Kowloon peninsula . China has quietly offered , in the South China Morning Post ( April 18 ) , to supply its Five Rams brand of portland cement at a competitive price for the tunnel . Another multimillion-dollar expansion project for which local developers are trying to get funds is the extension of the airport runway to handle the jumbo jet ; several new tourist hotels are already being built to accommodate the extra crowds of tourists which the jumbos will carry . The builders of the tunnel will be careful not to obstruct the warships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural harbor from maneuvers in Korean and Southeast Asian waters , and from combat posts off Vietnam These ships have for years been dropping anchor at the rate of thirty to forty a month . In addition , military and commercial planes bring troops daily from Saigon and Danang . The American servicemen arrive in Hong Kong for six days of rest and recreation ( R &R); and the commercially oriented colony welcomes them because tourism is its second industry , and , according to Hong Kong Government figures , two out of seven tourists now arriving are R &R; men . Each of them spends on the average $350 , and the 220,000 troops who visited here in 1968 thus shelled out more than $77 million , one-third of Hong Kong 's total tourist income . Time ( May 31. 1968 ) estimated Hong Kong 's R &R; windfall to be $100 million a year There are two conflicting views of Hong Kong in the British Establishment . One , according to the Far Eastern Economic Review , sees it as " an embarrassing colonial anachronism hung around the unwilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The other , that of " businessmen and manufacturers with a solid stake in the colony 's future , " looks upon it as a " challenge " calling for imagination and resourcefulness , so that " Hong Kong can play a role in the future of the Chinese people . " The factions agree , however , that the colony must continue to run on its traditional laissez-faire economic basis , supporting its own population without substantial corporation taxes and without help from London . And the second group is only a little behind the first in its determination to make as many fast bucks as possible , in particular by wide-armed greeting for R &R.; But Hong Kong depends also on the People 's Republic of China for half of its foodstuffs , much of its clothing and household staples , and part of its critical water supply . Reciprocally , Chinese goods are sold at rock-bottom prices in the Hong Kong " China Products " stores and from these abundant sales and re-exports through Hong Kong to Southeast Asia and beyond , China derives fully half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their families and clansmen reach the mainland via the Hong Kong branch of the Bank of China . Peking also uses the colony as the mainland entry point for the thousands of Japanese , German and other businessmen who attend the Trade Fairs in Canton , nearby capital of Kwangtung Province . Thus Hong Kong 's position as a tax-free poll Contains economic advantages for both China and the capitalists of the West , and on the shrewd guess that China will not call a halt for some time to come , investors from the NATO countries and Japan , and from among overseas Chinese , are putting large sums into tourism , transport and industry . Hong Kong 's sister colony of Macao , whose continued existence under the Portuguese flag is a symbolic blow to the freedom fighters trying to exorcise the Lusitanian bogy on the African continent  --  is experiencing a similar growth . That is also a sign to investors that China does not intend to change the status quo . China 's policy toward Hong Kong and Macao is related to its primary foreign policy demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Taiwan 410 Strait and acknowledge that Taiwan is a part of China . Officials and analysts feel that the present territorial position in Hong Kong and Macao will last at least until the Taiwan problem is resolved in a way satisfactory to Peking . The benefits which R &R; in the meantime bring to Hong Kong caused one leading U.S. consular official there to predict : " Communist China wo n't break its rice howl in Hong Kong by throwing the Fleet out of here . " It is of course quite possible that if the British had been unable in May 1967 to suppress the uprising that attempted to alter the internal power balance , the Hong Kong patriotic Chinese ( a designation followers of the CPR prefer to " Communist , " which they never use ) would have begun strongly to oppose the R &R; program . But everyone now seems prepared to forget the strikes and police suppression , and the revenge bombings which followed , and the pro-mainland sector is trying to rebuild its own financial and commercial machine . It is allowed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mao Tse-tung in patriotic schools , but the police come down hard on anti-Hong Kong Government activities and demonstrations . The patriotic press opposes R &R,; but the one feature story on the subject it has printed so far this year did not mention the war in Vietnam . It was an attack on " Western ways " among the youth  --  the corrupt Pop music and dancing culture , and the Anglo-Chinese schools , which have duped " 70 per cent of Hong Kong 's approximately 12.000 bar girls " into the trade by providing them with a debilitating " slave " education . Chinese patriots sometimes rationalize the R &R; program as just one in a long string of indignities perpetuated by foreigners at the southern gate of China . Given this historical outlook and the CPR 's line on Taiwan , one can perhaps understand why Peking 's " serious warnings " on U.S. intrusions into Chinese sea and air space and its protests to the United States in Warsaw about the occupation of Taiwan arc regarded as reasonable and sufficient opposition to American military exploitation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help their Vietnamese comrades , Chinese patriots arc glad to sell Mao buttons and quotations to American sailors visiting Hong Kong from the war zone , but the rank and file , well disciplined and under the tight control of mainland and mainland-trained cadres , is instructed not to make anti-imperialist propaganda among the U.S. troops . The leadership knows that if anti-war leaflets were distributed to the visitors , sonic of them would inevitably insult China , and fights would break out . This would spoil the present mood of profitable amity . Thus there are no anti-Vietnamese War demonstrations in Hong Kong , and no resistance organizations like Japan 's Beheiren to incite and aid dissenting servicemen into deserting . Wanchai , located near the island 's Central District , is the huh of the R &R; Circuit . It is a typical Chinese quarter , packed with small shops , peddlers , schools and street restaurants for the residents . Sailor bars , R &R; tailor shops and piZza houses are thoroughly intermixed with the normal Chinese street life . The frustrated , vulnerable sailors who roam Wanchai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but are ignored by as many coolies who hurry past carrying heavy loads on THE NATION/ October 20 , 1969 their shoulder poles . The American sailors and the Chinese population are far apart culturally , but the Chinese are patient and acquisitive With shore patrols and military police sitting on the whole area the open clashes which might be expected in such an incongruous situation have not occurred . Wanohai is also one of the patriotic strongholds , and the movement 's newspapers , department stores , schools and union offices are to be found on every large street But the patriotic Chinese have boxed themselves off politically trom the servicemen , and often a left-wing union office peacefully occupies the upper floor of a building that houses a sailor bar on the street level . It pays for Britain to profess that the R &R; program is militarily trivial and that , in any case . if the U S. troops were forced to leave Hong Kong they would simply " go somewhere else " Harold Wilson has managed with this argument to divert the London anti-war demonstrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rebuttal is obvious To the U S military command , which must offer its w arriors a chance to soothe their pains and cares , R &R; in Hong Kong has a straightforward military function which can not easily be spread around to other ports As the Hanoi Vietnam Courier put it on February 3- " The gigantic military apparatus of the USA possesses enormous means supposedly capable , if not of inflating chockablock the morale of the GIs. at least of preventing such a rapid sinking as we have witnessed . Substantial material privileges have been granted to those in Vietnam pay hike , rest and recreation in reputed and most attractive cities in the Far East and the Pacific including Hong Kong , Bangkok , Singapore , Manila , Taipei , Honolulu , Yokosuka , etc " The annual number of R &R; arrivals In most of the cities on Hanoi 's list is less than Hong Kong 's 220.000. and with massive Japanese antiwar protests to climax in 1970 , and clearly discernible centrifugal tendencies in SEATO lands , not many of themcould support a big increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locating play space for the men is the problem of finding ports for the ships to which they are attached . All of the Seventh Fleet 's powerhouse types  --  carriers , cruisers and nuclear subs  --  call on Hong Kong for the R &R; visits of their crews . The Enterprise , the world 's largest warship , with more than 5,000 men . arrived in May 1968 for its third visit , and many of the Fleet 's other nuclear-powered carriers have been to Hong Kong . The same nuclear subs which cause violent mass protests on the Japan mainland and in Okinawa because of the radioactivity they are alleged to impart to the local waters , often tie up at buoy number A 11 on Hong Kong harbor 's central fairway. without even the possibility that contamination will be mentioned publicly in the colony The freedom to bring in the whole range of nuclear-powered vessels is a special advantage afforded by Hong Kong , and if the composition of the American military force in Asia shifts further toward the " seaborne nuclear deterrent . " ' the Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hong Kong . Last August , Donald Stone , vice chairman of SNCC , was asked to address a mass rally in Naha , Okinawa . He encouraged the people under U S. military occupation there to persist in their efforts to rid themselves of the huge American base , no matter how many dollars it has been pumping into their sadly depressed economy . It would " make whores of your women , pimps of your men , and it will seduce your souls Once you begin to flirt with American dollarism you are lost . It will in the end mean the death of all that is beautiful , vibrant and alive in you . " Stone 's eloquent plea to the Okinawans would strike home to many of those British and Chinese who have been taking R &R; blood money in Hong Kong . But it will not trouble their hearts in the night , because it could not be printed today in any newspaper in the Crown colony .                   @ @
