As long as any Dutchmen can remember , the airspace over their crowded lowlands has swarmed with birds . But the birds have increasing competition . Part of the sky over The Netherlands has been invaded by commercial air routes ; another part has been taken over by the military . And the birds are fighting back . In the past seven years the Dutch Air Force has recorded 413 bird-plane collisions . Commercial airplanes have had their share of bird trouble too , but they make no reports lest they frighten passengers . Circumstances have forced the Dutch to become world leaders in anti-bird research , but the problem is serious in many other places , and it tends to get worse . <P> At jet speeds a bird 's soft body becomes a hard projectile that can easily whack a hole in the edge of a wing ; jet engines suck up birds like giant vacuum cleaners and suffer serious internal damage . One Dutch military pilot was almost killed when his jet inhaled five gulls on take-off and crashed into a barrier . Another crashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25% of Dutch military aircraft was out of action because of bird trouble . <P> Distressed Dialect . To the rescue came " The Birdman of The Hague , " Zoologist Johann D. F. Hardenberg of the Ministry of Agriculture 's fauna department . Called in by the Air Force and Amsterdam 's airport , Hardenberg 's first move was to import an American invention , a loudspeaker playing the tape-recorded distress calls of American herring gulls . It was an imaginative effort , but it did not work . Dutch herring gulls apparently speak a dialect all their own and are not alarmed by the screams of their American cousins . When Dr. Hardenberg recorded distressed Dutch gulls and a Jeep carrying his loudspeaker patrolled the runway of Leeuwarden military air base , the gulls merely flew up ahead of the noise in temporary terror and then landed behind it . Dr. Hardenberg 's riposte was to line the runway with 23 loudspeakers , which sounded off with ghastly screams that kept the gulls 500 ft. away . <P> By 1966 , ten air force bases will use this system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever bird is causing trouble . Nearly all birds , says Hardenberg , are frightened away by their own distress calls . Only ducks do n't seem to care , and magpies are actually attracted to the loudspeakers . <P> Frightening Racket . Commercial airports do not use the full Hardenberg system . When birds get thick along a runway , a Jeep broadcasting the appropriate distress calls drives out to clear the way so the jetliners can take off safely . There are no permanent loudspeakers to make a racket that scares away nervous passengers as well as birds . <P> Since Dr. Hardenberg started his work , bird accidents at Dutch airports have sharply decreased ; but in-flight accidents have increased sharply and for no apparent reason . Most of them occur in spring or fall when birds are migrating , but some birds congregate dangerously at other times . Coping with migratory birds , says Hardenberg , calls for close cooperation between aviation experts and ornithologists . Pilots should get bird information along with weather forecasts , he says , and the movements of birds should be followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see whether radar can watch for dangerous birds as it does for thunderstorms .
