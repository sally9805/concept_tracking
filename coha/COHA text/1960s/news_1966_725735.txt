txt Long Island Sound can be dammed to create the largest fresh water reservoir in the United States , according to a plan proposed by a Columbia University oceanographer . The proposal , outlined in the issue of Science published today , was made in light of the " serious water shortage in parts of the United States and the prospect of enlarged future water needs . " The proposal is also in response to a plea from a Federal water resources committee for " far-out ideas " to increase the nation 's water supply . Unlike the Ancient Mariner , who merely lamented , " Water , water , everywhere , Nor any drop to drink , " the oceanographer , Dr. Robert D. Gerard of Columbia 's Lamont Geological Laboratory , went to work on a relatively sim- ple means of capturing and desalinating one of the largest potential reservoirs in the area . He figured out that one bridge-dam in the vicinity of the Whitestone Bridge and another spanning the eastern end of the Sound  --  from about 5 miles east of the Connecticut River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 trillion gallons of water . Within seven and a half years  --  or perhaps a bit more ? fresh water from the Housatonic and Connecticut Rivers , streams , ground water and precipitation will have " pushed out " enough salt water to make the Sound drinkable , Dr. Gerard said . The exact time that would be required depends on how well the fresh and salt water would be mixed ; Dr. Gerard , explained . Since salt water is heavier than fresh water , it tends to form a layer beneath fresh water . Such stratification means it would take longer for the salt water to wash over the dam into the ocean on one end and the East River on the other . Once the reservoir is established , Dr. Gerard said , it could , supply up to 12 times the amount of water normally required each day by New York City . This would allow New York to divert and sell to other areas water it now brings through deep rock tunnels from over 100 miles away , the scientist suggested . Could Aid South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities whose wells are being threatened by salt water encroachment , Dr. Gerard pointed out . " One of the major problems in the proposed scheme is the control of pollution in this heavily populated and industrialized area , " he noted . He offered a solution , but said he " assumes for the purposes of the present report that control can be achieved through Federal , State and local efforts over the next decade and that maintaining potable drinkable water in the proposed reservoir is a realistic goal . " To solve the shipping problem that would result from damming the Sound , Dr. Gerard suggested constructing sealevel locks in the dams . He pointed out that shipping traffic on the Sound ? mostly shal1 low-draft barges ? " presents no problem to a modern lock system . " He further noted that " although present fishing and shellfish industries would be discontinued , the prospects of commercial and sport fishing activity , free from pollution , is , an attractive alternative . " Dr. Gerard expects monetary gains as well as water revenues to be derived from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two dams would produce a gross revenue estimated at $40-million per year . " He also suggested that New York City might save from $50-million to $100-million " by avoiding installation cf water meters , suggested during the present xvn ter shortage . " He sees benah.s Lo yachtsmen , " including reduction of corrosion , perpetual . high tide and the absence of tidal currents . " The proposed bridge-dam across the eastern end of the Sound would be 7.7 miles long ? " twice the length of Fort Peck Dam on the Missouri River at present the longest in the United States but shorter than two Russian dams , " Dr. Gerard explained . Thus , it " compares favorably " with other similar projects , he added . And it would serve an additional purpose  --  that of connecting the New England Thruway system with . Long Island expressways . Reaction in this area to the proposal ranged from reserved to unfavorable . Opposition in Westchester In White Plains , George J. Natt , director of the Westchester County water agency , said the use of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dams would be prohibitive . " Anyway , " he commented , " I do n't believe enough fresh water flows into the sound to keep it filled  --  especially in the drought years . The communities along the sound in Westchester and Connecticut divert most of the fresh water into present reservoirs and the little water reaching the Sound often is polluted . " The water would need " extraordinary purification " before it could be pumped into pipe lines , " he declared . Opinion was withheld at the Department of Water Supply , Gas and Electricity here . Acting Water Commissioner Robert D. Clark said he had read the Gerard proposal and had referred it to Acting Chief Engineer Abraham Groopman of the Bureau of Water Supply and his associates . " We wo n't comment until we 've had time to evaluate the suggestion , " Mr. *Clark explained . William S. Wise , director of Connecticut 's Water Resources Commission , laughingly said in New Haven that " a lot of good ideas have seemed as preposterous as this one at first ; I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has written . " It was his offhand opinion , Mr. Wise said , that the Gerard proposal was " not practical , " but he would have to study it before condemning it . He predicted that the idea would encounter opposition from " bathers who like to swim . in salt water and from Connecticut 's substantial salt water fishing industry . " I In Mineola , Arthur Kunz , chief planner for the Nassau , Planning Commission , said he was not " overly enthusiastic " about the proposal for the Long Island Sound Reservoir . " The idea is not a new one , " Mr. Kunz asserted , " I first heard of it a year and a half ago . " The idea has a lot of limitations , " he went on . " Damming Long Island Sound would be fantastically expensive , even though it would have the ad , vantage of supplying us with a new source of water . " Suffolk County Executive H. Lee Dennison in Riverhead ridiIculed the Gerard water proposal . " I 'm a professional engineer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dennison declared . " We think big out here on Long Island , but this idea is a little far out . " Southold Town Supervisor Lester M. Albertson called the proposal " a bit overambitious. "
