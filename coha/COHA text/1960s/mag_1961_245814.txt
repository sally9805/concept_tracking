Combining Greek tragedy and judicial farce , a federal court jury last week re-enacted for a Baltimore television audience just how it had decided to convict a man of murder and kidnaping . <P> " An unprecedented public revelation of jury room activity , " crowed a handout by WBAL-TV , an NBC affiliate owned by the Hearst Corp . Raptured the Hearst-owned Baltimore News-Post : " A reportorial breakthrough of the traditional silence of the jury room . " It sure was . <P> The nine men , including the foreman - who later asserted that they had received assurances that their appearance had been okayed by federal authorities ( it was not ) - were seated around a long table at the WBAL studio . Also present ( offstage ) was a narrator who bridged awkward conversational gaps by making " clarifying " allusions for dramatic purposes of the hour-long taped show . The program was unsponsored , but the volunteer actors received $1 each for their ad-libbed efforts . " It was like a dream , " one said , " like walking into a room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station 's timing could not have been better-or worse-in airing the show . The verdict had been handed down on Feb. 23 , but the television version of their deliberations was beamed the day before Melvin Davis Rees Jr. , 32 , a Hyattsville , Md. , dance band musician , was to appear for sentencing for the crime that could bring him life imprisonment . Appearing before Judge Roszel C. Thomsen , Rees 's lawyers argued that the telecast had portrayed the jurors as discussing issues not raised in the trial , including the question of Rees 's sanity . " We do not know if the defendant 's rights were interfered with or not , " said Defense Attorney William J. O'Donnell . Judge Thomsen agreed and , pending a close look at the tape , put off sentencing indefinitely . <P> Rees 's crime was shocking-he was convicted in Maryland of murdering a mother and her five-year-old daughter ( in Virginia he is charged with killing the same family 's father and a one-and-a-half-year-old daughter ) . WBAL induced the jurors to enact The Verdict Is Ours after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the station that no permission was necessary from Judge Thomsen or anyone else . " If we had felt that it might influence the sentencing , we would n't have done it , " said Promotion Director Henry F. Hines . " We felt that what we were doing was in the public interest . This was to be an exciting and lasting tribute to the American jury system . " Exciting it was , but hardly a tribute .
