Does fallout from nuclear testing endanger the health of the world ? Last week only Soviet tests were spraying deadly fission products into the atmosphere , but 20-odd shots had been fired in only seven weeks , and from Japan to Norway , from Canada to India , fears and protests formed an anxious chorus . Statesmen and housewives asked scientists for reassurance . They got little : the scientists were worried too . <P> <P> &gt; Norwegian scientists predicted that in a few days the radiation level in Norway would pass the worst period of 1958 , when the U.S. and Britain were testing along with the Soviets . <P> &gt; Japan reported that rain falling on Oct. 14 on Wakkanai , Hokkaido , was 3,000 times as radioactive as rain analyzed before the Russians resumed testing . <P> &gt;The U.S. Public Health Service found that milk in New Orleans registered 530 micromicrocuries* of radioactive iodine per liter . In other Southern cities the level was nearly as high . <P> Deadly Balloon . No responsible authority believes that fallout from the Soviet tests is strong enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather and other uncertain factors can concentrate fallout to high local levels . And the worst is still to come : most of the dangerous radioactive products of the Soviet tests are still floating high in the stratosphere . No one can predict how much harm they will do when they eventually come down . <P> When a bomb in the megaton range explodes within a few hundred feet of the ground , as some of the Soviet tests presumably did , it produces three kinds of fallout : <P> <P> LOCAL FALLOUT . This is mostly the coarse , comparatively heavy material blasted out of the bomb crater . Although extremely dangerous , it spreads only a few hundred miles from the explosion . It does not get into the long-term circulation of the atmosphere , and it does not threaten the earth as a whole . <P> <P> After the bomb 's fireball has expanded to full size ( 1 miles diameter for a one-megaton bomb ) , the cloud of hot gas rises like a balloon , dragging with it a column of dust . Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming part of the local fallout . The rest climbs high in the atmosphere with the cooling , condensing cloud . <P> TROPOSPHERIC FALLOUT . In temperate latitudes , most of the dust , and part of the cloud , never gets higher than some 35,000 ft . This collection of nuclear fission products is the tropospheric fallout , and since the troposphere is the part of the earth 's atmosphere that contains rain clouds , even its finest particles of radioactive material are likely to be carried back to the ground by falling snowflakes or water droplets . <P> So far , most of the fallout from the current Soviet tests has been tropospheric . One of the radioactive air masses from the Russian Arctic test site rose into an air current that carried it from eastern Canada down the U.S. East Coast to Florida . Then it veered westward , along the Gulf Coast , dropping radioactivity that coated local pastures and showed up in the milk of grazing cows . Wandering clouds of tropospheric fallout from the Soviet tests have been detected over most of the Northern Hemisphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veering south across thickly populated parts of Russia while still in the first flush of their radioactivity.
