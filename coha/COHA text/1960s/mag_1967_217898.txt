Faceless , armless , toeless , sexless and potbellied , the figures could be store dummies , moon men , dolls , Oscars , or medical textbook diagrams . Ever since their creator , Sculptor Ernest Trova , 39 , presented them as " falling men " on rotating wheels and bolted six together into a giant humanoid child 's jack for a Famous-Barr department-store exhibition in St. Louis in 1964 , the debate has raged over what the little men mean . <P> In London , when Trova showed them , they were called by one critic " the cumulative image of Man as victim , stereotype , faceless statistic . " In Minneapolis , they typified , according to Curator Jan van der Marck , " the modern enigma . " Trova himself has said , " The falling man is a personal hypothetical theory on the nature of man . I believe that man is , first of all , an imperfect creature . " <P> Lost in a Maze . Now that his gleaming , chrome-plated figures stand on their own two feet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Museum of Modern Art put kaleidoscopes of Trova 's falling men on sale for $3.95 each , sold 8,000 in the past year ) , Trova is less concerned with the figures than with the sculptural environments in which he places them ( see color ) . " You might say I am a student of Aristotle , " explained the mustachioed Missourian in his suburban St. Louis studio last week . " Man has to deal with things around him . The environment is sometimes threatening , sometimes placid . " <P> In Maze , Trova says he meant the boxlike environment to be a " complicated " one . One figure is enclosed in a Plexiglas chamber , another figure is trying to get into one , while the third and fourth are lost among the partitions . <P> The Wheel Man , who looks out on Manhattan 's turbulent Fifth Avenue from the garden of the Guggenheim Museum , could be a symbol of the instability of man 's environment , as well as a study of motion itself . <P> Alien Atmosphere . The three-ton Venice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Museum , locates three 7-ft. - tall bronze monsters on a mechanistic version of a Giacometti plain sown with half-spheres , cylinders , 16 round holes and 16 matching pegs-a symbolic landscape , to Trova , of " the world today with its IBM machines . " Decorating his figures are gizmos from his large assortment of " found objects , " which he picks up in the antique shops around St. Louis ' Gaslight Square . A brace of oxygen tanks perches on the shoulders of the center figure , while a shower nozzle , stainless-steel tubing and a ski cable festoon the fronts of the other two . The apparatus eerily suggests scuba gear , gas masks , or an astronaut 's breathing equipment-items necessary , in Trova 's view , to habilitate man for " an alien atmosphere . "
