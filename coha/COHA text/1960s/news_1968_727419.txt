txt With Democrats and Republicans quarreling right up to the end , the second session of the 90th Congress adjourned today . The House adjourned at 2 P.M. and the Senate just 17 minutes later . Clearing the way for ad-. journment , House liberals abandoned their fight for legislation permitting televised debates by the three major Presidential candidates . ' the liberals had blocked adjournment last Friday and had threatened to hold out until the Senate acted on the " great debate " bill . In bowing to loud demands for adjournment , Representative James G. O'Hara , Democrat of Michigan , noted that Vice President Humphrey has now offered to pay for a threeway debate with opponents next Sunday night . Doubts on Acceptance Mr. O'Hara said , however , that he had little hope that the Democratic nominee 's offer would be accepted by Richard M. Nixon , the Republican nominee . " One can lead a warrior to battle , but you ca n't make him fight , " he said . Mr. Nixon hai said repeatedly that he would debate Mr. Humphrey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Independent party . Democratic efforts to force a debate among Mr. Humphrey , Mr. Nixon and Mr. Wallace , the three ' , f leading ' Presidential candidates , drew sharp rejoinders fion  --  Republicans . The House minority leader , Gerald R. Ford of Michigan , pointed out that Mr. Humphrey , when a Senator , and his running mate , Senator Edmund S. Muskie of Maine , had opposed similar legislation that would have cleared the way for a debate between President Johnson and his Republican oppo // nent , Barry Goldwater , in the campaign four years ago . " If it 's obstructionism on our part now , it was obstructionism on their part then , " Mr. , Ford said caustically . The House liberals had been seeking to force the Senate to act on a House-passed bill opening the way for three-way ' debates . The bill would have ) permitted the networks to offer free broadcast time to the three candidates without making the ' networks liable to claims for equal time by other candidates . ) Unless called back for a postelection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . The session just ended began on a cold day last January with anxious preoccupation over Vietnam , found its focus shifted homeward by the dollar crisis and civil disorder , and concluded on a politically partisan note . For nine months , Congress veered back and forth between social liberalism and fiscal conservatism , leaving behind a legislative record that was as contradictory as Congress 's often fickle mood . Some 700 bills were passed , many of them minor . But what was surprising for an , Administration that found its influ- ' ence constantly dwindling on Capitol Hill . was that few of the major bills requested by the White House were shelved . Congress passed landmark civil rights ? legislation assuring open housing for Negroes , but then cqt back on funds to provide housing for the . poor . It passed a tax increase , but then , when its own special interests were affected , it refused to cut spending . It was so perturbed over crime that it authorized largescale wiretapping by police anene ; es . But only reluctantly did it vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of criminals . Starting in January ; Congress was successively troubled by the Vietnam war , the dollar crisis , civil disorders arid finally by the imminence of elections . In various legislative acts , Congress reacted to each of these pressures , but what surprised the leadership was that the reaction was not more conservative , more partisan . In the nearly six-week session following the political party conventions , some of the pre-election partisanship flared up in an obstructive way , exactly as had been feared by a Democratic leadership that had already been losing its control over the members . Surprisingly , the partisanship was more pronounced in the Senate , where only 34 seats are up for election , than in the House , where all the members are up for re-election . Moie for partisan than policy reasons , the Senate was forced to lay aside the nuclear nonproliferation treaty when it was confronted with Republican opposition to immediate ratification . After a brief RepublicanSouthern Democratic filibuster , the nomination of Associate Justice Abe Fortes to be Chief Justice of the United States was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by President Johnson . Senate Republicans blocked consideration of legislation suspending the " equal time " provision in the communications law after it t became apparent that Richard M. Nixon , the Republican Presidential nominee , was not enthusiastic about participation in televisiori debates with his two adversaries . The " dollar crisis " influenced the thinking and coursekof the second ' session more than any other event  --  more than the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. , ensuing racial riots almost in the : backyard of the Capitol , the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy , the , withdrawal President Johnson asa candidate , the political conventions or the Presidential campaign , all of which left their impact . Shift of Attention One subtle effect of the " dollar crisis " was to nfute the Vietnam issue in Congress and to turn the attention . of Con-I gress inward to domestic problems , social as well asr fiscal . Without openly breaking with Administration ; Policy , conservatives began to , 3 ; ; question whether ** was worth the cost . In the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , paths with the liberals , ' who had long been concerned over the price that Vietnam was ex acting in domestic social , programs . The more obvious effect of the " dollar crisis " was to free the 10 per cent tax increase , long stalled in the House Ways and Means Committee . The price exacted by the Conservatives for the increase , ncrease , however , was a $6-billion reduction in planned spending in the current fiscal year . In the prevailing ? economy mood , Congress ' cut some $12-billion from the appropriations requests of the Administration . But when it came to actual spending ? as distinguished from appropriations , which are spent over a period of years Congress could cut only $3.5-billion . It was left to the Administration to find ways to meet the mandate of a $6-billion reduction . By the end of the session , Congress had introduced so many exemptions from the spending cut  --  such as those for rising farm price support costs or for Medicaid contributions  --  that the mandate had turned into a legislative sieve . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign aid program , which was given only $1.75-billion , the smallest amount in the 21-year history of the aid program and $1.2-billion less than requested by the Administration . Aside from the underlying ' economy motivation , the slash in the foreign aid program also reflected the growing Congressional ' retreat , in reaction to the Vietnam war , from foreign commitments . Also illustrative of this trend was the refusal to approve the Administration 's requests for contributions to the International Development Association and to the Asian Development Bank . Contrast on Housing The appropriations cuts also fell hard on the Defense Department , but most of the reductions were simply deferrals of military programs . In fact , the 90th Congress , by author- , izing deployment of the Sentinel missile defense system and by a series of reports warning about a strategic build-up by , the Soviet Union , probably laid the groundwork for a major expansion in military spending . Despite the prevailing economy need , Congress never turned completely conservative . It could still be liberal on au- , thorizing new domestic programs , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs . It authorized , for example , one of the most ambitious homing programs in history  --  a $5.3-billion , three-year program designed to provide 1.7 million new or rehabilitated housing units . But then it refused to grant all the money it had authorized to start a new pro- , gram of mortgage subsidies to l encourage home ownership and rental by low-income families. , More and more the bastion for the liberals became the Senate , which repeatedly rescued domestic programs from economy cuts by the House . It was the Senate , for example , that took the initiative , without any real encouragement from the Administration , in passing a civil rights law that for the first time imposes ' a Federal ban on discrimination In the sale and renting of housing . Some Gun Sales Banned The open housing law  --  a tribute to a small band of Senate liberals who waited out a southern filibuster ? was passed by the Senate before the death of Dr. King , and then in reaction to the assassination it was approved by the more conservative House . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events . to clear legislation that had seemed stalled . In a delayed reaction to the assassination of Senator Kennedy , for example , Congress finally overcame the resistance of the gun lobby and passed the first major gun control law in 30 years  --  a bill banning interstate mail order sales in rifles , shotguns and ammunition . In reaction to the public outcry over law and order , It passed a crime control bill that went far beyond the desires of the Justice Department , which increasingly found itself in disfavor on Capitol Hill . Following the Administration proposal , it authorized a program of Federal grants to states and communities to improve law enforcement . But then it went further by authorizing wiretapping against a broad variety of crimes and by seeking to overturn Supreme Court decisions on the admissibility of confessions . If the 90th deserves a footnote in history ; it is as a consumer - conservation - education Congress . In the field of education , it authorized a $7.3-billion , three-year extension of the program of Federal aid for higher education . Continuing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer-oriented bills , including legislation providing for poultry inspection , truthin-lending , gas pipeline safety , and protection against radiation from color television and other electronic devices . In the field of conservation , the second session established the Redwood National Park in California and the North ' Cascades Park in Washington ; created a nationwide system of trails and scenic rivers , and authorized the $1.3-billion central Arizona project .
