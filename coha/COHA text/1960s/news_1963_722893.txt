txt President Kennedy asked Congress today to recapture a fifth of his proposed 11 billion dollar tax cut for individuals by drastically limiting deductions for such things as mortgage interest and charitable contributions . A sweeping revision of the present scale of deductions was . the big surprise in a special message spelling out the President 's long awaited proposal for a three-step cut in individual income and corporate tax rates . The consensus in Congress seemed to be that some kind of tax cut would be enacted this year . nut all indications were that the President would get few of the revenue-boosting reforms he sought . In addition , a drive was opened to put a ceiling on federal spending . $300 Minimum Deduction Under the proposed revision in deductions , which also would apply to medical expenses and local taxes , only that part of the total outlays exceeding 5 per cent of a taxpayer 's income could be deducted . However , between 750,000 and 1,000,000 low-income taxpayers would pay no tax . For the first time everyone would get a minimum deduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100 for each dependent . Kennedy 's First Priority The program called for an over-all tax cut of 13.6 billion ? 11 billion for individuals and 2.6 billion for corporations . But the President proposed socalled reforms which would bring back to the treasury 3.4 billion , leaving a net reduction of 10.2 billion . Of the recaptured total , 2.3 billion would come from individuals . At his news conference today , Kennedy said the first priority of his administration is to get action from Congress on tax cuts this year . Kennedy said it was " very important " that Congress enact both tax cuts and tax reform . It would be unwise , he said , to pass tax cuts without approving the revenue-producing reforms . If the new revenue is n't produced , then the tax cuts will have to be reduced , he said . The first reduction in individual taxes would be retroactive to Jan. 1 this year . There would be additional cuts on Jan. 1 , 1964 , and Jan. 1 , 1965 . The proposed reforms on deductions would become effective on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Says The President said his threeyear program would provide an average 18 per cent tax cut for all taxpayers combined but that five out of six  --  most with incomes under $10,000 ? would get a reduction of more than 20 per cent . Kennedy 's plan would give a tax break to most persons over 65 , to many working mothers , and to athletes , actors , and others whose incomes fluctuate widely from year to year . There also was some good news for those having capital gains . Under the capital gains plan , profits from sales of securities , houses , and other properties would be taken at from 4.2 to 19.5 per cent instead of the present 10 to 25 per cent . But property would have to be held for a year instead of the present six months to qualify for the capital gains rate . Needs Spur , Not Bit On the other hand , the President proposed tougher tax treatment for the oil and gas industry , stock dividends , stock op , tions held by some corporation executives , and employes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said treasury calculations indicated that the President 's plan would give some tax relief to nearly everyone except a " handful " of individuals who operate almost entirely in oil and real estate . In laying his program before ' Congress , the President said the economy " is check-reined today by a war-born system at a time when it is far more in need of the spur than the bit . " He said it would reduce unemployment and increase production by an amount " several times as great as the tax cut itself . " Mistake to Cut Spending As for demands that he trim his record 98.8 billion budget with its 11.9 billion deficit , Kennedy said his spending program provided the minimum needed for national security and the Russian challenge in space . He said it would be a grave mistake to cut it . But Chairman Harry F. Byrd , D. , Va. , of the Senate finance committee and Sen. John J. Williams , R. , Del. , planned to introduce a resolution placing an annual spending limit on " every spending account in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficit financing . As the President revealed previously , his plan would reduce individual income tax rates in three annual steps from the present 20 .0,91 per cent to a new range of 14 to 65 per cent . New 14% Bracket As at present , the top rate would apply to income of more than $200,000 a year , or $400,000 for married couples filing jointly . At the bottom end of the scale , the President proposed a new 14 per cent bracket . It would apply to the first $1,000 of taxable income for single persons and the first $2,000 for married couples . The President said his program would mean that about 6.1 million of the 25 million taxpayers now itemizing their deductions would find it more  --  or equally  --  profitable to take the standard 10 per cent deduction and file a short return . Other major points in the pro-gram : Corporations ? Small firms would be favored by cutting the tax rate on the first $25,000 of corporate income to 22 per cent from 30 on 1963 income . The rate on earnings above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 47 per cent over a two-year period starting next Jan. 1 . Tax payments by corporations earning m ore than $100,000 a year would be speeded to put them on a current basis over a five-year period . $300 Deduction at 65 Individual withholding ? To reflect the lower tax rates on 1963 income , the withholding rate would be cut nearly 14 per cent on July 1 . Persons over ** present system of a double exemption ? $1,200 instead of $600 ? and the special retirement income credit would be abolished . Instead , each person 65 or older would deduct $300 from any taxes he might owe . Thus , no . one over 65 with earnings of $2,900 or less ? or $5,800 for married couples ? would pay any taxes . This would cut the tax yield from this source by $320 annually . Authors , athletes , actors ? the President said he had instructed secretary of the treasury Douglas Dillon to present to Congress as part of his tax program an " income averaging provision . " The income would be averaged over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million dollars a year , also would benefit some farmers , fishermen , atorneys , and architects . Depletion Allowance Stands Child care  --  A widowed mother or father now gets a special tax exemption of $600 to help offset the cost of child care . This would be raised to $900 if there are two children and to $1,000 for three children or more . Oil and , gas producers  --  Their tax boost was estimated at a total , 280 million a year . There would be no percentage change in the industry 's controversial 271/2 per cent depletion allowance . But rules governing income to which it applies would be changed . Other mineralproducing industries also would get a tax increase . Stock dividends  --  Such income would be taxed like wages , bringing an additional 460 million to the treasury . The President renewed his request that Congress repeal the right of investors to exclude from taxable the first $50 in dividends and to claim a tax saving equal to 4 per cent of the amount of other dividends .
