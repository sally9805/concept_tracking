Deep down in the " tank " - the maximum security room of the Joint Chiefs of Staff-some of the weary officers had not been to bed for 40 hours . Once again last week the Pentagon was under presidential orders to reassess the nation 's military might , a job that most Americans might take for granted is continually in progress . But this time the order from the White House carried a chilling call for immediate action : Find out in a couple of weeks how the armed forces can be beefed up to face the Berlin crisis that is expected in the fall or winter . <P> President Kennedy 's call for a reassessment was prompted by Khrushchev 's saber-rattling announcement a week ago that Russia was postponing its scheduled cut of 1,200,000 in military manpower and increasing its military budget by one-third . Prepared by the Joint Chiefs of Staff , this latest military review will pass under the eye of General Maxwell Taylor , the White House 's new military adviser , before it reaches President Kennedy . Its major purpose : to impress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Bracing for Brush Fires . The review will range across U.S. defensive power-from high-flying bombers to Navy troopships . But it will focus on U.S. capability of fighting a conventional war , the weapons and manpower that can be strengthened significantly in a few months ' time . Under consideration : calling six Army Reserve divisions and six National Guard divisions to active duty . <P> No one can seriously suggest that calling up a dozen Reserve divisions will make Khrushchev hesitate to make a grab for Berlin . But the Army wants to prepare as fast as it can for any brush fires the Russians may set around the rim of the Western world while U.S. attention is riveted on Germany . Rushing its readiness , the Defense Department last week announced that it will build up the Army full strength ( 870,000 ) by drafting 8,000 men in August , the largest draft call since last December . <P> Concern for Weapons . The Air Force , on the other hand , was concerned about weapons that will take years to get to the firing line : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on by the Red air force ( see THE WORLD ) , the U.S.A.F. was quick to suggest that the U.S. is falling behind the Russians in the production of manned military aircraft . Just five years ago , the Russians put on a similar show with similar results-a U.S. rush to produce more manned bombers . That time , the Russians were bluffing about their concern over building a bomber fleet ; despite the show , they were concentrating on the production of missiles , and they pulled ahead of the U.S. This time , the Air Force is convinced that Russia really is building new planes . Significantly , the Air Force 's new Chief of Staff is Gen. Curtis LeMay , an old bomber pilot who still has great faith in manned aircraft . <P>
