... a bulwark impregnable to the new doctrines , in which Throne and Religion can take shelter confident that not one single idea of those which are stirring up the world will penetrate within . <P> Spain 's great and brooding Escorial was built to be a royal court , reliquary , monastery , art gallery , basilica and a pantheon of kings all joined in one . But most of all it was-and is-the symbol of the change-resisting spirit of Spain , as Philip II defined it when he decreed its construction . Now celebrating its fourth centenary , the Royal Monastery of San Lorenzo of El Escorial is the largest and most ambitious Renaissance building in Spain and still , in esthetic effect , an impregnable bulwark . <P> Built on the rise of the Guadarrama mountain range 31 miles from Madrid , El Escorial casts such a gloomy aspect that the Romantic Poet Thophile Gautier called it the " granite debauch of Spain 's Tiberius . " Even its floor plan reflects a grim occasion . The monastery is named in honor of a humble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his Roman torturers . San Lorenzo , it is said , calmly instructed the Romans : " This side 's done . You can turn me over now . " His coolness under trial won him a lasting place in Spanish devotion . <P> Thirteen centuries later , Philip II defeated French forces at the battle of San Quentin . By that victory he turned the tide to bring the Spanish Empire to its highest glory . Because it took place on Lorenzo 's feast day , Philip decided to put up a monument to the saint , the empire and God - built on the plan of a. gigantic gridiron . <P> On Straight Lines . The first stone was set just as the Council of Trent was ending , and for 21 years the walls rose to bear out in architecture the spirit of the Counter Reformation begun at the council . To the little town of El Escorial ( meaning slag heaps , from the nearby iron furnaces ) came bronzes from Milan , candelabra from Flanders , rare woods from the New World . Philip personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two miles away . He raised laborers by national levies , and many saw in the macabre plan of the monastery a visible proof of his will to burn alive all heretics from the Catholic faith . <P> At last in 1586 , El Escorial was consecrated on the eve of San Lorenzo 's feast day , with 200,000 oil lamps illuminating it so brightly that the glow could be seen in Toledo , 50-odd miles to the south . Its walls stretched 675 ft. by 530 ft. , embracing 16 courtyards , 4,000 rooms , 86 staircases , 88 fountains and 100 miles of corridors . Philip had commanded his architects to create " simplicity in the construction , severity in the whole , nobility without arro gance , majesty without ostentation . " Except for the gables , almost every line in the facades is dead straight ; the exterior is cold , unadorned and broken only by tiny windows ; the dome of the basilica is enclosed as if within a fortress . Thus at a stroke , Philip ended the tradition of exuberantly ornamented Spanish architecture known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and early Renaissance motifs .
