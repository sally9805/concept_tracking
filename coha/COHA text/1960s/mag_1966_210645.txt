The mere pursuit of civil rights , said the U.S. Supreme Court with unexpected sternness last week , does not give an individual a license to break the law . The ruling came in the case of 29 demonstrators who had been arrested in Mississippi in 1964 ( Greenwood v. Willie Peacock et al. ) , for such offenses as parading without a permit , obstructing traffic and biting a policeman . <P> Contending that they could not expect fair treatment in Mississippi , the 29 had petitioned for removal of their cases to federal jurisdiction . The court , which has long since demonstrated its sympathy for the civil rights movement , was well aware that such removal has become an important civil rights weapon . More than a thousand similar cases have been removed from local Southern courts to the presumably fairer federal benches . Nonetheless , said Justice Potter Stewart for the majority , until Congress changes the situation , " no federal law confers an absolute right on private citizens-on civil rights advocates , on Negroes , or on anybody else " - to disobey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not enough , " Stewart emphasized , that state officials have acted " illegally and corruptly , " that " the charges against the defendant are false , " or that the defendant will not get a fair trial . If people " are being prosecuted on baseless charges solely because of their race , then there has been an outrageous denial of their federal rights , and the federal courts are far from powerless to redress the wrongs done to them . " <P> Ultimate Vindication . In essence , that meant that federal courts in a variety of circumstances will continue to review state court convictions just as they have in the past . But pretrial intervention will continue to be a rare tactic . There are , added Stewart , specific situations in which such intervention is permitted . One of them grows out of the public-accommodation section of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . In Georgia v. Rachel , a separate decision announced the same day , Stewart , speaking this time for a unanimous court , held that no one may even be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public accommodation covered by the 1964 act . If anyone is , his case may immediately be removed to a federal court . <P> On behalf of Dissenters Earl Warren , William Brennan and Abe Fortas , Justice William O. Douglas argued that the defendants in the Greenwood case should also have been allowed removal . The federal courts can and do eventually overturn unjust state decisions , he conceded , but such ultimate vindication , he added wryly , comes only if defendants " persevere , live long enough , and have the patience and the funds to carry their cases for some years through the state courts to this court .
