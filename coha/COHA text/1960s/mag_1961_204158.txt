A week after their military revolt , South Korea 's generals were full of puritanical zeal . Khaki-clad troops with rifles patrolled the streets of Seoul , arresting jaywalkers and hauling prostitutes off to the cells . Caught dancing in a nightclub , 45 hapless young men and women were herded before stern military judges and sentenced to terms of up to a year in jail ; when the police ran out of handcuffs , they lashed the prisoners together with ropes . To keep people at home nights , the authorities arrested 10,000 for violating the nightly curfew-including those who had to leave after dark for medical care . " Under martial law , " snapped an officer , " you should n't get sick . " <P> General Chang Do Yung , who appointed himself Premier , seemed intent on stamping out the evils of years in the space of a few days . To help Korea 's starving peasants , many of whom have been forced to mortgage their crops at as much as 80% interest , Chang froze all loans bearing interest rates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slums , bulldozers were sent to raze acres of cardboard and tin shacks . The bewildered inhabitants were ordered to clean up the debris , then were trucked off to a barren new site , where they were bundled into large tents in groups of four and five families . Chang 's officers made it a prison offense to possess American cigarettes ; in so doing , they wiped out a lucrative trade for thousands of otherwise unemployed elderly women and university students . <P> Work or Else . In their zeal the soldiers were showing a pronounced impatience with due process of law . " We can arrest , detain and punish anyone , " snapped Chang . <P> Radio stations , guarded by machine guns , rang with martial music and the stern decrees of the new Korean leaders . All political parties were banned , and most of the Cabinet ministers in former Premier John Chang 's government were clapped in jail . Nine elected provincial governors as well as the mayors of the big cities were ousted and replaced by soldiers . Seventeen prosecutors investigating corruption for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banned , and the seven-day work week was now mandatory . Along with known Communists , thousands of liberals were jailed , and politicians nervously avoided their old friends for fear of coming under suspicion of " antistate " activity . Even the students , who were behind Syngman Rhee 's ouster in April 1960 , were cowed . <P> Was it all leading up to a permanent , perhaps bloody , dictatorship ? No , insisted Chang , civilian democracy would return , though he was naming no dates . " We have not killed anyone , and no one will be killed without reason . We have a love of freedom . A patriotic cause moved our soldiers . This should be properly understood . " But neither Chang nor tough little Major General Pak Chung-Hi , whom many consider the real power behind the junta , was willing to put the 7,000 Korean troops used in the revolt back under the authority of the United Nations Korea commander , the U.S. 's Carter B. Magruder . Only after hours of patient negotiation was a compromise reached whereby the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROK troops , leaving them with control of several units that they needed to keep themselves in power .
