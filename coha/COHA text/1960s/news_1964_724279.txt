txt If you are not registered to vote , tomorrow is your last opportunity to do so before the Nov. 3 election . All precinct polling places in Cook county will be open for registration tomorrow from 8 a. m. to 9 p. m . Our freedom and our constitutional system are based upon the participation of citizens in the duties of citizenship . One of those duties is going to the polls on election day and choosing among candidates for public offices . The winners of the election will decide the policies of the federal , state , and local governments . They will decide what taxes are levied and how the tax revenue is spent . If you want to throw away your privilege of taking part in this process of representative government ; if you want no part in government policy making , do n't become a registered voter . If you want to help make your government 's policies and have a voice in choosing the kind of leadership you desire , you must be registered to vote . It has been said rightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians . They need the direction of a patriotic and informed electorate . Register , if you have n't already , and vote Nov. 3.
