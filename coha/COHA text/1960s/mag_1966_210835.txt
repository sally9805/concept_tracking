One warm July afternoon in 1964 , off-duty New York City Policeman Samuel Lasky heard a noise outside his apartment door in suburban Mount Vernon . Two strangers were tiptoeing down the hall . Lasky hurriedly grabbed his pistol and managed to collar one , John F. Peters , who protested that he was merely visiting a married girl friend in the building . Not impressed , Lasky frisked Peters and felt something that " could have been a knife . " What Lasky actually found was an envelope containing burglar 's tools-for possession of which Peters was duly convicted . <P> Most citizens would surely agree that Patrolman Lasky was the model of an alert , courageous cop in action . Civil-libertarians , however , were quick to ask whether his search violated Peters ' constitutional rights . In a decision written by Judge Kenneth Keating , the New York Court of Appeals has just answered that question with a resounding no . It affirmed Peters ' conviction and declared that Lasky deserves " our highest praise . " <P> Beyond that , by a vote of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's controversial " stop and frisk " law , which empowers a policeman not only to " pat down " a suspect for concealed weapons in any public place , but also to seize " any other " illegal objects that he finds in the process . <P> Bullet for an Answer . The legislators who wrote New York 's stop-and-frisk law in 1964 held that big-city police clearly need authority to stop and question anyone whom they " reasonably suspect " of committing or being about to commit a felony or serious misdemeanor . They justified the frisk on grounds of elemental safety . As the New York Court of Appeals put it in a key 1964 case ( People v. Rivera ) : " The answer to the question propounded by the policeman may be a bullet . " <P> Ironically , what may yet shoot down the frisk law is the fact that the new high-state-court decision affirms the power of police to seize not only weapons but also anything else " the possession of which may constitute a crime . " In the Peters case , dissenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against " unreasonable searches and seizures " now means that any search made without the authority of a warrant is " reasonable only if conducted as incident to a lawful arrest " based on probable cause-something Patrolman Lasky admittedly did not have until after his frisk produced not a weapon but burglar 's tools . <P> In a companion case , dissenting Judge John Van Voorhis protested that the policeman involved was only " allegedly " frisking for a weapon when he discovered a supply of heroin in the defendant 's pockets . " Without probable cause , " said Van Voorhis , " the frisk discovered the heroin , then the heroin served as a basis for arrest , which , in turn , was claimed to justify the search which disclosed it . " Judge Van Voorhis insisted that a frisk should be tightly limited to its only legitimate purpose : " To discover and seize dangerous weapons . " If it becomes " a general search of the person " in patent violation of the Fourth Amendment , warned Van Voorhis , " we shall have progressed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
