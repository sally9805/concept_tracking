One of the aftermaths of last February 's demise of the Saturday Evening Post was the fact that the Curtis Publishing Co. had no magazines at all , while the Post 's sister publications , Holiday and Jack and Jill , were the property of a corporate hybrid called the Saturday Evening Post Co . Last week some semblance of the good old days was restored when Curtis reacquired Jack and Jill and Holiday . Simultaneously , there came an echo of the era when kids could earn roller skates , baseball mitts and bikes by selling Post subscriptions . Henceforth , announced the November issue of Jack and Jill , kids who manage to talk their friends into buying subscriptions will be rewarded with the 1969 equivalent of the bike and skates : 500 Green Stamps .
