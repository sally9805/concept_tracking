The Houston Post , with one of the biggest circulations in Texas ( 220,491 ) , has of recent years quietly tended to patiently building up readership and its reputation as one of the best in the Southwest . With ailing Board Chairman and ex-Texas Governor William Pettus Hobby , 84 , on the sidelines , his wife , Mrs. Oveta Culp Hobby , 58 , ran things with the same crispness that she brought to her work as wartime director of the WACs and as first U.S. Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare . Last week the Post reached over the garden fence and , by outbidding four rivals , picked up three neighboring dailies : the morning Galveston News ( circ. 17,974 ) , the afternoon Galveston Tribune ( 10,668 ) , and the afternoon Texas City Sun ( 6,150 ) . <P> All three were once run by Entrepre neur William L. Moody Jr. , who before his death in 1954 had built up a $400 million empire in banking , insurance , real estate , cotton , oil , hotels and ranching . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers , ' ' said Mrs. Mary Moody Northen , but in a bitter , two-hour meeting , stockholders overrode her . Mrs. Hobby 's winning bid was kept secret , and the philanthropic Moody Foundation , which supervised the transaction , would go no farther than to say that the underbidders did not include the Scripps-Howard or Newhouse chains . Said Mrs. Northen : " This has broken my heart . " <P> The Hobbys hastened to assure her that the papers would operate as they have in the past , as " distinct public serv ants . " And though the purchase gave the Houston Post Company a commanding position in East Texas , crew-cut Post Managing Editor William P. Hobby Jr. , 30 , Oveta 's boy , was quick to hush speculation that it was out for more . " Much as I like the sound of the phrase , " said he , " this is not the start of an empire .
