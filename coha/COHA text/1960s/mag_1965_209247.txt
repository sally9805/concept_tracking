" Jusceli-no ! Jusceli-no ! " chanted a handkerchief-waving throng of 3,000 at Rio 's Galeao international airport . Then from the doorway of an Air France 707 came the man , still trim and agile despite his 63 years , his face split in a toothful smile , his right arm swinging in a familiar jaunty wave . Brazil 's former President Juscelino Kubitschek-still admired by the people but loathed as a symbol of corruption by the present revolutionary government-had returned home after 16 months of self-imposed exile . Said he : " I have come back at zero hour . " <P> <P> Almost Unbearable . The moment that Kubitschek chose to return was precisely when the government was engaged in its first test of popularity since Brazil 's military seized power early last year . The day before he arrived , 9,000,000 Brazilians in eleven of the country 's 22 states had gone to the polls to vote for new Governors . In those elections , the government discovered that it had failed to win substantial popular support in spite-or because-of all its tough efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the P.S.D. Party of Kubitschek , who from 1956 to 1961 gave the country a strong surge of development accompanied by dizzying inflation , economic upheaval and graft . <P> His successors have not even given Brazil development . First , the erratic Jnio Quadros let Brazil 's boom falter , then resigned in a fit of pique . Next came the leftist Joao Goulart , who only compounded the troubles until the military stepped in , grimly determined to sweep out all the old politicians . <P> The new regime stripped Kubitschek of his political rights for ten years , but his party was allowed to campaign , spurred on by his behind-the-scene direction from Paris . Its victory constituted an almost unbearable provocation for Brazil 's military . At one point last week , army units went on combat alert across the country , and in front of the War Ministry in Brasilia appeared a quickly scrawled sign : THEY SHALL NOT RETURN ! <P> Actually , in seven of the nine small states , candidates favorable to the military regime won . The upset came in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , his P.S.D. man led the candidate identified with the revolution by 200,000 , with 1,500,000 votes counted and another 1,000,000 to go . In Guanabara ( Rio ) , the outcome was even more striking . The state has been considered a private fief of Governor Carlos Lacerda , the mercurial politician who has proved a gadfly to every Brazilian President since Getulio Vargas in the 1950s . Lacerda now has presidential ambitions of his own in the elections scheduled for next year . But to have a chance , he first had to secure his base by installing a hand-picked successor as Governor of Guanabara . La cerda chose a presentable crony , campaigned furiously for him . Nevertheless , Kubitschek 's candidate defeated him at the polls-527,184 votes to 437,075.
