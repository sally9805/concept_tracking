A THOUSAND DAYS : JOHN F. KENNEDY IN THE WHITE HOUSE by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr . 1,087 pages . Houghton Mifflin. $9 . <P> <P> Of all the Kennedy books that have cascaded from the presses in the past two years , this is the first from a professional historian . By no coincidence , it is also the best . As an ex-presidential assistant , Harvard Historian ( The Age of Jackson ) Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr . is not an altogether dispassionate chronicler ; he makes the fatuous claim , for example , that Kennedy 's legislative record was " unmatched in some respects since the days of Roosevelt . " But if he frequently hymns the Kennedy Administration , he also limns it with objectivity and perception . <P> Bowl of Jelly . Schlesinger was nowhere near as close to Kennedy as Speechwriter Ted Sorensen , whose own memoir soared to the top of the bestseller lists . No matter . Acutely aware of his peripheral vantage point , Schlesinger has managed-by using state papers , letters and personal interviews-to reconstruct the period so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memoir as a penetrating , balanced ledger of the Kennedy Administration . <P> Portions of the book have already appeared in LIFE and ten other publications , and consequently his opinions of the State Department as " a bowl of jelly " and of Secretary of State Dean Rusk as a man who " seemed actually to prefer stale to fresh ways of saying things " are already well known . On page after page , he betrays his view of Rusk as a man who is almost always silent because he almost never has anything to say-and he suggests that Kennedy felt the same way . What did Rusk think of Italy 's impending apertura a sinistra ( opening to the left ) ? " He did not have , as far as I could find out , any views , " writes Schlesinger . Of Berlin ? " No one quite knew where he stood . " Of the Congo ? " Rusk , it seemed , thought about it as little as possible . " <P> If his opinion of Rusk was low , Schlesinger is ungrudgingly admiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found Lyndon Johnson " a good deal more attractive , more subtle and more formidable than I had expected . " Defense Secretary Robert McNamara is a " tough , courteous and humane technocrat , for whom scientific management was not an end in itself but a means to the rationality of democratic government . " White House Aide McGeorge Bundy , " in spite of the certified propriety of his background , had an audacious mind and was quite capable of contempt for orthodoxy . " No one rates more admiration than veteran Diplomat Averell Harriman , " who said what he believed and cared not a damn for anything but getting the policy right . " He was known among Foggy Bottom types as " the Crocodile , " reports Schlesinger , " for his habit of abruptly biting off proposals which seemed to him stupid or irrelevant . "
