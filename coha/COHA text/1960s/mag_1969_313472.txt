Only six hours after the Shah of Iran reluctantly signed the order , the sound of rifle fire cracked across an open field near Teheran , and ten blindfolded bodies fell to the ground . The ten men were executed not for committing murder or treason . They were the first victims of the world 's toughest narcotics law . Iran 's vigorous police campaign began 14 years ago , when health officials discovered to their alarm that 1 Iranian in 10 was an addict ( total population 20 million in 1955 ) . In some villages such as Sabzavar ( pop . 40,000 ) , where the soil is conducive to the growing of poppies , virtually everybody above the age of five smoked opium . Over the years , a government crackdown against poppy growing reduced Iran 's addicts to 35,000 . However , smugglers began bringing in opium from Turkey and Afghanistan , and the number of addicts rose to 250,000 in 1968 . As a result , the government last July prescribed death by firing squad for anyone convicted of possessing more than two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cocaine . Another eight men are scheduled to be executed this week , and at least 50 more are being held .
