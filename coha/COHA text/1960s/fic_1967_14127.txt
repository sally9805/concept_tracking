SCENE : Two single beds with clean white sheets and pillows upstage center . Between the beds is a small yellow desk with a telephone on it . The entire upstage wall is bright canary yellow . A bright orange door in the wall to stage right with the words " CUARTO DE BANO " printed on it in red letters . Another bright orange door , stage left , with a cardboard sign hanging by string from the doorknob . The sign reads : " NO MOLESTAR POR FAVOR " in red letters . At the foot of each bed , on the floor , are two huge overstuffed suitcases . A large fan hangs from the ceiling , center stage . SALEM , a woman in panties and bra , sits on the stage left bed propped up with a pillow , facing the audience and reading Life magazine . KENT , a man in underwear , sits in the same position on the stage right bed reading Time magazine . Both SALEM and KENT have bright red skin . The lights come up to bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit reading for a while . They continue reading as they talk . SALEM The woman in  --  where was it ? Puerto Juarez or something . The very rich Spanish woman . Remember ? The young woman with her-mother who spoke such good English . Very rich . KENT What did she say ? SALEM She said the white of an egg is what you use for second or third degree burns . The pain is eased right away . What happens when the skin is burned ? I mean what actually happens ? p. 3 KENT Well , the epidermis is actually cooked , fried like a piece of meat over a charcoal fire . The molecular structure of the fatty tissue is partially destroyed by the sun rays , and so the blood rushes to the surface to repair the damage . SALEM So your skin does n't really turn red like magic , it 's just the blood rushing to the surface . KENT Right . SALEM So Mexicans are n't really tan , are they . They just have darker skin , tougher skin with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an anthropological argument now , where some say the dark skinned people of the earth were born that way to begin with for camouflage reasons to protect them against death , and others say it was to protect them against the sun . SALEM It does n't make much difference . KENT No . But the sun theory seems to make more sense . Well no , I guess the death theory makes more sense since Icelandic people , people who live in snowy places , have light skin to match the snow . So I guess it has to do with camouflage , since camouflage has to do with deceiving death . SALEM What about Eskimos . KENT Eskimos are more on the yellow side , are n't they . More Mongoloid . Eskimos are n't really dark . p. 4 SALEM Well , Mexicans are more Mongoloid than Negroid and you call them dark . KENT That 's true . ( KENT jumps to his feet and starts for the stage right door and then stops short . ) SALEM Que paso ! KENT I started to feel it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it 's coming or stopping . SALEM Que turista ! No ! KENT Speak English , will you . ( He starts again for the door and stops . ) SALEM Is it dysentery ? KENT I do n't know . It starts and stops . SALEM ( Like a nurse ) Cramps in the stomach ? KENT Slight ones . SALEM Nausea ? KENT Slight . SALEM Rumbling in the bowels ? KENT A little . SALEM Esta turista ? ( KENT starts to run for the door and stops again . ) KENT You sound glad or something . p. 5 SALEM No . Yo es muy simpatico . KENT We both ate the same food , you know , so you 'll be getting it soon too . SALEM My metabolism is very high . ( KENT returns to the stage right bed , picks up the magazine , and continues to read . ) KENT Relaxation is the thing you seek . You spend thousands of hours and dollars and plane rides to get to a place for relaxation . To just disappear for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SALEM You came here to disappear ? KENT That 's right . Did n't you ? To relax and disappear . SALEM What would you do if you did disappear ? KENT Nothing . I 'd be gone . SALEM I ask you that face to face . It deserves to be answered . KENT Do you know how soon it is before you can start peeling it ? SALEM Not before it 's dead , I can tell you that much . Right now it stings . That means it 's alive and hurting . Pretty soon it itches . Then you know it 's dying . Then it stops itching and you know it 's dead . Then you can start peeling . Not before . KENT You can start peeling as soon as it begins to itch . I know that much . That 's when you itch so you scratch it and that gets you peeling . p. 6 SALEM You ca n't start before the itching stops . KENT Why not ? You could even start while it 's still stinging if you wanted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a head start . SALEM And then really get burned . You 'd be in sad shape then , boy . KENT Then you start peeling again . SALEM There 's only three layers , you know . It does n't go on forever . KENT Obviously you 've never heard of the fourth degree burn . A fourth degree burn is unheard of because it 's never happened , but one day it will , and doctors will be dismayed from coast to coast , and a new word will be born into their language . The Fourth Degree Burn ! SALEM What is it like ! What is it like ! ( KENT rises on his bed and demonstrates for her . ) . KENT The fourth degree burn comes about after the most extreme and excruciating process has taken its course . The first degree has already occurred and a layer has dropped away almost of its own accord . Effortlessly it floats to the floor at your feet and piles around your ankles like sheets of Kleenex . The second degree comes with a little more shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust and covers the sheets . p. 7 SALEM And now for the third ! KENT Yes ! But the third takes time . The third begins slowly and creeps along the surface , grabbing hold and easing up . Biting down and relaxing away until the spaces get fewer and the biting gets harder . Everything burns and everything you touch is as hot as the sun . You stand away from everything else . You stand in midair with space all around you . The ground is on fire . The breeze feels like boiling-hot water . The moon is just like the sun . You become a flame and dance in mid-air . The bottom is blue . The middle is yellow and changes to green . The top is red and changes to orange . The breeze dances with you . The flame reaches up and then shrinks and bursts into sparks . The ground bursts into flame and circles the breeze . The sparks dart through the breeze and dash back and forth hitting up against the flames , and  --  ( The stage left door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro , enters with bare feet and carrying a shoe shine kit . Both SALEM and KENT scream and pull the top sheet of their beds over their bodies so just their heads are sticking out . The boy crosses in between the beds and just stares at them with his hand out . ) KENT Basta ! SALEM Vaya ! KENT Give him some money . p. 8 SALEM How do you say go away ? KENT Just give him some money . SALEM I ca n't , it 's in the suitcase . KENT Well get it . SALEM How do I get it ? KENT Crawl down under the sheet and get it . SALEM Ca n't you get up ? KENT Salem , you 're the closest one to the money . SALEM Oh , all right . ( She crawls underneath the sheet to the foot of the bed and sticks her hand out to reach the suitcase on the floor . As she does this , KENT speaks to the BOY , who just stares with his hand out . ) KENT She 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? KENT She 'll be right with you . If you were n't so poor , I 'd kick you out on your ass . BOY Lustre ? KENT Just hold on . Are they taught by their mothers and fathers to look more despondent than they really are ? ( SALEM is still under the sheet and struggling to open the suitcase. ) p. 9 SALEM Sometimes . KENT It works . All they have to do is stare . A blank stare does more than a grimace . SALEM Just stare back . KENT If I was that poor I 'd kill myself . I would n't pretend I was sadder than I really was . I could n't take it all the time , everywhere I went , every time I got up , knowing I was no better off and no worse than yesterday . Just the same all the time . Just poor . BOY Lustre ? KENT To just go on and on , getting older and older , and staying just as poor , and maybe even getting poorer . And pretending all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why the mothers sometimes give their babies away to tourists , because they know there 's a better chance of them getting rich . KENT Who 'd want a poor kid ? SALEM Some people who ca n't have a rich one . BOY Lustre ? KENT What 's he want ? SALEM To shine your shoes . KENT No shine . Go away . Basta ! BOY Lustre ? KENT No ! ( He puts his head under the sheet . The BOY just stands. ) p. 10 SALEM Let him shine your shoes . KENT No ! I ca n't even look at him . His hands are full of pork grease ; his eyes are red ; his breath smells . Get him away . SALEM Ah ha ! ( She opens the suitcase , and money pours out of it . She gestures with her hand for the BOY to come and take some money . Her hand is the only visible part of her . ) SALEM Aqui nio ! Aqui ! ( The BOY keeps staring at KENT , who remains under the sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aqui . Quiere diero ? Por favor . Aqui . KENT What 's he doing ? SALEM Will you be quiet . He wo n't even move . He does n't even know there 's free money to be had . KENT Great . SALEM Nio por favor . Aqui . Es muy bueno . ( This speech should sound like an English safari hunter warning somebody about a man-eating lion . During this , SALEM 'S hand can be seen waving money at the BOY . KENT stays under the sheet through the speech . ) KENT He 'll never leave now . He 's probably never seen a house like this in his life . He grew up in a village , in a hut . He nursed his mother 's milk until he was four and a half and then almost died from dysentery at the time he was weaned . He 's eaten nothing but rice and beans all his life and slept on the dirt and sold dirty Coca Cola to passing cars . He 'll never leave now no matter how much you give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditioning . The beds to him are like two Rolls Royces . He likes the sound of my voice because it 's so strange and soothing and he knows I 'm talking about him , and he likes that because , where he lives in the jungle , nobody talks about him , because he 's nothing different to them . They 're all the same and silent , and sleep and walk around each other like herds of wild boar getting ready to run or kill each other , depending upon the air and the wind and the sun . p. 11 SALEM Well what shall we do about that . KENT Can you reach the phone ? SALEM You 're closer to it than me . KENT O.K. Maybe the manager will know what to do . ( KENT starts to reach for the phone . The BOY rushes to the phone and pulls it out of the wall , then crosses downstage center with it and sets it on the floor . He sits down next to the phone and sets the shoe shine kit down and smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes different monster faces at the audience , from sticking his tongue out to giving them the finger . ) SALEM ( still under the sheet ) What happened ? KENT ( Now visible ) The little prick pulled the phone out of the wall . ( SALEM laughs . ) All right ! ( KENT jumps out of bed and crosses down to the BOY , who just sits center stage facing the audience . ) SALEM ( Still under the sheets ) Are you out of bed , dear ? KENT ( To the BOY ) You have to leave now . This is not your home . Go back from where you come from . ( The BOY stands and spits in KENT 'S face . KENT rushes back to the bed and wipes the spit off with the sheet . The BOY sits again and continues making faces to the audience. ) p. 12 KENT OOOooooh ! Oh my God ! Aaaah ! Spit ! He spit on me ! Oh no ! Oh my God ! Jesus ! He spit on me ! SALEM What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He spit all over me . Oh my God ! ( He wipes himself frantically with the sheet . The BOY smiles at the audience . SALEM works her way under the sheets to the head of the bed and pokes her head out . ) SALEM What 's going on ? KENT Oh , I ca n't stand it . The little prick ! Oh God ! I 'll have to take a shower ! Aah ! Oh my God ! What a rotten thing to do ! ( He rushes to the stage right door and goes inside , slamming the door behind him . SALEM speaks to the BOY from the bed . The BOY does not turn to her but continues making faces to the audience . KENT can be heard groaning behind the door . ) SALEM When I was about ten I think , little boy , I 'd just returned home from a car trip to the county fair with my family . My father , my mother , my sisters and brothers . We 'd just gotten home after driving for about two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of us had spoken for the whole trip . Are you listening . It was the same as though we 'd all been asleep , and we drove in the driveway , and my father stopped the car . But instead of any of us getting out right away like we usually did we all just sat in the car staring ahead and not speaking for a very long time . I was the first to get out and start walking toward the cement steps that led to the porch and I could hear my family behind me . My father , my mother , my sisters and brothers . And I could hear all four doors of the car slam one after the other like gun shots from a rifle . And I could hear their feet following me up the stairs to the porch right behind me . Very silent . I was leading them sort of and I was only about ten years old . I got to the top of the stairs and I was standing on the porch . I was the first one there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right at me . All staggered because of the steps , and all their eyes staring right at me . I saw them like that just for a second , and then do you know what I did little boy ? I spit on the very top step just before my father stepped down . And just as he stepped on that little spot of spit that had nothing dirtier in it than cotton candy and caramel apple , my whole family burst into noise like you never ever heard . And my father took off his belt that he 'd just bought at the county fair . A black leather belt with a silver buckle and a picture of Trigger engraved on the front . And my father took one more step to the top of the porch with the belt hanging down from his right hand and the buckle clinking on the cement . Then he swung his arm around slowly behind his back so that the belt dragged through the air following his wrist and came back so fast that all I could hear was a crack as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then they were silent again and waited there on the steps until my father put the belt back through the loops and buckled the buckle and hitched his jeans up over his hips . Then they all went into the house in a line . My father first , my mother second , my sisters and brothers third . And I stayed there in a ball , all rolled up , with my knees next to my chin and my hands rubbing my ankles . And I felt very good that they 'd left me there by myself . ( The telephone rings ; the BOY picks up the receiver and answers. ) p. 13 BOY Hello . What ? How did you know where I was ? SALEM Who is it ? KENT ( From behind the door , yelling ) Salem ! I do have diarrhea after all ! BOY ( To the telephone ) If I told you it would n't make any difference . What difference ? I 'm in a hotel somewhere . Why do n't you leave me alone ? SALEM Your papa ? BOY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warm Coca Cola ? Refried beans ? Wormy corn ? A hammock at night ? SALEM Your mama ? BOY I have air conditioning and two Rolls Royces . Match that , baby . SALEM Your sisters and brothers . KENT Salem ! BOY Later , man . Tell it to the old lady . I 'm out here on my own . Adios . ( He hangs up the phone and stands ; he turns to SALEM . ) SALEM Your papa , right ? He wants to know where you are ? ( The BOY crosses up to the stage right bed and feels the mattress , then takes off his pants and climbs into the bed and gets under the sheets. ) p. 14 KENT Salem ! I wo n't be able to move ! SALEM Now you 're in muy mucho trouble , kid . BOY What do you know about trouble , mom ? SALEM Mom ? BOY You ever had Mexican ranchers ride into your village at two in the morning and kill your father and steal your sisters and brothers for working in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soup . Lord have mercy . SALEM That sounds like a movie . BOY I was in a movie once . SALEM Yeah ? BOY I had to follow this cat around with a palm fan while he scored on all the native chicks . SALEM Did he ride a horse ? BOY How do you score chicks on a horse ? SALEM Well he could get off now and then . BOY You mean he rides from village to village and leaves the broads pregnant , and then the doctor comes around and asks them who the man was , and they all say : " I do n't know . He never told me his name , " and then you hear this , " Hi Yo Silver ! Away ! " in the distance ? SALEM Maybe . p. 15 BOY No , this guy was very cool . He wore linen shirts and handmade Campeche boots and one of those straight brimmed Panamanian hats and a pistol with abalone plates on the handle . And nobody bugged him because they never knew what he was really like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They look very together and calm . Like you could walk up to one and just pet him gently on the nose and feel his silky fur , but you do n't do that because they have something else going on that you 're not sure about . Something hidden somewhere . Well this cat was like that and even moved like a jaguar . You know , sort of slinky . He hardly ever talked , and when he did it was like a rumble , like a purr . KENT ( Still behind the door ) Salem ! It 's getting worse ! It 's very , very loose ! SALEM So what did he do ? BOY Who ? SALEM The guy with the linen shirts . BOY That 's what I 'm saying . He did n't have to do anything . He just sat around and did his stick and everything was taken care of . No worry about a place to sack out . No worry about food or booze . And when he felt like splitting he just took off . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cool at the end . SALEM How ? p. 16 BOY What difference . They just did . In real life he never would . I mean a cat like that does n't get all turned around when some villager makes a wise crack about his hat . SALEM That 's what happened ? BOY Yeah . This fool walked up and told him his hat made him look like a clown or something like that and the cat fell right into a trap where the villagers tore him up and ate him alive . Like cannibalism or something . SALEM Then what happened ? BOY All the women committed suicide . SALEM Really ? BOY Yeah . But that 's what I want to be like , mom . Except I would n't blow my cool . Not about a hat anyway . A hat 's just something you wear to keep off the sun . One hat 's as good as another . You blow your cool about other shit . Like when a man spits in your face . ( KENT enters from the stage right door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt , handmade boots , underwear , and a pistol around his waist . His skin is now pale white and should appear made up . He crosses center stage , strutting . ) KENT Well ! I feel like a new man after all that . I think I finally flushed that old amoeba right down the old drain . ( He struts up and down , hitching his pistol on his hips. ) p. 17 BOY Ole ! KENT Yes , sir ! Nothing like a little amoebic dysentery to build up a man 's immunity to his environment . That 's the trouble with the States you know . Everything 's so clean and pure and immaculate up there that a man does n't even have a chance to build up his own immunity . They 're breeding a bunch of lily livered weaklings up there simply by not having a little dirty water around to toughen people up . Before you know it them people ai n't going to be able to travel nowhere outside their own country on account of their low resistance . An isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Now they got some minds , I 'll grant you that . But the mind ai n't nothing without the old body tagging along behind to follow things through . And the old body ai n't nothing without a little amoeba . SALEM Bravo ! ( SALEM and BOY hum , " When Johnny Comes Marching Home , " as KENT struts more proudly up and down and takes out the pistol and starts twirling it on his trigger finger . ) KENT Yes sir ! That 's always been true as long as man 's been around on this earth and it ai n't going to stop just on account of a few high falootin ' ideas about comfort and leisure . No sirree ! Why it 'll get so bad up there that even foreigners wo n't be able to come in on account of they wo n't be able to take the cleanliness . Their systems will act the same way in reverse . Nobody can come in and nobody can get out . An isolated land . That 's what I call it . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried away with himself as they hum louder in the background . ) KENT Then the next step is in-breeding in a culture like that where there 's no one coming in and no one getting out . Incest ! Yes sirree ! The land will fall apart . Just take your Indians for example . Look what 's happened to them through incest . Smaller and smaller ! Shorter life span ! Rotten teeth ! Low resistance ! The population shrinks . The people die away . Extinction ! Destruction ! Rot and ruin ! I see it all now clearly before me ! The Greatest Society on its way downhill . ( SALEM and BOY stop humming . KENT blows imaginary smoke out of the pistol and puts it back in the holster , he sees the BOY in his bed and screams . ) KENT What 's he doing in my bed ! ( He faints on the floor . SALEM screams and jumps out of bed , she rushes to KENT and feels his wrists and slaps his face , she rushes to the telephone downstage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) SALEM He 's fainted ! He 's completely out ! All because of your dirty water . Is there a doctor in this town ? BOY I do n't know . Is n't that what the big daddy bear said when he saw Goldilocks ? What 's he doing in my bed , mothafucka ? p. 19 SALEM ( On the phone ) Hello . Can you get me a doctor right away ? Oh shit . Puede un doctor quiere muy- muy- ( To the BOY ) Can you tell him ? Please . Tell him I need a doctor . Tell him it 's dysentery . Please . I do n't speak very well . BOY Pardon me no babla espaol . SALEM Thanks son . Hello . Puede quiere un doctor de medecina muy pronto aqui ! Comprende ! No , no , no . Un doctor de medecina . Si ! Pronto por favor . Muchas gracias . No , no ! Mi esposo es muy enfermo para la turista . Sabe ? Bueno . Muchas gracias . ( She hangs up the phone and rushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels his wrists . ) BOY ( Still sitting in bed ) They say the white of an egg is good for poisoning . SALEM Just shut up . He 's got the trots . BOY You force about half a dozen egg whites down the throat and then they vomit up the poison . It 's very easy . They use it on dogs even . SALEM Look sonny , you just sit tight and do n't say another word , or I 'll call the chief of police and have them take you back to your mommy and daddy . What he needs is a wet towel . A cold wet towel . ( She crosses to the stage right door and goes inside , closing the door behind her. ) p. 20 BOY A wet towel is working from the outside in ! With poison you have to work from the inside out ! SALEM ( Behind the door ) It 's not poison ! ( A loud knock on the stage left door . ) SALEM ( Behind the door ) That must be the doctor ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it ! BOY I do n't have any pants on ! SALEM ( Behind the door ) Well put them on for Christ 's sake ! BOY Yes , mam . ' Scuse me , mam . ( He jumps out of bed and puts his pants back on , another loud knock at the stage left door . ) Be right with you boss . Just as fast as I can . Yes sir . Just hold tight for Jesus sake . We got a busy house here what with the master sick and all . SALEM Hurry up ! BOY Yes , mam . Right away , mam . ( He goes to the stage left door and opens it . There are a witchdoctor and his son standing in the door ; they are both very dark skinned . The SON looks exactly like the BOY and is dressed the same way . The WITCHDOCTOR is dressed in sandals , short black pants , a bright red shirt , a short black jacket with elaborate floral designs on the sleeves and the back , a purple bandana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the back . He has two live chickens tied by the feet and hanging upside down from each of his wrists ; he carries a long rope whip in one hand , a long machete hangs from his belt . The SON carries a burlap bag full of incense , firecrackers , and candles in one hand , and in the other is a large coffee can full of burning incense , strung with a long leather thong ; he swings the can back and forth by the thong so that the smoke from the incense rises . They cross center stage . At all times they should behave as though they have nothing to do with the play and just happen to be there. ) p. 21 BOY The doctor is here , mam ! Shall I show him in ? SALEM ( Behind the door ) Show him where Kent is and tell him I 'll be right there ! BOY ( Motioning to KENT ) Doctor , this is Kent . Kent is very sick from poisoning and needs your help . DOCTOR ( Crouching down next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! DOCTOR Pason ! Aeey ! BOY Si . ( The WITCHDOCTOR rises slowly and motions to his SON to set down the bag and the incense can , then he motions to the two suitcases on the floor . The SON goes to each suitcase and carries them over to KENT , who remains limp on the floor through all this . The SON then opens each suitcase and dumps the contents all over KENT ; these should be money and various tourist items . The WITCHDOCTOR , at the same time , crosses center stage and sets the chickens on the floor ; he then picks up the incense can and waves it several times over the chickens , crossing himself as he does this ; he crosses to KENT and does the same thing with him and then whips KENT across the back several times with the rope . He goes through the same actions over and over again , crossing from the chickens to KENT , and then back to the chickens , while the SON takes out incense from the burlap bag and places it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circle all around KENT . Then he lights each bowl of incense very methodically and crosses himself as he does this ; then he goes to the bag again and takes out candles ; he places the candles also in a circle around KENT and lights each one as he did with the incense ; after this is finished he goes to the bag and takes out a string of firecrackers and lights it at KENT 's feet . All during this , they chant these words over and over in any order they want to : " Quetzal , Totzal , Copal , Pason . " They can repeat each word several times or say them in series ; the whole thing should be very habitual and appear as though they 'd done it a thousand times before . They should now and then look at the audience and wonder why it 's there , as they go through the motions . Meanwhile , the BOY crosses to the downstage apron and talks directly to the audience , as a tourist guide speaking to tourists . He crosses casually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door. ) p. 22 BOY The people in this area speak the purest Mayan existing today . The language has changed only slightly since the days of the great Mayan civilization before the time of the conquest . It 's even more pure than the Mayan spoken by the primitive Lacandones , who live in the state of Chiapas . It 's even purer by far than the Mayan spoken in the Yucatan , where much Spanish and Ladino admixtures have been added . In short , it 's very pure and nearly impossible for an outsider to learn , although many have tried . SALEM ( Still behind the door ) Tell him to do whatever he has to ! Do n't worry about the money ! BOY The man here is the most respected of all , or I should say , his profession is . But then , we ca n't separate a man from his profession , can we ? Anyway , there are several witchdoctors for each tribe and they become this through inheritance only . In other words , no one is elected to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so very much to learn and the only way to learn it is to be around a witchdoctor all the time . Therefore the witchdoctor 's oldest son , whom you see here , will fall heir to his father 's position . He listens carefully and watches closely to everything his father does and even helps out in part of the ceremony as you see here . A great kid . SALEM Tell him that I 'm sick too and may need some help ! p. 23 BOY The people of the village are very superstitious and still believe in spirits possessing the body . They believe that in some way the evil spirits must be driven from the body in order for the body to become well again . This is why you see the witchdoctor beating the man . This is to drive the evil spirits out . The firecrackers are to scare them away . The incense smoke , or copal , as it 's called here , is to send the prayers up to the god . They believe the smoke will carry the prayers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look down and see the light and know that there 's somebody praying down here , since the god only looks when something attracts his attention . SALEM I think I 've got the same thing ! BOY Although there are several European doctors in town , the people will not go to them for help . Instead they call for the witchdoctor who comes to their home and prays for them and beats them up and then goes to the top of the mountain where the god of health is supposed to be . There is an idol there that the witchdoctor prays to in much the same way as you see here . Please do n't try to go to the top of the mountain alone though , without a guide , because it can be very dangerous . Last year a group of students from an American university went up there and tried to steal the idol for an anthropological study and they were almost killed . It 's perfectly safe with a guide though , and you can always find me in front of the pharmacy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SALEM It 's getting worse now ! It 's very , very loose ! BOY Of course , in the days before Christ , they used to sacrifice young girls to the gods . But now that 's been made illegal by the government so the people use chickens instead . That 's what the two chickens are for . They usually give the poor chicken a little drink of cane liquor to deaden the pain but sometimes they do n't even bother . You 'll notice a slight mixture of Catholic ritual incorporated into the pagan rites . This has become more and more apparent within the last century but the people still hold firmly to their primitive beliefs . SALEM Ask him if he can come in here as soon as he 's done with Kent ! BOY The marriage is fixed by the family , and the partners have nothing to say in this matter . The girls begin having babies at the age of fourteen and usually have about fifteen children before they die . The average life expectancy is thirty-eight for women and forty-two for men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get paid a salary by the men for each baby they have . The eldest son in each family always falls heir to the father 's property . The puberty rites for boys are very stringent here and vary all the way from having the thumbnail on the right hand peeled away to having three small incisions made with a razor on the end of the penis . By the time the penis has healed they believe the boy has become a man . p. 25 SALEM Tell him to hurry ! It 's getting much worse ! ( At this time , the SON takes all of KENT 'S clothes off except his underwear , and piles them neatly at his feet , while the WITCHDOCTOR takes out his machete and waves it over the chicken . He also swings the coffee can back and forth and chants more intensely . ) BOY At this time the clothes are removed from the man in preparation for the sacrifice . The chickens will be decapitated and their bodies held over the man to allow the blood to drop onto his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body and make him well again . The clothes will be burned since it is believed that the evil spirits still reside in his clothes . And if anyone should put them on they would have bad health for the rest of their days and die within two years . SALEM I ca n't stand it anymore ! BOY After this , the witchdoctor will pray over the heads of the chickens and then take them to the top of the mountain , where he will throw them into the fire and then do some more praying . Now is the time for the sacrifice . For those of you who are n't used to this sort of thing you may close your eyes and just listen , or else you could keep in mind that it 's not a young girl but a dumb chicken . ( The SON goes to the chickens and stretches their necks out on the floor . The WITCHDOCTOR cuts off both their heads with one stroke of his machete . SALEM screams from the bathroom. ) p. 26 SALEM Oh my God ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them over KENT so that they bleed on his back . The SON chants over the heads and crosses himself ; the WITCHDOCTOR also chants . SALEM enters from the bathroom ; her skin is pale white now ; she clutches her stomach and goes in circles around the stage in great pain . ) BOY Why madame , your sunburn is gone . SALEM I 'm sick and pale , and dying from the same thing as Kent . What 's happened to Kent ? How is my Kent ? How is my boy ? BOY He 's dead . SALEM No he 's not dead . I 'm not dead and I have the same thing . The same rotten thing . BOY You 're both dead . ( The SON and the WITCHDOCTOR continue to chant and stay in their positions watching SALEM and the BOY , but remaining uninvolved . SALEM goes in circles and paces back and forth clutching her stomach . ) SALEM Do n't tell me that . I wish I was dead but I 'm not . Do n't tell me that now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alcohol rub down and some hot lemonade . How can you speak to me in this way . I 'm having cold chills . My body is burning alive . How will I make it back to my home ? p. 27 BOY Plane or train or bus or car . SALEM Do n't tell me that now . Look at me sweat . Who 's around who knows what to do ? Who is there ? BOY The doctor 's right here . ( SALEM becomes more and more delirious , clutching her stomach and head . ) SALEM I 'm seeing things in front of my eyes . I 'm shaking all over . Look at me shaking . What 's going on ! My eyes are popping out of my head . BOY You could lie down . Kent 's lying down . SALEM Kent 's faking . Kent 's playing dead while I 'm the one who needs attention . Look at me now . Just look . Do n't look at him . BOY I see . SALEM No you do n't . You said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now I 'm getting scared , you know . BOY How come ? SALEM You would n't understand . Look at me . I 'm not even dressed . ( The BOY crosses and picks up off the floor a Mexican poncho that was one of the items in the suitcase and hands it to SALEM , who keeps pacing up and down . ) BOY You can wear this . SALEM No , no . I need something like a nice wool sweater and some nice cotton slacks and a nice big bracelet and some jade earrings and some nice warm shoes . And I need to have my hair all done and my nails fixed up and someone to take me out to dinner . p. 28 BOY Well wear this , mom , and as soon as daddy 's well , we 'll all go out to dinner . SALEM All right . All right . But do n't call me names . ( She puts on the poncho and then continues to pace as the BOY crosses to KENT and feels his head . The WITCHDOCTOR and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so silly . BOY Do n't feel silly . They keep you very warm . It 's what the natives wear . SALEM Not about that . I feel silly because I 'm sick and cold , and Kent 's very sick , and I 'm not sure at all about what I should do , about who I should ask about what I should do . I do n't speak and I 'm not from here . BOY Ask me . I 've been around . SALEM Around where , for instance ? Around what ? You 've got built-in immunity . Just look at me . I 'm almost naked . ( The BOY begins to put on each item of KENT 'S costume as they continue . ) BOY Better than being too weighted down with extra junk you do n't need . Just take a canteen , some sandwiches . SALEM Take them where ? I 'm staying here . You 're the one who 's got to leave . We rented this room , Kent and me . We 're on vacation , you 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice trip back . SALEM Not back ! Here ! We 've just come here ! We 're not going back now ! You can see Kent lying there dead and at the same time tell me I should have a nice trip back ? I can tell you it wo n't be so nice ! BOY Well , I hope you have a nice time here then . SALEM Put down those clothes ! Get out of this room before I call the police . BOY Someone pulled out the phone . SALEM I do n't care ! I want you to leave . BOY You 'll need me around to translate . To run downstairs to the pharmacy and get what you need . SALEM What will I need ? BOY Well , you 'll need sterile white gauze and tubes of green ointment and different kinds of hot and cold salve . And you 'll need ice packs and pain killers and iodine and stimulants and penicillin pills . SALEM I have n't been gored by a bull . I 've been screwed by amoeba and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably have little white heads and red eyes and two legs , but I know they do n't go on forever . BOY They 'll follow you around wherever you go . p. 30 SALEM Do n't try to scare me , sonny . I 've been around . You do n't know the first thing about amoeba . You could eat chile right off the street and not catch a thing . It 's me who 's in danger , not you . So do n't give me advice . Look how strong you are . Just look . Now look at me . BOY Well , how do I look ? SALEM Come up here , boy , and stand straight . Come on up here ! Come on ! Come on ! Come up here with me and let 's see what you look like now that you 've grown . ( The BOY crosses up to her , now fully dressed in KENT 'S costume . SALEM takes him by the hand and leads him downstage center ; she leads him back and forth by the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a market place full of villagers . The chanting gets louder in the background . ) Mira ! Mira ! Mira ! Look what is here ! Look what I have for you ! For any of you who has the right price ! Quantos pesos por el nio ! El nio es muy bravo no ! Si ! He has come to me from the hills with his father 's clothes and his mother 's eyes ! Look at his hands ! How strong ! How brave ! His father says he is old enough now to work for himself ! To work for one of you ! To work hard and long ! His father has given him over to me for the price of six hogs ! I give him to you now for the price of twelve ! Doce paygar por el nio aqui ! Come on ! Come on ! No ? ( She drags the BOY by the hand , down off the edge of the stage into the audience , and walks up and down the aisles showing the BOY to the people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the BOY in the same way the audience does , and in some way reflect the audience 's reaction back to them , but go on with their chanting . KENT remains limp . ) Quantos pesos por el nio ! Quantos ! Quantos ! What more could you want ? At this time in his life , he is worth more to you than all the ponchos you could make in three months . In four months ! He 'll bring in your sheep at night ! He 'll take them out in the morning ! He 'll scare away dogs and crows and cut up your corn ! Feel his calves and thighs ! Look at his eyes and his mouth ! He 's honest too ! He 'll never steal or lie or cheat ! He also sings songs from his native tribe and carves wooden animals in his spare time ! He 'll speak to you only when he 's spoken to and he 'll never ever laugh behind your back ! He 's trained to haul wood and carry water up to thirty miles without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more could you ask ? You can always re-sell him , you know . And you 'll never get less than six hogs ! His skin is clean ! He has no scars ! Probably cleaner skin than any of yours ! His hair is free of lice and ticks ! He has all his teeth ! What are you waiting for ? How much will you pay ? Cuantos ! Cuantos ! You 'll never get another chance ! How much will you pay for this boy ? ( The phone suddenly begins to ring . SALEM and the BOY stop immediately and turn to the stage ; they are in the center aisle at the back of the theater . The SON and the WITCHDOCTOR stop chanting and just stare at the phone as it rings ; the SON slowly crosses up to the phone and answers it. ) p. 31 SON Hello . What ? ( He holds one hand over the receiver and yells to the BOY . ) It 's for you ! ( The BOY crosses down the aisle toward the phone . SALEM remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going away on a trip . Tell them you 're going to the U.S.A. ! Tell them whatever they want to hear ! ( The BOY takes the phone from the SON and answers it . The SON goes back to the WITCHDOCTOR and they both begin chanting quietly over KENT 'S body again . The lights slowly begin to fade at this point ; also the fan begins to die down . ) BOY ( On the phone ) Bueno . Si . Si . Esta bien . No . Si . Volver a la casa . Si . Si . En esta noche . No . No me gusto . Si . Esta bien . No . Esta mejor . SALEM What do they want ! Tell them you 're going with me ! ( She begins to slowly cross down the aisle toward the stage now . ) BOY Estoy muy triste aqui . Si . Bueno . Tu tambien ? Bueno . Hasta luego . Si . Buena noche papa . Adios . ( He hangs up the phone and stares at SALEM , who crosses slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SON just stand staring at KENT and chanting softly . The lights keep fading . KENT remains on the floor. ) p. 32 BOY That 's my father . SALEM Your father is dead . You 're going with me . We have more things to do . BOY That 's the first time he ever speaks on a phone in his life . He says to start walking down the road toward my home and he 'll start walking toward me , and we 'll meet halfway and embrace . SALEM How will you meet in the dark ? You ca n't even see the road . BOY We 'll meet in the light . My home is far from here . We 'll meet as the sun come up . We 'll see each other from very far off and we 'll look to each other like dwarfs . He 'll see me , and I 'll see him , and we 'll get bigger and bigger as we approach . SALEM You and your father will die in your hut . You could come with me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could go everywhere together . BOY Then we 'll tell about where we 've been , and I 'll sing songs that he 's never heard . SALEM Your father is deaf ! ( She gets closer to the BOY as the lights get dimmer . ) BOY And we 'll sit together and smoke by the side of the road , until a truck come by heading toward my home . And my father will kiss me good-bye and climb on the back and drive off , and I 'll wait for another truck going the other way . A pale blue truck with a canvas back , carrying chickens and goats , and a small picture of the Madonna on the dashboard , and green plastic flowers hanging from the rear view mirror , and golden tassels and fringe around the window , and striped tape wrapped around the gear shift and the steering wheel , and a drunk driver with a long black beard , and the radio turned up as loud as it goes and singing Spanish as we drive out into the Gulf of Mexico and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll never make it alive ! ( The lights dim out and the fan stops as SALEM reaches the BOY. ) @x SCENE : The set is organized exactly the same as Act One except the impression this time is that of an American hotel room . All the color is gone from Act One and replaced by different shades of shiny tan and gray . The signs on each door are in English and read " BATHROOM " and " PLEASE DO NOT DISTURB " in black and white . The telephone is plastic . The fan is gone . The suitcases at the foot of each bed are matching plastic . KENT is in the stage right bed propped up by pillows and sleeping with a thermometer hanging out his mouth . He wears long underwear . SALEM is in the bathroom . She wears American plastic clothes . The lights come up fast . Loud knocks on the stage left door . KENT remains asleep . SALEM comes out of the bathroom and crosses to the door . She opens it and DOC , played by the actor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his son , SONNY , played by the actor who played BOY . DOC is dressed like a country doctor from Civil War times , with boots , a coat with tails , string tie , suspenders , a pistol carried in a shoulder holster , wide brimmed black hat , and a large black satchel with supplies . SONNY is dressed exactly the same as DOC but without the satchel and pistol . SALEM Oh good . Finally . Come in . You are the ones from the clinic ? ( They both enter. ) p. 35 DOC Yes , ma'am . ( Takes off his hat . SONNY follows suit . ) SALEM You brought help ? You did n't have to bring help . It 's nothing serious . DOC No , ma'am . This here 's my boy , Sonny . SALEM How do you do ? SONNY All right . DOC He 's tagging along . Learning the trade . Apprenticeship , you know . SALEM Well there he is . DOC Let 's have a look . ( He crosses to KENT and sits beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he talks . KENT appears to sleep through this . SONNY and SALEM stand by . ) SALEM I do n't know what to tell you more than what I told you over the phone . DOC Well you ai n't told me nothing . Was my secretary or something you must a ' spoke to . You ai n't told me . SALEM Oh . DOC So tell me somethin ' . SALEM Well . You mean symptoms ? DOC Somethin ' . Got ta go on somethin ' when you 're treatin ' illness . Otherwise you might as well be treatin ' health . p. 36 SALEM Well . He goes in cycles . DOC Cycles ? SALEM Yes . One thing and then another . ( Through this , DOC motions to SONNY to open up his satchel and hand him different instruments for checking the heart , eyes , ears , mouth , etc . DOC goes through these procedures , while SALEM paces around . ) DOC From what to what ? SALEM From sleep to being awake . DOC Me too . SONNY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . It 's not the same . We 're talking about something . We 'll be talking back and forth and we 'll be not necessarily deeply involved in what we 're saying , but nevertheless talking . And he 'll gradually begin to go away . DOC How do you mean ? SALEM You 'll see a person . Like you 're seeing me now , and I 'm talking to you , and you 're talking to me , and gradually something happens to me while we 're talking , until I disappear . DOC He leaves the room ? SALEM No , he falls asleep . Like now . He 's sleeping . But before you came , he was talking to me . Now he 's asleep . p. 37 DOC Now look here , ma'am . I need things like runny nose , aching back , itchy skin , bloody urine , runny bowels . Things like that . SALEM They are n't there . What 's there is what you see . Sleeping . I thought it was just fatigue , so we came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse than that . I can tell . DOC How ? SALEM By the way you look . SONNY ( Spoken in one breath ) You should n't worry , ma'am . Pa looks like that always when he 's checking to see what 's wrong . Honest . All the time . And I should know , since I 'm always around when he 's checking to see what 's wrong , and you 're not always around . In fact this is the first time ever you 've been able to see Pa in action . So you should trust me and him and not yourself . SALEM I know doctors . I 've been around doctors and they change faces . They have different faces that tell you what 's what . And I can tell what 's what from the face he has on . So do n't tell me . DOC You 'll have to tell me somethin ' more , ma'am , to speed things up . SONNY The more we know the faster we can get to work . SALEM What do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 38 DOC Look lady , no more dilly dally . SALEM I 'm trying to concentrate . SONNY Do n't try . You ca n't concentrate if you try . SALEM Boy ! You should be a doctor , Sonny . You have all this valuable information up your sleeve . SONNY I do my best . DOC Symptoms , ma'am , symptoms . SALEM Symptoms ! SONNY Things that show on the outside what the inside might be up to . SALEM I know , I know . Yawning . A lot of yawning , and then a lot of talking , then more yawning and talking , and finally sleep , and then waking and talking and yawning and sleep again . Over and over . ( DOC stands abruptly . ) DOC I have it ! Of course ! SALEM What ? DOC We must wake him up immediately . Right now , before it 's too late . Help me . ( He and SONNY pull KENT out of bed and stand him up . KENT remains asleep . ) SALEM What is it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we call chronic Encephalitis Lethargica , also known as sleepy sickness and as Epidemic Encephalitis , von Economo 's Disease . A disease that appears from time to time , especially in spring , in the form of epidemics . p. 39 SONNY See there . I told ya ' . ( SONNY and DOC slap KENT 'S face and begin pacing him around the room as they talk to SALEM . KENT slowly comes out of sleep into a groggy stupor . DOC crosses to his satchel and leaves SONNY pacing with KENT . He pulls out a medical chart from his satchel and unrolls it ; the chart is a nude photograph of KENT , with labels and diagrams illustrating encephalitis . He hangs it on the upstage wall as he continues to talk . He points to different sections of the chart with a marker as he gives the speech , like an aging college professor who ca n't remember his lecture . ) DOC It is a virus infection , attacking chiefly the basal ganglia , the cerebrum , and the brain stem . These undergo dropsical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas of tissue involving both nerve-cells and fibres . The process may involve other parts of the brain , the spinal cord , and even other organs . SALEM Oh no . DOC The illness begins , usually , with rise of temperature and increasing drowsiness or lethargy , which may gradually proceed to a state of complete unconsciousness . In some cases , however , the patient , instead of being drowsy , passes at first through a stage of restlessness , which may amount to maniacal excitement . As a rule , the drowsiness deepens gradually over a period of a week or more , and accompanying it there appear various forms of paralysis , shown by drooping of the eyelids , squint , and weakness of one or both sides of the face . The nerves controlling the muscles of the throat are also sometimes paralyzed , causing changes in the voice and difficulty in swallowing . In some cases the disease affects the spinal cord , producing severe pain in one or more of the limbs , and it is frequently followed by partial paralysis . Signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hemorrhages may be visible beneath the skin and in the muscles , or blood may be vomited up or passed in the stools . The effects last usually for many months ; the patient remains easily tired and somnolent , or frequently showing rigidity of muscle , masklike faces , festinant gait , and rhythmical coarse tremors , resembling the clinical picture of paralysis agitans and known in epidemic encephalitis as Parkinsonism . Other cases show a considerable resemblance in symptoms to chorea , and still others to the disease known as general paralysis ; and many cases which result in physical recovery are left with profoundly deteriorated mental powers . p. 40 SALEM I knew he was sick . What 'll we do ? We were on our way to Mexico , doctor . To give him a rest . SONNY A rest ? SALEM Yes . I mean to get him better . DOC There is no specific treatment for the disease , but he must be kept in motion and , if possible , induced to talk . The more motion the better , lest it prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this stage . SALEM Do you have some ? DOC Sure do . You take his arm , ma'am , with Sonny , and walk him up and down while I get the pills . Keep him moving at all cost . ( She follows his instructions while DOC gets a bottle of pills out of his satchel . KENT is yawning . ) SALEM What a thing to have . It sounds just terrible . And we were on our way for a vacation . ( When KENT speaks he is in a world unrelated to anything on stage , even when he talks to the other actors and even when his dialogue seems coherent to the action around him . ) KENT Haa ! Your hands are something , boy . Fast hands . SONNY He talks . DOC Good , good . Keep him going . Keep him talking . p. 41 KENT Do n't have screwy knuckles like that just playing hand ball or something . Hand ball you use the palm . But bloody knuckles . Wowee . SALEM What ? DOC Do n't worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but let him talk . SALEM What are they ? DOC Benzedrine . Just keep him going . ( He hands SALEM the pills , then crosses to the stage left bed and takes off his coat and sits on the bed with his hands clasped behind his head , and watches . KENT paces , with SONNY and SALEM holding onto his arms . ) KENT Just do n't worry . It carries me through . SALEM Should n't you be doing something else for him , doctor ? What are you doing now ? SONNY You should let Pa alone now , ma'am . It 's up to us to carry through with what he says . DOC Just keep him movin ' . SALEM What are you doing ? DOC Thought I 'd take a snooze here for a bit . It 's been a long ride out . ( He closes his eyes begins to sleep , as SONNY and SALEM keep KENT pacing. ) p. 42 SALEM Great . You 're doing nothing . SONNY It was quite a ride , ma'am . SALEM What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride when you have a sick patient . Doctors have been riding for years . Back and forth . Wherever they 're needed , they go . They even have to swear that they 'll do it before they can  --  KENT How should anyone know . They get thrown into it . SALEM ( To DOC ) Listen , is he eventually supposed to come out of it , or do we just keep this up forever ? Hey ! SONNY Shh ! He 's asleep , ma'am . SALEM Well how are we going to tell when he 's all right ? SONNY Pa will give the sign . SALEM But he 's asleep . SONNY He wakes up every half hour on the hour , then goes back to sleep . SALEM How come ? SONNY He used to raise puppies . They have to be fed once every half hour until they 're at least nine weeks old . KENT A doctor should n't fall asleep on the job . SALEM That 's right . What is he , a veterinarian ? p. 43 SONNY If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the job justice , then he should fall asleep and wake up rested to do a good job . SALEM Do you want some uppies , Kent ? SONNY Not yet . ( They keep pacing with KENT , while DOC sleeps . The pacing should change back and forth , from KENT pulling them along , to them pulling KENT along ; it should cover the entire stage and continually change speed and quality . At no time do SONNY and SALEM let go of his arms . ) KENT I know that type . That sneaky type . That member of the horror show who disappears into it when he does n't want to be seen , and then pops out when he does . SALEM I do n't know how to talk to him . SONNY Just relax . Let him do the talking . KENT That type came to our door once , with my family inside , where they always were . Watching horror shows on  --  The monster 's always a nice guy . Notice that . Always nice . SALEM Kent ! Wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we were going to Mexico . KENT So he knocks on the door , and Pa answers it , and the guy comes in with a briefcase . Right into the house . And the house is in the middle of the prairie , with nothing around but prairie and one huge factory where they make something inside that you never see outside . All you can see is smoke coming out . And he comes in , with Ma and brothers and sisters all around chewing on the furniture , and Pa dying for a smoke . ( DOC yawns , then begins snoring loudly. ) p. 44 SALEM Doctor ! Do something ! KENT Shh ! And Pa can hardly walk from lack of everything he needs . So the guy from the factory sits down next to Pa , who 's dying , and says to him , I see you 've got all these lovely sons and daughters , and Pa nods . Then the guy from the horror show says , and I see they 're all dying , and Ma nods . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see inside our factory , to see what exactly it is that we make , and they shake their heads . So right now I 'm going to give you a chance , and he opens up the briefcase which is loaded with different packs of cigarettes . Pa smiles and licks his nose . The kids gather around . Ma faints . The guy says , I 'm going to make you a little offer , my friend . SONNY Pa ! KENT If you change each one of the stupid names you gave your eight kids , from whatever it is now , to one of the eight brand names of our cigarettes , I 'll set you up in your own little business , and give you all the smokes you need . So do n't go shoving benzedrine in my face . SALEM It 's for your own good , Kent . SONNY Pa ! I think we need help . KENT You 're doing fine . You do n't even have to hold on . The pace is great . SONNY Do n't believe him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the point when they say that , you know that the last thing in the world you should do is to do what they say . p. 45 SALEM But maybe he means it . Kent ? Are you O.K. ? SONNY Just keep hold a ' that arm , lady . Do exactly the opposite of whatever he wants . Believe me . I 've learned . KENT You 're no doctor . SONNY Last week Pa and I were out at the Tuttle farm , out past Lansingville , to see old lady Tuttle , since her neighbors called us up and asked us to go give her a look-see , since she was doing a lot of fiddle playin ' late at night and they was all worried . So we rode out there about 3 A.M. one mornin ' last week , thinkin ' we 'd catch her at it if she was really doin ' what they said she was doin ' , and she was all right . She was doin ' it . SALEM Look , we have to get him well so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' out there on her front porch just as plain as day . Tappin ' her foot and rockin ' to the tune she was doin ' . Think it was , " Hang Toad 's Got No Stock In My Mind . " Somethin ' like that . SALEM Doctor ! SONNY So we sneak up on her through the shrub pine and sit there in the dark for a spell just listenin ' to that fine old fiddle a ' Mrs. Tuttle 's . ( DOC wakes up suddenly and sits up on the bed ; he stands abruptly and puts on his coat ; he checks his watch . The rest keep pacing. ) p. 46 DOC What ! SONNY Just tellin ' the lady here about old lady Tuttle , Pa . ( DOC gets involved in the story and wanders downstage . ) DOC Oh yes . Well it was a strange night . A night the likes a ' which could make you figure old lady Tuttle was the only one in the world to speak of , and we two , my boy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' on . Growin ' slowly . Rooted in one place . Lettin ' seasons change us . And Mrs. Tuttle was playin ' for us like she was playin ' for the world of bushes and plants and insect life . KENT So Pa was set up in business at last . DOC Shut up ! Keep him still ! ( They keep pacing KENT , while DOC comes down and speaks to the audience while walking around . ) SALEM Doctor . DOC So there we was . My boy and I , hidden from view . Invisible to old lady Tuttle . And we noticed after a bit how we was gettin ' entranced by that darn fiddle a ' hers . That old lady had us hypnotized there for a while , until my boy here realized it and snapped us both out of it . SALEM Doctor ! Pay attention to your patient . DOC Well we figured it out between the two of us but only after it was too late . Instead we fell right into her trap and walked right up to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 47 SONNY That 's not exactly how it went , Pa . DOC You shut up ! How it went is no concern of mine or yours . All I want to do is finish up and go home . KENT And leave me stranded . SALEM How can a doctor leave you stranded , Kent ? DOC By ridin ' out , lady . SALEM I 'll call the clinic . DOC Try it ! SONNY Pa cut the wires on the way in , ma'am . SALEM You what ! That 's rotten . DOC ( To audience ) So we walk right up to old lady Tuttle , who does n't even see us . Like we 're not there , even . KENT That means that I 'll fall asleep and never wake up . SALEM Do n't be silly . We 'll keep you going all night if we have to . KENT What about tomorrow ? SALEM And tomorrow we 'll go to Mexico . DOC And the closer we get the better we see that she could be anywhere . She could n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to check the phone . p. 48 DOC Do n't let him go at any cost ! KENT I want to check on the phone ! ( They keep KENT pacing . ) DOC ( To audience ) There 's one thing I could never stand in all those years ridin ' back and forth treatin ' sores and wounds and shrunken hands . SONNY What 's that , Pa ? DOC That 's the absolute unwillingness that all them sickly , misfit imbeciles had for going along with what I 'd prescribe . You say one thing and they do the exact opposite right off the bat . Soon as you turn your back off they 'd go in the wrong direction . Straight into what I was tryin ' to lead them out of . SALEM Doctor ! He seems to be all right now . SONNY Ya ' got ta watch the tricks , ma'am . Ya ' got ta develop an eye for the tricks so you can tell one kind from another kind . DOC It got to a point there , in my traipsin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last thing needed . Just let the fools work it out for themselves . SALEM He 's moving and everything . He 's talking and walking . That 's what you wanted . Ca n't we let him go now ? Doctor . DOC Sure ! Sure enough ! Let him go ! ( They all stop still. ) p. 49 SALEM Kent ? ( They let go of KENT 'S arms and back away . KENT remains standing still . Doc crosses up to him and checks his eyelids , then steps back . ) DOC All right . SALEM What ? He 's all right now , is n't he ? DOC Sure . Fit as a fiddle . ( KENT rushes to the phone and picks it up ; he tries to dial with no success ; he freezes as he hangs up the phone . ) KENT They cut the wires . The juice . SALEM Kent . We can take off tomorrow if you want . SONNY Why Mexico ? Why not Canada , where you 'd be less noticeable ? SALEM That 's right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd notice us right off the bat . DOC Especially with a corpse . SONNY They 'd notice a corpse anywhere . SALEM What do you mean ? KENT Not here . In Lansingville . Get a T.V. in here . Some sandwiches . SALEM No . That 's silly . We want to get out , not in . DOC I could stop by once a week . p. 50 SALEM Here 's some pills , Kent . Take some pills . You 'll be all right . ( She hands KENT the pills . He holds them in his hand and remains frozen . ) I 'll get you a glass of water . ( She exits into the bathroom . DOC and SONNY move in on KENT , who stays frozen . ) SONNY Unless ya ' want to follow Pa 's directions , fool , you 'll never get out a ' this hole . DOC That 's right . Listen to the boy . SONNY He knows what he 's sayin ' , Pa does . DOC Ai n't been travelin ' through hick town after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that otherwise would a ' made a corpse out of a live man if the pus was n't allowed to draw off . Ai n't been doin ' that and not comin ' back with some savvy . SONNY They do it with trees too , so do n't feel bad . DOC Just keep yourself movin ' , son . It 's the only way out . ( SALEM enters with a glass of water and hands it to KENT . ) SALEM Here , Kent . DOC See here , your woman 's right behind ya ' , boy . ( KENT takes the pills and a gulp of water ; he hands the glass back to SALEM , then stands. ) p. 51 KENT Well . Thanks , Doc . Hope you have a nice trip back . DOC Oh . Well . Nice ? Sure . It wo n't be so nice . I mean it wo n't be any nicer than it was coming out . KENT How nice was that ? DOC So , so . KENT Well I hope it 's nicer than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls of the room . ) SONNY That ca n't be . It 's always the same . Dusty , hot . Ya ' get tired and rest at the same places along the road , under the same trees . KENT Why 's that ? DOC Well , that 's where the wells are , ya ' see . Ya ' have to get tired where the water is so 's you do n't pass ' em by . Otherwise , you 're just out a ' luck . KENT Do n't you carry a canteen or something ? SALEM We can take off tomorrow then , Kent . If you feel all right . KENT How will you reserve tickets ? The wires are cut . The juice is off . SONNY That 's right . DOC Anyway we got ta hang around for a bit to check you out . Make sure ya ' do n't have a relapse. p. 52 KENT A what ? DOC A relapse . To make sure the same business does n't start all over again . SONNY You need your bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make a call from the pay phone . DOC Ya ' see ya ' could easily fall back into it if ya ' do n't watch your step . It depends on a very fragile margin in the basal ganglia . One little jar , and poof . You have to keep the opposite pole in motion in order not to activate the opposite one . SONNY He 's right . SALEM Shall I go make reservations , Kent ? DOC Not yet ! He 's in no shape to be wanderin ' into the freezin ' night the way he is . Out there with the crickets . KENT I think I 'll stay . SALEM Well then I 'll go . DOC No . You should stay too , lady . KENT Why should she ? DOC Well , I mean we 'll need somebody to mix up some jasmine tea with honey , and  --  KENT Sonny can do that . SONNY It needs a woman . p. 53 SALEM Look . Kent 's all right now , so why do n't the two of you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're no doctor . DOC Right . Your husband should get some rest now and special tea . Only a doctor with many years experience and  --   --  SALEM Just what is your experience ? SONNY Do n't talk to Pa like that . SALEM And what 's this business about cutting wires . DOC We never cut your wires , lady . ( KENT advances on DOC as DOC backs up . ) KENT I thought you said before that you cut our wires . DOC Naw . Never did . KENT I was under the impression we were juiceless here . Out of touch . No way of reaching the outside . DOC Try it then . Pick up the phone and try it . KENT Try it , Salem . ( SALEM goes to the phone and picks up the receiver , as KENT backs DOC around the stage . SONNY looks on . ) DOC You could call Berlin if you wanted . p. 54 KENT Why would we call Berlin if we wanted ? SALEM No juice . ( She hangs up . ) DOC Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a try . KENT Do n't move , Sonny , or I 'll gun you down . ( SONNY freezes . ) DOC Now go ahead , son . I have a gun . He do n't . I 'm the one that 's armed . Go on now . Let 's settle this once and for all . KENT Do n't make a move . DOC You got a lot a ' gall , bucko . Just ' cause you 're feelin ' your oats and all , now that you 're cured . You 're forgettin ' pretty fast who got ya ' out a ' your dilemma . Remember ? Your old Doc got ya ' out a ' what looked to me like suicide . Plain and simple . ( SONNY stays frozen . ) SALEM Do n't say that . Kent , let 's just leave . KENT He 'll die if he makes a move . DOC Now that 's pushin ' it right to the edge , mister . You got ta have a full house to be callin ' bluffs like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOC , as he moves him around the stage faster . SONNY stays frozen. ) p. 55 KENT It 's been proven that the wires are cut . Salem proved it . DOC Now Sonny you just go and give it a check , and then we can leave . Sonny ! ( He stays frozen . ) SALEM Kent , let him check the phone if he wants . Then we 'll go . DOC Who are you foolin ' with a finger . I ai n't from Egypt , ya ' know . SALEM Look , I 'll phone the operator and show you both . ( She moves toward the phone and freezes when DOC speaks . ) DOC Do n't make a move ! ( He draws his pistol and aims it at KENT . Now DOC begins backing KENT around the stage . KENT keeps his finger pointed at DOC . SALEM and SONNY remain frozen in their places . ) KENT Now why in the world  --  I ask myself why in the world would a doctor from a respectable clinic want to disconnect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to cure . A man who 's prepared to pay him two suitcases full of money in exchange for his good health . I ask myself why and come up with only one answer . DOC Now what would that be ? KENT That this doctor is up to no good . That this doctor , in cahoots with his fishy son , is planning to perform some strange experiment on this dying man that he do n't want to leak out to the outside world . So if this experiment fails no one will be the wiser , and the only one to have lost anything will be the dying man who 's dying anyway . ( They change directions again with KENT advancing and DOC retreating. ) p. 56 DOC And I ask myself something too . I ask myself why this dying man who 's got nothing to lose but his life accuses the one and only person who could possibly save it of such a silly thing as cutting the wires to his telephone . I ask myself that and come up with only one answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't dying at all . That this here man is aching all over for only one thing . And he cunningly puts the idea into the mind of the doctor , and the doctor then acts it out . The doctor performs the experiment with his faithful son at his side and transforms the dying man into a thing of beauty . KENT How ? ( DOC advances on KENT . ) DOC By beginning slow . From the hair down . Piece by piece . Peeling the scalp away neatly . Carving out the stickiness and placing cool summer breezes inside . In place of the hair goes a grassy field with a few dandelions falling toward the back . KENT And the eyes ? DOC Wet spongy moss covers each one and opens into long tunnel caves that go like spirals to the back where the light pours in . The nose swoops down and has crows and chickadees roosting all day on its tip . The doctor 's scalpel moves quickly over the mouth . ( KENT advances on DOC. ) p. 57 KENT Oh no . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way down to the chin . And underneath are thick round teeth with edges sharper than diamonds , so they flash at night when he 's eating . The flashes warn everything living within twenty miles , and they stay inside until morning comes . DOC The chin  --  KENT I told you ! You ca n't see the chin because of the lips . They hang down . And so does the hair . Long sheets of black hair that hang down past its waist and rustle like paper when it runs . ( DOC advances on KENT . ) DOC Doc and his faithful son stay up through the night thinking of shoulders and arms and a chest for the beast . ( SONNY makes a sudden move for the phone but freezes when KENT yells . ) KENT Hold it ! I 'll blow you to bits ! DOC At 3 A.M. , they get down to work . Moving fast and patiently over the torso . The arms dangle down past its hair and gently flow into beautiful womanly hands that look like they 've never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When it jerks up its head and bursts from the leather strap across its thin chest . DOC No ! ( KENT advances on DOC. ) p. 58 KENT But then it 's too late . The moment has come for its birth , and nothing can stop it from coming . ( KENT stalks DOC with his finger pointed at him ; he manipulates DOC all over the stage while the others stay frozen in place . ) DOC Not yet ! There 's the legs and the feet left to do ! KENT It opens its arms and its mouth and tests everything out . It feels how the juices drain from its brain , down through the nose and into the mouth where it tastes like honey . He licks . He kicks off the sheets . He rolls off the edge of the stainless steel table that rolls on its tiny rubber wheels straight for the wall . DOC You ca n't start before  --  KENT The fall from the table to the floor starts other juices going . He feels the stream of fluid pulling him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't even walk ! He does n't have feet ! ( KENT changes his finger from a gun to a knife and begins making quick lunges toward DOC , who jumps back . ) KENT He finds the fluid pounds through his legs and his waist . It catches hold and loosens up . It draws back and snaps out like a snake . He moves across the room in two steps and flattens out against the wall . He disappears and becomes the wall . He reappears on the opposite wall . He clings to the floor and slithers along . Underneath cages of rats and rabbits and monkeys and squirrels . He becomes a mouse and changes into a cobra and then back on the floor . Then onto the roof . p. 59 DOC Stop it ! ( DOC fires the pistol . KENT keeps advancing ; his gestures and movements become wildly extravagant , like an African dance . DOC retreats to every corner of the room , running away , while SALEM and SONNY stay frozen . ) KENT Then jumping from roof to roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from the wind and tasting the juice that 's pouring down from his nose and his ears . ( DOC fires again . ) He zigzags sharply around T.V. antennas and his ears catch the sound of the dogs panting as they rush up the steps to the top of the roof . He can hear barking and screaming and whistles . Beams of white light cut through the night and follow his trail . Sirens sound through the streets . ( DOC fires . ) He keeps jumping space after space and roof after roof . And each jump he makes he looks down right in mid-air between the roof he left behind and the roof he 's jumping to . He looks down and he sees a miniature world where things move like bedbugs and ticks . And then he looks up and he sees miniature lights that flick on and off . ( KENT leaps off the stage and onto the ramp ; he runs up the ramp and behind the audience , where he speaks . DOC intercedes with his lines from the stage. ) p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' around ! KENT The Doctor is torn by desires that cut through his brain as he leads the hysterical mob on the trail of the beast he once loved . DOC I ai n't playin ' around anymore ! KENT Now it must be destroyed . If he could somehow get to the beast ahead of the mob . Trap it somehow in a quiet place between smooth wet boulders , and talk to it calmly . I 'll walk right out on ya ' , boy ! Perhaps even stroke its long hair and wipe off its chin . To find some way of telling the beast that the mob will calm down if he only does . I 'd just a ' soon let ya ' rot away ! There ai n't nothin ' keeping me here . The Doctor makes a dash away from the mob and ducks into a dark stand of sycamore trees . The mob is confused and frightened without the Doctor . They become enraged and set the forest on fire . Now ya ' got ta be fair about this ! Doc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed through this section of land many times before on his calls . I done all I could . I diagnosed the disease . I treated what ails ya ' ! I ca n't do no more ! What more can I do ? He finds a narrow stream , where he usually drinks on his way back and forth , and slowly submerges under the surface . He swims along easily and lets the current propel him downstream . Moving through flowing green plants and yellow goldfish , and surfacing once in a while to check where he is . The monster has a complete view now , from his perch . DOC I got'ta keep my distance , boy ! A doctor has got to keep a distance ! I mean I ca n't go falling asleep on the job ! KENT He sees the stream cutting the land in half , with one half on fire , and the other half dark and quiet . He 's calmer now and sits on a rock , catching up with his breath . Look what would happen if that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panting for breath and clutching at long clumps of grass . He drags himself up on dry land and staggers on through the night . Afraid if he stops for a rest that the beast will be lost forever . Now the beast begins to even enjoy being up so high . Above everything else but the sky and watching the golden fire move down one side of the stream and consuming everything dark . ( DOC 'S " look " sequence during this ; DOC goes through different gestures that were KENT 'S in the first Act : running to the bathroom , swaggering , fainting , etc . ) Doc begins to feel lost now in the trees with no living thing around him but leaves that whistle and hum as though sensing the fire 's approach . He must find the beast . He begins to think if I were him how would I hide and how would I run ? Which way would I go and how would I choose ? I got ta keep strong ! The beast even likes the idea of not having to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shiny rock and just swivel to different positions and face in different directions . That 's my job ! To keep strong and quick and alert ! DOC I mean what earthly good would I be to you or to anyone else if I was walkin ' around just as sick as my patients ? No good at all . Now you can see that as plain as I can . That 's why I make a point to keep fit . KENT Doc bends slowly downward and finds he moves faster with his head pushing him on . He seeks out the shadowy places , always staying upwind and straining his eyes to find a higher place . That 's why I 'm always in shape . Gently , the monster pulls the moss flaps back from his eyes and lets the wind fill them up . His beautiful hands stroke the smooth rock . Notice that ! My eyes are clear ! My skin is smooth ! My hair is free of lice and ticks ! My muscles are well tuned up for any situation ! Just watch me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want ! You should trust me , boy ! I 'll get ya ' through ! Just let me show ya ' the way ! You 'll have to go with me though ! I ca n't go with you ! I 'll show ya ' how ! Step by step . One foot in front of the other foot . Let your arms swing free at the sides . Let the words come . He chuckles at the spits that the fire makes as it reaches the stream and goes out . Doc 's feet slip and clutch the shale rock and sand and his hands grasp for vines and stumps and roots and anything strong enough to hoist his aching body up to the top . The beast stretches and yawns and smiles . He misses only one thing : the face of the Doc the way it used to be , looking down and smiling with his big dark eyes and his scalpel in hand . ( DOC goes to SONNY and SALEM and shakes them out of their freeze as he continues to talk to KENT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KENT and persuades them to try to bring him back on the stage . They slowly move downstage , like somnambulists . As DOC remains on stage talking to KENT they move off the stage and onto the ramp toward KENT . SALEM and SONNY hum , " When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again , " as they close in on KENT . ) DOC Yes sir , ya ' wo n't have no trouble at all if ya ' go along with the cure . We 'll be unbeatable , the two of us . KENT Doc almost forgets why he 's climbing so fast and so hard until he hears shouts from the dark side of the forest at the base of the hill . They 've crossed the river and picked up his trail . Doc pries loose a boulder and lets it crash down the side . I 'll get ya ' one a ' them pinto stallions with a silver saddle and a golden bit . His beautiful hands are bleeding from clawing . His feet feel like they 're not even there . And hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use a thirty odd six and a forty odd eight . You do n't have to worry your head about nothin ' , boy ! We 'll walk into each town like they was puddles a ' water waiting around for a boot to come by and splash them out a ' their hole . We 'll always be taken care of , you and me . Always ! Just wait and see . He lunges and pulls toward the top . He twists in and out of small thorny bushes . He squeezes in between cracks in the rock as bullets ring out and torches flare in the sides of his eyes . He uses his mouth to pull himself up , and his diamond teeth blind the mob with their flash . Doc must get there first and escape with the beast . Get him ! Grab ahold of his arms ! Get him back down here ! Do n't let him get away ! His arms rip from the shoulders and chest , and juices gush out down his sides . He must find him there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , flapping in air like an owl at night looking for mice in the field far below . He must meet him alone for one final time . His teeth drag him up . Dragging the body along . Pulling and chomping down on the earth . Pulling up and chomping down . SALEM and SONNY make a lunge for KENT , who grabs onto a rope and swings over their heads . He lands on the ramp behind DOC and runs straight toward the upstage wall of the set and leaps right through it , leaving a cut-out silhouette of his body in the wall . The lights dim out as the other three stare at the wall .
