txt WASHINGTON , Sept. 6 ? The cold war goes on , despite the vacation season , but the battlefield is changing . The main focus has moved from the Yellow Sea , and the Baltic , from the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean , to the South Atlantic and even to the Caribbean . This is the central fact in world politics and even in the politics of the Presidential campaign . The Russians have their planes and technicians . in the Congo . Despite their appeals for " peaceful coexistence , " they are opposing the United Nations in its efforts to keep both Moscow and Washington out of the convulsion in Central Africa . They have assumed the role of political , economic and even military defenders of Cuba . In the languid American summer this may seem to be the same old cold war , but there is a fundamental difference . It is coming closer to home . Eight years ago the issue in the election was " containment " of Soviet power versus " liberation " of the Soviet satellites . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " roll back " Soviet power was the phrase  --  but now instead of Washington talking about " liberating " Eastern Europe , Moscow is talking about " liberating " Africa and even Latin America . Something new and extremely ominous is happening in the world . We are seeing inexperienced , unstable , and maybe even deranged men exercising the sovereign power of the new nations with the sup-1 pert of Communist ideology and military strength . This is the thing which officials here have discussed in private but obviously could not discuss in public  --  namely , that they were dealing with human weakness allied to Communist political and military power which created a wholly new political problem for the nations of the Western world . In the United Nations each nation has equal rights , but Lumumba in the Congo and Castro in Cuba , both faced with opposition at home , have the support of the Soviet Union , with its ideology and its military might . The situation in the Congo illustrates the problem . Moscow has moved into a civil war situation there , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nine : . teen Thirties . The magnitude of the intervention is not yet as great , but while the West stands divided on the sidelines the Russians are guiding Lumumba as Hitler and Mussolini guided Franco . It is not only that Soviet planes , trucks , crews , technicians and interpreters are in the Congo , but Communist advisers now surround Lumumba . Mme. Andree Bonin is present chief of protocol to Lumumba . She is a mulatto who was born in the former French ? colony of Ubango Shari . She became a close adviser to Guinean Premier Sekou Tours , whose Marxist policies she faithfully championed . Early this year she became a confidante of Vice Premier Antoine Gizenga of the Congo , and in close contact with Joseph Virius , newly named Czechoslovak Ambassador to the Congo , has had an increasing influence on Lumumba through her contacts with the Congolese press and radio . Similarly , Serge Michel , a LeftWing Polish-born Frenchman , occupies the post of press representative for Lumumba . He is fluent in Russian , was active in the Algerian Front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absentia by the French Government , and is said to be the author of many of Lumumba 's anti-Western speeches . In addition to these two , Albert De Coninck , an English-born member of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist party , Geoffrey Bing , a fellow-traveler who was formerly a Member of the British Parliament , and Jean Terfve , a Belgian lawyer and member of the Belgian Communist pasty , are all working closely with Lumumba . In Cuba , the liaison with Moscow is not as close , but it is clear that even there , ninety miles south of Miami , Fla. , Castro is increas. ingly dependent Moscow , and . Khrushchev is so confident of his position that he is coming to the ; United Nations in New York later this month to condemn the United States as a threat to the peace of the world . It is an extraordinary situation . There has never been anything like it in the history of world or Presidential politics . Yet , as President , de Gaulle 's statement of today made clear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat , and Washington goes on talking as if there was nothing to worry about .
