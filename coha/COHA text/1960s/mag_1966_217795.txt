It was a milestone of sorts . Into an austere caucus chamber in Bonn 's Bundestag last week filed a delegation of Christian Democrats followed by a deputation from the opposition Social Democrat Party . With West Germany 's political crisis entering its fourth week , Kurt Georg Kiesinger , the Christian Democrats ' candidate for Chancellor , met with Socialist Leader Willy Brandt to discuss something that had never been tried before in the postwar period : a " grand coalition " between the red and the black . <P> Also active in tentative negotiations were Erich Mende 's Free Democrats , who hold a slender balance of power between the two big parties in the Bundestag . It was they who precipitated the current crisis by quitting Ludwig Erhard 's Cabinet over budget problems . Now they were talking separately to the Socialists and to their former CDU partners about the prospect of forming a " mini-coalition . " <P> The experts could only guess at which parties would ultimately succeed in forming a new government . Some clues could be expected in how well the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

For years , Bonn has stood unbendingly for no official contact with East Germany , no diplomatic relations with any country that recognized East Germany , no detente with the Soviet bloc , until after Germany achieved reunification . As a price for participating in any coalition , the Socialists last week issued a set of demands , including the establishment of diplomatic relations with East bloc nations , all-out efforts for a detente with the Soviet Union with no prior conditions , and immediate economic grants to East Germany in order to try and ease the dreary have-not plight of that area 's 17 million inhabitants . Says Brandt : " We should not be hypnotized by legalistic formulas . " <P> Next day the Free Democrats came out with a foreign policy statement that echoed the Socialist stand . Even Christian Democrats were gingerly deserting some of the old doctrines . Speaking to a rally of young party members , Kiesinger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors to the east is an obvious necessity . " And Franz Josef Strauss , the powerful boss of the party 's Bavarian branch , publicly backed away from his insistence on West German participation in a NATO nuclear strike force , thus opening the way for a more conciliatory policy toward the East .
