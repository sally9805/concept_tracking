She took another sip of gin and finished the note to Tom . " And remember , I will always love you-Helen . " Below her signature she scrawled , " Do n't forget to give Dick his vitamins , " and her eyes welled with tears at the thought of how sorry they would be and how sad it all was . Then she pinned the note carefully to her black cocktail dress , took a handful of pills , turned on all the lights , and composed herself on the sofa . As the darkness swept over her , she was thinking : " What if he has to work late ? " <P> TOM came home in time , and Helen became an " attempt " instead of a coroner 's statistic . Did she really want to die , or was she just making a gesture ? Helen does not know now , and her ambivalence is typical ; experts on suicide believe that most acts aimed at self-destruction , whether or not they succeed , are really attempts to reach out for others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " <P> " There is only one truly serious philosophical problem , " wrote Albert Camus , " and that is suicide . " In other words , what is it that makes life worth living ? Religion 's answer to that question today is still powerful , but far more muted than it used to be . Most men take their answers from the self-evident pleasure of being alive and , even in despair , from stubborn hope and a dimly realized sense of duty to the miracle of life . Camus ' own answer was that revolt against the apparent meaninglessness of existence is noble , and that to revolt is to live-suicide is submission . He did not submit ; he died in an auto accident in 1960 . " It is essential to die unreconciled , " he had said , " and not of one 's own free will . " <P> Such admonitions have not prevented the suicide rate from rising . It is the tenth cause of death in the U.S.-in 1920 it ranked 22nd-and it is estimated that more than one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one time or another . The overall rate is 10.8 suicides per 100,000 . In the age group from 15 to 19 , the rate is 4 per 100,000 , up from 2.4 a decade ago , and is the third-ranking cause of death ( after accidents and cancer ) . Among college students , presumably because of the stress of work and the strain of readjusting values , suicide ranks second as cause of death and is about half again as frequent as in the non-college population of the same age . <P> <P> The Deadly Springtime <P> Citizens of other countries are doing themselves in even more frequently . According to the latest available figures , the U.S. rate was surpassed by Hungary ( 26.8 ) , Austria ( 21.7 ) , Czechoslovakia ( 21.3 ) , Finland ( 19.2 ) , West Germany ( 18.5 ) , Denmark ( 19.1 ) , Sweden ( 18.5 ) , Switzerland ( 16.8 ) , Japan ( 16.1 ) and France ( 15.5 ) . England 's suicide rate is a little above that of the U.S. Far below them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ireland ( 2.5 ) and Egypt ( 0.1 ) , although such figures are often misleading . <P> Accuracy of reporting varies widely . Besides in those parts of the world where suicide comes under strong religious censure , there are compelling reasons for relatives , doctors and coroners to report it as an accident or a heart attack . Not necessarily for religious reasons , the same is often true in the U.S. But certain patterns can be seen .
