For all its growing missile prowess , the U.S. still keeps squadrons of nuclear-armed B-52s constantly patrolling the skies within reach of Communist borders , both to respond to any nuclear attack and to act as a deterrent to one . In the course of their duties , on land and in the air , the B-52s have had twelve announced nuclear-weapons " mishaps , " the most famous being the collision of a B-52 and a refueling tanker over Palomares , Spain , in 1966 . <P> Last week No. 13 occurred . One of the huge eight-engine bombers , patrolling the Arctic stratosphere on an air-alert mission , caught fire and headed for the U.S. Air Force Base at Thule , Greenland , to attempt an emergency landing . As smoke filled the cabin , the seven crewmen parachuted ; all survived except the copilot , whose chute failed to open . Just 7-miles short of Thule , the B-52 crashed on the rough ice pack of North Star Bay and exploded . <P> Recurring Question . The accident was greeted with the usual outcry that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has an agreement with the U.S. that nuclear-armed bombers will not use Greenland bases , students marched in the streets . The Russians predictably charged that the U.S. was endangering the whole world , and peace groups picketed and protested angrily . But the ordinary newspaper reader was troubled by a nagging question that recurs with every accident : Could the crash of a nucleararmed plane set off a hydrogen explosion ? The answer is no . <P> <P> An interlocking labyrinth of safety Jocks , switches and devices has prevented any of the 13 " mishaps " from producing a full-scale " yield " detonation . Always unarmed except on presidential order , H-bombs are designed with a system of safeguards so painstakingly complex that the chances of an accidental nuclear blast are infinitesimal . For all the science-fiction myths and nuclear-horror stories , a hydrogen weapon is extremely and deliberately difficult to detonate-even for a skilled B-52 crew . <P> <P> The reason is that the maze of safety checks is built around the necessity for a perfectly timed implosion , or spontaneous inward burst , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper A-bomb implosion , which produces enough neutrons to generate a thermonuclear explosion , occurs only when the hydrogen bomb 's outer segments of TNT are triggered simultaneously . If they are off by as much as a split second , the H-bomb aborts , with little or no nuclear action or dangerous radioactivity . <P> Precise Pattern . To arm a hydrogen weapon for firing , which means creating an electrical ignition of all of the bomb 's TNT segments at the same instant , B-52 airmen must perform a ritualistic procedure requiring at least 20 minutes of thoughtful work . Unlocking arming mechanisms from a little black box , two or more crewmen operate an intricate combination of manual and electronic seals , switches and interlocks - some dual and others independent-in a pattern so precise that any misstep means starting anew on the entire arming sequence . Only on its successful completion does the bombardier 's gloved hand reach for the fateful switch .
