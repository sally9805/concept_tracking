By 6 a.m. , a crowd of 50,000 Buddhist faithful had gathered for the sunrise service on the banks of the Saigon River . Packed shoulder to shoulder under a 120-ft. - high pylon put up with the help of army engineers , they were led in prayer by shaven-headed monks while a girls ' choir sang hymns . Then down from a candle-laden altar was handed a glass case containing a small blackened object identified as the preserved heart of Thich Quang Duc , the first monk to burn himself alive during last year 's Buddhist demonstrations . <P> The relic was placed on the lead float of a mile-long procession , which began a parade through the city while flocks of pigeons and sparrows were released from cages. * Also swirling overhead : thousands of round paper disks representing Buddha 's " wheel of life , " air-dropped by chartered Cessna . Lining the parade route , sustaining themselves on peanuts , soda pop and peppered fish sticks , were 250,000 spectators . As the Buddhists celebrated the 2,508th year of Buddha 's birth and the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they plainly showed themselves a growing force in South Viet Nam . Significantly , neither Premier General Nguyen Khanh nor U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge was present at the ceremonies - a reflection of growing distrust of Buddhist aims . <P> Cowing Catholics . Ever since Diem 's overthrow , the Buddhists have worked diligently to expand their influence . They have launched a collection drive to build up working capital , are constructing schools . Vietnamese Catholics complain that they are beginning to suffer the same discrimination by Buddhists that the Buddhists complained of under Catholic Diem . <P> Tension developed between the two religious groups recently when Buddhists demanded the execution of Catholic Army Major Dang Sy , who is awaiting trial for giving the orders to fire on Buddhist demonstrators in Hu last year . Earlier the Buddhists had insisted that no mercy be shown to Diem 's jailed brother , Ngo Dinh Can - who was executed even though Lodge privately pleaded with Buddhist leaders against the death penalty - or to Can 's aide , Lieut . Phan Quang Dong , who was shot before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> In Major Sy 's case , Catholics angrily argued that he had only followed superiors ' directives to keep order , and Catholic army officers circulated leaflets warning of serious trouble if Sy was shot . Although the Buddhist hierarchy now speaks of leniency for Sy , fear of a clash persists . Khanh , a Buddhist , has taken pains to antagonize neither the Catholics nor the Buddhists . But he is angered by the Buddhists ' lack of support for his regime . <P> Late in the Game . Of particular concern to the U.S. embassy-where he enjoyed asylum for several weeks last year-is Thich Tri Quang , a frail , hot-eyed monk who heads the Institute of Buddhist Clergy . Quang has managed to confuse everyone about his political loyalties , but he masterminded last summer 's Buddhist strategy against Diem and is now thought to be a leader of the militant monks exhorting Buddhists to " assert " themselves . What worries the U.S. is the possibility that they will assert themselves for neutralism-and the question of why they have failed to assert themselves against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
