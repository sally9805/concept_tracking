To emphasize the changing character of his regime , Premier George Papadopoulos last week granted his first interview in many months to a foreign newsman . Over cups of thick Turkish coffee in his wood-paneled office in Athens , Papadopoulos told TIME 'S Wilton Wynn of his desire to reestablish parliamentary government in Greece , reaffirmed his allegiance to King Constantine and declared his own willingness to step down from power . Self-confident and relaxed , the Premier avoided any reference to the seamier side of his army-backed regime , which still holds 1,800 Greeks in prison camps in the Aegean islands . He even denied the existence of the revolutionary council , which until recently was a stronghold of his more conservative opponents within the junta . His words-spoken in somewhat stilted English-reflect the complex and calculating nature of the former army colonel who now rules Greece . <P> <P> VERY many people have tried to define our form of government . We have been called by some " a democracy without a Parliament . " Others have defined us as a " dictatorship with democratic ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is interesting is that we believe that a Greek state within the framework of democracy must be developed now . In order that a democracy may exist , it must be borne by political parties . Before such permission is given , we must be certain that the citizens who will form the basic material of these parties have become mature citizens . <P> <P> Unfortunately , the perversion of our political life in the past was so profound that I personally am certain that our citizens are not yet mature . We Greeks have the weakness of act ing not only from logic but from emotion , and the politicians of the past must be cured of this weakness be fore they can help start a healthy process toward formation of political parties and the holding of elections . If we reach the point where fewer . politicians insult the revolution and where they accept their obligations as servants of the people , then perhaps we may have the opportunity to talk about these things from a closer vantage point . When will this time come ? I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : A revolutionary council never existed . What existed was the consciences of those people who undertook the responsibility of fulfilling the aims which induced the armed forces to lead the Greek people to revolution . As regards the democratic spirit in the Cabinet , you may collect information from any source , and if you find any one person who can tell you that an opinion or at titude has ever been imposed on the Cabinet , I permit you to call me publicly a dishonest man . <P> <P> We hope that we can go ahead toward full realization of our five-year plan and that we will be able to lead Greece smoothly from the condition of a developing country to that of a fully developed society . We expect this society to offer adequate employment , to raise productivity to a satisfactory level , and to provide incomes that adequately meet the cost of living . This will eliminate Communism as a dan ger . In this country , we intend to face Communism by the only right method - social and economic measures , not by police methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
