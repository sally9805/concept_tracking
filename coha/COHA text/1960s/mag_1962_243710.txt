When an egghead runs for political office , his backers ordinarily try to build up his image as a regular guy . If , for example , he once went to a baseball game , he now gets billed as a devoted fan . But H. Stuart Hughes , running as an independent for Senator from Massachusetts , departs from this pattern . A Harvard history professor and the author of several scholarly works , Hughes is an egghead who makes no concessions to popular political behavior . <P> Opting Out . Tall and owlish , Hughes candidly declares that he has " never been a strenuous anti-Communist " and that his " sympathies have mostly been with democratic socialism . " He strenuously advocates nuclear disarmament , wants the U.S. <P> to start on it even if the Russians do not go along step for step . He favors U.S. recognition of Red China and East Germany , a " drastic reduction " of NATO , closing down of U.S. missile bases in NATO countries , and the " nuclear demilitarization " of West Germany ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister Adam Rapacki in 1957 . <P> In short , Hughes speaks to and for those people who in their horror of nuclear war believe that the U.S. can attain peace simply by opting out of the struggle . <P> In domestic policy , Hughes urges a 35-hour work week , a $1.50-an-hour minimum wage , subsidized housing , and " medical care for all . " Most politicians , on advocating such a program , would at least be inclined to temper it with ritual tributes to free enterprise . But Hughes does not bother with that kind of platform piety-or piety of any sort . " I , " he announced at his first campaign press conference , " am an agnostic . " Murmured a reporter in the audience : " There goes the ball game . " In one striking respect , Hughes does resemble his rivals for John Kennedy 's old Senate seat , Democrats Teddy Kennedy and Eddie McCormack , and Republican George Cabot Lodge , son of Richard Nixon 's 1960 running mate . Hughes , too , is a scion ; his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Evans Hughes , onetime Secretary of State and Chief Justice of the U.S. <P> Candidate Hughes is frankly contemptuous of the political pretensions of his fellow New England scions . At 46 , he considers them much too young and inexperienced for the Senate . " The President 's brother is patently unqualified , " he says , " and none of the other candidates is really up to the job . " Speaking Out . Hughes does not seriously expect to win a seat in the Senate , but neither is he running just for fun . To get on the ballot at all , he had to collect at least 72,500 petition signatures . His devoted band of followers , largely made up of pacifists and ban-the-bomb marchers , actually gathered 117,636-a remarkable feat . He has spent $30,000 on his campaign , piled up debts of $12,000 . What is he trying to accomplish ? He wants to get a serious public hearing for his ideas on disarmament and disengagement . He also wants to prove that a man without much money can run for high public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
