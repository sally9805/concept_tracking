THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment WE have long been of the opinion that electronic computers used with liberal doses of common sense and restraint are useful and admirable machines but that electronic computers used - without common sense and restraint can only get the user into hot water . Consequently , we were attracted by the heading on a recent Times story which went , " Computer Deflated on Biblical Finding . " Apart from wondering about the theological aspects of the matter , we were curious to find out how one goes about deflating a computer , since most of the computers we have any knowledge of exhibit a monumental indifference to the antics of their users . The answer was soon forthcoming . The Reverend A. Q. Morton , identified by the Times simply as a Church of Scotland minister , had used a computer in 1963 to demonstrate that the fourteen Pauline letters of the New Testament were not written by one author . The principle underlying the Reverend Mr. Morton 's analysis proved to be very simple . He reasoned that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " must fall into patterns that are characteristic of his literary style , that to learn what these patterns are is simply a matter of counting , and that counting is just what a computer does best . Ergo , the Reverend Mr. Morton 's use of the infernal machine . Needless to say , the counting could have been done , much more slowly , by the Reverend Mr. Morton . ( We had a college roommate who produced an undergraduate honors thesis in English by making such an analysis of Shakespeare 's sonnets . We have forgotten what he was trying to demonstrate , but the room we shared with him was filled with charts and graphs , all of which he had drawn up by hand . ) Using his analysis , the Reverend Mr. Morton " proved " that the letters were written by six authors . So the matter rested until this year , when the Reverend John W. Ellison , rector of the Parish of the Epiphany of Winchester , Massachusetts , decided to use the same method to analyze the published writings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Times . He discovered that the patterns in the Reverend Mr. Morton 's articles fluctuated " wildly " from place to place , implying that the articles had been written by several Reverend Mr. Mortons . The Rector went on to say that he thought he could " prove " by the same method that " five authors wrote James Joyce 's ' Ulysses ' and that none of them wrote ' Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man . ' " He that as it may , it is clear that the trouble did not be with the Reverend Mr. Morton 's computer . Statistics are a very tricky business , and , as any insurance company knows , become a reliable basis for prediction only if an all but unlimited number of cases are included . ( There is the famous example of the disease that strikes only people of fifty . Two cases had been reported  --  one of a boy of two and the other of a man of ninety-eight . ) The wild fluctuations that Dr. Ellison said he found in the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely that the writings of neither of them are voluminous enough to justify the use of statistical methods in analyzing the author 's style . Despite the Times ' headline , this is not the k:nd of discovery that is going to deflate a computer . Wandering Patio THE most widely travelled patio in town is the Velez Blanco , or Blumenthal , Patio , a two-story , **28;2974;TOOLONG rectangular courtyard that was recently installed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art as the central feature of a new wing , which also houses the Thomas J. Watson Library and the study rooms and exhibition areas of the Departments of Prints and Drawings . The patio was built between and 1515 as the inner courtyard of a castle erected by Don Pedro Fajardo y Chactin , Marques of Velez , in Wiley . Blanco , a mountain village near the southeastern coast of Spain . The Fajardos occupied the castle until around 1700 , when they became extinct . In 1904 , the castle 's absentee owners sold the architectural elements of the patiocarved-marble arcades , columns , and window and door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other in-situ Renaissance carvings , a wooden ceiling , and a couple of doors , to a Paris interior decorator , who moved them by sea , via Marseille , to Paris . In 1912 , George Blumenthal , who was building a big , externally austere Italian Renaissance house on the southwest corner of Seventieth Street and Park Avenue , bought the ensemble and had his architect , Goodhue Livingston , set it up as the great central hall of his new home . In 1941 , Mr. Blumenthal , who was then president Of the Metropolitan Museum and the retired head of Lazard Friires , died , leaving his mansion to the Metropolitan " for the purpose of ( a having my house dismantled , ( h ) having such of the structural parts of rrn house as can he advantageously installed in the present buildings of its Museum or in the buildings hereafter to he erected by it transferred to and installed in such buildings , ( c ) having the rest of the structural parts of my house disposed of in such manner as it may see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , making way for an apartment building , and the Museum saw fit to have the patio disassembled into some two thousand numbered marble blocks and stored in a tunnel in its basement . There this distinguished puzzle languished ( although not without hope ) until 1963 , when it began to take its present form and place . Its present form reproduces the patio 's original aspect more closely than the Park Avenue adaptation did ; for example , the three-sided , arched , colonnaded gallery , or balcony , or loggia , of the Livingston-Blumenthal creation has been replaced by the two-sided balcony of the old Fajardo days . " We 've tried to make it more like the outdoor court that it was originally , " Mr. James J Rorimer , the director of the Museum , to whom we are indebted for much of the above information , told us when we called on him in his office the other day . " We gave up the wooden artesonado , or ceiling , which it had in the Blumenthal house , and have put on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " On the way to the patio , Mr. Rorimer said , " In 1930 , when I was a young assistant curator , Mr. Blumenthal asked me and one of my colleagues what we thought he should do with his collection and his house . He asked us to write him a one-copy letter  --  no carbons . I wrote him that if he wanted people to see how he lived , he should keep his collection and his house intact , but preferably the collection should come to the Metropolitan . Well , he did n't like people who were too curious about his house , and his will reflects his decision . He and his wife now Mrs. Ralph K. Robertson  --  gave us a fund out of which the reerection of the patio has been financed . " Gaining the patio , which is now lit by daylight ( and , on dark days , by fluorescent and incandescent lamps above the glass roof ) instead of by a forest of giant candles such as illuminated it in the Blumenthal house , we gazed at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arms , griffins , dragons , sphinxes  --  and learned that the ceilings of its double balcony consist of nineteen hundred sixteenth-century enamelled Seville tiles , taken from the old Myron Taylor house when it was torn down , in 1960 , and , subsequently , from the Museum 's basement . Mr. Taylor was also a trustee of the Museum , so these are , in a way , family artesonados . The principal door way of the patio serves as the principal entrance to the Watson Library ( named after another trustee ) , where , in the main reading room and the periodical room , our guide showed us ninety-six handmade Danish chairs . " I think they 're comfortable , " he said . " I tried them out in my dining room . The library is the nerve center of the Museum ; without it our curators could n't function . We 've just moved a hundred and fifty-five thousand books into its stacks . We spent three years rebinding them . We clean the air in the library four different ways : we filter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take dust particles out electronically , and we have carbide filters to take out chemicals . Hyatt ! " We were joined by A. Hyatt Mayor , the Curator of Prints , and went on to inspect his new premises , which connect with the patio balcony . There , looking down into the courtyard , which contains statuary and plants , Mr. Rorimer said , " I roust have some mimosa sent up from Florida when the weather gets better . " " I saw some plastic mimosa in someone 's house the other night that looked remarkably good , " Mr. Mayor said . His chief nodded and , as Mr. Mayor took off in another direction , led us on a lengthy hike through some of the forty-three newly refurbished galleries containing European paintings . At its conclusion , we congratulated Mr. Rorimer on his stamina . " I wear Army-and-Navysurplus shoes , which I buy for nine dollars down near Twenty-third Street , " he said , showing us a pair of brown boots . " I have a piece of leather tacked onto the front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once gave me a pedometer , and I found I averaged six miles a day just in the Museum . " After thanking our host , we hobbled to the street Private Line THE recent disclosure that conversations over citizens ' - band radios can sometimes he picked up on the audio channels of television sets has prompted a friend to relay to us the following dialogue , which he overheard last week as he settled back to watch a basketball game : " Hello , Dickic ? Can you hear me ? " " Is that you ? " " Yeah . Hey , look , I got something very important to tell you , only it 's a secret and you got to promise not to tell anybody . O.K. ? " " O.K. What is it ? " " Not here , dope ! Call me up on the telephone . Over and out . " Coach AMONG the more invigorating all-weather spectacles that have added to Central Park 's diurnal delights in the past couple of years are those provided by an energetic young master of hounds named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and four boys who , clutching leashes and wear-ing pocket patches emblazoned " Jim Buck 's Dogs , " serve as so many ambulatory Maypoles for packs of from five to seven engagingly assorted dogs , enrolled by their owners in the city 's only locally and federally registered peripatetic academy devoted to ennobling the character no less than the physique of the Vhole Urban Dog . Counting both their morning and their afternoon runs , the handlers , travelling in pairs , escort more than a hundred subscribing dogs , taking them from apartments as far afield as Beekman Place and West End Avenue , through the Park , and home again , for a daily minimum of twelve miles per dog , or twenty-five miles per handler . The routes vary , and , accordingly , the dogs and their handlers are known and cherished on every path from the Pond to Harlem Meer by their Fellow Central Park indigenes : the early-morning bird watchers , hike racers , cops , and Commander Whitehead ; the later-morning nannies and mummies and tots , landscape painters , Richard Nixon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the handlers ' policy to pose gratis , when asked , as background effects ) ; the noonday foresters ; the afternoon play groups , school dropouts , lovers , pigeon feeders , ball teams , and drifters ; and the wild dogs roaming the woodlands near Harlem Meer , and the correspondingly underprivileged " pampered-pet " dogs either tugging or drooping at the ends of leashes held by owners with whom they lack the means to communicate  --  lack it , that is , until they and their owners find themselves enrolled in special basic-obedience classes with the gregarious , informative , and dedicated Mr. Buck , who is never too busy , even when he is engrossed in coaching enormous hounds in the art of leaping over Park benches , to stop and straighten out the curious on what he is up to . All this we know from having accosted Mr. Buck on a blustery after-noun as he was in the middle of a bench-jumping class beside the Mall . With a ready smile , he informed us that he is thirty-three years old and operates out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brownstone ground-floorthrough on Eightieth Street , off Madison Avenue , which he shares with his wife , Ann ; their sons Jonathan , Christopher , and Graham , who arc aged three years , two years , and five weeks , respectively ; their three dogs , Nimble and Lily , who are champion-bred Great Danes , each weighing nearly as much as Buck himself , and Lisa , a five-dollar mixed foxhound-springer spaniel ; and a hoarder , a beagle named Duke who is afflicted with chronic tonsillitis . The secret of his success in wholesale dog walking , Mr. Buck told us , dog , the straw boss , and so cm . " As Iong as you never put two identical temperaments in one pack or rogues or cowards , which we do n't accept  --  there wo n't he fights , and the dogs will learn from one another , the shy ones coming out of themselves , the skittish and aggressive ones mellowing , and each individual moving to realize his best potential , " Mr. Buck said . " Exercise provides sleekness and shiny coats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leads to participation in common problems of cross-country work , jogging , and jumping in a happy , receptive frame of mind ; it becomes a way of life . " We asked Mr. Buck how he had got into his own way of life , and learned that it had evolved as the answer to a rather peculiar personal problem  --  that of a compulsive horse trainer determined to live in the city . " I was born and raised with clogs in an apartment at Park Avenue and Ninety-third Street , but the determining hours of my childhood were spent with uncles and aunts at and around the Ox Ridge Hunt Club , in Darien , where I formed my fundamental orientation to life as a trainer of horses , " he told us . " I did n't realize it , though , until I received an invitation to try out for the American equestrian team for the Rome Olympics and had to turn it down . The reason was that by then I had done what was expected of Inc , and gone to work downtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a junior executives ' lunch club , and , on a training tour to Africa , hunted lions with a Great Dane  --  and then as a vice-president of a tiny electronics firm . Well , it happens that my wife is the daughter of a hotel man , and grew up with dogs in hotel rooms in thirty-eight states , and so Ann and I had dogs , and I discovered soon enough that I preferred walking them and the neighbors ' dogs in Central Park to putting on my tie and getting downtown to the office . But it did n't occur to Trl to go professional and forget about downtown until I stumbled on the realization that a gazehound can be trained exactly like a show horse . " We interrupted to ask what a gazehound might be , and were told that it is a category of dog that hunts by sight , or gazing , rather than by scent , and includes the saluki , the Scottish deerhound , the Irish wolfhound , and the Afghan , to name a few of the varieties prevalent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond and benefit no less than horses to the disciplines of the jumper course and of the whole range of grand dressage , the haute , cols of equestrian balance , suppleness , and obedience , which stresses the extending of gaits with varying degrees of animation and with varying balancing movements denoting impulsion . It 's like shifting down in a car  --  or , more exactly , it 's like the moment of suspension in a ballet leap , because it 's beautiful , and because it 's as much an art form as piano or the bullfight  --  and it 's where my heart is . " Show dogs , Mr. Buck said regretfully , need learn little more than how to pull against a leash , whereas his students are invited to compete with horses . A particularly successful competitor , we gathered , is a two-year-old champion Great Dane named Honey Hollow Broadway Jim , whom Mr. Buck called " the greatest Great Dane athlete in competition today . " Mr. Buck then told us that word-of-mouth advertising , largely along the East Side dog owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handlers , and that all but one of his girls were former equestriennes who had come to the city to enter such workaday fields as modelling , nursing , airline hostessing , and what Buck called stripping " a term they use in offset printing for people who strip negatives , " he said  --  and who had since grown too deeply enamored of the horsy approach to dog walking to dream of returning to their indoor occupations . Besides covering their basic twenty-five miles a day , the handlers do adminis-trative work , counsel troubled owners , write and edit a magazine devoted wholly to the problems and interests of urban dogs , escort emergencies to vet-erinarians and dog beauty parlors , and provide special services for dogs too old or infirm to go the whole route , or even get to the corner and hack without being carried part way . " I prefer women as handlers , " Mr. Buck told us . " For one thing , they 're more certain to react com-passionately to dogs who act up , and since we operate exclusively in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-lations as well as had handling . Our chief tester for prospective handlers is a smart otterhound named Oliver the Awful . Oliver knows when he 's testing someone new , and he can be counted on to leap into the first phone booth along the way-and slam the door and wedge himself against it . Brute force is of no avail ; the only way to get him out is to remain poised and quietly talk him out . A prospect who manages this without any help is qualified . " ?

" GV ell-Rounded ONE morning last week , following the resignation of five members of the World 's Fair Finance Committee and the subsequent series of cryptic discussions about the Fair 's financial position , we went to the Terrace Club , on the top of the Port Authority Heliport , at the Fairgrounds , for the annual joint meeting Of World 's Fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wc arrived an hour and a half early , and while the Fair 's executive committee met privately somewhere in the building , under the direction of Robert Moses , president of the Fair , and Thomas Deegan , chairman of the committee , and the man then in charge of the Fair 's public relations ( Mr. Deegan gave up his public-relations job two days later but retained his chairmanship ) , we stood by a bank of elevators watching feverish preparations for the joint meeting , which was scheduled to start at eleven o'clock . A dapper man wearing a dark suit emerged from one of the elevators , leading a troop of waiters in white jackets , who were carrying metal stanchions and large ashtrays . " Follow me ! " we heard him call as they-marched out of sight behind him . A Pinkerton guard shifted from one foot to the other and glanced uncertainly around him as a tall , gaunt , bald man stationed two boys in jackets decorated with gold braid behind a counter , where they were to check coats . The dapper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were now carrying a vacuum cleaner . One of the elevators delivered a man with a tool kit , who walked over to three public telephones and dusted them . At the large circular bar opposite the elevators , several waiters participated in a roll call of drinks . " Campari ? " asked a man reading from a list . " Here ! " a waiter answered . Four waiters hurried past us carrying a table set for six , and they were followed by a woman with a military manner , who was instructing a group of girls in the protocol of seating Commissioners , Borough Presidents , Deputy Commissioners , Deputy Borough Presidents , and Mrs. Moses . " And he sure to give everyone a press kit , " she ordered . One of the girls handed us a press kit . We opened the kit and read Mr. Moses ' introduction to the latest Fair progress report , in which he made some conditional financial predictions and compared the Fair to a university : " The visitor who gets our Flushing Meadow University catalog in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the entrance price of second-rate movies .... This is the opportunity of millions to obtain wisdom without pain . " Meanwhile , members and directors of the Fair were checking their coats , receiving their press kits , and being seated , according to protocol , in chairs facing the members of the executive committee , who were seated on a dais . " I sold a lot of Fair notes , and I bought a hundred thousand dollars ' worth personally , " we heard one man say . Senator Jacob Javits , a director , entered the meeting room , smiling and waving to his fellow-directors . He shook hands with the executive committee and then sat down . Mr. Moses took his seat , and Mr. Deegan called the meeting to order . As the members and directors looked confidently up at Mr. Deegan , he easily persuaded them to approve the minutes of various meetings held by Fair committees in 1964 , to accept the directors ' annual report , to stand in silence in memory of directors who had ? recently died , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1965 . When it had been agreed to elect Mr. Deegan to succeed himself as chairman of the executive committee , Mr. Deegan announced that Mr. Moses . would say a few words . " I have nothing to add to my introduction to the progress report , " Mr. Moses said in a low voice to no one in particular . " Mr. Moses said that he has nothing to add to his introduction to the progress report , " Mr. Deegan told the members and directors . " The next meeting of the hoard of directors will he held in June , " hr announced , and added , " Arc there any questions ? " Senator Javits raised his hand , and everyone looked anxiously in his direction . " Is there any provision for calling a special meeting of the board if one is required ? " the Senator asked . " Yes , " Mr. Deegan said . Everyone looked relieved . The meeting was adjourned . Exactly eight minutes and five seconds had passed since the meeting opened . Reporters asked Mr. Moses to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report , which had gone to press a month before . Mr. Moses told them that he doubted whether the Fair would make enough money to return the twenty-four million dollars that the city had advanced against expected profits to make Flushing Meadow Park ready for the Fair , and also whether there would he enough profits fur the promised improvements to the ? park when the Fair was over . Meanwhile , the members and directors were shown to their proper seats in an adjoining room for a preview of " To the Fair ! , " a half-hour film designed to promote attendance at the Fair this year . Francis Thompson and his associates had produced " To the Fair ! , " and done so in the same cheerful spirit that marked their previous film , " To Be Alive ! , " which was shown at the Johnson 's Wax Pavilion in 1964 . At the end , the audience applauded Mr. Thompson 's work and then went into the bar for drinks . During lunch , the members and directors were serenaded by a small strolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dolly ! , " " Let Me Call You Sweetheart , " and a catchy tune in which one of the rhymes was " roses " and " Moses . " Brief Encounter AYOUNG lady we know entered an automatic elevator at the twelfth floor of the office building where she works , and found herself alone with a tall , well-dressed young man who was tapping one foot in time to music coming from the elevator 's loudspeaker . As the door closed , the fellow suddenly smiled pleasantly and asked , " Would you care to dance ? " Our Friend shrugged and answered , " All right . " They did a few turns around the car , and upon reaching the lobby they nodded to each other and went their separate ways .
