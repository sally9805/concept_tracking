Are We Being En-Gulfed ? by Wolf Von Eckardt Last summer in Belgrade , I noticed a cluster of people in front of the show windows of the US Information Library on Knesa Milosa Street . They were admiring a photo display of Reston , the budding new town in Virginia developed by Robert E. Simon . On these much publicized pictures , happy children are playing around a modern fountain which graces a WOLF VON ECKARDT is the architecture critic of The Washington Post . His new book , A Place to Live : the Crisis of the Cities , will be published next January . handsome little plaza surrounded by gay shops with sunny apartments above them . The plaza opens to a man-made lake , alive with little boats and a dramatic water jet . The lake mirrors townhouses nestled among old trees . Here , with all the loth-century conveniences , is a Piazza San Marco and Portofino all wrapped in one , an answer to the eyesore and malaise of urban sprawl . Three years ago in The New Republic ( Nov. 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " one of the first modern communities in America worthy of the name . " Now a part of it ? the first village of seven ? had actually been built and USIA could show it off in a socialist country . Look what America 's ingenious free enterprise had wrought ! Two months later , back home , I was phoned in the night . " They are wrecking Reston , " an excited former employee of the new town told me . " They have fired Bob Simon ! " " They " is the Gulf Oil Corporation , ranked sixth largest of our ingenious giant business enterprises ( last year 's earnings $505 million ) which are now widely looked upon as the best possible saviors of our sick cities and suburbs . If only the big corporations with their huge investment capital , energy and presumed efficiency would move into the urban mess , it is said , a new " creative federalism " could rebuild the slums and build the compact , " balanced " new communities out in the country that are essential if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be preserved . Reston , of course , is the beginning of just such a community . And Gulf Oil did move in with the subtlety of a Latin American junta . Overnight , as Ada Louise Huxtable put it in The New York Times , " one man 's dream became a corporate subsidiary . " At their first board meeting , last October 27 , the new directors of the new Gulf-Reston , Inc. fired Robert E. Simon . Simon had known all along that a new town of eventually 170,000 people with a multi-billion-dollar return value would take a considerable capital investment . It takes " patient money , " not the fast buck kind . It is an investment on which , as James Rouse , the developer of Columbia , another budding new town , has put it " you may have to get rich more slowly . " Perhaps Simon might have waited until he could back his paper plan with the needed $50 million . But he might have waited forever and it would only have gotten him the kind of committee that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a camel or another fast-selling Levittown . So when he could acquire those 170,000 acres of wooded Virginia hills , 18 miles from Washington and on the fringe of the country 's most burgeoning housing market all in one chunk , he went ahead with $2-million of his own , a $20 million loan on the land from the John Hancock Life Insurance Company and , eventually , a $15 million investment loan from Gulf Oil . In less than three years this money bought a new way of life for about 3,000 residents and over 1,000 employees of Reston 's io industries . What with a lively mix of apartments , townhouses and single family homes , a golf course , a riding stable , bridle paths , three swimming pools , a lake you can actually swim in , three playing fields , seven playgrounds , garden plots , picnic sites , all kinds of shopping in pleasant surroundings , an art gallery , a teen-age club , two kindergarten nurseries , a church ( with more to come ) , an elementary school of special Ford Foundation sponsored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other attractions , and a host of other things , virtually all within reach of pleasant walks that are never crossed by combustion engines , it came near to being the utopian new community my article had previewed under the somewhat skeptical title " Could This Be Our Town ? " City planners from all over the world came , and so did the curious and the customers . Aside from the discomfort of being gawked at by the visiting crowds , the residents seemed content . It is silly , of course , as Dean Acheson once said , to keep pulling up the carrot to see how well it grows . But I tried . I went out there repeatedly to interview Restonians " in depth , " as they say . It was a bore . There was no story , because when I looked over my notes afterwards , it all sounded too good to be credible . The only really interesting thing was that a good many of the families I talked to did not participate in Reston 's much touted community activities ? the square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They did not relish " togetherness " any more than most of my friends in the city . Why , then , do you like Reston as much as you say you do , I would ask . I got the same answer several times : " Well , I guess because it is so pretty ! " So far Reston is , to be sure , a kind of country club . Townhouses sell from $23,450 to $46,800 , detached houses from $31,000 to $65,000 and apartments rent from $130 to $275 a month . That is n't much help to people of moderate income , let alone those in the ghetto . Robert Simon was going to start high enough so he could put in his playgrounds and walkways and facilities and amenities first . And then , as the industries moved in and provided employment for them , he would build for people with lower incomes . A year ago or so he applied for government assistance to build 200 apartments under the famous nonprofit 221-d-3 provision . The Federal Housing Administration is still bickering . But Interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees ) to Reston . And the Department of Housing and Urban Development gave Simon a research grant of $200,000 to see if he could build really low-cost housing by using the factory methods of the trailer industry . I attended a Reston citizen 's meeting the evening this grant was announced . It would all turn out for the best , Simon reassured the new homeowners . Presumably the black , low-income people would not crowd in on them . His caginess made the Restonians present angry . They welcomed the prospect of integration they told Simon in no uncertain terms . That night I was persuaded that new towns could work in America . Still , the houses did n't sell as fast as they should have , the construction program lagged . In part this was due to the newness of the place . Who wants to be a pioneer ? In part it was due to the tight money market . In part it was due to the expense . Reston 's outstanding design and special amenities added as much as $3,000 to each house . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend perhaps $1,000 more for these extras , but not $3,000 . " Yet , in the end , as of a month ago , what was built did sell ? the best designed houses too percent , the others about 8o percent . The difficulty was that not enough could be built . The investment capital , the " patient money " was lacking . Sales slowed close to a standstill because Reston could not promise any firm delivery dates . Simon made strenuous efforts to raise more money . He called on about 20 potential investors , and some of them came in and made elaborate surveys and financial feasibility studies . They only proved what Simon had told them all along , namely that Reston is no get-rich-quick scheme like hoola-hoops . Washington Gas Light Co. reportedly promised $6-million and then backed out of the oral deal . An even bigger company , General Electric , which had let it be known that it was interested in new towns , I am told , got all set to move in with substantial cash . GE executive wives already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final , decisive meeting , one of GE 's board members spoke up . He objected to Simon 's hope that Negroes would be living in Reston . GE , it seems , wants unanimous consensus . Simon would n't back down . So GE backed out . At about this point Gulf Oil got worried about its $15 million investment and staged its putsch . At first Simon was " promoted " to chairman of the board . A real estate consultant , named Robert H. Ryan , was installed as president " to save Reston . " Ryan moved swiftly . He stalled the press on all news of what was happening while he purged muchof the professional staff Simon had painstakingly assembled and fired Reston 's master planners , the brilliant architectural firm Conklin and Rossant . Then , a month later , all smiles and conviviality , Ryan entertained newsmen . To begin with , he called the $37 million investment in Reston a $45 million " debt , " whose carrying charges kept him awake at night worrying . Then he proceeded to destroy confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , waving an unlit cigar , is ahead of its time . He did not say that since Reston pioneered the idea every major project in the Washington area has taken it up . Contemporary architecture , , he continued , does not attract buyers . He did not say that virtually all of Reston 's architecturally most acclaimed houses were already sold to satisfied owners . As to mixing income groups , Ryan also voiced his doubts . " I just do n't know , " he declared . " The American ethic for zoo years has been for income levels to live with their own kind . " But he affirmed his faith in planned communities : " I am obsessed with the conviction that sound planning and economic feasibility do go together . " And he reiterated time and again : " We will stick to Reston 's original master plan . " Signs have appeared in Reston 's administrative offices which read : " Creating Value Is the Name of the Game . " To those of us present who learned later that master planner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound hollow . Only The Wall Street Journal gloated that Reston was " about to be yanked abruptly back to earth . " Most everyone else fears that Reston will soon be en-Gulfed in mediocre urban sprawl , as was Radburn , New Jersey , the Greenbelt Towns of the New Deal and several other noble attempts to build good communities in this country . For Gulf Oil , said Ryan , will henceforth " listen to the market . " The trouble with that , as an angry Reston resident put it , " is that until 1492 the market said that the earth was flat . " All Ryan 's marketing survey computers can tell him is to follow the trend ? the trend that has led to where we are and that has been aptly described as " the mess that is man-made America . " We had hoped that our big corporations would help start a new trend and lead us out of the urban mess . Perhaps they stilt will . Reston , which Gulf Oil has said it never wanted to end up owning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin . It should be far easier to put up the " patient money " needed for a new town than the risky " brave money " needed to rebuild the slums as the " urban coalitions " of big business , politicians and civil rights leaders now promise to do . Meanwhile , however , USIA had better hide that handsome exhibit in Belgrade .
