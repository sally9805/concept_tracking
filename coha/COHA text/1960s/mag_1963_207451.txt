A whole generation has grown up since William Powell was a matinee idol noted for his sophisticated suavity in The Thin Man , The Great Ziegfeld and My Man Godfrey . Many of today 's moviegoers scarcely know him . But less surprising than his fading reputation is the actor 's actual survival . Last week in Palm Springs , Calif. , Powell observed the 25th anniversary of his operation for cancer of the rectum . And with the same smooth ease that made him a hit on the screen , Powell spoke frankly of an illness and a treatment that most patients and their relatives find too embarrassing to discuss . <P> " I began bleeding from the rectum in March of 1938 , " he said . " The doctor found a cancer , smaller than the nail of your little finger , between three and four inches up inside my rectum . They recommended removal of the rectum . Then I 'd have had to have a colostomy and evacuate into a pouch , through an artificial opening , for the rest of my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the doctors said that for my particular case they could offer an alternative-a temporary colostomy and radiation treatment . I took it . " <P> Surgeons made an incision in Powell 's abdomen , brought out part of the colon , and cut it halfway through . " From then on , " said Powell , " fecal matter went no farther than this opening in my abdomen , and emptied into a pouch attached around my middle . " <P> With the lower colon inactivated , surgeons removed the cancer . Apparently it had not spread . As a further precaution , Radiologist Orville Meland of the Los Angeles Tumor Institute implanted platinum needles containing tiny radium pellets . " For the next six months we simply waited , " Powell recalls . " I had a lot of examinations but led a reasonably normal life . I did quite a few radio shows , though I could n't make movies . The worst thing about the situation was the esthetics of it . " <P> After six months , with the cancer apparently eradicated , the surgeons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them originally , and he has had normal body functions ever since . As late as 1955 , he played in Mister Roberts . <P> Few cases of rectal cancer are detected early enough to be treated as Powell 's was . If the disease is widespread , the only hope is removal of the rectum . Says Powell simply : " I was one of the lucky ones . "
