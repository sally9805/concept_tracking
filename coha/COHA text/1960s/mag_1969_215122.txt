IN THIS HOUSE OF BREDE by Rumer Godden. 376 pages . Viking . $6.95 . <P> <P> Novels about nuns , even if the holy ladies drive Jeeps and play baseball , have a hard time making it . When the nuns are members of a contemplative order , the outlook is bleak indeed . Yet this chronicle of 15 years in an English monastery is an immensely readable book , partly because the way of life detailed here proves as exotic and medieval as Cosa Nostra society , partly because the story moves briskly forward , with only a few lapses into melodrama . <P> The story centers on the erratic spiritual progress of Dame Philippa , a widow who enters Brede at age 42 after a successful career as a British government officer . At least half a dozen more biographies are told with quiet humor and occasionally painful intimacy . Moreover , the order is beset by a fiscal crisis , which is solved when a scapular cross cracks open revealing a ruby as big as the Ritz . Miss Godden 's stylistic triumph is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office and the liturgical year . She lived at England 's Stanbrook Benedictine monastery while writing the book , and has translated her observations of life there into a quiet celebration of reverence .
