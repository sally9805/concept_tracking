Early one morning last week , 6,000 Breton farmers descended on the little town of Pontivy . They blocked the highways , then rode some 1,000 tractors into town in a wild , angry snake dance . They closed in on the local administrative building , painted its gates with manure . When the police arrived , the farmers pelted them with rotten eggs .

De Gaulle took advantage of the Brittany disturbances to remind his Common Market partners and their highly protected farmers that agricultural trade barriers among the Six must be reduced as fast as industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
