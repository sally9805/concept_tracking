There was once a sultan with a harem of jealous wives . Being a wise man , the sultan secretly gave to each wife a blue bead . When they sought proof of his affection , he would say , " I love the one who has the blue bead . " Thus he was able to live happily ever after . <P> In Washington last week , both Turkey 's Premier Ismet Inn , 79 , and Greece 's Premier George Papandreou , 76 , wondered just who had President Lyndon Johnson 's blue bead . They had come separately to the White House after the Cyprus crisis hotted up early this month when Turkey prepared to invade the island rather than allow enosis-the union of Greece and Cyprus . Putting his prestige as an international mediator on the line , Johnson conferred first with Inn . A wizened , wily little old man , Inn tried to enlist U.S. support for the Turkish plan to partition Cyprus , and had no basic objection to Johnson 's suggestion that the Greeks and Turks settle their differences in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Greece 's Papandreou , who bluntly rejected a proposed meeting with Inn , and implied that U.S. interference in the dispute was only marginally useful in view of the United Nations ' mediation efforts . Stung by this response , State Department officials let it be known that they sympathized with the Turks ' plight , and hinted that Washington might no longer be able to prevent a Turkish invasion of Cyprus , which would almost certainly precipitate war with Greece . <P> As both leaders headed for home , it was obvious that Johnson 's mediation effort had failed . During his New York stopover , Turkey 's , Inn commented that nothing could be settled about Cyprus " until the U.S. takes a stand " for either one side or the other . But rather than risk choosing between two NATO partners , the U.S. quickly returned the Cyprus hot potato to the U.N. , which recently voted to continue its peace-keeping operation on the island for an additional three months .                 @ @ @ @
