" The secret 's out , Stan , " Sidone said . " Moonbloom 's on tous . " All right , " Norman said with some impatience . " I know you have to practice , but you could practice during the earlier evening . Some of the other tenants . .. " " Say no more , Moonbloom , " Sidone cried . " I know your problem .

Norman sat in the howling , writing out the receipt . Katz handed him the money , and Norman took it from him without expression , quite able to bear the mad volume of laughter . But then he was struck by the odd lack of smile on Katz 's face ; Katz looked naked and almost helpless without it . There was the feeling of conspiracy , as though he had crept around into Norman 's hiding place and sat down there with him . " We 'll try to be more quiet , " he said under the cover of his friend 's wild laughing . Norman stared at him , wondering what he saw . And then Katz 's lazy-looking tromp l'oeil smile was there again and the small barb of curiosity was cut off from the surface and left lodged in Norman . In the hallway he heard the brief refrain of the trumpet playing the traditional bullfight theme , a machine-gun riffle on a drum , and then silence . The back of Norman 's neckp21began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bell . " I still do n't know why you have to collect the rent every week , " Carol Hauser complained . The Hausers were new tenants . Her husband , Sherman , hissed by habit . " Well it is a damn crazy thing , " she said , turning her carefullywrought head to him . " Like a rooming house . I mean , this is an elevator apartment . It 's ridiculous . " " The man told you all about it before we took the place . What are you bitching about it now for ? " Sherman ground the words to small pieces and fed them to her . Large and bony , with heavy horn-rimmed glasses , his hair meticulously pompadoured , he had the look of someone ready for sudden death and concerned that it find him at his best . The girly magazine he had been looking at earlier lay in the crevice between the chair cushion and the arm . " What do you have to keep on for ? " " I 'm talking to him . " She moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  why cash instead of a check ? It 's inconvenient . " Even though she faced Norman , she seemed to be speaking to Sherman . Indeed , both of them ignored the agent ; he was merely the catalyst that evoked their perversely pleasurablebitterness . Norman accepted the fact and kept his eyes fixed on the artificial fireplace with its artificial birch logs glowing in a red-bulb fire . " He told you in the beginning . It 's their business . The rent was reasonable , there was nothing under the table . You were happy enough to get it . Now you have to keep asking dumb questions . " " Ca n't I open my mouth without . . . " " Ah , crap . "  | " Animal , " she snarled , keeping her pudgy face and Du Barry hairdo absolutely still . She wore a beaded dress and high heels ; with her thick , plump body , she seemed dressed for some pornographic purpose . The lamp shade had a device that gave the effect of a river flowing . Norman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the lamp shade was real enough to put out the red-bulb fire . " Well pay him , for Christ sake , " Sherman said . " Why do n't you ? " " Because you have the goddamn money and you know it . " " It is n't necessary to use that gutter language . " " Hah ! " " What do you mean , ' bah ' ? " " I mean you 've heard worse . " " And what is that supposed to mean ? " she said , welcoming savagery . Norman stood like stone , half hoping he would be taken for an artificial figure in the room with artificial fire and water . He held his breath as the man and woman leaned redly toward each other . And then the child came in , all blond and gold in Doctor Dentons , blue-eyed , shapely , beautiful . Slowly , Norman let out his breath , wondering whether the small boy could be an even more cleverly made artifact . " I want ice cream , " it said convincingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed another octave . His homely , groomed face dissolved to reveal a particularlyintense ugliness . Carol fussed with the shining yellow-white hair , her heavy lips slack with a febrile delight . " Bobby wash his face ? " she said with babyish enunciation . " I do n't wan na . I want ice cream , a whole bunch . "  |p23Norman  had the uneasy feeling it was a real child . He cleared his throat , surprised to find real phlegm . " Oh yes , " she said , walking toward the doorway to another room . " Sherman , wipe his nose . " For a second Norman thought she referred to him and he quickly pulled out his handkerchief . But Sherman dabbed at the boy 's nose and Norman put his own handkerchief back . He laid the receipt on the leather-topped , gold-bordered table next to a china swan . The mother , father , and child were hooked up now , their circuit temporarily completed . Grouped next to the revolving river of the lamp shade , they could have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the little boy , they could not see Norman , and the last thing he noticed before leaving was the man 's hand , creeping with animal accuracy up toward the woman 's buttocks , and the woman smiling with unconscious lust while the child stood between them in drowsy boredom . As he went down the stairs for his last two calls , he noticed that the window was dull with night . Like a blackboard , it waited for something to be inscribed upon it . Gradually , tediously , he was working toward his own time . Tomorrow he would take care of Mott Street and Second Avenue , and the next day Thirteenth Street . Only two more tonight , and then darkness and the vague lazy corral of his freedom . He shu lied and almost tripped over a raised tile . He raised his feet more carefully until he was before the door of the Lublins . He pushed the button and wondered whether the buzz he heard was a signal to them or something that existed only within his own head . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americanin feature or stature . Their children , a boy and a girl , had been vitaminized into somewhat better color . The roomp24was neat , slightly dowdy ; it had the air of having been furnishedaccording to the taste of several other people , as though decor were something the Lublins paid no attention to . " The kitchen sink drips , Mr. Moonbloom . " Sarah Lublin 's tone was hardly one of complaint . She might have been commentingon the climate  --  something you really could do nothing about . Her face was so full of character that she ignored it . She had a large , rather hooked nose , full , wide lips , deepsocketedeyes of a sort of Wedgwood blue , and clear , smooth skin . " It keeps me awake , " she said . " I wait for the next drip , I hold my breath and wait . " Her husband , Aaron , had similar skin , faintly yellowed , and his hair was black and false looking , combed flat to his skull . He sat with the girl and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an impersonal reverence . He shrugged at Norman , asking for tolerance for a woman 's foolishness . " When my head is on the pillow , there is nothing , " he said . " No drips , no creaks , nothing . I learned to sleep , long ago , as though there might not be time to again . Women can not be that way . They are curious beyond everything else . It kills them to think that they might miss something . She must know if it will drip one more time , one more time . Even if it kills them , they must know . " Sarah 's slight smile stayed on one side of her mouth . " The way he sleeps . . . before even he touches the pillow  --  in midair . " A washer it needs perhaps ? " Aaron touched the large-faced girl 's ear as though looking for something . " I 'll send the superintendent to take a look , " Norman said , idly watching Aaron 's hand , half consciously waiting for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the forearm.  | " What superintendent ? " Aaron said , his sarcasm as bland as his wife 's complaint . " He 's got a lot to do , " Norman answered . " He takes care of three other buildings . " " I have never seen him , not once , " Aaron said , his voice just that much lighter in tone to indicate what was probably humor for him . " He is like a myth to me . There are rumors of him ; I see ash cans on the sidewalk . Once in a great while there is evidence of someone having washed the hallway . But the actual man  --  never . " " One superintendent for four buildings ? " Sarah said , countingout the rent money with fingers that appeared sensitive to the feel of currency . " It 's an economic problem , " Norman explained smilingly . " We 're practically a nonprofit organization . " Aaron smiled slightly as he recognized deceit . His arm rested on the arm of the chair . Norman lip-read silently , 3241179 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the receipt is always for less than we pay , " Sarah said mildly . Norman smiled a little chidingly . " The rent is reason-able ? " " No complaints , " Aaron said quickly , his alacrity indicatingan old , well-developed talent for self-humiliation . " We are merely having conversation . " " I understand , " Norman said , putting the money into his wallet . The girl got off Aaron 's knee and went into another room . The boy , more delicately built , waited a discreet minute to assert his independence , then followed her . Aaron watched them go with hard , vigilant eyes . Sarah watched him watch/ing them . Her arm was white and unmarked and yet Norman sensed numbers there too . " We 'll see what we can do about that faucet . " Norman stood in his large , dusty-looking blue suit . " I 'll make a special note of it . " " Yes , a note , " Aaron said , and went to check on the children , who were too quiet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get more rest . " She looked at Norman intimately . The furniture was their own , yet the place looked like a furnished room . Even the family photograph on the dark , clubfooted table had the quality of a hotel-room reproduction . There were things that Norman did not want to know . " Good night , " he said . " Yes , sure , " the woman answered . The Spragues threatened him with that drowsiness he had felt with Arnold and Betty Jacoby , though less dangerously . Had he been actually less tired , he might have been amused by them . Instead , he felt a kind of vertigo . Jane had huge , semiconscious eyes and irrelevantly voluptuouslips . Each time she moved and noticed her pregnant body , she expressed faintly annoyed surprise . " He wants the rent , Janey , " Jim Sprague said in a bewilderedway . He had a lean , Lincolnesque face , and every word he uttered seemed like the beginning of a maze . " The rent ! " she exclaimed . Jim frowned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Epstein ? " he said . " Moonbloom , " Norman corrected , sitting down . " Epstein is the delicatessen man , " Jane explained , sitting with a ball of yarn . " Have a drink ? " Jim asked  | " I 'll have a glass of water , if you do n't mind , " Norman said . " Sure thing . Janey , what do you want ? " " A teeny bit of Scotch , " she answered . Jim nodded and went into the kitchen , where he clinked and poured and bumped around . Jane smiled at Norman , and he smiled back . Jim stuck his head around the doorframe . " What was yours again , Mr. Moonbloom ? " " Water , " Norman said . " Just water . " Norman and Jane tried a dozen different smiles while they waited . Occasionally she made gestures he could n't understand . Jim came out with three glasses and set them on a table across the room . Then he sat down . For a moment he studied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correction , got up and brought the glasses back . He gave the amber-colored drink to Norman , the plain water to his wife . Norman did n't bother to correct him . " Jim is in dental mechanics , " Jane said , licking her luscious mouth . Jim agreed with a solemn nod . There was too much silence . Finally Jim sat forward with an intensely interested expression . " Just what can I do for you , Mr. Moonbloom ? " " The rent , " Norman said , afraid to speak too loudly . " Oh , of course . " Jim chuckled and sat back . The two of them laughed politely and did nothing . " I 'll make out a receipt , " Norman coaxed . " Oh Jim , the money , " she said . Jim went into the other room and came out with some bills in his hand . Norman took the paper clip off , handed back the post card from Capri , and put the money away in his wallet . Neither of them said good night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the post card ; Jane was gazing at her swollen belly , trying to recall how in the world it had come to be there . Norman closed the door quietly , afraid to alarm them . Gaylord was studying the ash cans in the cellar , and when he heard Norman , he put on his Caliban expression . His round , clever face became slack and oppressed , his eyebrows brooded . " With my back , " he said sadly , kicking at the heavy can . " It 's a crime , but what can I do ? I never learned a decent trade , never had no advantages . I 'm a hewer of wood , I accept my lot . " " I 'll help you with them , " Norman said . " Do n't overact . " " What do you know of the black man 's burden ? " Gaylord said contemptuously . " I share it , " Norman answered sourly , lifting his side of the heavy can . " And you think any of them give a man any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the ceiling , above which all the tenants boiled in their strange elements . " Hall ! Not them . Just , This leaks , this broke , that broke . ' All they got to say to a man is Do ! ' " " A lot of doing you do , " Norman said . " You 're too busy phi-losophizing . " " See , you too . You got no gratitude either . " " I 'm an ingrate , " Norman said . They went up and down the cellar steps a dozen times with the heavy cans , grunting together , coughing occasionally from the stirred-up dust of the ashes . A well-dressed man and woman looked curiously at them as they walked out to the sidewalk , joined to the heavy can , their outer arms extended . Norman was particularly strange to them , his oversized fedorap29square on his head , dwarfing his delicate face , his dark suit and neatly tied tie making him look like a picture in someone'sattic . Together , with their flapping arms and grim hold on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Icarian dream . Sweat and effort silenced and joined them . They hefted and groaned , and favored each other on the steps . The last can made Norman 's legs tremble , and he dropped it so heavily that a cloud of ashes rose into the cool air . They stood for a few minutes , catching their breath beside the squad of ash cans , looking at the city night . " Smell like fall all right , " Gaylord said . " Smell like apples . " " It 's October , " Norman said . " Even in the city you can tell . " " Stars gettin ' clearer , " Gaylord observed , scanning the building-jabbedheavens . " The air is better , " Norman said . " Breathe better , " Gaylord qualified . " Autumn , " Norman said in a long , weary voice . Then they parted without farewell , and Norman went through the city to where he lived.  |p30HE  STEPPED INTO his own apartment , and his deep , relieving sigh was that of a man to whom hermitage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was prone to guilt pains , had claimed many times that the reason for Norman 's failure , the causes for the blandness in Norman 's relations with people , stemmed from a love of being alone . Norman , divesting himself of his large , dusty clothes and running the hot water in the tub , would n't have argued the point . He did n't know why he was the way he was . His passions had always been dim to him . As a child he had seemed to be mostly happy . He had daydreamed a lot , conventionally romantic daydreams . He still did . The stretching inside himself had seemed like ordinary growth until his manhood , and after that had puzzled him somewhat . Now , of course , he sensed the imminence of pain but could not imagine how it would affect his personality . He got into the tub and ran a little cold water . Then he lowered his thin , hairy body into the just-right warmth and stared at the interstices between the tiles . Sadness  --  he had experiencedthat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thought of it as the return from each thrust of happiness . Lazily soaping himself , he gave examples . When he was five and Irwin eight , their father had breezed into town with a snowstorm and come to see them where they lived with their grandparents in the small Connecticut city.  |p31Their  father had been a vagabond salesman and was considered a bum by people who should know . But he had come into the closed , heated house with all the gimcrack and untouchablejunk behind glass and he had smelled of cold air and had had snow in his curly black hair . He had raved about the world he lived in , while the old people , his father and mother , had clucked sadly in the shadows . And then he had wakened the boys in the night and forced them out into the yard to worship the swirling wet flakes , to dance around with their hands joined , shrieking at the snow-laden branches . Later , they had gone in to sleep with hearts slowly returning to bearable beatings . Great flowering things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resonance of the wild man 's voice had squeezed a sweet , tart juice through his heart . But then he had wakened to a gray day with his father gone and the world walking gingerly over the somber crust of deadlookingsnow . It had taken him some time to get back to his usual equanimity . He slid down in the warm , foamy water until just his face and his knobby white knees were exposed . Once he had read Wuthering Heights over a weekend and gone to school susceptible to any heroine , only to have the girl who sat in front of him , whom he had admired for some months , emit a loud fart which had murdered him in a small way and kept him from speaking a word to anyone the whole week following . He had laughed at a very funny joke about a Negro when Irwin told it at a party , and then the following day had seen some white men lightly kicking a Negro man in the pants , and temporarily he had questioned laughter altogether . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man Axelrod and had found only curves and credits . He had become drunk on the idea of God and found only theology . He had risen several times on the subtlep32and powerful wings of lust , expectant of magnificence , achieving only discharge . A few times he had extended friendship with palpitating hope , only to find that no one quite knew what he had in mind . His solitude now was the result of his metabolism , that constant breathing in of joy and exhalationof sadness . He had come to take shallower breaths , and the two had become mercifully mixed into melancholy contentment . He wondered how pain would breach that low-level strength . " I 'm a small man of definite limitations , " he declared to himself , and relaxed in the admission . He dried himself with towels stamped with the name of a hotel his brother had owned for several months . Dry and warm in pajamas and an ancient flannel bathrobe , he went into his kitchenette and opened a can of chili . He heated it in a saucepan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm clock ticked in competition with the silently efficient electric clock on the wall . Dimly there came the sound of the traffic on Lexington Avenue , four floors below . He hummed and kept out the larger din of remembered voices . The spicy smell of the chili pricked his nose . But suddenly his humming oppressed him . He felt an unusual self-disgust , which puzzled him , and as he ate with the newspaper opened before him , he pushed down the faint disturbance . When he washed the pot and the dish , he had an image of himself , thin , dark , idiotically placid , sealed into a hermetic globe whose thinness gave him only the flickering colors of the outside . For a while he browsed through the books on his shelves . There were the remains of his many pursuits : books on Hebrewtheology , textbooks on the anatomy of the human foot , orthodontic techniques , an illustrated history of Byzantine art , collections of English poetry , an anthology of twentieth-centuryshort stories . He decided on a soporific . Pulling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bed and opened randomlyto the chapter on the Metatarsus . Buses and cars bleated , honked , and roared , with subdued violence ; occasionally a human voice rose almost to his window , then fell back down without quite reaching him . And all of it was like silence to him . Though his home city had been small , he was a city boy from way back and he remembered his crying out " What 's that ? " at the bursts of silence when he had lived in the country . When he was drowsy enough , he switched off the light and automatically turned into his daydream , which had to do with his father . He knew this was not his real dream , just as he knew his real dream was something obscure that he neverthelessfelt was deep and profound and often confused with the beating of his heart . No , the favorite fantasy was only another soporific , one that parted the curtains of sleep for him . Like a boy 's night story , it made him smile in the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and imagined the world as his playground . As usual , it got him to sleep . But all night long he seemed aware of the din and sensed familiar voices . One tiny crack appeared in his shell , and he wore himself out trying to patch it . In the morning he was very tired and did n't look forward to the day at all.  |p34THANK  GOD FOR a day like this ! Even Mott Street was bearable in the clear , liquid air . The dingy grocery shops , the vegetable stand with its overflow of crates and scattered greens , the gutterswedged with paper and orange peels , even the crowding , crooked , narrow buildings , all had a rather exotic appearance in morning sunlight and shadow . Doorways were intriguing , and the air moved lightly over the shoulders of mothers wheeling their children and their groceries . Norman almost was convinced he might get through the day . He turned into the turtle-green building and walked past the rubbish cans and the abandoned , one-wheeled stroller , and began the climb . Basellecci was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good morning , Mr. Moonbloom . A lovely morning , is it not ? " His colorless , fleshy face and curly gray hair , his sober hazel eyes behind glasses , combined to give him a look of extraordinary moderation . He beckoned Norman in out of the reeking hallway to where he had roasted the air with freshly ground coffee . " I am about to begin my brake-fast . You will perhaps have with me some good Italian coffee ? I find it to be the most beneficial for the stow-mack after sleep . " " It smells good , " Norman said , sitting in the cramped kitchen . Unfortunately his chair faced the little closet where the toilet was . With its heavy , wooden water tank above it , it looked like a seat in a torture chamber . On one side of it ,  |p35the  wall bulged dangerously , like an enormous contusion ; it looked as though a great body of water were pushing at the wall , and Norman imagined Basellecci sitting on the toilet with his pants down and the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is my  --  how you say ?  --  pick-it-up : I must have my pot with me wherever I go . One must have some remmanant of graciousness , no ? Here , it is the instant coffee , or the mud from unwashed tanks . I have transported my pot from Firenze to Cleveland , from Cleveland to Detroit , from Detroit to here . " He fussed happily with cups and saucers . " I have several pots , like changes of clothes . They are of various sizes , of copper , pewter , alumimumum . Coffee is my vice . Harmless enough ? " " Perfectly , " Norman answered , admiring the cleanliness of the apartment in a building so impregnated with filth . Basellecci poured delicately , raising and lowering the pot so the steaming brown stream flexed in air . " Coffee , " he said with a sigh of benediction . " Mmm-mm , " Norman said appreciatively as he sipped the roasty liquid that fulfilled the promise of its odor . He kept his eyes away from the terrible toilet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Some prefer with milk in the morning , but not I. Oh , sometimes in the evening I will add a drop of Strega or anisette , but normally . . . " " And how does your teaching go ? " Norman sat back and slowly drew the receipt book out of his pocket . " Ah , grazie , bene , bene . Only that some of them , my studenti , do not work , they are sloppy . I do not know why some of them even come . They have no care , they pronounce  --  terrible ! They have no respect for the way a word is made . A word , after all , has shape , texture , yes ? Italian is a lovely tongue if it is spoken . They come , these second- and third/generation Italians , to  --  how you say ?  --  brush up . Ah ! Such tongues , such dialects , such accents ! From Bari , their parents came  --  their Italian sounds like Chinese . Or Sicilians with barnyard accents . I say , Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you never heard of it and come fresh to learn correctly . ' No grr-ratzy  --  grahtseeayy , grah-tsee-ayy . " Basellecci held his fingers aloft , curled in vowel love . His voice rang harshly . With the coffee cup in one hand , the other hand shaping his passion , he was between his sacred and his profaneloves , and his neuter face was as near luminescence as it could ever be . " Leem-pehr-may-AH-bee-lay . .. " He looked tenderly at Norman , as though asking him to match such beauty . " Raincoat , " he said modestly . " The language of Dante , " Norman said in payment for the coffee . " Ahh , " Basellecci sighed , shaking his head reverently . Norman cleared his throat and took out his pen . Basellecci came off his cloud , feet first . He peered guardedly into the snap-top purse he had produced from his pocket , " What about the wall ? " he said , changing their relationship back to what it was . Norman got up and walked over to the toilet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implying that there might be something unreasonable in the complaint . He forced himself to press the swollen wall . It was soft and faintly damp ; he repressed a gag . " Well , I do n't know .... " " I am constipated all the time , " Basellecci cried angrily . " I sit there and watch that terrible swelling . I can not relax . My sphincter is paralyzed with dread . Soon I will grow genuinelysick , and then I will sue in a court of law . You must attend to it ! " " It 's an old building , Mr. Basellecci . However , I 'll look into it . " - Look into , look into ! What is to look into ? There it is  --  onep37does not need twenty-twenty eyesight to see it . Go , try it yourself ; close the door and sit there . See if you are capable of a movement ! " " All right , Mr. Basellecci , do n't get excited , " he said . The scalp around each hair of his head rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his pants down . " I 'll have someone up to look at it . " " I will sue for mental anguish as well as medical expense ! " " No , no , we 'll take care of it . Just relax . " This was the wrong word , he realized , grimacing with regret . " RELAx ! How can I relax ? My sphincter is paralyzed , I tell you . I ask little . I know it is a humble house . I am a humble man . I do not expect a doorman , an elevator , air conditioning , wall-to-wall carpets . I am equipped to do battle with vermin , I do not complain that only one window opens or that only one burner works on the stove . I am used to lighting candles for light in my bedroom . But I can not , can not go on this way . My system is already poisoned . I am cemented in . I must have relief ! " " Yes , certainly , Mr. Basellecci , I understand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Leave it to me . " Norman backed out , nodding . " And thank you for the coffee . You do n't have to worry , believe me . ... " Over and over he expressed his assurances , his regrets , his concern , his compassion , his thanks . He barely stopped nodding before the next apartment door opened . " Wung , " he said to the young Chinese , bracing himself as always for contradiction . " Whatta ya say , man , how 's the world treatin ' ya ? " But his face was dynastic ; his eyes were Orientally calm . The low , curving contours of a North Chinese face with that voice made it seem that a Ming vase had been wired for sound . " Like man , I 'm gaffed  --  nowhere . These Village types deject me . Come in , come in . Oh but I 'm hung over with talk ! Ya-ta-ta , Ya-ta-ta . Ip38mean , ca n't these pigs just lie down and do it ? " He looped an arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer cans , lingerie , and newspapers . " Park it while I take a reading , Pops . I 'm spinnin ' . " But he had hands like those Eastern painters who could twist out a bird with a single manipulation of a brush . Norman sat down with the memory of the girl who had betrayed him with a fart . " I 've got a lot to do , " he said from the edge of the malodorous couch . " I know , man . But just let me work my way back . I mean it was almost blotto last night . She talked and talked . By the time I got her to a supine position , I almost did n't care . " " L'amour , " Norman said , writing out the receipt . " Oh , I tell you ! You should have heard this chick . I feel the Oriental splendor of your hooded eyes . You are the East , eternally patient . ' Patient ? Man , I was beside myself ! " " The rent , Wung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the shirt came off here , then we wrastled past the bathroom , " Wung said . He snapped his fingers . " Yeah , the tub , I left my jeans in the tub . " He darted away and came back with a soggy wallet from which he produced soggy currency . " It 's all coming back to me , " he groaned , dropping down on a chair with his head in his hands . " Oh man , where am I going ? " " It 's the spin of the world , " Norman consoled indifferently . " See you next week . " Jerry Wung got up and bowed deeply from the waist . " Like arrivederci , most honorable Moonbloom , " he said . " Like Shalom , " Norman answered , returning his bow . Beeler , the retired pharmacist , had never had his own store , and his face was a silvery constant shrug . His bald pate led Norman into the room , whose furnishings had been the lastp39word in 1924 . His armchair was tubular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grooves . Turning , he motioned Norman to sit on a tortured ottoman . Then he sat himself with a grunt and stared at Norman , a cigarette smolderingbetween his lips , the smoke closing one of his lightblueeyes . " Sheryl , " he called , without turning his gaze from Norman . " Pay the man , " he said to the big blonde young woman who looked in from the doorway . " The toilet does n't flush , " she said , running her eyes over Norman with dance-hall selectivity . She wore a silk kimono with a dragon embroidered and straining under the weight of full , slack breasts ; it had been her mother 's kimono , and seemed exotic to her because she still recalled her mother 's secretive freedoms . She came into the room with a slow , heavy walk and bent over her father to kiss his bald head , her arm across her chest to keep her breasts from swinging . " Totinka , " Beeler said tenderly , plucking out his cigarette but keeping his eyes on Norman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Norman said over the receiptbook . Knowing that Beeler was watching him , and knowing that there was no worth-while reason for looking at the big , fleshy form , Norman nevertheless found his eyelids pullingagainst their lowering . It was like telling someone to stand in a corner and not think of a white rhinoceros . He had to look up at the bulging dragon . Sheryl smiled . " I 'd appreciate , " she said . " A girl kind of depends on the john , you know . " Norman licked his lips and remembered that his life of continence could result in a congested prostate . " Of course , " he croaked . He cleared his throat . " Of course , " he said more clearly . " This is my Baby Girl , " Beeler said , pointing first over hisp40shoulder to the big blonde woman , then moving the bony pointer toward a silver-framed photograph of a fat little girl with Shirley Temple curls . " She has n't changed , has she ? " " Not a hair , " Norman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little defiantly at him . She turned and walked out of the room , letting Norman see the breadth of her hips and the faint declivity of the silk over her buttocks . " An angel , that child , " Beeler said , lighting another cigarette and setting it between his lips to torture his eye again . " You should have seen how her mother dressed her . Pink dresses , big bows , all starched . People used to stop and stare . My wife loved it . " Norman got out when the old man turned his blue , indecipherableeyes toward the photograph . As he closed the front door , he heard Sheryl singing the blues in the bathroom , her voice off key and coarse . Kram was immaculate , and his apartment had the sterile look of a laboratory . A cylinder of compressed air stood beside his drawing table , upon which lay the delicate , dragonfly shape of an airbrush and the photograph he had been retouching , a picture of a goddess in a foam-rubber bra . The hump on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precise and certain were his gestures and his voice and his clear , dark eyes , that Norman often felt Kram was shaped correctly and other human beings , himself included , were mutations . He handed Norman the money , his clear face unencumberedby any desire . " Any complaints ? " Norman asked confidently , noting the exactitude of spacing in the man 's thin combed hair and the clean shine of his glasses , which did not have the faintest speck of dust on them . " No complaints , " Kram said , with the slightest shadow of ap41smile . He was a man used to sleeping on his side and to the impossibility of perpetuating anything . " Everything is as it should be . " " " I think you 're the only person I know who has no com-plaints . " Kram chuckled softly . " I used them up long ago , " he said . " There 's nothing can happen to me , good or bad . " He motionedNorman over to the drawing table where the brassiered goddess smiled indefinitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brushes and tacks and hard pencils were arrayed like surgical instruments . " You see what things are ? They are flat and poor and they require my skill to have even a semblance of substance . You should see what she was before I doctored her up . Her skin was like a sponge , her neck was full of tendons , her breasts were so shallow that they did n't cast any shadows . Everything . Pictures of food come to me looking like garbage , and I make them look good enough to eat . Kids who look like little angels in the magazines  --  I take the snot out of their noses , the pimples from their cheeks ; I make the glaze in their eyes look like a dewy shine . It 's interestingwork , is n't it ? " " It seems to have disillusioned you . " " On the contrary , " Kram said with a smile . " I was disillusionedbefore I came to this profession . Retouching has restoredme , though in a different way . " " Well , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangely , a little humor left in his eyes . " I do n't think so , " he said . " I think you 're a different case alto-gether . " Norman looked at him , wondering at the inward shudder this caused . Then he smiled , because there really was nothing between them , and with a little wave he left the hunchback in his immaculate apartment.  |p42Norman  chewed the wadded paper that ketchup and onion defined as hamburger . Around him was the ground-up conversationof people on their lunch hour , interspersed with the clacking of thick plates and thin metal , and commanded by the cries of the short-order cook and the countermen as they called out abbreviated orders . " BLT . Burn one . Grade-A shoot . Lemme have a number three , light on the mayo . . . Norman sat amid the grease smells and the nerve-racking clatter , not at all deluded into thinking he was being nourished . But he was used to the terror of those luncheonettes where people swallowed mouthfuls whole , their eyes bulging , their mouths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out of it , or had never been in it ; an invisible placenta allowed him to move at his own speed . His stomach was used to food prepared for mass lack of taste . By lifelong habit , he heard but did not listen , just as he saw but did not look . Like a cautious mouse in an electrified maze , he remembered his few tentative sorties toward things , his few brief adventures into the barest hint of pain . He kept to a small circumference now , having experienced nothing that compensated for the discomfort of sensation . When he asked himself what his life meant , his invariable answer was , evasively , " It does n't mean anything ; it is " And ding , the act was consummated , his change flung down on a spiky rubber mat . He took a book of free matches for evidence that he had been there . Out in the sharp sunlight , people were too numerous to notice , bits of face and wool . He belched up the condiments and the onion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat taste . For an after-lunch treat , he breathed the warmed , autumn air and thought about the fact that leaves were color/ing someplace , and that the browned apple core in the litter basket had filled with juice on a real tree . There was no longingin his thoughts , only the condescending amusement of a man who allows no credibility to dreams except during a time set aside for dreaming . " I 'm not more than half alive , " he thought cheerfully , never considering that the state of being fully alive might be impending . " God forbid , " he would have said to that suggestion , not believing in God or the threat . The four-family house on Second Avenue was the " best " of the four buildings he managed . He looked at its narrow , brownstone facade with an almost boyish smugness . Now , thirty-three years on his way toward wherever it was human beings ended , he was " working " at gainful employment for the first time , and he savored the idea of it , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlit cigarette . Wade Johnson opened his door and grinned dangerously , his hard , meaty , good-looking face searching for outrage . Normansaid , " It 's me , " and flinched in anticipation . " Come on in , Norman , you little Jew prick , " Wade said lovingly . He was as thick-muscled as a stevedore , and his blue eyes were always just a flame width from either rage or merriment . With the treacherously gentle touch of a cat on a stunned bird , he took Norman 's arm and led him into the apartment , which was walled with books . " Sit down and listen to that Limey Eliot , listen , " he said ferociously , shoving Normaninto a chair . " ... OnlyThere is shadow under this red rock , ( Come in under the shadow of this red rock ) , And I will show you something different from either Your shadow at morning sliding behind youOr your shadow at evening rising to meet you ; I will show you fear in a handful of dust . " P44He kicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hah ! " " ' The Wasteland , " ' Norman said . " I did a paper on Eliot at Michigan ; no , no , I think it was when I was up at Bow-doin . " " Paper , paper , never mind the goddamned paper . Hear it , man , hear it ! You and your goddamned papers ! " He leaned over Norman , smelling of rye whisky . " ' I will show you fear in a handful of dust , ' " he snarled into Norman 's ear . " Shit , Norman , do n't start jabbering about your papers ! " " Such language for a schoolteacher , " Norman said tensely . " And with your kid sitting right there . " He gestured toward the tender-faced blond boy who sat on a bench , smiling sweetly . Wade guffawed . " Teacher , who 's a teacher ? They do n't want teachers ; they want titties , wet nurses . They want people to chew up everything until it 's a pasty gop and then push it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poppies grow , between the crosses , row on row .. : That 's what they want , those c s . Or , I think that I shall never see , a poem lovely as a tree . ' They 're like you ; they want things that fit neatly on paper . Could I put darkness and light right there in the classroom with their hygienic little souls ? Could I say : ... I flung her onto a basket of cushions and sailcloth in a dark corner . And I remembered nothing but her white drawers trimmed with lace . " Then , 0 despair ! The wall became dimly the shadow of trees , and I was plunged in the amorous sadness of the night . " He held Norman in the wake of his voice , grinning sadisticallyin the afternoon sunlight that churned up around him in dust motes . Finally he shook his head in mock despair . " No , no , it 's no use ; you 're still on paper , Norman . You live in a dream , you know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amused . " And how about you with your raving ? What do you call that ? " " Hey , but I feel pain , I 'm full of sensation . I 've got an idea that you could watch a murder committed and just smile your goofy little shit-eating smile . You 're like a body under water , you know that ? Yeah , Moonbloom , that 's the image , a goddamnedHebrew body wrapped in water . When you talkglub , glub , bubble , bubble . " He pushed Norman back into the chair when he tried to get up . Norman laughed helplessly and shrugged . " Aw come on , Wade , I 'm a workingman , " he said . " Never mind that , " Wade answered . " I 'm not through with you . I sit here spending my Saturdays correcting the toilet paper my students hand in , and the spring winds tighter and tighter . I drink and try not to yell at little Wade Junior , here . And then a pair of big Jewish ears comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to the smiling child , who gazed at his father adoringly . " Wade Junior , pal , be a good Joe and fill up another juice glass with Daddy 's whisky . There 's a good fella . ... " He turned back to Norman , his eyes glittering . " Do not go gently into that good night , Old age should burn and rave at end of day ; Rage , rage against the dying of the light ... " It took Norman a half-hour to get away , and at the door Wade said plaintively , " How do I get these bastards at school to let me really teach ? I 've been thrown out of five schools and quit two more . And why , why ? " " Because you 're a bum teacher , " Norman said tauntingly from a safe distance down the hall . " I 'm a great teacher ! " Wade howled , his eyes red and laughingand mad . " I could get kids to feel with every square inch , I could get them to love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , " Norman called back , going up the stairs ,  |p46relieved  to be away from the wildman , his relief a purely physical , mindless thing . " You skinny Jewess 's get , you circumcised Uriah Heep ! You know , you know damn well . . . . " His voice echoed through the corridors and in the stair well , and then was detonated by his door slamming . " Hi , Norman , " she said , the breath behind her voice either natural or learned , but natural now . She opened the door wide , smiling with her rich mouth closed . Her dark eyes were huge and beautiful , as is frequently the case with hyperthyroid , nearsighted people . Norman remembered drawings of the eye in cross section and went inside , his only apparent thought beingthat somehow his coming for the rent got him in there but that his entry made the one door seem like the back door . " Leni , " he said , his hand over his heart , as though in avowal ; really he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're so regular , " she said . " My son Richard 's school hours and you  --  the only constants in my life . " " How 's everything ? " Little rivulets washed against him  --  not that he felt anything for her , but if he had been tempted to . . . He saw all the things that kept her from being pretty : coarse black hair , a little too thin at the front of the center parting , skin just on the drab side and vaguely rough , little crow's-feet leading from her eyes to thirty . She had a broad face , and her rather square , slightly jutting jaw gave her mouth a slightly savage look . Then , too , her teeth were n't anything to write home about and her . . . " Hope this is n't a bad time for you . " " Oh , I do n't know the good times from the bad times . No , I 'm not doing anything important . Reading a script for a microscopic part in a microscopic play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her smile purposely covered her imperfectp47teeth , and yet it brought out her abundant reality . " Do you think I 'll make a good ingenue , Norman ? Am I young and willowyenough ? " She held her hands out in girlish gesture , her hips wide , her waist short and not too slim , her breasts full and past their early resiliency . The side of her slacks gaped to show a tiny patch of faded pink . " Could I pass for eighteen ? " Norman chuckled uncomfortably . " Well you 're wrong . I could . You 're as young as you feel , arf , arf . I 'm a professional ingenue . I do n't look young enough , but I have the ability to prroe-ject . The limitation of parts is due to . . . Well , perhaps because that 's the only thing I can feel strongly , a desire to be in my teens , indefinitely . " " And how 's Richard ? " he asked , sitting on the plastic armchair . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent . She grinned and flung herself down on the couch with one leg under her . " Oh that kid  --  he 's a Method actor . Like mother ... He 's so convincing . I ca n't do a thing with him . The thing is , he wants a father without my having a man . Oh yes , I have problems . " " You were going with a young engineer , if I 'm not mistaken ? " " You 're not mistaken , Norman , I was , " she said wearily . " Another dead soldier ? " " Oh , you know ... " Norman knew . In the nine months that he had been making these rounds , she had indicated relationships with five men . Relations . He shifted dimly . There was quiet except for the sound of her son 's pet white mouse scratching in his cage in the bedroom . Arrested with his hand in his breast pocket Napoleonically , he imbibed his slow , steady nourishment . He saw her pale full neck as she rested her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breasts , heavy in theirp48rise and fall . Slowly , passively , he turned over and over , used to his own pulsing silence . From where he was , she was just weight and warmth . " I tell you , Normy , I get low and tired . I feel like dropping the Muse and this kooky life and marrying a nice tired busi-nessman . " " Oh , you 'll probably meet some fascinating man and get your name up in lights , " he said . She laughed . " I do n't remember ever thinking about that . As a kid I play-acted because I lived in a gloomy house with old parents . Now I 'm just addicted to grease paint . Besides , I ca n't type or sell dresses , and it would n't be nice for Richard if I sold my body . " Norman said nothing , and she heard him . She looked at him quizzically for a moment . " And what about you , Moonbloom , what 's with you ? " " Oh me , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most educated rent collector . I 'm trying to make what I 'm stuck with into a vocation . " " Somehow you seem too good for your job , " she said . " It would be the first thing I was too good for . Maybe that 's what people should do , something they 're too good for . " " I do n't quite make you out , Norman , " she said suspiciously . " Either you 're some kind of a sneak or else . . . I almost get the impression that you 're sleeping . " He smiled , ignoring the odd scratching sensation that he sensed , rather than felt , in his chest . " Okay , take your rent and go before you distract me . I have enough things already .... " " I 'll give you a receipt . " " You know what you can do with that receipt , " she said , escorting him to the door , her sweet smell just getting throughp49to him . He looked at the wide white part in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " So long , Moonbloom , " she said in her breathless voice . It boomed profoundly and came through the deepness to his subterranean dwelling . He rolled restlessly and blood flowed warningly . J. T. came to the door and made a tired , gentle gesture of welcome . " It 's Moonbloom , " he croaked , and then coughed a little ; the phlegmy , shredding sound established his identity . He was tall and gaunt and bent , and the painter 's colic was drawing him into an ever more acute curve , like an invisible bowstring ; you sensed what the release would be . " Will you please sit down , J. T. , " his wife said , and then , to Norman , " That man just has to pop up every time the bell rings . Sure do n't have to worry about this fella , J. T. ; he would n't get discouraged and go away , would you ? " " No , Mrs. Leopold , you 're right about that , " Norman said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put together all my chicken feed . " She led him into the living room , which was papered in ancient brown stripes . There was a glass-shaded lamp , circa 1911 . Norman vaguely recalled seeing such lamps used cleverly in pictures of modern rooms . But here , surrounded by massive , clubfooted tables and highboys , it was being played straight , and the reds and blues of the lamp shade were part of the consistent picture from a dusty , old , commonplacealbum . She rummaged in a pocketbook as big as a small shopping bag and covered with some sort of coral oilcloth , talking as she squinted at what she was ostensibly doing . " J. T. feels that the hallway ought to be swept out once in a while , " Milly Leopold said . Suddenly she made a silent " ah " and plucked out a wrinkled bill . " Is n't that right , J. T. , honey ? " She smiled , pretending to be animated by the gaunt , blue-faced man with the heavy 1890 mustache . J. T. did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his smile . " And another thing J. T. would like to know is when you 're going to take care of that busted burner on our stove . He 's getting mighty impatient , are n't you , J. T. ? " J. T. wrinkled his face . Impatience ? " No , it does n't do to arouse J. T. He 's gentle and soft-spoken but you das n't push him too far . Pushed too far , J. T. coughed cavernously . The sound of splintering wood came from his chest , vague , buried leakings . Milly was briefly frozen by the sound ; her eyes stared , and her smile became somewhat dimmer . She watched her husband'slarge , cracked-nailed hand grope over a book with numb , blind flexings . J. T. picked up the book and opened it at random ; then he stared over the top of the book at the rug , as though convinced he had removed himself sufficiently by that act . " The best thing would be to take care of those things , " she said somewhat distractedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unbelievable way of grandmothers in children 's books . She wore septagonal , rimless glasses and had curly gray hair combed to account for each silvery strand . Everythingabout her appearance was naive , except her eyes , which remembered everything despite her prettying effort . " I 'll have to get after the super , " Norman said , decorously addressing the old painter . He eased the money from her hand and put the receipt into it . " The stove too . " She barely nodded , though she maintained her smile . The coughing had smashed something in her ; patiently , she fitted the shards together and swept up the pieces too small to bep51saved . She stood when Norman started for the door , looking to see what effect that had on her husband . But J. T. merely stared at the diminishing light of afternoon with a quiet rage ; handsome in an old barroom way , he was bluish and perplexed looking . " Well , " she said with a deep breath at the door , " you look into those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitedmeans  --  as you may know , I go to business myself , and Mr. Leopold is only eligible for minimum Social Security . The rent is a serious problem for us , and we certainly expect to get all that 's coming to us . Now that burner has been broken since . . . well , my son , Carl , was here from Michigan in July  --  he 's in TV repair out there  --  and the burner went on the blink then . Now that 's , let 's see . . . " She counted on her fingers , her eyes strained in a ridiculous attempt at concentration . The rumbling cough sounded softly in the apartment , and her counted fingers turned arthritic . " That 's a good four months , and I 've been after that colored fella a million times , and he just keeps telling me all the work he has with four houses , and I say well what about me and I 'm a darn sight older than you and I manage to . . . " She talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slid away from her , nodding and moving his lips agreeably. use Moeller was an astringent termination to the Second Avenue tour of duty . Pretty , sourly smiling , she looked at Norman as she looked at everyone ; she seemed to feel herself to be an ugly mold and saw all people as her castings . " Here he iss , " she said with nasty humor . " Fire , famine , flood , nutting stops the rent . So constant , my , my . " " Perhaps it 's reassuring ? " She ignored that , turning her back to him to get the money . She was shapely , but her arms were almost grotesquely toop52long and seemed to drag at her shoulders . " Do you not ever think beyond the rent ? Does it not occur to you , little rent man , that the vorld is killing itself and that the bomb vill soon turn all money to ashes ? " " Sometimes it occurs to me , " he answered pleasantly , his face too small and battened down for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you keep working and somehow things go on . " " You evade like a coward . Or perhaps you do n't like talking to me ? " Her smile was scornful and knowing and bored . " What a thing to say , " he answered , holding out her receiptwith an incorruptible smile . He approved of her immaculateapartment , which would have stood up to Kram 's standards . Only , the hunchback 's eyes were coldly serene , while hers were harsh and disorderly . " You do n't like Chermans , do you ? " she said , her smile bitten into her good-looking , rather blotchy face . She held on to one end of the money , so he was forced to remain face to face with her . He raised his eyebrows , in a kind of surprise that his face expressed anything . " I mean , you are a Jew . . . " Oh , that ! " He chuckled at her misapprehension . " No , no , that 's silly . Why should I hold anything against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That possibility exists . " " Agh . " She let go of the money and waved him off . " All right , go , go . You must excuse me . I have things to do . I must vash my hair , " she said with a little gesture of mock daintiness . " I have a date for this eefning . I must be a cute , pretty little doll baby , so female , so stupid . Then the man vill like me and perhaps buy me a dinner another time . Ve vill dance and drink and then wrestle for a while in the hallway here , and Ip53vill cutely refuse him to come in , hinting that maybe next time . . . So , that iss vat iss between me and my sleep to-night . " " Have a good time , " he called over his shoulder without thinking . " Stupid fool ! " she said , and slammed the door . He shrugged and went out of the building with all the money . Outside , Gaylord was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facade . " Got a lot to do in that place , " he said dolefully . " Do n't hardly know where to begin . " Orange sunlight gave convictionto his strong figure and dignity to his broad , dissatisfied face . " Just study the situation for a few days , " Norman said withoutstopping , wary of Gaylord 's trapping him into manual labor . " Oh you go ahead and mock . " " Do n't be so sensitive . I 'm not mocking . " " Nobody knows . " " Bye , Gaylord . " He waved with a snapping motion of his wrist . " Go on , go on . I 'll take care of it myself . " " Good man , Gaylord , " he called back from too far away to be caught . The early dark began blotting the color of things as he walked down Thirteenth Street . Small , fly-specked luncheonettesalternated with wholesalers who dealt in narrowly specializeditems . Here were costumes dusty and dated , there a place that was established in 1907 and specialized in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlet for doll 's eyes  --  Only to the Trade . The street seemed to be avoided by the Depart/ment of Sanitation in memory of a forgotten feud , but the dirt there was not particularly repugnant , seeming to consist mostly of paper . The buildings , above the tawdry shop fronts , were noble in their antique cornices and dark green , scaly paint , and yet , taken all together , the street presented the gritty complexity of a broken rock . Norman smiled slightly as he walked , wondering whether or not the street depressed him . His doubt recalled Ilse 's name-calling , and he tried to define to himself what , exactly , a fool was . The house was squeezed breathless by two huge warehouses , and some of the windows showed the strain in quite apparent warping . As Second Avenue could be described as the " best " house of the four , so this one was obviously the worst . " Today , the ground floor smelled of bananas . " Karloff , " he said , wrinkling his nose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come . " Vas vilst du ? " The roar had a startling echo . " Moonbloom , the rent . " No echo at all . " Gay in draird ! " The door was flung open to reveal the mountainous ancient . " Now , now , Mr. Karloff . " The man , still over six feet tall , was being tugged downwardin a thousand places . It was as though a multitude of hooks tied to weights were snagged in the outer corners of his eyelids , in the flesh of his cheeks and the corners of his mouth , at his shoulders , his ear lobes , his temples . It gave him the look of a gigantic , extinct creature thrusting upward from the frozen mud . His skin was almost black with age and crumpled into so many short , intersecting lines that squinting slightly one would not see them at all . " Vas vilst du mit mir ? Ich hut nit kein gelt . Ich hut gornisht ,  |p55gornisht  ! " His carnivorous breath was bearable only because of the accompanying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you tell me that all the time . But I know better . You have money . Why , you eat enough for a whole family . You spend four dollars a day for schnapps . You 're richer than I am . " " Ich nit vershtayen , " Karloff rasped in feigned bewilderment . " You understand fine . " Norman slipped past the great hulk and went to the table , upon which were strewn pieces of bread and scraps of meat . A torn loaf stood beside a half-empty bottle of whisky . Roaches took their time on the walls , and the curtains were in tatters . The walls were so filthy and old and of such indescribable color that they seemed like recesses of murky air and made credible the echoing bellow Norman had heard from the hallway . On the hamstrung bed and the crippled , leaning buffet , there were broken-spined books with Yiddish type , and pieces of a Jewish newspaper were stained by fish heads . Under a cracked , filthy bowl of cold soup , Norman was surprised to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he removed the bowl and opened the book ; it , too , was printed in Yiddish . He looked up at Karloff , visualizing an Ahab condemned by fate to live too long . " How 's the book ? " " Ah , zayer goot , " Karloff said , smiling to show the black stumps in his ravenous mouth . Disarmed , he fell into English . " It is story fuhn a fish , a graysa , big ... " " A whale , " Norman said helpfully , rubbing his fingers together in request for the money . " Yah , yah , a vale . And the menchen , the kepten . . . he has a dybbuk , ehr gehven mashuga fuhn duh vale . And the sea ... " He waved his long , heavy arms , and his dark , rottingp56face shone with great excitment . He was one hundred and four years old , and his remaining strength was in his rage . His children were dead , and Norman had seen his youngest grandchild , a silvery-haired man already troubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty calls . Karloff consumedvast quantities of food and drink , had a vile temper , and claimed to be the oldest atheist in the world . " The rent , " Norman prodded . " Such a meissen , " the old man mused , stuffing a ragged chunk of bread into his mouth . " And Mr. Karloff . . . " The black face looked at him blandly . " For the dozenth time , I 'm going to have to ask you to keep the place a little cleaner . We keep having the exterminator , but it 's a losing battle . You must not leave garbage around . People complain . " " Ah shwartz cholerya off en zie  --  ahlamun ! " " No need to curse . I 'll have to insist . " " Yah , yah , " Karloff said scornfully . " Go already . " " The money , Mr. K. " " Nah ! " He pushed the crumpled money at Norman , obviouslyhaving had it in his hand all the time . " Take , take . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hah ! Not me , not Karloff ! I am strong , Ich hut kayach , Karloff hut graysa kayach ! I do n't die , I do n't die ! " He beat his huge , collapsed rib cage ; standing in the filth of his room , he was like a gigantic , tatteredplant grown from a compost heap . " G0wAN , co ! " He howled . Norman went . Sugarman paid him in small bills and a multitude of change taken from his previous night 's candy sales . He was a candyp57butcher on trains going out of Grand Central , quite widely remembered by passengers for his entertaining manner of hawking his goods . Yet , like most clowns , he was at heart a dolorous person , resigned to predetermined fate . With no humor discernible , he had told Norman that his name had doomed him to his trade . " Come in and get it , Moonbloom , " he said . He was in his late forties and had a curly , florid face and a strong , thick body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a face at the small change . This half-dollar , for example . It changed trains at Peoria and again at Chicago . It took the milk run downstate to Cairo and was carried back up to Sandusky , Ohio , in a whore 's garter belt . Quickly it lost the brief warmth of that intimate purse when she put it into a collection basket in a Catholic church there . A kindly felon in the audience took it in change for a zinc slug and transported it across two state lines to Utica , New York , where it changed hands in a game of jacks-or-better , draw poker , one-eyed jacks wild . The bean salesman who won it brought it home to Albany , where it went into his wife 's pin money . She bought her boy friend a hand-painted tie with it , and the store rolled it with others of its kind and deposited it in the Third National and Mineral Savings Bank . The following day it was in a teller 's **32;4031;TOOLONG envelope . This man , a sufferer from Reynaud 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit to his father in New London , Connecticut , where he paid for a tankful of Esso premium gas with it . The servicestationowner then took the New Haven Railroad to New York , leaving New London at seven oh three Eastern standard time . At precisely eight forty-eight , same time zone , he paid for a bar of Hershey 's chocolate ( nutless ) . I know the time because an air hose broke and we were stalled near Cos Cob . " He satp58down on his bed and looked at the patient little man with the receipt book . " And still it does n't come to rest . It goes to Moonbloom , and I will not know its destiny hereinafter . " " I 'll take good care of it , Sugarman , " Norman said , writing out the fictitious receipt . " No , no , you wo n't , " Sugarman said sadly , the Pagliacci grief and self-disrespect coating his eyes . " You have somethinginnately unwholesome about you , Moonbloom . In spite of all your busy handling of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a basic disregard even for money . Like me , you are essentially humorless and unalive . " " How can you call yourself humorless , Sugarman ? You 're known as the wit of the rails . " " I only cry out in the darkness as we rush through the countryside , " Sugarman said , laying himself on his bed . " My jokes are merely wails ; my sounds of humor are cumulatively a dirge . Hey , do n't I know  --  humor is tragic ; it sinks the knife far deeper than solemnity . The laugh is as elemental as a baby 's gas smile , a reflex of pain . " " You 're very eloquent , Sugarman , " Norman said , as willing to kill time one way as another . He was near the end of his collections , and the evening ahead was just a long , embryonic period of time . As far as he could tell , he derived the same pleasure , or sensation , from this as he did from the coin-inducedfoot vibrator he had used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your calling out of excess concern about your name ? " " No , absolutely not . My shoulders , my spirit even , are shaped to the strap of my candy tray as my father 's arm and spirit were shaped to the phylacteries . I was born with my spiel and at an early age shocked my father out of his morning devotions with my heretic and profane cries . Last call for candy , ice-cold awrange drrink , peanuts , ham and cheesep59sandwiches , chocolate bars  --  male and female , chewing gum , delectable cookies . This train does not have a diner , ladies and gents . There will be no refreshments between here and Boston . You will be famished , parched , and debilitated . This is your last chance to nourish your bodies , to replenish the vital juices lost to sweat . These awrange drrinks remain cold for extraordinary lengths of time due to a special ingredient . There is positively no dining car on this train . I am your last hope for sustenance . Hersheys , Almond Joys , Milky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice your professional standing , giving me that performance . I definitely will not buy . " " True , true , but what can I do ? It 's all busman 's holiday for me . I 'm like a sailor with eternal sea legs . I rock in my bed and wake in the dark expecting to see Bridgeport or New Haven floating past in the night like memories . There is no present for me . I am all past . I have spent my youth no place , in transit . I am a wraith , Moonbloom , I doubt my existence . When I enter a room , it is as though someone had just left . I have no social life , no friends . For sex I use women as I would a vending machine . All recedes from me , as though seen through the window of a train , and I see faces as I see the fronts of buildings in the hundreds of hamlets I pass , all overlainwith my own ugly puss . " " Obviously you 're lonely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thirty-five Club ? " " You are being deliberately cynical . Nothing reaches you but vague premonitions . " " Maybe some time we 'll go into it further , " Norman said as tedium suddenly began rising up over his ankles . He stood and put his money in order . Sugarman stared at the ceiling . " Moonbloom , " he said spitefully , " your clothes are too large for your body . "  | " Noo-o , Sugarman , I 'm too small for my clothes . " " You are no help . " " Not even to myself , " Norman agreed , reaching the door . " This house is cruddy , " Sugarman said petulantly . " No question . " " Everything is cruddy . " " Now , now , Sugarman . " " I 'm tired , Moonbloom . After I talk for a protracted time , I get weary unto death . Go , let me dream of that last big train of them all . " " Sounds Freudian , " Norman said , opening the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish you well , " Norman said . And he closed the door on the figure of the candy butcher , lying diagonally across his bed , his eyelids down and fluttering . As usual , Paxton seemed busy . He let Norman in with a little feminine gesture of irritation . " Oh heavens , you agayn . " He smoked like one of those machines that supposedly test cigarette filters , but his black face was knobby and calm , removed from the nervous gestures of his hands and shoulders . " Well , come on in , baby , but I am in a sort of tizzy . " A Dazor lamp stood poised over his typewriter ; beyond , the disorder seemed hostile to his attempt at work . The room looked frenzied . There were papers all around , and there was the feeling that the inhabitant of the room could not live without paper , that he was an odd species of creature who could be nourished by nothing else . Books did splits on the battered bed ; magazines were piled against the walls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept off some magazines and envelopes , and waved an invitation to Normanto sit.  | " I 'll be out of your way in a minute , Joe , " Norman said , lowering himself cautiously on the uncertain seat . " Oh , that 's all right , love . I 'm so disorganized anyhow . And je suis fatigue ; I need a break . Have a drink , Norm ? " " A little soda , maybe ? " " Soda , soda , " Paxton said , contemplating the debris and scratching his tightly grown hair with a delicate finger . He kept it cut short and did nothing to beautify it , using no grease or lotions . His mouth was classically thick , but his nose betrayedsome forgotten Caucasian in the woodpile and was long and sharp . His eyes were globular and moved very rapidly . " I just might have some kind of flat quinine water . " " Make it water . " Paxton filled a jelly jar at the sink and dropped into it a melted-down wafer of ice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handing the glass to Norman , " that old word-machine is a monkey on my back . Sometimes I do n't know why I bang away on it . I do n't even think about what is going onto paper and to my agent , penultimately to the publisher and ultimately to the ladies in the book clubs . It begins to seem as though I could just go on and on without even having a ribbon in the typewriter . The act of striking keys becomes the be-all end-all . I 've just got to get out of this room soon or  --  bughouse ! " " How 's this one coming ? " Norman asked , receipt book in hand . " Oh , tres bien , but I 'll get to hate it before I 'm done . I 'm rotting inside , lovey  --  it ruins everything . I start with hating the White Citizens Councils and begin hating citizens and wind up hating yours truly . Lamentable , but not hopeless . " He looked at Norman with his prominent eyes , which struck out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead and the smallness of his other features , sop62that his face was like an onrushing vehicle , its way lit by the eyes . " I 'm just waiting for a royalty check , and then , adieu Thirteenth Street , adieu United States of Some Americans . I go to Paris , where the squalor is rosy , where mold is precious . " " Then you think one place is different from another ? I 've never been as far away as Europe , but I 've had my head on the pillows of several states , not to mention six months at the University of Mexico and a summer session at McGill . The light was the same everywhere , and everywhere I displaced the same small amount of air . " " You , Norman , are an extraordinary case , not typical of Homo sapiens . They say elephants gestate for God knows how long . Without intending insult , let me say that I believe your sainted mother must have been a mastodon . The gook is still in your eyes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritation . " I get a little tired of hearing people say that I 'm in a fog . I think it 's just misery loving company . No one can stand to see tran-quillity . " " As you say , " Paxton said with a shrug . " Anyhow , " Norman went on , mollified easily because his angers were never more than a few inches high , " you apparentlydo n't like it here . " " Like ? Man , I 'm just tired of Niggerdom . I 'm small and frail , Dad , small and frail . I can no longer stand to look at my brethren ; they haunt me . I 'm an artist  --  they need preachersand warriors . Joyce left home so he could see what he was doing . Lord knows , I 've got more reason . " Norman digested that , sipping slowly at the water , which tasted of rust . Those pipes ! On the mantel of the dummy fireplace were Paxton 's three published books , literary successesall ; but they had earned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the first had come out . Norman turned his eyes on the slight , black man , who seemed to be burning away in the clouds of his ferocious smoking . " Maybe you should get married , Joe , " Norman said innocently . " Wow , that would be a truly spiritual thing  --  no confusion with lust there . Oh , baby , I like women , but that would be a perverted relationship . I 'm a wholesome American faggot , lover ; at least that part of me is somewhat orderly . That 's all I 'd need to louse myself up  --  a touch of bisexuality . Why , I 'd never get any work done . " " Just so you 're happy , Joe , " Norman said , writing out the receipt . " You 're so wry , baby . I 'll bet you 're the wryest landlord in town . " " I 'm only the agent , " Norman said softly . " Man , if I had time , I 'd like to take you apart and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly face suddenly metamorphosed by an incredibly beautiful smile . That smile was the secret of his charm ; it seemed to forgive so much , that the beholder was forced to forgive him . " You have the makings of something , something .. . . " Black man speak with forked tongue , " Norman said , handingover the receipt with one hand , the other out for the money . " Do n't be surprised if one day you open a Paris Review and see yourself flayed and pegged out in print . " " I 'll look forward , Joe . " " Take a traveler 's check ? " Paxton asked , the flawless , warmingsmile fixed hypnotically on Norman . " For you , Joe . "  | " Merci , cheri . " " You 're welcome , Yussel . " And they parted , somehow both friends and enemies . Del Rio studied drama on the nights he did n't fight . You could see the complexity of his regimen in the way he looked at you from under the battered folds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " Hullo , Moonbloom , " Del Rio said , somewhat Marlon Brando in tone ; but his swarthy face , thickening under the small jabs of ring opponents ( he was a good boxer and rarely absorbed heavier punches ) seemed to Norman on its way out of eligibility for the lover roles . Of medium height and superbly built , he moved lightly , guardedly . At a hundred and thirty-eight , Norman felt ponderous , and he sat quickly . The room was very clean and almostanonymous except for the several books and notebooks . The picture of John Barrymore on the wall looked like something that had come with the room . A red satin robe with DEL RIO in white lettering on its back hung on a hanger on the door to the closet . On the table an open book was guarded by a tall jar of wheat germ . " There 's cockroaches again , " Del Rio said , taking his wallet from a drawer . " I 'm getting fed up . I have to use that lousy can in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out myself every other day . I buy disinfectant and do the tub and the sink and the floor and the goddam toilet bowl . I sweep out the hallway on this floor and I keep my room clean . But I do n't have a chance with those stinking cockroaches ! " " I spoke to the old man . " " Spoke ! Get him the hell out of here . Put him in a home for the aged or something . He 's extinct , that old nut . I swear I 'm going to call the Department of Sanitation or the Boardp65of Health ! " His Indian-black hair picked blue lights out of the approaching dusk , and his face , which had seemed phlegmaticunder its armoring of scar tissue , was stirred now by an odd-flavored anger , almost a passion ; he might have been expressing a perverse love for that which provoked him . " He 's a human being , " Norman said mildly , almost flippantly . He felt much safer with Del Rio than he did , say , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone outside the ring . " Well , so am I ! I ca n't stand filth . Besides , anyone who lives dirty like that is an animal , not a human . " " He 's old , " Norman said , filling out the receipt . " I ca n't see how people can be so sloppy with themselves  --  their bodies and their minds . They 're messy all the way through , " Del Rio said with a twitch of disgust . " Not all of us have your discipline , Del Rio , " Norman said , waving the receipt , although he knew the ball-point writing dried almost upon contact with the paper . He thought wistfullyhow pleasant it must have been to write with a quill and then pour sand over the parchment . " That 's why the world is so messed up . " " Because we do n't wash enough ? Come on , Del Rio  --  the Germans are an immaculate race . " " " Inside they 're messy , they 're full of filthy fairy tales . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how can you be an actor if you ca n't identify with all us untidy humans ? " Del Rio flushed like a prepubescent boy accused of having a girl friend . " That 's something else again , " he said harshly . " An actor can be like a scientist . When he performs , he is conductingan experiment . It 's like he 's using his voice and body as a microscope . I mean , I could even play that old maniac Karloff , probably . But I 'm always me . A scientist does n't have to identify with some gloppy tissue he 's studying . "  | " Well , I do n't know , " Noinian said , feigning thoughtfulness ; he was playing an old , mild game with Del Rio . " It does n't seem you could be much of an actor that way . " " You 're wrong , " Del Rio said intensely . " The passion should be for the craft , not for the subjects . It 's like what I do in the ring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight well . But if I stay cool and watch everything I do and everything the other guy does , I come out fine . " " I would n't imagine you 'd have many friends with your attitude , " Norman said , counting the money slowly and arrangingit in his wallet in order of denomination . " Big deal . I used to have friends and family . They loused me up plenty . I 'm better off now . " " Never lonely ? " Norman asked , his pregnant-woman eyes faintly teasing . " Always lonely , " Del Rio said proudly , his lean , perfect body a testimonial to his ascetic triumph . " I 'm not convinced , " Norman said . " That does n't matter to me , " Del Rio answered calmly . " The thing is , I can always understand my pain  --  everything is clear to me . " " Maybe you wo n't always be so strong , " Norman said , standingand wondering why he bothered with all the talk . He suddenly felt very tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous evening must still be in him . For a moment he felt an idiotic panic at the possibility of something incurable , but it was gone with as little aftereffect as a single heart palpitation , and he smiled at Del Rio . " I 'll see what can be done about the roaches , " he said . " Do that , " the fighter said , standing in the bright loneliness of his room . " I ca n't stand dirt . " " Only dirt ? " Norman sighed with the faintest irony . " Do n't laugh at me. "  | " Is that another thing that bothers you ? " Norman asked from the doorway . " All right , all right , " Del Rio said impatiently . " Look , I 've got some reading to do and I want to catch a little sleep  --  got a fight in Newark tonight . " " I 'm going , I 'm going , " Norman said in mock panic . " See you next time . " Del Rio did n't answer . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frame on a picture of the fighter , sitting at his table over the book , his large knuckled hands laced over his forehead , completely motionless as he read . His immobility made apparent the furtive movement of a roach on the molding over his head . Norman grimaced emphaticallyfor the insect 's danger as he closed the door with a little click . Louie , a Jewish gnome , lived under the roof . " Hi ya , Norman , whatta ya say ? Hey , nice day out , hah ? Suppose to be fifty-five degrees , but I do n't know .... " He was a messenger for a photoprint company and he had large photostats of farm scenes on his wall . There was a small televisionset with a screen the size of a playing card , a twoburnerstove , and a large store of canned foods . Often he was happy . But Norman had seen him lying on his bed with a corner of the pillow in his mouth , frightened and ill looking . " But I got this sore shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bursitis .... You think they care , down to Delmore Photo , that my shoulder hurts . Nall , whatta they care ! One of these days I 'm gon na walk out on them . I 'm not fooling . Oh , I had a offer from Scarpo , over on Eleventh Avenue  --  pay three bucks more too . I said , Well I 'll see . ' You think Delmore appreciates I 'm loyal ? Hah ! " Norman nodded his way in and took his receipt book outp68for the last time that week . A Western was crepitating softly on television ; Louie 's canned supper bubbled cosily on the little stove . " Think I 'm gon na go out by my sister 's next week . She 's got a house out to Longuylin  --  Massapeeka . Think I 'll go out there and sit in the sun there . She got a pretty yard and kids . The kids call me Uncle Louie.  --  He chuckled meltingly . " Them kids ! I bring ' em out balloons or candy , cheez ... . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . " Norman wondered if Louie talked to himself when no one else was available . The words came out so fast and irrelevant to sensible response that only nodding and smiling were possible . He nodded and smiled at the little man . Louie was fifty-one years old , but his hair was still all black and combed flat to his monkey head like gleaming skin . His ears were simian too , and he had a large nose and small dun-colored eyes . " I 'm gon na catch that picture down to the Apollo . It 's about this monster from the North Pole . Manucci , fella what I work with , seen it . Says the monster comes to New York and knocks over buildings and they bomb him and all . Supposed to be very interesting . I do n't know though  --  I think maybe I need glasses a little . . . . " He rested his hand on his nose . " But anyhow , next week I 'll run out by my sister , I think . Yeah , visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while they go out dancing and like that . It 's nice there , big house  --  Early Colonial split . She keeps a special bed for me in the playroom , foam-rubber mattress . She 's a good cook , my sister . And they like for me to come out . Uncle Louie , ' they call me  --  ahh-hhh . . . . " He shook his head wonderingly . Norman slipped into his wallet the money that Louie had had waiting on the table . He wedged the receipt under Louie 's floral plate and stood up.  | " Ah , but them guys over Delmore  --  wise guys , they make fun , you know ? Smart guys , mock me  --  hah ha ha . Some time I 'm gon na . . . " His face darkened and twisted , weird emptinesses rolled behind his eyes for a moment . Then his dullness laved him . He squinted at his supper boiling , and looked blankly at the Western , which faded into a commercial for cocoa before his eyes . " Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Apollo . Manucci says that monster is bigger as the Empire State . I do n't know though  --  I think I need glasses a little . .. . Norman left unobtrusively , while Louie was talking . He walked through the evening streets to the subway at Fourteenth Street . The sky arched into superfluous immensitiesof distance ; for Norman , the distance between him and the nearest passer-by was infinite . He felt dull and weary . There was a ringing in his ears that he attributed to a " bug " that must have attacked him the previous evening , and he defended the pulling , pushing sensation in his body , diagnosinga low fever and focusing on his perfect abode some concrete miles ahead . He looked forward to the comfort of doctoring himself . The wind , which had been autumnal during the day , now had the cold , death-damp smell of winter . He could n't go around without a coat any more  --  this treacherous , changeable weather . He mused on the possibility of **26;4065;TOOLONG clothing that would keep one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drunk vomit hideously , although he passed within a foot of him and was splashed slightly . When he got home , he put a pot of water to boil for a spaghetti supper and sat down with pencil and paper to recalculate the things that should , but which he knew could not , be done . And each time , as he prepared to write thatp70which seemed to require first priority in his fictitious plan , another face appeared to him and he remembered another complaint . The sisters Minna and Eva reminded him of the elevator ; he tried to recall whether it was an Otis or a Westinghouse . The Lublins ' dripping sink plunked into his consciousnesswith its irritating persistence . Merely a washer .. . But the pencil was arrested at the point by the swelling tumor of Basellecci 's wall . And then there was J. T. Leopold 's stove and the wiring on Second Avenue . . . . The slow crawl of a doomed cockroach made a distracting track across his mind . Leni Cass leaned into his eyes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complaint ? He got up with a hiss of exasperation , dropped the spaghetti into the boiling water , and stood watching it soften and slide down limply into the pot . He was feverish ; there was no sense trying to think straight . He set the timer at nine minutes and wandered over to the window , brushing absently at imagined lint on his trousers . Suddenly he caught sight of an unexplained stain on his pant leg . He bent down and scraped at it , imagining a foul smell . Straightening , he stared through the window , trying to relive the time , to pinpoint the moment when that filth could have touched him . And staring vacantly at the buildingsoutside , his lucidity impaired by the low-level fever , he imagined he saw the Monster from the North Pole looming over the skyscrapers downtown.  |p71THE  FEVER PUZZLED and intrigued him . He sat in his little office , the phone held a few inches away from his ear to mute Gaylord 's aggrieved shouting , examining the sensation of fragility . His limbs could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of discomfort , pain seemed imminent . His skin felt susceptible  --  there was the ghostly sense of knowing pain without feeling it . The closest he could come to an example was the silent statement , " My hair hurts . " " ' Got no pressure , ' they yell to me , got no pressure . ' " Gaylord brayed from the phone . " What am I suppose to do ? Top floor they got no water at all , rest of the house just a trickle , like a baby peeing . I say , I 'm no plumber , got to call the agent . ' They say , Well do something , ' all mad at me , like I took their water away . I get the brunt , they pick on me , probally figure him , that swarsa , he 's to blame . You better get on over here , Moonbloom , get this straighten out ' fore I lose my temper and tell them times change , slavery gone out , man got to be treat with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaylord . Take it easy , I 'll call the plumber . " Sensitive  --  the word made the tiny hairs on his forehead stand up . He gave a slight shudder at the thought of bumping his arm against something hard . " Sure , you 're there , you say , Take it easy . ' You come herep72and get abused like I get abused , see if you take it easy . No water , no water '  --  you think they dying of thirst middle of the desert . I 'm going over Thirteenth Street ; got plenty to do . I 'm not about to stand here and listen ... . " All right , Gaylord , all right . " He hung up , and put his hand to his head to check his temperature ; but he could feel neither his hand nor his head . Before him , the letters on the window were haloed by the noon light. " tnegA , " he read aloud . " tnegA  --  moolbnooM namroN . " But there was this pressure on his heels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a hoop of pain . " Okay already . . . plumber , plumber . . . " He held his fingerpoised over the buttons of the memo pad . Bodien ! He pressed the B , and the device popped open to a page of names . Delightful . He looked at the swim of calligraphy , blinked , and read names . **31;4093;TOOLONG Pipe &; FoundryXotichitlBeerbau .. . " Xotichitl ? " What in the . . . Oh , but stop this , Seventieth Street was without water . He put his finger on each name , intent , not fooling now . His ears rang . He told the plumber to meet him at the Seventieth Street house and made ready to leave the office . He took the check for the insurance company and put it in an envelope , made a note to himself to look at the name on the elevator so he could call the repairman , wrote down the name and number of the electrical contractor , the exterminator , the roofing company . He tried to think who would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basellecci . " He went out patting his pockets . A delegation of women was waiting in the lobby , aproned , together in accusation but not speaking to each other . Eva Baily was more than ever like a fierce squaw ; Carol Hauser merely looked peevish under the burden of her bleached hairdo and the tugging of the blond child ; Sarah Lublin stood with melancholy serenity . Betty Jacoby was there , too , but in the artless light of the lobby , she seemed to be fading away . " Well ? " Carol Hauser said menacingly . " It 's two hours now . I was right in the middle of ... " Eva suddenly preferred to leave it at that . " The plumber is on his way . Do n't worry about a thing . We 'll take care of it , " Norman assured them . They were no more than pasteboard figures , and he smiled at how harmlessthey seemed . They went away as though a gust of wind had taken them . Bodien , the plumber , came ten minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manorial motif of the lobby was real . They tried to go down the narrow steps abreast and then spent almost two minutes , jammed between the rail and the wall , arguing politely about who should go first . Norman , not himself , said brusquely , " Okay , " and pushed out of the impasse . In the cellar he trained Bodien 's flashlight on the dust-furred pipes while the plumber tapped and felt them uncertainly . Norman waited patiently ; for what he was permitted to pay he did n't expect great professionalism . Bodien was a sort of amateur , a handy man , an unfrocked plumber whose only qualification for the trade was a **33;4126;TOOLONG . He took a Stillson wrench out of his toolbox and began to unscrew a particularly large and menacing-looking pipe.  | " Do n't you have to turn something off or something ? " Normanasked , noticing an ooze of water around the threads . " Oops , heh , heh , that 's right , " Bodien said with a wink . His face was mangy , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at constructive criticism . He turned off the main and went back to his wrench . A little squirt of water struck Norman 's face and startled him disproportionately . " Whaa-a ... " " Better step back there , " Bodien said sternly . He finished detaching the pipe and stood looking at the slow trickle with the gravity of a doctor examining a biopsy . " Mmm-mm , yeah . . " What 's wrong ? " Norman asked , feeling chilled in the stony dampness . His hand brushed against the thick dust of something , and he shuddered . " Do n't seem to be anything . . . " Norman felt like whispering ; he was reminded of clandestinegames . " Bodien . " " Yeah ? " the plumber asked . " There has to be something . The people upstairs have no water . This is not hypothetical . Something is clogging . " Well , " Bodien agreed , " there should be something . " He looked warily at the maze of pipes , then made a decision again . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " " You 're the doctor , " Norman said , following the wrench with the flashlight . His head began to hurt , and the light became heavy in his hand . Something is happening to me , he thought . He had never felt quite like this . All his life he had been subject to colds and the minor illnesses , and he remembered the dark colors of his daydreams in his grandparents ' housep75on those winter afternoons when he had been sick in bed and had seemed to fill the room with the anticipation of another dimension . He could not remember what the illusionshad been . In a way they had been purely sensory ; his whole body had awaited some unimaginable experience . There had been a delicate salting of pain on his skin , a hollow , breath-taking spasm that involved him from heart to groin . Familiar sounds had broken through to brief and unbearable clarities . But always there had been the security of knowing he would sink back , that he would recover and go on as before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of permanenteviction . What , what is this ? Bodien leaned on the shaft of his wrench . Slowly it turned metal against metal . There was a fertile smell of refuse and water and the odd silence in the pipes . Bodien grunted . The pressure on Norman 's head grew . He looked around at the darkness with a frightened longing . No , no , he would just go right home , undress , pull the shades down , and get into bed with a heating pad . The thought of pain terrified him for the first time . Could a doctor help ? He thought not , felt right then that the doctor would somehow be working against him . Bodien 's grunt was final . The pipe came apart with only a feeble trickle. " ' et 's see now . " The plumber put his hand cautiously into the pipe . His face showed a squeamish expression that graduallyevolved into complete revulsion . " Echh , " he said , drawingsomething toward him . His hand came out black and slimy and swollen four times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , but you could n't see where hand left off and catch began . The pipe belched and gushed about a gallon of water onto Bodien . He gasped , cursed , then held the slop up triumphantly. " ' ere we are , Moonbloom , ' ere 's the culprit . "  | " What is it ? " Norman asked weakly . Bodien shook his head ; that was not his concern . " Gook , " he said . Norman held the light while the pipe was put back togetherand then tracked Bodien over to the main and illuminatedthe operation of turning the water back on . There were thuds and crashes and then the terrifying rush and flow . Norman could feel an impulse to fall and be carried along by it . He ran the light over the pipes and found it shocking to hear all that violence of movement while everything in sight remained motionless . " Yessir , " Bodien said smugly , putting his wrench in his toolbox . " They got water now . " Norman looked up with him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see the metal veins carrying the flow through the body of the house , and pictured the sudden resumption of things in all the apartments . He went directly home and closed the door of his own apartment like a man pursued . The wind had left gashes on his tender face , and his eardrums felt pierced . With trembling hands he got undressed and burrowed into his bed . Brain fever , he told himself , trying to joke his way out of it . The daytime noises of the street were huge and hideous , and his limbs felt wrenched . He wondered whether he dared get up to take something , thought better of it , and lay where he was , conjuring up the figure of his crazy father and trying some unclear folk dance with him to the tune of imagined string instruments . But the city would not release him to daydream , and he dove desperately toward his usual dreamlesssleep . But it was occupied , filled like a vast hall with all the tenants . Katz tootled his trumpet in greeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . Basellecci aimed a wide/mouthed cannon at him and smiled with his canonical face . Two people were screaming . He was screaming , and he woke up filled with embarrassment and fear and lying in a drenchingsweat . He tried to question but failed halfway , and all that came from his gaping mouth in the truant hour of afternoon was a long " Whaaa-aaahh . . . "  |p78Foil  FIVE LONG days he resided in the vessel of his bed , tied to the shore by the most tenuous mooring of consciousness . Feebly he trod the precarious gangplank to the bathroomand the kitchen and then back to the somnolent , rocking bed . He did n't remember calling a doctor , but one came and gave him two kinds of capsules . Once Gaylord called about something , and he apparently made clear his situation , because the superintendent left him alone after that . He had some recollection of a silly conversation with his brother , Irwin , out of which he retained only a series of disgusted rannanas . The rest of the time was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have called his life up to that time , but it was disturbingly more appropriate to dream than life should be . He went back in time and found that his direction was more lateral than recessive . In his bed he was bruised by what turned out to be only a series of flat pictures , and he had the desperate feeling that he observed them from a position on the edge of a cold immensity and that the completion of his hallucinatory reminiscence would push him off into God knew what . And if there was pattern to how he observed that comic-strip chronicle , it was lost on him . He read in the manner of all the languages ; left to right , top to bottom , right to left . Succeeding frames had him a reedy adolescent , a toddler , a blanket-sucker of seven . Hisp79eyes fixed on the ceiling or on the rumpled cloth of bedclothing , as though any surface could reflect the pale projection . " Norman Moonbloom , " he said from time to time , animating the machinery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . There were the sounds of the days rising to climax and settling back to half-sleep . Dimly came the footsteps of his neighbors going up and down the stairs and the voice of the endless belt of traffic . " Norman Moonbloom , " he said in incantation , and he studied hard the pictures of himself , wondering what had taken so long to leave him at this point of virginal terror . Four years old on a rainy , preschool morning , sitting at the piano , playing delicate discord and pretending to be reading music with an opened dictionary on the stand . Under him , inside the bench , were all the mysterious songs locked into sheets of notes . Rain so sweet on the windows , and his grandmotherhumming " Melancholy Baby " from the kitchen . Twelve and drawing an imaginary map of an imaginary continent , armied with split peas . On the edge of his game a scornful face  --  Irwin ? He was seen as vaguely obscene , with the black down on his cheeks , still maneuvering those miniature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , snug in the sound of a man talking about such vivid horrors in Europe . A fairy-tale ease opens his mouth , his grandmother clucks behind him , he sees crayon colors , the blood red a little too waxy to believe . Fourteen , standing in a summer evening and looking deliriouslyat a girl while a dangerous boy insults him , reduces him to a bed-wetter . He smiles , offering no target , the girl laughs , tree leaves move hauntingly , a summer night as huge as heaven , smells of warm pavement . He touches his hurt but feels no pain . The other boy and the girl move off laughing , and he is a straw figure with a painted smile.  |p80Something  eludes him and he goes home and to bed while everyone else is still outside . He is three and strawberry ice cream is New Year 's Eve . His grandmother drops tears on him and holds him close . He licks the sweet pink cold . She wraps him in something light and soft and very strong . In the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he writes on the form , though he feels the same as he did at eight . He picks up his suitcase and goes out onto the campus , directions clasped in his other hand . He is in a room with a desk . This is college , but when he opens the book it is as always ; he expects momentarily to hear his grandmother humming . His age not clear , he sits on the dusty ground , the king of the ants . He builds walls and prisons and murmurs edicts . Far over the fences he hears Irwin in a ball game . The afternoonis milky with heat , and he abides . They are at the funeral chapel , with its electric-candle flames and maroon carpeting . His grandmother lies , beaky nose above the rim of the coffin , while the rabbi says some things about her that do n't seem familiar . He feels nothing painful , only a sort of nervous sadness , as though a disaster he can not remember has happened . He looks at his brother , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , threatening to fall off . He takes a deep breath of the sweetenedair and cries a little too . He and a girl named Monica Alpert are sitting beneath the oldest tree in the Western Hemisphere , or the fattest . Mexicansare moving in the sunlight beyond the immense shadow of the tree , and Monica is talking to him , offering , it seems , some great loveliness to him . She looks like a younger Edith Sitwell , and he is aware of the fine romantic quality of the setting . But all he can do is observe the motions of her lipsp81and think about the flow of the blood through his own body . He realizes that she is slipping away from him , running down like water in a drain . There is only a small puddle left , and he feels he should reach out for her in some way but does n't . Soon he is walking through the foreign town with a book under his arm . He is alone and searching for a regret he can not feel . The town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of teeth and jaws , skeletons of feet , engravings of Old Testament passions , the flayed Vesalius figure , " . . . and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes . " Outside this dormitory window or that one ( leaded panes or honest wood ) snow is Christmascardpretty , and there are very few tracks , because most students are away for the holidays . He supposes melancholy but achieves only that numb cosiness . Moonbloom on campus concentrates on psych . And , most profoundly , he is being soaked in the words of his grandmother , marinated in the membranous belief she lives by . They sit , just the two of them , on the thousand and one Connecticut nights , listening to the radio and talking during the commercials while winter wind or summer mistraltumbles husband , wild son , arrogant older grandson . And he is all she has , so she preserves him in a shell of moderation , warns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawl beneath it and dwell in warmth and safety ... . He opened his eyes on the fifth afternoon to see his window shade aflame with sunshine . His beard scratched on the pillow , and his sheets were gray with sweat . Weak as a newborn , he nevertheless realized that he had no way of avoiding whatever it was that had happened to him . Timidly he got up , and found that something had been torn away from him , that all the details of the room made deep impressions onp82his eyes . There was a blistering of plaster at the junction of wall and ceiling , the doorframe had a painted-over cut , the window shade was like worn skin , and he shuddered for it . He went into the bathroom and adjusted the water in the shower , solicitous of his frail , skinny body . The water drummed on him , wakening all his nerves . He dressed carefully in clean clothes and then wondered whether he would dare the outside . It was Thursday ; tomorrowhe would have to start collecting the rents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the houses ? How high were the bills piled in his basement office ? Dread of the familiar routine filled him . The illness had done something to him . For some reason , he had no idea what to expect from himself . Even walking was new to him , and he found himself estimating his weight distribution with each step . Shaved , swaddled as warmly as possible in suit and overcoat , he put his hand on the doorknob . God help him , he was not prepared for this . And he went out into a strange city.  |p83ON  THURSDAY MORNING , during the time Norman was crawlingout of the last of his hallucinatory illness , Lester exploded at the final soft probing of his aunt Minna . " You want to know what 's bothering me ? " he screeched , shaving soap still on his earlobe and Eva extending a tentativehand to wipe it off as well as to gentle the high-strung ( how the two aunts loved that word on him ) boy . " Well I 'll tell you , I 'll tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your little nephew Lester has gotten into man-sized trouble . " " What , what ? " Eva moaned . She and Minna were together in the pummeling of fear while their nephew 's fresh-squeezed orange juice settled in the glass and his Cream of Wheat turned cool . The oil of the vitamin drops would show on the top of the juice , Eva worried , like evidence of evil intent on her part . " Do n't get all worked up , Lester dear . Just tell me . " Let 's just sit down and talk it out , " Minna said with her usual attempt at psychological resolution . " There 's nothing that ca n't be talked out . " But she knew she would be going to the office with a stone in her stomach , and she hated to throw up in that tiny lavatory where everyone could hear her . " There 's no sense in just ... " " It 's a girl ! " Lester said grimly , studying the orange juice . " Drink it , " Eva said.  |p84Lester  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Minna seemed to gargle the word . " What do you mean ? " " What do I mean ? I mean that I 've gotten her in trouble . " He chopped at the cereal , his weak , youthful face raked by misery and anger and fear . " She 's pregnant , she 's pregnant . " " Oh God , " Eva said , clapping her hand to her heart . Minna bolted for the bathroom , and Eva and Lester were motionless in the sound of her vomiting , guilty , anguished , and resigned . Finally Minna came back , chalk colored , her lipstick and rouge like embalmer cosmetics on her face . " All right , " she said in a dead , purged voice . " Tell us about it . " And Lester proceeded to narrate the tedious details they had enjoyed smugly in books and on television programs for years . A girl who worked in the same office , someone he had been dating for some time . They had gotten to that point where . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decent girl in spite of . . . She had missed two  --  you knows .. . her family would be wild . . . . No , it did n't show . Yes he was sure he was the one  --  she had n't seen anyone else since . No , of course he did n't want to get married , he was too young and had n't found himself ... . Strangely , the more he talked and the more his helpless misery was revealed , the more animated the two aunts ' faces became . Minna seemed to get some color back , Eva became sly and strong looking and more Indian than ever . Occasionally she touched her sister to mark a certain detail , and Minna nodded knowingly back at her . What was common to both of them revealed a side of their old , deformed love for each other . If Lester noticed a perversity in their rekindled faces , he did n't know what he felt about it  --  gratitude for their protection or resentment for their finding strength in his fiasco . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden on them . They were at least mothers , perhaps more ; to date they had not let anything irrevocable happen to him . Once he had stolen a piddling amount and they had taken care of it ; another time he had cheated on a school examination and they had smoothed that over . He had come home sick and drunk and frustrated , feelinglike an exile from the world , and they had warmed him and reminded him that he was important there . He was stuck together with the adhesive liquid of their love , and in their presence he could never come undone . After a while he was smoking peacefully and sharing their solemn study of the problem . " Drink your juice , " Eva said in a tone of renewed command . And Lester , temporarily knowing his place again , drank the juice and imagined a bleak peace for a while . " There are several things to do , " Minna said , smoking so quickly the cigarette was down to a stub in no time . " There are doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lester sat open-mouthed before their old powers . Minna nodded sternly , her face filled with unaccustomed strength . " And there are medicines . . . " " And if those do n't work ? " Lester whined , on the verge of nervous laughter because of the deep relief he felt . " Well there are homes where a girl can have her child without anyone knowing . They put the child out for adoption . It probably wo n't come to that , but just in case , I will look into it . We can speak to her family and no outsiders need know . " " See , you get out in the business world and you know so many things , " Eva said in grudging tribute to her sister . " Oh my God , everyone knows about those things , " Minna said , taking the tribute loftily . Lester finished his breakfast , taking deep breaths and lettingp86them out in sighs after each mouthful . When he was finished he kissed each of his aunts and told them he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just nodded sadly , full of their beloved cross , doting on the sweet sorrow he brought them . They sent him off to work and then looked at each other over coffee . " Did you expect anything like that ? " Eva said dolefully . " Lester is . . . is susceptible . He 's high-strung , emotional . It was something I had considered . " " Well I never . . . I mean , it 's terrible , " Eva said into her cup . " Yess-s , " Minna said dubiously . " When you have a boy ... " " They 're hard to bring up . But he has good things . It 's just a question of finding himself . " " That 's all it is . " Minna stubbed out her cigarette , drank the last of her coffee , and stood up . " I 'm going to have to make some phone calls , speak to some of the girls in the office . . . you know . " Eva nodded . " Do n't forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minna held up the bag to show she had it . " Do n't worry , " she said . " No , no , I wo n't worry . " For a long time after her sister had gone she sat at the kitchen table examining a little corner of ironic life . She had been married for three years , and she and Joe had tried to make a baby all the time . All she had left from that brief wedlock was an official married name and a weapon to use cruelly in her fights with Minna . Lester had let himself go just once perhaps , and look at the trouble . And where had Minna learned that ugly wisdom ? Had she perhaps herself been . . . No , not Minna ; she was too fastidious to have been kissed by a man . Was n't it all strange ? And yet wasn'tp87it a consolation to know Lester still needed them ? With a sigh that was a good deal sadder than she felt , she got up and did the dishes . When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met Betty Jacoby , and they stood for a while in that brief neighborly attitude of exchanging talk . " A young boy like my nephew has problems . It 's hard for us old ones to remember what things look like . He gets involved  --  it'sthe enthusiasm of the young . " Betty could n't stand up straight for the tug of arthritis and yet she almost relaxed because she did n't have to pretend it was n't there . Only in Arnold 's presence did she keep herself erect and let the dim light efface all the time in her face and body . " They 're the same at seventy , " she said , " just older boys . Arnold is trying to keep some kind of trouble about his job from me , but I know . They 're so transparent , so foolish . You ca n't be honest with males , you dare n't . " " I know , " Eva said . " They 'd be lost without us . " And two blocks away , at the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schoenbrun . " Just getting a little air before I go to work , " Arnold said cheerily . " Well it 's at least a place for a little peace and quiet , " the handsome young man said , sitting on the end of the bench . " This city is so crowded with crude people , noisy abusive people . " " It 's a little slow down to the plant , you see . Actually , I 'm kind of on a holiday because it 's so slow , " Arnold said . " See , they finish with their Christmas stuff in September and . . . I do n't like to let on to my wife because she 'd right away think , Uh uh , he 's getting the sack because of his age . It 's not true , of course , but it does n't pay to get the women all in a dither . " " And those two crazy musicians , " Marvin said . " They havep88no respect for other people . Last night I had a splitting headache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all hours . In a crowded city you have to have some respect for others . I sit and try to listen to something nice on my hi-fi , and they start blasting that trash so your ears could burst . " Arnold nodded politely . " At least the weather is still fine . Hate to be spending my days in the park in drizzle or snow . " " One can contemplate a little here , " Marvin said . " One is n't abused and annoyed . " " Almost like the country , " Arnold said . They sat without talking for a while . The trees were a dark tracery against the clear morning sky , and above the modest traffic on Central Park West , the birds that stayed for winter could be heard in wing flutters nearby or an occasional piping from a thicket . The ground had that heartbreaking color of lost green and brown , and some taller winter grass was pink where the cinder path turned out of sight . Now and then the wind swung the tops of the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the park , of the beasts that were now interned in the heated buildings . Arnold 's face was rosy and was sunk into his upturned collar , which was somewhat threadbare where it met his ears ; his eyes were half closed . Marvin sat erect in his velvet-collared coat , an exquisite profile against the subtle colors of the winter-bound landscape . " I tried to speak to them reasonably , " Marvin said , his eyes fixed on something too small to see . " I merely asked them to respect their neighbors . That Sidone is just a maniac , but it was Katz who was deliberately cruel . The unnecessary things , the vulgar things he said . I do n't know why people have to go out of their way to humiliate ... "  | " It 's sure funny , " Arnold said , really commenting upon his own odd form of love . " Hardly funny , " Marvin said . " Kind of terrible , I 'd say . " " Well yes , terrible too I suppose , but . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it any different if I had it to do all over . " " I do n't know , " Marvin said . He looked at his watch and stood up . " Goodness , I must run along . So long , Mr. Jacoby , " he said , crunching away on the path . " Call me Arnold , " Arnold answered absently , taking his hand out of his pocket to wave . Then he sank down deeper into his coat and studied a finch he had n't seen the like of since boyhood . The wind tapped at the soft brim of his hat , and he thought of his Betty moving in beauty in the dim warmth of the apartment . The day seemed long ahead of him , and he refused to think about what he would do when the weather got too cold for him to sit there or what he would do when the money ran out . The sun rained twig shadows on the little huddled pile of him . " That fusty little bitch Marvin Schoenbrun , Katz said in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Sidone , are you noisy and coarse ? " Sidone , costumed for the outdoors , on his way to the union office in Alpine hat and ever-present sunglasses , his skinny body human in a black Loden coat , spread his fingers in shock . " Coarse ? Noisy ? Why , what a perfectly bitchy thing to say , lover . I am the very soul of refinement . We both are . There is n't a rough edge to us . We shit vaseline . I mean we 're so smooth . What a freshy that Marvin is ! " Katz laughed like an engine without oil . " Did I tell him off or did I ? "  | " Oh , you were so cru-el , sweetness . You accused him of being a homo-sex-ual ! Now he wo n't come down to see us any more . " He brayed happily . Sidone left him with only the reverberations of his laughter for company , and Katz zigzagged from littered table to stained chair to defaced wall , miming his own tiny-arced smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of his panic made it difficult to adjust to the precision of dressing himself . Four times he tried to tie his tie , his wide cheery face a blur in the bad mirror . He ended up pulling the tie through his collar and off as though it were a piece of gut that held his insides together . " That gay little jerk , " he said aloud . " He had it coming to him . What does he expect ? What am I supposed to do for him ? Have n't I got enough ? " He had been indoctrinated with his own unworthiness by his father , a man who had loved his son but who had lived in fear of love and its vulnerability . Katz tried a bow tie , shaking in an effort to clear his throat of the phlegm of self-hatred . In the mirror , which was worn half out of its reflective backing , he saw , behind his curly head , the face of the cancer-killed Katz Senior , speaking silently from his sour mouth , saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out in what seemed a safer language , so all the young trumpeter could hear was " You 're stupid , Stanley , you 're stupid and hopeless and you 'll never get anywhere . Blow your horn , drink and whore with those nuts , those musicians . I 'll bail you out of an alcoholic ward , I 'll pay for mercury treatments for the syph . I 'm your father and I 'm used to what you are . " And then it was that sour face extending on the horizontal from one side of the mirror frame , sunken into a pillow , and its wide structure ( Stanley was in its image ) stripped of the insulating flesh . And it was the last chance for both of them to redeem thatp91tormenting bond . The sucked-in lips tried to shape those words that had always been such a horror to him , to speak ultimately what was the truth before blackness obscured even the worst of sins . And he said it , he did say , " I love you so much , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mutilation , I love love love you . " But all that the mortal ears of Katz could hear was the whispered , " You bum , Stanley , you poor stupid bumm-mm . . . " Ah , crap ! " Katz cried , throwing the tie down and taking a little clip-on maroon bow tie that he wore with his musician 's tuxedo . " Screw that little faggot Schoenbrun ! " He went into the other room and got his trumpet . A handkerchief brought it to a zenith of brightness , and he raised it to his lips . Wah wahtvah wah . The air broken through , he took a brief , swift ride , roller-coastering over the scales and then landing on a cushioning pool of melody . His fingers punted the vessel of sound gracefully along the shore of silence , in and out of tiny coves . And he was looking up and ahead for some tremendous cataract that would give him the golden rush of triumph big enough to translate a dead man 's language , to convert it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he dreamed alertly , one hand cupping the bell of the instrument in a pulsating muting . Wah wahwah wah wahwah wahh .. . Doors slammed in the hallway as the other tenants went out to work . He had as long as he needed , a night worker trespassing on the day . He blew through his trumpeter 's flattened lips , effacing Schoenbrun , blowing away the dead king of a hardware man who might have been pleading for some kind of vindication too ; he eliminated the specter of his own frame of failure . Katz then , in the morning of the city , was adorning himself with his only covering , playingp92foolish , cheap little songs with all his heart and all his talent , and for a little while it was more than enough , much more than enough . But a man 's breathing is a tricky thing , and the flow of saliva , like that of blood , can undo you . He coughed and cut his soul on an evil note . " Friggen faggot coming down here . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white , murderous look on his face . The clicks of the locks were like the sounds of nails in a coffin . He put on his belted flannel coat , his sunglasses and Hawkshaw hat . There was no staying there , and by concentrating on the union hall , he kept thoughts broken into small digestible words . Jim Sprague came into the hallway at the same moment , his coat buttoned wrong and lipstick cockeyed on a corner of his mouth . " Hello there , Sidone , " he said with a bluff , manly smile . " Whatta ya say , " Katz answered , not bothering to correct him ; fifty per cent of the time he came out Katz  --  it was more than enough . " Going to the subway ? " Jim Sprague asked . Katz could n't deny it . They rode down in the groaning elevatorwith nothing to look at but the " Did Not Pass Inspection " notice and the rusted drawings of genitalia . " Our noise bother you ? " Katz asked grimly . " What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his expression one of distaste for himself ; he thought his body had somehow gotten out of line . " Our practicing , you know  --  the trumpet , Sidone 's drums . " He had no real hope of vindication from this fogbound man . " Oh , he 's the trumpeter , " Sprague said , throwing his head back in a silent guffaw at his mistake . " I thought Katz was the drummer . "  | " I 'm Katz , Sidone is . . . " He waved the whole thing away , his eyes half closed in exasperation . . . no , not exasperation ; he would have been happy with just that . An unhealthy sheen of sweat skinned him to the cold breeze , his skittery smile was curved around fury and anguish . " That damned Schoenbrun , you know , the fairy with the pretty face  --  he came up this morning and complained about our vulgar music . " Jim Sprague looked at Katz 's face , intent on sound and look to the exclusion of confusing words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and without definition he stored something he felt , something he would attempt to tell Jane about later but which would come out only as he had received it  --  as feeling . And she would become as hopelesslyentangled in that as she was in everything else , though it would also wed them again . Indeed , when Jane Sprague hung up after talking to him , she felt apprehensive and sad . She got up and wondered why she could n't see her feet any more . Oh , she knew she was pregnant and had Jim 's baby growing like a polliwog inside , and of course she knew that their making love had brought it about . But there was a huge WHY lowered like a veil over her brain . Like everyone else , she and Jim had had sad childhoods but not terrible ones . They had sneaked out of infancy and adolescence with only their intellects impaired , and they consoled each other over and over for that with mindless tenderness . The thing was , they had never owned anything of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious possessions . Now , as a result of their habitual consolations  --  an act that always left Jane a little frightened , as though such delight could n't belong to her  --  she was swollen with something too good to be true or recognizable.  |p94She  walked through the apartment humming the tone of her husband 's voice on the telephone . He had asked again what he was supposed to buy for her on his lunch hour , had spoken vaguely about the mishaps he had encountered with an upper plate he was working on in the dental laboratory , had asked how she felt . And yet , as always , he had transmittedsome feeling he could not articulate , and she was left with this new brand of uneasiness . Finally she went downstairs to get the mail , just to ease herself . At the mailboxes , she met Sarah Lublin and felt comforted . " Your face is changing , " Sarah said with a smile . " That means a boy . " Jane smiled and touched her face , somehow able to accept that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , you have children , " she said . " How does it feel ? No , I mean to be a mother . . . a mother ? " She had to tilt her head a little at that fantastic word ; she , Jane Colwell of the harassed and puzzling girlhood . All she saw of herself was a short girl with a stained brown dress , smiling politely on the fringes of other people 's laughter . " I mean , " she went on , taking the letters from the brass mailbox and looking at her name framed behind cellophane on the envelopes , " you have the boy and the girl . " " Oh , with children you worry and are always running to them . They never let things be , they bother their father . And yet , they keep him , my husband , they keep him . . . interested . He could be a cold stone , I think , but he listens for what they are doing , he touches them . I think he would be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear what they are into . He has had very bad times and he would perhaps never think about anything else except for them . Yes , with children you get out of yourself and you allowp95yourself to accept the future . Of course they tire you , and you never run out of things to worry about , but still . . . " She stared apprehensively at the envelope she had just taken from her mailbox , her expression indicating that she was reading a language she had n't seen for some time . " Oh my , " she said in a quietly appalled voice . " It is from my husband 's uncle . I just know what he says . " Sarah looked up at Jane , ascertained that this vague and absent girl would not be able to repeat what she was told in the relieving mood of confidence , and went on to shake out the sudden dust of anxiety that the scrawled writing on the envelope had dropped on her . " This uncle of Aaron 's , he was in The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been living in Baltimore with some friends . Aaron sends him money . Always he asks to come and live here with us , but of course my husband would not have it . He grows angry each time , and each time the uncle 's letter becomes more strong , more needy . I know this man . He is cunning , he has learned to take from others . I never dare take either side in my husband 's arguments with himself . It is apparent that either way , to take him or not to take him , is painful for Aaron . Still , somehow I know it would be difficult , most difficult , if he comes . " She shook the letter with a little flapping sound . " I do n't look forward , " she said . " This letter . " " I do n't know , " Jane said , looking at her hands clasped on her belly . " Things are so funny , children , letters . I wonder if they really mean me when they write my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Does that really . . . What are your children 's names again ? I forget . " " And the apartment is small , " Sarah said , with the envelope against her lips , splitting her breath . " It would be peculiar for the children . He 's an old man , perhaps not so clean . Thep96apartment ... Oh , and I wish that they would take care of that sink , with its dripping , and the elevator . I speak to the agent and he listens politely , but you know how these people are . Aie , I tell you . . . " And Jim , " Jane said , leaving it at that , so the two of them stood in the morning sunlight of the entry , the gold color of the bank of mailboxes gilding their faces ; they were like floaters in the lake of words to which they could n't find beginning or end . Until , imbued with something of each other , they went back to their own apartments , sadly dreamy and adrift . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just emerged from the candy store where he had bought cigarettes and now stood for a few minutes , bemused by the covers of the girly magazines . Had it been possible for them to avoid each other , they would have done so , not because there was hostility between them , but because there was n't , because there was nothing . To Sherman , the short Polish Jew was as much background as the colored shipping clerks in the grocery jobbing firm where he worked , human , he supposed , but hardly on the same route of the maze as he was . And to Aaron , the nattily dressed man with the presumptuousHomburg was only part of the cold and alien stone of the city to which he was exiled . " Morning , " Sherman said , bending his lips slightly . " Rather cold , " Aaron said . He fell more or less into step with the longer-legged man . " Winter practically , gon na have worse . " " Of course the children do not mind it . They like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so near . " They entered what was becoming a stream of people headed for the subway.  | " Oh yeah , my Bobby , " Sherman said , his bony face becomingpulverized by that tenderness which had no transitory state and so came out like a sudden rawness . The dim , morningeroticism faded from his mind ; the black howl of his recent exchange with Carol became , in retrospect , no more than a normal marital spat ; besides , there was the ease of true common ground here . " He loves to play with your boy and girl . My wife tells me they play nice together . " " My girl is maternally inclined ; she likes to be the little mother . Her own brother does not accept this gracefully , but your son apparently does . " " Ah , he 's a son of a gun , that Bobby , " Sherman wailed in a tone of grotesque frailty . Aaron just glanced sideward with masked repugnance . " Yess-s , " he said , gradually allowing the thickening stream of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descended the subway steps they were out of sight of each other . Basellecci went into the accounting office and dropped his envelope on the girl 's desk . " For Mr. Kaplowe , " he said . " My own personal tax information is there , as well as some things from the school . He will know . " Around him , typewritersand adding machines made an exaggerated parody of summer-insect sounds . " Fine , Mr. Basellecci , " the girl said . Basellecci responded with a strained , rather gray smile and turned back toward the door . He passed a cubicle where a man sat playing a silent tune on a small calculator , his sleeves rolled up to reveal blue , tattooed numbers on one forearm . Aaron looked up and met Basellecci 's eyes , mistakenly thought he recognized their common past , and then disdained even the doubt by going back to work without facial reaction of any kind . Basellecci felt the clench of pain in his lowerp98abdomen and attributed it to the rocklike face of the accountant . His pained smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few minutes later he was in the doctor 's office explaining both his symptoms and his own diagnosis . " I am very certain , " he said to the patiently amused doctor , " that it is all a result of my emotions because of the environment of my toilet chamber . My lower parts , " he said delicately , " clench like a fist with anger and anxiety . When , after many days and some laxatives , I do achieve a painful movement , it is hardly relief ; the pain persists . " The doctor gave him a brief examination , which included the indignity of a rectal exploration . Bent over in that humiliating position , Basellecci vented his hatred on the accursed wall , on his whole apartment and building , and finally on Norman Moonbloom . In that posture , he felt squeezed of all his youthful dreams of dignity and joy , and , like many people separated from the place of their youth , blamed even the land and the city that had betrayed him to age and failure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cruel finger touched some deep tender place . " Such a thing to happen to a man ! " As he drew up his pants and his dignity with a white , bitter face , the doctor , a young Italian with a tiredly compassionateexpression that was reduced by chronic amusement , sat back in his swivel chair , the tips of his fingers together as though to complete a circuit of thought . " I would like to have you take some tests , Mr. Basellecci . There are indications of some kind of obstruction . " " After the holidays perhaps , " Basellecci said , waving an exasperated hand . " In the meantime , could you perhaps give me some medication for present relief ? " " Yes , I 'll give you a couple of prescriptions , one of whichp99is a tranquilizer , " the doctor said , writing on his pad . He looked up with an absently frightening expression . " But I do n't want you to neglect this . I want you to have those tests . " " Yes , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , after all , was only of some future humiliation . And in the afternoon , going back up the stairs of the reeking , dark hallway of his home , he was startled by the hooded , inhuman-looking eyes of the young Chinese as they passed on the first landing . Wung took the hostile glance as his due , without anger , without the recourse of defiance . Going outside , he was too relieved to be deserting the scene of his insane dreams . Something was draining from him during his orgiastic nights ; he had a dim recollection of bland , powerfully loving Chinese faces , and he was murdering them constantly . As he walked down Mott Street , he wondered for the millionth time how he had gotten behind his face , did not dare think that he had been born there and that he was severing himself from what he was ; the tie was already frayed by abuse , and when it parted  --  void ! At the bus stop he kept his eyes and his consciousness on the full figure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she met his eyes and gave him the delightful pain he took for pleasure . Kram came down the same steps a few minutes later and slipped on some small piece of garbage . Falling , he imagined helpless crippling and cried out in a rare spasm of fear , and then landed surprisingly on his feet . He walked outside shakily , his forehead damp ; he felt an immense self-disgust , as though he were a half-crushed insect . Some half a mile uptown , Lehi Cass paid her bill and went out of the luncheonette to the bus stop , trying to exorciseP100her feeling of shame and unworthiness . She had just been to a studio for a reading and had seen by the casting director'sexpression that she had failed . And yet she had n't been able to resist smiling sexily at him and flaunting her body as she walked . In that abyss of humility , she had known that he could have gotten her to sleep with him by a single word , so desperate had she been to mark him in some way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick , dreading the sight of her son , Richard . She sat erect , a rather severe expression on her face , reclaiming at least an outward semblanceof dignity . She had images of herself splayed out nakedly under the bodies of the many men she had made love with . A vileness filled her so she could hardly breathe . Furtively she began crying in the warm quiet of the almost empty bus . And in the hallway of the apartment house , she was pushed back under even that surface of dignity when she found herselfsmiling seductively at Wade Johnson , who terrified her with a slight bow , his rage suddenly localized in his groin . " Good day , Miss Cass , ma'am , " he said . There was vibrant threat in his voice . And unable to return to a milder mood in time , Wade Johnson greeted Milly Leopold in a like manner before going into his apartment . And Milly Leopold carried that intimidating excitement into her own rooms , where J. T. glimpsed its flush , saw it as a goad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fury , so that the blueness of his face spread out through the air and stifled Milly with grief . On the floor below , Ilse Moeller slammed her window shut against the sound , remembering a similar cough coming from a slatted freight car in a Dresden station . She hurriedP101out of her apartment , later than usual because she had to go on an errand up to Connecticut , to her employer 's house . She rode in an almost empty local , picked up the papers at her boss 's home in Stamford , and then rode back to the city on a train from Boston . A man came through selling candy , his sales spiel interspersed with jokes and preposterous philosophic sallies . Ilse sat brooding at the rusty landscape rushing by the grimy train windows ; the smoke of a Port Chester factory chimney chilled her with reminiscence , and she huddled into herself , nagged by the silly dialogue of the Jewish-looking candy butcher . " Hersheys , Nestles , peanut brittle , awrange drink , tequila , and dream-inducing mushrooms , " Sugarman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mounds , aphrodisiacs , and sundry items . " Last night , for the first time in his life , he had been unable to perform sexually with his lady of the evening , and he was near the bottom of his well of inexplicable mourning . Not that the woman had mattered , not that Sugarmanhad ever planned on perpetuating himself or had ever been concerned with manifestations of his manhood , because he saw himself as a neuterized figure , an implement of this , his humble ritual . " Let the good sweet juices of melted chocolate sweeten the tentacles of your soul . This is fresh chocolate made with the milk of rare Arabian mares taken at the full of the moon . There is chocolate and there is chocolate . Who 'll buy ? Awrange drink , ice cold , specially toasted peanuts . This offer is for a limited time only . " Yet somehow that small genitalfailure , perhaps only a result of weariness and lack of enthusiasm for his partner , had somehow managed to tighten a lid of futility on him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he remembered . He began to wonder about his relationship to life , to doubt that it existed at all . P102And thus hollowed , he went home . In the hallway he met Del Rio , burdened with pail and scrub brush , on his way in to clean the bathroom . " Del Rio , " he said . " Hello , Sugarman , " Del Rio answered affably . Sugarman was the only one in the house who did not offend him by filthy habits . Sugarman went sighing up the stairs , and Del Rio set to work on the bathroom tub and floor , snarling at the occasional cockroaches and silver fish that darted out of his reach with more than human cunning . And when he was done , he went out into the hallway to find Paxton waiting to get into the bathroom and Louie coming down the stairs with his little toilet-article bag . " I 'm not your goddamn maid , " he shouted at the two of them . " Why do I have to clean that place every other day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clean it . You splash water on the floor and attract the roaches ; you do n't flush the toilets half the time . " " Perhaps we are not so repelled by the functions of our own bodies , " Paxton said , walking past Del Rio with his effeminate gait . " Do n't sass me , you little black queen . I know dirt is your natural element , " Del Rio snarled furiously . Paxton stopped just inches from the powerfully built fighter , his dark , knobby face angled into a malevolent squint . " Now , Del Rio , " he said softly , the breath hissing around his words as though he had sprung a leak because of extreme pressure . " Hear me , doll . In sex I may have my circuits crossed , and there is no denying the evidence of my pigmentation . But listen to this , you punchy bastard , I know what I am , and from my heritage I have an agility with the razor that does not extend merely to shaving . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savagely breathing man long enough to establish his lack of fear , and then , with a sardonic smile , entered the bathroom and slammed the door . " And you too , dimwit , " Del Rio cried to Louie on the stairs , prevented by law and fear from making a physical attack . But even Louie got his revenge , just by teetering sickly on the steps , his eyes rolling samples of his weird , inner pain . Del Rio threw his clothes on and stormed down the stairs , blackened by his own cruelty , which was a sign to him of the disorder always threatening his spirit . As he passed Karloff 's door , he swung hard and crashed the side of his fist on the old man 's door . Inside , Karloff stood up in desperate rage , and the house vibrated around him like a settling penny , until there was stillness of a sort and he sat back down , staring with his terrible eyes at the beaten door . P104NORMAN SAT ON Eva Baily 's tapestried chair unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His nose , his ears , his eyes , all shot sensation into him at alarming speed . " Yes , I 've been sick , " he answered , fondling the plastic cover of the receipt book . " Well , there 's always something , " she said , anxious to get into her own preoccupation . " I do n't seem to have the time to get sick , not that kind of sick anyways . I worry myself sick with that boy , but I ca n't get to lie down and convalesce . " She smiled wanly in appreciation of her own succinctness , but did not pause long enough for Norman to interrupt . " The things a boy can get involved in ! Not that he 's bad , understand . High-strung is more what it is . You take a placid , dull sort and it 's not so likely he 'll get into trouble . But someonelike my Lester . . . I think of him like a son . He 's lived with us since he was four and his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father went in an auto accident the year before . It all seemed to have happened together . First my husband . You may have wondered why my name is Baily , same as my sister Minna . Well , he was a distant cousin . But anyhow , all those things happening together , it was almost like Lester being born to me . Now , of course , he 's gone and gotten ... involved with some girl . He thinks he 's a man , but as soon as there 's trouble he runs to us . Well , that 's as it should be . Plenty of time for him to get independent . Of course , th " re'sp105ugliness in certain things , people get hurt . Do n't think I do n't feel sorry for the girl , but still , that kind of a girl . . . " Norman nodded , dodging the hail of words . And yet many of them struck him . He saw the long , shallow shadow beside each of her wrinkles , the flat , sightless look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wanted to see . And the intimacy that was forced on him was an irritant to which he was no longer immune . " Just what kind of trouble is he in ? " he asked , knowing , but needing to get something back from her . " Oh . . . it really is n't any . . . that is , a young man . . . " She giggled nervously , realizing the full extent of her indiscretion . " I 'm just saying that a young fellow should n't get . . . I mean , it 's lucky he has , that we have . . . " " Has he gotten some girl pregnant ? " He was surprised at himself , at the way things whistled into and out of him . " Oh my , what a thing , of course . . . It 's really a personal problem . . . Here I am , just going on . . . You probably have things to do . The rent , you 're waiting for the rent . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making innumerable tic-tac-toe games . " Yes , the rent . " " It 's just that people sometimes feel they have to talk about things and they do n't dare talk to themselves . " She made it a plea . " Yes , well , I 'll be back next week . " You understand . " " Oh yes , sure , I understand , " he said harshly , wondering what he wanted from her . He got up , leaving the receipt . " And this is only the first call . " " I beg pardon ? " Her courtesy was sleazy , threadbare . " I have dozens of other apartments to call on , " he said . " I do n't look forward . "  | " I 'm sorry , " she said , humiliated . But he was n't able to cut her completely off . " It 's just that I 've been sick  --  my nerves are still not right . " " You should rest . Rest is the only way . " " Okay , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm sorry if I . . . " That 's all right . Next week . " He had to hurry to the next apartment as though the empty hallway were enfiladed by a rifle equipped with a silencer . Betty Jacoby let him in , went to the living-room table where her pocketbook lay , and then seemed to explode in a burst of acid-white light . She and Norman looked up , stupefied , at the window shade , still spinning , rolled up at the top of the window . She was old and crippled , and her skeletal fingers , knobbed with arthritis , quavered beside a mouth that radiated wrinkles and looked like a great , stitched scar . " Oh my , that gave me a start , " she said . She turned to Norman and put a hand up to her hair for some feminine protection . " I 'm sorry , I 'm afraid I look a fright . I have n't had a chance to do anything . Heavens , I would n't want Arnold to walk in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the shape of that . It was impossible and wrong . He went toward her with his hand out , and she backed away , smilingly frightened . " No , no , the shade , " he said . " I 'll just fix the shade for you . " " Oh , please do ! " she cried . She watched him pull a chair to the window and silently ask her permission to stand on it , which she gave with a quick , single dart of her head . When she spoke , it was with a mixture of wistfulness and terror , and he felt it behind him as he stood spread-eagled against the glass and the daylight . " It 's not that I have anything to hide from you , of course . But then , people , people who must live with one another for great lengths of time , must havep107things just so . Arnold and I have worked things down to .. . to this . People who must live intimately must be oh so delicate about what they surround @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooks and stepped down . " Do you have a fork ? " he asked . " I think that 's how to do it . " She almost backed into the kitchen . " A fork , " she announced , coming back and handing it to him . He did n't look at her face again until he had rewound the spring , replaced the roller , and drawn down the shade . " One tine is a little bent , " he said . " Do n't let them tell you about the ease of old age , " she said , the guile restored to her by the dimness . " They say that old people are n't concerned about appearances . Oh , no , that 's not true at all . We , Arnold and I , keep more things from each other than ever . It 's hard to make you see . If he walked in like you did . . . " Her breath shuddered audibly , and Norman was forced to look around for the monstrous source of horror ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some abandoned stage-set that was lent mystery only by its antiquity . " But was there something I was supposed to do ? " he asked , feeling a sensation of brutishness . " It was n't you who had the trouble with your stove ? " " No , no , I 'll tell you when there 's something for you to do , " she answered with a chuckle . She paid him , and he left ; and , in the hallway , that was all he could account for . But he felt like a man unused to exercise who has been forced into an unpleasant scuffle . He was breathing hard , and his heart made itself known in his temples . The hallway looked strange and filled him with uneasiness ; from the way his body strained against imbalance , its floor might have been tilted . For a moment he looked at the rough , dust-pocketed stucco on the walls , wonderingp108if this were dream and the prismatic reminiscences of his illness were the real life he lived . A faintly familiar smile warmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logic , a lecture about the evidence of The Now . " What is dream ? " he said to himself with exaggerated theatricality , but then lost his smile as he felt the walls press their texture on him with breath-taking clarity . Nothing had ever been so real ! He could see himself in the large , shapeless suit , the comical bootlegger 's hat , a slight bundle of a man with a clean , new , discount-store shirt and a tie so somber that it lay like an apology over his chest . He could see his frail mouth and his bruised-looking eyes planted on a thin man 's face that caught the faint reflection from the top of a ballpointpen in the breast pocket . He could see even the Red Cross button from another year , caught in the clumsy lapel  --  one of the tags he used to identify himself . For just an instant he felt a flash of horror , a sensation as visceral as that felt by a child who glimpses the great , complexgut of adults for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light his long childhood had been , and wondered how in the world he would support the weight he suspected . The hollow coughing from a distant apartment , the child 's ranting cry from another , alarmed him by their intimation of great size . A bulb flicked on in that presupper hour of November . Great flexings took place on all sides . He slapped his receipt book and rushed to the next door . Carol Hauser let him in , one hand up to her structured hair . Under her pink , quilted robe she wore black nylon stockings and red-leather shoes with needle-thin heels . " We 're going out , " she said , stilt-walking over to the table where the lamp-shade river flowed endlessly . " To Radio City and then Lindy 's . I 'm in the middle of dressing . "  |p109He  wondered what he could say to that and looked at the child for a cue . The little boy hovered near his mother , sniffing her strong scent and waving his hands . His face had the scared-thrilled expression of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we go out like this ; the rest of the time it 's just cards with friends . I like to go out , " she said , turning an unusually soft smile on Norman . " I like to see Sherman in his best suit , his shoes all shined , his face pink from shaving . And I like to feel bright and dressed up and to say good night to Bobby when the sitter comes , and see how impressed he is at my fancy duds . That 's one thing about this country , Mr. Moonbloom . When a person gets dressed up , there 's no telling which are the rich and which are the poor . I mean , my husband and I may fight a lot , like other people , but when we go out like this , to a night club or a show , we 're like on a date . All this boring routine and everything is like it never happened . Sherman is a good dancer too . He looks good in clothes too . Right Bobby ? Does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She took the child 's hand and began doing a little dance with him ; his small feet tripped all over each other trying to follow her cha-cha steps . Norman watched their feet as he waited for his money , and somehow the child 's seemed crippled and lost . " Ohh , I 'm sorry , " Carol said , stopping and reaching once more for her pocketbook . " I 'm in a silly mood . " " Why ca n't I go too ? " Bobby asked . " I 'm big . " " When you get grown up , darling , then you 'll go too . And Daddy and Mommy will be grandparents . " She turned to Norman with the money . " My husband is graying at the temples . It 's very becoming . I 'm thinking of having my hair frosted . " She turned back to Bobby . " And Mommy and Daddy will stay home with your children , and you 'll go out to swell places . "  | " But now , " Norman said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you give him ? " " What do you mean ? " " I do n't know , " Norman said , looking at the fake fire in the fireplace . " I just look around here and I wonder what he thinks is real , what he believes . " " I do n't know what you 're talking about , " Carol said , a hard edge returning to her voice as she sensed some kind of disparagement . " Bobby knows what 's what , do n't you , Bobby ? " " Yes , I want to go now , not when I 'm a daddy . I 'm not ever gon na be a daddy , never never never . I want to go with you this night , now ! " " I think you 've gotten him all upset with your nutty talk , Mr. Moonbloom . We have enough trouble when we want to go out . He gets all overstimulated and then he sleeps badly . Sherman and I come home late , wanting to . . . have a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're alwaysafraid he 'll get up . " " I 'm sorry , " Norman said , looking at the thick cosmetic mask , which made her eyes exceptionally harried and restless . " I hope you have a good time , " he said , somehow frightened by the sight of the child , who stood waving his plump little body as though he were in the midst of a high wind , as though he were whirling so quickly that his gyrations were imperceptible . Norman had an impulse to reach out and touch the boy , to be sure he was there . He raised his hand , and Carol drew Bobby close to her . " He 's all right , Bobby understands , " she said defiantly . " Well , good night , " Nolman said , using the lifted hand for that . Then he went out of there , punched in his vertebrae by whatever it was that abided behind him in the room with the lamp-river and the bulb-fire . And just that much more battered , he pressed the Lublins ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him in preference to the silence of the household he had just left behind . Sarah opened the door but continued talking to someone in her apartment , and for a moment Norman considered leaving before she knew who it was . " Please , please , " she called back over her shoulder to the room from which could be heard Aaron 's angry voice . " Someoneis here , stop for a while . " And she drew Norman in by the arm as she spoke to Aaron , the gesture so intimate and demandingthat Norman had an impulse to dig his feet in stubbornlyand resist . " The door is open , calm down , everyone does n't have to hear . " Aaron 's voice could not be heard then , but the considerable silence made his anger still apparent . Sarah turned to Norman without surprise , though she could n't have seen his face till then , and continued leading him in . " I 'm sorry , " she said shyly , her hand out to encompass the room full of Aaron and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorway , edging furtively in from their exile to their bedroom . Aaron did n't acknowledge him , but continued to stare ferociously at the old man , who sat on a straight-backed chair , his hands folded on his lap and a blithe smile on his rubbery mouth ; he looked like a tough , defiant adolescent , grown old under some chastisement he scorned . " Sit down , Mr. Moonbloom , " she said nervously . And when the old man turned his disparaging face toward Norman , she held one hand out to each of them like a referee calling two fighters to the center of the ring , balancing between a desire to have them shake hands and a concern about keeping them from premature combat . " Fehteh , this is the rent agent , Moonbloom . Here , Mr. Moonbloom , is Aaron 's uncle . Mr. Hirsch. "  | " How do you do , " Norman said , inwardly straining backwardagainst the liquid rings of rage in the room . " I do . . . Esk him how I do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stop it ! " Aaron cried . " You 're pushing me too far , Uncle . Do n't keep pretending I 'm a Gestapo agent . I 've kept you all these years , I would still support you . You can not make me out a brute because I do not want you to crowd in here with us . " " I live with strangers . You are my blood , " the old man said , reading his lines without feeling , merely filling in the parts between Aaron 's speeches . " Besides the fact that we are crowded , that it would be disturbing for the children and for us , the owners would not like such overcrowding . Is there not a rule on this , Moon-bloom ? " But Norman had always been audience and was not used to these experimental dramas in which the audience was asked to participate . He smiled with embarrassment and gave a few short huffs ; he patted his breast , reassured himself that the receipt book was there , licked his lips . " Well-1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I would take up little room ; I am sanitary and quiet , " Hirsch said . " You never tried to live with others , " Aaron shouted . " You have spent years perfecting your suffering . Oh , they have written me , those people you were staying with . They told me how they introduced you to people , how they invited older men and women to the house , made card games , took you to the Community Center , where they had a club for older people . And always you were rude and insulting , laughed at the others . Now you feel you are ready , you havep113refined your martyrdom enough to condemn me . " Aaron 's gray face shone with a sick anger that was so terrible because most of it was directed at himself . He waved his finger , spoke from a twisted mouth ; the hatred in his black , shiny eyes was frightening , and Norman , an outsider by vocation , hoped to be forgotten . Surreptitiously , he slipped the receipt book out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerked her head warningly toward Norman . " So all right , do n't get all fahtumult , " Hirsch said with heavy-lidded blandness , his dessicated body barely defined under his age-greened suit . " What do you have to go crazy ? So I 'm only your father 's brother , only the last relative you have . You do n't have to have me here ; there 's no law . I 'm grateful that you send me a few cents I should n't starve in my little corner among the strangers in Baltimore . I know , I know , it 's a jungle , I do n't expect . Behind me is Hell , ahead of me . . . Eh , at least I 'm peaceful , nobody hits me , I can die in my own good time .

' And if they look surprised , I 'll say , No , do n't blame him , I do n't blame him , he has his own tsoris . ' " " Moonbloom ! " Aaron shouted suddenly  |p114Norman  snapped his head around with the impact . " Is n't it multiple occupancy ? " Aaron demanded harshly . " Can I ? " " They would n't even hear a extra set of footsteps , " Hirsch said to Norman . " I wear slippers in the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in bed after supper and only get up for the bathroom . " The children stood with gaping mouths , suddenly impressed by the familiar figure of the agent . Five pairs of eyes bored into him , and , transfixed , Norman fluttered his hands and shifted his feet . No one had ever made demands on him , he had never been capable of making enemies . He searched in the dusty recesses of his mind for precedents , and came up with only picture post cards of hushed , solitary hours that were all the same though they stood before a variety of backgrounds . He had never asked anything of himself  --  whatthen was there for others to find ? How vivid and large were their faces ! His fingers groped aimlessly for the light , soft , immensely strong coverlet his grandmother had wrapped around him one night when she had cried and given him strawberry ice cream . He smiled and winked and shrugged , but they just waited . " I 'm only the agent , " he said . Not a breeze of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . I mean the owner ... " The old man looked ready to laugh ; he had seen the cash and the fictitious amount written on the receipt , and the way his nephew 's wife had crumpled the receipt up by habit . Norman turned his supplicating palm to Aaron , but could not really be sure what answer he would have preferred . Norman took a deep breath and looked down at his hands solemnly , composing himself for an act of power . " I do n't see why not , " he said . " I 'm sure it would be all right . "  |p115Stillness  , and then a long , shuddery sigh from Aaron . Sarah gave a tiny gasp , and the boy started to pull his sister 's hair in the doorway . Norman looked up to see Hirsch studying the window with a benign expression . " It is terrible that you should come in on a family affair , " Sarah said . " We are not in the habit of . . . " " Enough , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let him go . " " I 'm sorry to intrude myself , " Norman said severely . " You asked me something and I answered . " Alerted by old instinct , Aaron covered his rudeness . He stood up with a slight , false smile that was worn thin by much use . " Of course , I did not mean to imply . . . That is , I appreciate your allowing . . . " " I do n't want to intrude , " Norman said . " I just . . . " " I understand , " Aaron bleated . " You are very kind to ... " " No , no , it 's nothing , " Norman said , feeling he would like to jump through the window , but frozen there by the horrid amenities . " These things are very complicated , " Aaron said . " I understand . " " No , no , it is my place to . . . " " Of course . " Suddenly Hirsch 's dry old voice smacked mockingly at both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , saw mutually the incredible blight he was , and then turned from each other . Sarah led Norman through the wrecked air to the door . Behind him he could hear the children jumping up and down in the bedroom . He went out the door without looking at Sarah , without responding to her soft , timid " Good-by . " Neither Schoenbrun , Katz and Sidone , nor the Spragues were home . He went out of the building trying to figure outp116how he would plan his calls to adjust to that break in his routine . For a while , in the darkening street , he was able to be only mildly irritated by the simple problem , but then , as other things began to crumble in him , that slight disordering of his usual pattern suddenly seemed to undo him . He stopped next to a street lamp and put his hand to his head . " I do n't know , I do n't know , " he said in a shocked voice to the evening.  |p117STILL  HOLDING FEEBLY to the idea that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakened condition , he had taken two sleeping pills last night . Now he walked up the Mott Street stairs with the Seconal drowsiness that bore a surface resemblance to his old calm . Indeed , in the few seconds while he waited for Basellecci to answer the door , he almost convinced himself that the day would be like the flat screenings of old . Yesterday was buffered by the barbiturate , wrapped and muffled like an unpleasant dream . He preparedhis bland smile . But the Italian teacher 's face was shot through with gray , and Norman had a premonition that today would be worse . " Come in , " Basellecci said curtly . " I am just pouring the coffee . " Norman sat down with his back to the open door of the toilet chamber . " I 'm getting so I look forward to your coffee , " he said . " That is very well , " Basellecci answered grimly . " But I may not be well enough to serve you soon . I have been to the doctor , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The wall ? " Norman asked with a sigh . " The wall . " " I 've been meaning . . . " " Yes , yes , sure , you 've been meaning . The doctor says Ip118have an obstruction inside the rectal . This is no longer psychosemantic , it is not figmet of my imagination . " " The coffee is , as usual , delicious , " Norman said appealingly . " It is practically all I live on lately , all I can keep down . " " Are you that ill ? " Norman asked , appalled . " What do you think I have been exclaiming of with such vi-o-lence ? There , there is my oppressor ! " Basellecci cried , pointing to the toilet , his face working so strenuously that Norman would not have found anything inappropriate in his words if he had said " J'accuse ! " The flesh beside his nostrils was white , his mouth scored by vertical lines of arid pain . " I have given great appeals to you , I have considered you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your polite little smile , have nodded at me as were I a shallow-leveled moron , have humored me and said , I will see what can be done , Mr. Basellecci , I will look into it . ' I charge you , I charge you with the fate of my bowels ! " The need to smother his hysterical impulse to laugh made Norman almost as angry as his tenant . He pushed the coffee cup away from him and stood up . " I 've been sick myself , Mr. Basellecci . You do n't know what things I have on my mind . There are a million things to do in this and the other buildings I take care of . I have n't meant to humor you . Only I must put things off in order to organize what has to be done . You only see your problems , naturally . But I have a couple of dozen other tenants . I have limited funds , and it 's a problem for me to try and figure out how to repair things . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act as an antidote to Basellecci 's anger . Deeper than his pain , Basellecci was essentially a man of reason ; indeed , reason had cast him into his blandly lonely life . He held up his hands placatingly.  | " Yes , of course , I become carried off . One forgets that things exist outside of yourself . You live alone and you become susceptible to obsessions . I admit , things get out of disproportion , magnified . There is a selfishness involved , thinking only of yourself . I lie in bed in the other room and I think about that wall . I become enraged . I start to think about the priest in Italy who persecuted me when I was a child , who held me up to scorn because I argued with his word . I think about the . ruffians who molested me because I wished to study and be gentlemanly , about the coarse girls who questioned my manhood because I was fastidious , about the unclean little politicians who made me crawl for a passport because I had no friends or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make fun of my English and my unknowing of the baseball players . And it is brought to me of how difficultly it is to dwell within dignity , to construct something of gracefulnessand beautifulness . And I begin and end with that . . . that wall . It is the gateway to the ugliness for me , and it followsme even to the farthestmost limitation of the city , notwithstanding how distant . " He spread his arms wide , as though to glide on the current of his words , and his face traced the frailest draft of humor and self-denigration . " So you see . . " Yes , I see , " Norman said with some stress ; for the first time it occurred to him that sooner or later he would have to deal with that wall . " No , no , I do n't feel like any coffee , " he said to Basellecci 's silent offer of the banished cup . And then , when the Italian teacher shrugged with an almost smug expression of martyrdom , Norman qualified harshly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just that my system is still out of kilter from my sickness . Coffee gives me heartburn . " Basellecci nodded , deadpan . " And so . . . " He gesturedp120at the toilet chamber without turning toward it , his eyes half closed . " You perhaps really will ... " " Yes , " Norman said from between his teeth . " Yes yes yes yes ! " " Ahh , " Basellecci replied , his ailing smile more than Normancould bear . " I mean , man , this one broad is really taking me far , " Jerry Wung said , watching Norman 's face . " She likes to have a nigger and a Chink work on her at once , me on the bottom and him on top . And that 's not all ; last night she called me up and we like did it over the phone ! What it is , she begins to talk . . . " Why are you telling me all this ? Am I supposed to applaud , or what ? " Norman said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just like a discussion of sex , you know . " Wung was smiling , but seemed to be running out of oxygen , for he breathed with his mouth wide open . " Are you shocked , is that what it is ? " " No , I do n't care one way or the other , " Norman said , faithful to the act of writing out the receipt . " Is n't it sick ? " Wung could have found relief even in condemnation . " I mean , wow , if my family ever could have seen the way I live ! They were real greenhorn Chinks , quiet , calm . They never yelled at the kids . It was like you just could n't do anything wrong no matter how you tried . Like they had some kind of invisible spell . They even died quiet . Man , it killed me how they died . I felt like sticking them with pins to make them yell , to make them scream dirty words and thrash around . I mean , I hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me out of those kooky eyes . Sound strange for me to say that ? I know , I know . I look in the mirror at myself and it shakes me up . I do n't know whatp121my old man and old lady were , what went on in them . I got out on the streets here and I did n't talk their language . They used to just touch me like , that 's all . My brothers and sisters used to dig it , but it was just spooky to me . Most Chinese kids are well adjusted like , you know ? I used to feel like the ugly duckling , like I had the wrong face and the wrong address . I do n't see my brothers and sisters . It 's mutual . Hey , I just wonder if the old lady and the old man could have stayed calm under those queer old faces if they knew what I 'm doing now . I mean it just was n't human the way they died and looked at me , so contented , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those cats were n't real . I dream about them at night , and it 's like nightmare . I grab some broad 's boobs and get real rough , and it 's like I 'd like to wake them old Chinks up . I went to an analyst last year , when I was working more regular , told him about the dreams and my screwy sex life . Ah , but it was a waste of money . I drew a bum head-shrinker . He got so interested that he forgot to take notes  --  a regular voyeur . " Wung slashed his mouth with a violent smile and went ranging around the room . " Not that I do n't enjoy myself ; I do n't want you to think that . I mean , I would n't have it any other way . I got this new bitch now , and she 's got something really novel .... " Norman got up and walked to the door ; in that moment he grasped a new emotion and , fearing to look at it , pocketed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moonbloom , " Wung called beseechingly . " You 're a good Joe . Lemme fix you up one night , hah ? I mean , we could have a ball . It would be better with you along , it would help a lot . How ' bout it , hah ? " He hung in the air over his body , haunting himself , his face full of appeal . " I do n't , ca n't . . . We 'll talk about it some other ... Before nausea overtook him , he slammed the door . Then hep122stood in the dark hallway wondering why a simple " No " should have been impossible to summon right then . " I still have to pour a potful of water into the toilet to make it flush , " Sheryl Beeler said . " It 's a little disgusting , you know ? " Norman nodded as a round stone plopped into his lower body with a disturbingly lascivious effect . " There 's a million things , " he said , watching old man Beeler walk slowly out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflecting a queer joke . " You married ? " Sheryl asked , dropping down on the couch so that her heavy breasts bounced . She lit a cigarette and then blew the smoke in a fan-shaped cloud toward him . " Noo-o , " he answered , trying to make it wry ; it came out like a wail . " Confirmed bachelor . " " I bet you 've got a whole stable of girls though . " She ran her hand down the silken sleeve of her kimono , raising the hairs on Norman 's body , among other things . She was too ridiculously obvious . Who was she buttering up and for what ? He saw himself too clearly for even clever flattery . And yet his desires were new and graceless , and they made him mentally clumsy . He chuckled pathetically and said , " Aw , no , you have the wrong . . . " " The money , " Sheryl said , jumping to her feet . She went to a table and slid some bills out from under a doily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed his hand . " How about a date ? " he barked at the pressure . Sheryl giggled and bumped cutely against him . " My , my , you 're a fast worker . You quiet ones . " Her weight pushed him against the door , and he gave a short , phlegmy chortle . " No , I only . . . " We 'll talk about it , huh , " she said , squeezing him out through the half-closed door . " Maybe next time . "  |p123In  the hallway he squeaked and stared at the air with horrified amusement . " Good God , " he whispered . " I 'm like a child . " And then , still dazed by his spasm of idiocy , he began to straighten the bills to put them into his wallet . Something rational rose up through him , and he counted the small bills . Five dollars short . He started to turn to the door , his knuckles raised to knock . And then knowledge sprouted in a sick smile on his mouth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money in his wallet , his face that of a long-suffering parent . Kram limped away from him . " I slipped on the steps , " he said , shielding with his warped body the drawer from which he took the money . " It 's a crime , that hallway , no light at all . I could have broken my neck if . . . " His coldly tranquil eyes showed a spark of disorder , and the remembrance of that repellent moment was convertedto anger at the unimportant hallway . " I have a good mind to sue you . You would n't like a judge having this place described to him , would you ? " " I 'm sorry you hurt yourself , " Norman said , afflicted by the unusual sight of a splotch of paint on the normally immaculatedrawing table ; it was like a grievous wound in that room . " Do n't be sorry , " Kram said icily . " Just put some lights in that hallway , or I 'll sue , that 's all . " Suddenly Norman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he wanted to say , " Wait , wait , I 'm not really laughingat you . " But Kram , normally immune to laughter , was not himself either . " Do you think it 's funny ? Are you daring me to make trouble ? " he snarled . " No , no , " Norman said , realizing it was not that funnyp124anyhow . " I was just remembering how , a few weeks ago , I asked you if you had any complaints and you said you did n't and I remarked how you seemed to be the only one who did n't . " " " And that strikes you as funny ? What an odd sense of humor you have , " Kram replied , merely irritated now . " One of my other tenants said that I was essentially humorless . " Norman looked out of the window in the general direction of Sugarman . " But when I think about it , it occurs to me that no one is really humorless . Only some people 's jokes are so private ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who acted like a dreamer . " You have to look out that you do n't offend people with your private jokes . Not that jokes bother me , understand . I mean if I did n't start out with some kind of sense of humor . . . Well , you know what I mean . " Norman turned to him , and for a moment everything that was between people and that made intercourse bearable fell away from him . He saw the deep bruise in the man 's spirit ; with remarkable vision he glimpsed the hunchback in all sizes , from the damaged embryo to now . And in that brief clarity , anything less than naked honesty seemed impossible . In a blurred voice , he said , " You mean because of your body . " Kram only opened his mouth slightly , but his eyes crumpled with light . And within the confines of that narrow patch of nakedness , Norman could see the twin prongs of revulsion and offering . They stood in the morning sunlight  --  one straight and frail with something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oversized hat had left its shadow after he had removed it ; and the other new also to such a light , groping for what he had learned to despise in his fight top125survive , exposed down to the distorted skeleton , and afraid as he had never been before . And all of it took less than a minute , so they both learned that time was unmeasurable , except in fantasy . The building stank around them , seemed to settle slightly , as though it were planted in unimaginable muck . Perhaps a howl went up between them ; they would not remember afterward . " I ca n't afford to get hurt , " Kram said in a hoarse voice . " I have no one to . . . There has always been only me . If I could n't go out to get those photographs , if anything happened to my hands . . . " He strained upright , and his face stretched with an expressionless agony . " It 's not death I worry about , " he said . And Norman , out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he had said and what he had been given back . " I 'll do something about the hallway . I 'll have lights put in , " he said in a threatening voice . " It 'll be as light as day in the hall , brighter even . There 'll be a problem with the lights blinding you . " " There 's no need for you to ... " " No , that 's all right , " Norman said , observing his own frenzy with bewilderment . " I 'll do it , I 'll do it . " And he left Kram chewing on the air , lost in his own perfectlyclean apartment , the nudes for some gent 's magazine waiting for his final touch and reflecting the shine of the light from a window that opened only on an air shaft . Wade Johnson and son were throwing a football the length of their living room . Norman ducked as Wade Junior 's wobbly pass came at his head , and then grimaced slightly for his timidity as Wade snatched it out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wade said without looking at him . " No , no , Wadey boy , grip it tight and not so near thep126end . Okay now , let 's see a jump pass . " He underhanded it to the boy , who took a serious grip on the ball , fended off an imaginary tackler , and then jumped and threw . The ball hit Norman in the center of the mouth . " I 'm sorry to be in your way , " Norman said bitterly , swallowingthe salt of his split lip and feeling the blood run down in a thin stream over his chin . The boy looked dreamily sad and muttered a shy apology as he scuffed the floor with his foot . But Wade laughed and said , " My God , he bleeds ! Norman , I feel closer to you now . " " Just give me the rent , " Norman said , holding a handkerchief to his lip and feeling an odd grief for himself . " I do n't want to see any football games , I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go . " " Poor Moonbloom , you are n't going anywhere . Wade Junior and I are going  --  you 'll abide . Hey , Norman , I have n't been to school for three days , called in sick . Soon they 'll can me , and the boy and I will be heading west . Probably pull out owing you a few weeks ' rent  --  just for appearances . Yeah , we 're gon na go by way of Wisconsin , where we 'll see his mother 's grave . Wade 's always been curious about what kind of view she 's got . Then to Colorado ... " " Listen , you idiot , you 'll pay your rent or I 'll have you thrown out . You do n't amuse me and you probably do n't even amuse your son . You 're a phony , a poseur , and the only thing you could act convincingly would be what you are  --  a bum ! " But it was only a flash fire , lit by the shock of physical injury , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his disgust was as much for his own outburst as for Wade 's nonsense . " Heyy-y , Norman , " Wade said in amazement . " What 's come over you ? I declare , I detected a tiny glimmer of passion inp127you just then . Could it be that the man from the lower depths is coming out into the light ? No more underground , no more remote control . Look at him , look at him , Wadey , he 's stirring , his blood is bothering him . See those intelligent eyes , almost human . Oh , if he could only speak , imagine the things he could tell us ! " " You 're really clever , Wade . Too bad you 're afraid to demonstrate it anyplace but in here with the captive audience of your kid . " " Ah , very good , you little bastard . I 've never seen you put up your fists before . I feel it 's all my doing , I 'm a regular Pygmalion . Or could it be a Frankenstein ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , for Christ 's sake , " Norman said wearily , still able to touch ground with his toes . " Give me the money . " " No , no , do n't regress now . Make me give it to you , " Wade said , standing over Norman with his weight-lifter 's body . " Consolidate the little advance you 've made today . " " I swear , if I were a little bigger , I 'd like to . . . " He smiled angrily , impatiently . And suddenly , like a child , Wade wearied of him . He dropped the money on the chair next to Norman 's and picked up the football . " Heads up , Wadey , " he shouted . Norman wrote out the receipt , pocketed the money , and went to the door . For a minute or two he looked back at the man and the boy and the blur of the ball between them . The slatted shadows of the Venetian blinds imprisoned the two figures in separate cages and laid long bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back and forth the ball went , spinning something not quite invisible between them while the man murmured encouragement and the boy grunted with effort . And then , in the same rhythm as his encourage/ment , Wade began to murmur something else , and Norman closed the door on it in bafflement , still hearing it in the hallway . " Little lady mouse , Rosy in a ray of blue , Dame souris trotte : ( Little Lady Mouse ) Debout , parresseux ! ( Up now , all of you ! ) ( Verlaine ) " Norman moaned , seeing Wade elude him like a sorcerer . It occurred to him for the first time that he might be inadequatefor this job too . If a man of five foot seven and a hundred and thirty-eight pounds could lumber , he lumbered up the stairs to Leni Cass 's door . " Enter , Moonbloom , " she said too gaily . " I was just mixing myself a bourbon , and bourbon and I hate to drink alone . " " No , I do n't want anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following her inside . It seemed to upset her , and she gave a brittle laugh that whitened her face slightly . " Well , then , I 'll drink alone , " she said . She took a big swallow from a glass with harlequin diamonds on it and watched him silently write out the receipt , her big eyes somewhat frightened . " Uh , Norman , about the rent ... " He looked up so suddenly that she almost jumped . " It just happens that things got a little loused up this week , and I 'm  --  how is it said ?  --  financially embarrassed . " He stared at her , unable to articulate to her what she was really piling on him . And his look was as cold as possible because he was stunned by the speed with which the subtle conspiracy was being consummated.  |p129She  could n't have known that , of course , and so was just shaken by an expression she had never expected from him . " Do n't you have any comment on that ? " she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay the rent ? " " Well , I 've had a little trouble lining things up , and exhubby'scheck is ... " " What do you want me to do ? " he asked in a flat voice . " You 're not acting like you . This is embarrassing for me , but of all times for you to turn stranger . I never asked you before ... . " I wish you had  --  before . " " Well , what should I do ? What are you going to . . . " " All right , " Norman said , getting up . " What can I do ? " She followed him to the door , trying to thank him , but he had no patience left for graciousness . " Do n't thank me , I 'm not happy about it . " " Oh , " she said in a small voice behind him , unable to afford anger or self-respect . He heard her close the door quietly with an excess of humility and abasement , and that angered him further . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , her Mother Goose face slightly soured by resentment . " It 's been a long time . It 's like you do n't feel you have to , so you do n't . Well , I suppose I ca n't force you . You know quite well that J. T. and me ca n't just move out or anything . I just put it up to your conscience is all . " She turned to the chair where J. T. sunned himself in a small amber beam of afternoon light . J. T. coughed profoundly , the sound not brought out , but resounding broadly from within like a threatening volcano . " I 've been sick myself , " Norman barked . " I 'm putting thingsp130in order , trying to get caught up . I said I would take care of it . You 'll just have to wait your turn . " " Oh , we 'll wait , " she said sarcastically . " I do n't know what you think I 'm running here , " Norman said . " It 's ridiculous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agent , you know . You all seem to expect me to get down on my knees and start plumbing and hammering . What did the last agent do for you ? Do n't tell me all these things just started to go wrong when I took the job . I bet the last agent did nothing . I bet he was n't hounded like this . What is there about me that makes you all think I 'm going to be able to renovate everything from top to bottom ? " For a few seconds she appeared intimidated by his unusualoutburst , amazed too . But then an element of slyness crept over her face ; she had discovered a promising weakness in him , and she cast her eyes downward and spoke forlornly to her right toe . " No , no , that 's true ; the other agents never did anything for us . Nobody ever has . People like us .. . Well , we just do n't have recourse . Oh , you 're right , we 're just lucky to have a dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chair and a bed to . . . " Norman stared at her with a quiver of anger . From the chair the Vesuvian rumble began . The late light struck the colored-glass shade of the old lamp and cast pale lozenges of red and blue on the ivory-lace covering on the table . All around was such a dustiness , a mustiness , a sense of antique intimacy , that he almost imagined a smell of old people 's underwear ; he could visualize the two of them naked under the yellow light of a bare bulb with their ruining bodies slowly , sluggishly seeking a furtive ease , the painter 's chest crunching from the exertion , her mouth making a silently horrified " Oh my . "  | " You do n't have to talk like that , " he said weakly . " I said I would ... " " And the warped window in the bedroom , " she said , exactingmore and more as his grip loosened . " And the missing tiles in the bathroom , and the falling plaster over the fridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , writing on the inside cover of the receipt book . " Warped window , tiles , plaster . " " Because all those things upset J. T. , and when he gets upset he coughs to beat the band , and I just know you would n't want that on your conscience . " She moved closer to him as she spoke , and he backed away , still writing , suddenly afraid to look up at her . " I 'm sure that you 're not like the other agents , " she said . " I can see by your face . " At first , use Moeller noticed nothing different about his face . She moved about the room in a green-knit dress , waiting for him to write out the receipt , touching personal things with her peculiarly heavy hands , smiling unattractively . " Here he is again , " she said in her tart voice . " On his mission , so dedicated , so businesslike . " Why had she come to this city , she wondered for the thousandth time . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their sly , melancholy faces , sleepy looking , bored , hiding accusation behind eyes thousands of years old in the art of secrecy . There were other eilies , where Jews were in a tiny minority , where you could go for weeks , months even , without seeing one . An inner spasm went through her in Norman 's presence ; she recognized it as revulsion and it made sense to her . " A miniature Rothschild , eh , Moonbloom ? What was it you said you were  --  a bookkeeper before ? It is a natural talent , adding and sub- . tracting . It makes you strong . " " What are you talking about ? " he asked coldly . " Are youp132trying to be humorous ? " He looked at her with dull eyes , holding the receipt out to her without moving , demanding that she take it from him . " You seem to be not in a good mood , Moonbloom . Do I rub you in the wrong manner ? " She sounded almost hopeful , gazing with morbid interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get your joke , " he said harshly . " Perhaps you 'd better try your humor on someone else . " Ah , she thought , noting with satisfaction the little threads of blood on the inner walls of her body , he is human , he does feel something oppressive in me . Her smile was like that of a victim of Bell 's palsy , her mouth creeping up one side of her face so extremely that it seemed her flesh might split . " See , now it comes out , " she said gaily . " You denied it before , but it is revealed . You do dislike me after all . " There was something noxious about her face . She was an exceptionally clean person ; you could tell she scrubbed her face almost raw , because her skin had an abraded look ; her clothes were always spotless , and Norman had never seemed to notice any smell in the room . It had given the apartment a curious quality of emptiness . Now , for some reason , he sensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way but which reached directly to his brain and filled him with revulsion . " I do n't understand you , " he said carefully . " You seem eager for me to dislike you . " " Oh no , that is a strange thing to . . . I , of course , am only . . . teasing " She seemed unnerved by his very simple deduction and covered her breasts with crossed arms , shaking her head in mild reproof . " You seem to have a very poor sense of ... " " Humor , " he supplied . " Yes , that seems to be the consensus . " He stared for another few seconds at her , then jerked hisp133head sideways impatiently and went to the door . " We seem to talk at odds . " She had no response to that , but only stood covering her torso and staring at him with glittering eyes , fascinated by something just beneath his hairline . He nodded and left her , somehow scalded by the aftervisionof the green of her dress.  |p134KARLOFF  'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , walking on stiff , tottery legs . With his great hunched size , his movement had the frightful majesty of a wounded elephant . Norman held his breath until the old man sank with a grunt onto the chair . " Ehr gehocked off en mine tier , deh fashtunkenah momser , " he growled , running his eyes suspiciously up and down Norman'sbody . " Who , Mr. Karloff , who beat on your door ? " " Ahh , " the old man said , nodding , his down-pulled mouth fighting upward toward a faint smile . " Who , who ? Ich nays , dun come close , he should think I am through . And then  --  grab him by throat , take him along ahlso ! " His eyes peered out savagely , slyly , like those of a beast waiting in a thicket for the man who has wounded him . " Was one of the other tenants bothering you , banging on your door ? " Karloff tossed his hand derisively . " Dem , " he snorted . " Dey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ? " Norman asked , gazing at the decaying mask . " Who , yes , who ? " Karloff suddenly grinned , causing an explosionin the network of lines on his dark face . Dismayed , Norman made a face . Karloff thought it was Death who had knocked on his door . Caught in the whorlsp135of senility , he planned to seize that which would seize him . What shape did the intruder have for the old man ? Norman looked at the massive gnarled strength in the ancient hands , the veins hard and black under the loose , liver-colored skin , and he shuddered for the human being Karloff might mistake for his one enemy . God help Del Rio or Paxton if they trespassed ! He himself kept the table between them as he wrote out the receipt and took the damp bills . Then he looked around at the room , which seemed to be melting into a solution of filth . Whole families of roaches trooped across the walls . Here and there were clottings of now unidentifiable food remains , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarming mass of tiny ants in the cubed conformation of the sugar they were devouring . " Mr. Karloff , " he said in a firm voice , " I do n't think I would have the heart to put you out of here , although that would be the sensible thing . This place is the most revolting mess I have ever seen . The whole building will be condemned . Perhaps you are not capable any more , but . . . Karloff brayed mockingly , his purplish mouth opened wide . " But I 've just made up my mind about something . I am going to have this place cleaned , maybe painted . I 'm going to tear down those curtains and burn them with your bed-ding . " Karloff began laughing , almost silently , his eyes narrowed so they appeared to be just two more lines in the crowded road map of his face ; his large hand slowly beat the time to his amusement . " I 'm not kidding ! " Norman said loudly , feeling anger pumped into him with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the old man rasped , rocking , beside himself in his almost soundless laughter . " Listen to him , duh graysa mench . . . oy , oy . . . ah reguhla . . . eee-e . . . ah re/guhla Tartsen fuhn deh apes ! " And now his laughter broke thickly , lumpily out of him ; it rolled around the room and poured over Norman , who became wild with an emotion he thought was rage . " You 'll see , you 'll see , Karloff , " he cried , standing near the door and sweeping the room with his hand . " I 'll scrub this place to the bare wood . I 'll burn the rubbish and disinfect the floors and walls . I 'll take every piece of food out of here and see that you only have enough to eat . I 'll paint the walls white , I 'll scrub right around your chair , and you 'll be the only dirty thing in here . This place will be so shiny it 'll blind you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He seemed to be floating on a swift rush of something , and he flailed without sense or reference . " On Mott Street I 'll put in fluorescents in the hallways as bright as arc lights . I 'll rip out Basellecci 's wall , I 'll fix stove burners and faucets and elevators and wiring . I 'm sick and tired of all this ridiculous ... " And suddenly he was staring at the old man 's puzzled face and he was stunned by his own echoing insanity . He tried shaking his head , attempted a smile of sorts ; his head kept ringing dementedly . " It 's just that I . . . I mean , there has to be some order . I 'm going to . . . to clean up . I have to . . . . " Karloff shrugged helplessly , and Norman looked at the floor . " I mean it , " he said . Then he spun around and went out of the reeking room , Karloff temporarily immobilizedbehind him . " Do you know , " Sugarman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that last night my manhood slipped away from me . I could not summon the rod of my virile office , and instead was landlord to a dead and harmless worm who lay upon my belly like the crudep137likeness on a mummy case . I was the victim of a coarse woman 's scorn and laughter . That was less than nothing . But the demise of something valuable , which I had not yet determined the extent of  --  that was the mortal blow . The logarithms of life are written in exceedingly small numerals ; what chance have you at answers when the pointer has softened to the consistency of melting rubber ? Can I find my way without the needle to the compass ? I have visited the shores of melancholia often in my errant life , indeed it is home port for me . But always there was my rod , my staff to comfort me . One thing made me a positive creature . I could enter things , could plug into mysterious sources of power . In the times of dire emptiness I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetuating Sugarman , of extending his raucous cry over the track-bound carcass of this America . I might be buried like a dormant root , but my fruit would spring up through the cinders of the roadbeds and the prone ladder of the ties . I had always had that vague trump card of life . But last night I played it and it was revealed to be a blank , an unprinted piece of paper . She laughed , that Lysol-smelling tart , laughed and farted hysterically . So , this is what I present to you today , Moonbloom . I pay you in the same small change , but there is no warmth in the payment ; you might just as well pick pennies from a dead man 's eyes . " Through the disorder of his own recently tumbled nerves , Norman looked at the morose , yet stubbornly vigorous , face of the candy butcher , and he felt a trio of impulses : irritation was tepid and came in the thickest stream , but there was the cold trickle of pity , and , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of irresistible laughter . He snorted , hissed , finally brayed . " Oh , Christ . . . Sugarman . . . what the devil . . . ohp138for . . . " He held on to the table and shook , surprised at a physical relief . Through watery eyes he beheld his tenant 's miserable and outraged face . He was mortified at the excess of his own voice . The room rang , and it was strange to him , because he had never laughed like that before ; his fascinationwith the phenomenon perpetuated it . Sugarman sat like an affronted rock . If only he would smile , or display positive anger . But he just sat there , parodying himself , mournful , self-pitying , wretched , yet richly abundant . Finally Norman flopped onto a chair and wiped his eyes with a handkerchief , shaking his head to rid himself of the hysteria . " I entertain you ? " Sugarman said in a cold , delicate voice . " You have the humor of those who made lamp shades from human skin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy of the irrevocable , of the end of something  --  end , end ! Is there a more frightful word ? And you , you dry pod of a bookkeeper , you crustacean with ball-point claws  --  you laugh , just laugh . You are worse than I. " " I do n't know what you want from me , " Norman said . " You spill yourself to me . I do n't ask for these intimacies . I 'm the agent , I collect the rents . This whole setup is a madhouse . Did you give these great speeches to the agent who had the job before me ? What deludes all of you people into thinking that I 'm interested ? " He sat very still now , suddenly feeling something in his grasp , his eyes intent on the florid face before him , noting the small , burst blood vessels that gave Sugarman 's face a spurious outdoor look . " All us people , " Sugarman repeated , stumbling over Norman'sunexpected rejoinder . " Because . . . because you have a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look in the mirror ? There is something masochistically inviting in the center of your raccoon eyes . Like the little square of confectionp139in Alice in Wonderland , there is written all over you Eat Me . I know that with me I rant and rave in moving trains , deaf to my own voice and blind to the laughing faces . Only in here , in solitude , my voice rises to sound , and I wait for anyone to listen . And then you come along in your dark suit and vest and your pin in your lapel and your Al Capone hat , and you are like a queer microphone into which my pent-up words can pour . To what purpose ? God knows . Perhaps we all wish to be inscribed upon something . Maybe it has to do with perpetuating our silly little consciousnesses . If we are wrong , it is the fault of your face  --  it is a fraud . Change your face , Moonbloom , or else listen and do something for us . " " What do you want me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right , I 'll do , I 've promised to do things . What is your complaint ? Do you want wall-to-wall carpeting , a stall shower , air conditioning ? Is something broken ? Name it , do n't be shy . No one else is . Make a demand on me . A refrigerator , a paint job , what ? " " No , no , Moonbloom , it is not so easy . Man does not live on fringe benefits alone . What I want from you . . . " He stared musingly at the floor . And Norman , the dread rising in him at the thought of some unimaginable request , scooped the money from the table and poured it into his pocket as he rushed to the door . " Wait , wait , what are you running away from ? " Sugarman called after him . Norman waved in panic , and his answer was cut in two by the closing of the door . " That 's why I 'm running . . . " Slam . " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said nothing to Paxton , who , fortunately , was too busy working to do more than indicate the money in a litter onp140the table . Norman counted out the rent , left the receipt , and went upstairs to Louie . " I was suppose to go to that movie , " Louie said , " but I come down with a bug . Had a little fever . I 'm drinking a lot of juices and all . I did n't miss any work though . Went in with a hundred point three . They promoted me a little . I answer the phones now and only do a little delivering . Kind of keep a eye on things . That 's because of Ralph . Ralph 's okay ; it 's Sal is the wise guy . If it was n't for Ralph I woulda ... " " I do n't know what you 're talking about , " Norman said tersely . His cruelty was turned on himself though , as he took away with him the dimly hurt face of the man , standing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flickeringits ignored performance , something bland cooking on the stove . The windows rattled slightly in the cold evening ; Louie stood like the victim of a thrown custard pie , gaping , injured , forever lost to the joke . " I ony was sayin ' . . . " The rest of his plaint was lost to the closing of the door and distance ; yet that fragment drew itself out as fine as the tapered sound of wind drawn through the finest of cracks and crevices . It was like a thin spray of lacquer and served to fix the small simian face of Louie on Norman 's brain as he rushed out into the December darknessof cold wind and stone and stars . " I am no longer Norman Moonbloom , " he said aloud in the great privacy of the city night . And then , seeing the floral brilliance of windows and distant sign lights , he was suddenly confronted with a more terrible possibility , which made him bite the windy blackness and gasp , " Or I never was . "  |p141GAYLORD  CALLED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there had been a small fire in the Lublins ' apartment . For the first time in his adult life , he rushed out into a businessday without a tie and without shaving , only to find upon his arrival that such disturbing impulsiveness ( like all impulsiveness , in his opinion ) had not been necessary . About two square feet of the wall beside the stove was charred , and the wastebasket that stood there was blistered to a colorless gray . The little girl stood behind her mother with wide , frightened eyes , biting silently on her guilt , while Sarah Lublin lied unhappily . " Of course the stove is defective , " she said . " I attempted to light the burner and a sheet of fire went up , caught on the drape and . . . started to burn . I called the superintendent when I heard him with the ash cans , and together we put it out . " She studied Norman 's face . " It is a menace . It should be repaired . " " A sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Gaylord muttered disgustedly behind him . They all stood in the kitchen  --  Aaron , the old uncle , the little boy , each eying the black smear of the wall with a different contemplative expression , like people studying an unusual natural phenomenon . Only Gaylord looked bored ; he knew better , but did n't have it in him to side with landlords . He leaned on the cabinet that separated the kitchenp142from the dinette , blowing softly over his thumbnail . Norman squinted at the burned wall , searching for an attitude . He had responsibility , no matter who he was now . What else was there to hold on to ? He was cut off from the place and time that had at least given him a spuriously familiar shape , and if he relinquished duty , he would be totally lost here in this sunlit kitchen , among the strangely discreet torments of these pale foreign people . He assayed the alternatives . " We do not wish to make trouble , " Aaron said confidently ; he was professional and poised with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among his own . " If you would just check the stove and make some adjustment for the paint , I will be glad to paint the kitchen myself . " Norman darted his eyes to him , swiftly moved them to the uncle , who might have been the weak link . But Hirsch , an enemy of sorts to his nephew , was conditioned to larger , outside enemies . " It 's a fire hazard , " Hirsch said blandly . " Your whole buildingcould burn . " Sarah 's lips were tight , and the morning sunlight grouped her solidly with her family ; they had endured worse interrogations . Their skins were sickly white , and yet strong , absorbent . How was it that he had never encountered people like these tenants ? His eye fell on the little girl . " Do you play with matches ? " he asked suddenly , feeling the exhilaration of righteous cruelty . The girl looked up at her mother in supplication , the tears starting from her eyes . Sarah pushed her out of the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just shrugged , smiled , and followed after her , too old to be concerned about anything less than ultimate defeat . Aaron tried to spread his body over Sarah and the boy , but Sarah ,  |p143with  sudden determination , shoved him and said , " Go see to Ruthie . " She must have given him a significant glance , because he went , his back somehow defeated looking . " Please , " she said to Norman and Gaylord . Gaylord waved both hands at her and left too . " It is difficult here , with the old man . We have tension . We are nervous people , you un-derstand . " Norman nodded firmly . " Your little girl did it , did n't she ? " " She did n't know , " Sarah whispered harshly . " She wished to boil water for tea  --  to surprise me . " " The stove was n't defective . I could see by the wastebasket that it started in there . She dropped a match in there . " " Yes , yes , but please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so upset about , " he said . " I 'm not going to do anything to you . The damage is slight . " " You will have it painted ? " " Me ? I 'm sorry , you 'll have to take care of that yourself . " " We are so short of money . . . . " " Well , then , leave it as it is until you have some extra money . " " I ca n't , " she cried desperately . " Why not ? " " I can not explain it to you . " " Look , I do n't understand any of this . All I know is that the bills are piling up . I 've promised to do a lot of things . I 'm going to . I 'm going to fix your sink ; I do n't know how but I am . Now you expect me to paint your kitchen too . Some things are impossible . There 's a limit . If you only knew the finances of this setup . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What is so terrible about your leaving the wall like that for a while ? " Sarah 's look embarrassed him , made him feel he was being measured , and he worried perversely that he might be foundp144wanting . In the other rooms he could hear the soft , mouselike sounds of the family being quiet . The old , lumpy putty on the window glistened and made the room seem like a cave . " I can not stand the signs of the fire , " she said slowly , placing each word in him like a dart . Her eyes were like mirrors , and he saw a tiny Norman Moonbloom in each of them . He smelled the burned odor , but it seemed to come from her . Something made him put his hand up to his tie , but his fingers recoiled at its absence . She looked wild , and he was afraid . " All right , " he said hoarsely . " It 's already beyond reason . Why not ? " " Thank you , " she said with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , " he snarled . She smiled . " Our Lester , " Minna said , " has gotten into trouble , but he knows where to turn . We 'll take care of everything . And when it 's all cleared up , I want to have you come to dinner . You seem like a nice young man , both feet on the ground . I think you 'd be a good influence on Lester . " From the other side , Eva returned coyly , " I 'll bet a lonely young bachelor like you could appreciate a home-cooked meal . " " Everything is going to be all right , " Minna said , starting a new serve . " Oh , he needs us , all right . " Eva , like her sister , did not recognize the manic quality of their conversation . A doctor had agreed to abort the girl , and Lester was sulking safely in his room . The green years of the nephew 's childhood would never end for them , and they remembered how he had looked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ albums that night . Age and loss became distant and unreal , someone else 's blood was only as sad as that which was shed on the other side of the world ; one clucked pityingly but lived on in personal love . " Now you just tell us your favorite menu , Mr. Moonbloom , and we 'll set a date , " Minna cried on the edge of laughter . " And I make pies , " Eva threatened , rolling her leatherenclosedeyes . Norman looked from one to the other of them like a spectatorat a tennis match but with the painful sensation of being the ball . " I mean it pays for a boy to have a family , " Minna said . " Loved ones , " Eva qualified . " People to lean on , " Minna shrieked , speeding up the volley . Norman reeled . " Do n't want him to know , " Betty Jacoby murmured from the dimness as she lay on the couch , sick and hopelessly old . " Must n't let on to the little woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lobby of the apartment . " Just a brief slack period at the place . I can always get a job ; it 's not that . Do n't want her to think I could n't go right out and get a job . You understand . " He winked slyly , his cheery , round face somehow obscene and weird to Norman , who could only nod in the viscosity in which they were submerging him . " Katz is out auditioning , " Sidone said , his fish eyes protrudingbehind the sunglasses . " The leader told him that if he made it , he would let him arrange and all . It 's a big deal , but Katz is counting on it too much . That whacked-up bastard is already apologizing to me for his success . I do n't build up ,  |p146so  I do n't fall down . Trouble is , he does n't want to be a bum . That 's murder when you really are . That poor bastard . Maybe you 'll help me pick up the pieces , Moonbloom ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment , where he was assaulted by Carol 's screaming rage and then hit by an ash tray she had aimed at her husband . " Aghh , " she gargled in fear and disgust . Sherman , and the child too , froze in shock as Norman put his hand up to another wound . His forehead was bleeding , his eyes were blurry . He sat down , completely at a loss . The lamp shade turned slowly , animating the river ; the fake fire consumed something beyond comprehension . Ripples widened from a drowning that had not yet taken place . The child began to cry , and Carol ran from the room . " Let me get you a Band-Aid , " Sherman said dully . " That bitch , she was aiming at me . " He trudged heavily out of the room ; when he came back , the child went into the other room and began throwing blocks savagely ; each block 's impactdetonated a nerve in Sherman 's cheek . " I 'm sorry , " Sherman said in an undertone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin . " " That 's all , " Norman intoned ; he had the sensation of sitting in a rocket with the flames of propulsion already roaringbeneath him . Slowly he raised his eyes to the ceiling , anticipating the impact of the plaster against his head . Sherman'slarge white fingers tangled before his eyes ; he felt the pressure of the Band-Aid against his brow . The rocket pulsed , ready to lift him . " Hurry up , " he said , as still as stone . " Well it was an accident , " Sherman said , breathing Sen-Sen at him . " The whole goddamn thing was an accident , from beginning to end . " His cheek continued to transmit the rhythm of his son 's furious mischief in the bedroom , so thatp147the clockety clock thud seemed a destruction taking place in the bones of his face . " I went with her for two years , and she teased and teased until I thought I 'd flip . Then once , just once , she made a big production when her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Christ 's sake , she probably had it plotted on temperature charts . That one time , and she was knocked up . We got married , we had Bobby . All an accident , see . But oh , that Bobby , he 's a beauty anyhow , he 's a miracle . How can I wish it never happened ? Can you really wish you 'd never been born ? " And Norman , his head hardly hurting , realized that the greater shock had happened to Sherman , and that fact caused him new pain . He could hear Carol Hauser crying furiously in the other room and he noticed that as Sherman became aware of the sound of her crying , a curious , lustful expression came over his face . He leaned away from Norman , crumpling the Band-Aid paper in his hand , his eyes turned toward the sound of her weeping . " Oh that bitch , " Sherman breathed passionately . " Do you see how she is ? Is n't she a hot sketch , that broad ? Is n't she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of love , and when he stood up he appeared to be an actor playing Romeo who has completely lost himself in the part . Norman went out as Sherman entered his wife 's room and closed the door . The child stopped rioting . Everything was still except for the hot , terrible whispering from behind the closed door and the rotating lamp shade and the heatless fire . Ashen and crumpled , Norman went directly home , wondering whether or not he was at the bottom of his fearful descent . In his bed , he lay with the pillow wrapped around his now throbbing head , and he drew a thin thread of comfort from the realization that he probably would n't survive anythingworse.  |p148THE  NEXT MORNING he was forced to seize upon one piece of reality . His head cleared at the sound of Irwin 's voice on the phone , and hand over hand he crept back to a ledge of his former life . " I must say you took me at my word , Norm . I have n't heard from you in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I also have n't gotten any mail from you either . " " Yes , I know , Irwin , " he said , surprised that he still sounded the same . " Things have gotten a little mixed up . All those repairs and . . . well I was sick for a week . " " You 're not letting things get out of hand , are you ? " All this was , was a hole in Irwin 's fourth-best suit , but he had n't gotten to where he was without paying attention to details . " There 's nothing you 're keeping from me ? You know I trust you , Norman . " " Of course , Irwin . " He wondered if he were still recognizablewith the scab on his lip , the too large Band-Aid on his forehead . Never in his former life had he displayed the marks of violence ; it had been like a symbol of his complete disbelief in it . His comfortable association with small talk was gone , and in its place was a growing discomfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sure that sin existed now wondered whether he was involved in it . Would the mirrors of his old house far away reflect him now ? " Are you still there , Norman ? "  | " I 'm not sure . " " Norman ? " " Oh , yes , I was thinking about something else . " " Well do n't . Think about this . Is everything as it should be there ? What is it with the money ? " " As I was saying , Irwin , I 'm just in the process of straighteningthings out . Going to put one of my old studies to a little good use , heh , heh . Do a little complicated accounting and see where I am . You do n't have to worry about a thing on this end , Irwin . Just a matter of sort of inventorying , Irwin . You know how jumbled up these things can get , Irwin . I 'm back in the groove after my recent illness , Irwin . Have everything in apple-pie order by the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irwin , I ... " " Stop with the Irwins ! " Norman looked sickly at the mouthpiece , suddenly feeling like crying for the little heap of himself . " Well . . . what should I call you ? " " Look , this is ridiculous . I 'm going to wait until the first . I still have confidence in you . But if I do n't get some satisfactionby the first of the year . . . Well , I 'll have to really re-examine your status , Norman . After all , this is a business rannana , rannana . We do n't rannana rannana rannana . . . For a moment , Norman had the comforting feeling that he was some two months younger , that all this had n't become a horror . He watched the headless bodies passing along the sidewalk ; he noticed that the last m in Moonbloom was chipping and might soon become an n . Of course the angle of sunlight measured a different hour now , as the days reached the winter ebb . Here was his ball-point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouse ran across the floor  --  a little lady mouse  --  and he was instantly crushed by the immense web that had grown up around him.  | " Irwin , I will ! " he cried fiercely into the phone . Irwin was blown into momentary silence . " I 'm going to take care of the whole goddamned thing ! You wo n't have a thing to complain about . If it kills me , I 'll put things in such order that you 'll be amazed . Now let me hang up because I 'm going to begin . " " All right , sure . . . okay , Norm . " Irwin 's breath became delicate with shock . There was a long stillness in the phone , and Norman realized that Irwin was waiting for him to hang up first . Slowly , with the tremor of power in his hand , he did so . Then he drew some sheets of paper before him , ejected the nib of the ball-point , and began searching the watermark in the paper for the place to begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depths for a beginning and caught a glimpse of it , heard the sound of it , a sort of awful yet uproarious laughter . He began writing : 70th St. : Repair elevatorWiring for house ( Schoenbrun 's air conditioner ) Clean walls ( paint ? ) Paint elevator ( to cover dirty pictures ) Repair loose tiles in lobby floorReplace bulbs in lobbyRepair dripping sink in Lublins ' kitchenPaint out the marks of fire in abovePlumbing ( rusty water ) Mott St. : Basellecci 's wall  --   --  *Repair Beelers ' toiletInstall fluorescent fixtures in hallway ( Kram )  |p1512nd  Ave. : Things beyond my control ?

The paper covered with his small , pretty writing reassured him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own delicately drawn numerals heading each column like officers keeping the ranks disciplined , looked forward to the time when he would be able to add them and , with finality , write the sums . Forgetting his marked face for the moment , he reaffirmed an old belief in codification . The watery winter sunlight could do nothing to his brave list . He smiledand awarded himself a Sunday holiday . Next week he would dig in . Muscles appeared in his body.  |p152His  native town would recognize him . He would take an early train north , and come back Sunday night , refreshed . De Lesseps had nothing on him ; rather late in life , he realized he could build a dozen Suez Canals . The pain in his brow lay slyly dormant.  |p153IT  WAS A LITTLE too warm for his overcoat as Norman walked through the streets of his native town under the fine drizzle . Indeed , there was nothing to suggest the season in the atmosphereof remembered Sunday quiet ; it could have been summer or spring fogged by his memory of the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in familiarity . Yet he was oddly relaxed by the monochrome look of the sedate old buildings . He could hear his own footsteps . The rain-softened edges of roofs , the blur of elm branches against the smoky ivory of sky , the dull shine of the iron railing around the green , and the heavy lift and fall of the flocked pigeons , all had the stillness , the inviolate calm of pictures in an old photo album ; all was sweet and touching , but delicateenough to shape his frail memories in a form too light to elicit pain . He was glad he had come , he thought , anticipating that the day here would show him himself as he really was . It would allow him to hold himself off from the chaos of the recent months , to see his job as no more than a job . A car went by with a swish and a whine of tires ; he smiled in sudden memory of an uncle 's old Essex , whose wooden steering wheel he had manipulated in a solitary game of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it had rested at the back of his uncle 's yard . Full of cheerful sentiment , he peered into the Sabbath-closed coffee shop he hadp154once frequented , and he was moved by the empty cake stands on the counter and the dull sparkle of the grill . Now he crossed and walked along the western perimeter of the green , eying the college buildings and the rusty moss along their foundations . A bus hissed by with lighted windows , and he was warmed by sadness . His face was soothed by the gentle mist . Soon he reached the beginnings of his own neighborhood , and he remarked the quiet homeliness of the Victorian houses . How small it all was ! And then he was in front of his own house , with no feeling of drama , looking at the gray clapboard stained by rain . The familiar windows , that door . My God , he half expected to see Norman Moonbloom come walking out , calling over his shoulder to someone dear inside . For some time he stood there , bemused , comfortably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky upon his heart , only to find with some dismay that , when he closed his eyes , all of it had left no mark he could discern . And then a fat man in a raincoat came out of the house . He stared at Norman blankly . Norman smiled and walked on . " It 's like walking through the past , " he said to himself , enjoying the role of ghost . He passed the junior high school he had attended and of course remembered it as much bigger . Here he had passed from room to room among other children , weighted with books , unsolicited , circumspect , earnest , smilingon the fringes of pushing boys and girls , often thinking he was part of everything that went on , sometimes feeling otherwise . The street widened to contain long blocks of esplanade masted with elms and looking like great green barges sailing into the park at the far end . He passed tall old houses with oval windows in their doors or stained-glass fanlights or shingled towers . He remembered romping here . Romping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly he stopped in the pearly mist as something regrettable struck him ; he was not the ghost here , not now  --  this place and his former life here were ghostlike . No matter how intensely he desired to return to the peace and quiet of the way he had lived most of his life , he was irrevocably cut off . He looked around at the still and shining town in the rain , and his yearning choked him as he realized that the ghastly life of his recent months was all he had . The terrible images of the tenants rose up and strode over the toy landscape , crushing his serene past . And the town did not cry out to him for help , but somehow lumped him with those awful alien figures . What a mistake this had been ! If he had not come back , he might have been able to maintain a dream of his old home , might have used his memory of it to sustain him . How he hated all of them , those grasping , importuning tenants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feeling of grief , he waved down the first bus he saw and rode back through the town . From the lighted bus the streets were grayer , dimmer . The occasional people were like shades , the buildings like tombs . His own house was a blur of nothing ; downtown , with his favorite luncheonette , was an unlighted slide that revealed contours without life . It was a relief to board the train , where the sound of people'svoices and the feeling of movement returned him at least to his body . For a while he watched the landscape sliding by in the early twilight , not thinking about anything ahead or behind . He rode the air without anger or pain or hunger , a sort of mote being sucked toward a great nucleus of noise and size , unanimated , almost peaceful , until the candy butcher came ranting through the car , pouring his lyrical madness over the plush and damp wool and flesh . " Awrange drinks , cheese sandwiches , peanut-butter Nabs ,  |p156ambrosia  , nectar , pate de foie Bras , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Buy now , I accept Diner 's cards and Carte Blanche . Mounds , Nestles , ham sandwiches made with ham from the very finest of Estonian suckling pigs . . . " Sugarman 's eyes lit up like a blue gas flame . " Ah , Moonbloom , you thought to run away ? No dice , little agent ; you are hooked , addicted . The withdrawal pains are worse than everything . Meanwhile , how about a spot of refreshment ? " Norman groaned and steeled himself for what could not be avoided , and the train whistle howled derisively as it sped him back to the city.  |p157IF  ANYTHING , HIS visit home made things worse ; as with pressure on a wound , cessation invigorates pain . The Thursday following was snow-flurried and blustery . Blown along as he was , it seemed more than ever that his schedule was shattered , so that at the end of the day he had the feeling that he had shuttled back and forth between the buildings , seeing one tenant on Mott Street , and one on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thirteenth Street or Seventieth Street , crisscrossing his own tracks , weaving some chaotic web of intention . Basellecci merely looked at him , but the follicles of hair on his head were thin eruptions of pain and something waxy coated his brow and his nose . He handed Norman the money silently , his mild brown eyes thickened , beyond protest . The mouth that doted on the subtleties of pronunciation , and that had never been able to shape his cry for dignity , now had a pursed expression , as though a fine , strong thread were drawing it shut , stilling the appeal he had never been able to make convincing to other people . He stared without anger , without charging Norman , only , more terribly , presentinghimself in the revolting manner of those deformed people who have not the discretion to hide their deformities ; he just stood in the existing light , the toilet chamber an umber unexplainable background for him . Norman attempted to speak , but his words for Baselleccip158had been used up and he mouthed dry air . He gestured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wung was reptilian , his flesh going green , his long , drop-shaped eyes frantic , as though sensing his descent to a place where he could n't breathe . Beeler sat before a new television set , his blue , enigmatic eyes going from an interview program to Norman and then back again , all quite rapidly . " A Chanukah present from my doll baby , " he said in his ragged voice . " I ca n't get over my little Sheryl , going out and getting a expensive set like that . Can you imagine , that little curly-locks ? I should n't count my blessings ? Immaculate , that child . Her mother started her out like that ; it goes into the heart eventual . Driven snow . I 'm not religious , but a man needs a altar , a clean place . You 'll admit this is no castle , but with her , it 's a oasis , a senctuerry .

Nothing  --  buttons . Guy like me never owns nothing . I had a brain , I went to pharmacy school , worked for years in other people 's drugstores . Did n't I see the filth , the crookedness ? Did n't I do myself , selling phenobarbital to hopheads , putting on a fancy label with a Latin name and selling to knocked-up high-school kids  --  castor oil . So tell me , would this be a life without you havep159someplace and someone which is clean and innocent and sweet ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the bald scalp made him look like an aged monk , and yet the stitched seams in his cheeks and around his eyes and mouth were hard and wise : it was as though he were two people , or , rather , one disguised man . But there was no knowing which was the disguise and which was Beeler ; perhapshe himself had no way or desire to know . " Look at her , " Beeler commanded , waving at the old studio photographwhere Sheryl , cast forever as Shirley Temple , smiled sweetly out of time . " Is that a doll baby , is that a doll baby or not ? " And Norman , just in from the outside , breathed timidly , too heavily assessed for horror , too smashed by the weird irony of Beeler 's heedless dream to assert even his own name . And then Sheryl came out in the dragon robe , her face and body almost shaped in Beeler 's image for Norman too . She kissed her father 's shiny pate in passing , her large , coarsely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her full red mouth on the old druggist 's head , she could have been suckingsomething from him or injecting an odd hallucinatory venom into him . Beeler 's face smiled so deeply that you could see without question that his head had been punctured , one way or another . " Daddy , honey , " she said in her smoker 's voice , running her hand along his shoulder as she went toward Norman . Beeler tarnished in the cloudy light . " See , I 've got it all ready for you , " she said slyly , pushing the money into Norman 's hand . Her tweezed eyebrows shone with cold cream , and the lubricated look of her smooth , large-pored skin added unrelated heat to Norman 's ailment . " Save you effort  --  you look tired , sweety . " She walked him to the door , opened it , and fitted it between the heavy swellp160of her breasts , so that the dragon there looked apoplectic . " I been thinking about your offer , you know . How about a week from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls in the office . You could come up around ten thirty , bring a little booze . We could dance to the radio and like that . Hmmm ? " " It 's a date , " Norman said in a normal voice , doing something with his face he hoped was smiling . " I 'll see you then . " " I 'll look forward , " she said , keeping her eyes on him as she closed the door so that he could n't look down at the money in his hand . " And by the way , do n't forget about our john . " Resignedly , he counted the money and was not surprised that it was now ten dollars short . A drop in the bucket of his blood . How many murders can you be hanged for , anyhow ? he thought . It seemed he was at the bottom of his fall and was only writhing around at the same level . Either he would rise up from his abyss or the mercy of a great stone would bury him there ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid him with a check , and he did n't even remindher that checks were no good to him , were worth no more than his receipts . Shame made her speak to another , better Norman over his shoulder , and her immense , lovely eyes had yellowish matter in the inner corners , as though for too long she had been seeing herself in humiliating posturesand was now infected by the ugliness of her real role . Norman promised her something , which bewildered her ; he himself had no idea what it was . Karloff shoved him with surprising strength when Norman told him that the following week he was coming there with water and soap and paint , and was planning purification byp161fire . The ancient 's eyes were glittering with a blue-and-yellow complex ; walking away from Norman after his assault , he moved on petrified limbs and sat down with a movement that hinted he might never get up . " Go , go , vas kenst du tuhn tsu miry ' ' " he asked rhetorically , in a voice like a clatter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two great hands apart . " A hundred years ago I vas spilled all over vit boiling vater , from every inch duh body . Duh old vomans say , He can not Tiff , erh shtaben . ' Dey put me around all over vit mud . I vas cover , around duh aigen , duh mout . . . mine klayna petzel looked it vas a butt fuhn a tsigar like in a ash tray .

But all dub time , all . . . duh . . . time , I 'm breathing , I 'm tasting , I 'm hearing , I 'm knowing ! " He made silence something that could be heard . The length of his consciousness was like that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it made the deepest , most resonant note Norman had ever heard . No daylight came into that room , and Karloff was made of the brass light of a naked bulb ; he was filthy with age , like something dug out of damp ground , the crevices filled with a green cuprous mold , his eyes reflecting things that were no longer there . " You vill clean , vat  --  vat vill you do ? " he said with great and inhuman pity . And the thought of Karloff 's approaching death suddenly filled Norman with dread : he imagined some immense thing crashing to the ground and reducing everything in sight to piteous rubble . A hundred years of knowing ! Of knowing what ? What an ant 's life had Norman Moonbloom led ! Thep162aged presence compressed him . He hoped to be distilled there in the reeking room with the ancient monstrosity peering at him , daring him to tamper with life and death . " Anyhow , I will do it , " Norman said with great courage . Karloff just sat there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a flagellant 's smile . " Rent , rent , rent . I shall never be done paying you , shall I ? " " You 're not paying me , " Norman said in a recorded voice . " I 'm only the agent . You owe me nothing . " " Ah , aha , ahaha . . . " She began to giggle , and her laughter was nerve-racking because her face expressed only hatred ; her skin resembled the inside of a pelt and was reversed only at the cost of great pain . " You . . . you say I owe you nothing , yes , sure . You people , how your mouths say one thing and mean another . " Norman stepped back involuntarily , but she continued to smile , and her hands fluttered down the length of her body , displaying herself . " What can you get from me ? If I have taken the most terrible things in the greatest quantity , taken with my eyes and my ears .. . Oh , all you can get is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you 'll speak plain and tell me what you 're trying to say . I do n't understand what you throw at me every time I come here . " He said it to her blotchy red face , said it sincerely , believing it . And yet somehow he had the feeling that if he turned his eyes just a little , all of what she meant would be quite clear . And this was the sensation he felt all that day , running in and out of the buildings , losing his route , visiting each of the buildings many times , always so fresh from the outdoorsthat the crystals of fine snow were glistening on the mammoth crown and brim of his hat . Each of them existedp163on the edge of unbearable chasms , places that overlooked great and monstrous views . It was as though one tiny adjustmentof his vision would bring it all to him , and he feared the unguessable touch that could bring it about . Dimly , he was aware of trying to check his list of things to be done ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had missed . His expression made the tenants suspect subterfuge ; he seemed suddenly quite strange as he avoided their eyes , his small face crowned with the absurd hat and its tiny brilliants of snow . The tension became mutual . They spoke less than usual to him . Some of them suspected he carried some kind of hope with him , but even those were apprehensive about how he would give it to them . Marvin Schoenbrun thought the agent was going crazy , and he was repelled because a crazy man was worse even than a sane one to him . The Lublins were settling into another chamber of Hell and for the time being imagined Norman 's abstraction would make him merely irrelevant . Sugarman looked at him pityingly and began , subconsciously , to composean ode . Minna and Eva Baily did n't renew their dinner invitation . Del Rio did n't notice one way or another , because he was going mad himself . " I 've got me a date tonight , " he said in a steely voice . " I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some steam . It 's been a long time since I 've bothered with girls , but I 've got to blow off steam , blow off steam .... " He stood , socking the words into his palm , the cords standing out in his neck . The room was so clean it looked cold ; but Del Rio burned . So Norman , at the end of his rope and connected to it at his neck , went out into the dark of millions of cold wet touches , tasting snow and reeling under the invisible fallings.  |p164BUT  THE FOLLOWING day still only moved him sideways in his pit . He went into the Seventieth Street lobby , catching a quick glimpse of a graying Mussulman in a huge pallid hat in the mirror . Going up in the elevator , he tried to pick the color of paint he should use to efface the rusted pornography . Only semiconsciously , at first , did he sense an approaching noise . Voices  --  more particularly , one voice . Screaming . But there were other voices too , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too precisely spaced to be quite convincing . Norman shuddered as the elevator reached the top floor , and he almost pushed the button to go back down again . Was it only curiosity that made him open the door and step into the sound ? " What 's happened ? " he asked Eva Baily , who stood with Betty Jacoby and Sidone at the door to the Hausers ' apartment . The screaming came from inside , harsh , obligatory , and inhuman . Eva was crying and shaking her head . There were more voices inside , and between the screams Norman thought he recognized Sarah Lublin 's voice and even the drowsy monotoneof Jane Sprague . He smelled the scent of clinics . " What is it ? Is someone hurt ? An accident ? " he asked . Sidone pointed inside and shook his head , bewildered looking without his sunglasses , his long , oily hair chaotic from bed . A man in a white jacket came out and went to the elevator , calling back to someone , " I 'll go down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's insides . He became angry at his ignorance and seized Sidone 's arm , noticing briefly his own surprise at the arm 's thinness . " For God 's sake , " he pleaded . " The kid , " Sidone said . " It 's the kid . " Still holding Sidone 's arm , Norman looked toward the half-opened door , suddenly aware of the rapid increase of his old sensation of stretching . All he could see was the little entry and a sliver of the living room . The movement he recognized as the lamp-shade river . Someone crossed the thin rectangle too quickly to be recognized . Another figure , in a white jacket and white pants , stood with its back to Norman , blocking off the lamp . " Did you give the father something ? " someone said . " Both of them , " another strange voice answered . " Bobby , Bahh-beee , " an unrecognizable voice wailed . " There , there , " Sarah Lublin said from somewhere out of sight . The screaming went on uninterruptedly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . something he swallowed , " Betty Jacoby said from beside him . " Ohhh , yess , " Norman breathed , letting go of Sidone 's arm . He stood joined to them in the hallway , making a foursome  --  not of grief , but , oddly , of commemoration . The moment was significant ; it deserved formality . There came the sound of something crashing , a confused murmuring , and then Jane Sprague 's voice saying , " No , no , it 's my fault , I 'll clean it up . I 'm sorry . " The elevator door opened again , and the man in the white jacket returned , carrying a collapsed stretcher . He went inside , turned to look back questioningly at them , and , when they made no move to enter , closed the door in their faces.  |p166With  the door closed , the screams became more hollow and resonant , the other voices muffled and mysterious . " But how ? " Norman asked , looking from one to another of them . Eva shrugged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Norman whispered . Eva looked at him with an expression of some revulsion . In the hallway , in the entire building , the silence compressedthe din inside the apartment , made it sound immenselyimportant . Norman sweated rivers and groped with his eyes for the injuries to the hallway . Part of him knew that the gigantic city pulsed and moved in its intricate life quite oblivious to the one smothered cell , and yet to him death had appeared for the very first time . The deaths of his family were merely burst daydreams in retrospect . He had lived most of his life in a deep-shadowed glen and had come out into an open ravine where towers of rock rose up all around him , where things falling made great destruction . The screaming was metronomic , the four of them just small pillars in the hard hallway . He discovered several huge cracks in the stucco wall , a missing bulb , a cavity where a tile had been . Betty Jacoby grunted and leaned against the wall . Sidone said , " What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point to . . . " And then lapsed into silence . The elevator door opened again , and two men wheeled some kind of machine to the door and opened it . One of the white-clad men appeared and said , " No , forget it ; there 's no use . " The two men wheeled the apparatus back to the elevator and went down . When the elevator came up again , a white-haired man with skin like a worn rug hurried past them and went inside . There was a crescendo of crying whichp167quickly settled down . A policeman came up the stairs and went into the apartment . Betty Jacoby shook her head and said , " I must lie down . Call me if . . . " Then she went down the hall , holding on to the wall . Sidone said , " Well , Katz is inside , " as though that explained his staying . Finally there came a long , high scream that broke something in Norman , a sound of struggle , and then no more screaming . The door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , no , no , no , no . " Two white-clad men carried the stretcher out ; the blanketed form was too small to take seriously . Norman hurried ahead of the stretcher-bearers and opened the elevator door . He got in behind them and pressed L. The motor whined and dropped them slowly . He stood , half consciously shielding the dirty drawings from the stretcher . One of the men adjusted a corner of the blanket . The whining of the elevator had a peaceful sound , but the lump of the hidden child entered Norman 's stomach or heart or soul . As they bumped to a stop , he unthinkingly tore off the " Did Not Pass Inspection " sign and opened the door for the stretcherbearers . They passed out of the elevator and through the lobby ; Norman looked after them from inside the elevator until they were out of sight . When he heard the ambulance motor start , he closed the door and went back up . The policeman and another man came out ; through the opened door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river was gone . That was what had broken , he thought . The funeral was oddly disappointing . Norman , expecting unbearable demonstration , was presented only with lifelessness . The child , in a white open coffin , gave him the nastyp168floating feeling of a nightmare . The parents were thy . Carol 's hair was drawn back in an institutional bun and showed the dark roots . Her face was boggy and gray-white , and the only resemblance to what she had looked like was in the shape of her mouth and her nose . The brightly painted woman had been the decoration on a mummy case ; now the case was opened to reveal the livid remains . A life of divorcement from real feeling had wasted her . She stood over the coffin for some time , her handkerchief against her mouth , as though only her mouth could cry . Sherman stood beside her , much more well groomed . Together they were mute and hideous , not like mourners , but like creatures numbed into animal pain by flaming clothes . Their eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed the intense bewildermentof people who are told they have been robbed of all their belongings but who are uncertain exactly what they had owned . Norman looked along the row of mourners , all of whom were tenants . He realized that they knew no more about what they felt than he did , and he contrasted that with the time of his grandmother 's funeral , when he had felt excludedfrom the shared feelings . A minister recited Biblical words ; an old man cried quietly . Katz , two seats down , stared his eyes out at the now closed coffin , trying to open it by the force of his will . He licked his squashed , trumpeter 's mouth ; a tear ran down his plump cheek like the slimy track of a snail . He seemed to be muttering something , his lips working . His fingers made rigid arches on his thighs . Beyond him , Sarah and Aaron Lublin sat without expression , much more used to the scene ( Hirsch freed them for the occasion by sitting with their children ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Marvin Schoenbrun and saw his clean , perfect fingers in repose on his flanneled leg . Aroundp169them all the beige walls of the chapel rose up to a white ceiling . Little scrolled fixtures held candle-shaped bulbs , and the entire room had a nonsectarian quality that gave the ceremony an official feeling , like something performed by and for civil servants . At the end of the row he glimpsed Betty Jacoby , dressed in black and with a heavy veil over her face ; Arnold was framed against her dress , slumped in his seat and gazing petulantly at the ceiling . An " Amen " made the audience shift in their seats . The minister invitedthose who so desired to come to the cemetery . A huddleof strangers , family of the bereaved , formed a clot and moved through a side door to the sound of an animal grunting  --  Shermanor Carol . Norman could n't tell which . Barely able to see , he rushed out , aiming himself toward his office with body and soul.  |p170ALL  WEEK HE spent his evenings in the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it seemed the only way to chart his personal latitude and longitude . Suddenly lost in a forest of lives , he yearned for a tabulator , longed for it as a mariner , adrift in a night without stars , might long for a sextant . By Saturday night , however , he had made a makeshift instrument from a week of plumber and electricianestimates . He sat in bad light , picking bits of a bad supper from his teeth with a toothpick and staring at the black shine of the night-backed window . " Moonbloom " had become " Moonbloon " and a leg of the remaining n was chipping away , would soon become  --  what ? " Moonbloor " ? Above , his brother 's name was , stolidly , permanently , still " MOONBLOOM . " He sensed people passing , occasionally saw the mirror-like windowbriefly transparent in the light of a passing car . Mostly , though , there was just the image of himself , cadaverous in the overhead light , a sort of grotesque portrait of an executive , based by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people lived over his office too . And what were they like ? Could they all be as horrible and dangerous as his own tenants ? For a moment he shivered at the thought of the infinitely long list of complaints of all the millions . Good God , he thought , what would the advancement that Irwin had once promised entail for him ? Longer lists , morep171complicated charts of tormenting complexity ? It occurred to him that he really did n't want the " opportunity " Irwin had promised ( or threatened ? ) . Why , then , was he laboring so mightily to do something ? Because he now seemed to have no choice , because he was not like that mariner setting out from a port , but , rather , one adrift in an empty ocean , his movement no longer dictated by ambition , but by a need to survive . Somehow he had been cast into the inferno of people ; at this point it did n't matter whose hand had done the casting . Pipes ran , a hissing came from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He scanned the spreadoutpapers covered with figures and notations and telephone numbers . On a clean sheet he accumulated what seemed to be the facts . The total cost for what he considered to be the minimal repairs came to five thousand three hundred and eightysevendollars and twenty-two cents ; the owed rent , counting what Sheryl Beeler had cheated him out of , came to a hundred and seventy-three fifty . Irwin expected , on or about the first of the year , a total of seven weeks ' rental , roughly thirty-five hundred , out of which he would deposit some five hundred for maintenance . This meant that Norman would be in the red for approximately .. . He began to laugh , caught himself , and shivered the mirth to a stop . He picked up the pen and tried all over again , conscious that he was floating in a stream of lunacy , yet unable to stop paddling . And was he including what needed to be repaired in the tenants ? Suppose he made a list of those things too , tried to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars for the Hausers for new hearts ; six hundred and fifty for Kram 's new body ; eight hundred and twenty dollars and sixty-six cents for refurbish/ing Basellecci 's dignity ; a thousand for a new dignity for Leni Cass ; nine hundred for a retread of Ilse 's soul ; five thousand for a brand-new one for Katz ( souls must come high ) . . . He began to laugh again , but stopped , chilled , when it turned to screaming . He looked around wildly , ready for collapse . Then he remembered that he had a date with Sheryl Beeler for that evening , and numbed with amazement , he was able to collect himself , even to the towering fedora , and he got up , put his coat on with mechanical motions , and went to his rendezvous . He knocked softly at the door and was almost bowled over by its sudden opening . Sheryl stood before him in low-cut splendor , as bright as a poster in a red dress and gleaming lipstick and a silvered jewelry sword pointing toward her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just this minute got in . Come on in and make yourself at home . " She smelled powerfully of some unnaturally sweet flower , and Norman , partly dazed , partly incredulous , came blinking out of the dark hallway . " Lemme just slip into something more comfy , " she said . Norman could n't believe that she had actually said that , and he slumped onto the couch and stared at the depressionin Beeler 's empty chair . He heard the water running in the bathroom , the feeble sound of the faulty toilet flushing , and , from another room , the sound of snoring , very loud and emphatic . He wondered whether , at this late date , he might lose his virginity ; the thought did n't excite him , because there seemed to be nothing that was real about his presence there . Sheryl came back in the dragon kimono and swished by him to the television set . Hypnotized , he looked past her broad , silken back to watch the small square burst open intop173a scene of a smily band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spilling of hot fudge on hollow metal pans . " Music to dance to , " Sheryl said , holding her arms out in invitation . Beyond fear , Norman went to her , grasped the warm resiliency of her torso , and began earnestly to do the two-step . For a few minutes he was able to concentrate on the unfamiliarfact of his dancing . He looked down past his arm to the imitation Persian rug , guiding himself in the pattern that made an invisible checkerboard of the floor . One , two , slide , then sideways , one , two , slide . The music oozed over him as he navigated the boxes . Dancing , and this step so appropriate for him , his dance of life . Beeler snored , the toilet tank drained feebly . One , two , slide , one , two , slide . They passed the lamp , and Sheryl deftly switched it off without breaking the rigid form of his dance . One , two , slide . He could barely see the floor , which was now lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One , two , slide , one , two , slide . There was a warm trembling against his body as Sheryl laughed silently . One , two , slide , he emphasized , the roots of his hair planted in sweat , so that his head felt like a rice paddy . One , two , slide . Her large breasts made big blunt concavities in him . One , two , slide , one , two , slide . Belly , thighs , the jut of her buttocks just below his hand like a cliff edge . One , two , slide . He was making square holes in the floor and expected momentarily to fall through one of them . One , two , slide , one , two . . . Something was reaching out of him for the warmth . He danced bent over , his body held away at the middle , his head resting in the hollow of her neck . She began to giggle softly and move after his escaping groin . He bent over more and more , and her giggle grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candy violins of the orchestra rose in sappy crescendo . Suddenly his back reached an extremity of discomfort , and reflexively hep174snapped erect , plunging like a rivet into Sheryl 's kimonoed loins . " Ohhh-hh , " he gasped fearfully . " Ahhh-hh , " she responded cheerfully . " I did n't mean . . . " Sheryl , lovely in the blue-white television light , chucked him under the chin and said , " Let 's sit on the couch , hon. " She took his hand and led him there , grinning at his stiff , aching walk . They sat down , and she leaned away from him , studying his face with amusement . The dragon seemed to wink in the wavering light , and Norman addressed his apology to it . " I hope you do n't think . . . that is , I do n't know what happened to me , I mean , I know , but I do n't know why . No , of course , I know why , but I really was n't thinking of . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the blood seemed to rush into . . . What I mean is , sometimes when a man gets close to a ... girl , there 's a nervous response that forces the blood into his . .. " " Why , honey , all that happened was you got a hard on . " Norman smiled feebly , hearing the crackle of fire consuminghim . From his stomach to his knees a cooking process rolled his organs around , and the steam reddened his face . " Sheryl , " he said weakly . Sheryl came close , her face blurring . He felt her lips fasten hotly on his . With a moan he tried to climb her , his hands clutching air . " Easy , easy , bon , " she said with soft laughter . " Here , there , ahh , yeah , sweety , yeah . . . " His gratitude knew no bounds when her warm , naked breasts fell into his hands . " I love you , I love you , " he groaned . He was tossed like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheryl , Sheryl , Sheryl , " he cried through his teeth . " I love ... "  | " The toilet , " she whispered from below , holding him up in the air like a child . He nodded wildly . " And a rent cut ? " He tossed his head , trying to shake it loose from his body , and her demands did nothing to reduce his feelings . Distended , breaking , he agreed to carte blanche . For a long moment he observed and passed through many things . Sheryl 's face expressed profound affection and bliss ; he knew an instant 's mortification as he noticed the band leader 's face sweetly smiling at them ; he worried about her father , whose snoring began to caricature itself ; and , finally , he felt himself on an eminence he had never achieved before and he looked out with wonder upon the vast valley of the world , dizzied by the height , astounded by the immensity of the view . Sheryl raised him higher , her arms extended full length , her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunged him down , hara-kari fashion , immolating herself with a great sigh . There was a splat of impact , Norman rolled his eyes back into his head , held on to unimaginable pleasure for a short while , rearing and bucking to the tune of the string section playing " Bei Mir Bist Du Schoen , " and then exploded frighteningly . He never noticed when Sheryl removed his body from her but only lay for some time muttering into the dusty cushions , " I love , love , love .... " Strengthless , his skin charged with sensitivity , he felt the warm flickers of the television light over his buttocks . The bathroom sounded busy with water and movement . He heard footsteps on the ceiling . Something profound had changed in him , and he sought to recognize it . Like a dusty bug , the image of a small man in a large hat walked across his brain , and he felt deep pity for the figure . He felt no peace , though , but , rather , a great shapeless ambition that saddened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he really could do with the impossiblep176situation . Something began to occur to him , and he cupped it , patiently gave it time to mature . But there was no more snoring ! He sat up quickly and drew his pants on , stepped into his shoes barefooted , and slipped on his shirt . When he was all dressed , he shoved his underpants into one pocket , his socks into another . " Okay ? " Sheryl asked , coming back into the room . " I ca n't begin . . . " " Gim me a kiss and then go home , huh ? " she said , sleepily . " I 'm just bushed . " He kissed her tenderly and was n't in the least disillusioned when she said at the door , " Now do n't forget what you prom-ised . " " " I 'll never forget , " Norman said with a strange lilting note in his voice . And then he went out , heading for his office with the wind cold on his sockless ankles , feeling reckless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loins free of underwear . And the thing that had occurred to him as he lay exhausted on Sheryl 's couch , now , in the clear dark , formed unmistakably . He would do all the work himself , he decided , his face seeming to sparkle , as at the idea of a holy war . But , what was more important , he would do it with laughter , for it occurred to him that joy resembled mourning and was , if anything , just as powerful and profound . He was not upset , or surprised either , to recognize the presence of pain in him as the tenants filed through his mind , stepping brutally on the tender places in his heart . He thought of the dead child , the trampled dignity of Basellecci , the constanthell of the Lublins , the erupting of Del Rio , the desperatedefiance of Karloff , and all the rest of them in their agonies ; and where he had the choice of crying , he chose irrevocably its opposite . He laughed loudly in a tone Normanp177Moonbloom would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in his life , he sang aloud without shame . A sophisticated policeman just studied him wearily as he sang out of tune , " Bei mir bist du schoen , again I 'll explain . .. " P178IN HIS APARTMENT he took sensual pleasure in writing a new itemized list , setting down words of things he could anticipate using , things he himself could touch and smell . His own expert , he estimated grandly , and knew the delight of his own generosity for the very first time . " Paint , " he wrote , " fifty gallons  --  white , ten gallons  --  various colors . Brushes  --  two of each size . Turpentine  --  ten gallons . Linseedoil  --  twelve gallons . Plaster  --  two hundred pounds . . . " And could n't he just smell the sharp tang of the new paint , the wet , cereal-like odor of the plaster ? The sound of the city was a great , cavelike murmuring , filled with the wing beats of motors , the little , distant bleats of horns and cries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home . He wondered how they sold wire . His refrigerator made a steady , glassy vibration ; the streets outside took long asthmatic breaths , never exhaling . He wrote : " Trowels or plastering knives or whatever they call them . Stuff for the tiles . Pipe ( ask Bodien ) . Other tools ( check with Gaylord ) . " The wind shook his windows , from another apartment he heard a Christmas carol on the radio . He was , at that moment , teetering on the unreal , and when he was unbalanced he did n't really know which way he fell . He hardly noticed the sound of someone coming up the steps , but knocked over his chair at the crashing of a hand against his door.  | " Who ? " he cried . He swallowed . " Who is it ? " " Moonbloom , Moonbloom , " a voice wailed . " You got ta . . . " Norman went to the door , trying to balance on the thin sense of joy ; he was frightened , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death . " Who is it ? " he demanded , opening the door a crack , with the chain still on . The reek of alcohol made him grimace , and dimly he made out a mad face that was somewhat familiar . " Del Rio ? " " Please , come on , Moonbloom , help me , " Del Rio said in a harsh undertone that made him sound gutted . Norman let him in . Del Rio walked into the light blinking , contorting his mouth . Norman gasped at his filth ; there were his features , his Greek athlete 's body , but his jacket sleeve was ripped at the shoulder seam , and the jacket was crumpled , filthy . Worst of all were his padded , fighter 's eyes ; they peered out from under the scarred folds with an expression Norman remembered seeing in the eyes of a rudely awakened sleepwalker . Del Rio was awake now , and it was unbearable to him to have his dream authenticated . " What happened to you ? What are you doing here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Del Rio 's place . " Look , look , " Del Rio said , holding one hand out to Norman ; unintentionally , his face expressed threat . " You know how I am , you know . What did I want ? Was it terrible ? I wish for things . . . me , to be clean , clean . You saw how I kept myself , how I lived . " Norman sat down with some permanence now , staring open-mouthed at two parallel scratches on Del Rio 's neck . The black hair was wild as a burred mane and could have been carrying some frightful rubbish in its tangles . He sat in his formerly peaceful room and wondered anew at the presentationshe was being offered with increasing frequency.  | " See , because I know about how they live in dirt , I know damn well . " Del Rio began walking back and forth , tossing his hands about , jerking his head awkwardly , as though all the fine mobility of his muscles had deserted him . " We lived six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My grandmother stank from disease . We saw my mother and father screwing , and when he was only nine and my sister was ten , my brother did it to my sister . And they smelled , on both sides of me they smelled . On a summer night , like he was my father 's shadow , there 'd be Ramon going up and down on my sister while the old man was on my mother . And the old woman and me were the only ones without anything to do , and sometimes we 'd look at each other in the dark , and I 'd see her eyes gleaming . Like she was laughing . And voices and radios all around , in the other rooms , and the smell of garbage , and of them . I got to be thirteen and I start going to the gym , I start keeping myself cleaner than anyone who ever lived . I slept in the gym when I could . I took showers twice a day . It made me happy to live like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter , and my body got strong and my mind got strong . When I had to sleep there , at home , I put myself like in a trance , rigid  --  I made myself go to sleep . After a while Ramon went away someplace , I never saw him any more . But my sister would still be there , and I 'd lay stiff as a board , not looking at her , not hearing her . She used to whisper to me . . . I went in this trance . I improvedmy mind . You saw , I study acting , I trained , I kept myself . . . " And suddenly he was crying , his fists in his eyes . " You saw . . . them bastards with their roaches and their shit . How I cleaned that place , how I . . . " " What happened ? " Norman asked , feeling a queer elation from his own aching body . Laughter swam beneath his great expanse of pity , blurred but visible , like a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awesome privilege , he felt , and he knew better than to answer it with despair . " I went out with this girl . We drank liquor . . . . I do n't know what happened . We got to my room . I got excited , crazy . I tore off her clothes . I do n't know what I was . . . She got all hot too . . . . It was all mixed up . She began to whisper to me . . . . And I 'm a virgin . I do n't know , I do n't know . . . . I began to beat her up . I left her . Maybe she 's dead . I 'm all , all . . . " Norman began to laugh with sad eyes , uncontrollably . Del Rio looked up at him , dazed , disbelieving , then believing , understanding that now there was no up or down any more . He sat with his head down , accepting Norman 's laughter , totally unable to feel indignation or hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his laughter . Standing over the seated fighter , he knew that much of his laughter came from a sensation of pure funniness  --  that he and Del Rio should have been deflowered on the same night was a thing of fabulous humor . True , what had prepared them for the ridiculously tardy initiation was as different as could be  --  the one being a lifetime of desperate and epic courage , the other , his own , a long sleep . But the tragic quality of Del Rio 's experience seemed only to lend a depth , a resonance to Norman 's laughter . Weeping and laughter both expressed the irresistible , and pain and joy interchanged between them . How had he chosen laughter ? he wondered , shaking with it and dabbing at his eye with one knuckle while with the other hand he made a mute offering to the wrecked man , who could n't see his hand . He could only guess at some instinct for survival , or some hereditary tendency to pray in a dance of joy . When he stopped laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weakly he sat down beside Del Rio and putp182his hand on the muscular arm . " I was n't making fun , Del Rio . I ca n't really explain ; it would sound too silly to you . Of course this is all terrible . You 've had an awful life  --  you wo n't believe how much I feel it . What can I do for you ? Shall we go to your room and see how the girl is ? Come on , I 'm sure you did n't kill her , I 'm sure you could n't have . " " You do n't know . I feel like . . . like hell . All the rotten things . Did n't I try ? What could I have done ? Is a guy supposedto have a life like that ? What kind of shit is all this ? Tell me that , will you ? Is it just a big shit pile , with everybodyrotten and smelly ? And me too , me too . . . " He looked at his big hands with loathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had despised others as he had . Where was he without that carefully carved superiority ? Bloodied , soiled , incubated in ugliness , he had imagined strength could deliverhim . In his anguish he sighed with relief . " Now what ? Tell me that . What am I supposed to do now ? " " I do n't know what . . . what kind of . . . shit ' this is , Del Rio , " Norman answered , staring hard at the pale , oilcoloredskin . " It 's all new to me . I never was involved in things like this . I could n't describe to you how I lived . Look at how I look , can you see ? I saw myself in a mirror today and I thought it was someone else . I bet I 'm down to one fifteen . My body hurts me , I 'm tired , almost sick it seems . And yet , yet I feel like I could do great things now . What ? I do n't know . It 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , less than that even , I would have worried about the way I 'm feeling , the way I want to . . . do something , the way I feel like laughing even though I get very sad and upset . SometimesI tell myself that I 'm heading for a breakdown , but mostly , these last few weeks , I have the sensation that life is just opening up for me . I 'm considering hope , although Ip183realize I might end up in a terrible state . Why did I laugh ? Oh , just one thing in particular , a coincidence  --  there 's no sense going into it . " He allowed a minute for his raving to have some remote chance of getting to Del Rio . Then he tapped him vigorously on the arm . " Come on , let 's see where you stand . I feel like I can do things for you . Let 's go to your room . Then we 'll see . " Del Rio , who had never asked for help before , now looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said scornfully , stirring in the chair , still dangerous both to himself and to others . " I 'm sorry I came here . You 're a nut , you know that ? I ought to let you have it too . Now that I 'm started , I ought to let everyone have it . " He stood up and made fists at his sides , breathing heavily through his mouth , his eyes glazed against the total darkness revealed to him . And looking at him , Norman grew frightened . Right then it was not so much physical injury he feared as the ghastly things that powered Del Rio . The tendons in Del Rio 's neck stood out , his eyes narrowed , he began to rock slightly . Norman became fascinated by the barely moving fists , which looked like great cured-leather clubs . He tried to prepare himself for the sensation of splintered bone and cartilage . Del Rio hunched himself , hissed slightly . Norman yearned for his murky plans . Del Rio stepped forward , and Norman closed his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Normanbegan to disengage his vague hopes . He heard the floor creak in front of him , heard the tremendous yet quiet voice of the city , with its feel of such gigantic weight that you lived in expectation of the earth 's giving way beneath it . He opened his eyes to see Del Rio weeping again , his hands harmless . Norman smiled  | " Ah , you are hopeless , " he said with both mockery and tenderness . " Let 's go now . You 'll just have to leave it up to me . Del Rio agreed by silence , and they went out together to ascertain his crime . Norman came home very late and he was chuckling , filled with the strange and melancholy mirth that had first visited him early that evening . Now it was three o'clock in the morning . He fumbled secretively with the keys , unlocked the door , and tiptoed into the apartment like a drunk hiding his glee from a sleeping wife . For a few minutes he stood facing the glum light of the window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sight of the enraged girl , with her two black eyes , the policemen standing nervously in Del Rio 's room , tensed for violence and unbalanced by the fighter 's mute submission . And his own farewell to Del Rio before the police had taken him out to their car : " It was like pus from a wound , Del Rio  --  better out than in . I 'll save a room for you , and you 'll be surprised how clean the place will be . " And of course he had had to shout above the screaming of the furious girl , so that he could n't be sure that Del Rio had heard all of it . The policemen had seemed to consider taking Norman along when they heard what he said and saw how he said it . But then they had gone , and the house had become so quiet that he could hear Paxton 's typewriter from the floor above , and even dimly , from two floors up , Louie 's tiny televisionset playing some silly music that was distilled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking , " Look at me , see what I 'm in . I never dreamed there was this . " Without turning the lights on , he walked into the bedroom and , in the dim light from the window , he studied thep185small skull of a man floating in the black water of the glass . This should have all happened to a bigger man , he thought , a monumental character . It will kill me . Then he smiled and made a creamy strip in the blackish-green image of the head . And the laughter trembled inside him , causing an increase in the pain , which in turn boiled the laughter more rapidly , which increased the pain , and so on . That child , he thought , laughing silently before the mirror , how terrible . And the Lublins and Basellecci and . . . His laughter was not because they were all funny ; it was only slightly because of anything 's funniness . Rather , as he stood there , fantastically weary , it was an expression of profound modesty and wonder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ashy light , " all this for me ? "  |p186HE  WAS AT his office by eight o'clock , fully awake after some three hours ' sleep and scornful of those drugged risers who had slept deeply for eight or more hours . If his limbs felt somewhat alien and fragile , it was a small price to pay for the wonderful ringing clarity of his brain . A child , hanging on the iron rail up on the sidewalk , stared down at him in open-mouthed curiosity . Norman waved without interrupting his furious house cleaning . He threw away papers by the armload . The dust flew ; to the child , Norman was like an unusual engine warming up amid clouds of smoke . In a half-hour the place had the stripped-down aspectof a warship 's bridge . Norman surveyed it with a savage smile , and the filing cabinet seemed to hunch up against the wall , intimidated . He gave a short bark of laughter and sat down by the phone . First he called the elevator people and demanded in Irwin 's voice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man for January seventh , " the man said dryly . " We 're booked up till then . " " I said this week , " Norman-Irwin replied with a sharp quietness of command . " Hey , buddy  --  you 're only one small job . You do n't give orders like that , " the man said , nevertheless slightly uneasy under the brassy voice Norman affected . " First come , first served . "  | " One small job ? " Norman said incredulously , feeling himselffalling into the part ; Del Rio would have been awed by his ability to project . " I guess you did n't hear me . I said this was Moonbloom Realty . " " Moonbloom ? " the man said in genuine ignorance . " You 've heard of Uris , Zeckendorf , Levitt ? " " Yeah , I heard of them . " " Well , put them all together and you have Moonbloom . You 're lucky I 'm even taking the time to reason with you . Do you know that my time is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like to throw my weight around , but we rannana rannana rannana . I 'd hate to rannana rannana rannana . When he hung up in the middle of the man 's fervent promise to have ser , 1ice by the middle of the week , Normanlost his breath in laughter . He stopped only when he felt a pain in his chest ; then , with a deep breath , he collectedhimself and dialed Irwin 's number . " I just wanted to explain why the check I 'm sending you is a little smaller than you probably expected , Irwin . " There was a sputter of words from Irwin , and he waited patiently to go on . " Four tenants moved out because the apartments they lived in became uninhabitable . I 'm working on repairing them . " Norman's-voice had the tiredly patient sound of a father . " This is getting utterly impossible , Norman , " Irwin said , the indignation making his voice go up like xylophone notes . " I do n't know what 's come over you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I used to look at you every so often and I 'd say , ' My brother is one guy you can depend on . ' Are you getting deranged , or what ? "  | " What did I say that 's got you so upset ? " Norman asked , enjoying fraud as though it were an unaccustomed liquor . " I 've heard every kind of excuse from the rotten agents I 've had , but yours beats them all . " " Irwin ? " he said politely . " Well , for Christ 's sake , telling me the goddamn buildings are shrinking ! " For some reason the silence was like the sound of a voice stuck on the letter " Y. " " Norman ? " " YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY ... " " Are you there ? " " Yes , Irwin . " " Well , what do you have to say ? " " Only that some things are beyond explanation . " " That 's no answer . " " Perhaps , Irwin . . . perhaps buildings can shrink . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All I know is that if I was n't up to my neck with some tax people right now , I 'd come over there and straighten this out , one way or another . " " Please do n't worry , Irwin . Everything is going to be won-derful . " " I do n't want to hear anything . Just you hear me  --  that next check better be here in two weeks . And by God , it better show me that those buildings have grown back to normal size . " " Rest assured , Irwin . " " Do n't talk , do n't say a thing . I ca n't stand to hear your voice . Just do , do ! " " I 'll do , " he promised with a diabolic smile that would have maddened Irwin completely . " You . . . " And Irwin hung up , leaving Norman with the phone in his hand like a dumbbell he was having difficulty lifting . Finally he placed it in its cradle and caressed itp189dreamily for a few minutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number . " H'lo , " a child 's voice answered . " Is this Knight ? " " Nosir , " the child replied . " Is this Henderson six , oh five eight seven ? " " Yessir . " " Is n't this Knight then ? " There was a long pause . Finally he heard the breath in the phone again . " This here mornin ' . " " What 's your name , sonny ? " " Hamer . " " Harner what ? " " Harner sir . " " Your last name , Harner ? " " Knight . " Norman sighed delicately . " Is your father there ? " There came the sound of whispering . " Who speakin ' please ? " " Moonbloom , " Norman said impatiently . A whisper again and then , " He not here . " " You tell him to get to this phone or I 'll fire him . " The whispering , then " Oh my gooness , he just now come in , " Harner said woodenly . " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in Norman 's ear it sounded like a power saw . " Now , Gaylord , I want you to stand by . All leaves canceled , " he said , feeling the presence of jehad . He was small as Bonaparte , but knew the importance was not himself ; rather , perhaps , he was Marshal Ney , animated by obedianceto the spirit of his impulse . This was the great campaign  --  what happened afterward was Irwin 's problem . Let Irwin throw all the tenants out afterward ; the fulfillment was in the immediate future . Later was as irrelevant to now as thep190Hereafter was to life . And he was alive , burned down fine , responsive , passionate . " This afternoon I 'll meet you at Karloff'sroom . We are going to wash and paint and burn filth . " " What do you mean ? " " And tomorrow we paint the Lublins ' . " " What , what is all that ? " " We 're going to work , Gaylord , " he said , almost singing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my God , " Gaylord moaned . " Oh my God almighty . "  |p191THEY  RENTED A pickup truck and loaded all the paint and plaster into it , together with brand-new pails and scrub brushes and mops . " I got pails already , " Gaylord moaned , depressed by the extravagance . " No , no , we need new , " Norman insisted . " The best . " Gaylord scowled as he drove toward Thirteenth Street . " I do n't know what got into you , " he said . " What you trying to make out of my life . Them junky buildings , all them nutty people . What they care for paint and all ? You act like you gone crazy , all of a sudden painting and cleaning . This job was only tolerable because I could take it a little easy , do things slow . Pay so lousy I work as a night elevator man three days a week to keep the wolf away . Forty-dollar-a-week man ai n't suppose to kill himself like a laborer . What the devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Uh huh , " Norman said smilingly , " for me . " Gaylord snarled and drove brutally , jerking to stops , turning corners so acutely that Norman crashed against the door or into him . The pails rattled in the back , cans of paint fell over  --  they were like a mobile earthquake going someplace to happen . When they got out at Thirteenth Street , Norman paused a while to study the truck while Gaylord stood sullenly against the fender , his arms crossed , his eyes blankly on the squeezed building . " I kind of feel we ought to paint something on the sides ofp192the truck , " Norman said , his frivolity like that of an aged widower out in the world for the first time , hectic with freedom . " Ai n't our truck , " Gaylord reminded him . " They 'd charge you for defacing . " " Something like Moonbloom Renovating , ' or Renewers Inc : How 's your lettering , Gaylord ? " " Goddamn it , Moonbloom , you got me all set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sultan or something ? I draw the line someplace . You push me too far , I just walk off right now , leave you and this truck full of stuff . You ca n't drive neither . Do n't crowd me now . " Norman smiled wistfully , shrugged , and then went to the back of the truck . " Okay , " he said , " let 's go . " A bum stood watching them carrying their equipment into the hallway , his veinous eyes bulging with curiosity . Gaylord moved doggedly , but Norman was full of the enthusiasm of the neophyte , taking the steps two at a time , overloading himself dangerously , gasping on the edge of laughter . " Wha ' yuh gon na do , tear down tha ' buildin ' ? " the bum croaked . " That 's up to the building , " Norman shouted back , giving the effect of a whole crew . Gaylord grunted derisively . Norman knocked on Karloff 's door . " VAS ? " Karloff roared . " Just Moonbloom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; mine legs are sore . So come already . " Norman opened the door and felt a thrill of dismay at the sight of the room with its centerpiece of Karloff . The murky depth of the walls and the sense of rounded corners where the filth seemed to destroy all geometry faced him , together with the old man , as something appallingly large ; his own presumption excited him almost unbearably.
