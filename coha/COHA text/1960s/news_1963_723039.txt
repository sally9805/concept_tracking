txt Letters to The Times pg . 15 Letters to The Times Our Role in Vietnam ? Bertrand RusselPti Attack on U. S. Policy Discussed To THE EDITOR OF THE Nair YORK TIMES : Bertrand Russell 's letter , published ' April ' 8 , making ? the worse appear the better thing in , Vietnam , is an affront to both mind and heart . I served on the International Control Commission for Vietnam , for one period as acting - head of the Canadian delegation . I have lived in both Communist North Vietnam and the free South . I am acquainted with President Ngo Dinh Diem and with the Communist leader , Ho Chi Minh , and I have had to , study the record of the activities of both Communists and Nationalists in Vietnam in a judicial and judicious frame of mind . It may be granted , at the very least , that I ought to be in a better position than Bertrand Russell to assess the rights and wrongs of what is happening in Vietnam . ( Nor am I an American nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my unequivocal opinion that the people of Vietnam do not wish to be governed by the Communists , that the fighting going on in South Vietnam constitutes an invasion by the North of the South in defiance of the Geneva Accords , and that if the Vietnamese people had to choose between being dominated by Russia , China or the United States , they would choose the United States . In the course of a life not unacquainted with tragedy , among the saddest words I have ever heard were those spoken by a young man in North Vietnam who deplored his brave boyhood during which he had been used by the Communists to plant bombs and hand grenades among the French , whom he wished back in place of his present cruel Communist masters . I have no doubt the wrong-headedness of a Bertrand Russell , who was as wrong-headed when he advocated preventive war against Russia in years gone by , gives the Communists more help than all the tanks and military formations which were used to suppress the Hungarian revolt . THEODORE BLOCKLEY ( former Canadian diplomat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 9 , 1963 . No Support by Vietnamese To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your April 8 editorial taking Bertrand Russell to task for his sharp attack on the United States " for conducting a war of annihilation in Vietnam , " says in part : " . . But to call the United States an aggressor and to say nothing about the Communist push for domination against the will of the inhabitants in Vietnam . . . . " Would you be kind enough to tell me what information you have about the " will of the inhabitants of Vietnam " ? If the will of the inhabitants is in , line with our policy in Vietnam , would you be good enough to explain why some 200,000 soldiers of Diem and our own military forces ca n't overcome the pitiful force of some 20,000 Vietcongs ? Some day you will be forced to eat your words , as were the French . ABE WEISBURD . New York , April 8 , 1963 . To Thwart Communism To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to Lord Russell 's attack . It may be to the single issue of far-off Vietnam  --  who knows ? Lord Russell 's criticism of capitalism should be answered and can be . The answer must show that not all capitalists are blinded by greed , that many have already seen the light , the necessity of helping retarded countries  --  those in South America , for example  --  to attain advancing national economies . The greatest menace to the system is the shortsightedness of those who will not favor any reduction of the differential between the standards of living in the leading capitalist countries and the much inferior standards in-the areas of the world which are too much still the victims of exploitation . Capitalists are becoming aware of this menace , and when enough of them do , Lord Russell will be effectively answered and Communism will be thoroughly thwarted . FREDERICK J. POHL , Brooklyn , April 8 , 1963 , Massachusetts ' Bias Laws TO THE FDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : While I greet with pleasure the passage of the Metcalf-Baker Housing Bias bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it will give New York the most powerful weapon of any state against racial discrimination in private housing . On April 1 Governor Peabody of Massachusetts signed a fair housing bill which brings under the purview of the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination all publicly offered sales housing and all rental housing except for a rental unit in an owner7occupied two-family house . The passage of these two bills will , I trust , serve to offset the defeat of the Berkley housing ordinance . What is clearly needed is the passage of further state legislation where appropriate , the extension of the President 's Executive order on housing to cover all Fed . erally aided and supervised lending institutions , and the vigorous enforcement of these statutes .

Liquor Import Ban Backed Mail-Order Business Said to Violate Law 's Intent To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Times : We refer to an article appearing in your paper of April 4 dealing with the ban on " to follow " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have noted , also , that the American Travelers Club has filed a suit in Federal court asking ha the ban be lifted . Here in the U.S. Virgin Island ; we are familiar with some of the Abuses that have caused the New York State Liquor Authority to talctr corrective action , and we offer yon our comments , as the ban is affect ? ing our tourist economy . The problem seems to have brcil created recently by the introduction of mail-order liquor business . Then : are many firms and individuals par , ticipating ' , and the number is grow . ing . New York State , in particular , seems to have been hard hit . The widely advertised arrangement is as follows : If you are lea wing the United States for 48 hou ? i , you simply mail an order f.orm and your check to an address in Switzci ? land , whereupon five bottles it ' liquor are promptly shipped to your home address in the United State from a free zone in Antwerp . Here is one example of abuse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up and agents are busy taking orders from outgoing Americans . Printed formt are supplied , orders taken and receipts given . Antwerp suppliers ship the liquor to the individual 's address , though the traveler never visits Antwerp . Ban by State New York State clamped do n on this international airport actin it v on the grounds that the agents wol operating illegally without New Yir State liquor licenses , It is our on , derstanding that New York SI a to lost its case on the grounds that I his airport business represented foreign commerce . One way to correct this large and growing movement is for U.S. lawmakers to spell out specifically what must have been the original intent of the Federal jaw , viz. : A bona fide traveler physically present a foreign area where he makes his purchase is permitted to bring ? back or have sent back one gallon . t liquor from the specific geographic area which he visits . The two words " physically present " clearly sin tcil in United States law would stop this abuse . The danger of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1 seems to have emphasized it ) is that it has been made so easy and con ? venient that it is now diverting A large segment of purchasing power away from normal suppliers within the United States to foreign sip pliers , Certainly it was not the intent of the original Federal law that tourist leaving the U.S. could place orders for liquor to he shipped to his home in the U.S. from cities in Europe , principally Antwerp .

NEW YORK TIM ES : While the debate on tax reduct goes on , no one has suggested granting double exemption for wage-ea ilk ers of age 62 , instead of the present age 65 .
