txt ? President Kennedy has been in office this morning less than seventy-two hours , but already it is clear that his assumption of his high office has introduced a major new element into the international situation . Starting with a clean slate , he devoted his eloquent Inaugural Address to making clear his and the American people 's desire for peace with honor . In words certainly aimed at Premier Khrushchev , he declared , " So let us begin anew " in the quest for peace . It was obviously a good beginning , and Moscow has responded positively . Premier Khru  --  shehev 's conference with Ambassador Thompson ? lazt Saturday suggests that the wheels have already begun to turn to produce new negotiations . Pravda and Izvestia printed the text of the Inaugural Address and told their readers yesterday the American people long for peace . The atmosphere has clearly changed for the better . President Kennedy deliberately emphasized the positive in his Inaugural Address . He called for exploring the causes that unite us rather than those problems which divide us . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world : " Together let us explore the stars , conquer the deserts , eradicate disease , tap the ocean depths and encourage the arts and commerce . " But before our hopes run too high , it would be wise to ponder the contrast between these inspiring words and the tone and content of Premier Khrushchev 's latest major foreign policy speech released last week . In that speech he spoke once again as the high priest of the militant Communist faith whose imposition upon all humanity he considers his primary goal . In that speech we were depicted as the enemy who must be destroyed by all means short of World War III . The emphasis throughout was on competition to defeat us , not , as in the Inaugural Address , upon the cooperation of all mankind for the benefit of all humanity . It is in the contrast between these two speeches  --  and in the basic philosophies they represent ? that the hard , obstinate kernel of present international tension is to be found . We do not now seek , we never did seek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other peoples . We do not scheme or plot to have Premier Khrushchev 's grandchildren live under capitalism . We do not wish to " bury " Premier Khrushchev , militarily , politically or economically . It is only because Premier Khrushchev , and Stalin and Lenin before him , have made clear they wish to impose their way of life and their ideology upon us and our progeny that we have been forced to bear the heavy burdens of this most unwelcome cold War . We and the leaders whom we have freely chosen want and have always wanted peace . We are ready to begin anew the quest for peace with honor . But that quest will not be successful if it is one-sided . With the inauguration of President Kennedy , a new beginning has been made on our side . Let us hope that , despite the evidence of last November 's Moscow Statement of eighty-one Communist parties and of Premier Khrushchev 's speech last Jan. 6 , a similar sincere new beginning will be made in Moscow .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
