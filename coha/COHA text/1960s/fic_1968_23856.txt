Harper 's magazine THEY ARE TAKING MY LETTERS a story by Jeremy Lamer WIlie McBain 's conflict with Columbia University and with the Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences thereof came to a head over the thirty credits Willie had taken at Chicago University before deciding to come to terms with New York City . Willie came from Chicago in need of a shrink ; he had not been able in that twisted year in a lost , pointless city to get down to the actual writing of his Master 's paper . He was expecting , therefore , at least in theory , to take both his M.A. and his Ph.D . in his newfound academic community . The trouble was , the lean sad Dean informed him , shuffling papers on his desk , that Columbia had a rule : " a somewhat arbitrary rule , to be sure , but yas . . . " The Dean smiled a smile of worldly resignation . The rule was that if you were taking one graduate degree , you could transfer thirty credits ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could transfer only fifteen . So Willie was required to take fivecourses over again at fifty bucks per credit-hour , for a total of $750 and endless empty hours of his earthly time . He for whom the very word " course " measured one unit of indoctrination into The System I Ironically , by the time a ruling on Willie 's special appeal had been passed down from on high and he had secured an appointment with the Dean to find out what it was , five months had passed with the shrink and even though the shrink himself had said nothing , Willie had fulfilled his side of the relationship by producing a Master 's paper . But never mind that . " Okay , " Willie said to the Dean 's blue protestant mild calm innocent eye ( the other being out of view , its owner having swiveled away as far as form permitted ) , " forget about the M.A. I 'll go straight for that big union card in the sky l " " Well , urn , indeed yes . That would be possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massaging his upper lip . " If one takes the proper steps in a proper sequence 46 THEY ARE TAKING MY LETTERS before a proper date . All quite bureaucratic , you see , ha ha . " The Dean taught a seminar in bureaucracy . His smile , though not without complexity , was met with a glare of pure murder . The Dean stood up , grabbing his pipe with both hands . " Not my department , you know . Good luck , Mr. McBain . I 'm sure things will work out . " The Dean turned and strolled slowly behind a coat tree , from whence issued the sounds of striking matches  --  like rifle fire in a distant wood . Willie , for his part , went straight to the Philosophy Department , where he all but stroked the thigh of the amiable middle-aged secretary . By and by she produced a list of philosophy students who were to receive M.A.s , and after some skirmishing scratched off Willie 's name . And thus passed a year , in which Willie , by offering his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quagmires of Vietnam . Classes did not hinder his own study of philosophy , which was concerned with the implications of personal commitment . The Master 's paper he judged to have been a pretty decent piece of work , reconciling as it did the concepts of Oriental communalism with the implicit psychology of the Kronos-Titan myths . Willie was far from sure he wanted to become a teacher , to assume the role of " professor , " or to force on defenseless students the traditional values of the Western linear dialectic set . But for the time being , he found it meaningful and not dishonest to pursue his own studies into the issues of man 's existence . The wonder of it was how little any of it helped him in relating to his girl Sarah , who that year was finishing college in Philadelphia and fully expecting to marry him in the spring and start dropping babies right and left . Well , why not ? Why should n't she ? It was a question , ultimately , of personal meaning . Willie 's house of hooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbia computer awarded him a Master 's degree . Shaken , Willie went in to see the Dean without an appointment . The Dean controlled himself extremely well . He rose and received Willie just inside the door . Hand on knob , the Dean informed Willie that he had not officially withdrawn his name from the M.A. Iist ; to do that , he would have had to fill out a Degree Withdrawal Jeremy Larner is the author of two novels , " Drive He Said " and " The Answer . " His report on " The Court-Martial of Captain Noyd " appeared in " Harper 's " June issue . He writes frequently for " Dissent , " " Paris Review , " and other magazines . Form and a special card to stop-circuit his punched matriculation slip . The Dean then opened the door . so that Willie could pass out into the corridor from which he had improperly made entrance . But Willie did n't pass out , he passed further in  --  in fact seated himself in the upper-executive reclining swivel armchair the Dean had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you tell me that before ? " Willie cheerfully inquired . " It was not my department . It is still not . I 'm afraid I must ask you to leave now , old chap . Congratulations on your degree . " " I 'll tell you what , " said Willie . " I 'd like to refuse that degree . " He was grinning most inappropriately . The Dean would have liked to get behind his desk so that he could press the little button that lit a red light in the office of the University Police . " Surely you jest ! " That was the way the Dean decided to play it . " I ca n't think of a single person who has ever turned down a Columbia degree ! Besides , you know , ha ha , there 's no degree refusal form , " Willie 's face went dead hostile . He leaned forward and crashed his large fist down against the surface of the desk . " Do n't ... talk ... to . . . me . . . that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word at a time . " Now dig this . I am serious . I mean what I say . I 'm talking to you about my life . " The Dean fumbled casually for his pipe . " Yes indeed . . . well , " he said , wobbling the stem between his teeth . He pinched strands of tobacco from a plastic folder and pushed them into the bowl . " It 's not so bad , you know , " he finally said . " I think you 'll find the Columbia degree highly prestigeful . And do n't forget you 'll have a lifetime subscription to the Columbia Forum . " Willie rose . It 's about time , the Dean thought . He was glad now he had n't pushed that button . No need  --  these sort are gone soon enough . But Willie 's thick hands were curled beneath the desk top . In one fluid motion , he overturned the desk and all the forms , letters , and personal belongings informally arranged upon it . A grating guttural rent the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Dean , lighting his pipe at last , strolled from the office to summon help . At the next meeting of the Proctorial Board , Graduate Division , Willie McBain was duly suspended from Columbia University . But fate would have it that Willie 's friend Lichens was just then beginning a neat little career for himself as an Assistant Professor hi Political Anthropology . For once Lickens stuck his neck out in ' Willie 's behalf , and made a telling appeal to the Disciplinary Subcommittee . Willie understood this as Lickens ' thing , his way of relating , and in return he forced himself to express gratitude when the Subcommittee granted him permission to make reapplication . He agreed to submit a letter of contrition , plus a letter from his psychiatrist and a cash bond against future damages . When these documents were duly processed , Willie would presumably be sent an application form for the following fall . Willie spent that summer happily enough as a playground director , and on the side did considerable reading in existential psychiatry . The worst problem was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tremont Avenue in the Bronx . Was Willie supposed to save her from that , when she could n't even save herself ? At that time he could have gotten out of Vietnam by marrying her ; but he preferred Columbia . You did n't have to marry Columbia . One more year , maybe , and then ... Sarah had to face the city , too . She got a job as a social worker in East Harlem . All right ; he would see what happened to her , and to them . He would n't marry anyone just to get out of something . Bad enough , the whole idea of registering your sexuality with City Hall . All summer long , Willie took Sarah into the public parks at night . If she sincerely wanted to know how girls grew up on the bottom of the city , she would have to learn to relax outdoors in the bushes . Early in September , Willie woke one morning to realize he 'd never received a Columbia application blank . He rushed to 116th Street , but registration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wait till February . It was some months before Willie discovered that this time he 'd been a victim , not of Columbia , but of his local Lower East Side U. S. Post Office . For the first time Willie 's life had been damaged by the U. S. Mail . Sure , he had had letters delivered weeks late , or opened , or left outside the box , or in the street , but he had taken up an attitude of cavalier nonchalance toward the Post Office , not yet aware of its key position in the American power structure . There had been a William McBrown in his block about a year before , an accountant who worked for a distributor of pinball machines and who had run away with the boss 's wife . It was he whom Willie McBain 's application had followed , forwarded first to a bank in Zurich , then to smaller towns as the slick embezzler fled gang vengeance through Europe , Willie 's mail finally coming to a stop with the newly deserted ex-wife , now destitute in Lima @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Jeremy Larner 47 mother 's birthday check and then dropped a little basket of opened letters at the American consulate . Willie learned these details only after receiving an " attempt to deliver " notice in his mailbox during Christmas week five months after the application should have reached him . For years afterwards , whenever an important letter was due , Willie awaited the government 's disposition with an anxiety long familiar to the subjects of totalitarian states , well aware that the money or love he so urgently required might well have been delivered into the unscrupulous hands of Wm . McBrown . The post office that had attempted to deliver was in the Columbia zone , where he had since moved , arid after going there and waiting in line forty-five minutes at the " Inquiry " window , Willie was referred downtown to his previous branch office . There he was given his outdated Columbia application , its envelope rich with the incrustations of functionaries the world over , and told that if he wanted an explanation he would have to apply to a certain department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in view of subsequent postal events , Willie was amazed to think he had found out about McBrown in only one full day of asking . His move to the Columbia neighborhood had been a deeply rooted existential action . The wrecking of the Dean 's office had produced in him an epiphany , In the rejoicing of his hands and feet , Willie knew , not just upstairs but in the pulsing of his very cells , how the University had shackled him . Unwilling to confront his true talents , the Great Society had left him enchanted in a junior dungeon , jamming his brain waves with the static of minor anxiety over grades and papers . He had been a sleeping beauty . No wonder he had n't been able to write without the help of a docaroony ! So he had told the docaroony goodbye . He was n't saying he did n't have problems ; to dare health in a sick society a man must be sick . But sick or not , there comes a time when he has to live . Willie told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You got anything to say ? " Willie finally said . " What do you want me to say ? " the shrink replied . " That 's just it , " said Willie , without a backward glance . He sold all his textbooks and moved into a hotel for one-room transients on 114th near Broadway . And he made Sarah move in with him . Words came freely to him now , though he did n't bother with " papers . " He had chosen , freely chosen , to give up the make-work of academic philosophy . If he could help it , he would never again make a distinction . When he put his head through the Dean 's 48 THEY ARE TAKING MY LETTERS window , a switch had tripped inside : he changed fields , and became , from that moment , a free-lance in psychology . Thus the change of residence was more than symbolically appropriate : he was living in one of Columbia 's slum properties , having made the hotel a center of psychically subversive activities designed to undo the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Willie moved uptown around the time the kids went back to school and his summer playground job vanished from under him . When his registration form did n't come through , he decided to grant himself one whole year as Columbia 's psychological free-lance in residence . The draft board assured him that his number was not quite up ; so that even when he finally got an application blank , Willie let the February registration pass him by . By that time he was well into his program of sabotage and harassment . Willie 's chief assistants were two symbolic tenyear-old boys he picked up right on the block . " Joint " was a quick slender Negro , pronounced unteachable when last attending school on account of his miraculous bug-eyed blank stare . But Willie knew that Joint 's grown-up little mind outran his feet . " Cho-Cho , " the Puerto Rican , was phlegmatic ; he used his soft slow body the same way Joint used his face . Cho-Cho made an excellent scout around Columbia , where he spent a large part of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moving freely through their dormitories and desk drawers . On the street , he infallibly singled out the most guilt-ridden middle-class types and clung to their pants grinning up with his open , trusting , culturally deprived grin , until he got the quarter he begged for . He always said , " Mister , " whereas Joint would press up close and sneer , " Hey , man . . " Joint did n't particularly care about the quarter ? his purpose was to " shake Whitey . " His financial needs were well supplied by the delivery business he ran in behalf of certain residents of the hotel and their counterparts in nearby boardinghouses . Joint 's blank face was one of the last a narcotics cop would look into , and his general traveling reflexes were skittish as a silverbug 's . Willie got to know Cho-Cho through Joint , and he got to know Joint through Joint 's mother , Miss Dacron , who was employed on the block as a solicitor . Willie would never have gotten past the sidelong stares and mock greetings if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of arresting Miss Dacron . After a weekend in the pit with the drunkies , Willie returned to find himself fraternally accepted into the social activities of the block . Up to that point he had been Whitey ; from then on they realized he was simply crazy . Once he recognized their unusual talents , Willie made believers of the two boys in short order . He had them up to his room one night , produced a pint of Thunderbird , and said , " Gentlemen , we are going to start a Higher Horizons program ! " They began by stealing food from college dining halls and redistributing it to the residents of Columbia-owned slums . Cho-Cho was a master scout who provided a complete blueprint of the target area ; Joint could wriggle like a roach through the smallest opening ; and Willie masterminded the timing and transportation . Usually Willie went to Brooklyn and borrowed the station wagon his father used for the dry-cleaning business  --  if not , they would confiscate in the name of the revolution a faculty car  --  and by morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before long heavy guard was posted . and Willie turned from food to electronics . With the aid of Joint and an older cousin of Miss Dacron 's , a professional man , he broke into the sanctuary of the computer itself . It would have been too crude to wreck the machine , and besides , Willie had nothing against it personally . Thanks to the infatuation of an academic-type chick who worked at the Columbia Library , Willie had managed an illegal entry into the stacks , where he spent three days gleefully reading up on computers and sleeping in the employees ' washroom with nothing for nourishment but a gross of stolen animal crackers . Within the two hours it took Joint and his relative to loot the outer offices , Willie was able to re-program the computer from start to finish , altering the contents of its " memory " so thoroughly that for the next two months , until a new machine was installed , students received lower bills and higher scholarships , faculty salaries suffered enormous " welfare " deductions , administrative pay was suspended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arts degrees . Next Willie struck at the Columbia subway stop , short-circuiting the third rail and ultimately flooding the whole station , thereby providing its first washing in fifty years . After that he produced an incredible tie-up at the Columbia master switchboard , as a result of which deans and department heads were reached with a few choice verbal messages which they might otherwise have never heard . Running Iow on cash , Willie engineered a daylight robbery of the bookstore . He merely pushed over a pile of faculty-edited anthologies assigned by their compilers to thousands of helpless students at eight and ten dollars a head . Sharp-witted students , some of them recognizing Willie , began to trample the commodities , whereupon Columbia 's loyal booksellers leaped with little shrieks of rage to quell the disturbance . Somehow they slipped and fell among their wares , so that they never saw Joint 's spidery arms creep up over the cash register . Much later , officials found in the looted cash drawer a note from " Jesu and the Christians . " The fresh cash came right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lie low while students were occupied with midyear exams and an intensified police force went from door to door . A day would come , Willie knew , when students would burn their exams and band together in outlaw groups of teachers and pupils ; but for the moment it was sufficient that small-scale destruction was a campus contagion , reaching even to the authoritarian halls of the ROTC , where essential parts were stolen from sixty-three drill rifles . The atmosphere was more ambiguous within the neighborhood at large . Class consciousness abounded , but Willie 's occasional food and cash bonuses had utterly failed to arouse the authentic communal instinct . The trouble was that the Society had ground its poor to a fine pulp . Love did not flow freely from hand to hand ; it was tense , genital , and sometimes hard to tell from hate . Willie was not by nature Pollyannish ; but even if he had been , Joint 's sister , among others , would have quickly de-pollinated him . At fourteen , Joint 's sister was a trim , catlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed fresh milky whites and whose fine-boned face seemed shrewdly pointed with unspoiled carnal knowledge . She was like a young boy , only more graceful and confident . Her breasts were chocolate apples and her little buttocks no more than biceps . One day Willie dropped by with Miss Dacron 's share of Columbia 's reparations and chanced to find Joint 's sister alone . It was only natural that Willie should reach out lovingly to her , but she would n't look at him , she began to flex all over . He caressed her soothingly , and when she mumbled " ho-ass " between clenched teeth , he thought she was saying something frankly physical . But the word " razor " made him hesitate , especially when she produced one and flew at him , deftly nicking his upflung forearms . A moment later Willie found himself out in the street , while Joint 's sister stood above him on the stone porch , clearly unflexed and letting loose a torrent of imprecations on Willie and his relations with his mother , viciously brandishing her razor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part him from his " pale pecker " if he did not instantly " haul ass " out of there ! From his lowly station on the sidewalk , Willie smiled up at her in unabashed lovingness , still humbly offering of himself , never for an instant accepting her distorted and surprisingly rigid concept of him . But his vulnerability was too much for her ; it only angered her the more , to the amusement of such fellow residents who happened to be on the block , 50 THEY ARE TAKING MY LETTERS or , in the case of the elderly old , looking out their windows , including Miss Dacron , who merely laughed and shouted at her daughter like an aficionado at a bullfight : so that Willie was forced to back his way , calmly , through spectators and garbage cans , as Joint 's fierce sister , half his size , stalked him crazy-eyed up the block and all the way to Amsterdam Avenue , where he rightly guessed she would not follow . " Bye-now , " he called , still , for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back and walk away with the easy stride of a man who to his own self is true . It was only through reflex that he jumped at the sound of running footsteps behind him , and came around in a crouch , ready to strike . He beheld two minuscule girls in ringlets , still pregenital , accustomed to seek him out for chewing gum and licorice . Willie supplied them , kneeling so as better to bathe in their sparkling child-softness . He loved to smell them , loved the sensual brush of their starched , ribboned dresses . He had so little time , it seemed , before the environment would weld their natural feelings into a shield of protection . Willie went to Cho-Cho 's sister , Dulcinea. who at fourteen was in her prime , bulging generously but not yet overripely from purple sweater and cold-fire-pink Capri pants . An amiable girl of weak feeling who had spent most of her life indoors , she was vaguely grateful for Willie 's recognition . He found her overly resigned , impregnable to the notion of creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't . Before long , however , he had it too , and he passed it on to Sarah . Which was fair enough . all things considered . All through January and February , Willie regarded Sarah 's dose of clap as a piece of existential morality . Sarah was supposed to be a social worker , was n't she , sharing the life of the poor ? Then let her run the risks ! Sarah disagreed , and returned to her parents . Willie 's own clap was vanquished by a single hypodermic ; so that two months later , when he learned how much more durable it was for women , he ran all the way to the Bronx in his house slippers , waited freezing for Sarah to emerge , then fell to his knees on the icy pavement . Sarah came back to live with Willie that night . He watched fondly from the bed as she took down her thick black hair . The next few moments were the best he had known all year . Afterwards he wanted to tell her so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like hummingbirds . Willie at last was helpless . Sarah had a little taste , a nip , of her future power . Fervently she prayed she were pregnant . Sarah 's clap coincided with the highest damage rate of Willie 's disruptive activities . As winter wore on , Joint and Cho-Cho faded into new enterprises which lured them from their native neighborhood . The Vietnam scene had worsened considerably , distracting student radical concern from problems of fundamental community . Willie was driven to solo diversions , such as faked phone calls and forged letters , wherein the effects of his actions were frustratingly concealed from him . And it upset him , now that he had curtailed his Robin Hooding , to get money from his parents  --  who believed he was spending his year in disinterested research . As if there were such a thing ! But finally , beyond all else , Willie was nervously aware of the beckoning beachheads of Vietnam . Even yet he could have escaped the Army by marrying Sarah . Which was exactly why he would n't . Not that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get hung up on getting hung up on her . He stayed in his room all day while she was out working , slowly kneading his head into the wall . When she came back at night all bright and cheerful , imagining herself of all things fulfilled , Willie went out . He was n't going to let conditions built up in him by the Society spill out into his relationships . The trick was to catch the rays of invisible pressure as a burning glass catches sunlight , and to focus them in a searing beam right back where they came from ! Not yet would he marry Sarah , not until the very end . One night over cold cuchifritos and a hot pinball machine , Willie had a vision of the triumph of love over induction . When the six brutal cracker sergeants forced up his arm to swear him in , he would say instead , " I do  --  till death do me part ! " Then Sarah and he would consummate their troth right there on the cement floor of the recruiting room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . cracking open their shallow eyeballs with the sight of face-to-face interpersonal love ! By the time another summer came . Willie 's various anxieties had collected into a crying need to get his fall registration blank . School was a negative thing , but he had to have it  --  simply to be left alone , to work out his own fate in his own way . He had inquired at the Graduate Division , but had been told he could not just simply pick up his form : its release was authorized by committee action , and therefore it had to go through the mails . That was all right with Willie , as long as he got it . But he waited in vain . And at length there occurred a piece of postal chicanery which cast an unpleasant light on the apparently innocent McBain-McBrown episode of a year earlier . Not that what he had seen at the post office in that year had pleased him . Often uniformed delivery men from nearby manufacturers would run their hand trucks right past a long line at the parcel-post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clerks . The University , too , was a privileged customer , commanding four deliveries a day when the ordinary population had long ago been reduced to one desultory drop-off . And more than once Willie saw the Dean 's secretary step briskly around patient throngs of Columbia slum dwellers to leave off a stack of envelopes at the stamp window . One day in July Willie at last received a notice ' marked " attempt to deliver registered mail . " Upon not finding him home , the mailman had allegedly returned the letter to the post office , where addressee could pick it up after 4:30 P.M. After walking up and down Morningside Heights all day , Willie finally entered the post office promptly at 4:30 and stood in line for thirty minutes to get to the Registered Mail window . Whereupon he was referred to the Inquiry window and went quietly , like the good citizen he basically was . He waited again and got to the bars shortly before 5 : 30 . The civil servant , a sallow , shapeless man whose body spread out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willie might put his business . Willie slid his notice card beneath the bars . The man glanced down , mumbled " McKay " ? or was it McBrown ? ? and melted away . Willie stood for a quarter of an hour in increasing tension while others in line behind him poked their documents at the barred-in clerks . Some were rewarded with papers and packages , others curtly dismissed . But the man . . . Willie could not remember his face . Was he taking a coffee break , napping , gone home , sitting on the john ? Was Willie 's registration form before him , soon to be behind Or was he conferring with the higher-ups over stratagems to avoid releasing the document to an addressee who showed such suspicious ardor to receive it ? The man was back . Not here , " he said . He shrugged and half turned away  --  the sign for Willie to depart , to step aside and let the line move up one place . Willie said , " You mean the registered letter for William McBain ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be here , " Willie said ; " I have a card for it . " The man shrugged . " Were you looking for it all this time ? " The man stood there , his eyes closed , head slumping away . " And did you have the right name , McBain not McBrown ? " " Next , " said the man . a story by Jeremy Lamer 51 " Now HOLD ON ! " Willie thundered . " This matters a lot to me and I want to get it very , very straight . Are you saying that the postman has n't brought the letter back , and I should come here tomorrow ? " " You could do that . " " What do you mean , I could do that ? Do n't tell me what I could do , tell me what I should do ! " The man rolled his eyes and dissolved . Another man came forward , whose head was a hairless mound with eyeballs installed like fixtures . " Are you the supervisor ? " Willie asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell me first if I can hold you responsible . " " Listen , mister , the station is about to close . CoMe  --  rack tomorrow , we 'll go into the whole thine ? - " Walt ! " said Willie desperately . Leaning forward , he-quietly told how he needed the blank to register in school and keep out of Vietnam , how he needed it now , how it had been duly sent him , how he had reported to the post office when directed , how his life had once before been dislocated by mishandling of the mails , and how he feared it might happen again . He spoke at top speed , fearing to let the man reply . forcing himself to be concise , calm , articulate , staking everything on the chance of a human breakthrough . . . . The man nodded  --  Willie 's heart leapt ! The man reached into a warren of lettered cubbyholes , and pulled out . . . a form . " You could fill out a tracer , " the man said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's not it , that 's not it at all ! " " Station 's closed , " the man said . With a lightning movement , he whipped down the metal screen behind the bars . But Willie reached even faster , jammed his hand in beneath the screen , wedged his other hand between the bars , and in an explosion of adrenaline , shot the screen back up . Two inches away , the man was caught blank-faced and blinking , like a bushwhacker in a flashlight beam . Willie 's fingers flicked the man 's blue postal tie into his palm and yanked the puffy face forward into the flesh-serrating metal strips . Willie put his own face up against the jelly eyes that could no longer avoid seeing , " You 're not a human being , " Willie breathed . " You 're a piece of excrement . " With his free hand he wiped the man 's extruded features from left to right across the bars . As a result of Willie 's confrontation , the man had the first original idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snipped his tie , and fell heavily backwards , landing in a mass of letters which flew up into the air like a burst of snow . 52 THEY ARE TAKING MY LETTERS Willie , not-to-be-denied , strained at the bars until they bent . He was going to come in through that window and go through his government 's public post office and the civil servants thereof until he got his rightful letter . But before he could yank the frame out , he was seized from behind and dragged down by sheer weight of numbers . It took nine policemen to extrude Willie McBain from his local post office . As they carried him down the steps , he saw the Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences , with freshly delivered manila envelopes tucked beneath his arm , stuffing a pipe that was n't there as he stood among the crowd of silent onlookers . The sight threw a calm over Willie , reminding him how he had blown his cool and betrayed himself into nonstrategical maneuvers . He instantly grew docile , and trotted along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby bar , the law enforcers left him with but a single escort . Willie managed to trip up the cop and ran into a tene-DADDY by Rachel Hadas These weeks , and up and down , and it goes on . Stay off it for six months , one said . No . Only pulling at the past can bring me up to what is dead . Let me write elegies at last , I said , and then wrote nothing down . But no forgetting . Elegies were all around me : youth and age together or some botched love or any reaching out meant you and me and death . No need to write . Breaking the silences and spaces took more than the violence of time . A fierce loneliness pushed us in and out of town . Country and city : what we fled would follow .

What must be still disentangled was the reason first for seeing things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and legs and never coming back . No , no forgetting . It would be funny , if I loved you less , life 's merciless and reassuring clusters of elegies. meat . He pounded on the stairs with his hand , then ran into the backyard while his pursuer charged up to the roof . Willie spent that night with friends down on the Lower East Side . Luckily the cops had n't had time to take his name and could n't get it from the post office till opening time the next morning . Yet Willie knew that he had broken laws , and must come to court now and openly defend himself . Perhaps he could turn his trial into a confrontation . Ile could imagine how afterwards he would slip unseen from the smoking rubble of what once had been a courtroom , going underground this time for real . At last America would see that napalm was no mere abstraction ! But to get napalm he 'd have to go to his ideologist friends uptown , and the repugnance of that thought reminded him how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longed for the tropic breezes of Vietnam . But even yet all might be averted , if only he could get hold of that Columbia registration form . If he filled out the punched card and fed it to the machine , he would be registered , post office or not . Then he could turn himself in to the police , cop a plea on his escape , plead guilty to peace-disturbing , let his parents pay the fine as a tax on middle-class tranquillity , and go on ahead with his existence . He racked his brain over the whereabouts of the form . If it was lost , destroyed , returned to sender , or forwarded to Peru , he might as well head for the marriage bureau . But there was always the possibility that the postman still kept it in his bag , having stuffed it there on failure to deliver and thinking to turn it in at the post office any month now . The morning sun found Willie lurking behind a smokestack on a tenement roof . Around eleven o'clock he discerned the portly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a cavelike hallway , dumped out his bag , and sat on him firmly while with beating heart he shuffled through the scattered mail . By long-overdue miracle , there it was , marked two cents due ! Happily flinging the mailman his pennies , Willie was off on the dead run for Columbia , where the machine accepted his card and the cashier his check without question . He was registered ! But who wants to be registered ? The pitiful outcome of all his scheming and groveling left Willie humiliated . Sarah came to Willie 's friend Lickens ' house after work that night , bravely ready to meet Willie there and go with him to the police station . She found Willie grinning maniacally and Lickens dis-traught , drinking bottle after bottle of Yoo-Hoo . " He 's not going , " Lickens moaned . " He 's a lunatic . He wants to go to Vietnam I " " Baby , sit down , " Willie said . " You know , somebody has to go . If you really believe in democracy , I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide behind his education ? " " But you do n't believe the war is right ! " Sarah objected . " I knew you 'd say that , " Lickens said . " For that very reason , " Willie told her , " I must go . " His face was radiant with a quiet intensity . " I must convince my fellow soldiers that they can talk personally to the Vietcong , that the Vietcong are fellow human beings , wounded human beings , fighting for what they believe is right . " " Convince your fellow soldiers ! Willie , what are you saying They wo n't listen to you  --  they 'll throw you in the stockade ! " " I 'll ask to serve among the stretcher-bearers , " mused Willie . " I will bind any wound , Asian or Occidental , without asking a man 's politics . " Willie dried Sarah 's tears somewhat mechanically . He knew that ultimately she , too , could transcend the fiction of governments . " Let 's go back to the hotel , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlistment , and we 'll have all night to say goodbye . " " No , I wo n't ! " Sarah was crying furiously . " Go ahead and do any damned thing you like , but I 'm not going to help you ! " Before he could think , Willie grabbed her arms and started to shake her . " Let go of me ! " Her voice was gratingly thin and shrill . " I 'm not your slave ! You 've flipped , Willie ! You 're a goddam lunatic ! " Lickens went into his bathroom all splotched with embarrassment . Sarah was being an incredible drag . It always depressed Willie to hear her cursing in that tiny voice of hers . The more Willie tried to reason , the more out of her box she became . Willie had to leave . He could not bear to feel the bitterness accumulate . Was this the woman he had given up so much for ? " You should ask yourself , " he said , " what motive you have for pushing me toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out in the street , a summer breeze had come up , sweeping the fresh stench of the river into the air-locked city streets . Willie felt purged , relieved , reborn . Back in his room , he dragged out a battered portable and carefully typed two letters . The first was a formal withdrawal from Columbia , the second a personal letter of enlistment , requesting immediate front-line duty , addressed directly to a story by Jeremy Larner 53 LBJ . He awoke in the late afternoon , stumbled down to the corner mailbox , gulped an Egg Creme at the candy store , and returned to his room to await the police . Sarah was there . She had left her work to rush to him . She would n't talk , she just wanted to love him one last time . For two slow hours of the afternoon she threw her small body into his worship , a communion all the sweeter for Willie 's moment-tomoment expectation that the cops would throw open the unlocked door . Finally she slept . Shadows crept in under the blinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his postcoital death trauma . In his exhaustion he saw himself lashed to the jungle floor , while impassive Orientals dropped rice grains on his forehead . When he tried to make contact they sneered at his strange gibber , shut him away from them with wet bamboo shoots wedged into his apertures . They had bedded him in a river ; the blackness pulled him down , massing blankets of suffocation . .. . He rolled out of bed and hit the floor with a smack . Sarah stirred , sighed sweetly his name . Oh how he did repent ! He lay writhing , clutching at the floor , trying to pull something over him , around him , into his mouth ; trying to break free , to dissolve the stuff that bound him , to push back the air . He came to , face down on the tiles of the hall bathroom . Around him , beyond him , blurred the kind laughter of old dark people . He staggered up and tore back to the room . Sarah was still asleep , breathing evenly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her little person , the connection given him on earth . Oh , the wonder ! The delicacy ! The value ! If we can only accept ! With his undershirt he toweled off a layer of latrine from his chest , thighs , and brow . He pulled on a polo shirt and a pair of plaid Bermuda shorts , stuck his bare feet in sneakers . What if his sperm had taken root : helpless , guilt-crippled sliver of a child , with Daddy dissolving on the bottom of the Mekong River ! He charged down the dank linoleum stairs , glancing at his watch , tripping therein and falling one full flight . Ten minutes till pickup . Willie tried to shove his arm down inside the mail slot . The sharp metal edges pressed hard against him  --  a citizen could get tetanus trying to retrieve his own mail ! As Willie stood with his arm jammed in the box , several of his fellow Americans slipped their letters right in past him . Having freed his arm , Willie got out his penknife and pried at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer lightning into the basement 54 THEY ARE TAKING MY LETTERS of the hotel , he borrowed the janitor 's crowbar . But no sooner had he pried up the U. S. Government rivets from the sidewalk , than he caught sight of the red-white-and-blue postoffice truck approaching another mailbox two blocks down . Crowbar in hand , Willie cleaved his way along the crowded sidewalk , arriving just as the pickup man dismounted from his truck . While the man unlocked the box , Willie sneaked up from the street side , quickly pried up the truck 's hood , and tore out a bunch of ignition wires . As the collecter pumped in vain at his grinding starter , Willie ran back to his mailbox , pushing a great wave of stagnant air before him . He put his arms around the box and hugged it to him , as if to squeeze back into his burning heart that ill-considered spark he had let fly towards the all-embracing hearthstone of LBJ . He had one hell of a time getting the mailbox up to his room . Sarah was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's breath . Willie propped up a window and got a can of beer from the miniature refrigerator under the sink . He climbed out on the fire escape , where he could contemplate the brick wall of the airshaft and ponder his position . The dusty rays of the setting sun revealed many others on windowsills and fire escapes , drinking wine from paper bags , playing radios and guitars , laughing , hollering , and shaking down flakes of soot . The poor . Willie thought . We poor . Sarah came back with a happy armful of groceries . Her upset at finding Willie 's mailbox did n't diminish when he began to hoist it out onto the fire escape . But what would she have him do  --  drop in a match and disturb the personal mail of others ? By contrast , Cho-Cho and Joint , peering from behind fake-lace curtains , sized up the situation and broke into unspoiled cheers . No doubt the falling of the three-colored mailbox was an archetypal ceremony , repeated at crucial moments from the beginning of time , drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the collective unconscious of man . The box fell massively , turning slowly as it plumbed the gloomy deep , and narrowly missing an excitable person who at the last moment stepped out from the basement and almost interfered with the flight of federal property . Full-lunged cheers resounded through the air-shaft . Down below , the door of the box popped open , revealing snowy breasts of mail . But Willie could hardly descend into so public a commotion . Sarah fled to the bathroom . but Willie was already in action , pulling on his Western Union official cap and jacket , relics of a three-day career as delivery boy . All set to go , Willie ran down the hall and snatched Sarah off the john . But just when he got her quiet there was a knock on the door and Sarah jumped to answer . Willie had to grab her ; with his hand clamped over her mouth he kissed her ear and whispered that it was probably the feds . Her story was that he had been gone for weeks . He would meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't choke ! " he hissed , and saw her little mouth form silent curses . A loving goodbye , he thought , as he moved cautiously down the metal ladder . By now it was too dark for Willie to be seen on the fire escape . Cops with flashlights prowled below , probing their lights up alleyways and into basement windows . An active populace moved about , sending up shrill shouts in Spanish and black laughter that mixed oddly with the coarse barks of the police . Willie clung at fifth-floor level , where he would have been trapped all night if Joint and Cho-Cho had n't released the brake of an empty squad car double-parked on 115th Street and let it roll downhill towards the Hudson River . Cops and citizens alike charged up the alley and out into the street , leaving the wounded mailbox to the sole ministrations of Dr. Willie . Willie quickly found his own two letters , tore them into shreds , and swallowed the parts containing his signature . Then he made his way to the post office , where a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected booty . As Willie watched , a mechanic drove up in the truck Willie had sabotaged . " I 'm to take that , " Willie said , relying on his self-control and Western Union . Seizing the dutifully offered keys , he jumped in and drove the mail truck back to his hotel , where the policemen restrained the crowds , quickly helped him load the violated box , and wished him Godspeed as he drove away . With the help of the University guard , Willie loaded the box onto the Dean 's new desk in the Columbia Administration Building . As they worked , the two government officers had a friendly laugh together over the filthy cowardice of " beatnik pinko kids . " What a pleasure it is to do a job of hard work with a comrade who understands you ! Willie nearly took the man out for a beer . Willie drove down to the Lower East Side , where he changed back into the clothes he had left at his friends ' house . Promptly at 9 : 30 he parked his mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office of the Community of Love . Sarah was standing on the corner looking orphaned in unpressed chinos and a Peter Pan blouse . She hugged him tightly , digging her little chin into his chest . " I thought I might never see you ! " she sobbed . Willie was surprised . " Why ? Why ? " he pressed her . " Who came ? " " Came ? " Sarah snuffed her tears out in a Kleenex . " Came where ? " " To the door ! " " Oh ! " She smiled cheerfully . " Just some investigators from the post office . To see about your complaint . They were very polite . They had some form for you to fill in . " " ? And you told them ? Yes ? Yes ? " Sarah stood bewildered , not knowing what to answer . She began to redden  --  the first stage of a defensive anger Willie knew all too well . " You did n't admit I live there , did you ? " " Well , yes ... I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Willie smacked his head a tremendous clout . " My God ! My God ! This woman does everything ... everything she possibly can ? . she wants me to go to Vietnam ! " He was kneeling on the sidewalk , holding his battered head in his hands . The effects of everything he had done in the past few days were beginning to tell on him , and he felt terribly alone . He could n't rely on Sarah , or on anyone  --  and in his grieving he took a kind of joy from this . If only she  --  he looked up and found himself alone . Mechanically he got himself together and climbed the stairs to the loft where the Community a 8tory by Jeremy Lamer of Love had gathered for their weekly meeting . Besides Sarah sulking in a corner , only two of the women were unattached . The most obtrusive was Cassandra Sousay , a creative actress of the militant avant-garde , whom Willie had tried once in a fit of compulsive penetration . She kept her fragile person in a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly apart at the first touch of his coxcomb . The other girl Willie had not seen before and regarded now in frank dismay . She was tall and broom-shaped with a thin slice of face and round little eyes stuck solemnly on either side . Moreover she was dressed in homespun buttoned up to her neck  --  and a gray shawl . " The representative from the Sanctuary , " whispered Rack Mellons . Rack was their leader , a man whom Willie respected . He not only looked like Christ , he could tell you something about a Christian sense of humor . " Let us have a moment of silence , " Rack began , " that each of us may consider why he or she is here . " Twenty sober people , sitting on boxes or on the dusty floor , bowed their heads in contemplation of forces far above them . Shoving aside a pile of pastel leaflets , upsetting two loaded ashtrays , Rack seated himself on the desk . " The first item on our agenda ? " " Why do we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others groaned , but Rack was delighted . " All right , forget the agenda . Cassandra will discuss our vigil . " Cassandra 's hands fluttered , for a moment , across the faultless white of her peasant blouse . They collided and sank , her chin rose firmly , and her voice rang clear as a chime . " In accordance with the decision taken at our last meeting , the Community will gather before the United Nations Friday night , to begin a vigil that will last until the atrocities in Asia are brought to an end . In addition , those of us who are so moved will begin a fast ? " " Why ? " Willie shouted . " What good will it do ? We can burn our lamps and starve ourselves to death , for all they care ! We 've got to strike at some basic institution , some place where they feel it , or else they 'll ignore us forever ! " There were stirrings among the Community . " Cool it , Willie-baby , " murmured Rack : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feet , and once more elevated her chin . " No one more than I could appreciate the sentiments of the direct actionist . But basic to us all I think is the concept of the witness . The impor-56 THEY ARE TAKING MY LETTERS tance of the witness has been told many times , but it can never be told enough . It would be sufficient to demonstrate that we as individuals will never acquiesce to the corporate violence of the State . But I think something more is going to happen tomorrow in front of the U. N. There are those among us , myself included if I have the guts , who have every intention of throwing themselves beneath the wheels of moving cars . They will show by their witness that flesh and blood are real , and can not be manipulated like so many dominoes , And we must face it , " she concluded ; " the probable result is arrest . " An elderly painter began to talk about arrest , complaining that since they had no agreement among themselves as to how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so forth , their arrests would be largely wasted  --  in appalling contrast to the arrests of his youth . While he talked , Willie watched Sarah , who sat in the darkest corner , her head flopped hack against the wall . Willie snorted . What was the matter with her ? She would only make it harder for him to say what he had to . In refuting the painter , Cassandra had built to a. rush of lyricism : " . . . What one learns under arrest is one of the great lessons of life  --  next to loving someone or living with them . One must not make rules that will keep the individual from getting the most of his experience . Arrest is a golden opportunity to learn how we react under stress . If you have n't gone through it , I could n't begin to describe it for you . I will say only this : that as a result of reacting freely and openly to my arrest , I have grown as a person . And until each of us can grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , people will continue to dissolve their identities into groups and to rely on force to settle differences . So I think that accepting arrest is a significant beginning towards the kind of social change that William here referred to . " William here smiled wanly and forbore . He had nothing against arrest . But he knew he had only one more to go . If they took him , he wanted to make it count . The shawl spoke up ; Willie strained to hear her . " We must discuss the nature of violence , " she was saying , " or else we may cancel our very purpose in bearing witness . It is so easy to lose sight of the fact that even enthusiasm or fervor can be interpreted as violence . " " But we are fervent ! " said Willie . " Of course we all are fervent in our hearts , " the shawl replied . Cassandra spoke with calm decision : " One ca n't go too far wrong as long as one is firm and loving . Nothing we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love . " The shawl answered pointedly , " I myself consider that going limp when arrested is a form of violence . " Willie could contain himself no longer . " Now get this : when I go limp , I go limp with full love in my heart . I go limp both with my feeling for the officer and my love of those around me . I have no hatred in my heart . I offer only that . " The shawl opened her round mouth to reply . " I have the floor now ! " Willie shouted . " Please let me finish  --  then you can have the floor ! " They waited in silence , but Willie had forgotten everything he meant to say about the post office . Sarah was looking at him now , but with alarm , and Willie 's fury redoubled . He turned on the shawl . " Sorry if I offended your saintliness , But get thee to a nunnery . Quick . Quick ! " When she averted her face , he stepped toward her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't you feel superior ! " Willie warned . " Superiority is a form of violence ! " He felt Rack 's beard brush lightly against his elbow . " Cool it . man , later , later . . " Suppressing his impulse to pound Rack through the floor , Willie twisted sharply away . As he started out the door , Sarah clutched at his arm , with that look of " concern " on her face . He wanted to kill her but he merely shoved her away : she gave a little scream and fell down . The others , still seated , stared up at him with wide holy eyes . " If I 'm a sinner , you 've got to save me ! " Willie told them . And out he went . It seemed to him the whole world was out of its box . But worst of all , he was n't sure . how could he be sure ? He walked up the East River and spent time crossing and recrossing the footbridge to Welfare Island . A person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with in the final analysis . The shrink could sit in his office and answer madness with control , but Willie was out on the streets every day , fighting hand-to-hand with insanity . At opening time the next morning , a band of ten-year-old boys assembled at the neighborhood post office , beneath a plaque which proclaimed the grand motto of the United States delivery system : NEITHER SNOW NOR RAIN NOR HEAT NOR GLOOM OF NIGHT STAYS THESE COURIERS FROM THE SWIFT COMPLETION OF THEIR APPOINTED ROUNDS Willie came at the last moment , carefully dressed and carrying an armful of leaflets . He had briefed the boys meticulously . Led by Cho-Cho and Joint , they would get inside the building and make their protest before the civil service knew what was happening to it . Their main objectives were the bars  --  which they would wipe with acid ; the mail chutes  --  which they would plug with tar ; and the bags of mail  --  which they would empty out for possible redistribution . They would then stage a sit-in on the post-office floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among other things , to deliver mail in person whenever possible , to spindle punched IBM cards , and to use no stamps when mailing payments to the electric or phone monopolies . Turning their coats inside out , they would reveal signs taped to their backs demanding a " Personal , Public , Democratic Mail Service . " Up the stairs and into the post office rushed Willie and his brave young commandos . But the cops had been tipped off  --  hy Sarah ? ? and were lined up inside protecting the implements of postal privilege . Outnumbering the guerrilla forces three to one , the boys in blue pressed forward and dispassionately herded them into a roped-off area . Willie 's troops had only a few square yards in which to turn their jackets inside out , during the course of which they elbowed each other off their feet . They squatted like trapped squirrels while the cops kept meek stamp buyers well out of leaflet-passing range . The post office grew crowded ; word got around and people who had nothing to do with the sending or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had a good laugh at Willie 's attempts to hand leaflets to the relaxed , good-humored policemen , who could n't find it in themselves even to acknowledge his human voice . The boys had set out in fine spirits , but now they began to look forlorn . One lad snuffled hack a few tears , and angrily shrugged off Willie 's comradely arm . A group of Negro teen-agers had entered with Joint 's sister ; their lips curled contemptuously as they called names at the boys behind the ropes . " You a bunch of jive monkeys with you white devil organ grinder ! " hollered Joint 's sister , her face a stiff mask of hate . Without looking , she held out her hand to the " brother " next to her , got it slapped , capered for a moment in joyless glee , then froze in a disgusted slouch . Miss Dacron came in and shouted a series of promises to Joint , who sat in bug-eyed innocence . " You get you head broke , nigger ! " Cho-Cho 's mother appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She seemed to brace herself against a wave of shame ; her mouth set hard , and she a. story by Jeremy Lamer 57 turned and left without a word . A cry of anguish escaped Cho-Cho ; he dodged through the line and ran after her . Looking desperately for a sympathetic face , Willie caught sight of the Dean , who stood near the Inquiry window with a police lieutenant and the alleged postal supervisor . Apparently he , too , had been properly notified . Returning Willie 's gaze the Dean slowly shook his head  --  he felt sorry for Willie ! " I 'll fight you man to man ! " Willie shouted , but the Dean only smiled , his pipe in fine working order . For a little while Willie had got the kids to join hands and sing  --  a tremendous accomplishment , a last treasured token of the work he had done with them and their trust for him . But after Cho-Cho ran , they sat huddled together like little old men on park benches . Willie was in despair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men had come to this : he was reduced to an entertainment , walled off like a performing animal . He closed his eyes against the malice ranged all around him . His neighbors would throng screeching to see the spectacle , then turn docilely to go about their business as usual , while with every passing second , innocent others in Vietnam paid for that business with their lives . While he sat like a fool on the post-office floor , village leaders were being executed in the name of collective politics , and empty all-Americans were swooping down in helicopters , to deposit their payload impartially on all who must be saved . Saving people , that was the style . Hoping to help each individual split himself off and become a responsible person ? that was naive and hopeless . He had a vision of himself in a dark jungle , alone at dusk in a trench . Little shreds of letters were falling through the air like snow . He held up his arms to catch them , but they melted in his hands and trickled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was giving way ; before long he would tumble swiftly into the gloom of a bottomless night . He realized then the mockery of himself and all he stood for . Opening his eyes , he found himself in a pitiful crouch behind the ropes and the wall of blue , his boys slipping rapidly away from behind him . He stood up , stood tall , that he might not be forever ashamed , and cupped his hands to his mouth and roared , that all who had ears could hear , " The post office is a hollow shell ! " He knew he was futile , useless , lying to himself . But he knew , too , how right he was , oh how he was right !
