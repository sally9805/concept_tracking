GREAT BRITAIN <P> " Let us clear any romantic notion of daredeviltry from our minds , " said Justice Edmund Davies before passing sentence on the twelve Great Train Robbers before him . " It is nothing less than a sordid crime of violence inspired by vast greed . " For their parts in the $7,369,000 robbery of the royal mails last August ( most of the money has not yet been recovered ) , seven of the men drew 30 years apiece , only one got less than 20. * " Do n't worry , Mum , I 'm still young , " shouted out one of the men who had received a 25-year sentence , as guards hustled him away . But even with maximum time off for good behavior , he will in fact be nearly 50 when he gets out . <P> The sentences raised immediate controversy . Loud cheers in the House of Commons greeted Home Secretary Henry Brooke 's comment that Justice Davies proved that judges " are not afraid of imposing deterrent sentences . " The Conservative Daily Express saluted them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for defense . " But perennially angry Methodist Dr. Donald Soper called them " miserable and dreadfully unchristian . " The Daily Herald pointed out that the train robbers were not armed , saw the sentences threatening Britain 's " great technical and ethical difference between crimes at gunpoint and crimes without guns . " Since even murderers often serve an average of only 15 years , the Daily Mirror asked : " Does this mean that stealing bank notes is regarded as more wicked than murdering someone ? " <P> By coincidence , as the furor mounted , a royal commission was beginning a thorough review of British sentencing , punishment methods and prisons-the first in nearly 70 years . <P> *They were the most severe prison sentences to be imposed in Britain in this century , except for Foreign Office Spy George Blake , who got 42 years in 1961.
