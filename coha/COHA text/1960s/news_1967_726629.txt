txt Letters Letters KIP TALK To THE EDITOR : Though I found June Bingham 's handbook for nonhippies ( " The Intelligent Square 's Guide to Hippieland , " Sept. 24 ) helpful , my remaining problems move me to make this direct , open appeal to the heads of flower power : Fm not completely with you but I 'm not against you either . I 'm sort of off-center in the middle , marching to the same different drummer only a little out of step . ( I do n't know if I 'm ahead or behind , but that 's beside the point . ) The point is , I would like to be a flower person but I ca n't . Fm too old , too set in some of my ways to drop out but I 'd sure like to . I 'm all for love and beauty and peace . They 're nice things . A gentle person is certainly nicer to be with than a drunken middle-class hypocrite . I do n't accept the wrongness in the middle-class values I grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also know that not all the best things in life are free . I was born in 1938 , which will explain one of my problems . I am caught in the middle of an internal tug-of-war between two generations , diverse ones at that . I can see the good and bad in both . If someone offers me a free meal , I 'd prefer it from Julia Child than from the Diggers . I think your communal living thing would be a fantastic way to live if I could handpick all the people in my house and if my house was a Fifth Avenue penthouse with Tiffany stained-glass windows and furniture by Mies Van der Rohe and Charles Eames . I just could n't be a real hippie by definition . I 'm still too much in my Kierkegaard " put - a - label - on - me - and - you-negate-me " bag . Maybe I 'm a closet hippie . My friends are all dropping out . They 'd rather talk to God than to me . It 's funny , I thought He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love it . And I dig that it is being composed by my contemporaries and younger . I listen to it loud too . Not as loud as you can , I get hiccups and cramps when it 's past the point of enjoyment . Blinding strobe lights make me nauseous but that 's my problem . I try . I smoked pot . I ate three Sara Lee cakes . Three ! I learned one thing , when pot is legalized , the smart money will be in Sara Lee stock . I might as well tell you that I took LSD once . I spent six hours involved with my toenails , thinking about how people neglect their toenails except in the summer and how if you do n't love your toenails you ca n't love yourself . The psychedelic experience changed me for the better but I would n't tell anyone else to take it or not to . I would like to be friendly and say good morning to people and really mean it but someone would spit at me no doubt . The truth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live someplace beautiful and look at trees and flowers all the time and stay high but I ca n't do it . The Do Your Own Thing is the way it should be and it 's the way I live . I do n't want to hurt anyone and I do n't want anyone to hurt me . I think hatred is a waste of time . I wish I believed that peace rallies and marches would change things . , The only thing is , I do n't believe it any more than I can believe in mysticism and astrology . I 'd like to though . I always try . Things are getting better all the time and I 'm trying all the time . Anyway , I was wondering if you could change your slogan to " Do n't Trust Anyone Over 32 " ? Love , MARCIA JACOBS . New York . ? To THE EDITOR : As an " intelligent middleaged square " who has observed , treated and been consulted by many hippies and nonhippie drug users , I congratulate June Bingham on the excellence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , on which my observations differ from hers . It is my conviction that the hippie phenomenon could not exist without drugs . LSD and marijuana are the most publicized but there is a long list of others which are used . A high percentage of hippies are multiple drug users . The drugs they use include the amphetamines ( Dexedrine , Methedrine , Desoxyn , etc. ) , sedatives ( barbiturates , " tranquilizers " and nonbarbiturate // // sedatives ) , heroin , opium , Darvon and various cough syrups . Heroin may be " scorned " but it and other opiates are swallowed , injected and smoked by large numbers of hippies . Cocaine is also used in significant quantities . The chief drug danger may be from LSD as Mrs. Bingham states , but this is by no means proved . I agree that the reports of chromosomal damage to white blood cells impresses the hippie , but the significance of these chromosomal changes , if any , is as yet unknown . On the other hand , the effects of LSD in precipitating psychoses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My own suspicion is that the widespread use of large doses of amphetamines is a greater danger inasmuch as it can lead to serious mental incapacity , brain damage and depression . Amphetamines are frequently taken by vein over prolonged periods and I have seen psychotic states as well as serious malnutrition with weight loss up to 30 pounds and vitamin - deficiency diseases such as scurvy ( since the amphetamines depress appetite ) as a ' result of their use . Contaminated needles used to inject amphetamines have resulted in many cases of syphilis and hepatitis . If it were true that the hippie " faces up to the depth of his despair , " it would indeed be a good thing . Unfortunately , he uses the drugs to avoid despair . I have yet to see one who has actually gotten anything useful from drugs or who even seriously claims he has taken LSD for the purpose a gaining insight into his personality . The selfconfessed reasons for taking drugs are always some variation on what was once called " fun . " Mrs. Bingham is right that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends up with less self-knowledge than his square contemporary . " I would add that his chance of increasing self-knowledge through the uncontrolled use of drugs is nil . The multiple drug users I have seen have become remarkably dull people with little ability to relate to their fellow man in any meaningful way . One further point . Prostitution is certainly not a hippie problem but this ignores the commonplace gross promiscuity among the young hippie girls which results in a kind of devaluation of individual . ity and lack of significant SOUTHERN NEGROES UP NORTH To THE EDITOR : Thank you for Robert Coles ' fine work in " When the Southern Negro Moves North " ( Sept. 17 ) . These are some of the real words , real people , real situations that our hopes , theories and legislation encounter . It reminds me of driving through the cottonfields once , some years ago , with my father  --  an absentee owner  --  who could quash youthful zeal with the same methodical precision he 'd use to wield a flyswatter ( " An uncleared acre do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenant system . He calmly listened to my argument and then said : " You see that house ? I 've got a Negro tenant there . His kids play outdoors . They go to school on the bus . He drives his own car to go into town . Last year after taking care of his family he had $1,500 to put in the bank . How many people do you know who did that ? " When I went back and visited the old place , they told me 11 families had already left , in response to glowing ads , for Chicago . I 'm not passing this along to show " something good " in a system wrong in many more ways than one . But ? like your article ? it tells me these people must have gained nothing at all , and lost whatever was worthwhile . VIRGINIA WATERS . Portland , Ore . ? To THE EDITOR : I do n't think I have ever read anything so sad and heartbreaking for years . And I thank you and Mr. Coles for the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SINCE 1911 To THE EDITOR : Although we are certain it was inadvertent on his part , Sanche de Gramont distressingly made prominent use of the word " Interarmco " in his article about Samuel Cummings ( " Arms Merchant to the World , " Sept. 24 ) . As the result of five years of effort by my company , Armco Steel Corporation , Mr. Cummings and the International Armaments Corporation have been enjoined from use of the word " Interarmco " because it infringed upon our " Armco " trademark . A final order issued April 21 , 1967 , by the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia permanently enjoins their use of " Interarmco " as a trademark , trade name or corporate name . This final order was based upon a decision issued Jan. 11 , 1966 , by Judge Joseph R. Jackson of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia , affirmed Dec. 2 , 1966 , by a three-member Court of Appeals .

CHARLES CLAY DAHLBERG , M.D. Research Psychiatrist , William Alanson White Institute . New York . ? To THE EDITOR : Looking back we oldsters can see how our generation 's rebelliousness against the suffering caused by the Depression , Victorian morals and social injustice has brought unforeseen effects in our achievement of greater economic wealth , sexual freedom and equal opportunity for all . We did not and could not foresee suburbia , the hippies and Black Power . We have certainly given our children a heritage different from ours , one we hoped would be better . As they in turn become adult , we will relax and feel that they have joined us , but their children will similarly face new and unpredictable problems . In this way social change , which we hopefully call progress , is being made . MARJERY BERNSTEIN . Mamaroneck , N.Y . ? To THE EDITOR : The article about hippies is perceptive . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important motivating factor in the entire phenomenon : sex . Okay , I 'm ready for the accusations ? narrow-minded , prudish , frustrated , etc . Nonetheless , the fact is that in the hippie subculture , kids find uninhibited and unlimited expression of their sexual drives . The situation is only partially explainable in terms of identity , social malaise , American materialism and parental rebellion . Underlying it all is the psychological fundamental of undiluted libido . The external flowers and beads are reflections of the internal birds and bees . HERBERT L. SOLOMON . Brooklyn .

TEACH-OUT TO THE EDITOR : The photograph in " Yorty Has His Eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing Mayor Yorty surrounded by a group of " generally hawkish " U.C.L.A. students , may please the Mayor 's publicity department , but it is definitely a phony and needs explanation . The scene is outside the Student Union building while a Teach-In against the war was in progress inside . I recall that as I passed on my way to hear Noam Chomsky 's views of the war , I encountered a sizable crowd on the front lawn and stopped long enough to find out who the guy in the middle getting all the heckling was , and , unfortunately , also long enough to hear the Mayor charging that the teach-iners were dupes of the Communists , etc . Mayor Yorty was the main attraction of the Teach-Out , but even so , it was not a generally hawkish crowd , most of its members being unfortunates like myself who were diverted on their way to the Teach-In .

R. THE NEW POLITICS TO THE EDITOR : Walter Goodman in his analysis of the New Politics convention ( " When Black Power Runs the New Left , " Sept. 24 ) interpreted the whites ' acceptance of the demands of the black caucus as an unhealthy , unpromising expression of masochism . I disagree . A great many whites at the Palmer House resented being asked to accept the 13 demands as one unit , without modification , and being told that the alternative would be a walkout of all the blacks ; they disagreed particularly with the accusation against Israel . But in the end 75 per cent of the whites voted aye . Those I talked with were motivated by a sense of realism and by hope . They recognized that people who are fiercely resentful over countless past betrayals and deeply skeptical that they will ever be treated as equals ? since they never have been before  --  could make extreme demands as an angry expression of doubt : Would the whites acknowledge full equality by agreeing to a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to accept a white set of resolutions ? A considerable majority of the whites were ready to show faith that this was the meaning . I do n't blame those whites who were not at the convention who are indignant at many aspects of the convention , indignant at the white majority , at the blacks , at the brushing aside of democracy in the conventional sense , at the tampering with means to gain an end , at the accusation against Israel . I only ask that they susiond final judgment until the new board has had a chance to get to work . I myself take guarded hope from the fact that thousands of delegates with widely diverse political viewpoints could confer productively for a week ; that at a time of mounting racial violence a basis for mutual trust could be found and an alliance could be formed ; that when the old politics has failed so miserably to solve the tragedies of war , poverty and hatred , a many-sided program to foster change has been at least launched . BENJAMIN SPOOK . New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Jersey Democratic Council , and one of its 1966 primary candidates for Congress . I am flabbergasted to read in " When Black Power Runs the New Left " that 200 votes were allocated to delegates of the Bergen County Democratic Council , a chapter of the N.J.D.C. , at the recent National Conference for New Politics convention in Chicago . Any individuals who attended that convention and represented themselves as delegates of the Bergen County Democratic Council did so without approval , in contradiction to the purposes and principles of the N.J.D.C. , and evidently allowed their enthusiasm and desire for voting strength to represent themselves incorrectly . At its inception , the founders of the N.J.D.C. rejected any third party and agreed to work solely within the Democratic party . Since its inception , the N.J.D.C. has rejected all participation other than observer status in the " New Politics " movement . JOHN L. JOSEPH . Hasbrouck Heights , N. J. ?

REVOLUTION IN GREECE To THE EDITOR : " How the Military Rules 8 Million Greeks , " by Maurice Goldbloom ( Sept. 24 ) , gives a sensational and superficial account of the political situation in my country . It tends to discredit the present regime and to give the impression that democracy is dying in the land of its birth . Military revolutions arise from unhealthy . conditions and inevitably produce : anomalies which may .. be unpleasant , but in making a fair appraisal of the acts of a revolutionary- : regime it is necessary to explore with intelligent political acumen the ethic of the-revolution itself . The Greek ' people , highly individualistic , volatile and democratic , proved beyond doubt in World War II that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be asked , could the army seize power and establish a military government without bloodshed , with little violence , and with absolutely no resistance on the part of a people that is certainly not emasculated ? The answer lies in the incontrovertible fact that the Greek people was deeply disillusioned by the breakdown in recent years of an outmoded and unworkable parliamentary system which bred destructive factionalism and weak leadership leading to chronic instability and the downfall of one cabinet after another . I note that Mr. Goldbloom admits that the American Embassy in Athens is optimistic regarding the outcome of the situation . I do not think I am ingenuous in sharing this optimism . In modern Greek history there is the striking parallel of a salutary military revolt : In 1909 the Military League ( of young officers ) rebelled against the ineptitude of party politics at that time . The result of their revolution was the summoning from Crete of Greece 's greatest liberal statesman , Eleutherios Venizelos , whose private secretary I was for several years . The Military League surrendered the government to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the nation returned to normal democratic life . King Constantine has made it very clear that he ardently desires a speedy re-establishment of democratic government . The military government have given the King assurances that they share his desire . In implementation of these they have appointed a commission of 20 eminent jurists ( some of whom Mr. Goldbloom quite gratuitously denigrates ) to draft a new constitution designed to remove the weaknesses of the old while maintaining the country 's democratic freedoms . The commission has stated that its work will be completed by Dec. 15 . In due course the government will submit the new constitution to popular approval by referendum , and there is no reason to doubt the intention of the government so to do . Certain repressive measures taken by the government in the first days of the revolution were inevitably unpleasant but necessary . These measures have been now greatly relaxed . It is pertinent to mention in this connection that Greece is a very small country on the southeastern frontier of the western world . Greece belongs unequivocally to the West . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to attack but to internal subversion inspired from abroad . Communists are few in Greece but hard-core Communists are ever active in their attempts to undermine the West at its weakest points . The Greek Army and the Greek people are solid in their opposition to Communism . However , the danger of serious Communist penetration was real because of the grave sickness from which Greek parliamentary democracy has been suffering since 1963 . The revolution provided necessary surgery . It is my earnest hope that one day the American friends of Greece , together with the Greek people , will have cause to acclaim the men of the 1967 Revolution as the saviors of Hellenic democracy .
