Flowered spikes of lavender blossoms give the water hyacinth a distinctly delicate air . But no aquatic plant is healthier or hardier . Few multiply as fast ; in the summer months in the tropics , the hyacinth doubles its number once every 30 days . The plant is so prolific that once it takes hold , floating carpets choke rivers , canals , lakes and bayous . It hinders boat traffic and uses up oxygen needed by fish . After years of trying to keep the hyacinth at bay , a group of weed-control experts and navigation engineers-the Hyacinth Control Society-met in Palm Beach to discuss their few successes and many failures with the beautiful nuisance . <P> Although the tangled weed abounds in nearly every tropical and subtropical part of the world , the scientists reported , it can be as unpredictable as it is prolific . It sometimes grows below a dam but not above it . In some places , once destroyed , the plant does not grow back ; in most other places , it returns as tough as ever . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dredges and herbicides , the plants cluster to form islands strong enough to support animals . " You can never let up , " says William E. Wunderlich , aquatic growth control chief of the New Orleans District of the Army 's Corps of Engineers . " I 've seen a 300-h.p. tug stopped tight by water hyacinth . I 've seen grown men walking on it . " <P> In the U.S. , the water hyacinth has been brought partially under control with the familiar chemical 2,4-D . But 2,4-D may harm surrounding vegetation and is expensive to apply . The manatee , a clumsy , seal-like sea cow with a voracious appetite for hyacinths , has proved a devastating enemy to the plant . Manatees have been placed in bodies of water as a kind of marine lawnmower . They , too , have a drawback : they are listless lovers and slow to reproduce . Two of the sea cows were kept in the same tank for two years . They have no progeny to show for their long affair . <P> For all the trouble the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of Britain 's Weed Research Organization , the plant is not all bad . It could be harvested , he said , as a new source of food ; it has about the same nutritional value as the turnip . Little need have little fear that the plant will be wiped out . It once grew only in fresh water , but in Louisiana it now grows in salt marshes , has even lived for a while out in the Gulf of Mexico . It may soon be attacking tropical ports all over the world .
