The Skyway is In default in the payment of the bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skyway Whitton Testifies Before House Subcommittee // due July 1 and foreclosure is a threat , Daley testified . He and other witnesses expressed doubt if Chicago or the state of Illinois could provide maintenance and police services on the Skyway if the bondholders should take It over . End of Hearings Rep. John C. Kluczynski D. , 111. has introduced a bill to have the federal government buy the Skyway and operate it as a freeway in the interstate highway system . The roads committee has held two days of public hearings on the Kluczynski bill . No further hearings are planned . Whitton , the only witness to appear in opposition to the measure said the Kluczynski bill " is in the nature of special legislation since if would provide for reimbursement for one particular toll facility . " Kluczynski asked Whitton if he would not agree that the Chicago Skyway is a special case requiring immediate federal aid . " I do n't agree with that , " Whitton said . " All should be given equal treatment . " He agreed with Rep. Ed Ed-1 mondson ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receivership . " it would be a matter of grave concern " to his bureau of public roads . In answer to later questions , he said he did not know what would be done if the bondholders should take over the Skyway . Brings Up Question It was Rep. William Cramer R. , Fla. who brought up the question of whether the government should pay ? any more than the current market price ) - of the Skyway bonds if it should decide to buy the Skyway . " In our opinion , if there is any purchase of bonds , it should be at the market price , " Whitton told Cramer . Cramer charged that there would " be a 31 per cent windfall to the bondholders " under the Kluczynski bill . He said that the federal government should not be a party to providing such a windfall . Edmonson told Cramer that he would agree that . the federal government should not ' provide a windfall for the bondholders . But , Mayor Daley , Edmondson , said , told the , committee that the federal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Daley testified that federal highway aid money was used to build freeways parallel to the Skyway which diverted Skyway traffic . Hits Daley 's Position Cramer replied that " the Mayor 's position is entitled to about at much weight as a truckload of feathers . " Chicago officials , ' Cramer said , planned and obtained federal approval for constructing the freeways which parallel the Skyway . He referred specifically to the Dan Ryan freeway south , from the Skyway intersection and the 1Cmgery expressway into Indiana . Whitton interjected that it was just as much the fault of the bureau of public roads as it was the fault of Chicago that the freeways siphoned traffic from the Skyway . " We endeavor not to approve a free facility which will jeopardize the bonds and compete with a toll facility , " Whitton said . Rep .. Robert Jones D. , Ala. took Whitton to task for taking the position that Chicago should get no more than the current market value of the Skyway bonds . Jones said that the government is buying real estate . - Talks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones to be dealt with , " not Chicago . He said that if they are willing to sell their bonds for $56 for each $100 of face value , and the government pays Chicago $76 , then either the bondholders or the city will " get a windfall . " The federal government will have to borrow the money at 4 per cent to make the purchase " and the taxpayers get stuck , " Cramer said . Edmondson told Cramer that if the government was going to buy the Skyway at a price based oh the worth of Skyway bonds , then it could get a better deal by withdrawing the Skyway temporarily from the interstate system to force down the price of the bonds even further . " We 've already hit them between the eyes by building parallel roads with federal money , " Edmondson said .
