James Francis Cardinal Mclntyre of Los Angeles , who has had more than his share of troubles with unruly young priests , is currently at odds with a covey of nuns : his city 's Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary . <P> The roots of the quarrel go back to last fall , when the sisters , who have 182 teachers in 35 of the archdiocese 's schools , approved a number of experimental changes in their rules-most notably the right to wear secular clothing , including skirts and blouses in classrooms . Mclntyre , an archfoe of Catholic renewal , let the sisters know that unless they modified the reforms they could no longer teach in his schools . The nuns refused , on the ground that they are directly under the jurisdiction of the Vatican , and last month sent an open letter to parents of parochial-school children declaring that " after 82 years in Los Angeles , we are being asked to stop teaching . " The Los Angeles chancery responded with a frontpage editorial in the archdiocesan weekly , The Tidings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were threatening to leave . <P> As the battle heightened , Los Angeles Catholics began choosing up sides . Public manifestos of support for the nuns have come from the recently formed Los Angeles Association of Laymen , 29 Jesuits from Loyola University , and ten priests and brothers from the city 's Franciscan Theological Seminary . A rival lay group , affiliated with the conservative National Federation of Laymen , rallied to Mclntyre 's cause . Worried about the developing schism , 28 other Loyola Jesuits asserted that the support voiced by their 29 colleagues for the sisters " does not represent the entire religious community at Loyola , " and suggested that judgment not be made " until competent authorities in the church have rendered their decision . " <P> Whether the sisters quit the schools - or are pushed out of them-the real losers would be their students . The Immaculate Heart nuns have a reputation as exceptional teachers . Moreover , good teachers are hard to come by in the city , especially since parochial-school salaries are $1,500 to $2,000 a year less than those in public schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
