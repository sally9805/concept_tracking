Racing neck and neck , the yellow car and the red car both managed to scoot across the railway crossing just ahead of a lumbering locomotive . They barreled around a curve and into a straightaway with a traffic light shining green ahead . Just before they reached it , the light winked red , and two trucks that had been waiting at the intersection started across . The red car stopped in time , but the yellow car ran the light and bulleted broadside into one of the trucks . <P> Its driver was sore , but unhurt . This was fortunate , because he was only ten years old . The near miss with the train and the grisly accident with the truck happened last week on the top of a table in a downstairs room of Toots Shor 's restaurant in Manhattan . It was the semifinal of a nationwide contest with a combination game and hobby kit that is beginning to give the electric train a run for its money . <P> The two-inch cars on the HO-scale track that raced a scale Mille @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Grand National " championship were the products of the Aurora Plastics Corp. , which joined with the Ford Motor Co. in organizing an elimination contest enlisting 1,000,000 " drivers " ' in 48 states ( the state champions ranged in age from eight , for California , to 37 for New York ) . But Aurora 's Model Motoring sets , ranging from $20 to $50 ( individual cars are $1.98 or $2.49 ) , are only one of 13 different lines of miniature electric racing cars that already constitute a $25 million business in hobby shops , toy shops and sporting-goods dealers across the U.S. From fairly simple tracks , they are developing into complex courses that tax the driving ability of both adolescents and adults . <P> One of the best sets is the British-made Scalextric , which costs $49.95 for more than nine feet of track , two variable-speed controllers and two sturdy cars ( Grand Prix racers ) . Strombecker markets models of famous racecourses , has a $29.95 model including a D-Jaguar , a Ferrari Testa Rosa , and a Chicane obstacle strip that permits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The A. C. Gilbert Co. sells a figure eight of track with an overpass and two Corvettes for $29.98 . Aurora 's latest accessories include a lap counter , judge 's stand and turnoff , starting gate , grandstand-and a railroad crossing where a train can mash risk-takers . <P> Grand champion in last week 's contest was Henry Harnish Jr. , 15 , of Whippany , N.J. , who estimates that he has raced against 1,000 other tabletop drivers since he started just a year ago . Henry owns more than 25 model cars , switched parts among them to achieve his championship racer . His prize : a white Thunderbird . He will give it to his father , a factory shop foreman , who will sell the family Mercury ( ' 61 ) and give the money to Henry .
