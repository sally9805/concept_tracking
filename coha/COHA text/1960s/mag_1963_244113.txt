Wives and Lovers perkily proves that the eternal triangle is still good for laughs . The triangle consists of Author Van Johnson , Wife Janet Leigh and Literary Agent Martha Hyer , who sells Van 's novel to a publisher , a book club , a Broadway producer and a movie company ( " Paramount wants it for Burton , O'Toole , Olivier , Loren and Fabian " ) . Not content with her 10% , she tries to collect the author too . <P> <P> At first Janet is blind to Martha 's designs . She is preoccupied with what a sudden half-million dollars will buy for refugees from a Manhattan walk-up-a rambling house in suburbia , a grove of fruitwood furniture , a set of leather elbow patches for Van 's new tweeds . She tries gamely to keep up with hubby 's new country squire pretensions . When Van mentions at a cocktail party that he is thinking of buying a 1929 Lagonda ( an automobile ) , Janet chirps : " He 's just crazy about good wines . " Under the tutelage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is up to , squares the triangle with a retaliatory affair of her own . <P> Along the way to the happy ending , several scenes are stolen by a disarming cinemoppet named Claire Wilcox . Claire , 8 , plays a food faddist who hates to mix up her victuals . To make a snack , she lines up four plates on the table , puts bread on one , lettuce on another , tuna on a third , mayonnaise on the fourth . Then she starts nibbling from each plate in sequence . " It 's a sandwich , " she explains , " only the food is n't touching . " <P> Wives and Lovers is a triumph of script over plot . Working with a worn story line , Producer Hal Wallis has managed to make a movie so amusing that it almost needs subtitles to catch the lines that get away during the yaks.
