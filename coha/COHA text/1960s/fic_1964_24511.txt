Alexander : ( a tender look ) YOU punish yourself- A : Yeah , that 's just what this crazy chick said , Why do you punish yourself , That 's what they always say when you want to find something and you 're looking very hard . You 'll try anything ( emphasizing it ) anything just to find out , and if nothing is available , you go out and force yourself to look ( shot A , in street , walking ) and because YOU 31 force yourself , these crazy people pin a label on it - Masochist , why do you punish yourself ? Alexander : ( pause ) So now what ? A : ( shrugging , shifting mood ) ( Camera dwelling on timbaud , shifting to the Comics ) ...

( shrugs at his own morbid thought ) , Telephone rings . Alexander picking it up-A soft feminine voice , husky , saying over the phone : Is Diana there ? Alex &tier:; She 's gone , Is she coming back ? Alexander : No . This is Luna . How are you , Alex ? Alexander looking at wall , reflecting , hesitant about something . The voice continues : I 'm going to the East , I have a partin a new movie of Godard 's , I 'll be back . Will you still be here ? Alexander , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , pacing to front of abstract lettering hanging on a canvas on the wall , Able.to be read : " Painters paint , Writers write , Poets sing , Killers kill ( read by camera going down from line to line ) . Alexander turning away from tableaux , asking A : Are you a killer who kills , Anthony ? ( going on ) You have never . . . ever , . , betrayed yourself to me .. , ever , it 's sad that you 're this way . . . you insist really on being your own hero in your own little tragedy . Shot : A , s face . His offscreen voice : Words The images begin . Four quick images from Anthony 's mind tumble on screen , each image running through his mind with a click , as from a slide viewer : 1 . A. killing the anake with his knife ( seen later ) . 2 .

Four strong black brothers in furs bearing a pink marble coffin strewn with yellow and black flowers from the plane . Shot of horror on Parents ' faces-Alexander bowing his head , tears on his cheek , Diana looking hard , offended by this heroic act . 33 Images end . Alexander : . . .

He 's done nothing since . He 's lived inside these four walls for more than a year now wrizing to all hours , dreaming thinking imagining having his women around him like little insects , and without knowing it himself , becoming an ultra-sensitive , very tender plant , This wounds Alexander . A long pause . An interior monologue delivered offscreen between the two of them , in urgent , intimate whispers , something they might have said to each other before somewhere in the past : A : ( soft , said quickly ) . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gates of Eden ? Will you let me in ? Alx : I do n't think I 'd let myself in. 34 Camera which has been panning the room during this short interior dialogue , returns to Alx. who is talking more to himself in a wistful vein : We really live like plants though . It 's the wordless part of ourselves where things just happen to us .. , we 're hard on our animal selves , so hard , and we travel such a long way , looking at Dylan blow Up " it 's so hard to on " . . . and so few , SO very few of us young ones ever really make it , ( Turning to A.

Walking to a flat table designed as a chess board , with the pieces on it , all of them white , picks up a castle in his hand , rolling it over , saying a bit more gayly : Alx : So I started playing a game of chess with myself today ( turns to A. ) it makes sense . . . ( camera on the all white chess pieces , AX replacing the castle ) . . . and I shall play until I 've completely lost track of which piece belongs to which , of what belongs to what , of who belongs to who . . and then when the game is over ( he pauses ) . . . A : You 'll what ? Camera on Superman Blow Up , shifting to one of Tarzan .

Goes on talking . As he talks , camera casually panning Anthony as he rises , puts his coat on , and leaves , to go back outside ( to the street ) which calls . He has become really just another object in the apartment . Alexander accepts his leaving without saying anything . His back is turned . He is speaking as if to himself .

Alexander approaching the end , which is played out later in Prison . Anthony , on the street , these words following him , leans up against the blue fence . He 's tired , exhausted , worn out . His offscreen voice whispering , fighting off the desire to give it all up : Words . . . just Words wrapped around Words . Dissolve to Previous Scene 26 . Anthony in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencil : 40 To Be Real ! To Feel ! FREE ! ( But instead of the previous semi-documentary style , this scene is shot again with a closer , realer camera , catching the strong desire in Anthony to achieve what he writes . Dissolve Forest - Stream Temple Time and place and worlds have changed . The City has been unreal , frightening . Here a much more relaxed primitive world  --  that of snakes , slow quiet , but suddenly very fast , very violent , and very dangerous . Anthony moves from the Fear of the Cat into the Dream of the Snake . He will be bitten by it , and he will kill it . And never forgetting it , will journey on into the final , deep-sea world of silence . Then Freedom . A , has gone to the East to fight with the mercenary soldiers against the wild tribes of the Forest . He 's part of a small detachment of fifteen-twenty men resting deep . in the jungle-forest of a small old abandoned Buddhist temple . The relics are broken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' light individual equipment - 41 rifles , small knapsacks , grenade belts . In this temple Buddha still stands , some stray unknown forest people still coming to worship here , There are fresh joss sticks burning . Several mercenaries , mostly black in their early twenties r are inside the temple , sprawled on the floor on their ponchos , a small fire going . One is sleeping , another reheating a piece of meat ; they have killed a wild deer and his half-eaten corpse is still slowly roasting on a stick built over the fire . Several of the blacks are smoking the Forest Hash which they are passing sound in two pipes which are very long and beautiful . They wear an individual mixture of uniforms although their pants are all the same  - -  light tight-fitting breeches . If they wear shirts  --  several are bare-chested with medallions ( Buddhist , Christian , sharks ' tooth , other designs ) and tattoos  --  the shirts are loose , some of them ruffled , and mixing with the camouflage of the jungle  --  green and tan gold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bands around their long hair , silver bracelets , beads , one wears sunglasses , another brother with a thin hawklike nose wears a black bandanna tightly wrapped on his head , as if , like the other brothers , he was just off the city block taking a trip in the Jungle . This is to be kept in mind for the Fate that befalls this outfit results from the fact that they are not really part of The Forest . spite of their disguises , from The City . Very few of them will be able to survive the primitive ordeal of this world , 42 Though th@ outfit has been several weeks in the Forest , the blacks have no beards . A small transistor.radio plays inside the Temple and two of the Brothers are dancing softly to the sound of soul music . The white world is for the most part outside the Temple , sprawled about it in the thick grass , relaxing . Some have beards , others have shaved , but their faces are hard and dirty , dust and dirt is deeply ingrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has kept himself clean , his beard barely visible , although there are small lines of fatigue under his eyes and a small scar under his left eye , the result of a previous wound , not serious . He tends to rub it occasionally . Ironically , in the war , he has become even softer . Time has crumbled : he is spacing himself . The contrast is made then , by camera CloseuPs , of the black and white features , The Blacks are tenderer , softer . The Whites are tired , cruel . The blacks Sing-Dance . Although inside they are as blue as the sky , and scared . Opening Shot ( set to Music , contrasting to the World of Words Anthony has just left behind in the City . 31 . A black soldier with rifle and grenades , but hatless like all the rest , is striding through thick elephant grass and thicket , the camera with him as he walks , catching the effect of the green elephant grass splitting apart 43 as he walks , the sun gleaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then not seen and seen again . From a distance , inside the temple , on the radio , Sam Cooke 's song " Cupid " is playing loud , and sort of sad like all Cooke 's songs , giving a texture of music and sunlight to his walk . He breaks through the thicket into the crystal clear sun shining over the tiny clearing around the Temple . The Whites sprawled about . As he breaks through the thicket , Anthony , wearing silver bracelets and a Buddhist medallion around his neck and a ruffled dirty shirt , his hair unkempt , longer than before , is taking his picture from a distance through a telephoto-lensed camera , which for the first time , he carries with him , Radio still playing " Cupid " . A. snap- ' ping the shutter again . Photographic freeze of Robinson ( the soldier ) , XUSC and Anthony 's first use of his eyes are themes inherent to The Forest .

A. pausing , walking a little bit further away 44 from the temple . A. approaching from a distance Isaac , a moderately tall , slender , muscled Indian , with sharp attractive features , no beard whatever , his long black hair curling down over his forehead , could look like a little boy but he stands there away from the rest , sharpening his long glistening hunting knife . His chest is without hair and he wears a thin loose-fitting vest of black cloth hanging unbuttoned from his broad shoulders . The way he sharpens his knife , with stone and cloth , it is obvious this is his most important possession . A. raising the camera to his eye to take his picture . Through the lens , A , sees Isaac raise his head as he feels the camera on him . Looks at camera . Shakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking back into the Temple after his trip into the white world . the scene in the Temple as described previously , Two Brothers.dancing to the music- He stops at the threshold of sunlight , thinks about taking a picture but knows he ca n't , this wrld in here can not be photographed , He goes and sits by Francis , a brother who is very close to Anthony . He has tender features-A. listening , smoking the bowls as they come around , from both directions . They are all feeling - very nice . On the radio , Smokey Robinson 's " Tracks of My Tears " is playing , and as the two brothers dance , Francis , who has a very high singing voice , though not as good as Smokey 's whom most people mistake for a woman he sings so ' tenderly , starts to sing with the radio : People say I 'm the life of the party cause I tell a joke or two Although I may be able to laugh loud and hardy deep inside I 'm blue So take a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of place If you look closer It 's easy to trace The tracks of my Tears I need you . . .

As Francis sings song , his brand of blues , the camera closes on him ; in the backdrop , Buddha sits . 46 As he sings , the rest do not look at him sing , they know he can sing , they 've heard this song a hundred times , they know it too . They lie where they are , look at what they do , and deep inside , where it 's blue , they listen . The two brothers , on their feet , dance slowly , a few gestures with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tiny circle of tenderness , The pipes continue to circulate , Francis even interrupting his singing momentarily to smoke , hold , exhale , and then sing again . He is not performing , he is just singing along . The smoking of the Hash naturally has some relationship to the surrounding dream world of The Forest , but isn*t really significant and like the singing , is very casual , going almost unnoticed by the camera . The song ends . 33 . Camera dwells on Buddha at peace , another long afternoon in The Forest drifting by . The camera moving to Adams who is very high , off by himself in a corner of the temple . He is one of the whites , wandering through his head , his low interior monologue . . . The monologues here are done swiftly , voices following quickly on other voices . Adams : off ) There 's no entertainment out here . There 's no movies , no shows . . . no girls . . .

His large pink handsome tongue , as he says : Adams : The King has a pink tongue es . He says he eats a lot of chicken * .. there ai n't no chicken here . a. in the forest . King 's voice off following quickly on Adams@ : King : Cotton is easiest to pick , it 's tall , I could pick 600 pounds in a day .

As Adams is wandering around in his head , camera moves from A. to Jeremiah ( called Rhah ) who is strutting up very confidently , his walk snake-like , all waves , undulating . He looks older than the rest , his Origins seem obscure , probably from the South . He speaks with a slight Southern twang . He 's white . 34 . Rhah arriving , standing above the relaxing group , looking them over , a slight malicious smile on his face . Francis looking up , smiling What 's happening Rhah ?

Lerner , the only other white with Anthony and Adams in the Temple , a Jewish looking boy from the City , young and freaky with curly hair , thin ( he was the boy at the elevator in scene 3 ) looks back at &ah,; his tongue hanging out like an alcoholic grotesquerie . And Baaaaaaaal back on you ( delivers it with all the contempt and venom he can , shaking his head , a stuporific look in his eye , making a grotesquerie Out Of what Rhah delivered with a certain style ) . Rhah looking at Lerner hard with distaste . Rhah : If you 're going to do it , do it right . ( Rhah winds himself up and with a dramatic downsweep of his fist , at the same time taking a step with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head shaking , staring wide-eyed at Lerner . ) Draws himself up .

( Stopping ) Whatch you got ? ( Shot A. looking up at Rhah 's face , forced to pay his respecgs , because Shah is really telling the Truth ) Rkrah going on , concluding , drawing himself back up ; more humorously : So put it this way , if I want to pretend I 'm Superman , I will , if I want to let my hair grow as long as Thor 's , I will , and if anybody points his little pink finger at me , 1 ' 11 be in his shit so fast he 'll think speed was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging out there , in the wind , wondering ( Shah wagging his head ) Who was that .

On the radio , which had temporarily broken down during Rhah 's appearance , starts up again , Manny playing 53 with it . As when Francis was singing , most of the brothers have not seemed to listen to F &; &I; make his scene , They hear but they do n't look , as if their ears , eyes , and mind were all separate senses . Manny toying with the radio , gets it playing again but some crazy station and Lili Marlene is being sung by Marlene Dietrich , about ten seconds before Nanny , slightly embarrassed behind his black shades , turns to the soul station , saying : WOW that 's some old time sides they 're throwing at us .

The snake moves with great twists of its body , making you wonder how it can move so fast . Knowing these hands are Death . Camera dwelling on this snake , moving at about five miles an hour , sliding through , over , under , but unable to get Out of the large circle the whites have made around it . We 54 almost sympathize with the poor snake , fighting wildly , Suddenly it breaks through the circle and they . are running after it again .

Wraps it around his wrist ; on the other wrist , coincidentally , he has a replica of a snake done in silver , smaller , three or four coils wrapped around his wrist , The snake crawls up his arm towards his neck . This scene with Isaac and the snake is shot fairly fast , not too dramatically . Long shot of Isaac and snake through the Temple 's sunlight hole . A. focusing his telephoto lens-Taking a picture . Freeze of picture . Isaac seeing A. take the picture ( close shot of Isaac 's eyes ) a virile smile on his face , and wordlessly , because it is his snake , walking out of the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snake , walking in his soft tread towards the temple , the snake now wrapped around his neck ( by now it should be obvious 55 that it is not poisonous ) its tongue and head swaying over Isaac 's chest . On his bicep , Isaac has a small graceful tatoo Born To Kill , Long shot of him approaching Temple . Francis : off ) Crazy people dig snakes , crazy people . A. Violence is like snakes . We hear the snap of his shutter as he takes another picture of Isaac approaching . . . very quick , o , Veq unexpected , , . , Click . Quick freeze of snake 's head swaying . Side shot of Isaac moving , from the waist up . The camera zooming out slowly on Isaac , till it brings Francis and Anthony into view looking through the sunlight hole at the moving Isaac . Francis : ( off at first ) He scares me man , he 's wild , crazy in the head . He plays his knife like she was a woman . A. ( taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny it 's tender , it 's soft .. O it 's SO all alone . Shot out to front of what they see . Nothing . Isaac has already glided in around them , in the tiackdoor of their Temple . 36 . As the camera is focused out through the light hole , there is a slight rustling behind them , the sound a 56 snake makes when it sways . They turn swiftly . Frontal shot of Isaac standing right behind them the snake wrapped around his arm , its head swaying out in front of Francis . Francis does n't move , but his face muscles tighten and his eyes dilate a little . Francis : Do n't fool with me man , do n't fool with me , Isaac smiling . Behind him , still sprawled around , the radio Flaying , are the brothers and Shah and Lerner and Adams , but things are quieter and without looking they listen . Anthony is also repulsed by the snake . Isaac sees this . Smiling a bit , says slowly , Isaac : You been staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a tan ? . . . Like his ( nodding at Francis ) or red like mine ? ( he smiles ) Isaac coiling the snake in the cup of his hand , Offering it up to A. A. hesitating a moment , putting the camera away , looking at Isaac , takes the snake , not looking at it as its wet living body winds through the fingers of his hands , Isaac smiling . A. looking directly at him . The snake winding up Anthony 's arm . A look of comprehensix and relaxation coming into his face . Isaac sees it , Isaac : It 's alive , is n't it ? Anthony nodding , taking the snake in his hands , passing him around his neck , his waist , beginning to feel 57 a tremendous joy in this living wet damp creature , his fear of it disappearing . The snake responding P beginning to calm down on Anthony'sbody . At this point , Isaac says : Give it to me . Anthony hesitating . Attracted by the power in Isaac 's eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his palm . Isaac : ( to Anthony ) Come , They go down together , down the three steps which separate the raised floor around the inner wall of the Temple from the worshipping floor . Isaac leads Anthony up to the Buddha , As they walk , we pick up from the radio the hollow voice of Sam Cooke again , singing " Let 's Twist The Night Away '  - -  almost a four o'clock in the afternoon voice , at the dead end of the day , this accent on Twist , Twist , Twisting the Night Away . Buddha has many arms . Isaac places the snake on one of these arms . Anthony to his side watching . The snake , in the arms of this new almost golden object , starts glistening and sliding wildly through its many arms Isaac drawing his long hunting knife with his right hand from his left hip , his features dedicated , as a priest before the blood-letting . Isaac : ( not looking at A. ) We sacrifice . Quickly he pins the snake 's speeding head With 58 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , a cruel look of brutality on his face . With his left hand , Isaac whips the snake 's *im ? iw head in the air , as if it were a scalp . His arm is quivering . His head is down , the gesture not deing that solemn , but more spontaneous , quick , contemporary , the gesture has already faded , he pulls in his arm . Puts the head to his lips . Drinks . Turns to A. Offers him the head . A. looking at Isaac , powerfully attracted by the look of strength in Isaac 's eyes . Takes the snake head . Drinks . Tastes the blood in his mouth . it goes down strong . A smear of it on his lips making them corral- colored . Close shot of his lips . Close shot of Isaac 's wide strong mouth . A shot , a single rifle shot is heard from out side . Its echo dies . Anthony and Isaac have n't moved . They look at each other . Isaac 's eyes alight with anticipation at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes completely lost in Isaac 's animal eyes , feeling a powerful attraction to this almost human fire . Shot of fire . Scene 1 . Shot , close , of Isaac 's face . Anthony under standing the fire is in people and between them-The rifle shot is repeated . The other soldiers 59 are hurrying out of the temple now , not having been alarmed Buddha . by the first shot . The radio going with them . Shot of Isaac and Anthony standing in front of Solitary shot of the rifle that fired being raised by an arm into the air . Resting in the sky , flat , in Indian style . A cry is heard . ( Explained later , the cry is " Freedom " but in a strange language ) . Dissolve 37 . The screen is in blackness for several seconds . Then a chant begins in the blackness , a Dionysl'an chant or something similar . What is the name of the father What is the name of the son What is the name of the father What is the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joy God of Love . . . Dionysos Dionysos Dionysos ( example taken from " Dionysos in ' 69 " off-Bdway play ) The chant is repetitive , accompanied by a tarnbourine , but in this repetitiveness , in this lack of desire to search for new interpretations , there is a real feeling for love , which is really a source without words . 60 The screen slowly comes to light and we see a young tribe , maybe a dozen , dancing freely in the forest by a stream . Perhaps they are the enemy , it is not made clear yet . They are a mixture of young men and women and their children , white and black . They dance hugging each other , their long hair jumping , in all sorts of love contortions that display their freedom . They are all in love with each other , with their god , with the forest . And easy as it iS to make fun or laugh at , this scene at first must be done with the camera truly involved in their spirit of joy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hair long ; the players young and contemporary looking and above all , to preserve the spirit of the scene , they must move well , in some sort of time to the tambourine , throwing their bodies into it . Ideally , they are naked , and some of them body painted . But barring that , they wear fiasy primitive tribal threads , hand made , of beautiful colors , exposing their handsome bodies . A few wear colorful headbands , all of them some kind of ornament  --  bracelets , beads , native jewels , clasps , etc . The colored tribesmen do not exactly wear the same clothes , as I think they would look sort of silly . Their threads suit them and nobody else and there is no need , to establish any equality/ similarity as far as clothes go , saying that Freedom has no respect for clothes . If they 're not naked , then let them look beautiful with their own motif in mind , What they 61 want to be is left up to them , In his mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of ineradicable wariness at the root of their Freedom , unlike the White who when he loses his mind , really proceeds to lose it , and to embrace the new . Whether the blacks actually dance is left up to them . They could be sentinels in the woods , they could be on the stream watching the others do their dance . 38 , Camera paning up slope from the tribe into the . woods . Their singing carrying with the camera . Long shot of soldiers moving slowly in single file through the woods , in the same combination of clothes as at the Temple , carrying rifles , small knapsacks on their backs , hatless . Having cautiously , Camera zooming slowly into the point man , who is Bunny , the youngest one , set out to prove he 's as good as any man , his features assuming a distorted hardness . Camera now encompassing Lee who is second in the file , carrying a map in his hand , a young sergeant . He is small with a heavily repaired face indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along his jaw to his chin . He wears a red bandanna around his neck . Bunny still in the camera 's eye , turning back to Lee as he hears the sound of the music . Lee gives him a tight look , squinting ; he frequently squints , nervously assuring himself of which part of his face is really his . 62 Comes up on Bunny . Puts binoculars over his eyes . Do not know what he sees . Brings binoculars down . Looks at his map . Is puzzled . Squints . Turns around . Motions to the men with his arm to sweep out downslope , slowly . Finger to his lips to indicate silence , although the men know what they are doing anyway and can hardly see his gestures . The men disappearing in the forest . Frontal shot of them inching down the slope to the stream . Then side view of them approaching . Music growing louder . There are no sentinels around , oddly . They approach the stream and quietly crouch down behind rocks , trees , dead logs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not really excite them , they are much too wary and as a group have up to now functioned as soldiers . Shot of A 's face . A. moving up further , very interested . They have been watching for a while and Uncontrollably , they start inching further up . Francis and another brother joining A. from different sides . They pass each other a puzzled look . Anthony , putting his rifle and knapsack down , taking his camera out and shooting the tribesmen . Shots of Adams , Lerner . Others . 39 . Shot of Lee , his tight body on the ground , his binoculars to his eyes , propped on his elbows looking . 63 Puts the binoculars down . Picks his rifle up , puts it to his shoulder , his eye squinting , medium to close shot , he is an expert marksman , his legs loosely spread and the stock of his rifle deeply imbedded in the shoulder , the rifle slightly twisted inward , his rear elbow coming up off the ground as he sights in ; for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very confident , very precise . Camera dwells on him as he is about to shoot . But he hears footsteps behind him . Takes his eye from the stock , squinting , not looking around . The footsteps getting closer . Shot of the feet next to Lee , On the feet are moccasins , they are Isaac 's , Lee looking up at Isaac , who has a small French submachine gun cradled in his arms , and is looking down at the stream bed . Isaac giving Lee a look and proceeding down to the stream , his action forestalling a massacre . Lee with hate in his eye , staring at Isaac 's back . He squints. 40 , As Isaac walks down to the stream in the Openl a female in the tribe sees him . The tambourine stops . They stop dancing . Shot of one of the tribe 's blacks standing up from where he was watching and warily looking at Lsaac , who walks on down to the stream . Proud , but puzzled for the first time in his life . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small roving tribe , no older than his early thirties calls to him . 64 Peace and Joy1 ( Making with his hand a small sincere gesture , something like this : 9x1 the word Peace , showing the back of his hand , Joy : the front of his hand , implying an empty hand , stretching it , saying : ) Join us . Isaac pausing , puzzled . J &O; are you ? What tribe ? The leader , smiling , turning around to give the sign for more singing , dancing . Join us . Find out . The tambourine resumes playing and the tribes ' people resume their dancing and singing as if nothing has happened . The few blacks are still wary but the whites fall to it and soon are becoming more intense than ever , perhaps thrilled that they are dancing the Passion Dance in the eyes of the cobra with the gun . They carry no weapons . 41 . Shots of individual soldiers seeing what has passed . They start creeping slowly down to the stream . Spreading out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away and sits watching by himself . The blacks in the tribe have become more wary seeing these other soldiers but they cool it although they rightly feel there 's going to be trouble . Lee remains up in the wood . Bunny is the last to leave him . The black soldiers more or less assemble together on a huge fallen log and watch . 65 Anthony with them . The other whites more thinly spread . A shot of Shah looking . The dancers growing increasingly erotic , their limbs interlaced , men on the ground , women passing their bodies closely over them , feeling everywhere with their hands . Shots of the soldier 's faces growing more and more desirous . Isaac , perhaps feeling this desire , wanting suddenly to be alone and think , retreats into the woods by himself , without a rifle , pensive looking . His disappearance is fatal as he was the only force that could have prevented what occurs . The dancers writhe . Suddenly , with a yell , Lerner rips off most of his clothes and jumps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of freedom . The tribe accepts him but with no display . He mixes well , Hs belongs , but his action only agitates further the other white soldiers . Shot Rhah 's face . A hatred for Lerner 's fool ishness on it . Shakes his head slightly , saying quietly : You child - .. You fool . The dancers almost copulating to the music . Not even singing anymore . Shot : one of the males on his knees his head buried in a woman 's belly , her arms around his head , writhing against his head . cut 42 . Bunny heaving the same girl up on his chest , 66 hugging her . She is so far gone into the ecstasy she does n't notice really who it is . He grins madly and starts making off into the woods with her . The other whites with shouts following him , hugging the women like satyrs at the rape , kicking the almost unconscious , helpless men away with their boots , some knocking them away with their rifles . Lerner fighting for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize what is happening and start struggling . A few screams . One heavily bearded white chasing a girl , no more than sixteen , into the stream , thrashing with her . Shah wading out to help her , struggling with the big soldier who throws him off . Shot of Lee in the woods raising his rifle and expertly firing into the water around Rhah , warning him off . Rhah looking wildly up into the woods . A black tribesman jumping on him . They scramble in the water- Shot of Lee , putting the rifle away , looking down at the chaos , pleased . He squints , Does n't move . Shot of Isaac deep in the woods hearing the shots . Turning around slowly , his face muscles hard , but his eyes already resigned to what has happened . He does n't move . Shot of the Rape from behind the brothers who are still on the log watching . Anthony is no longer there . Camera moving to their side , shooting them in profile , watching , resigned , indifferent . 67 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the beginning to the sound of " Cupid " ; rises . I might as well cut myself a piece too . He looks back . They look at him . One starts eating the food he has carried . Robinson shrugs , moves off . 43 . Cut to Anthony . He 's way out in the woods , on the far bank of the stream , opposite his companions , with his rifle looking intently for something he has seen . The music is still playing in the distance but fades as he runs after Joanna . He is not aware of what will happen at the stream . It is before Runny began the Rape , which will be simultaneous with his . Cut to Joanna leaning , her hands behind her , up against a tree . Her naked body painted green like a sn*e-Her face as well . Her hair is blonde . She is a stunning sight . Anthony at last finds her , approaches hesitantly , looking at her as if she were unbelievable , but naturally drawn to her primitiveness . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , not taking his eyes from her . A snake is hanging from the tree above her head . A long pause . Joanna : You 're not scared of snakes are You ? Anthony : No , not any more . J* you 're not scared of me are you ? 68 A : ( hesitating ) No . She smiles . Camera on Anthony , as Joanna says : Joanna : Take your clothes off then . The snake in the tree rustles , Anthony takes his clothes off . Stands there naked in front of her . Joanna : Vho are you ? Anthony : ( hesitating ) Anthony , J : 01 . * . Anthony . Here she either takes the snake down off the tree and she wraps it around her neck , its head swaying over her breast or , more easily done , puts her hand up into the tree and the snake glides around her hand and arm , or she just simply slides off the tree , saying : Joanna : I am called Joanna .. , but Anthony ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head ) will never have Joanna because he is scared of her arEI he will never catch her . . . ( she laughs and starts moving away ) . Anthony watching her . Snake rustles and dry bird calls out of the trees . The distant sound of the tambourine . Anthony who has never really pursued before , begins to follow her . The bird calls increase . He hears the dry dangerous clicking rustle of snakes , which seem to inhabit the forest . He walks faster . She walks faster , not bothering to look over her shoulder . They move from tree to tree , both naked in the green forest . The chase 69 begins , a long sequence . Their movement is deeper into the forest away from the fast-fading music . They increase their speed until they are running as fast as they can through the trees . Joanna is as swift as a deer and always seems to elude Anthony , who is also very swift . But rather than lose him , she hides , and he finds her or she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the only sound their speeding naked feet on the forest floor-As Anthony runs , he sees the snakes in the trees and at their foot , and in his path too but the chase has made a young savage out of him and he runs by these hissing snakes without thought or concern . Just to take her , like his companions are taking back at the stream . The chase is long . He catches her at the base of a tree , perhaps the same tree where they began , the same snake hissing in the tree . They entwine , taking long deep breaths ( shot in slow motion ) they are falling together onto the forest floor , their eyes closed , Anthony SO happy f so out of breath , his breathing her breathing , his low animal moan the only sound now in the forest . ( Shot as they fall together of a snake biting Anthony in the arm ( seen later ) , #is shot in slow motion so that it melts into their fall , also in slow motion , possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they writhe in each other 's grasp like two snakes , feeling , touching , in the wild freedom seen at the dance , all over each other , Anthony 's face in close up , a picture of pleasure and pain 70 and breaking through that to freedom , a great expressiveness in both their faces . The camera leaving them alone , panning slowly back to the stream , passing the trees , the snakes . The pan dissolving , putting the screen in dark ness . Slowly , reluctantly , we come back to The Rape at the stream . 44 . The screen still in darkness . Bunny 's boyish angry voice off : F ? hat 's the matter do I smell bad ? Am I dirty ? Am I ugly ? ( Sound of hitting her ) Hunh , Do n't you people believe in sex or do you just dance , hunh. ( hits her ) Her voicetYou coudl n't understand ! You people could never understand . Bunny : What do I got to understand ? Hu.nh. ( hits her ) How to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying . He hits her again and again , The dull monotonous echo of slaughter on the black screen . The echo fading 45 . On the screen , a shot of the girl lying beaten to death , draped on a broken tree limb . A shot emphasizing horror . She is already very white and looking stuffed . She is the same girl seen earlier in the motorcycle suit , looking at Rodin 's The Kiss . Fossibly a silent shot Of this previous scene , cut short . Camera dwells on this 71 dead girl . 46 . Cut . Anthony springing on Bunny . Trying to kill Bunny , Butit'san even match and they go on fighting uselessly and camera , losing interest in them , pans to tribe people running off into the woods on the other side of the stream like fauns . Some soldiers are standing around the dead girl , some of them amazed that the rape should end in murder . Anthony and Bunny , both exhausted , are struggling off to the side , out of breath . The Leader of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , she dangles wax white in his strong arms , a lifeless puppet . He speaks to the soldiers , clearly , slowly : . All of you will pay for this , black as well as white l . . ( shouts ) you are animalsi you are beasts1 47 . Cut to Leader moving away in the rain across the stream from them , the girl lifeless in his arms , moving up the other slope ( it has begun to rain but we did not see it begin , it is already in progress in this shot ; the rain will continue till the very last scene in the Forest , when it suddenly breaks ) . On the opposite bank , Joanna ( clothed now ) waits at the woodline for the Leader in the same pose of waiting that she uses later when she waits for Isaac at the edge of another woodline overlooking this same stream . AnthonYceases to struggle with the exhausted Bunny and on his knees , dirt all over his face , he looks up and sees her . She sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 72 Leader . Anthony still looking after her . Shot : Anthony running through the woods after Joanna . Shot : Anthony entwining and falling on the floor of the forest with Joanna . The camera doing the same Pan as before across the trees back to the stream . His voice : You 'll have our child . Her : I 'll have the child of many fathers . Pause Him : 1 ' 11 go . Her : Yes . Go and Kill , Him : I 'll come back . Her : No , 48 . The camera pans right into the rain as it heads downstream ( the above voices do not begin until the camera is into the rain ) and picks the mercenaries up later on their march . Long shot through the woods of them walking right down the stream itself , which comes up around their knees . The bush on both sides of the stream is now to0 thick to walk through . They are walking in a staggered double file , one on the right side of the stream , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right , etc . Occasionally , crack6 of thunder come out Of the sky . The rain grows worse . Cries of the deepening forest . 49 . The men are soaking wet . Lee , at the front with 73 : , Bunny , motions for them to take a break . They squat on the rocks on the edge of the stream , pulling their ponchos out and covering themselves up completely , looking like great sad useless tents , hardly paying attention to the surrounding forest . Shot : whiskered old looking Rhah pulling his poncho out , getting into it , his tired lined face peering out from under the hood . Squatting on a rock . Thinking . Pulling out a bowl and a small plastic bag . Pilling the bowl with the last of his Forest Nash . Throws the bag in the stream . Anthony slowly comes up on him . Wearing his poncho which he drapes over Rhah 's head as Rhah strikes a match and lights the bowl . A crack of thunder . Smoke rising from the poncho . Coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thunder peals again . Offers the bowl up to Anthony who , taking it , seats him self next to Rhah and smokes . They both look out into the hard rain thinking . Shot of Rhah 's exhausted face . Camera to Anthony who is staring into the woods on the side of the stream , the rain beating in his face . The camera going to what he sees  - -  a tangle of forest , and leaves falling off the trees , and rare cries . Diana 's petulant voice off : Hide Hide Hide . why do you hide things ? His eyes slowly pan the trees . He answers in a tired voice , off : Because . 74 Shot : A 's face , his eyes cast down . His voice , off : Joanna . * . I loved you . Without you . . . it is darkness . His eyes rising . Shot of the woods . Shot : F &ah's; face in profile . Thinking . Even tually , he says in passing : Isaac did n't come back . During this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Francis and a few other brothers , including the white smoker , Adams , make a slow individual processional by Rhah and A. to take a pass on the pipe . They come by in ones and leave again to go back to their own rocks ; the effect is almost of a ceremony celebrated for the last time . 50 . Lee ( at the front ) semi-shielded from the rain , sniffs the weed in the wind . Looks hostilely towards Nmh and Anthony . His hand goes out to move out and reluctantly Bunny the point man , moves out , the others taking their time rising . Shot from side fading into shot from front of mercenaries moving down stream , Bunny way out in front . The battle that now erupts is not heavy . It is like the snake , very quick and deadly , and violent , it is over fast , brutally , it is achieved almost in silence , and the revenge is almost entire . 75 Thunder peals again . Bunny , still way out front , passes a water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move at the sight of these heavy waterlogged tired objects inching by . Camera , passing Bunny , toward the snake* ZOOIIIS Off-screen , the trickles of stream water and a fast rustling , like a snake . But the rustling is heavier now , like bodies moving very quickly on both sides of the stream Bunny 's face as he hears . He wades out to investigate . The men behind him have n't heard . The stream is deeper where he wades and the gurgling water rises to his waist . The noise stops . He advances down the stream . Shot of the bush he sees . He pans it . His eyes , almost naturally , come to settle on a pair of bare feet painted green like the bush . He goes by it almost , comes back . His eyes tilt up and he sees Isaac standing there next to a tree , looking down at him proudly , knowingly , his face painted with brilliant colors , his whole body , nearly naked , striped like a snake 's , The paint ingrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Camera swivelling around as Robinson hurls a grenade . On one knee , trembling , pulling another grenade Out from his belt . Sound of first grenade exploding-The last sound . Back to silence .

His knife in the air . A hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Isaac . Hesitates . RUGS off to kill again . Isaac looking at the unconscious Anthony . His smashed camera lies next to him . Seeing the dead snake , taking it all in with a little gleam of the eyes , perhaps amused 78 by the irony , and as Joanna runs up on him , carrying a rifle , Isaac bends to quickly cut the poison out of A 'S arm . Joanna feeling Anthony 's brow and the would on his head , her savage look of revenge melting into tenderness , looking at Isaac who nods quickly to indicate he 'll be alright , she runs her hand over his forehend quickly one last time , and runs off to fight . This whole scene could be ridiculous if it is n't done brusquely , swiftly , like a dream in PLqthonyts head . The sound is off again . The battle coming to an end .
