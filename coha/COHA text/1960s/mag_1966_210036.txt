To the editors of the New York Times , the story obviously seemed significant . It began with more than half a column on the front page and carried over to a full page inside . Written by Times Washington Bureau Chief Tom Wicker , the piece was based on a handout : a statement calling for a more liberalized U.S. policy toward Communist China , including eventual diplomatic recognition and admission to the United Nations . Wicker emphasized that the statement had been signed by " 198 academic experts on China , " all of whom belong to the Association for Asian Studies . Happy to have so many experts agreeing with its own position , the Times applauded in an editorial : " The statement on China by 198 Asian scholars-opposed by only 19 other members of the Association for Asian Studies-shows where the weight of informed American opinion lies . " <P> Signers in Dispute . All of which goes to illustrate the danger of making too much of handouts . In a letter published by the Times last week , Wm . Theodore de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Chairman of the Department of Chinese and Japanese at Columbia University , explained that the signers are only a fraction of the association 's 3,374 members . " Since it is a policy of the Association not to take a stand or conduct a vote on political questions , " wrote De Bary , " no person or group can claim to represent the membership . Signers of the statement must have been unaware such a construction would be put upon it by those presenting it to the Times . " <P> The association 's national secretary , L. A. Peter Gosling , associate professor of geography at the University of Michigan , was even blunter . Calling Wicker 's article " factually inaccurate " Gosling estimated that only one-third of the signers could be considered China experts . By paying $15-a-year dues , anyone who demonstrates an interest in Asia can join the association ; members range from anthropologists to theologians to librarians . Moreover , charged Gosling , some of the signers do not belong to the association ; nor was the entire membership contacted and given a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Gosling . " They sent letters to people they knew who shared similar views , and these people sent the material on to others who generally were in agreement . " <P> The drafters of the document-Harold Taylor , onetime president of Sarah Lawrence College , and Betty Goetz Lall , of Cornell University 's School of Industrial and Labor Relations-deny any such intent . As the leaders of the Manhattan-based National Research Council on Peace Strategy , which issues statements on foreign policy , they feel that they consulted enough China scholars on the wording of their paper , and that they circulated it sufficiently . No other U.S. newspaper , however , shared the Times 's enthusiasm for the document . If they ran anything on it at all , most papers carried a much shorter Associated Press story that coupled the scholars ' recommendations with similar ones made by Senator Fulbright . Even many of the papers that subscribe to the New York Times News Service ran the A.P . version .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
