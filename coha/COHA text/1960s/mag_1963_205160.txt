McNamara <P> Sir : Your cover and cover story of Feb. 15 show much understanding and feeling for the man , Secretary McNamara , and the job . I do not envy Secretary McNamara-decision making for the nuclear security of the world must present a tremendous burden-but I applaud him for his firmness and foresight . <P> THOMAS W. HAWKINS Harbor City , Calif . <P> Sir : Secretary McNamara should be reminded , before it is too late , that some problems are too complex and ill-defined for the electronic computer . In meteorology , for instance , we do not have sufficiently valid and powerful theoretical concepts to make the use of the computer meaningful , so it helps very little in weather forecasting . <P> The computer is only a very rapid calculating machine-it is not a substitute for artistic genius , scientific understanding , or informed judgment . <P> JOHN C. TALBOT Los Angeles <P> Sir : At a time when a " balance of terror " is , sadly , the only realistic solution to the problem of keeping the free world out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely sleep more easily knowing that McNamara is at the helm of the Defense Department . <P> EMILY COSTELLO ( ' 65 ) The College of St. Catherine St. Paul <P> Le Grand Charles <P> Sir : There seems to be a little confusion about De Gaulle . <P> In 1940 everybody fought to save his own skin : the English to save England , De Gaulle to save France-his alter ego . I can see nothing reprehensible today in his desire not to let himself and the French be pasteurized , sterilized and homogenized . Anyway , that 's the way they feel about it . <P> OLGA GANNON Van Nuys , Calif . <P> Sir : Grandeur ? What grandeur ? M. De Gaulle mistakes height for depth . TIME confuses egomania with character . <P> De Gaulle 's is the " greatness " of all petty and myopic troublemakers who ca n't see beyond their personal ambitions and/or the absurd glories of some manmade , artificially delineated space-on-a-map to the genuine glory : the ultimate unity of mankind . Spare us such self-appointed saviors . <P> CONRAD ROSENBERG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know Feb. 15 that U.S. Marine officers are as good men as their predecessors were in Theodore Roosevelt 's day . But are Presidents ? <P> Let 's see whether President Kennedy can , in 20 hours , find forceful , effective means to : bust the trusts whose monopoly of labor threatens shipping , the space program and freedom of the press in the U.S. today ; enforce the Monroe Doctrine ; protect U.S. citizens who are kidnaped or robbed by foreign bandits , in or out of office . Teddy Roosevelt could have handled all three jobs in the allotted time and had eight hours left to go fishing . <P> MILTON H. ANDERSON New York City <P> Sir : I am amazed by the amount of publicity given to the announcement that Attorney General Robert Kennedy and some others managed to walk 50 miles . In December 1925 , Miss Eleanora Sears walked from Providence to Boston , a distance of 47.8 miles , in 10 hrs. 20 min . <P> I know because I walked with her . Miss Sears entertained me for dinner that evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows her age better than I do , but she was then in her 40s at least , and could probably outwalk the New Frontiersmen today . <P> ALBERT P. HINCKLEY Orlean , Va .
