Ending a New England vacation , Dr. Jesse James Pone Jr . was driving home to Westbury , Long Island , when he heard a radio report of a double shooting in New Cassel , only a couple of miles from Westbury . At that very moment , said the radio , the man with the gun was barricaded in a basement laundry room , where police had been besieging him for hours . They dared not use force , because the man was threatening to kill the two-year-old girl whom he was holding as hostage . What really gripped Pone 's attention was the gunman 's name : Winston Mitchell . For Mitchell was one of his patients . <P> Dr. Pone raced to New Cassel . Outside the laundry room with the police lay Mitchell 's common-law wife on a stretcher . He had shot both her and her brother after an argument . Mitchell ignored the wounded woman 's pleas to come out and give up the child . Then Pone took over . Pone used Negro psychology-sociology to make his case to Mitchell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barricaded door . " There 's been a lot of talk about the absence of black fathers in black homes , " he said . " I have a responsibility to keep your daughter 's father alive . Black babies need black fathers . " He told Mitchell that his daughter did not need the additional disadvantage of having to say that her father was a murderer and had committed suicide , or had been gunned down by the police . " I asked him if he wanted some other man to be responsible for her education , or walking down the aisle when she got married . I pointed out that his main responsibility was to stay alive for his daughter . " <P> After almost an hour of such persuasion , Dr. Pone got Mitchell to open the door a crack and accept a bottle of milk for the child . The psychology was working . Soon , Mitchell meekly opened the door of his cubicle , put his pistol in Pone 's hand and emerged with the unharmed child in his arms .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
