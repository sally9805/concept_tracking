txt on Britain What 's ahead ... Britons may have to face up to some cold feet over the next two years . Cuts in gas and electricity supplies loom . Demand is outstripping supply in both industries . The Gas Council and the Central Electricity Generating Board ( CEGB ) are already smarting from chilly public opinion . In a recent cold snap , demands for 32,000 megawatts of power were heaped on the CEGB . But the maximum it can muster even under the best conditions is 29,000 megawatts . More and more Britons are now installing central heating . So , gas demand is spiralling , too , by 10 percent a year . New power stations are in the works . But it takes at least five years to build one and put it on the line . A new station at Tipton , Staffordshire , is bogged down by a world shortage of pressure valves and ca n't open . All this is compounded by a too low estimate of future power demands made in the late 1950 's . The power companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there are bound to be a few chilly toes . The Rhodesian crisis seems about to turn up the Voice of Britain 's volume . Britain was once the world 's leading overseas broadcaster . But now the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) is worried . It is n't able to beam its broadcasts powerfully enough into Rhodesia . So it is asking the Voice of America for help . The British may solve this by setting up a sort of " pirate radio station " in neighboring Zambia or Bechuanaland . That would mean that the many transistor radios in Rhodesia could then pick up BBC broadcasts . This move , together with a revision of ideas about overseas broadcasts generally , is likely to boost the BBC 's world coverage . Part of historic Portsmouth may some day perch on stilts . An idea is afloat to extend the jam-packed old port city out over the sea . Portsea Island , where Portsmouth sits , is the most densely populated island in England . And Portsmouth has exhausted its own supply of land inside the city limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harbor on stilts . Portsmouth leaders intend to look hard at the idea . It may be the Navy that sinks the plans . After all , it needs a harbor . However , the city might jut out into Langstone Harbor , which is the nonnaval part of Portsmouth . Trends ... " A paradox , a paradox , a most ingenious paradox ! " chorused the " Pirates of Penzance " in Gilbert and Sullivan 's comic opera . They were not , but they could have been , describing the British Labor government 's present position . The Chancellor of the Exchequer has confirmed that Labor will nationalize the steel industry when they get a big enough majority in Commons to do it . For the present , however , they must trim their sails and steer a Liberal course  --  at least until the next election . In short , the socialists hope to be reelected on a largely Liberal platform so they can enact strongly socialist legislation . A paradox . How and why ... Some Britons do n't think other Britons have the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national drive is mounting to change the attitude . On its success may hang the closing of the trade gap and the end of the nation 's economic woes . For it seems clear the government 's other policies simply wo n't work ? at least not in time . British leaders want more Britons to view work as a service and material progress as the proper and necessary fruit of that service . Work viewed that way means productivity . And a surge of British productivity is what the country seems to need . This is the cycle that grips the economy : High wages are easy to get . Many Britons get as much as they want in four days and then knock off the rest of the week . Production is high , but it is static . Costs are rising and squeezing prices . Profits on exports do n't come easy . Business slackens . Exports get harder and harder to make . The pound is threatened . And then so are jobs . That 's why many Britons think the help wanted is a different view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
