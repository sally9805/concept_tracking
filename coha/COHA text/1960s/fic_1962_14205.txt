Saint-Jean-de-Luz , France . September 27 , 1954 . The backdrops indicate the exteriors of the locales ; and the time of day , which is about 3:30 P.M. There are three areas : Right , Left , and Center . Each is separately lighted , and only the area in action is on full . The others are not only dim , but lit in hues lacking warmth . There are no walls ; the shape and character of each place is formed by furniture and appurtenances . At the right is the terrace of Le Bar Basque , in half-light and cold color . A ONE-ARMED MAN sits at a small table , his beer before him , his copy of Sud-Ouest in his hand . Presently , the WAITER will join him , wipe the table , which does not need wiping , and engage in daily pleasantries . The exchange will be silent , although animated , and punctuated with laughter . At the left is DR . BARCET 'S consulting room , in his offices just off the rue Gambetta . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiologist , is examining a series of large x-ray plates with another doctor  --  CARTIER , a cautious , gentle , older man . DR . CARTIER is asthmatic and displays the symptoms . They sit facing the audience , holding the plates up to the light , discussing the details of what they see . Their conversation , too , is silent . At the center is DR . BARCET 'S waiting room , in full light . It is like a small-town doctor 's office anywhere : haphazard colors , old magazines , worried furniture . The street cries of the rue Gambetta are heard , and gay Basque music played on a flute and drum , by street players . The song : " Jeiki , Jeiki . " A buxom MOTHER waits , breast-feeding an infant . She wears a bandage over her left eye . There are two other people waiting  --  the WERTENBAKERS . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER is an American gentleman , fifty-three years old . He is reading the international edition of Time magazine for September 27 , 1954 . ( There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER , sits nearby . She is a youthful forty-or-so . She is writing a letter on a pad held on her knees . From time to time , she glances up at her husband . As we look at them , we see that he is beautiful , and that she is handsome . His features are odd . His face is markedly asymmetrical . His forehead is disproportionately high . His mustache is nearly white and his gray hair is cropped so short that we can not see how bald he is . His blue-gray eyes blink a lot ( from old trouble with conjunctivitis ) , and his mouth is made up of an enormous upper lip , embellished by the trimmed mustache , and a thin lower lip . When he stands we shall see that he is tall , with good shoulders and thin , elegant legs , a little too short for his torso . His paunch is not as flat as he would like it to be . He has fine , soft skin which has been deeply bronzed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is his deliberate , plenty-of-time-of-day way of moving ; his slumbrous , ageless vitality ; his sense of the decorativeness becoming to a man ; his air of knowing who he is and who you are  --  his grace , that makes him such a pleasure to look at . His voice matches him , and at times , especially when he is excited or neatly high , we shall hear echoes of his native Virginia . As for LAEL , you are caught first by her eyes which tell you all you are entitled to know . She is trim and quick and active . She possesses the gift of adjustment . Her years of living in nearby Ciboure have superimposed a French flair upon her American style . She , like her husband , is a Southerner , but that talent for change has left neither visible nor oral sign of it . She is a happy woman . Charles finishes the piece he has been reading . Everything about it , including the trick syntax , has irritated him . A sound which becomes a word escapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at him and smiles ) p. 3 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Speaking to me ? ( He looks at her ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER What ? No , I  --  ( He gets it ) Oh . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Something ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( He tosses the magazine aside ) This bloody , week-after-week book . Why should I care ? It 's none of my business . Not any more . ( To the ceiling ) Thank you , God . ( He looks at the magazine , picks it up again ) Even so  --  ( He stops ) LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER What ? ( He shakes his head ) Style bother you ? ( She chuckles ) How was it Gibbs said that time ? " Backward run sentences  --  " CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Finishing it for her ) "  --  until reels the mind ! " ( They laugh together at the familiar old crack ) No , that is n't it . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER What , then ? ( He snorts a bittersweet laugh ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Okay . Confession . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) You know what I thought would happen to this when I left it ? p. 4 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Yes . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Unhearing ) That it would fall apart . Poor Harry , I thought . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Good , healthy thinking . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER And look at it . Not apart . Not even worse . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( Teasing ) Better , maybe ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER No . The same as it was before I was on it , during , and since I 've been gone . Makes a man feel mighty dispensable . ( He rises and walks across the room looking , through the wall , at the two doctors ) LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Maybe to Time , Inc. , not to me , sir . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Absently ) Yuh . ( He lights a cigarette . He smokes black ones , a brand of the region . LAEL notices his wave of apprehension and picks up the thread of talk , brightly ) LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER It 's an institution , that 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 5 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER The magazine . Is n't that what we 're talking about ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Oh , sure . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Like the Bronx Zoo . I got to thinking once . When I did that piece about it ? Here 's The Bronx Zoo . Animals , keepers , visitors . Now . Fifty years go by , say . Or more . The same . Except : different animals , different keepers , different visitors . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Zoo . ( He looks at the magazine ) What a zoo that was . Remember when Harry wanted  --  ( He is interrupted by a yowl from the infant . The MOTHER , her mind on other things , has let her breast slip from the infant 's mouth . She puts it back . Silence . Looking at the scene ) I wish she did n't have to do that . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Why not ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Making me hungry . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER You just had lunch . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Outraged ) Just ! It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , listen  --  ( LAEL pretends to be unaware of his anxiety . She laughs ) p. 6 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Dollars to doughnuts that 's what this whole crise turns out to be . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Make that francs to brioches . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER You eat too much . That explains the bellyache . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Plural , please . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER  --  s . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Better . ( He lights a fresh cigarette with the butt of his other . He tamps out the butt ) Three-thirty . Lael , listen  --  ( She considers turning it off again , but lacks the nerve ) LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( Gently ) Yes ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Moving closer to her ) Is n't there something smelly about this appointment ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER No , why ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER This morning : barium for breakfast , okay ? Then I got here at noon , and this guy  --  the radiologist  --  what 's his name ? ( He hits his head ) Lord , it 's gone again . LAEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Barcet . Did his stuff  --  too fast , I thought . So then I asked him if he 'd found what he was looking for , and he said yes and for me to come back at three , when Dr. Cartier would be here . Then  --  now get this , it 's important  --  he took a beat and said make it three-fifteen . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( Calmly ) What about it ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER And he threw in something about Cartier had to come at three on another case . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Well ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER He was lying . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Strong word . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Dissembling , then . I think he wanted to talk to Cartier first . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER You probably got it all wrong . I do n't know why it is your French always breaks down in a pinch . ( They smile together . At the right the doctors finish their consultation , and put the x-ray plates away . They proceed to the center ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Brightening ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an early drink at the ol ' Bar Basque . p. 8 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Barium ? ( The doctors appear , center . DR . CARTIER carries the envelope containing the x-ray plates . LAEL and CHARLES look up . CHARLES rises . LAEL wants to , but holds back , in an effort to appear casual ) DR . BARCET ( To his waiting patient ) Voulez-vous entrer , s'il vous plit ? ( To DR . CARTIER ) Je suis vous dans quelques minutes . ( The woman adjusts her clothing , rises and goes to the consulting room . She sits . DR . BARCET leaves DR . CARTIER and goes to his patient . He begins and continues an examination . At center , DR . CARTIER comes down to CHARLES and LAEL . DR . CARTIER forces a smile ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Well ? DR . CARTIER ( In halting , strongly accented English ) Let me tell  --  careful . It is difficult  --  ( He stops , sweating , and speaks swiftly , mainly to LAEL ) Je prfre vous le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , et en anglais , je risque de me tromper . Vous comprenez ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( To LAEL ) Oh , Lord  --  slow him down ! p. 9 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( To CHARLES ) He wants to tell it in French  --  accuracy . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER But slow for the love of  --  LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( To DR . CARTIER ) Trs bien . Mais je vous prie de parler lentement . ( DR . CARTIER coughs , automatically takes an old-fashioned atomizer from his pocket and sprays his throat ) DR . CARTIER ( Slowly , but each phrase like a single word ) Eh bien . Il y a certainement quelque chose . Sans aucun doute . C'est entre le gros intestin et l'intestin grle et il faut l'enlever sans tarder . ( LAEL looks at CHARLES ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Shaking his head ) Not one word . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Well This is pretty serious . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Shit ! DR . CARTIER Venez . Asseyez-vous . ( They draw up chairs and sit around a rickety old table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses them as he continues . Meanwhile : ) p. 10 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( Quickly , to CHARLES ) Something there , he said . Between the large and small intestine . Has to come out right away . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Did n't name it ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Not yet . ( The next few minutes are difficult . DR . CARTIER makes every effort to speak clearly and slowly . CHARLES understands some of it ; LAEL translates ; the atmosphere grows tense ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Ask him . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Pouvez-vous me dire ce que c'est ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Cancer ? ( He repeats in French ) Est-ce le cancer ? DR . CARTIER ( With a great French shrug ) Ah ! On ne sait jamais . De toute faon  --  il faudra l'enlever , n'est-ce pas ? ( He gets out one of the x-rays ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( On edge ) Go on . DR . CARTIER You see the  --  the  --  chose here ?

I got that , honey . ( It breaks the tension of the moment and they laugh in spite of themselves ) I want to ask him a few things . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Mon mari voudrait vous poser quelques questions . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER If it is cancer  --  LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( To DR . CARTIER ) Si c'est la mauvaise chose  --  CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER What about the  --  the  --  ( He can not think of the word ) Christ , I ca n't think of it in English !

( He rises , CHARLES rises , LAEL remains seated ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Attendez . S'il vous plat . DR . CARTIER Yes ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Slowly ) If I do nothing about this , how long will I live ? ( A look of shock passes over DR . CARTIER 'S face . He grasps CHARLES 'S arm ) p. 14 DR . CARTIER But that would be foolish ! CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER I 'm only trying to consider all the possibilities . ( DR . CARTIER does not get this .

CHARLES starts out . LAEL comes to the doctor . She holds out her hand . He takes it and presses it so tightly that she winces . No word passes between them . She follows CHARLES . They leave . DR .

He hands it to her , and sits beside her ) LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Hold on . Message from on high . It reads as follows : " Dear Dan , It is an emergency , all right , but not one grave enough to make me talk on the telephone  --  not even to you .

As always . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER For me , too . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Wert , do you think I  --  ? ( CHRIS comes in , in his positive way , carrying his guitar in its battered case .

His bare legs stick a long way out of his short French pants ) CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER What now ? AMA Tu vas mourir de froid . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER No , I wo n't . I 'm roasting . AMA Mets ton pantalon . ( CHRIS responds with the celebrated local expression of indifference ) CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Bawwwww ! ( AMA leaves . LAEL follows her out . CHARLES and CHRIS face each other . CHRIS is a small CHARLES . Throughout the following , CHRIS opens his guitar case , gets out his Estudiantina Society uniform and puts it on . It consists of a large red sash and a matching Basque beret ) p. 42 CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER You 're quite a stubborn type , are n't you ? CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Guess so . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Like me . ( They grin at each other ) CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER You going to be okay ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER I 'm going to do my best to be , but I ca n't promise .

CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Sure thing . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Would it be too much trouble to ask him something for me ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER No . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER It 's about my incision , I mean scar  --  you know . Ask him how come it still itches once in a while , like if it 's very rainy , or sometimes if I stay in the water too long . It itches . I know that is n't much , but it 's annoying . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Nothing worse than an itch . I 'll ask him . p. 43 CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Maybe he 'll give you some remedy to bring back . Some wonder drug ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Maybe . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER He 's a very good doctor . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER That 's why I 'm going all the way to New York to see him . ( CHRIS comes closer to his father ) CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER You sure you would n't like me to come with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Damn nice of you , Chris  --  but I think I 'd appreciate it most if you sort of held the fort here . Looked after things  --  and especially your sister . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Well . I thought I 'd ask , anyway . What time 's it , Pop ? ( CHARLES takes out his watch and consults it ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Twenty to noon . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Oh . ( CHARLES studies his watch . It is a powerful old machine , a legacy from his father . He hands the watch to CHRIS , who takes it carefully , and winds it , gravely . This is a ritual . He hands the watch back to his father . LAEL comes in ) p. 44 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( To CHRIS ) Oh , I 'm glad you 're still here . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Offended ) You did n't think I 'd leave without saying goodbye , did you ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Well , no  --  CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Jim-min-eee !

Or this one , even . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER We 're overweight now . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER And I 'm going to be pretty tied up , seems like . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Picking up his guitar ) Well . I think I 'll shove off . ( He goes to his father and kisses him hastily on both checks , French style . He kisses his mother and goes ) p. 45 CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Easily ) Fine boy , our son . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER I 've been checking the list till I 'm dizzy . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER I 'm going to make a list of your lists , Miss List . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WERTENBAKER ( Touching his bump ) I seem to have more than I need . ( LAEL looks at him , sharply . TIMBERLAKE rushes into the room , munching on a petit-pain chocolat ) TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER I 'm going over to Ginette 's , okay ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Yes . TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER ( She starts out ) But when you pass you better klaxon so I can wave goodbye or I 'm going to be awfully mad ! ( She is gone ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Looking after her ) Scarlett O'Hara . ( LAEL is ready . CHARLES rises and picks up his briefcase ) LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Well . p. 46 CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Nothing to say , love . We 've said it all . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Yes . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Except this . ( He looks around ) I want very much to get back here . In fact , so much  --  that I 'm sure I 'm going to . ( FRDRIC and AMA appear , and wait . MIRENTCHU appears and waits ) LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER You will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He exchanges firm handshakes with the servants . LAEL , a handshake with FRDRIC ; farewell kisses with AMA and MIRENTCHU . While this is going on , MICHEL and GINETTE come in . They watch , impressed by the formality and the feeling . When the farewells have ended , FRDRIC leaves . MIRENTCHU goes to the kitchen . GINETTE and MICHEL feel left out . They come forward and offer hands to CHARLES . All shake hands . They go to LAEL . She shakes hands with them . CHARLES and LAEL leave . AMA retires to the half-light of the kitchen and joins MIRENTCHU . GINETTE and MICHEL , left alone , shake hands with each other , embrace and execute a double , two-cheek kiss . They join hands and leave together as the lights fade to half , center . The full stage fades to black . In the between-scenes darkness , the sounds of Ciboure fade , overlapping with the fading-in sounds of New York : overhead planes , traffic and more traffic , sirens , pneumatic drills , radios , distant ships ' whistles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Scene 3 SCENE THREE New York City . October 8 , 1954 . The sounds of the city fade and continue dimly throughout the scene . The backdrops suggest the exteriors of the areas before them . It is night . At the right is the office of DR . JAMES DANIELSON in the West Side Hospital , in half-light . It is a small middle-aged institution with a prevailingly Spanish atmosphere , its staff and patients being predominantly Mexican and Puerto Rican . Signs are in Spanish and English . DR . DANIELSON is checking CHARLES 's x-ray plates with DR . MARTINEZ and two other young doctors : SALA and GERSHKORN . In contrast to the provincial French office , this one is well-equipped and impressive . For example , the x-ray plate-reading machine holds four plates simultaneously . The conference is not heard . At the left is the coffee shop of the hospital . There are two small tables down front and behind them a counter , usually occupied by interns and nurses . They eat , drink , flirt , study , and rest here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the action is soundless . At center is the room to which CHARLES has been assigned . It is small , impersonal and unfriendly . The general color effect is beige . There is a severe bureau and one straight chair , an enameled hospital bed and side table , and a maple easy chair with flat , hard arms , which has been placed in social juxtaposition to the bed . LAEL is in the room fixing a drink for CHARLES with care and precision . There is also a nurse present working on CHARLES 'S chart . Her name is MISS WILLS . She is red-headed and would seem strikingly attractive even if she were not in these surroundings . CHARLES comes into the room dressed in pajamas and robe . He touches LAEL and reflexively smiles at MISS WILLS . She smiles back . He looks out over the city , listening to its noises , sensing its vibration . From the next room comes the sound of a radio tuned to WMCA : jazz , jingles and , from time to time , the insistent undulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 49 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( With a smile ) You always say that . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER It 's always true . ( MISS WILLS finishes her work on the chart , replaces it in its holder at the foot of the bed and starts out . CHARLES pitches his best look at her . She tosses it back lightly . LAEL continues her activity . He turns to look at her . She places a dollop of dark honey in an old-fashioned glass ( recently bought ) , adds a tablespoon of tepid water to dissolve it , cracked ice to the top of the glass , sour-mash bourbon poured over the ice , fine spray from a twisted lemon peel evenly distributed over the top ; the peel is rubbed around the rim of the glass , then dropped into the drink  --  the whole procedure done with care so that fingers touch only the bottom of the glass . She hands him the drink . He samples it ) This hospital may not look like much  --  but it 's three star . You can always tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER That so ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( He takes another sip ) You know how to tell.fine phosicians from quacks ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER How ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER A fine phosician lets you drink . p. 50 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Oh , I know that ! ( In DR . DANIELSON 'S office , the conference ends . The three young doctors leave . CHARLES looks at the capacious , gaudy , overflowing paper shoping bag on the chair ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER What else 'd you buy ? Aside from bourbon , honey , lemon , and glass ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Sorry I succumbed , but you know me and Mr. Liggett . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER He 's got most of my money , that bastard . Come on , what 'd you buy ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Not one thing we do n't need  --  well , maybe one . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Start with that . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER It 's a Slinky . Look . ( She gets it out of its box in the shopping bag . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel spring . She demonstrates it ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER I do n't know how we 've managed without it up to now . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER I thought you 'd feel that . Now . ( She gives it to him , and overturns the shopping bag and its contents on the bed ) Papers . Magazines : like high-class Partisan Review , okay ? Scout knife . Nicotineless cigarettes . Nicotineful cigarettes , just in case . The matches were free ! p. 51 CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Wait till you try to light them . I know these free matches . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( Continuing ) Two glass ash trays  --  CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER For a man with a glass ash ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( Ignoring the joke ) Paperback Shakespeare . Four tragedies for the price of one . Tragedy sale . Yardley 's shaving bowl , that 's for you . Gumdrops . Mints . Two Almond Joys ( I 'm hooked ! ) . Sight-savers . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER What 're they for ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( Logically ) Saving sight , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them , look ! Pads , toothpowder , cheese and crackers . Also Doze pills and No-Doze pills . ( They look at the spread-out pile ) Voil ! The United States of America . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Like the fellow says . If the Germans or the Russians ever invade this country , they 'll never get past the first drugstore . ( LAEL puts the things away : some of them back into the bag , others in the bureau or on the night table . During this ) p. 52 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER You think there 's enough air in here ? ( CHARLES takes a deep breath . He is playing with the Slinky ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER If they open me up and find out the octopus is more  --  well , extensive than it looked in the x-rays , do n't let them mess me up . Let me out quietly on the operating table , that 's all right , but do n't let them make a mess of me , huh ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( Shaken and somber ) It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me make it . It 'll be up to you if anyone . And do n't you weaken . You hear me ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER I hear you . CHARLES I 'm counting on you . ( A short pause ) LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER You should have seen the stuff I did n't buy . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Remember Gertrude Stein 's description of the U.S.A. ? ( He draws a billboard in the air ) " Toasted Suzie is my ice cream ! " LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Yes , but what dear Miss Stein forgets is  --  ( She is interrupted by the entrance of DR . MARTINEZ , the young , doe-eyed resident physician we saw earlier , in DR . DANIELSON 'S office . His accent and his attitudes are Spanish ) p. 53 DR . MARTINEZ I am back . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Hi , Doc . This is my wife . Lael , this is my friend Doctor Martinez . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER How do you do ? DR . MARTINEZ ( With a bow ) Seora . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER He 's from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good bullfight talk . Guess where he was July seventh , fortyseven , forty-eight , forty-nine , and fifty ? Pamplona , just like us . He 's a specialist . X-ray therapy . And his wife 's a pediatrician . DR . MARTINEZ ( To LAEL , smiling ) You see , he has taken my case history as well . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( Easily ) What do you think of his ? DR . MARTINEZ All is well . ( LAEL brightens , looks at CHARLES ) All will be well . ( CHARLES permits himself the luxury of momentary relief ) Yes . The growth is small and in ideal position to remove . Right side . Left side is bad . Dr. Danielson is a master  --  what he will do he has done many , many times . I have seen it . ( He pulls a prescription pad out of his breast pocket , and a pencil , and illustrates , excitedly ) See . Here you are . Inside . Here is the trouble . Here , Dr. Danielson makes one incision ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure . Out . Closed . And  --  ( He makes a gesture of finality ) p. 54 CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Can he tell right away if  --  ( He stops ) DR . MARTINEZ One thing per time . Is the best way . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER But how soon after  --  DR . MARTINEZ ( Interrupting ) Usually immediately . But Dr. Danielson teaches us a medical motto . ( He quotes in what he believes to be an American accent ) " Fellas , there ai n't no never and there ai n't no always ! " LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER You say it 's small ? DR . MARTINEZ Yes . ( DR . DANIELSON comes into the room briskly . We see him clearly now for the first time . He is a big man  --  six-three or more  --  and hefty , although not fat . He has a benign , plain face , the ponderous , profound gentleness that can go with unusual size in men or dogs ; and a slow-speaking deep voice . He moves slowly and uprightly , making very certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) DR . JAMES DANIELSON Lael ! LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Jim ! Oh , Jim ! ( They embrace . He goes to CHARLES ) p. 55 DR .

( He is gone ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Shaking hands with Dr. Danielson ) That hand sure feels good , boy ! DR . JAMES DANIELSON Sorry as hell I could n't get up earlier . But this place  --  Anyway , I wanted to have a look at the records first so I 'd know where I was . Absolutely first-rate x-rays , by the way . Who made ' em ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER French doctor . A country boy . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Like you . ( DR . DANIELSON laughs ) DR . JAMES DANIELSON Not any more . You should see me in white tie and tails . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER That must be a sight . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Down to business ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DANIELSON ( Stalling ) Let 's do a go-over first and mastermind it later , shall we ? Get some of those clothes off . ( He looks at LAEL , indicating that she is to leave ) Lael ? p. 56 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Oh , sure . ( To CHARLES ) Do n't let him hurt you . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER He would n't dare . ( LAEL goes . CHARLES removes his robe and lies on the bed . DR . DANIELSON begins a routine examination , during which they talk easily ) Chris sends his love . DR . JAMES DANIELSON ( Concentrating ) Give him mine . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Think I 'll be able to ? DR . JAMES DANIELSON What ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Get back there ? DR . JAMES DANIELSON Bet your life . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Breathing deeply and regularly ) I am . I 'm betting it on you . ( DR . DANIELSON steps away and points a finger at CHARLES ) DR . JAMES DANIELSON ( Seriously ) Cut that out , Wert . Doctors are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WERTENBAKER He says his scar itches . What should he do ? DR . JAMES DANIELSON Scratch it ! p. 57 CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER You sure you 've got a degree ? ( DR . DANIELSON looks over CHARLES 'S chart ) DR . JAMES DANIELSON Now . Describe the pain .

After a time , TOM distributes the drinks ) p. 71 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER I 'm sure he meant this for all of us .

There 's no trouble on that account . He 'll recover from the surgery fairly quickly , I 'd say . But he will not recover from the disease . It 's hit his liver , Lael . All over it . A nondispensable organ . There 's no question about any of this . I ca n't tell you how sorry I am . ( LAEL seems to be making an effort to breathe .

How much good time ? DR . JAMES DANIELSON I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then  --  guess ! ( Her tone forces an answer he would not normally have given ) DR . JAMES DANIELSON Three months .

Nothing to do with his desires , you understand  --  but I do n't believe in prolonging life at the price of suffering . Not when there 's not a chance it can be saved .

Several biopsies . Seems to be slow growing . Of course , the operation itself may have done some scattering  --  ca n't be helped . There are things , new ones every day , that slow them down . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Tell me if I 'm silly , Jim , but is n't there a chance of an all-of-a-sudden breakthrough in this ? DR . JAMES DANIELSON Some of us think so . I 'm a chemotherapy man , myself  --  but there are other avenues being pursued . It 's agonizingly slow . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER What 's holding it back ? ( A pause ) DR . JAMES DANIELSON Money .

They look for quacks to tell them they can be cured . ( LAEL half smiles and shakes her head at this ) They cling to hope from any source . And why not ? He might fool you and become very religious  --  turn to God  --  ( LAEL makes an amused gesture of dismissal . It irritates DR . DANIELSON ) Would you try to stop him if he wanted to ?

November 6 , 1954 . The backdrop suggests open water , an interior deck , and an exterior deck of the S. S. Constitution . At the left is the WERTENBAKERS ' cabin , in half-light . CARLOS , a Chilean steward , is arranging things in it . It looks festive . There is a vaseful of huge , brown chysanthemums , several gift fruit baskets , a gay balloon , boxes of candy and cookies , a case of champagne , telegrams , and books . At the center is the PURSER 's desk , in halflight . It resembles a counter . The PURSER is in conference with LAEL . She carries , in addition to her handbag , a small case which might be a jewel box . Another passenger waits . At the right is part of the open deck , in full light . There are four deck chairs . Two are vacant , one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wears a topcoat , a scarf and a cap . He is covered by a blanket .

( He collects his thoughts and then speaks as he writes : steadily , carefully , and with enormous resolution . As he gets into it , he forgets the presence of LAEL , never looking at her . He lights one of his black cigarettes , drinks some of his wine or others ' , stops sometimes to wait for just the right word . He is enjoying himself hugely ) Introductory stuff . A factual , objective report . Getting the word from Dr. Cartier . Paragraph . When we left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basque without conversation . The shape of life had changed suddenly  --  no , violently . I did n't know what Lael was thinking , but I was all at once concerned not with illness but with health ; not with death but with life  --  and , above all , with communication . With the desire to tie together the loose ends of my somewhat disordered life . I saw in a flash  --  make that , in an explosion . Parenthesis . Revelation . Question mark . Parenthesis  --  that I had much to do . But all of it exciting and worth the doing . To come to terms with the idea  --  to make a private peace with myself  --  and to end well with friends and family and strangers . To say to all of them somehow , dash  --  live .

She will leave and re-appear in the workroom , where she will take the cover from the typewriter and begin to transcribe her notes . The backdrop lights will go to late afternoon . CHARLES will leave and presently return with CHRIS , each of them carrying a guitar . CHRIS will begin to give his father a guitar lesson .

Vous . tes bnie entre toutes les femmes , et Jsus le fruit de vos entrailles ( The lights in the kitchen fade to half as the lights in the workroom come up full .

LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER What do you think you 'll wear ? ( They continue to confer . The lights go to half on the workroom and come up full on the main room in the center . The backdrop goes to dusk . CHRIS and CHARLES are working over their guitars . CHRIS is playing the melody of " Sol y Sombra , " while CHARLES attempts the chord changes . CHRIS accommodates the melody to the imperfect tempo . CHARLES hits a wrong chord ) p. 120 CHARLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Keep goin ' , Pop . It 's in there somewhere !

CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Bravely ) To bottom . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER One  --  two . ( They begin to play together . It sounds fine . CHARLES is playing correctly but at a tempo which is clearly too slow for the song . In the kitchen , FRDRIC has gone , but AMA and MIRENTCHU listen with pleasure . In the workroom , as the music goes on , LAEL and TIMBERLAKE stop to listen . When the tempo is right , TIMBERLAKE obliges with a grand fandango , continuing until the end . CHRIS tries to accelerate , but CHARLES holds back doggedly : Finally ) Faster , Pop p. 122 CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Grimly ) Ca n't . ( They play a few bars , the tempo increasing slightly ) CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Impatiently ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going as fast as I can , goddammit ! ( They stop playing and exchange a look . CHARLES is fuming . CHRIS is astonished . They live a difficult moment . Suddenly CHARLES attacks his guitar playing two chords back and forth with nonsensical unmusical speed . It makes CHRIS laugh . Imitating CHRIS ) Faster , Pop . Faster ! ( CHRIS falls back laughing hard . CHARLES is going faster faster ) @x Ciboure . Christmas Night , 1954 . At center , a family party is in progress . The main room has been decorated , and the effect is a curious mixture of Basque and Alexandria , Virginia . There is a Christmas tree ( taken from the pine woods by CHRIS ) , lighted and decorated nobly . Presents galore . CHRIS hardly stops using his enormous new binoculars ( Army surplus ) . TIMBERLAKE is dressed in a festival frock of the region . At left , the workroom is deserted . At right , AMA and MIRENTCHU are still at work in the kitchen . After a time , MIRENTCHU leaves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and TIMBERLAKE and CHRIS have their backs to the audience . CHARLES is performing . It is still " Sol y Sombra . " It is no good and his audience knows it  --  every mistake gets a laugh . He wears a Santa Claus hat and a beard made of a handkerchief . The number ends on a wrong chord . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Proudly ) There you are . ( Silence ) Want to hear it again ? CHRIS AND TIMBERLAKE No ! ( They scramble off to the tree . Charles puts down the guitar and makes his way forward . He signals to LAEL . She joins him ) p. 124 CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Quietly but definitely ) Get them out . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER What is it ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Hurry up ! LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( Loudly , to the kids ) Okay . Party 's over ! TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER Not yet ! CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER It 's only  --  LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER No fuss , now . I 'm exhausted . ( CHARLES sits down , waiting for the room to clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in control . Watching him , we see that he is pale , that his eyes are framed in dark circles and that his clothes do not fit as smartly as they once did ) TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER ( In a loud whisper ) What about my final surprise ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( With a glance at CHARLES ) Later . TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER ( Overexcited ) There wo n't be any later ! CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Of course there will . Beat it . p. 125 TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER ( Shocked ) That 's a fine way to talk on Christmas , I must say ! ( A family laugh ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Okay . But snap it up ! ( TIMBERLAKE dashes out to get her surprise . Confidentially to LAEL ) Get the hypo going . I think I 'm in for it again . ( LAEL plugs in the water heater . TIMBERLAKE comes back in , bearing a vase filled with flowers . The present is bigger than she is ) TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER Guess what they are ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Flowers . TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER That 's the only flower you know . What kind ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Give up . TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER Hay-fever flowers .

LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( With a touch of impatience ) All right now . It 's been a fine day . Let 's not spoil it . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Holding the kids and looking at LAEL ) It 's been the absolutely best day of my whole life . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER I 'm bushed . TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER I 'm not !

CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER VOICE Bet . ( The moment the kids are out of the room , CHARLES and LAEL go into frantic action ) p. 128 CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Tearing off his jacket ) Oh , for Christ 's sake , snap it up ! LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Yes . ( CHARLES pulls up a trouser leg preparatory to injecting himself with morphine . LAEL drops the hypo into the water heater . CHARLES melts the dosage in a teaspoon . She fills the hypo and just before handing it to him , speaks ) Let me try  --  you 're trembling . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Hell no , you 'll push it at me and wobble and faint , probably . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER No . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Here . ( He takes it and makes the injection neatly . She mops his brow ) LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Relax . He said relax . Remember ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( After a time ) Done . ( He hands back the hypo ) I 'm going to try not to puke this time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armchair ) LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Anything special ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER What 's on ? p. 129 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Rosenkavalier . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER That 'll do . ( LAEL starts the machine . The sound of the music is heard . CHARLES 'S cigarette has gone out and is spoiled . He gets a fresh one , tries to light it , fails . LAEL comes over and lights it for him . They hold hands for a moment ) Sorry . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Great day . ( She sits on a hassock at his feet and they listen to the music together , waiting for the drug to take its merciful effect ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( In deep disgust ) Son-of-a-bitch ! LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Yes . ( A pause . He puts his head back ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Oh , Lord  --  the intensity of the beginning and the intensity of the end . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER What ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER And the happiness in between . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Relax , darling . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Get me a drink . LAEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WERTENBAKER I do n't give a damn ! Let 's have it . ( She goes and gets him a drink , making it especially weak : As she does so , the record reaches Baron Ochs 's waltz . He sings along with the record , croakily ) Favorite opera . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER I 'll make it mine . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Everything I have , everything I 've loved , is yours , with all my love . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( Softly ) I 'm thanking you . ( She takes his face between her hands ) For growth and the kids and love . ( He closes his eyes ) And for being so tough  --  such a real pain in the ass , sometimes . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( His eyes pop open ) Me ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( Sitting on the hassock at his knee ) If you had n't been so damned demanding  --  who knows ?  --  certainly I do n't  --  how I 'd have turned out . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Closing his eyes again ) It 's coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He sings , inaccurately ) " That ol ' black magic 's Got me in its spellThat ol ' black magicThat you weave so well  --  " p. 131 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( Rubbing his wrists ) Take it easy . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER I just did n't make it , that 's all . Secret , Lael . Friends may think I would 've if I had n't run out of time  --  but no . Truth is I never would 've made it . Never got to be an artist as a writer  --  too busy being an artist as a liver . No  --  at living . Let 's not mention liver  --  ( He looks about in a daze ) it might be listening ; the bloody , bawdy , villain " Remorseless , lecherous , treacherous , kindless villain ! " LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( Gently ) I 'm here . ( He whistles at her , sharply , and beckons to her . She joins him . He speaks secretively ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER There 's a lot of dirty bastards around . Watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before her holding her head and playing roughly with her hair ) Used to be one myself . Still am , a little . Not so much . Progress ? I do n't know . Takes a lot of energy to be a real bastard . No . No more . Why not ? ( He turns her face to his ) You , I suppose . I hurt people then . Never on purpose , but I did , and I hurt me . Now  --  since  --  I 've hardly hurt anyone . I 've hurt you because I hammered on you some , but that 's all right . You 're better for it If I 'd died in nineteen thirty-eight I 'd have died an utter failure , in love , in work , as a man . I 've got the rest to be thankful for . p. 132 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( Suddenly ) I wo n't know what to do . I 'm afraid ! CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Just do n't panic . Keep on with our gamble as long as you can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back home and go to work when you need to . But I think , if it does n't hurt too much and you do n't need comfort or distraction too badly , if you can  --  though I do n't think I could  --  you should stay here for a year . Then nothing you ever do after ( He throws her aside ) Son-of-a-bitch ! ( He looks around ) Is there anyone else here ? Is there ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER No . ( He looks at her coldly ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER How the hell would you know ? For Christ 's sweet sake  --  you did n't even know what a split infinitive was until I told you  --  and I did tell you . ( At left , CHRIS and MICHEL appear in the workroom . CHRIS carries his binoculars , and he and MICHEL use them to study the countryside and its detail until the end of the scene . CHARLES , suddenly , in a tender tone ) Do the kids know ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER No. p. 133 CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WERTENBAKER In other words , they expect me to recover . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER And so do I.

You heard me , aller et retour . What 're you ? Wise guy ? ( He turns and sees LAEL ) The kids do n't know . Who does ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER The same few . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Tell me . You 've got a list have n't you ? ( Fiercely ) You 've always got a goddam list , have n't you ? ( His blood boils . He comes to her and grasps her , violently ) Have you got a list of all the boyos who 've made it with you ? Big list ? Long list ? Let me see it . Where is it ? Oh , yes , I know you 've told me  --  but you sure you did n't leave one out ? Or two ? Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now or never .

CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER I think Daniel Stein knows . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER He does n't . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Suspiciously ) Then why does he keep calling up all the goddam time ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER To see how you are . p. 135 CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Well , how am I ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How 's Wert ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Much better .

LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Sure . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Okay . I will . You 're sure he 's not dead ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Positive . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Singing ) " Posolutely , Mr. Gallagher Absitively , Mr. Shean ! " ( TIMBERLAKE enters the kitchen and starts to do her homework , with the help of AMA ) LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Sit down . ( He does so and blinks . He comes to ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Do n't blame me . It 's pretty bad . One crise after another . ( He looks at her , his eyes open wide ) I 'm getting anxious about this Dying 's the last thing I 'll have a chance to do well ( He looks straight up ) Damn , I sure could use God right now . ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights it . He takes a first , deep puff  --  blows out the smoke , another puff , another blow . He laughs ) p. 136 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER What ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER I was just thinking I sure fooled hell out of the lung-cancer boys , did n't I ? ( He takes an enormous puff , laughs again , stops , and looks at her soberly ) Glad I made it to Christmas , anyway . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER It 's been a fine one , all things considered . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Important : observe all holidays  --  and teach the kids to , too . Kids to , too ? I need an editor The French know . Holidays . They mean something . They help you to live . They punctuate life . So even if you leave France  --  observe all holidays including Lincoln 's Birthday , Michaelmas and Arbor Day . And make a little fuss on all birthdays , including mine . Do n't try to make up for me not around with the kids . Do n't be a mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is tiring ) You think not , but I hope you do find another man to love and make as happy as you 've made me ; and please know you have my unqualified blessing if you do . ( Unaware that his cigarette is lit , he speaks to her calmly and politely ) May I have a light , please ? ( LAEL comes to him , strikes a match and lights his cigarette . One puff , one blow ) Thank you . ( She turns away . He caresses , then pats her bottom ) Thank you , Miss Wills . ( She looks at him , flushed with mingled emotions . He smiles at her , flirtatiously . The music of Rosenkavalier continues . At center , the lights fade to half , followed by all areas to black . The night sounds become day sounds ) p. 137 p. 138 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO Ciboure . January 2,1955 . Mid-afternoon . The kitchen and the main room are in half-light ; the workroom in full light . MIRENTCHU is in the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room completely LAEL is in the kitchen with AMA , going over accounts . It is cold . The women wear scarves and sweaters . CHARLES is up in the workroom with his guest , DANIEL STEIN . DAN is a vigorous forty-one . He exudes the joy of life and laughs a great deal . His face is ruddy and tanned , as it would normally be in summer . CHARLES is dressed in country clothes , DAN in city clothes . Between them , on the table , is a tray . On the tray , a bottle of Waterfill and Frazier bourbon , and a pitcher of water . They each hold a partly consumed drink . They are in positions of easy , conversational comfort . CHARLES ( Ending an account )  --  so after a while , Wolcott said , " Well , what 's the difference ? They sound the same . " And Ross said , " Goddamit I know they sound the same but so do Pollyanna and Polly Adler ! " ( DAN booms out a laugh while CHARLES finishes his drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last .

( He takes a small sip of his drink ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Drink up , Dan . Time 's a wastin ' . DANIEL STEIN Hold it . I 'm not so sure you 're supposed to be banging on it so hard  --  also , I do n't want to get Lael sore at me for being bad company . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Drink up . DANIEL STEIN Wert . Have a heart . I was brought up in Brooklyn  --  with no alcoholic training . I never had a drink till I was twenty-three . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER You 're way behind . DANIEL STEIN Okay .

( He reads the label ) Waterfill and Frazier . Sounds like a revival team . Moody and Sankey . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER It 's our personal grog . Lael 's sister Julie got a case to us .

DANIEL STEIN That was one hell of a book he threw . I shook for a week . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER I revere it . And him . ( DAN glances at the typewriter ) DANIEL STEIN How 's yours ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Bloodcurdling . ( DAN laughs ) DANIEL STEIN Why does everybody think it 's so easy , what we do ? Try to do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looks easy . p. 141 DANIEL STEIN I 'd rather have my teeth drilled . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Lael 's got a theory . And being a writing woman , she 's entitled to one . She says writing does something to the intestines  --  she does n't pretend to explain it  --  she just says there 's a connection between the typewriter and the gut . DANIEL STEIN She 's right . Hey ! Maybe that 's what happened to your gut . ( A joke ) Writer 's cramp , shall we call it ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Easily ) Would n't be surprised . DANIEL STEIN I do n't mind telling you , Wert  --  you had us all worried there for a while . Flying to New York and all that . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER It was mostly to satisfy Lael . We owe them that , kid . DANIEL STEIN Damn right . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Ruminating ) Everybody should have a brush with it . I recommend it . Makes you realize hard that death 's what makes life rare and valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact of it  --  that 's what gives us the impulse to live while we can . So what the hell 's all this card-playing and time-wasting ? We 've got five senses apiece , right ? You do n't live if you do n't use them . I 'm talking about daily . See , hear . Taste , touch , smell . Been doing much of that lately ? Been getting your share ? p. 142 DANIEL STEIN Truth ? No . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Get with it . ( They drink ) DANIEL STEIN What about you ? How long before full steam ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Who knows ? This may have been a signal . My father knew a lot about that . He was a doctor , y'know . And he once said to me , " You 'll do fine , boy , if you just remember that the forties ai n't the thirties , the fifties ai n't the forties , the sixties ai n't the fifties  --  and so on . " DANIEL STEIN And so on . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER I do n't know . I prolonged my twenties , cut short my thirties  --  my forties ? Yes . I lived in them . ( He takes a long drink ) Too soon yet to tell about my fifties  --  but I 'm working on ' em . As you see . DANIEL STEIN ( Looking at CHARLES 'S typewriter ) You go for that Underwood ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER I do . Sexually . Only time it ever broke down , I took it in my arms and held it on my lap and Lael drove me in to Bayonne . I paced the streets while the guy fixed it . He would n't let me watch . I was sore as hell . p. 143 DANIEL STEIN Ellen bought me an electric . Not used to it yet . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Yuh  --  well , I do n't like a typewriter that 's smarter than I am . DANIEL STEIN And there 's a lot to be said for longhand . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Raising his glass ) To longhand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still got her pink hair ? DANIEL STEIN Pinker . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Suddenly ) Be nice to women . DANIEL STEIN I am . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Fiercely ) Nicer ! ( DAN is taken aback ) DANIEL STEIN Okay , Wert . I will . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Be tender with them and try to understand them more and deeper down . They 're delicate creatures . Exquisite , really . And they 're having a tough time in this century . Just do n't bat them around . DANIEL STEIN What makes you  --  CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Wait a second . ( He sticks a sheet of paper into the machine and types a few lines . He explains ) To remind myself to tell my boy about that . It 's not enough to know about the birds and the bees . p. 144 DANIEL STEIN You 've got to be nice to the birds and , the bees , that it ? ( A change in the atmosphere ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Rather tightly ) You kidding me , pal ? DANIEL STEIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , let 's end it . DANIEL STEIN ( Withdrawing ) Just a crack . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Hotly ) I told you something important . Swallow it . Do n't throw it up . ( The mood passes . He leans forward and touches DAN , in apology ) I 'm on a lot of medication still . Gives me the sudden jumps . But as long as I 've hit a crotchety stretch let me say it . ( He points at him ) And do n't you get sore . DANIEL STEIN I wo n't . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER You do n't work enough . ( A pause ) DANIEL STEIN ( A sore spot touched ) Who does ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER You do n't . You 've done fine work  --  and there 's better in you . Use your time . p. 145 DANIEL STEIN I 'll try . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Watch out for the wild world . It 's a disintegrator . ( He quotes ) " Work strengthens us ; pleasure consumes us ; let us choose ! " New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is enough for stuff like that ( He picks up a book ) This book of mine . Flopped . That 's not the point , though . I wrote it . That is . The belt has to come in the doing , not in what you get out of it later . That 's something else  --  the cherry on the top . Or the horseball . ( He tosses the book aside ) DANIEL STEIN Wert . I love you . Plenty . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Indicating the book ) Did I sound bitter about that bust ? I did n't mean to . DANIEL STEIN No . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER It was the right story in the wrong form . Form , Dan  --  form . That 's your job in life . ( He is aware of his small blunder and makes the correction ) Our job . Life 's a nonsense  --  chaos  --  meaningless . An atomic accident , probably . Until Picasso looks at it . Then something happens . Order and design . A cathedral has it , sometimes . Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure , but not when we start moralizing . We 're not supposed to steer the human race . Do n't police the party , just describe it . That book  --  I kept trying to Say Something . I forgot it 's all been said . This passion to be original . Good God , it 's like looking for a new way to screw . What 's wrong with the old way ? Nothing , if it 's got love in it . And everything if it ain't. p. 146 DANIEL STEIN ( Laughing ) Good ol ' Topic A. Always the best beginning and no better end . ( He glances at his watch ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Carefully ) When can you make it down again , do you think ? DANIEL STEIN In a month . Maybe less . ( He grins ) See , I 'm planning to work a lot more . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Mm-hmm . ( DAN moves out of the room , and stands near the steps . CHARLES joins him ) DANIEL STEIN Wert CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER See you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think I take it lightly , you all the way down here in January . Just to see a pal temporarily on the blink . DANIEL STEIN It was a treat . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Love to Ellen . DANIEL STEIN You bet ( They are looking deep into each other ) And CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Yuh . ( DAN goes . CHARLES leans forward , holding onto his table , hanging his head . He shows the strain of the visit . The lights fade to half and come up full in the main room . LAEL is there . DAN comes in , cheerfully ) p. 147 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Ah . I was two seconds from coming up to get you . Your taxi 's here . DANIEL STEIN Good . ( He picks up a blue , Pan-American flight bag . At left , during the following scene , CHARLES , lowers himself to his chair , slowly . He writes a note , gets an envelope , folds the note into the envelope and seals it . He sticks it into his typewriter , prominently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a small bottle . He opens the bottle and spills its contents onto the tray  --  capsules . He begins to take them . After the fourth , he puts his head on his typewriter and is immobile ) LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Though what I wish you 'd do is send him away and let me drive you to the train . DANIEL STEIN Would n't think of it . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER He 'd like it better . Wert . DANIEL STEIN Yuh  --  well , he ca n't always have his own way  --  the big stiff . ( The locution troubles him , but he presses on ) Anything I can send you ? Or Ellen ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Yes . Send me Ellen . DANIEL STEIN Should I ? ( LAEL , shakes her head ) p. 148 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Well , what do you think of our boy ? DANIEL STEIN ( Enthusiastically ) Great ! ( His knees give way . He drops the bag . His hands cover his face as he breaks down . He sinks into a chair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LAEL watches him , astonished that he apparently knows or has found out . She goes to him , touches him ) Sorry , Lael . I tried to  --  LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Never mind . ( DAN is gaining control , slowly ) DANIEL STEIN I really do apologize . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Have you known for a long time ? ( He nods ) How ? ( He shrugs ) DANIEL STEIN I thought I could handle it and I did , too  --  did n't I ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Fooled me . DANIEL STEIN But Jesus . He 's been saying goodbye to me for an hour . Forever . Trying to leave me the best of himself . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER I know . DANIEL STEIN And nothing to be done ? p. 149 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER We 're doing it . DANIEL STEIN Anywhere in the world ? Anyone ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Not yet , they say . DANIEL STEIN And you . Ca n't you use some help ? Should n't some of us stick around ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER No , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wait who ca n't share in what 's good about it . Neither one of us would trade even these last seven weeks  --  when we 've known that whatever time we had , it was n't much  --  for a whole different lifetime He 's been giving me with both hands  --  strength , wisdom . DANIEL STEIN ( Numbed ) What happened in New York ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER It was too late . Jim told us that the only treatment now around might delay things  --  maybe as much as a year or two  --  but it would mean  --  the treatment and the stretchout  --  suffering . Wert decided to hell with that . DANIEL STEIN Damn if I know what I 'd do . Hang on , I guess . A day at a time . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER What the hell . He 's lived the way he wanted to live . If he were a different kind of man  --  paid attention to his gut  --  aches and drunk barium instead of brandy  --  had himself x-rayed months ago  --  maybe  --  who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the life he 's had has been because he 's the man he was  --  ( A quick correction ) he is . p. 150 DANIEL STEIN The kids ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( Under the spell of her awful slip ) Fine . Pop 's sick  --  but , oh , well  --  somebody 's always sick . Coming back here was the thing to do . This village is warm and simple  --  the best place for it to happen . People take things naturally here , and the days go on . I 'm going to stay  --  afterwards . We 've decided that . Until I learn to be alone You 'll miss your train . DANIEL STEIN I hope I do . Lael  --  call me if  --  well , you know . If . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Sure . DANIEL STEIN And nothing I can do now ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Yes , there is . We need more stuff  --  Dolophine , morphine , Nalline . ( She hands him a piece of paper ) I 've written it down . DANIEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warningly ) It 's not easy . DANIEL STEIN How much ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER As much as you can get wo n't be too much . DANIEL STEIN ( Confidently ) I 'll get it . p. 151 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER I 've exhausted all the sources around here . I 'm in trouble with them , in fact . The authorities are watching now . Sticky . We 've had some help from home and from unexpected places . One rule  --  legitimate sources only . He feels strongly about that . DANIEL STEIN Sure . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Phillipe and Jeanne are coming down next week . If you do manage to find some  --  even a little  --  give it to them . DANIEL STEIN I 'll get it . So long . ( She starts to shake his hand , but he drops his bag and embraces her , powerfully . He goes . She leaves in the opposite direction . The lights shift .

( She shouts again ) Come here ! CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Missed again ? ( She takes his head in her arms ) p. 152 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( In supplication ) Not yet . Please not yet . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Jesus Christ , it takes a lot to kill a man ! LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER What happened ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Passed out on two grains , looks like . That plus the grog . Mistake . Again . I may as well tell you . I 've tried it before . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( Amazed ) What ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Twice . I took a shot of camphor . Did n't work . Just made me hungry . And then , day before yesterday , I spent four , five hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Marquand book ? No go . ( He shakes his head ) There 's always cutting the wrists . I 'd like to put that off as long as I can . Hard on you . ( He looks at her and smiles , wearily ) I better make it soon .

No operation . He does n't want it . You 've suggested it and he 's refused it . ( Warningly , almost threateningly ) Now leave him alone ! ( DR . CARTIER has a temper , too  --  and he shows it now ) p. 156 DR . CARTIER You can not let him refuse ! What a farce ! You 're responsible . You 're the well one . You and I should take him by force if necessary . In an ambulance . To the hospital .

He gets up and walks over to her without his cane , without hesitation , with youth and vigor . What happens now is the phenomenon of perfect , total recall . In takes , the words and actions and attitudes of some of their other time return to be lived again . As it begins , LAEL is uncertain certain as to how to handle it . She decides to go with it in order not to disturb him ) p. 169 CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Hello . You 're Lael Tucker are n't you ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER I 'm Charles Wertenbaker . ( She takes his hand ) LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Not Charles Christian Wertenbaker ! CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER You know me ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Everybody around here knows you . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Grover says you 're one of the bright ones . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER I 'll ask for a raise on that . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER What do you do , mostly ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Oh , I 'm just a demon researcher . I 've handled some of your copy from London . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER How 'd you like it ? ( She smiles ) LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER On the whole , A-1 . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Prompting ) Great punctuator. p. 170 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER You 're a great punctuator . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Say ! Not bad for the history books , eh ? Wertenbaker , the Great Punctuator . ( She laughs ) Come on , I 'll get you a drink . ( They move to another part of the room and sit ) LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER When will you be going back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER I wish I were . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER I do n't know . Pretty noisy over there right now . War . No place for a woman . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER and CHARLES War 's no place for anybody . ( He studies her ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Type ? Shorthand ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER The works . ( He gets up and leaves her . He stands apart . He covers his eyes with his right hand . His hand comes down . He calls her to him . She joins him . He points to the floor ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Here . You are now looking at the most beautiful grass on the face of the earth . Taken the people of Oxford six hundred years to develop it . p. 171 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Worth every penny . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Would you care to sit on the most beautiful grass on the face on the earth ? ( She sits on the floor . He drops down beside her ) I 'm very glad you 're here , Lael . LAEL TUCKER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British  --  right now  --  have you noticed ? They bring out the best in everybody . How come that ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER They set an example . The three weeks I 've been here , I have n't met one who is n't doing something . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER And with such damned heartbreaking good humor . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER I love them . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Yes . And  --  ( He stops . She looks at him , openly . He leans forward and touches his cheek to hers , gently . He takes her hand . He looks at her , kisses her ) LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Oh . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER This all feels blessedly young , my girl . Thank you . ( They smile at each other . He reaches out and touches her breast , and her other breast , with love . He bends and kisses her breasts , in turn . She touches his head in response . He moves her back carefully until she is prone . He sits and looks at her , then stretches out beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The memory of their first love floods them as they exchange a long , passionate , meaningful embrace . Finally , he gets up and moves away . She gets up . She is shaken . He sits on the edge of the bed ) p. 172 CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Sit down , Lael . ( She comes to him ) Now listen . Before I ask you to marry me and before you say yes or no or maybe  --  I want to tell you I 've tried it twice , and failed both times . Both women  --  good ones  --  assure me I 'm a right rough man to live with . I have n't much dough  --  but I could make some , if that 's important to you . The job is steady and the expense account furnishes a little luxe now and then . When this is over , I 'd like to work like hell for a couple of years and save some loot , then go somewhere  --  anywhere  --  you can choose  --  and see if I can produce something more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For instance  --  LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Yes ! CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER What ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER I said yes . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Do n't you want to  --  LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER One of your faults is that you talk too much . You waste time . I 've had a pair of misses , too . But I 'm more than willing to try again  --  if I can try with you . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Please . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER I have some old furniture and a new standard typewriter . No debts . p. 173 CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER An heiress , eh ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER And in spite of the fact that we 're a touch late  --  I want very much to have some kids . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER I ca n't think of anything more important . ( They embrace ) How do you feel ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( In his arms ) Fine . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER No . How do you feel ? ( She frowns hard , trying to remember the correct line . He is impatient and shakes her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It comes ) Scared to death . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Relieved ) That 's it . ( They hold on to each other . The lights fade to half . At right , the lights come up in the kitchen . The phone rings . AMA answers it . The backdrop goes to darker night ) AMA All oui de la part de qui ? . ( She calls into the living room ) Madame ! ( LAEL comes in . AMA indicates the phone ) p. 174 AMA M'sieu Stein . ( At center during the following , CHARLES rises and makes his way back to his armchair . The children , in night clothes , join him , each with a glass of milk ) LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( On the phone ) Oui ? Dan ! How are you ? Yes , they did . A million thanks . It 's doing a great deal for him  --  yes , and for me , too . When ? I do n't know , dear . I 'd better ask him Dan . He 's fading now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Neuilly address Love to Ellen Goodbye , dear . ( She hangs up . The lights go to half , and come up full in the main room ) CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Calling off ) Mom ! Hurry up . ( LAEL comes in ) LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER What 's the excitement ? TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER The surprise . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Only one guess to a customer . TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER Me , first . ( She guesses ) We 're going on a trip . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Wrong ! p. 175 TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER Oh ! CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Taking a turn ) Getting a new car . ( CHARLES teases for a beat , allowing him to think he has guessed it , then speaks ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Like an umpire ) Strike two ! ( They all turn to LAEL ) LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( Guessing ) You 're going to have a baby ! TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER Oh , Mom ! CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER That was last year . No . All wrong . Here it comes . ( He indicates that they are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets up , goes to the back of the area , puts on CHRIS 'S red beret and sash , and picks up his guitar ) Now ! ( They all look at him ) CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Concert ! ( CHARLES tunes the guitar ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER As an acrobat pal of mine used to say : " This is a great trick if I do it ! " ( They settle down to listen . The mood changes . CHARLES is all at once serious and sober . He wipes his hands , mops his brow , takes a very deep breath and begins . He plays a chorus of " Sol y Sombra "  --  perfectly , with technical dexterity and musical feeling . The tempo is , if anything , a shade too fast . TIMBERLAKE , a surprise-lover , watches with interested joy ; CHRIS is amazed , and waits for the errors which do not come ; LAEL senses the climax involved and is terrified . The performance ends . Applause : wild , from TIMBERLAKE ; grudging , from CHRIS ; mechanical , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be damned ! Not one mistake ! Not one ! CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Cockily ) That 's all , folks ! TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER Great surprise , Pop . The best one this week ; is there one for tomorrow ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER You bet . ( The kids come to him and say goodnight . The kisses are perfunctory . LAEL looks at CHARLES with concern . He reassures her with a wink and a smile . She takes the children off . As they clear the area , CHARLES starts for his bed . He does not make it . His knees buckle . He hits the floor , lies there for a moment , tries to get up , fails . He drags himself laboriously to the bed . He manages to pull himself up and sit on its edge . He falls off again . After a struggle , he regains his position . He reaches out and gets a handful of pills , which he swallows . LAEL returns ) LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Are you all right ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Hoarsely ) No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Darling . What can I do ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Nothing for a minute . Talk to me . ( He bends over ) p. 177 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Dan phoned a while ago . He wants to come down . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER I guess not . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER I said that . CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER What 's the time ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Eleven twenty . ( An important pause . They can hear each other breathing ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Lael ! ( Something in his voice makes her hesitate before replying ) LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( Finally , in fear ) Yes ? CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Get me my razor and help me . Time 's come LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Wert ( Moving with an air of unreality , she brings him his Rolls razor in its case ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER And please , do n't let me bitch it up this time . Fact is , I 'm out of gas . But I 'm damned glad I did n't take that stupid swim in September . I want you to know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table and places the bowl at his feet ) p. 178 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Tell me what to do . ( His back is seen , and her face , watching ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Get the blade out . ( She does so and hands him the blade ) Darling . Believe me . I ca n't help it . Look away . ( He cuts . He goes in again . The other wrist now . He drops the blade into the bowl and holds his hands over it ) What I feel mostly now is relief . Thank you , love . And for everything If this fails  --  oh , Christ . Help me . ( He leans forward , seems about to fall over . She holds him , helping him . Now , for the first time  --  he weeps ) Sooner sooner Octopus Goddam thing 's fighting back ! It does n't want to go  --  but , oh , how I do ! ( A pause . He is breathing heavily . A moan escapes him ) LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( Holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( He trembles . A single spasm . Silence ) CHARLES CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER I love you , my  --  ( A final spasm . He has won . He becomes wax and bones in her arms . She lets him lie back , slowly . The weight of his body pulls her atop him . She disengages herself , slowly , as the lights fade to half . All areas go to black ) p. 179 Act 2 , Scene 5 SCENE FIVE Ciboure . January 15 , 1955 . Morning . The main room has been restored to its former character . At the right ; in the kitchen , all goes on as before . At the left , the workroom is changed about . LAEL 's yellow cardigan is draped over the chair . There are flowers in a vase on the table . The table is piled with letters and telegrams in wire baskets . At center , LAEL , TIMBERLAKE , and CHRIS are at breakfast . CHRIS plays with the Slinky throughout the scene . The phonograph is playing Rosenkavalier , softly . TIMBERLAKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Maybe . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Even Thursday ? When no school ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER We 'll see . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Are you still answering letters ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Yes . TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER Will they keep coming forever ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER I doubt it . TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER May I have some more cream , please ? p. 180 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER There you are . ( She passes the cream ) CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Seriously ) Mom . About Pop 's suits . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Yes . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER I have thought it over . And I would like to have them cut down for me . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER All right . That man in San Sebastian is awfully good . At least Pop thought so , and he certainly was a snappy dresser . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER But he did n't  --  the man in San Sebastian  --  make them to begin with , did he ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER I think one he did . That brown tweed jacket . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Yeah . That 's gon na look good on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get anything . ( LAEL looks at her . The phonograph breaks down in its habitual way slowing to a croaking noise . They all look at it ) Uh  --  uh ! LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Well , that 's that . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Nobody can fix ' er now . Pop could . Nobody else . ( Still , he goes to the machine and putters with it . A sound escapes TIMBERLAKE-full of despair and loneliness and aching ) p. 181 TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER Oh , Pop ! ( A pause ) LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER ( To TIMBERLAKE ) Missy ? How about our baking a fine pecan pie this afternoon ? CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Great idea ! TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER ( To CHRIS ) Why do n't you bake it then ? CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Because I 'm a male ! TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER Chefs are male ! CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Mailmen are male . So what ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER All right , that 's enough . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER She gets me . ( He has been working over the machine . It makes noises , but no music . He gives up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table ) Mom ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Yes . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Remember Ama 's father ? Old man Gelos ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Of course . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER He was just about my oldest man I ever saw . Was he yours ? p. 182 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER He was old , all right . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER How old ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER I 'm not sure . They all said ninety-seven , but I do n't see how they could have known . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER He was funny , all right . So mad at everybody all the time . And he used to fall down . TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER ( Eating ) Pop 'll never be old now , will he ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER No . TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER ( Cheerfully ) Well , that 's one good thing , anyway . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Can shirts be cut down ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Yes , but not sweaters . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER And not shoes . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER No . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER What 'll we do with those ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Give them away . TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and begins smelling his salad , noisily ) p. 183 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER What 's the matter ? CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Easily ) Nothing . I just realized I have n't smelled anything yet today . Pop made me promise I 'd use every one of my five senses  --  hard  --  every day . TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER I 've got five senses , too . ( She begins smelling her food . A pause , as they all eat ) CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER And I 'm supposed to think for at least an hour every day . Just plain think . TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER I hate thinking . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( To LAEL ) About this next year . Then after are we surely going back to the States ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Why do n't we wait and see ? TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER I think we should stay here  --  where Pop is . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Ho-ly cow ! Is she going to have a vote , too ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Of course . TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER I 'm going back to going to be a ballet dancer , okay ? ( A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble ? TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER What 's that ? CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Are we , Mom ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER No , of course not . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER What if we get to be in money trouble ? LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Well , your Grandpa Tucker used to have a saying : " When you 're broke , get a job ! " CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER That 'd be keen ! LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Or we could always sell Timberlake . ( CHRIS and LAEL look at her . She looks from one to the other ) TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER ( Calmly ) Ha ha . ( Inexplicably , the phonograph comes on again , powerfully , playing Baron Ochs 's waltz . It startles them into laughter . They watch the machine for a moment ) CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Philosophically ) It wo n't last . Nothing does . LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Lots of things do . CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER Like what ? p. 185 LAEL TUCKER WERTENBAKER Think . ( He thinks . TIMBERLAKE breaks the silence with a giggle . LAEL looks at her ) TIMBERLAKE WERTENBAKER ( Repeating , with remembered joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly sober . She eats ) CHRISTIAN WERTENBAKER ( Looking off ) Yuh . He was okay . ( They all put their attention on the phonograph , hearing the music and seeing the images which it evokes . There is a pause )
