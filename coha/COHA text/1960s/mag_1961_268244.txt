" For contributions to nuclear and theoretical physics , to peaceful uses of atomic energy , and to the security of the U.S. , " the Atomic Energy Commission last week gave its Enrico Fermi Award ( gold medal and $50,000 ) to Physicist Hans Albrecht Bethe of Cornell . Both the honor and the honorarium were deserved ; seldom has an immigrant done more for his adopted country . <P> Part of Nazi Germany 's precious , albeit unintentional , scientific legacy to the U.S. , Hans Bethe was born in 1906 in Alsace and educated in German universities . When Hitler came to power in 1933 , he was dismissed from his post as assistant professor of physics at the University of Tubingen ( his mother was Jewish ) and went to England . In 1935 he came to Cornell , where he has been a full professor since 1937 . <P> Before the start of World War II , Bethe was one of the few men in the U.S. , or anywhere else , who understood the infinite implications of nuclear physics . His interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an explanation of the thermonuclear reactions from which the sun and the stars get their energy . When war started , he was soon in the thick of the scientific battle . He served first at M.I.T. 's Radiation Laboratory , then went to Los Alamos to head the theoretical physics division of the atom bomb project . Had Hitler 's empire lasted a little longer , the bomb that Bethe helped build at Los Alamos might well have blown his homeland apart . <P> Since the war , Bethe has had little time for his work at Cornell . Trusted by Presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to Jack Kennedy for his dispassionate scientific judgment , he is constantly called on for advice on everything from missile nose cones to nuclear testing . He is no propagandist , nor does he see nuclear-age problems in black and white . He is deeply worried about the doomsday peril of nuclear warfare , but he does not let this emotion-charged subject , about which many scientists are bitterly partisan , drive him to stubborn extremes . In judging nuclear test ban treaties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he still hopes that the nuclear nations can come to agreement before it is too late . Far more than the award citation could spell out , Hans Bethe continues to contribute " to the security of the U.S. " <P> Award giving and getting is of swiftly increasing importance in U.S. science . Until a decade ago , the Swedish Nobel Prizes ( 1960 value : $43,627 ) were almost alone in their class . They still have the most prestige , but other prizes are richer . The Ford Atoms for Peace Award brings $75,000 ( latest winner Sir John Cockcroft ) . Next comes the $50,000 Enrico Fermi Award . And to raise the ante , all bona fide prize money , except when given by a company to an employee , is tax free .
