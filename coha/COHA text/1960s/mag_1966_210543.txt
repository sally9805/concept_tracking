The people who specialize in assessing the actions of Fidel Castro are quite aptly called Castrologists , for on the basis of their past record their chief tool seems to be stargazing . Last week they looked up from their horoscopes again to proclaim that Fidel 's future looked dim . The reason : for the past seven weeks he had not been acting as they thought he should be acting . <P> Not since May Day had he given a major speech . He had not taken visible leadership of last month 's Guantnamo crisis ; admittedly , he had signed the communiqu charging that the U.S. was planning an invasion , but he left it to his brother Raul to preside at the funeral of a Cuban soldier killed in a shooting in cident on the Guantanamo border . And where was Fidel , an inveterate hurricane chaser , when Hurricane Alma hit the island ? There was no evidence that he was even near the disaster areas ( nor was there evidence that he was not ) . Furthermore , it was President Osvaldo Dortics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Dorticos again who presided over a joint meeting of the Cabinet , party chiefs , and farm and labor leaders . <P> What did it all mean ? One theory was that Fidel was ailing ; another that he was undergoing shock treatments . Still another , more widely subscribed to , was that Moscow had finally decided to put Fidel down and replace him with a less mercurial leader such as Dorticos . Were the Castrologists really on to something this time ? Perhaps they were , but only astrologists would know .
