What will most likely be the third biggest city in the world 20 years from now ? Wrong . Not London , not Los Angeles , not Peking-but Sao Paulo , topped only by Tokyo and New York . Gaining some 300,000 new settlers every year , Brazil 's Sao Paulo is the world s fastest-growing city and , with 5,430,000 inhabitants , is now the world 's eighth largest . This week at long last , Sao Paulo could display an art museum worthy of its growing stature . <P> The museum and the rich collection it houses are the almost single-handed achievements of one man-Sao Paulo 's Francisco de Assis Chateaubriand ( " Chat " ) Bandeira de Mello , a short stout press lord with a considerable resemblance to New York 's late Fiorello <P> La Guardia in both appearance and personality . In 1947 , noting that Sao Paulo ( and indeed all Brazil ) was sadly deficient in art , he proclaimed , " A nation without art is backward and barbaric , " and set out to remedy this defect . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his artistic guide and installed him also as director of the Sao Paulo Art Museum-then a museum in name only , except in Chat 's imagination . As chief of some 30-odd newspapers , 19 magazines , 22 radio and 15 TV stations . Chat had plenty of money of his own . But not even that kind of tycoon can command enough millions to assemble an art collection of the scope Chat had in mind . So Chat did not scruple to use his press facilities to extract a little something extra . A businessman , bank or civic organization that coughed up the cash for a work he had his eye on , could count on being eulogized in his publications . Anyone who balked might find himself attacked ( as was one industrialist ) as " a bandit , pachyderm , hippopotamus , Berber filibuster , Barbary pirate . " <P> Chat himself was more pirate than pachyderm . He loved to swoop down on an Old Master for sale on the New York art market and carry it off before slow-moving U.S. museums could get their boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boast that he once snapped up 33 pictures at the Wildenstein Gallery before lunch , then talked the Brazilian government into giving him a $3,000,000 loan to finance his purchases . As the " museum " grew , it was moved from one makeshift quarters to another . In recent years , it has been housed in Chateaubriand 's office building in downtown Sao Paulo . But the city fathers were finally stirred into action , put up the millions to build the collection a home of its own . Its official opening on March 12 will come just a year after Chateaubriand 's death . <P> Designed by Architect Lina Bo ( who is Director Bardi 's ex-wife ) , the building is in effect a box suspended from four giant concrete piles spanned by huge concrete beams . This construction allows for column-free interiors where the paintings are supported in airy space on what amounts to a series of transparent plastic easels.
