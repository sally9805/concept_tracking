It was said of Zeuxis , the great artist of ancient Greece , that he could paint a bunch of grapes so realistically that birds would try to eat them . This was an impressive skill , but art has long since aspired to more than carbpn-copy realism . <P> Now a segment of the advance guard has suddenly pulled a switch . Unknown to one another , a group of painters have come to the common conclusion that the most banal and even vulgar trappings of modern civilization can , when transposed literally to convas , becomes Art . <P> PAINTER WAYNE THIEBAUD , 41 , who teaches at the Davis campus of the University of California , paints cakes , pies , ice-cream cones , candy machines and lollipops , and he portrays them so lushly that the viewer 's mouth is bound to water . Last week , as his first Manhattan show closed at the Allan Stone Gallery , there was ample evidence that he had a number of connoisseurs drooling as sympathetically over the slice-of-cake school of art as literary critics once took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's canvases : Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art . Hartford 's Wadsworth Atheneum . Collector James Thrall Soby , Architect Philip Johnson . <P> Thiebaud , like any traditional painter became interested in how light affected objects , particulary the garnish glare of bulbs and florescent tubes that made objects seem to swell with importance . When be drove across the country , he noticed soemthing else ; the repetition of " the still life of the restaurant table " - the same salt and pepper shakers and napkin holders in dining rooms and roadside stands everywhere . Finally , after a trip to Mexico he found that what struck him most vividly on re-entering the U.S. was the gaudy luxury of the drugstore and hamburger stands . And so he began painting food , " Meringue is a beautiful substance , " he says , " but there also is a connection with the quality of the paint , the luscious , fatty richness of oil paint and the greasiness of meats and buttery frostings . This is a still-life area we have a tendency to take for granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park , N.J. , started his fine-arts career painting semi-abstract versions of Remington 's cowboys and Indians , and later began to conceal comic-strip cartoon characters inside abstract-expressionist paintings . " This led me to wonder what it would be like if I made a cartoon that looked like a cartoon . " In addition to cartoons-on-canvas , he began painting household objects-trash cans , washing machines , light cords-in the same flat technique . " I try to use what is a cliche -a powerful clich-and put it into organized form , " he says . By presenting common things , familiar to commercial art , in a different context , Lichtenstein , a onetime window-dresser , argues that he is creating something new . " It brings up the question ' What is art ? ' " says he .
