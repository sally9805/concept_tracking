Clad in combat fatigues , with a dagger and a revolver buckled to his waist , Major General Olinto M. Barsanti marched up to General William C. Westmoreland at Bien Hoa airbase northeast of Saigon and declared : " The 101st Airborne Division is present for combat in Viet Nam . " Arrival of the fresh troops last week marked a new and potentially crucial phase in the war . Westmoreland believes that allied troops have succeeded during 21 years of fighting in pushing the main body of Communist regulars to South Viet Nam 's frontiers . Now , in response to the enemy 's delaying action there , he has launched a new strategy of border battles aimed at keeping the large , organized units of invaders out of South Viet Nam . <P> The addition of 7,000 Screaming Eagle paratroopers was accomplished during a month-long secret airlift , largest of its kind during any war , and boosted U.S. strength to 477,200-topping the peak American force of 472,800 in Korea . More G.I.s are on the way , as Westmoreland presses to achieve a total force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several months ahead of schedule in order to press his new offensive . <P> Optimism &; Perplexity . In the past two months , the Communists have also adopted a new strategy , but with such disastrous results that cautious U.S. field commanders are torn between optimism and perplexity . Since last October , when North Vietnamese regulars launched the war 's most inept attack at Loc Ninh , losing 926 dead to 50 , enemy forces have repeatedly hurled themselves against heavily fortified positions from their frontier redoubts . <P> Their losses have been large . In clashes last week alone , the Communists lost 54 dead at Gio Linh near the Demilitarized Zone in the northern province of Quang Tri , 56 near Danang , 471 at Bong Son in the center of the country along the coast , 143 north of Saigon , 39 northwest of the capital , and 501 in the Mekong Delta in the south . In all , 65 Americans and 78 South Vietnamese died in the battles . Meanwhile , Ho 's homeland was heavily pounded last week by U.S. fighter-bombers . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , American jets blasted downtown bridges and railyards in both Hanoi and Haiphong for three straight days . <P> " Attack &; Attack ! " The Communist tactics puzzle U.S. strategists , who wonder how long the North can sustain them . Says one high officer : " In our terms we would call it desperate , but I give the Communists far more credit in their planning and thinking than to tag their actions as desperate . " In the past , enemy units have refrained from attacking until they had spent weeks planning the battle and scouting the fortifications , and then they took the initiative only when they had a fair chance of winning . Now all that has changed . Documents captured after one battle detailed orders to " attack and continue to attack " and score a " quick victory " even if it meant fighting " to the last man . " <P> " They really do n't like these sharp actions like Dak To , " says one American general . " They prefer the drip , drip , drip of so many American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have both the drip , drip , drip and the sharp actions . "
