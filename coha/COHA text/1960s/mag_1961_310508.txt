" I 've been a Democrat all my life , " wrote an angry Army reservist to his Congressman , " but I led the booing when Kennedy 's picture came on the newsreel . " Last week other Congressmen were receiving scores of similar letters , and newspapers across the U.S. bloomed with headlines about the unhappy lot of reservists and National Guardsmen who have been recalled to active duty since the Berlin crisis began boiling . What was going on ? The answer : nothing more snafu than usual in times of rapid military buildup . <P> Last summer , when Russia began to threaten war over Berlin , the Kennedy Administration decided that there was no time to beef up the armed forces with a draft or a recruiting campaign , turned instead to the reserves and the National Guard as the only available source of trained manpower . Since then , the Army has called up 119,000 men , the Navy 8,000 , and the Air Force 28,000 . The Air Force and the Navy have had relatively few gripes , mostly because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-trained units that needed little preparation for combat . <P> Falling Back on the Fillers . But the Army was different . Reserve units averaged only 61% of authorized combat strength , National Guard units 70% . To bring recalled reserve and National Guard outfits up to snuff , the Army had to fall back on some 40,000 " fillers " - stand- by reservists , who belonged to no particular unit and did not really think that they would ever be summoned short of actual war . From the fillers have come most of the squawks about the recall system . Of the 17,000 Army reservists ' applications for deferment , fully 80% have come from the fillers . <P> <P> When the fillers reach camp , they get even unhappier . The Army , after dislocating their lives , seems unprepared to get them back into uniform-if a uniform is to be had . Last week at Fort Lewis , Wash. , a filler wearing slacks and a black jacket complained : " I 've been here since Nov. 3 , and I do n't have a uniform yet . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just do n't have it . " <P> Indeed , the Army has not had on hand the materiel to equip many of the recalled reservists . The lack of sheets , field jackets and cutlery touched off a rash of complaints . Asked Pfc . Jack Powell in Fort Polk , La. : " Have you ever tried to eat your corn flakes with a fork ? " Wisconsin 's Republican Congressman Alvin E. O'Konski charged that the 32nd Infantry Division of Wisconsin 's National Guard had been mobilized at Fort Lewis without adequate food , clothing , bedding and fuel . Cried O'Konski : " The gallant 32nd has been betrayed and demoralized . " In fact , most men of the crack 32nd were embarrassed by O'Konski 's bleats , which had resulted in Fort Lewis career men calling the outfit the " crybaby division . " <P> Little on the Shelf . By far the most legitimate complaint was the Army 's lack of weapons and heavy equipment needed to bring reserve units up to fighting strength . As an example , the 15 2nd Medical Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its authorized HUiA helicopters , is trying to make do with a pair of less adaptable H-igs.
