The saddest thing about the ruckus raised by Tommie Smith and John Carlos was that it dulled the lustre of a superlative track and field meet in which the U.S. once again demonstrated that it is the world 's best . The Star-Spangled Banner was played so often that it began to sound like The Stars and Stripes Forever . <P> As they kept the band working , Americans set record after record . Texas ' strapping Randy Matson won the shotput and set an Olympic record of 67 ft. 10 in. ; California 's Bob Seagren soared to another new Olympic mark by clearing 17 ft. 8 in. in the pole vault . In the short dashes , California 's Jim Hines clocked 9.9 sec. in the men 's 100 meters to tie his own pending world record , and Georgia 's Wyomia Tyus won the women 's 100 in 11 sec. flat . Then , in the field events , there was Al Oerter 's fourth straight discus victory and Bob Beamon 's incredible long jump ( see box ) . <P> Swimming and diving were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three events had been held , and Americans had won all three-two of them , the men 's 400-meter freestyle relay and the women 's 400-meter medley relay , in world-record times . The U.S. basketball team was still unbeaten , heading for a showdown with the Soviet Union . But there are 19 sports in the 1968 Olympics-more than enough to give athletes from the rest of the world an opportunity to make their marks . And they did . Four of the best so far : <P> &gt; Russia 's Victor Kurentsov , 27 , a blond Soviet Army lieutenant who has been working out with weights since he was nine years old , set an Olympic record in the press by lifting 336 Ibs . He followed that with a world record of 413 Ibs. in the clean and jerk to win the middleweight championship . <P> &gt; Sweden 's Bjoern Perm , 24 , a 5-ft. 11-in. , 159-lb. university student from Stockholm , rode , fenced , shot , swam and ran his way to victory in the modern pentathlon , a quasi-military test of skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanding than the decathlon . After four days of brutal competition , Perm ran 4,000 meters across country in 14 min. 25.7 sec. to edge Hungary 's Andras Balczo for the gold medal by the thin margin of 11 points . <P> &gt; France 's Pierre Trentin , 24 , a leatherworker from Crteil , a Paris suburb , was given " not a chance " to win the 1,000-meter cycling race by his own nation 's sports newspaper , L'Equipe . From a standing start , he pedaled the distance in 1 min. 3.91 sec. - averaging 35 m.p.h. - to earn himself both the gold medal and a world record . <P> &gt; Poland 's Jerzy Pawlowski , 35 , for all his slight stature and bald head , came to Mexico City as a latter-day D'Artagnan : in three previous Olympics he had won three silver medals in fencing and one bronze . This time he took a gold medal , winning 18 out of 20 bouts and the individual saber championship .                  @ @ @
