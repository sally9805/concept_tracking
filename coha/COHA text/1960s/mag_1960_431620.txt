 | THe Library 's New Role As I lock the door of the library on this , the thirteenth anniversary of the day I came to work here , I think of the changes that have taken place in the library , the town , and in me during these years . outside , the library does not appear to have changed much , although this coat of paint on the door is one of several that have worn out . The landscaping is new , the bicycle racks are out- ? grown again , and the universal parking problem has moved to this block too . . Inside , however the library has changed . The crowded children 's room has been converted into a work-storage room , and the present children 's room , with its bright tile floor and new stacks , is across the hall in the room formerly used for the auditorium . Weekly story hours and an exciting vacation reading program are held in this new area . We are equipped with a record collection now and a record player for background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is available for rental by our patrons . We have some of the same old books and many new ones . We have some of the same borrowers that I met the first day I came to work and many new ones . We have had others who moved into our community briefly and then moved on . We are reading some of the same kind of books , but also new kinds , as the interest of the community changes . Discovery of oil in the area changed the reading , thinking , and economy of the community for a while . When the discovery proved to be a minor one , some of our interest in it lagged . Television came and , after a brief monopoly , began to arouse reading interest in new fields . Children we knew at first in high school have been away to college , married , and now bring their children to the library . It is fun to introduce books to the second generation . Sometimes we think we have done too good a job in interesting young people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to pick up her daughter , who was working on her term paper , " I never thought the library would be the place for high school kids to get together . It 's wonderful . " Some of our readers , disturbed by the confusion and crowding which results from this patronage , do not agree . But they do agree with me that we need more room . Through the years we have seen changes in the kind of reading required by the students and changes in the hours when they need the library most . Split shifts in the schools bring the afterschool rush much earlier in the day . Changes in personnel in the schools bring new demands . Whereas the history classes once read biography extensively , now the socio-economic aspect of history is most popular . Shakespeare and the Globe Theatre get a workout from the students of one English teacher each year , while another changes her emphasis frequently , and we must remember to check with her each semester to see what her students will be looking for . What seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly disappears from the shelves for another assignment . Happily , we have splendid interlibrary loan relations with the State Library Commission , so we are able to supplement our waning supply in a hurry . But all these changes , however interesting from @#  | an administrative view , are not so exciting as the people who use our library . There is one patron who will not read a mystery story set in England . On those rare occasions when she is persuaded to try one and then , amazingly , likes it , we consider it a major victory . There is the teacher who , with her family , visits the library several times each week , and together they read almost everything . They talk about the good books , too , and her students and her children 's friends ask for them . There are the people with special interests for whom We never have enough new books ? the rock hounds , thee art guild , the coin club , and the nature club . All of them add a challenge and a reward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , memories of two families stand out . They are ideal library users . One of them stopped in our town all too briefly . The father is a science teacher and was at our college . He was interested in books and magazines in his field , but also in travel books , modern novels , and many other types of literature . His wife , who is an art teacher and an artist in pottery , enameling , and oil , did much to start the first exhibits in the library . But most exciting of all was the task of finding reading material for their son . When he first began to . visit the library ? a quiet , serious little fellow with bright eyes and a delightful smile ? we had a pet chipmunk , and Gregg 's first act upofi arriving was to feed Scatter . Then , every other week he checked out Charlotte 's Web . This was his favorite book . His parents read to him , of course , and we knew they were kindred spirits when they enjoyed Charlotte as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went directly to the shelf for it almost every time he came in . His little sister was too small for books when the family was here , and they have gone on now to better opportunities in teaching , but a recent letter tells us that they love books more than ever , and no doubt they are as great a joy to their present librarian as they were to me . Our other favorite library family shares our hopes and plans , and we share theirs . When they came to town , the daughter was a fifth grader . Together we lived through her horse phase and her science-fiction phase , and we rejoiced together as she developed into an omnivorous reader with wide interests . We were not surprised that she won a scholarship to a large Eastern school . Now we look forward to her vacations , when she tells us of the exciting intellectual challenges she has there . We also welcome her to the library in the summer , because she helps us with various illpaid but necessary projects , to which she contributes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started kindergarten the same year his sister started college . Maybe he is even more fun . We watched him become a library user . His sister could hardly wait to show him the wonder of the books she had known as a child , and she was very successful in her efforts to interest him in them . Great discussions took place about when to read him this book or that . Was he too young for this ? How would he feel about The Long Winter now ? Probably the most serious problem was when he should have The Wind in the Willows . Extensive post-mortems have forced us to decide that April had heard it when she was too young . Her mother could not wait to share it with her . As a consequence , she is one who may yet grow into it . She must , regretfully , be likened to the young woman whose letters ( according to A. A. Milne ) would have to be returned because of her failure to communicate with Kenneth Grahame . So we tried Trent cautiously with Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he learned to read for himself , and the discovery of the reading process was a great thing in his life . " Mother , " he said , " here is a word I 've learned . " " Yes , and you know this one too . " " Oh , yes , I know that one , but I 've learned this one . " Of course , the parents of such children would have to be charming too . Their house is full of books on every subject from literary criticism to fossil hunting . They use our records and make valuable suggestions for purchases to enhance our collection . They know and worry with us about the library 's problems ? the budget , the need for more room . In short they are real friends of the library . Obviously , these people I have mentioned are personal friends of mine too , as they would be the friends of any librarian . Gregg 's family and Trent 's family are people you like the first time you meet them , and as time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried world . They have time to read , to live , to teach their children the values to be found in books and the great enjoyment to be derived from them . Wherever they are , they are good library families . But what about the people I do n't know so well ? In our community-we have four kinds of people . First , in terms of age , there are those who came to ' this country in the days of early settlement , the late 1880s . These people talk about the hardships of early ranching years before this valley became a checkerboard of irrigated farms . Since my grandfather was one of them , I listen to their stories with interest as we select their books . Perhaps today they will take a Western novel , or maybe they are in the mood for Mari Sandoz 's Old Jules , or The Cattlemen.  | We talk about the range cattle , still going through here when the first settlers came ; the cattle and sheep wars , when Tom Horn terrorized western Nebraska as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of this town . We are all bothered by the fact that soon these stories are going to be forgotten , and if they are not written down , one primary source of the history of the West will be lost . These people , along with their descendants , make up the bulk of our community . Nextare the German-Russian farmers , who were attracted to our area in large numbers by the kind of agriculture with which they were familiar ? the cultivation of sugar beets . They progressed from hired-hand labor to tenant farming . Now they are the owners and operators of the rich farms surrounding our town , where many crops besides sugar beets are grown . Books on the latest agricultural methods are useful to them , but in many cases the experiments are done here and the books are written after the farming improvements have been adopted by the farmers . The library has a deeper obligation to these people than furnishing the latest books on their business , and it is an obligation we neglected thirty years ago . Today we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people as well as to the high school students learning German under the new science-propelled program . But we should have had these books for their pleasure years ago . Now many of their colorful Old World customs have been lost , and the best we can do is to suggest to them books for the complete integration of their culture with ours . Our Spanish-Americans fare slightly better , only because they are more recent arrivals , and we accept them as a different but valuable contribution to our community . We attend their Mexican dinners and watch their folk dances with enjoyment . We have Spanish books for their older readers ; two of their girls work at our library ; and we are aware that their soft , south-of-the- border culture warms our sterner northern reality . We are especially fond of Francisco , who came to this country when he was twelve from a rural area of Mexico . He had never been to school . By the time he was seventeen he had completed grade school and now , two years later , he is finishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time . He endeared himself to us by coming especially to ask for instruction in the use of the library . It was impossible to fit the orientation course in college into his busy schedule , so we gave him private instruction , which he puts to very good use . He is self-reliant and rarely has to appeal to us for help in finding material for his needs . He is losing some of his accent now , but I am sure that he will always retain his gentle , polite manner of speaking and that the sparkle in his dark eyes is here to stay . We look forward to the day when he can read for fun . He is so busy studying now that he has little time for anything else , but maybe next summer . . . . Our other large group of citizens were really here before anyone else . The Pine Ridge Reservation is only 150 miles from our town , so we have many transient Sioux Indians as well as permanent residents who have found a place in this community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our schools , and we are happy when Mr. King , the president of the Platte Valley Indian Council , comes in to read the new books about his people . He uses the legends and stories in some of our collections to refresh his memory for the talks he gives each time the council dances . Everyone enjoys these dances , spectators and dancers alike , and we are happy when it is time for the round dance or the " rabbit dance , " when nonIndians are invited to share in the fun . These are the people who have made our community . They arethe people who run our businesses , our farms , and our town . They are the teachers and the students in our schools , the members of our churches and clubs . They are the people who have worked with me to help the library progress .
