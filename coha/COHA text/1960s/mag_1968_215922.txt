The opening reception at Dsseldorf 's glossy new Kunsthalle was mobbed by Ruhr Valley heiresses , bearded intellectuals , and art dealers from all over Europe . In the crush , nearly everyone failed to recognize the artist , Gnter Haese , 43 , a slender , shy man with an assembly-line haircut and an inexpensive suit . No one , however , could ignore the 27 works on display . Built of watch springs , mesh , tiny cogs and spirals , the small , precisely balanced wire constructions fluttered and danced at the slightest breath . Bearing cryptic names , such as Hermit , Flirt and L ' tat c'est moi , they represented virtually all of Haese 's sculptural output . <P> In the seven years since he first began soldering his elfin evocations of the machine age , Gnter Haese has become one of West Germany 's best-known artists . Critics rave about his " artistic equilibrium , " trace his lineage to Paul Klee , and dub him " the juggler of modern art .

Last month his open cube of wire-works and quivering copper balls , Olymp , became one of the four purchase awards winners at the Guggenheim 's international exhibition of sculpture in New York . <P> Haese 's rise to fame is all the more surprising because he so sedulously refuses to court it .

Today he , his wife , his nine-year-old son and their uncaged parakeet live in a Dsseldorf public housing project . Haese insists on keeping the apartment so clean that the entire family removes its shoes before entering . Despite many tempting offers , Haese sells only enough works to support himself , asks : " Why should I have a lot of money ? What would I do with it ? Pay high taxes ? We are happy this way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delights of caviar or champagne . " It would-only disturb our equilibrium , " explains the juggler of modern art .
