THE NEW REPUBLIC Correspondence Negroes and Politics Sirs : . . . How in Heaven 's name did Kopkind ( Nov. 27 ) come to conclude that Negroes compose half the population of this state ! And how did your editors ever allow such a statement to reach print ! Negroes at present compose no more than 28 percent of Alabama 's population , and this is a dwindling percentage . In no statewide election , in no urban area , can Negroes ever hope to cast more than a fourth of the votes . In only five of 67 counties are there more Negroes than whites ; and in 5o counties , including most of the ones that are growing , Negroes can cast no more than one-fifth to one-tenth of the votes . How did Mr. Kopkind fail to hear the commonest saying in Alabama : " For 3o years we have been swappin ' niggers for Yankees ? " There has been an exodus : it is continuing : and unless a reporter understands all the effects of this exodus , he can not report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are such a minority , and will become a smaller minority , to be effective they must skillfully practice " minority " politics . No political move by them makes sense unless it aims at alliance with at least a third of the white voters . And indeed this is the strategy proposed by Tuskegee 's Dr. C. G. Gomillion and by Huntsville 's Dr. John L. Cashin , Jr . It is the strategy being followed by NAACP , as well as by Dr. King 's Southern Christian Leadership Conference . The only two groups now working for white man-black man division in Alabama are the supporters of George Wallace and the SNCC workers . The Wallace supporters are White Supremacists ; the SNCC workers are well-intentioned but foolish . Mr. Kopkind writes : " With about ioo more workers , and perhaps $40,000 , SNCC could revolutionize Alabama politics in six months . " This is a ridiculous statement , to be expected from a reporter who begins by assuming that half the potential voters in Alabama are Negroes . He writes further : " The Negroes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can do with their numerical superiority . " The Negroes in the 17 Black Belt counties do not have any " numerical superiority . " The five counties in which Negroes do have numerical superiority have been tied to " white " counties to form legislative districts with white majorities . So if Negroes attempt any mass takeover of county offices , they will only invite white retaliation in their legislative district . Or in the state-wide races . Moreover , what sort of Negroes remain in the Black Belt ? During a 3o-year exodus to better jobs , to a hoped-for better way of life , what sort of people have chosen to stay ? Obviously the unambitious , the untrained , the people most inclined toward " staying in their place . " This is why the " middle-class Negroes , " for whom Mr. Kopkind seems to feel contempt , fear any precipitate , Congo-like , SNCC-inspired " take-over " by uneducated Negroes in the five counties where this might be possible . . . . William Bradford Huie Hartselle , Alabama In reply . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power in Alabama is not based on arithmetic but on political power . Organization of a third ( instead of half ) of the state into a self-conscious bloc of power could " revolutionize Alabama politics , " although in a way that Mr. Huie doubtless would abhor . He gives his game away in talk about " Congo-like , " " mass take-overs " by " uneducated Negroes . " There is a school of " moderation " in Alabama , attended by Negroes and whites alike , who bear no prejudice except to the " uneducated " ; who seek to extend democracy in Alabama , except to the " uneducated " ; who would like black and white to rule together , over the " uneducated . " Dr. Gomillion of the predominantly-Negro Tuskegee Institute ( I should not have called it al/-Negro ) and the leaders of the Alabama Democratic Conference Inc. may do much to increase the political power of many Alabama Negroes ; they are not going to be able to do it for all the Negroes , most of whom are " uneducated " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uneducated " and " poor " are pretty well interchangeable in that context ) . SNCC so far does not have the resources to do what it wants to do , but if it did , a third of the state and the heavy concentrations of Negroes in Black Belt counties is more than enough to work with . Negroes make up far less than a majority of the population of Cleveland , Ohio , and last month ( in the campaign of Carl Stokes for mayor ) they came within a hair 's breadth of " taking over " and even so have changed Ohio 's politics . Andrew Kopkind Audio-Visual Aids Sirs : There is an all too common paradox contained in Christopher Jencks ' stimulating article on school legislation ( Education : What Next ? ) which was featured in the October 16 issue . While exhibiting an admirable passion for social progress through expanded educational opportunities , Mr. Jencks exposes a peculiar hostility to one of the most promising sources of educational progress . Mr. Jencks submits that one of the chief virtues of the proposed National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a couple of years be able to land regular teaching jobs and get certification without the usual nonsense about courses in audio-visual aids . " To verbally slam the door on audiovisuals is to turn from the very technology which may make it possible to offer quality education to the vastly increased number of young people who would be attending schools under the federal programs of scholarships which Mr. Jencks obviously supports . After all , most colleges are already overcrowded , and at every level of American education the ratio of new teachers to new students is deteriorating . As long ago as World War II it was convincingly demonstrated that audiovisual aids can improve the efficiency of teaching by presenting information in such a way that it can be absorbed at a more rapid rate , and will be retained longer afterward . If we are to teach more and more students with fewer and fewer teachers , relatively speaking , then it is apparent that teaching efficiencies must be achieved . And ? most important ? these efficiencies DECEMBER 18 , 1965 must be achieved without in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audio-visuals accomplish this ? Let me mention three ways as examples : Large-screen projection , coupled with closed-circuit television when appropriate , has made it possible for teachers to effectively teach classes of several hundred students by overcoming the barriers to what a student can see and hear from the back of the room . Audio-visuals can relieve the teacher of some of the more routine areas of instruction so that he can concentrate efforts where his personal presentation will have the greatest effect . Audiovisuals make possible individual instruction at different levels and pace within a single group so that each student has a better opportunity to learn up to his maximum capacity . In reply : My comment was not intended to offend either Mr. Hulfish or his employers , for their merchandise can be useful to teachers . I am , however , skeptical about the value of courses on the use of audio-visual aids , which in my experience consist of lessons in how to run different species of tape recorders and movie projectors plus banalities on the use of such equipment in lesson-planning . Christopher Jencks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1943 , when General Stillwell , smitten by overwhelmingly superior forces fighting on an impossible terrain , reeled back out of the Burma jungle , the publicity boys in Washington burst frantically into their customary song-anddance about its being a planned withdrawal to permit regrouping of our forces to strike the badly battered enemy a finishing blow , therefore it was tantamount to a victory . But some correspondent somehow slipped through a direct quotation : " I , " said Vinegar Joe , " say we took a hell of a licking . " Coming at a bad moment of a huge and desperate war , this , of course destroyed civilian morale and caused us THE NEW REPUBLIC to surrender ? or did it ? Memory does n't present it that way . Memory asserts that morale stiffened , that we did n't surrender , and that we won the war . Something has been happening recently in the Ia Drang valley in Vietnam , which the publicity boys are presenting as practically a victory . Nobody has said flatly that some uniformed idiot marched two battalions into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we took a helly of a licking . Even if it were true , nobody would say it because saying it would destroy civilian morale . Think what happened when Stillwell admitted his defeat . Cuba and Communism Sirs : ? Lee Lockwood 's robust epithets ( " Cu-ba 's New Beat , Dec. 11 ) about . my " inaccuracy , gossip and superficial judgment " in describing Cuba as I saw it puzzle me . Except where he totally misread me , and barring his apparent conclusion that by mugging up their Marxism the Fidelista faithful are going to gain a sounder grasp of the island 's economic problems and their solution , I ca n't see that we disagree too much . I go along with Lockwood that Communism is there to stay in Cuba for the forseeable future . I certainly agree it would be wishful thinking ? assuming you deem this a matter for wishing much either way ? to suppose that Castro is about to blow away like a puffball in the wind . . . . But from the tone of his letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Castro 's followers are putting the clock forward , or that everything stops there . History reaches the end of the line . That is simply bosh ! I agree the Cuban press and radio today blast away continuously about the Bay of Pigs and warn the populace to be ever alert against Yankee aggression . But I strongly suspect that constant reiteration of the theme numbs the senses . In any event , during my visit I did not find a solitary Cuban , either official or private citizen , who seriously expects another CIA-backed invasion . Just because Granma , the party paper , prints yards of copy daily harking back to heroic revolutionary legends , does not mean it gets read . It is significant that its rival , which tries to be as apolitical as circumstances permit , sells better . Indeed , Castro had to merge his two Communist sheets recently . Lockwood may be right about his four batteries of mobile ack-ack " of late Russian manufacture " stationed in the Hotel Nacional grounds . I was in and out of the place a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had been moved by the time I got to Havana . In any case , four batteries ? and I think he must mean four guns since four batteries would be sixteen , and packing that many into a garden would create a certain congestion ? is nothing to get excited about . It is no secret that the Russians have given Castro plenty of military hardware . They can spare it ? like those snow ploughs . But lacking an industrial base , as they do , the Cubans can do little more than parade it through the streets on high days and holidays . I suppose their SAM-2s could knock down a U-2 , in theory . So what ? Lockwood seems tremendously impressed by what he calls a " terrestrial Strategic Air Command " in the shape of " Battalion 500 . " A curious image ! No doubt it could fight , if there was anyone seeking to engage it . But unless the Russians make Castro a present of a big fleet of landing-craft , I can not see what the outfit is for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls are drilled with real rifles . This seems more sinister to Lockwood than it does to me . We British do the same in our school OTC 's . My lo-year-old son is rather a good shot . Even in highly civilized Switzerland every male adult is so trained , and , what is more , keeps his service rifle in his home , ready to spring to the nation 's defense . Israel , with more reason , is similarly geared up for citizen war . As for whether Castro is training more or fewer cadres for export to Latin America , as liberators or whatever , Lockwood admits this is anyone 's guess . My information is that Cuba 's Russian patrons are distinctly cool toward such movements at present . Quite apart from being reluctant to get into any head-on collision with the US , the Kremlin can hardly be anxious to subsidize more costly satellites yet awhile . I can not think why Lockwood should feel I implied Castro is not sincere in his espousal of Communism . I am sure he is . My guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a youthful liberal humanist and at the other stages of his political development . What I did say , and reaffirm , is that certain dyed-in-the-wool Muscovite-type CP people , who were perhaps more readily available to me than they might have been to Lockwood who I gather is on chummy terms with Fidel , displayed boredom in their attitude toward the Maximum Leader 's enthusiasms . . . . So long as he concerns himself with improving the lot of his people ? and only time can tell about that ? I can not see much point in being scared of Castro . I can sympathize with his wish to shed the shackles of colonialism and rid Cuba of its old dependence on the US . It is , of course , ironic that in doing so he finds himself dependent on the USSR . It is a pity , I think , that , in making the transition , he had to lumber himself with the antiquated dogma of Marxism . Perhaps he will grow out of it or , as Lockwood puts it , " evolve an original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs and aspirations . " Unlike Lockwood , however , I doubt whether such a Communism exists , even in limbo . But everyone to his taste .
