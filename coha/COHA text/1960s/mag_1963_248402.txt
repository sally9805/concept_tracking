One commodity market that is in better shape than ever is the esoteric and specialized worldwide market in postage stamps . In Manhattan last week , the costliest stamp in history was auctioned for $41,000 by Bernard Harmer , U.S. partner of London 's H. R. Harmer Ltd. , the world 's leading stamp firm . It is a pale blue , unused 2 Hawaiian Missionary stamp-so called because such stamps were mostly used by Christian missionaries writing home in the mid-19th century-and it replaced the renowned British Guiana one-cent magenta ( $32,900 ) as the world 's most valuable stamp . Its sale also proved once again that stamp collecting is a lot more than child 's play . <P> Not Just Relaxation . It is , in fact , a $50 million to $100 million international business that supports hundreds of firms , reaches into virtually every country and caters to the acquisitive urges of several million collectors , from the majority who only dabble in stamps to the considerable number of absorbed adult collectors who spend at least $1,000 a year . Harmer 's alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or private sale . Several small nations that philatelists consider particularly interesting-including Monaco , Liechtenstein , San Marino , the Vatican and lately Ghana-depend on selling their stamps to collectors as a way of replenishing their treasuries . Pitcairn Island , where the Bounty mutineers settled , receives almost half its revenue from stamps that never see Pitcairn but pass directly to stamp dealers from a printing plant in London . Since collectors by nature covet every issue of their specialties , such stamps are quickly bought up despite the large numbers printed . <P> The biggest stamp collectors are as secretive as Swiss bankers , and the extent of their collections frequently comes to light only after their death . For such men , stamps are as much of a financial investment as a relaxation . <P> The reason is that good stamps , by their rarity , continually increase in value , can be tax-valued at fractional catalogue prices to escape staggering death duties , and are often even more valuable than stocks as a hedge against worldwide inflation .

Wall Street Broker Alfred Caspary 's 50,000 stamps were sold beginning in 1955 for $2,900,000 , and represented a quarter of the value of his estate . The collection of Swiss Tobacco Magnate Maurice Burrus , from which the rare 2 Hawaiian came , will probably realize $8,000,000 when it is all disposed of . Burrus paid $15,000 for the Hawaiian in 1921 ; last week 's sale thus represented a 275% increase in value . <P>
