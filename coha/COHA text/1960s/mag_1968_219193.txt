Some pictures are put-ons that seem to plead for a tacit agreement with their audience : what is to be viewed is beneath contempt , therefore it is beyond criticism . Disarmed , audiences are presumably free to enjoy the movie in the same way they appreciate the sheer ghastliness of Mrs. Miller 's wobbly warbling or the fruity falsetto of Tiny Tim . Two current examples come from <P> American International , the studio that perfected the beachboy epic . <P> The Savage Seven begins with a bare-chested Indian looming in the foreground , knife in hand . Another brave leaps forward and they begin to grapple to the death . Then comes an offscreen voice , " Will you guys quit screwing around ? " The time is the present , and the Indians are a bunch of tribesmen trapped in a California poverty pocket . From out of the hills comes the Enemy , on wheels-and suddenly the ignoble savages find themselves in a stereotypical motorcycle picture . <P> There are occasional flickers of intentional humor , as when a cyclist looks inside a shack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shriver ? " The best laughs are caused by the scenes of violence , when the Indians decide they would rather be Redskins than dead-skins and beat the living Hell 's Angels out of the motorcycle gang . It all ends as it began , in chaos , proving itself ideal kapok to fill out the lower end of double bills in drive-ins . <P> The top half of the bill might well be Wild in the Streets . The thesis of the movie is that the U.S. is ripe for a teen-age **27;5908;TOOLONG , a theme explored recently in the English film Privilege . The central character is a delinquent ( Christopher Jones ) who caterwauls his way into the hearts of young America . An opportunistic Senator ( Hal Holbrook ) gets a law passed that enfranchises 15-year-olds . They elect Jones President , and suddenly , he-and-shedonism is for everyone under 35 . Oldsters who have passed that milestone are packed into concentration camps and mind-blown with a steady diet of LSD . <P> Even though the antihero has no morals , drive-in flicks always do . Ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring the joke full circle by insisting : " Everybody over ten ought to be put out of business . " Everybody would include the operators of American International . That could be the greatest put-on of them all .
