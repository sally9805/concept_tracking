The decision yesterday by Supreme . Court Justice Abraham N. Geller directed the Human Rights Commission to take steps to return to court for a permanent injunction against the sale of the house to anyone else , should conciliatory efforts fail within the next 90 days .

The testimony also disclosed that after the sisters complained to the City Human Rights Commission , Mr. Vitucci offered them the house for $42,500 . This " belated offer was viewed as excessive and discriminatory , " Justice Geller commented , in a decision handed down Friday . " The inference is clear that defendant 's failure to enter into any negotiations with complainants , despite their repeated attempts to negotiate , during the continued period of his continuing sales offer of this house to the general public is attributable to discrimination because of their race , " he continued . Their efforts to purchase the house have included appeals to the City 's Commission for Human Rights , Corporation Counsel and Investigation Department , and also the New York Department of State .

" Mrs. Braithewaite , who has been living in the Bedford , Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn , said she had sought to buy the house because good schools were nearby which her two boys , 11 and 13 years old , could attend , and because her present apartment was too small " for a growing family . " Her husband is a merchant seaman . The 90-day injunction against sale of the house granted by Justice Geller had been applied for early this year , following a complaint to the City Department of Investigation . The complaint was filed by Focus , the Brooklyn Fair Housing Committee affiliated with the New York Urban League 's Operation Open City . The complaint alleged that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office had been negligent in their handling of the case . Focus and Operation Open City also assisted with volunteer legal , counsel , and picketed Mr. Vitucci 's home at 2182 East 37th Street in Brooklyn . " I could n't believe this was Brooklyn , U.S.A. , 1965 , " Mrs. Braithewaite said of the picketing , in which she joined with 18. others , last August . " About 300 of Mr. Vitucci 's neighbors yelled obscenities at us that -I did n't think adults would ever say before their children . They threw rotten eggs at us , and fruit  --  and one waved a Confederate flag . " I could n't have believed it if I had n't seen it with my own eyes , " Mrs. Braithewaite continued . " My sister and I grew up in New . York , In a neighborhood with Jews and Italians and other ethnic groups  --  and had never known anything like this before . " Mrs. Braithewaite said ? she had faced up to , the fact that even it she succeeds in getting the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of neighborhood hostility , as was the case reported yesterday of a Pennsylvania Negro family . " I have tried to condition my children to this . " she said . However , she continued gently , " It is our money and as American citizens we should be able to move where we want tol move . " " Unless white and Negroes live together you can talk theory until the end of time and nothing will come of it , " she asserted . " My husband has some misgivings , but he is leaving it to me . I believe I owe it to my children to go ahead so they wo n't grow up in a world thinking only black children live in The two sisters , aided by Focus and Operation City , have been more successful with state agencies than with city groups to date , In January they obtained from the Secretary of State a suspension of the license of the broker who rented the apartments in the house while their complaint was pending .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
