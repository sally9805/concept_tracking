txt The Rockefeller administration and the leaders of the Legislature have reached tentative agreement on , stiffer penalties against striking public employe unions and their members , including the loss of pay for individual strikers. ? One matter still to be decided , according to sources close to the negotiations , is the size of the wage penalty . Governor Rockefeller 's office has suggested - that individual strikers be docked one and a half days for every day they remain on strike . But some of the legislative " hawks " are asking for two days ' pay . Final decisions on this and some other loose ends in the negotiations to tighten the twoyear-old Taylor Law are expected to be reached in the next few dais . lob Action ' Looms Both the Governor and the legislative leaders want to pass a bill and sign it into law before March 13 . This is the date for which the Civil Service Employes Association  --  the union that represents most of the state 's 150,000 employes ? has threatened either a strike or some unspecified " job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the negotiations between the Gov , governor 's office and the leaders vas a provision allowing the courts to suspend a union 's coveted dues checkoff privileges for an unlimited length of time . Under the present Taylor Law , the maximum suspension time is 18 months . The leaders and the Governor 's office have also reached tentative agreement , according to the authoritative sources , on giving the courts the power Conilnued on Page 40 , Column 5 Lawmakers and Governor Agree On Stiffer Fines for Taylor Law // to levy unlimited fines against striking public employe unions . Present law sets a maximum on such fines of $10,000 , or a week 's dues , for each day of a strike  --  whichever is less . There is some pressure , the sources said , for also putting a mandatory minimum on the fine  --  scaled to a union 's treasury ? so that no union could escape scot-free . Bit this matter is still up in the air . In agreeing on a provision to dock strikers ' pay , the Governor and the leaders have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the discredited Condon-Wadlin Law , which the legislators deemed unenforceable and replaced with the Taylo'r Law in 1967 . Under Condon-Wadlin , whose emphasis was . on penalties against individual strikers rather than their unions , each istriker was supposed to lose two days ' pay for each day he was off the job . However , few attempts were ever made in the 20-year history of the Condon-Wadlin Law to impose this penalty . Nevertheless both the Governor and the leaders have become adamant on the issue of individual penalties , primarily because of the rash of recent public-employe strikes , particularly in New York City . They reportedly feel that union leaders have , in many instances , lost control of their militant memberships and that individual penalties will restore some of that control . Some high sources here contend that many leaders of the public-employe unions , though publicly opposed to such fines , have privately communicated their desire for them . The Governor turned hawkish on the penalty question after the strike last November by workers at four state mental hospitals . It was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikers ' pay , sources here said , was a compromise . Tougher proposals ? such as providing automatic dismissal of strikers and making it a felony to go on strike ? were considered during the negotiations but discarded . Linked to the loss-of-pay provision was a provision setting up some kind of " summary near automatic procedure " for swiftly determining whether an individual was guilty of striking , so his pay could be docked with little delay . At present the only procedure for establishing a public employe 's ? guilt is that of Section 75 of the state 's Civil Service Law , which is considered cumbersome , slow and difficult to enforce . In general , the agreement being worked out by the Governor and the leaders of the Republican-controlled Legislature follows the recent recommendations of Mr. Rockefeller 's panel of labor-relations experts on the subject of penalties against unions . But it goes far beyond those recommendations in the penalties against individual strikers .

Sources here , however , I said that Dr. Taylor and his colleagues were privately " amenable " to the new penalties . As for the penalties against unions , the leaders and the Governor are , in essence , simply going back to the original 1966 Taylor proposals for unlimited punishments . These proposals were watered down by the 1967 Legislature when it passed the Taylor Law , because of pressure from the . labor-oriented Democrats who then controlled the Assembly . The Republicans now control both houses of the Legislature . This control , however , is very slim in the Assembly  - -  78 to 72  --  and a loss of only three votes would mean a loss of the necessary 75-vote majority needed to pass a bill .
