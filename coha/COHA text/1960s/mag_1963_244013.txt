For the first time , Morocco 's Ahmed Benhima presided over the Security Council . Turning to the chairman , Ghana 's fiery Ambassador Alex Quaison-Sackey cried in an inverted echo of Churchill : " He has been called upon by destiny to preside over the liquidation of the Portuguese Empire . " <P> The statement proved somewhat exaggerated . But if Lisbon 's sprawling , 500-year-old African outback was n't being liquidated last week , it was certainly under siege-together with its neighbor and partner , South Africa . Having called the Security Council into session , the 32-nation African bloc demanded that 1 ) Portugal get out of her colonies of Angola , Mozambique and Portuguese Guinea , and 2 ) the world help throttle South Africa 's apartheid regime . Behind both demands lay a deeper motive : to eliminate the last strongholds of white rule on the Dark Continent . <P> Favored Countries . For ten days , the green-and-gold Council chamber rang with debate over Mother Portugal 's Africa-the largest European empire still intact , one which is plagued by poverty , rebellion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totalitarianism tempered by inefficiency . " In a fascinating train of logic , the Africans argued that because they themselves are threatening to " liberate " the territories , Portugal 's continued presence in them endangers the peace . <P> In rebuttal , Portuguese Foreign Minister Alberto Franco Nogueira bitterly recalled that 1 ) his country saw its Asian enclave of Goa overrun by India in 1961 , and 2 ) the Congo officially established military training camps against Angola , both without U.N . protest . Said he : " We have two sets of countries . Some are allowed anything they please with any justification which may occur to them ; others are not . " <P> The Africans wanted the Council to order an embargo on arms to Portugal that could be used for " repression of the peoples . " Although Washington has already curtailed such arms , the U.S. 's Adlai Stevenson balked , pleaded that the U.N . should stick to persuasion . A watered-down resolution , which passed 8 to 0 , " requests " the arms embargo and " urgently calls upon " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Although Stevenson had agreed to the final draft , he was abruptly overruled by Washington , possibly because the U.S. is renegotiating a lease with Portugal for use of the Azores . Leaving the way open for future action , the resolution directs Secretary-General U Thant to report by Oct. 31 on Portugal 's response . In Lisbon , a Foreign Ministry official said : " We 've been stubborn for centuries and are n't going to change now . " <P> Next Case . The Council then took up South Africa , where 3,000,000 whites rule 11 million blacks under a system the government once termed apartheid but now prefers to call " separate development . " Pressing the charge that white supremacy is " intolerable , " External Affairs Minister John Karefa-Smart of Sierra Leone claimed that the U.N . has every right to intervene- " National barriers can not legitimately shrink universal human rights .
