The big news that rates the big headlines may roll in from half the world away , but the best newspapers never forget that they are local . Most of their readers get most of their kicks from reading about the neighbors . <P> In Los Angeles , a city of transplanted small-towners , the Times caters to that persistent curiosity with a staff of 50 local reporters and acres of community news . It goes even further and offers something special in the way of chatty , back-fence journalism . In a column called " On the Move , " it covers all of Southern California as if it were Main Street , reporting the doings of beekeepers at the foot of Mount Palomar and lettuce growers in the Imperial Valley in a nostalgic reminder of a life that flows at an easier pace . " Across the street , " wrote Columnist Ed Ainsworth after a Sunday service in little Escondido , " church was letting out , and friends lingered on the sidewalk in the bright sunshine to chat , an art which seems forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the half-forgotten art of small-town life in Southern California 's hill towns and desert byways , Ainsworth is one of a vanishing breed of peripatetic reporters .

He finished high school in Waco , Texas , in a wheelchair , but set out soon afterward for San Francisco to cover the 1920 Democratic National Convention , at space rates , for the local News Tribune . As it happened , the Democrats merited precious little space for nominating James M. Cox . " I got about $3 , " recalls Ainsworth . But he went on working for papers from San Pedro to Atlanta before landing a job with the Los Angeles Times in 1924 . <P> Ainsworth rose to chief editorial writer , but after a 1959 heart attack he began " On the Move . " The column is more than just folksy , for Ainsworth is a local-history buff who garnishes his prose with obscure tidbits of information and relishes exotic place names .
