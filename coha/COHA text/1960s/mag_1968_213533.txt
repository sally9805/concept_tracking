U.S. Navy commanders are only too keenly aware of the growing strength and aggressiveness of the Soviet navy . Russian ships shadow every NATO maneuver , break into allied formations , and show the red flag in the world 's most sensitive trouble spots . Last week the Pentagon received reassurance of sorts . According to the 1968-69 edition of Jane 's Fighting Ships , the longtime civilian authority on all the world 's navies , " Soviet maritime strategy is defensive or containing rather than provoking or aggressive . " <P> In fact , said Jane 's , the Soviet navy 's activity may be no more than " a determination to mark the ships of other navies in much the same way that players mark their opposite numbers in a soccer game . " Jane 's assesses a formidable number of Soviet players , among them : 55 nuclear-powered submarines , most of them of the hunter-killer type ; 325 conventionally powered subs ; 25 cruisers ; 100 destroyers ; two new helicopter carriers . <P> " At first sight , " concedes Jane 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be poised for control of all ingress and egress about narrow waters . " But Jane 's detects a " subtlety not generally appreciated by laymen . Most recent Soviet warships were apparently designed for a self-sufficient limited role of being able to reply to any attack made on them rather than to pose an attitude of strike action . " <P> <P> That is a matter of Jane 's semantics-and Soviet intention . There is no doubt that the Soviet fleet has an offensive capability and has been considerably stretching the concept of strategic defense . Soviet submarines appeared in the Indian Ocean for the first time last winter , and only last week the helicopter carrier Moskva turned up in the Mediterranean . That , declared U.S. Admiral Thomas H. Moorer , Chief of Naval Operations , is " visible evidence of Russia 's announced intention to be come a modern major offensive sea power . " <P> Jane 's was more perceptibly disturbed over the decline of the Royal Navy . Its major force is now down to four aircraft carriers , 21 postwar-built conventional submarines , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Royal Navy , " says Jane 's , " has taken a cruel knock . It is hardly adequate for peacetime defense , and insufficient for war . " Perhaps the cruelest knock of all was Jane 's judgment that by the 1970s , if present plans are carried through , the French navy will be stronger than Britain 's by a margin of two aircraft carriers and one nuclear sub . So much for the navy that William Blackstone , back in 1765 , was able to call " England 's greatest defense and ornament ; its ancient and natural strength ; the floating bulwark of the island .
