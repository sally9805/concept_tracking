When a couple of young hoods of the tiny , neo-Nazi German Reich Party daubed swastikas on a Cologne synagogue last Christmas Eve , a sort of involuntary twinge stirred memories round the world . Surely not again ? The rash of similar incidents that followed , in Germany and abroad , are now on the wane , but at week 's end , with a vehemence rare in him . Chancellor Konrad Adenauer went on the air with a remedy for anti-Semites in action : " I say to all my German fellow citizens , if you catch a ruffian anywhere , execute the punishment on the spot and give him a sound thrashing . " <P> Then Adenauer said : " I turn to my German Jewish fellow citizens and say to them that they can be completely free of worry . This state stands behind them with its entire might . I guarantee this to them . " <P> Adenauer was alarmed by the furor the sick manifestations of anti-Semitism in Germany had stirred abroad , particularly in Britain , and by the criticism that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Nazi misdeeds of 20 years ago while ex-Nazis are turning up in high places , in both East and West German governments . Among prominent officials with a Nazi past in Bonn : <P> Hans Globke. 61 , State Secretary and Adenauer 's closest government adviser , was author of the official commentary to Hitler 's notorious racist laws of 1935 while an official of the Interior Ministry . <P> Refugee Minister Theodor Oberlaender , 54 , who was a political officer with the Wehrmacht 's Nightingale Battalion of pro-German Ukrainian nationalists when they entered Lvov in 1941 . Before an international commission in The Hague this month , Oberlaender denied a charge that he ordered the massacre of 2,400 Ukrainians , Poles and Jews at Lvov , declared that the Russians did it before he got there . <P> Federal Property Minister Hermann Lindrath , 63 , was enrolled as a Hitler storm trooper in 1934 , a Nazi Party member in 1937 . <P> Interior Minister Gerhard Schroeder , 49 , was a Hitler storm trooper in 1933 , a Nazi Party member in 1937 . <P> Full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a former Nazi is as likely as not to answer . One in every three present West German M.P.s was once a Nazi , one in every ten East German M.P.s . The Chief Justice of the Communist East German Supreme Court is an old-time Nazi , the head of the Communist East German Academy of State and Legal Sciences a former high-ranking SS officer . Indignantly correcting a critic a few years ago , Chancellor Adenauer said that " only 66% " of the Bonn Foreign Office 's senior officials had been Nazi Party members . Perhaps half of all senior civil servants in West German ministries were once Nazis , and the proportion is probably not much less in the East German regime . At least eight West German ambassadors were Nazi Party members . About a third of all German judges were connected in one way or another with the Hitler regime . But , said Chancellor Adenauer last week , the world should recognize that the majority of Germans had served Naziism " only under the hard pressure of dictatorship . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
