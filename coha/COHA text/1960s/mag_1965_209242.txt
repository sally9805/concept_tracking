Oh ! see and behold the stars On the waving banner ; They are a sign that Samoa Is able to lead . Oh ! <P> - National Anthem of Western Samoa <P> Two months ago Stuttgart 's Institute of Foreign Relations published its latest revised edition of The National An thems of the World . It was outdated even before it went on sale . So fast are new nations emerging these days that the anthems of Africa 's two newest , Gambia and Zambia , appeared after the anthology had gone to press . At last count there were more than 150 assorted anthems in the world , hailing the glories of every nation from Red China ( " Build anew the Great Wall from flesh and blood , arise ! " ) to tiny Liechtenstein ( " Where the chamois freely jumps about " ) and Cameroon ( " In barbaric times you lived your early days/But bit by bit you now are leaving savage ways " ) . <P> No More Moonlight . For some nations , having an anthem at all seems almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribesmen , for example , are unaware that they are members of a nation , much less that they have a song to rise to . Nevertheless , the anthem is something no independent state can do without . Even if national pride did not demand one , international protocol would , and both the British and French , who between them have launched most of the world 's new nations , have seen to it that even such remote places as Upper Volta have something to play . " When independence is clearly on the way , " says a British colonial officer , " it 's usually up to the man on the spot to get them thinking about all the trappings and trimmings . " <P> A few budding governments have composed their own . Senegal 's anthem ( " The red Lion has roared/The Tamer of the Bush has jumped forward " ) was written by Poet-President Leopold Senghor , Jamaica 's by the Minister of Industry , the Ivory Coast 's by its Information Minister . Malaysia expropriated an Indonesian love song called Moonlight , changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's solution was to graft the hymnlike words of one proposed anthem ( " O God of all creation/Bless this our land and nation " ) onto the music of a Pokomo tribal lullaby . <P> Too Many Tongues . The creation of anthems is particularly difficult in Africa , where skilled composers are rare . Some governments have asked their former colonial masters to write their anthems for them ; one Frenchman composed the tunes for two West African states . Seven African anthems have been produced by local priests . Seven nations held anthem contests , with the winners being judged either by governmental decision or popular poll . Two English ladies won the Nigerian contest ; and in Malawi , where the winner was a native organist , the government was so delighted with his effort ( " Put down each and every enemy/ Hunger , disease , envy " ) that it sent him to London to study music .
