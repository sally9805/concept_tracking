 | When I entered the service of Prince Rainier and Princess Grace of Monaco , their daughter Caroline was a year old , and Albert , heir to the throne , had just been christened . Although I was only twenty , it was n't the first time I had worked for famous people . I had previously cared for the children of the Princess de Merode of Belgium and those of the noted French playwright , Jean Anouilh . But in March , 1958 , when I heard that Princess Grace was looking for a children 's nurse , I was at home , in Rugby , England . I said to my sister Patricia , " Would n't it be fabulous to work for her ? " But I did n't feel that I had a chance ? hundreds of girls must be after the same job as " nanny " ? so I did n't even bother to apply . You can imagine how surprised I was , then , when I received an invitation to visit Monaco for an interview . Patricia had secretly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took me to meet the children . From her private apartment in the palace , a fairy-tale structure of stone porti- coes and square towers , we crossed a courtyard to the nursery . That proved to be a big , bright room with one side almost entirely of glass . On the other walls were a copy of Picasso 's Happy King , a Jean Cocteau poster of a fish in a top hat , family photographs , and , above each child 's bed , a beautiful , simple gold cross . The white wicker furniture with its brightly colored cushions and the toys overflowing from their cupboard gave the room a gay look . On the floor , amid a whole menagerie of stuffed animals ? lions , elephants , teddy bears , poodles sat a little girl with beautiful dark hair and striking blue eyes . Young as she was , she was n't a bit shy , but politely said hello , then turned back to a book she was pretending to read . From his crib , blond baby Albert gurgled happily at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment ? a dressing room , kitchen , and a bedroom and bathroom for the nurse . For the next seven years , as it turned out , this was to be my domain . They were wonderful , exciting years , and as I look back I find it hard to choose among my memories of them ? the difficulties and dangers as well as the joys . There was the hot , dry summer , for example , when we were at Roc Agel , the country house of in the Maritime Alps . It is surrounded by brush and olive and pine trees , which are beautiful but a source of danger in the dry season . One afternoon , the Princess was in the kitchen preparing one of her specialties , American fried chicken , and I was giving the children their evening bath , when a guard ran up to the house . Saluting , he reported to the Prince , " Your Highness , there is suspicious smoke at the foot of the hill . " Prince Rainier immediately sent men to investigate . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building up below Roc Agel . But at that time there was no wind , and it did not seem likely that the fire would spread . We went in to dinner and complimented the Princess on her cooking . But before dinner was over , a wind sprang up and whipped the fire into a rampaging forest of flames . As the hours fled by , the flames crept up the mountainside , closer and closer to the house . Cars were drawn up the driveway to evacuate the household by the only road out of Roc Agel , a precipitous winding way that drops steeply in hairpin bends . But by 1:30 A.M. even the escape route seemed cut off . The flames had formed a circle around us . By two o'clock , I could distinctly hear them crackling , and a few minutes later I could see them , lapping forward through the  | brush that surrounded the house . The Prince rushed back to say , " You 'd better get ready . " Without a word the Princess and I went to the children 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I got Albert out of bed . My fingers were trembling . Both children , by now , had seen the flames through the windows and were frightened , but they made no fuss . Outside , their ponies were whinnying with fear . Just as we were about to leave the house , Caroline disappeared . I searched frantically for her . Moments later she reappeared ? she had gone off to fetch her pet parakeet and was clutching its cage tenderly . Then we heard an indistinct cry over the roar of the fire . It was repeated : " The wind has turned ! " Just as suddenly as it had come , the wind veered away from Roc Agel and swept away the curtain of fire , driving it around to the other side of the mountain . There , it burned on for three days but we were safe . Public functions are an important part of the life of the Prince and Princess , and , when circumstances permit , they make a point of including Caroline and Albert , as part of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an audience , she may ask Caroline to sit near her on the rostrum . You would expect a nineyear-old girl to have stage fright or to fidget , but not Caroline . She sits there quietly , gazing at the audience with interest . When she spies someone she knows , though , protocol is slightly bent . She gives a little nod in their direction , or makes a surreptitious signal of greeting . Albert accompanies his father on ceremonial occasions more and more often . Sometimes he has to be coaxed : " Albert , there may be a reception after the ceremony , with champagne and canapes ! " That usually lures him from his beloved toy cars , for he enjoys a sip of champagne if he can get away with it . The children , of course , do not take part in the fabulous Monte Carlo galas ? evening entertainments over which their parents preside . But once we did have a gala of our own . This was when the Prince and Princess went to the wedding of Greek King Constantine and Princess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a little disappointed at not going too , so we organized our own party in the palace . Before the Princess left , she let Caroline borrow one of her old evening gowns the very dress which , I believe , the Princess wore at her coming-out party in Philadelphia . Caroline hitched it up around her skinny little hips and perched in front of her mother 's dressing table . When I came in she was carefully applying lipstick , powder and even mascara . Albert donned a prized gift ? a miniature dress uniform of an American marine , complete with white belt and toy decorations on his chest . I had to put on my own evening gown . Then Albert proudly escorted us to the table , which was carefully laid , and lit with tall red candles . The valets , who love the children and enjoy their pranks , had put on their gala livery , complete with tails , white tie and gloves . After dinner , notable for the absence of boiled carrots , which Albert detests , Caroline announced , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record on the phonograph . Albert danced the opening waltz with his sister and then took me for a turn around the nursery . We had as much fun as all the crowned heads assembled that night in Athens ! In the back of the palace garage , Prince Rainier has built his own playroom . That 's where he keeps his electric  | trains and his collection of miniature remote-control sports cars . Naturally , the children ? especially Albert ? love being admitted to this sanctum . But you would be surprised at the number of grownups who love to go there too and make the trains and cars roar around . The room can also be converted , by pulling a curtain , into a private movie theater . This is where Caroline and Albert first saw their mother on the screen . They knew that their mother was once an actress and had seen the stills she keeps in large leather albums . But the Princess hesitated for a long time before letting them see a film in which she plays a love scene . Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Thief , in which she starred with Cary Grant . The children had met Mr. Grant and knew many of the locations on the French Riviera shown in the movie . Caroline and Albert watched the film with fascination . When the lights went on , we all looked at them , wondering what comment they would make . There was a moment of silence , then Albert piped up , " Mummy , you were awfully thin then . " And that was all . Later they were allowed to see High Noon , with Gary Cooper . I asked them whom they had liked best in the film , expecting them to say " Mummy , " but the answer was " the cowboys ! " When Princess Grace was expecting her third child , Stephanie , the usual delicate problem arose : how and what to tell the children . The Princess is a firm believer in the truth , and when her condition became noticeable she called in Caroline and Albert and frankly explained matters to them . One day not long afterward when an ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had caught a bad cold , he found Caroline in bed with a big pillow stuffed between her stomach and the blanket . " What are you doing there ? " he asked . " Having a baby , " Caroline replied . " And there it is , " she added , whisking out a blonde doll . Another day , when the Princess ' physician came to call on her , he found Caroline playing in the corridor . " Aha , " he observed , " soon the stork will bring a little baby . " Caroline frowned at him . " How can a doctor still believe in the story of the stork ? " she asked scornfully . From the earliest age , Caroline absorbed the quality of motherly love from Princess Grace . She showered this love on her collection of dolls . Today she has almost a hundred . There are dolls in national costumes of various countries , which her parents gave her in order to teach her about geography and the world . There are dolls dressed in crinolines , skiing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening gowns . There are a Queen Elizabeth doll and a Caroline Kennedy doll . And then there are the dolls which the Prince says will be " the ruination of me , " the teenage dolls for which you can ? and in the case of the Prince and Caroline , you must ? buy additional dresses , hats , shoes , gloves , bags , jewelry and even wigs . The Prince has also built for Caroline a great wooden doll 's house . One day when we were aboard the royal yacht Albecaro ( the name is derived from " Albert " plus " Caroline " ) a strange shape came stumbling up the gangplank . We watched in fascination as two enormous cartons advanced toward us . Behind them , puffing slightly , was Frank Sinatra . The cartons contained presents for the children ? a set of twin dolls complete with clothes for Caroline and a huge set of toy cars for Albert . On another occasion , at Easter , Cary Grant dropped by ? and solved a domestic problem that always arises at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . On this occasion Mrs. Plaistowe , the palace housekeeper , announced to her staff , " I need a volunteer to make up a guest apartment . " The plea was met with a notable lack of enthusiasm . " A guest apartment for Cary Grant , " she added ? and was almost bowled over in the rush . Later there was a fierce competition as to who would get to iron Mr. Grant 's pajamas ! In a way my life with Prince Rainier @# and Princess Grace was like a movie , filled with excitement and peopled with glamorous personages . Sometimes the supporting cast even included Sir Winston Churchill . During his later years Sir Winston often came to the palace . Both the Prince and the Princess admired this giant of the western world . But at the time I had the honor of meeting Sir Winston , Caroline and Albert were a little hazy as to who he was . It happened when we took an Air France plane to Nice on our way to Ireland . As Caroline , Albert and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winston sitting in the front row . It was a tremendous thrill for me . The children , with their usual intuitiveness , sensed my emotion . " Who is that man ? " Caroline asked in a whisper . " That is Sir Winston Churchill , " I explained , " a very great man . " " Is he as important as my daddy ? " Caroline wanted to know . " Yes , indeed , " I replied . Sir Winston had noticed us boarding the plane . He loved young children and remembered Caroline and Albert . As soon as we were in flight , he sent word that he wanted to see them . I took them up the aisle and Sir Winston beamed at them . Then he reached out , took Caroline 's tiny hand , and kissed it . Caroline was enchanted and remembers the gesture to this very day . She became an immediate and ardent fan of Sir Winston . As usual she was traveling with her favorite doll , Poor Pitiful Pearl , a sad-looking character with stringy hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the most beautiful thing in the world , and her most cherished possession . " Do you think that nice man would like to hold Poor Pearl ? " Caroline suddenly asked me . " Why do n't you ask him ? " I suggested . Sir Winston accepted the offer with delight , and Caroline carefully placed the doll in his arms . Sir Winston allowed it to flop to one side . " Not like that , " Caroline said sternly , and took his arm and adjusted it more firmly around her darling . With good grace , Sir Winston complied . The sight of him meekly holding Poor Pitiful Pearl in one hand and a fat cigar in the other will always be one of my most cherished memories . When Princess Grace employed me , she had warned that I would lead " a secluded life . " Actually my job took me many thousands of miles , to America and Greece and Ireland . America was a revelation to the children . They loved every moment of it , from expeditions into the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grace has a brother . Jack , and two sisters , Elizabeth and Peggy , who , between them , have a total of nine children . Caroline and Albert blended in with their American cousins perfectly , despite the difference of their upbringing . Caroline and Albert do not remember the late John Brendan Kelly , but they love his widow , their grandmother . Like Princess Grace and Prince Rainier , they  | call her " Ma Kelly . " While we were staying with her , she insisted that Caroline and Albert take a tour of Philadelphia and personally showed them Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell . Prince Rainier and Princess Grace enjoyed their state visit to Ireland so much that , at its conclusion , they called me and told me to bring the children over for a private holiday . Our first stop was London . As we descended the gangway , flash bulbs went off and television cameras whirred . Caroline , who was just at the age when she was beginning to realize that she was a young princess , turned to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to take pictures of me . " I had to do some quick thinking to keep her modest . " The photographers are here because this is my country , " I told her . Caroline brooded for a while , then said , " But why ? You are Nana of Monaco , not Nana of England . " But , in Cork , Caroline and Albert got back at me . One evening I heard a tumult outside the hotel . From time to time a great shout arose , and finally I went up to the children 's apartment to investigate . I discovered my young charges , clad in pajamas , at the window , delightedly waving to the crowd below , who were cheering back at them . The children and the crowd could have kept it up all night . Finally , in desperation . I appealed to the Prince : " Your Highness , could you and the Princess appear at the window and show yourselves to the people ? Otherwise we wo n't get any sleep . " They obliged with good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire Grimaldi family , and a peaceful night was had by all . Another trip we all enjoyed was the yearly expedition to the Swiss Alps , where the Prince rented a chalet from February to the end of March . The Prince is a superb skier , but when Princess Grace began lessons he stayed with her on the beginner 's slope , which the Swiss traditionally call " Idioten Hugel " or " Idiot Hill . " The children , too , received instruction in both skiing and ice skating , almost as soon as they could walk . The Prince loves sports and is an expert skin diver , swimmer and sailor . The Princess herself never goes diving , but she swims beautifully . She also likes to loll around on the surface of the water , floating on an inflated inner tube or on a pneumatic mattress . This of course gave rise to a wonderful game for the children . They would swim quietly to the mattress , dive under it and push up , rolling Her Serene Highness into the cool water among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , was also fair game for their mischief , especially on Saturday night , which was " tickling night . " Right after dinner , Caroline and Albert would take off , screaming like a tribe of Sioux on the warpath : " Nana , you 're fat ! " My job was to tear after them , catch them and tickle them until they surrendered in fits of laughter , attest-  | ing " Nana , you 're thin ! " This dashing and yelling would go on from the dining room to the salon to the bedroom to the nursery and back , while the Prince and Princess tried to watch television and concentrate on the news . I must say that they never objected to these loud carryings-on . There is always a security guard on duty outside the nursery . When I wanted to go out with the children , we could not just walk out of the door . I had to call the colonel of the guard for a plainclothes man to accompany us . Sometimes , even a colorfully uniformed palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albert . The palace security force has a special problem , for the whole of the rock of Monaco , on which the palace is built , is honeycombed by secret passages and tunnels . These date back to medieval times , when the rulers of the rock often had to make a hasty escape from attacking forces . Once , during my years in Monaco , an alarm ? " Strangers in the palace " ? was sounded , but I was never told whether the intruders were caught . I do know that , as a result of this mysterious incident , the palace guard was doubled . And from that day onward I redoubled my vigilance over the children . Of course , life in the palace was not always that exciting . Nevertheless , breakfast was usually a rousing occasion . On schooldays the children rushed whooping into the bedroom of the Prince and Princess at 7:30 A.M. Albert nearly always wore his cowboy holster and some of the toy six-shooters in his collection . The Prince had to wake up so that Albert could point his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to lie back and play dead . Breakfast was a family affair in the library . The Princess nibbled at some toast and had tea and orange juice . The Prince enjoyed a hearty English-style breakfast of eggs and bacon . He liked to cook them himself , so the valets wheeled in a trolley equipped with an electric frying pan and a toaster . Sometimes , dressed in his chef uniform , Albert helped his father . The family got together again before dinner . The children played in their parents ' rooms and sometimes we all ate together in the private dining room . In that case Albert would sometimes help the valets set table . He became quite skilled at this , and one day , when I asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up , he said proudly , " A valet , of course ! " When there were no guests or other obligations , the Prince and Princess liked to retire after dinner to a cozy little room furnished like an old English pub . It was there , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children and we would all toast marshmallows , roast chestnuts and sing Christmas carols . As an added attraction , the Princess would sometimes favor us with a rendition of the songs she used to sing as a young girl at camp . They were full of exhortations to do " everything together , forever . " The children were in raptures over these American togetherness tunes , but the Prince and I would have fits of giggles , and the Princess would send us out of the room to prevent further interruptions . What is Princess Grace really like ? After spending seven years with her , I think that I know her , and this knowledge has brought a great admiration . On first meeting her , some people are misled by her cool blonde beauty . They do not realize the warmth and love that are in her . I have seen her walk with her husband hand in hand in the garden , and they made a picture of vibrant happiness . Sometimes I found them sitting close together on the sofa in the salon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is extremely sensitive . Once she was unable to hide her grief from the children . This occurred last year when Prince Pierre , her beloved father-in-law , died . When the sad news arrived , the children were in school . The Princess hurried over to tell them and brought them back with her . When I arrived to express my condolences , she was holding Caroline and Albert close to her , and crying . Of course , she can also radiate great happiness , and she is most demonstrative . When she returned from trips , for example , there was great hugging and kissing , and I came in for my share . Surprisingly , too , for a former film star and a sovereign princess , Her Highness is extremely modest . I remember once when we were in Paris , she wanted to have her hair done . Instead of summoning the hairdresser to her apartment , as many ladies of her rank might have done , she asked for an appointment . " What time would suit Your Highness ? " she was asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she replied with charming but natural simplicity . The Princess pays as much attention to what the children wear as to her own clothes . Her mother , Mrs. Kelly , sends practical play clothes from the States : blue jeans , colorful sports shirts and sports shoes . Albert gets some smart suits from England with well-tailored jackets . Caroline 's dresses are usually made or bought in Monaco , except for the dress she received as a gift from  | Monsieur Givenchy . This was created for her by the famous couturier while he was designing some clothes for her mother . As they grew up , I gradually helped the children transfer their full loyalty to the Princess . As decisions in their young lives had to be made , for example , I would tell them , " First we must ask Mummy . " And when they hurt themselves badly , I would call the Princess . She would come rushing up , cradle them in her arms and croon , " I 'll kiss it and make it better . " The children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little , they learned to take falls and knocks without tears . The Princess and I taught them to do so by not making a fuss about small accidents . When they fell down , we would smile and say , " Get up and let 's see if you 've cracked the floor , " and they would laugh with us . When there were tears , we knew that the pain was bad , and they would get the necessary affection . There was never any conflict of authority between the Prince , the Princess and myself . When I was with the children , it was up to me to impose the necessary discipline , and if they were naughty , I had to punish them . Penalties included sitting still in a nursery chair for five long minutes , or , for more serious infractions , being barred from watching television . To begin with , television was severely rationed by the Prince and Princess and was largely confined to the children 's hour on weekends . Missing that was a big disappointment . Once when Albert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my bedroom , he quietly wandered off . I soon found him sitting at his daddy 's side ? watching the other set in the library . I explained my ban to the Prince , who unhesitatingly leaned forward and switched the set off . Father and son then looked at each other glumly ? both deprived of that evening 's entertainment . Sometimes when the children had been particularly rude or cheeky , the Prince took the law into his own hands . I remember once that Albert turned to me and said , " You 're not the boss here ! " Before I could say anything , Prince Rainier was giving him a sound spanking . The children usually responded to reprimand except in one puzzling case . This was when Caroline developed the deplorable habit of biting Albert . He took these attacks with remarkable stoicism , and never complained to me . But one night , when I was bathing him , I noticed that his back and sh.oulda-s were black and blue with Caroline 's teeth marks . I tried to cure her of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to consult with Princess Grace , who also tried to stop these painful antics . She , too , was unsuccessful . We put our heads together and the Princess ordered me to bring Caroline to her apartment . " You must not bite your brother , " Princess Grace said . " It hurts . " Then , to dem-  | onstrate her point , she advanced and bit her daughter firmly on the arm . It worked . Caroline , at nine , is an unusually attractive girl , and will probably grow up to become as dazzling a beauty as her mother . She combines the Princess ' fine classic features with the warm Mediterranean vivacity of her father . She has deep blue eyes like both her mother and father , and long dark hair of which she is already very proud . She has now got into the habit of combing and brushing it carefully every evening . Both Caroline and Albert love music . Twice a week , Caroline goes to the ballet school of Madame Besobrasova , and , after two years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She also knows how to do the Twist , though I do n't know where she picked that up . Until two years ago , both children went to a small school that had been organized for them at the palace . But then the Prince and Princess decided that Caroline should go to a regular school and mix with more children of her age . She was enrolled in the Convent School of Les Dames de St. Maur ( The Sisters of Saint Maur ) . The relationship between Caroline and Albert is a very close one , fostered by the Prince and Princess . Caroline still has a protective attitude toward her brother , even though she is only a year older . And when Stephanie was expected , her motherly feelings were immediately enlisted to the extent , even , that , in talking to her mother , she began referring to the expected arrival as " our baby . " Albert was a little more cautious . Shortly before the birth , I found him in the nursery storing his prized toys under his bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquired . Albert said cautiously , " I 'm putting some of my things out of the way ? in case the baby steps on them . " Later , he became convinced that the new baby would be a boy . He got a huge plastic pistol , ready to press it into the child 's hands the moment it was born ! It is Caroline , though , who figures in one of my most amusing memories . The incident occurred when the Prince and Princess arranged a reception for President de Gaulle at the Legation of Monaco in Paris . Before the event , I rehearsed Caroline in the proper form of address for the French president : Votre Excellence ? Your Excellency . Shortly before , however , she had met the white-bearded , purple-robed Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church , Eugene Cardinal Tisserant , for whom the correct greeting is the even more august Votre Eminence . When it came her turn to greet President de Gaulle , she curtsied beautifully and said clearly , " Votre Excellence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure , " Votre Eminence " ! It was the only time I ever saw a great grin spread over the usually stern face of General de Gaulle . The arrival of the new baby made a change in all our lives . Princess Grace was active right up to the day of Stephanie 's birth . That very morning ? the first day of February last year ? her mother , Mrs. John B. Kelly , was due in from Philadelphia to be with her daughter during the birth . Princess Grace slipped into her car and drove the winding road to Villefranche to meet her . Mother and daughter had lunch together , but , not long after , it was evident that little Stephanie was . about to arrive . The birth , like those of Caroline and Albert , was easy . It took place at 5 P.M. in the palace library , which had been converted into a delivery room by removing the toys , parcels and records that usually cluttered it and by hanging white sheets on the walls . The Prince sent me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Princess Grace was in bed in her room with Stephanie in a crib beside her . Members of the family were gathered around , and champagne was flowing freely . The children were a little intimidated by the commotion , and peered into the crib without saying anything . By that time , the cannons on the ramparts were starting to boom their salute , and Albert began to count the number of rounds , ticking them off on his little fingers . " What are you doing ? " I asked . " I 'm counting the rounds , " he replied . " Why ? " I asked , knowing perfectly well the answer I would get . " Girls only get a 21-gun salute ? I got a hundred and one ! " Caroline wanted to bathe the baby immediately and suggested firmly that Stephanie would be better off in a doll 's cradle she has next to her bed than in a crib beside her mother . Albert , once he was satisfied with the salute , and seeing that Stephanie was not of a size to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring them out and show them to her . Naturally , their enthusiasm had to be restrained a little , but the Princess made a point of encouraging them to participate in taking care of Stephanie . A bath , for example , became a kind of communal affair . Albert would draw the water , while Caroline was preparing the clean clothes . From time to time Caroline had a turn at giving the baby her bottle , while Albert made encouraging comments from the sidelines . Both children got to hold the baby ; they were firmly ensconced on a sofa where there was no chance of dropping her . I would sit and watch them while Stephanie 's Swiss nurse supervised the operation . I realized that the time had come for me to go . Caroline and Albert were old enough to take care of themselves . The longer I waited , the more difficult the parting would be both for them and for myself . I had broached the subject of my leaving to the Princess several months before , and though we were both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I considered my personal life . My stay with the Grimaldi family had been glamorous and exciting . I had met kings , queens , presidents , film stars and the warmhearted people of Monaco . But in the midst of all the glamour , I was sometimes lonely . There were not many people of my age around . The time had come for me to return to a world I had left seven years ago . I volunteered to stay , however , until Princess Stephanie was born and Caroline and Albert had happily adjusted to accepting her into their little realm . I also put off my departure in order to postpone the moment of separation between Caroline and Albert and myself . During the seven years I lived with them , I had come to love them as if they were my own , and I know they returned this love . When the day of my departure came , Caroline , Albert and I moped around the nursery . Word came that the chauffeur was waiting . I sadly kissed the children and walked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretended to be fixing it . Caroline retired to a corner near her doll 's house and picked up a big picture book . As I turned back for a last look , all I could see was a delicate little hand raised above the volume hiding her face . She was waving good-bye to me and saying softly , " Au revoir , Nana , au revoir . " Since then I 've received a letter from Caroline . " Dear Nana , " she wrote , " Albert and I miss you very much . We are all being very good and we often think of you . Come back soon . Love , Caroline , Albert and Stephanie . " I ca n't go back , of course . That part of my life ? and of theirs ? is over . But the years I spent in the loving household of Prince Rainier and Princess Grace and their children will always be among my most cherished memories .                    @
