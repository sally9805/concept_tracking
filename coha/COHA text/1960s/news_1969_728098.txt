txt The labor pinch is on . So serious is the shortage of workers in the Soviet economy that planners are being forced to consider new reforms and to come to grips with that frustrating problem  --  worker efficiency . Until now , the Russians have achieved industrial growth by building more and more factories and pouring in more and more workers , including women , to run them . Now , say Western experts , the economy is reach ' ing a point where it is no longer possible to waste labor . The Soviet industrialists must learn to be more effiCient with what they have . ? The cry of " no workers " is heard everywhere . From Khabarovsk in the east to Riga in the west , , mayors , factory mariagers , and republic Offidials complain about the problem : In Leningrad . and Moscow . machine 's often stand idle because there is no one to man them . . ? ? . Reasons identified A high:leVel government official now states that industry in the huge Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Konstantin A. N ? vikov , chairman of the federation'i State Labor Resources Committee , cites these reasons for the mounting shortage : . ? The total number of people put to work is groWing faster than the overall poO1 of employable labor . In 19661970 the number of workers and employees will have increased 2.4 percent while the labor force will have grown only 1.3 percent . ? It is no longer possible to hire housewives and persons engaged in private farming . In 1966-1968 more than 60 percent of all new capital investments were made in small and medium-sized towns , which drew on this source of labor . Now the source has virtually dried up . ? The flow of workers from agriculture to industry has declined . This is due to the expansion of agricultural production and to the fact that the earnings of.farmers are being increased at a faster rate than for other cate gories of workers . ? * Please . turn to Page 6 *Manpower squeeze besets Soviet industry // ?

It , increased by 1.2 million in 1966-1967 . ? Finally , there is inefficient use of labor in various industries and regions and no flexible system for shifting and retraining workers . Birthrate declines Demographic trends compound the concern , writes Mr. Novikov in the latest issue of the party journal Kommunist . The birthrate in the Russian federation declined from 24.2 per 1,000 population in 1958 to 14.2 in 1968 . This , of course , will affect future growth of the labor pool . As partial solutions to the labor problem , Mr. Novikov suggests the enlistment of retired persons ( there were 8.2 million as of Jan. 1 , 1969 ) and better training and placement of young people . But the brunt of his message is that industry much look for reserves within its own backyard . It is necessary , he says , especially in such labor-short areas as Siberia and the Far East , to get rid of superfluous workers and redistribute them throughout industry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worker must be encouraged to work more efficiently and the redundant worker moved to new slots . On this score , Mr. Novikov faults the new . economic reform instituted in 1967 as not giVing factories an incentive to reduce the number of workers . On the contrary , he ' states flatly , " Enterprises that have introduced technical ' or organizational innovations which make it possible to free workers are in no hurry to do so . " Incentive system pushed As a way out of the quandary , Mr. Novikov lends his influential voice of support to the so-called " Shchekino experiment , " an incentive system that is fast gaining prominence here . Only recently a high official of the Latvian S.S.R. told this correspondent Latvia plans to introduce the system throughout its industry . First introduced in 1967 at the Shchekino Chemical Combine in Tula Province , the experiment now is being tried at about 20 enterprises in the Soviet Union . Under the system , a factory 's wage fund is centrally fixed at a given sum for a period of years . The manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulate higher labor productivity . He may , for instance , dismiss a number of workers , even engineers , and pay the remainder higher wages for producing more , taking on added responsibility , and so forth . Workers released At Shchekino more than 800 workers have been released , including 200 engineers , and although no output or labor prOductivity figures have been published the results are reported to be good . The obvious problem that arises under the Shchekino system is what to do with the redundant workers who have been dismissed . For ideological reasons Communist planners eschew the term " unemployment " and in fact boast that only the U.S.S.R. and the Soviet-bloc countries enjoy full employment . Shchekino is not really a full-blown experiment , since the majority of workers have been given other jobs within the enterprise , which was planning to expand its operations anyway . Indirectly , Mr. Novikov suggests accept . ance of the concept of a temporarily unemployed segment of workers , although he does not use the term . He urges , for instance , that the responsibility for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to labor agencies . At present , because factories must find jobs for dis- missed workers they simply do not bother reducing their work force . The Soviet labor expert also advocates that redundant workers to be dismissed be included in current and long-range plans so that housing , services , reemployment , and job training can be planned . Finally , he suggests the establishment of special benefits that would sufficiently compensate a worker for lost , time and encourage him to change jobs . In a capitalist society , such as the United States , a worker being retrained . is listed as " unemployed . " Mr. Novikov also lauds the work of local job-placement agencies in the Russian federation , which in 1968 listed 900,000 job vacancies and received 600,000 inquiries . He adds that in the near future it is planned , where expedient , to set up job-placement bureaus in cities of more than 100,000 population . There are 30 such bureaus in the federation at present . A need for manpower redistribution has been pointed up by other Soviet officials as well . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special law that would guarantee the dismissed worker his job rank and average wage during retraining , housing at his new place of work , etc.
