The U.S. textile industry last week laid before the Tariff Commission a country-by-country quota-protection program to offset the flood of foreign cotton imports . Bruised by competition from abroad , domestic cotton manufacturers recommended that each foreign country be limited to the volume of its 1955 cotton exports to the U.S. Otherwise , U.S. textile producers will be placed in the position where they will have to establish overseas plants to take advantage of less expensive foreign manufacturing facilities . <P> Millowners claim that such protection is necessary because they are unable to compete with cheap foreign labor , are also being undercut by the U.S. Government , which sells surplus raw cotton to foreign manufacturers at cut-rate prices in order to meet world prices . Domestic producers can not buy this surplus on world cotton markets , are compelled by law to purchase artificially supported U.S.-grown cotton , which sells for 8 per pound more . This has helped foreign textile products to undersell domestic cloth goods , foreign textile manufacturers to increase textile exports to the U.S. by more than 550% since 1948 . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the problem of the State Department 's free trade stand v. the Agriculture Department 's farm price supports , which encourage farmers to grow so much cotton that the huge surplus must be dumped on the world market . Last week the Department of Agriculture , which by law must make the U.S. cotton surplus available to world markets at competitive prices , asked the Tariff Commission for an 8 per lb. duty on cotton imports . Such a tariff would make up the gap between the low cost of raw cotton on the world market and the Government-supported prices that domestic mills must pay . <P> In addition , the tariff request is expected to run into a storm of opposition from the State Department . State Department officials have argued that protection would cripple the development of underdeveloped countries for whom textile goods are the staple export , said that the U.S. must support free trade to maintain better markets for her exports . Cracked an Agriculture Department official : " We 're interested in the American people , and State 's interested in foreigners . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
