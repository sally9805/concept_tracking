THE THIN RED LINE ( 495 pp. ) - James Jones-Scribners ( $5.95 ) . <P> BIG SUR ( 241 pp. ) - Jack Kerouac-Farrar , Straus &; Cudahy ( $4.50 ) . <P> America 's once promising crop of young postwar writers has so far shown no knack at all for growing old great-fully . Critics , casting about for the causes of failed promise , justly note a complex of external factors : the loss of old , stable values once held in common between readers and writer ; the absence of a society sufficiently established to provide the potential novel ist with a rich background of mores and customs for his characters . But much of the trouble is internal . So few younger novelists age well these days because so many of them have difficulty in growing up at all . <P> No sadder cases in point can be cited than James ( From Here to Eternity ) Jones and Jack ( On the Road ) Kerouac . <P> Each was once hailed , with a certain jus tice , as a literary lion cub whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contemporary U.S. <P> fiction . Yet today , four books and some 2,700 pages later . James Jones , at 42. looks more and more like a one-shot author . And irrepressible Jack Kerouac , 40. twelve volumes and some 2,200 pages from his first success , seems a confirmed one-vein literary minor . <P> Dirty Deal . Philosophically , Jones has always been that most tiresome of fel lows , a proudly ignorant cynic who is convinced that the inscrutably stacked deck of the universe will always produce a dirty deal . But as a writer , at least in Eternity , he had rare storytelling power . Prizes ( the 1952 National Book Award ) and plenty of cash ( mainly from Hollywood ) gave Jones a mobility he might have used to grow beyond his army themes . Unhappily his latest book . The Thin Red Line , like those preceding it , has not reached out to new subjects or ideas . Instead , it turns back again to the army-still , apparently , the only world Jones knows-to document the complete experience of his infantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Ex-Private Jones 's long , hard-written effort to be the Marcel Proust of C-for-Charlie Company 's baptism of fire is not without virtues . His narrative of the company 's action switches focus from soldier to soldier , skillfully managing to re-create a steadily developing , complex assault on a pair of Japanese-held hills . Without seeming to interrupt , it examines each individual 's reactions to his own private world of pride and fear . But much of what Jones tells of the men-their need to prove their manhood , the revival meeting frenzy that carries them forward , the nearly insane numbness that battle finally brings them-has been touched on often before . <P> Locked into his peculiarly American narrative style ( it might well be called " feces on the barroom floor realism " ) , Jones ends by piling grisly detail upon grisly detail without being wise or eloquent enough to give the accumulation shape or meaning . He exposes nothing even vaguely profound about the company 's inner experience , and most of the time seems hardly more articulate about emotions than the poor numbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
