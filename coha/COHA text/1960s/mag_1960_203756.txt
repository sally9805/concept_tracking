Who wants 24 ninth-graders ? They graduated last June from George Washington Carver Elementary School in suburban Detroit 's Royal Oak Township ( pop . 8,000 ) . * Last week every high school in the area refused to accept them . It was not just that the youngsters are Negroes ; they also happen to be products of a black hell of vice and corruption . <P> The U.S. Government spawned present conditions in Royal Oak Township during <P> World War II , when it flung up flimsy barracks for Southern Negro defense workers . Today nearly half the population is on relief . Narcotics , robbery and corruption are common . Last winter Police Chief William Ware stole a Christ mas fund for underprivileged children . Township Supervisor Elwood Dickens ' saloon , the dirtiest in town , is a hangout for minors . Royal Oak Township 's rapes , burglaries and arson cases go uninvestigated . The township treasury has an unexplained shortage of $5,000 . <P> The township 's youngsters are not without promise . Not long ago one of them turned up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adelaide Long has her troubles . A cinder-block monstrosity , the school bears knife scars from floors to ceilings . Insurance companies have given up on the windows : last year the kids broke $3,000 worth , and this year Principal Long is converting to plywood . <P> Until last year , Carver 's graduates went on to Detroit high schools as tuition students . As the schools grew more crowded . Detroit grew more weary of Royal Oak Township 's youngsters . Moreover , the Carver school district now owes Detroit $125,053.67 in back tuition . With one former superintendent having already looted school funds , Carver is in no position to pay . <P> After Detroit rejected tuition students , the Carver district 's school board appealed to the adjacent white suburbs . Ferndale , which already has a 10% Negro high school enrollment , had no qualms about turning down Carver graduates . Oak Park , a predominantly liberal Jewish community , suffered some embarrassment . In the end , Oak Park followed Ferndale . Only a nearby Roman Catholic parochial school . Our Lady of Victory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a high school . <P> Last week all sorts of experts were mulling over " long-range " solutions for Royal Oak Township 's problems . Some of them thought the place should be wiped out as a political entity . But no one had yet found a high school for Carver 's 24 ninth-graders . The only solution , it seemed , was to plunk them back in Carver and call one of its battered rooms a high school . <P> <P> *The half-square-mile remainder of a once larger township , which split up into such cities as Berkeley and nearby Royal Oak , where rabble-rousing Father Charles E. Coughlin made his radio tirades during the 19305.
