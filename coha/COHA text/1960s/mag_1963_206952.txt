On the tanbark trail , the top status symbol is a private stateroom in the circus train . The occupant is always a center-ring star . As Ringling Bros , and Barnum &; Bailey Circus last week moved out of winter camp just south of Sarasota , Fla. , and began its 93rd national tour , one stateroom was reserved for the youngest person ever to have one-an 18-year-old girl . <P> Her name is Vicki Unus , but she will be billed as La Toria as she spins in the air on the Roman rings . Her performance lasts seven minutes and occurs 32 ft. up , with no nets . For four minutes or so , she does such maneuvers as swings , splits , twists , roll-ups , hand stands , half crosses , and one-arm planches . <P> Seat Brusher . Then she goes into the grand finale of the golden rings , the one-arm swing . She hangs on with one hand while her body turns over and over itself like an eccentric propeller . She does it maybe 75 times , 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set the alltime record : 125 . <P> Vicki is the daughter of F. F. Unus , the man who stands on one finger . The Unuses , like most circus stars , live in Sarasota . In Sarasota , even the high school has a circus . Three years ago Vicki told her father that she wanted to perform . Vicki was 5 ft. 3 in. and 125 Ibs . Said her father , with a pro 's cold cynicism : " What will you do , brush off the seats ? " Vicki lost 10 Ibs. and went into training under the great Lalage , whose real name is Wolfgang Roth . <P> Word Eater . She worked seven days a week , three hours a day . Where others often get much of their training as apprentices performing in public , she held out until she had perfected herself to the caliber of the center ring . Carrying a large plumed fan and wearing golden shoes , she is the new star of the traditional aerial ballet-one of the circus ' four production numbers-and people of the circus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lillian Leitzel , who died 26 years ago in a fall in Copenhagen . <P> As a new face in the pin spots , she is part of a freshman class that includes East Germany 's Prince Von , who puts skates on his hands and glides down two wires from roof to floor , and Mexico 's Seor Antonio , the first aerialist in Ringling history to consent to do a hand stand while swinging on a trap bar at the top of the arena . As a child of the circus , Vicki Unus is proud to be La Toria and take her place among them - and among such old B. &B.; stars as Harold Alzana , the high wire king , Trevor Bale , the big cat man , the Flying Gibsons and the Hanneford Bareback Riders . But she is proudest of all to be in the same show with F. F. Unus , her father , who has long since outlasted all competition in the art of standing on one finger , but who has just been forced to learn how to eat his words .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
