txt The New York Court of Appeals has ruled that the police do not have to advise a suspect of his right to remain ! , silent and his right to have a lawyer before taking his confession . Legal observers consider the decision of great importance because the courts had appeared to be moving in the direction of requiring the police to inform suspects of their constitutional rights before questioning them . In fact , the California Supreme Court reversed a conviction in January because the ' defendant had not been told of his right to have a lawyer and his right to remain silent before confessing , Thus the two largest states in the country are in direct conflict on what lawyers agree to be one of the most important criminal-law questions of the . day . In the New York case , People v. Gunner , the defendant was convicted of murder in connection with the slaying of a store owner in Merrick , L. I. , on July 16 , 1962 . On the night of the murder/ the defendant , Douglas Mac- ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was arrested ! on July 18 by the Los Angeles police . He made a number of admissions to the California authorities before being brought to New York on July 22 . On July 19 , a day after his/ arrest , and after some of his confession had been taken by the police , a lawyer called the Chief of Police of Nassau County and told him he was representing Gunner and that he " did n't want any statements taken from him . " However , Gunner made more admissions to the crime , both on the plane coming here and in a police station in Nassau . The Court of Appeals ruled out all the statements made by Gunner to the police after his lawyer talked to the Nassau police chief . They therefore reversed the conviction and ordered a new trial . Court 's Position But the court said it would not extend its past rulings and hold inadmissible the confessions given before his lawyer made the phone call , even though the Los Angeles police admitted they had not told Gunner of his right to remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deciding , the court was not reversing itself . Contrary to popular opinion , the police in the past have not been obliged to inform a defendant of his right to remain silent or of his right to a lawyer . In a series of decisions since 1963 the Court of Appeals , has ruled out confessions where a suspect was refused permission to see a lawyer . These decisions were a distinct break with tradition and were criticized by law-enforcement officials mainly because of their future implications . For the same reason , a United States Supreme Court decision of June , 1964 , was hotly disputed by prosecutors throughout the country . The case , Escobedo v. Illinois , reversed a murder conviction because both the lawyer and suspect had been refused permission to see each other and the suspect had not been advised of his right to remain silent . It is in the interpretation of the Escobedo case that the confilet between New York and California lies . Since in Escobedo the lawyer was at the po- ' lice station attempting to see ; his client , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is unclear as to how far the Supreme Court meant the decision to go . California 's Supreme Court has said that the Escobedo case ! requires that a confession taken from an accused person who has ! , not been advised of his constitutional rights be excluded from ' evidence . The New York Court of Appeals has now interpreted that ' decision more strictly and limited it more closely to its facts . However , Judge Stanley Fuld , ' who wrote the decision In the ; Gunner case , said that he and Chief Judge Charles S. Desmond would have gone further and also excluded the statements made by the defendant before his lawyer communicated with the police . On this critical point the court split 5 to 2 against Gunner 's contentions . Nassau District Attorney William Cahn , whose office prosecuted Gunner , yesterday hailed the decision as an indication that " the pendulum may be swinging the other way ? to'wards protecting the rights of society . " Mr. Cahn said his office was concerned with the rights of the individual but that recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exclusion of the public welfare . " Edmond Allen Rosner , the lawyer who handled the appeal for Gunner , criticized the court for its " formalistic approach rather than a realistic approach " to the problem . Mr. Rosner said that a defendant 's constitutional rights should not have to depend on his making a request for counsel . Mr. Rosner pointed out , however , that the Court of Appeals , by ruling out all the admissions made by Gunner to the police after his lawyer had called Nassau authorities , had expanded the right to counsel as stated in previous decisions . I Thus , said Mr. Rosner , the ( court has scotched the idea that ; a lawyer must be physically /present in the police station to stop the police from effectively questioning his client . / The lawyer said he planned to seek review of the decision I by the United States Supreme ; Court , even though the New York court reversed the conviction .

It has not yet been published in the official law reports . On occasion the court does not immediately publish its opinion officially , so that it may later make certain changes in the language . Lawyers said yesterday , however , that substantial changes in the decisions are rarely made .
