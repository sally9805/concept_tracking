Letters to The Times Teacher Dispute Assessed Union Criticized for Its Threat of Civil Disobedience TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TINIER : Settlement of the teachers ' dispute points up important considerations . Many citizens sympathize with the desire of teachers for higher pay and better working conditions , but are disturbed by remarks of President Cogen of the United Federation of Teachers that he would conduct the strike from a cell . Disobedience to law should be the last resort of teachers . The U.F.T. is somewhat confused in seeking to use the philosophy of Thoreau and applying it to the current situation . To equate the problem of the Negro in the South who is deprived of his rights by those violating the law with that of a teacher who will deliberately violate the law to attain his goal borders on the ridiculous . Administrative officials should sit down with union representatives to discuss ways of doing a better job . No union has any right to dictate policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no matter how inadequate or ineffective he may be , he appoints the members of the Board of Education . They alone have the right to make policy . With vacations of 12 weeks , additional paid holidays and religious holidays , a reasonably short work day , pension and Social Security benefits and HIP. , our teachers are not grossly underpaid . When salary levels are brought to a maximum of $12,000 , considering all additional benefits which are theirs , teachers will be able to enjoy the fruits of their labors . They can always take promotion examinations if they desire to advance . The public schools are the core of a democratic society . The end has never justified the means . Teachers must take pride in doing what is right , even if it hurts . How do we change the patterns of our municipal jungle if teachers say " Do as I say , not as I do " ? LEO KLAUBER . New York , Sept. 10 , 1963 . Teacher 's Complaints Assailed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $7,000 a year who felt that he was " in a fringe area economically . " How can an income of $7,000 a year leave anyone in a " fringe area " ? It is this attitude of whining that makes it impossible for me to believe that teachers will ever be satisfied with any salary they receive . This teacher is able to supplement his $7,000 income by $2,000 a year . A gross of $9,000 is not a fringe income . The same article states that the teacher 's working day runs from 6:30 A.M. to 10 o'clock at night , It implies working hours similar to those in Chartist England . Many of us rise early and do not calculate our working day from 6 A.M. , but from the time we begin to work . And if the teacher in question wishes to take extra evening work , this is his affair . He has no right to imply that he 's finished with work at 10 P.M. when he 's out of school at 3 in the afternoon . In general , the tone of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teachers have said and done . They imply that they do lots of work at home . Nonsense ! I taught in New York public schools . Any teacher with any intelligence does all his paper work in class . I do not criticize their striking ( or threatening to strike ) . I do criticize their " holier than thou " attitude and their implication that they 're concerned with the needs of the children , while all their actions and statements show that they are concerned merely with the condition.of their pocketbooks . MORTIMER THEODORE COHEN . New York . Sept 9. 1963 . No-Strike ' Pledge Proposed TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TINIER : The recent controversy between the United Federation of Teachers and the Board of Education has raised several Issues whose resolution is of paramount importance to all of us as citizens , parents and taxpayers , especially in preventing the city from being threatened at regular intervals with an illegal teachers ' strike . Since neither legislative nor judicial rulings are considered binding by the U.F.T. , should not every teacher be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate dismissal for refusal ? Does a group of approximately 6,000 members of the 21,000 U.F.T. membership have the right to take action affecting not only its organization but 20,000 other teachers and one million school children and their parents ? If a representative of U.F.T. is to meet regularly with Dr. Galvin Gross , ' should not representatives of other teacher groups as well parent groups have the right to sit in at such meetings ? Would it not be advisable to replace the concept of collective bargaining within the school system with a permanent mediation board ? Is the spectacle seen on television of a howling , undisciplined mob the " public image " our teachers want to fix in the public mind ? And , finally , is it possible for the city to inform its taxpayers of the individual cost in increased taxes which its recent surrender to the U.F.T. means ? JOH N WILLIAM HARRIS . New York , Sept. 10 , 1963 . Divided Germany Backed Soviet Solution Removes Potential Source of War , It Is Argued To THE EDITOR OF THE Nina YORK TIMES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germanys " you reject . the concept of a permanently divided Germany and refer to a " final peace agreement " which one day will resolve the German question . Could you not make a more realistic appraisal of the question and of the solution offered by Russia ? Russia , invaded by Germany twice in 27 years , will not accept a solution of the German problem which might allow a third attempt at an eastern conquest . Germany unified on any basis will become the largest and most powerful state in Europe . The advantages of a permanently divided Germany to Russia and also to France are apparent . Would even a Communist dominated reunified Germany be any guarantee against a resurgence of German nationalism directed against Russia ? France , which can cooperate with a small Germany more or less as an equal in the Common Market , would either be forced to accept the status of a subordinate in any relationship with a great Germany , or abandon the hope of co. operation and seek an ally in the East . It would be unwise to upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since the United States can not abandon West Berlin , the three Germanys remains about tile only alternative . Principles of foreign policy should reflect the national interest . Such a division of Germany would resolve the Gerninq question and remove a potential source of conflict between the great powers . W. H. BITTEL . Oxford , England , Sept. 5 , 1963 . Cambodia 's Rift With Saigon To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMEh In The New York Times editorml of Sept. 2 your paper comments that the " Phnompenh-Saigon rift is significant as a development that will work to the advantage of the Communists . . . and will be rut to good propaganda use by the Vietcong and by North Vietnam . " We would like to emphasize that the Royal Cambodian Government can not be accused of contributing to the failure of the Saigon regime in its fight against Communism . Ali already very bad situation in South Vietnam has only been rendeiod worse by that regime 's barbarous ; attacks against the Buddhists . We would also like respectfully to advise you that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government to break off diplomatic relations with South Vietnam ( Aug. 27 ) , and President de Gaulle 's initiative to promote a neutralist Vietnam ( Aug. 29 ) . The decision of the Royal Cambodian Government was motive ed by the hard , cold facts as set out in its proclamation of Aug. 27 , which accused South Vietnam of crimes against the Cambodian people ; crimes against the Khmer community living in South Vietnam and finally crimes against the Vietnamese Buddhist community itself . NONG KIM xv . Ambassador of Cambodia . Washington , Sent , 9. 1963 . Teen-Ager on Vandalism TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Thirs : Fred Hechinger said in an article , " Affluent Delinquency Pall ern " ( Sept. 6 ) , that teen-agers know parents will pay for their destruction at parties . I agree with him . I am 15 and I believe that forcing the teen-agers involved to repair the damage , preferably with the physical aid of the parents , would be more of a deterrent and be more apt to be remembered by the teenagers and parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FREEDMAN , Albuquerque , N. M. , Sept. 7,1963.
