Looking for all the world like a buoy that sprouted wings , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 's Nimbus weather satellite last week soared into space from its pad at Point Arguello , Calif . The Nimbus program has already cost more than $100 million , but the price tag may be well worth it . The ninth weather eye to be orbited by the U.S. , the General Electric-built Nimbus is at once the biggest and most advanced weather satellite sent into space since Tiros I pioneered the use of satellites for meteorology more than four years ago . <P> Not at the Stars . Where Tiros was aimed uselessly out into space much of the time , Nimbus forever focuses earthward - the result of infra-red controls , which utilize warmth radiated from the earth to keep Nimbus pointed in the right direction . This alone means four to five times more cloud cover photographs . Nimbus ' size ( 830 lbs. ) is its greatest advantage , allowing room for a set of daylight cameras that take photos five times clearer than Tiros ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply transmitters with 450 watts of power v. 20 watts for Tiros . <P> Nimbus passes close to the earth 's poles instead of following an equatorial orbit as Tiros did , thus covers a new 1,500-mile-wide swath of the earth ev ery 100 minutes . Nimbus can photograph every square mile of earth twice a day ; special infra-red radiometers shoot " pictures " of the dark surfaces . <P> No Poles , No Deserts . Tiros has long proved the worth of a weather satellite by picking out the classic cyclonic shape of tropical storms , made history when it identified Hurricane Esther in 1961 several days before it would have been spotted by conventional means . But neither Tiros nor any other weather observer has ever been able to make regular and thorough weather observations of the poles , where scientists believe major influences on the world 's weather originate , the major deserts or the southern oceans . From its polar orbit , Nimbus will do all this-and more . <P> Pictures from one of Nimbus ' three camera systems can be used for weather forecasting by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; WLAC-TV in Nashville has already installed equipment that will permit it to pick up weather pictures when Nimbus is overhead . By week 's end Nimbus had snapped more than 2,000 pictures and transmitted them to NASA receiving stations at Gilmore Creek , Alaska , and Rosman , N.C. " I wo n't say that one Nimbus spacecraft does the work of thousands of ground-based stations , " said Nimbus Project Manager Harry Press . " But the potential of weather satellites is now precisely that . "
