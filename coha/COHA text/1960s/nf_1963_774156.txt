txt  | ricitic tendencies , he was also influenced to some extent by Kant . For example , he accepted the law of causality as a priori and transcendental and not demonstrable from anything else.21 Causality was not a law of nature but a regulative principle which guides the scientist in comprehending phenomena . how he related his empirical position to space perception is considered later . ( See page 256 . ) Life and General Scientific Endeavors of Helmholtz Hermann Ludgwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz22 was born in Potsdam , Germany , in 1821 . His father taught in the Gymnasium of that city , and , because of his son 's delicate health , at first tutored him at home ; at the age of nine the boy entered the Gymnasium , proceeding so rapidly as to graduate at seventeen . Lacking the financial means to study physics , an already formed major interest , Helmholtz continued his studies at the Medico-Chirurgical Friedrich-Wilhelm Institute in Berlin where no tuition was charged those promising to serve as surgeons in the army upon graduating . Although Helmholtz was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its Professor of Physiology , was the teacher that had the most profound effect upon him during these student days . Students under Muller , who became his friends , included DuBois-Reymond , Virchow , and Brucke . They all admired Muller immensely , but he was of an older generation and , although he had helped to win physiology away from the philosophy of nature , still held to the prevailing vitalistic theory of biological activity . This his students could not accept . The spirit of their attitude is caught in a solemn oath that Brucke and DuBois Reymond imposed upon themselves during their student days , pledging to prove and expound the principle that " No other forces than common physical chemical ones are active within the organism . " 23 Such was the temper of these young scientists , all under thirty , which Helmholtz shared . Shortly after graduation in 1842 Helmholtz became an army surgeon at Potsdam . While carrying on his duties with the military , he continued his studies in physics and mathematics , and wrote and published several papers . Already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming evident . In 1847 , less than five years after his graduation , Helmholtz , a twenty-sixyear-old army surgeon , read before the Physical Society of Berlin his classic paper on the indestructibility of energy , giving mathematical formulation to the law of conservation . A few years earlier in 1842 , Julius Mayer ( 1814-1878 ) had published a theoretical paper on the topic , along with the method for calculating the dynamical equivalent of heat . J. I ' . Joule , almost immediately after Mayer , published the experiments of several years which he had con-  | ducted and which led to a theory substantially similar to Mayer 's . Controversy about priority sprang up . Helmholtz freely acknowledged their priority . All of these men deserve credit , Mayer more for the theoretical formulation , Helmholtz more for its mathematical statement , and Joule more for its research verification . It is worthy of remark that this paper by Helmholtz was in the spirit of that oath taken by his friends a few years before , since the theory of the conservation of energy is simultaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the substitution for it of the physical and chemical analysis of energy transformation . After serving in the army for five years and after a short stint as instructor in anatomy at a Berlin art school , Helmholtz was called to Konigsberg as Associate Professor of Physiology . Since he had a reasonably secure position , he married . He then turned to what proved to be his second major contribution , the measurement of the speed of the neural impulse , a topic to which we shall return presently . During these years he also worked in physiological optics . In 1851 he invented the ophthalmoscope , which was a concave mirror with a small hole in the middle through which the observer looked as he reflected light into the eye of the patient . Once conceived , this relatively simple device to look into the eye itself was of enormous value in research and medical practice . In 1856 the first volume of the Handbuch der physiologischen Optik appeared , with the last of its three volumes to appear ten years later ; and then issued as a unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it25 was translated into English , not just as a classic , but as an indispensable tool for the serious student of vision . In 1855 Helmholtz went to Bonn as Professor of Anatomy and Physiology . While still at Konigsberg he had become interested in acoustics . During his three years at Bonn , his first major research on hearing was carried out . In 1858 , during the period in which he centered his attention on acoustical problems , he moved to an even more important position in the German university system , the Professorship of Physiology at Heidelberg , a chair he occupied until 1871 . If anything , his already tremendous productivity increased during this period . In addition to the research on audition relevant to this particular account , Ile showed a remarkable ability to come to grips with important and crucial problems in hydrodynamics and electrodynamics . He ranged over many areas . The titles of some of his papers between 1858 and 1871 were on such topics as after-images , color blindness , the Arabian-Persian musical scale , relation between the natural sciences and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the movements of the human eye , the regulation of ice , the axioms ( if geometry , try , and hav lever . I Iis acoustical researches culminated on the  | appearance of On the Sensations of Tone in 1863.26 Just as did his book on vision , this new book summarized not only his investigations , but sifted , summarized , and systematized the entire available literature . During this period , honors were showered on him , invitations to lecture , calls from foreign countries , and the Prorektorship of the University of Heidelberg among them . In 1870 , when Helmholtz was fifty years of age , the chair in physics at the University of Berlin became vacant and he was asked to set his own conditions of acceptance . He asked for and received a salary of 4,000 thalers ( a huge sum for that day ) , a promise of a new institute of physics , its directorship and living quarters in that institute . Until arriving at Berlin in 1871 , Helmholtz had been somewhat cramped for space and limited as to apparatus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new Physics-Technical Institute at Charlottenberg , near Berlin , while still retaining his professorship . Such were his interests in espousing empiricism that during the period extending from 1866-1894 , he published five papers on geometrical axioms with the intention of showing , contrary to Kant , that they , too , are products of experience . He did his job so well that his discussion of non-Euclidian space made those who came after him cite his work as evidence for a ( nonexperiential ) fourth dimension . A bizarre consequence of this work was the support some contemporaries thought it gave to spiritualism . The American medium , Slade , had been performing such feats as seeming to remove objects from sealed boxes . From this a fuzzy explanation in terms of the fourth dimension became popular . It was argued that Slade 's feats were capable of performance because he worked in the " fourth dimension " where it would be as easy to remove an object from a sealed box as it was in the world of three dimensions to lift an object out of a square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany hotly and acrimoniously debated . In the course of this Helmholtz was blamed for creating a scientific scandal . Such was the passion aroused that one professor was dismissed from Berlin because of his accusations against Helmholtz . Although he continued his interests in physiological problems , revised his books on hearing and vision , and made that spirited defense of empiricism mentioned earlier , his researches during these years tended to center uu problems of physics less close to present interests . For example , he helped to direct his pupil , Hertz , to the problems which made a crucial contribution to the founding of wireless telegraphy and radio . He developed popular and elaborate lecture dennonstrat ions and continued to give scientific lectures designed to be of popular nature of which a total  | of four different collections appeared in print . In 1877 academic freedom was the basis of one of his popular lectures in which the " admirable " state of German universities , where , having thrown off the yoke of the Church , its professors taught unhindered , was contrasted with the lowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1893 Helmholtz came to the United States for the first and only time to attend the Chicago World 's Fair as a delegate from Germany . While returning , he had a severe fall down the ship 's stairs from which he never fully recovered . He died from a cerebral hemorrhage in September 1894 . The Speed of the Neural Impulse As expressed by J. Miiller , 27 the scientific opinion prevailing before the research of Helmholtz was either that the speed of the neural impulse was instantaneous or at least so fast as to be incapable of measurement . Estimates of speeds many times the velocity of light had been secured by assuming that the rate of flow of " animal spirits " would be similar for vessels of the same size and that speed varied inversely with the diameter of the conductor . Since the diameters of nerve fibers were very , very minute , indications of tremendous speeds were obtained . The method used by Helmholtz , 28 which would have been entirely inadequate had the previous estimates been true , was to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the so-called nervemuscle preparation , and arrange it so that both the moment of stimulation and the resultant movement would be recorded on a drum revolving at a known speed . Helmholtz measured the time between stimulation and the muscle twitch for different lengths of nerve . The difference in time interval between stimulation of the nerve near the muscle and its recorded reaction and that for stimulation far from the muscle gave him the time taken for passage . Since he knew the distance between the points of stimulation , he could now calculate its speed per second . Helmholtz found the speed to be the very modest one of about ninety feet per second . The Bell-Magendie law , which distinguished between sensory and motor nerves , made it unsafe for him to leave the problem measured with motor nerves alone , so he now turned to sensory-motor nerves to find out whether their speed was similar or different . He also turned to human subjects . When stimulated on the toe and on the thigh , a man can respond with his hand . The difference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the two instances gave Helmholtz his measure of speed of reaction ? something between fifty and l00 feet per second , but variability from  | trial to trial and subject to subject was so great that he did not follow up the original study . The individual differences , later to become so important in themselves , were , for Helmholtz , nothing more than an indication of inadequate control , as indeed they turned out to be . Nevertheless these two phases of the study gave him rough measures of the speed of sensory and motor neural impulses . In general , later , more accurate research has demonstrated that the neural impulse varies enormously . The speeds , Helmholtz found , proved to be too slow . Nevertheless it was Helmholtz who carried out the pioneer study . The fact that the nervous impulse is not instantaneous but takes appreciable amounts of time signified that mental events were definitely limited by the properties of the body and that an analysis of bodily motion was relevant to psychological phenomena . Mental events that seem instantaneous may actually be temporal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . it brought the soul to time .... " 29 This was the first " reaction-time " study as it came to be called . However , Helmholtz was interested only in the sheer speed of the neural impulse , and it was the work of Donders published some fifteen years later ( already described ) which showed a grasp of the psychological significance of the problem . Vision While integrating the previously available research in the field of visual physiology , Helmholtz also did an enormous amount of original and important work which is presented in his Handbuch der physiologischen Optik.30 The three volumes have been characterized respectively as physiological , sensory , and perceptual accounts of vision.31 Some of his own specific research studies show a similar affinity to psychological problems . He measured the optical constants of the eye , demonstrated how the eye accommodates for different distances , and developed and supported by research a theory of visual space . Most important of all was his theory of color vision . As early as 1802 , Thomas Young ( 1773-1829 ) had published a theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is equipped with three kinds of color sensitive points.32 These three primary colors , working cooperatively , were said to furnish the range of experienced colors . The derivation of all colors from a limited number of colors was not new , as we know from Newton . ( Sec page 177 . ) Going beyond Newton , Young 's contribution was the suggestion of a physiological basis of three kinds of " particles on the retina , "  | ( receptors ) each kind acting independently . This suggestion lay fallow until Helmholtz espoused the theory , to be known thereafter as the Young-Helmholtz theory of color vision . In Helmholtz 's theory three sets of fibers in the retina are said to give rise respectively to sensations of red , green , and violet.33 There are supposed to be three kinds of photo-chemically decomposible substances in the end organs , each with different degrees of sensitiveness to different parts of the visible spectrum . With disintegration of these substances , neural excitation occurs . The three kinds of excitation act differently on the brain only because , while playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different functioning parts of the brain . Using these particulars of receptor and cerebral localization , Helmholtz then proceeded to suggest how they could be used to explain various psychological visual experiences . On stimulation of the red and green fibers together , yellow results . Other combinations produce other colors . When all three kinds of organs are stimulated in the right proportion , white results . Negative after-images on looking at a white surface , after colored stimulation , arise because after one of the organs have been thoroughly fatigued by use , we see with the unfatigued organs alone . Color blindness ( red-green blindness ) could result from lack of either red or green organs , or both . An objection to the theory that arose from critics was that yellow , postulated as arising from stimulation of red and green organs , should not be seen by color-blind individuals , whereas actually they can see yellow . In spite of criticism , modification , elaboration , and correction , the Young-Helmholtz theory is still taken very seriously today . Helmholtz34 held that this color theory is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific energy of nerves , with " three nerve systems . " Muller himself had applied the principle of the specific energy of nerves to the differentiation of one sense from another , but not to the separate qualities within a single sense , such as sweet and sour or red and green . Helmholtz was applying the rule within a single sense modality . If we speak of Muller 's theory as one of specific nerve energies , then Helmholtz was advancing a theory of specific fiber energies.35 Although Helmholtz did much to advance this theory of fiber energies , he had been anticipated by several other investigators , including Thomas Young himself who , by advancing his theory of specificity for different color qualities , anticipated Muller 's more general doctrine . Despite his citing Miller , the theory of Helmholtz turned out to be more a doctrine of the specific energies of cortical areas than it slid of nerves . As we know , the cortical area alternative had been raised , but not accepted by Muller . In the location of specificity , later research was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpreting space perception , Helmholtz was also an empiricist . Here he saw as his opponent , Ewald Hering , 36 who held that every point on the retina was innately capable of perceiving height , breadth , and depth . In part , Helmholtz defended an empirical position by use of Mailer 's doctrine of specific energies.37 Helmholtz held thafthe various sense organs and nerves each have characteristic qualities , which are not , in themselves , meaningful , being bare sense impression . At this point experience enters , for recurring association gives them meaning.38 The doctrine of specific nerve energies interpreted by Muller as a defense of Kantian nativism was now being interpreted by Helmholtz as a defense of empiricism . Helmholtz also stressed the importance of the empirical process of unconscious inference in space perception.39 Perception of space , he said , is not inherent ; instead we " infer " space from past experience , but without awareness that this process of inference is going on . Certain small cues constitute a sign that the object is to be found at a certain distance . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the object is . To use only one example ? in gazing at an object twenty feet away there are intervening objects at various closer distances that are actually seen as double , but without our noticing it . ( This can be verified by anyone who takes the trouble . Look across the room while holding a pen first , a few inches from the nose , and then at arm 's length , while still looking across the room . The doubleness of the pen will be evident in both instances but greatest when close up . ) Closer objects are seen , while looking at the far object , with varying degrees of doubleness . A specific degree of doubleness is unconsciously interpreted , without noticing the doubleness at a certain distance to the object . This is what Helmholtz meant by " unconscious inference . " Audition In the field of hearing Helmholtz made many contributions.40 Among them were his clarification of the role of timbre to round out the major harmonic components and his theory of how hearing is mediated by the ear and the relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves . Each of these must be examined in more detail . That pitch depends primarily on frequency of sound waves and intensity upon the amplitude of the waves had been understood and explained in Miiller 's llntulhuc/t ; as yet timbre had no similar explanation . The fact of  | timbre , that is to say , that there are qualitative differences between tones other than pitch was , of course , well known . Anyone hearing the same note being played by different instruments can not escape realizing the existence of something which makes them sound different despite their identity of pitch . Helmholtz explained this experience of timbre by the presence , in addition to the fundamental pitch , of so-called overtones or vibration rates more rapid than the fundamental tone which fixes the pitch.41 Most vibrating bodies , vibrate not only as wholes , but simultaneously as parts . It is these partial vibrations which give rise to timbre . The shape of waves making up a tone from a musical instrument , if visualized , would show the main wave being the same as that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that note , but with the part waves unique to this particular instrument , giving rise to the timbre . The more similar the tone of two instruments , the more similar the characterizing overtones were found to be . Here again , Helmholtz was not content merely to advance a theory ; he conclusively demonstrated his contention by building a series of tuning forks and resonators which permitted systematically varying the intensity of the overtones accompanying a fundamental tone . From these he produced synthetically the characteristic timbre of various instruments . His theory of hearing evolved over the years , and this is not the place to trace these modifications . His theory was essentially a theory of pitch ; he assumed that intensity was more or less explained by varying degrees of excitation of the fibers . Helmholtz marshalled evidence that a portion of the inner ear responded to an auditory wave stimulus by resonance , vibrating in tune with the frequency of the sound wave . The ear behaved similarly in the same way as striking a note on one tuning fork will set in vibration an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After discarding the organs of Alfonso Corti as the basis of differential tuning , he finally reached the conclusion that the basilar membrane with its many hair cells in the cochlea of the inner ear is the resolving organ of hearing . This basilar membrane is trapezoidal in shape ( narrow at one end and increasing gradually in width ) . The hairs on its narrower end he thought to be tuned to high pitches ; the hairs on the wider portion to the low pitches . Pitch , then , transmitted to the brain after analysis by resonance on the basilar membrane , is dependent upon place of stimulation . The differential action of a portion of the basilar membrane is the means whereby the pitch of the heard sound is determined . The resonance theory gave rise to many alternative theories.42 The most formidable competition to the resonance theory has come from the frequency  | theory in which the basilar membrane is said to vibrate as a whole , thus , giving rise to nerve impulses which preserve , unchanged , the frequency of the stimulus so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes the place where auditory analysis into different pitches takes place . Today each theory is seen as explaining some , but not all , of the evidence . It is clear that the old theories are too simple . Resolution of the present discrepancies is a task for future research . The doctrine of specific nerve energies was regarded by Helmholtz as an important established fact . It was natural for him to apply it to hearing . Differences of quality ipso facto thus meant that there are differences in the conduction sensory fibers . Research since Helmholtz 's day has demonstrated the existence of anywhere between 1500 and 11,000 distinguishable pitches.43 This means that Helmholtz had been arguing there was somewhere between these number of specific energies in hearing alone ! This bold step could hardly avoid being noticed , and the issue of the specific energies in hearing became a prominent one for research in all of the sense modalities . Helmholtz as a Great Scientist Helmholtz was deeply devoted to an empirical approach to science and yet had a broad philosophical outlook and possessed curiosity and originality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its conception , the construction of the necessary apparatus , and the execution of the research design . He was cautious in the interpretation of the results , yet he possessed great synthesizing ability in coordination of his findings with discovery in other related fields . Although it is perhaps out of fashion to say so , Helmholtz was one of the great scientists of modern times . REFERENCES ? 1 . J. MULLER , Handbuch der Ph ysiologie des Menschen.

In his self-image he was a psychologist even more than he was a philosopher . This subjective criterion of a psychologist will be found to be supported by a crude but adequate summary of his life 's work . Although he wrote four major books in philosophy running to perhaps twenty-one editions , in psychology he published six books which appeared in about thirty-six editions . In founding the modern science of psychology , Wilhelm Wundt was fully aware of what he was doing . In his preface to the first edition of his Principles of Physiological Psychology , dated 1874 , he begins with the impressive statement that the work was presented in order to " mark out a new domain of science . " 1 He also states flatly that , as a science , psychology can not be based upon metaphysical assumptions of any sort . To Wundt , the use of the experimental method , whenever possible , was 1 mandatory .

Essentially he held that the already available physiological methods were to be used for psychological study whenever they appeared , appropriate ; although there was no a priori way of determining when these should be employed . This particular contention owes much to Helmholtz 's view of the nature of physiological psychology . To Wundt , then , use of physiological methods depended upon relevance to the problem in question . Despite Wundt 's calling the new science " physiological psychology " he insisted the psychic and the physiological process are separate and parallel.2 As causality in natural science is a closed system , the phenomena that are studied by natural science can not affect the mind or be affected by it . Outer experience ( physics ) and inner experience ( psychology ) again differ in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The former is mediate , the latter is immediate . Conscious phenomena , therefore , are observable without reference to the body in which they occur , and " physiological psychology " does not imply an attempt to explain the phenomena of the psychical by examining the physical life . In short , mind-body interaction was rejected and instead , Wundt was a dualist of the psychophysical parallelistic variety . When psychology investigated the relation between the processes of the physical and the mental life , it was called psycho-physics . On this subject Wundt3 explicitly acknowledged he followed Fechner , but denied Fechner 's hope that the psychophysical methods could be used for metaphysical purposes . Metaphysical implications , he admitted , may later emerge from experimental research but only as an end result of research . Although using the psychophysical methods for many problems , Wundt disagreed with Fechner on what was being measured.4 Wundt held that to put the matter correctly one must state that two sensations are of equal intensity or one sensation is just noticeably different from another sensation . Wundt was seeking to study , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead , the relation between sensation on the one hand and the process of psychological judgment on the other . A purely psychological interpretation with no appeal to the relation of stimulus and sensation resulted . To Wundt , data obtained from psychological study were illustrative of a law of psychological relativity . Sensations differ to a degree which make possible judgments of ' their relative magnitude . Wimdt firmly established the method of ' introspection as psychology 's  | characteristic task . The use of introspection , in itself , was not new as even a fragmentary review will show . Socrates had made an appeal to introspection , and Plotinus and Augustine had sharpened this method . Descartes and the British empiricists were agreed on its use . Despite this agreement , a significant difference separated them . Descartes ' method of introspection has been characterized earlier as contemplative meditation upon problems that interested him . ( See page 166 . ) Intuitive self-evidence sought about cognition or the passions , both highly complex states , were Descarte 's favorite topics . The English empiricists shifted introspective interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sensation . The reduction by Hume of soul or mind to a bundle of sensations and his doctrine that images are faint copies of sensations are illustrative of this shift . Wundt continued this tendency toward simplicity by further refining the conscious elements and by combining the introspective process with experiment . Wundt recognized that conscious contents are fleeting and in continual flux ; 5 he therefore laid down explicit rules for proper use of the introspective method:6 ( 1 ) The observer , if at all possible , must be in a position to determine when the process is to be introduced . ( 2 ) He must be in a state of " strained attention . " ( 3 ) The observation must be capable of being repeated several times . ( 4 ) The conditions of the experiment must be such as to be capable of variation through introduction or elimination of certain stimuli and through the variation of strength and quality of the stimuli . The first rule is necessary so that the observer is not caught off guard but is set for the task . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew when to expect the introduction of the stimulus and was ready to observe the state of consciousness . He was , therefore , capable of isolating the mental processes of that moment . As for the second rule , the observer must be conscious of every nuance of that which is presented . Repetition , the third rule , allows for the uncovering of omissions and distortions of earlier trials . The fourth rule makes it possible to study the effect of variation , i.e. , the effect of the change resulting from addition or subtraction of various aspects of stimulating conditions as shown in variations of the experience . This last rule takes us to his conception of an experiment . Insofar as physiological psychology draws upon experiment , Wundt held we can refer to experimental psychology . ' It is perhaps from John Stuart Mill that he derived his conception of psychology as a science of observation and experiment . ' But Mill only talked about experiments ; Wundt carried them out . Wundt9 asserted that in psychology pure self-observation is insufficient . It is only when additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . The essence of an experiment is to vary the con  | ditions of a stimulus situation and then observe the changes in the experience of the observer . In advocating experimental control of conditions of introspection , Wundt was taking a giant step . Herbart had urged using mathematics in the study of psychological problems , although he had denied the possibility of using experiment . Kant had ' not only denied the possibility of experiment in psychology , but also held that the use of mathematics itself was impossible . He had held that the only dimension of consciousness was time and that with one dimension one could not carry out experiments , and , consequently , psychical processes are indeterminate.10 Since practically all German philosophers of his time were either Kantians or Herbartians , it is to Wundt 's credit that he overcame this formidable intellectual block and saw that both mathematics and experiment could be applied in psychology . Wundt agreed that Kant was correct concerning the uni-dimensional nature of consciousness when we confine ourselves to internal experience . But when we turn to external stimuli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also one more dimension that Kant had omitted is added , namely , intensity . " With the dimensions of quality and intensity , experiment became possible . Every simple sensation has a qualitative determinant , such as blue , warm , or sweet.12 Qualities are not divisible into simpler units . As for Herbart , as we have seen , he recognized that these classes of variables were present , but had not appreciated how they could be turned to experimental use . Armed with intensity and quality as the two classes of variables , Wundt was prepared for the experimental study of psychological phenomena . In sound , for example , intensity , it is true , is never separable from some quality of pitch , but it is possible to change either the intensity alone ( loud-soft ) , or the pitch alone ( high-low ) , while maintaining the other unchanged . Moreover , we may use two notes and consequently change the quality of the sound so that it is different from that of either note alone . Intensity and quality became subjects for scientific study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimental study of psychology . // Wilhelm was born at the village of Neckarau near Heidelberg in Baden on August 16 , 1832 , the son of a Lutheran pastor . He was a solitary child , never close to his parents , played little , and absorbed himself in study . Even as a young child he stayed in the home of a Lutheran vicar who was his tutor . He had formed so strong an attachment to this tutor , presumably at first his father 's assistant , that when the vicar was transferred , he was inconsolable  | until allowed to board with him and to continue under his tutelage . At thirteen he entered the gymnasium , where he also boarded and was ready for the university at nineteen . His medical studies took him to Tubingen , Heidelberg , and Berlin . It has been hazarded that Wundt went into medicine without any special call , but in part it was because he wanted to continue away from home ! There is some doubt whether he ever intended to practice medicine . As with many others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the means of entering into a scientific career which even at this age he seems to have had in mind . He did some work at the Institute of Johannes Muller in physiology , and a year or two later he shifted to physiology as an academic field . In 1857 he was appointed Dozent at Heidelberg and began to lecture in physiology . His first announced course in physiology attracted four students ! Between 1858 and 1864 he served as assistant to Helmholtz , who had just arrived from Bonn . Relations with the taciturn Helmholtz were non-existent , according to Titchener . In 1864 Wundt was appointed assistant professor . Somewhat surprisingly , in 1866 he was chosen to represent Heidelberg in the Baden Chamber , but he soon resigned . There was a delay of academic advance until 1874 when he was called to Zurich to the chair of Inductive Philosophy . This , it should be noted , is only an apparent shift in field . In academic circles he had come to be viewed as a promising man for appointment to a post in philosophy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy . During these years , Wundt was very active in physiology . In 1858 he published a study of muscular movement and elasticity during action14 in which he reported investigating the effect of constant galvanic current and mechanical thermal and chemical stimuli upon muscles . Not only was he working in this field , but a conception of psychology as a distinct science was beginning to emerge . Between 1858 and 1862 various sections of his Beitrage zur Theorie der Sinneswahrnehmung15 appeared . This volume so much anticipated later developments in his thinking that Titchener , one of his greatest students , has argued that it outlined the program of his entire life . In the introduction of this work Wundt stressed the primacy of method as a means of scientific advance . He also cited apparatus advances , such as the laryngoscope and the ophthalmoscope , as a means of ushering in whole series of discoveries . Psychology , he goes on , has not yet felt the impulse of the new empirical method being used all around it . It has asked metaphysical questions first , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its destination . These are questions appropriate to where psychology may end , but not to where it should start . It must take experiences , and the simplest of these  | experiences at that , for its point of departure . He seems to be saying , psychology should first crawl before it can walk . In that which follows , he marshals evidence primarily from vision and secondarily from touch . One may recognize in this work his struggle to utilize physiological methodology in dealing with psychological problems . From 1867 onward , he gave a course at Heidelberg entitled , " physiological psychology . " This date establishes the formal offering of an academic course of this nature . As he " worked up " his lecture notes over the next few years , a new book , by general agreement his most important book , began to take form . This was his Grundzuge der physiologischen Psychologie.16 The first half was published in 1873 and the second in 1874 . It was destined to go through six editions , the last in 1911 , and swell in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of most of his books that new , amplified , and revised editions would appear from time to time . ) The Grundzuge changed in detail , sometimes very important detail , but it is remarkable how the expansion and change did not require major shifts in his systematic views . It is the one indispensible source for an account of his system of psychology . Wundt entered on the last , longest , and most important phase of his career in 1875 . In that year he became Professor of Philosophy at Leipzig . Here he lived and worked for forty-five years . At the University of Leipzig in 1875 , Wundt established one of the first two experimental laboratories of psychology in the world.17 For many years it has been customary to consider 1879 as the founding year for the first experimental laboratory in the world on the mistaken belief that it was in this year that Wundt 's Leipzig Laboratory was given formal recognition by university authorities . Formal recognition to a course in " experimental psychology " did not come from the university until the winter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while an " Institute for Experimental Psychology " as such , was not listed by university authorities until 1894 . In this connection 1879 is notable only for appearance of the first student to do publishable psychological research with Wundt , which may be the reason for saying that it was " founded " in that year . Actually , before Wundt 's arrival in October , 1875 , the Royal Ministry had set aside a room to be used by Wundt for his own experimental work and for demonstrations connected with his Psychologische Ubungen or " Psychological Practicum . " A good case can be made for the establishment of the first laboratory in psychology in this year of 1875 ? or rather of the two first laboratories ? since William James also equipped a small laboratory in the same year . ( See page 349 . ) Even this brief account brings out both the subjectivity of deciding upon and the gradualness of the " founding " . of this important psychological agency . ' " Nevertheless , if  | psychology must have a date to celebrate its coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice . In 1881 , Wundt began to publish a journal , Philosophische Studien , containing reports of experimental studies beginning to flow from his laboratory . This was the first journal devoted as much to psychology as to philosophy . Lest the title be puzzling , it should be indicated that Wundt thought philosophy should be psychological . He did not support attempts to have psychology a separate department from that of philosophy . Moreover , between 1880 and 1901 he published four books in philosophy ? a logic , an ethics , a systematic philosophy , and an introduction to the field . One of the results of the founding of the laboratory and the spreading fame of Wundt was the migration of students to Leipzig to study with him and to work in the laboratory . There gathered around him would-be psychologists using introspection and experiment to derive the laws of the human mind . In this way Wundt became the leader of a " school " of psychology . These students were united in their systematic views as well as sharing a common purpose . Instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in books , the laboratory atmosphere resulted in specific research studies appearing as articles in journals . Wundt would then synthesize the results of the various studies in the successive editions of the Grundzuge . The sheer availability of co-workers was important . Since the " experimenter " could hardly be the " observer " at one and the same time , the experimenter of one study was available as a subject for another . Lest this point be dismissed ! as trivial , it is pertinent to indicate that " introspection " as practiced in Wundt 's laboratory was not a skill acquired without a period of rigorous apprenticeship . To get at the elements of experience required arduous training . Moreover , even if non-student assistants could be trained as subjects , the nature of the tasks to which they were put , to be illustrated in a moment , would have demanded payment . One does not embark upon introspection as a lark ! In later days when simple report , not introspection , was all that was needed , the problem was solved by American ingenuity through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The work of the Leipzig Laboratory may illustrate what a major segment of experimental psychology was like before and at the turn of the century . About one hundred experimental studies appeared in the Philosophische Studien during its twenty-odd years , almost all of them carried out either in the laboratory or conducted by Wundt 's students soon after they left Leipzig . Consequently , the research bore very heavily the impress of Wundt 's aims , since typically he assigned the problem on which a particular student was to work .  | Boring 's summarizing classification will be utilized to sketch the research coming from Wundt 's laboratory.19 In quick overview the studies may be classed as those in sensation and perception , reaction , attention , feeling , and association . About one-half of the researches concerned problems in sensation and perception , particularly in vision . Papers on the psychophysics of color , peripheral vision , color contrast , negative afterimages , visual contrast , and color blindness are typical of these concerned with visual sensation ; visual size and optical illusions are characteristic of those on visual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beats and combination tones also were studied . An attack was carried on with the problem of time perception by studying the ability of subjects to reproduce intervals of varying lengths in the comparison of " filled " times ( time occupied with mental work or sensory stimulation ) and unfilled time . Tactual sensation came in for investigation through the problems of the two-point threshold , using the already familiar methods of Weber and Fechner . About one-sixth of the time and effort of the workers in the laboratory was given to the reaction experiment . The subtractive procedure of Donders was used , ( see page 248 ) although his times for choice and discrimination was replaced by a more complicated classification of times for volition , perception , apperception , cognition , association , and judgment . Hopes ran high in the Leipzig Laboratory for a chronometry of the mind , since , by the additive and subtractive procedures , it appeared entirely feasible to work out the times necessary for each of these processes to take place . However , these hopes were dashed , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process was neither constant from person to person nor from study to study , " . . . and later introspection showed that in a more complicated reaction the entire conscious pattern is changed and that the alteration is not merely the insertion of another link on a chain . " 20 Oswald Kiilpe2l was the one who delivered the most telling blow against the view that the elements are additive . He showed that changing the task does not merely add another unit ; instead , it alters the whole process . Kiilpe interpreted Lange 's results as showing that the subject 's predisposition or attitude alters the perceptualreactive process . Previously Lange 's classical research study22 had established characteristic differences in speed between some subjects who attend to the stimulus as compared to other subjects who attend to the response , in favor of the greater speed of the latter . This did much to solve the problem of the personal equation . Those who attend to the response react more quickly than those who must shift attention from stimulus to the reaction to be made . As interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then of feeling came to take its place , each inducting about one-tenth of the  | laboratory 's studies . Lange 's study , just mentioned , helped to create the interest in attention . To Wundt , attention was that clear perception of a narrow region of the content of consciousness . An example of this is the word or words we are reading on this page relative to the rest of the page , as well as the adjoining page and much of the surrounding environment of the room . Whatever is in the focus of attention becomes distinct and is separated from the rest of the field . Research in the area of attention was performed by means of the complication experiment , i.e. , the range of attention and fluctuation of attention were studied . Following the lead of Jacobs , Catte1123 was responsible for carrying out the classic study of attention span ( meaning that which can be taken in at a glance ) finding that four , five or six units ( lines , letters or words ) could be apprehended in an exposure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement " of attention . Studies of feeling , the work of the laboratory in the 1890 's , involved the use of the method of expression through which feelings and correlated changes of pulse , breathing , muscular strength , and the like were studied . The method of paired comparisons was also developed . This method requires the subject to compare each particular stimulus with every other stimulus being used in terms of the subjective feeling aroused . Suppose the task was to judge the pleasingness of a variety of colored paper patches : patch A is compared to 13 , C , D , E , F , then patch B is compared to A , C , D , E , F , and so on . On each trial the observer was to say which was most pleasing of each pair A or B , A or C , and so on . Studies of association make up another one-tenth of the total output of the laboratory during these years . Under Wundt 's direction much was done to refine the method . Galton , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page 308 ) although using single words as stimuli , had often allowed his responses to take the form of a connected narrative description of the images . Wundt required each response to be a single word which not only made classification of responses easier to handle , but also the time relations involved to be more susceptible to precise measurement . More exact instruments of measurement such as the lip key and the chronoscope , which measures time in thousandths of seconds , were used . The major categories of association derived by Wundt 's students were two in number , " inner " and " outer . " Inner associations are those showing intrinsic connections between the words , as in lion-animal , spearshield , cow-milk , and white-black . Outer associations are those in which there are other purely extrinsic or " accidental " associations , as in curve-accident , or hook-concept , or in speech-habit associations , such as fur-fly , or crash-helmet. ( : uttell was chiefly responsible for discovering the importance of control in association . Instruction to give reactions which bore a definite relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subordinate , or the like ? made for quicker reactions than did free association in which there was freedom to choose any word that one wished . Thus giving the response " dark " to the stimulus word " light " when one had been told in advance to give the opposite of the stimulus word resulted in a more rapid reaction than when no control on the associations to be given was exercised . It would appear that when there are many possible responses more or less equally associated with the stimulus word , then there is a process of interference which delays the reaction . An everyday example is the interference met by one who speaks more than one foreign language in arriving at the correct word , especially if the languages themselves are similar , as in Spanish and French . Emil Kraepelin , 24 the great psychiatrist who had studied under Wundt , extended the experimental use of association to problems in pscyhopathology . He found that under experimentally induced fatigue , alcoholic intoxication , and similar states there is an increase in superficial , extrinsic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increase at the expense of " inner " associations which depend upon meaning . The former resemble the associations of some psychotic patients , particularly the manics . It becomes apparent from the survey of the research from his laboratory that Wundt did not occupy himself with developing new kinds of experiments ; the methods he used are already generally familiar to the reader from the account of psychology before Wundt . Studies of the psychology and physiology of the senses owe much to the work which went before , particularly to Helmholtz . Reaction time studies again owe something , not only to Helmholtz , but also to Donders , while the association study can be attributed to Galton . Even the study of feeling , where Wundt was at his most original in a theoretical fashion , was dependent upon extension of Fechner 's method of impression to that of paired comparisons and in studies of expression to the utilization of already existing methods of study of pulse , breathing , and the like . Even for attention there had been antecedent studies , although no occasion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quantitative terms the research areas already extant . His view of the scope of experimental psychology consequently was a narrow one , practically confined to the five topics into which the research from his laboratory was classified . Wundt began sponsoring doctoral dissertations as early as 1875.25 By 1919 the total had reached an impressive 186 of which 70 were on philosophical topics and 116 on psychological problems . Not all of the men whom he sponsored were destined to become leading psychologists . Struck by the number of unfamiliar names , one psychologist2 " tried to trace them down : uul the astonishing number of 86 could not be found . A not inconsiderable number  | of the students were apparently content , after receiving the precious title of " Herr Doktor , " to sink back into the oblivion of the gymnasium . His students came to him from all over Europe and from the United States . Many were American . The first of these was G. Stanley Hall , fresh from his studies at Harvard . This roving ambassador of American psychology-to-be " dropped in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new laboratory and studied with Wundt . Although ambivalent as he was toward Wundt , he is careful to state that most of his time was spent with Ludwig , the physiologist.27 But his story is best told in a later chapter . James McKeen Cattell , Wundt 's first bona fide American student , studied at Leipzig on two occasions . It was on his second sojourn in 1885 that Cattell made his pronouncement to Herr Professor that he needed an assistant and that he , Cattell , was that assistant . He , too , will be considered later . Among other American students of Wundt 's were Edward W. Scripture , later director of the Yale Psychological Laboratory and a student of hearing ; Edward A. Pace , for many years head of the Department of Psychology at Catholic University and the leading voice in interpreting the " new psychology " to Catholics ; Lightner Witmer , the founder of the first psychological clinic at the University of Pennsylvania , and Charles H. Judd , the pioneer educational psychologist at the University of Chicago . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these Americans managed to show on their return to the United States after the severely rigorous " pure " training they received . Born in England where there was no suitable post for an experimental psychologist such as he , Edward Bradford Titchener , another of Wundt 's students , came to America to direct the psychological work at Cornell University . Among this group he was the most unswervingly faithful to the program of his teacher . The best known continental psychologists who worked in the Leipzig Laboratory , besides Kulpe , already mentioned , were Hugo Miinsterberg , Alfred Lehmann , Ernst Meumann , Theodore Lipps , and Felix Krueger . According to Titchener , 28 Wundt was a quiet , unassuming , pleasant person whose life followed a totally regulated pattern . He worked on his current hook or article in the morning , then had a consultation hour . In the afternoon he paid a formal visit to the laboratory , following this with a walk during which he cast his lecture into rough form , then the delivery of the lecture without notes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very popular lecturer , apparently simplifying his material somewhat to suit his audience . As Ha1129 puts it , Wundt 's style of writing is as lusterless as lead ? but as solid . To perhaps a surprising extent , concerts and interests in current affairs occupied many of his evenings . He was a man of simple tastes , who avoided public functions and virtually never travelled .  | It is not surprising that from this background would emerge the serious hard-working , hard-driving writer of so many books in so many editions that no single person would be so humorless as to read every work in every edition . If he did try to do so , what would he face ? Assuming the figures which had been calculated by Boring30 with tongue in cheek as to his productivity of 53,735 pages ( averaging out to 2.2 pages per day for every day from 1853 to 1920 ) as a base , the consumer-reader , reading at the rate of sixty pages per day , would need nearly two-and-a-half years to go through the entire output . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first edition of the Principles in which he had expressed his intent of presenting a new science , he could say in the fifth edition that the material now was pouring in from all sides.31 No longer was there any doubt as to the legitimacy of his endeavors . Instead , divergent trends within the field itself were becoming a cause of concern to him . European psychology was beginning to have centers of influence other than Wundt and Leipzig . The climate of the times was producing other psychologists independent of Wundt who had drawn on their common cultural heritage and arrived at an experimental psychology by the end of the century . Some of them will be considered in the next chapter . At the moment concern is with Wundt 's reaction to work which deviated from his own . He was unalterably opposed to the application of psychology.32 When Meumann , a gifted pupil , turned to educational psychology , Wundt treated it as if this were desertion in the face of the enemy . Kraepelin , another student who applied psychology to psychiatry and was advised by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat better . Work outside of that of his own students came in for even more severe criticism . He was especially critical of the work of the so-called Wurzburg School . After securing the immediate response to stimulation , the workers at Wurzburg went on to question their subjects about all that went on in their minds . Wundt considered this nothing more than a blatant violation of the rules of introspection . Despite the admission that child ( and animal ) psychology were supplementary branches34 of the field , he rejected categorically the beginning of child psychology in the work of Preyer and Baldwin . Their work was not psychology since the conditions of study could not be controlled adequately.35 Lest this last stricture cause raised eyebrows , it should be emphasized this evaluation occurs about the turn of the century and concerned the work of the men just mentioned . There is no indication , however , that he changed his view in later years . In his laboratory , no work with animals was conducted . Ile was also very critical of French psychology , claiming that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies of suggestion and hypnotism.36 Somewhat petulantly he argued that one can not give the name , " experimental psychology " to each and every operation that brings about a change in consciousness . Those studies lack exact introspection , so they are not true psychological experiments . The idea of a social psychology was part of the Zeitgeist.37 Steinthal and Lazarus had published the first issue of their journal devoted to the topic in 1859-1860 . At first social psychology was seen by Wundt as only an auxiliary science . It was not until 1893 that he was convinced that social psychology deserved to be considered a coordinate branch along with experimental psychology . Experiment is not feasible when more complex problems than those of perception and memory are considered . Beyond this point , experiment fails us and we must have recourse to folk psychology . In making this division of labor , Wundt was also saying that the higher mental processes , incapable of direct experimental attack , should , perforce , be studied through the chief products of common mental life , that is to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , he held to be the major key to understanding thought . In order to consider the problems of the higher mental processes , he began writing the Volkerpsychologie39 ( Folk Psychology ) the first volume appearing in 1900 with nine more volumes between then and 1920 . Folk psychology was conceived to be the investigation of the various , still existing stages of mental development in mankind.40 In this sense it can and has been called " genetic " psychology . To Wundt , mankind shows development through a series of successive levels with primitive man as the lowest grade of culture , moving on to the totemic age , thence to the age of heroes and gods , and , finally , the age in which we are now living , that of the advance toward humanity . Folk psychology is differentiated from ethnology by Wundt because the latter is concerned primarily with the external cultures and only in a very incidental fashion with the psychological characteristics that are at the core of folk psychology . As if according to plan , Wundt wrote his psychological reminiscences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he died near Leipzig on August 31 , two weeks after his eighty-eighth birthday . SOME SYSTEMATIC VIEWS Wundt 's claim to greatness rests much more upon what has been said of him earlier than it does upon his systematic views of psychology . His system amounted primarily to a classificatory scheme , and , as Boring42 observes , this  | itself was not capable of direct or indirect experimental proof or disproof . Wundt was constantly revising his position on various issues from one edition of his books to the next as new evidence appeared . It would be impossible to do justice to these changes in a short space , so only his mature theoretical guide lines , as established in the fifth edition of the Principles , published in 1902,43 and in the second edition of his Introduction , 44 published in German in 1911 and in English in 1912 , will be examined unless otherwise specified . The effort to offer a rather tightly compressed account of his schema for psychology is rendered easier by his dependence upon already familiar formulations . To Wundt , psychology is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a process , and yet it has elements , a somewhat confusing ambiguous view of the matter . Consciousness supplies us the total of its immediate experience . The more specific immediate experiences involved , to name only the most important , are sensations , feelings , ideas , volitions and apperceptions . None of these is given in an uncompounded state ; they must be abstracted from the compound by introspective analysis . In fact , all of our experiences are complex and must be analysed introspectively . The elements of the mind , or the basic states of consciousness , are sensations and feelings . When abstracted by introspection , pure sensations are found to possess only intensity and quality and are without spatial or temporal aspects . Sensations are objective in the sense that they have reference to " external " things . Experiences directly aroused by external stimuli often were referred to by earlier systematists as sensations while those dependent upon internal conditions were called ideas . Wundt held this to be an error . The sources for touch and organic sensations of our body are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulation from external objects . Hence , these sensations , too , were " external . " Feelings that accompany sensations are the subjective complements referring to states of consciousness itself . Sensations and feelings are simultaneous aspects of immediate experience . Sometimes the aspect of feeling is apparently negligible , but it is always present . If intensity be increased , it becomes apparent in , say , a light increased in intensity to the point it becomes dazzling . Wundt , nevertheless , considered feeling an experience that was distinct from that other conscious element , sensation . Feelings can not be described in terms of **27;301;TOOLONG alone , as Wundt had held earlier . Two additional dimensions ? tension-relaxation aucl excitement-depression ? must also be used to account for the range of the experiences of feeling . Wundt had found that a given feeling experience shows three dimensions but in different combinations , say pleasant , tense , and excited  | in one case or unpleasant , relaxed , and depressed in another . Feeling experience is not a matter of simultaneity alone . The dimensions in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the dimension of pleasantness ; but then tension and excitement would become apparent , and unpleasantness would come to predominate over pleasantness . This tri-dimensional theory of feeling , as it was called , stimulated a tremendous amount of research both in his own and rival laboratories , but the theory was not borne out by post-Wundtian research . However , the results of these studies were found to be applicable in other situations . It is in this way that psychology , having become an experimental science , advances . A theory may stand or fall ; the experiments persist , either interpreted as isolated facts or worked into a modified or different system when they are congruent with it . When sensation and feeling are combined , they form ideas and perceptions . To Wundt , the term , " idea , " included within its scope such " complexes " as both " memory images " and " perceptions . " 45 Ideas , including both sensations and feelings in composite , are representative of objects either in perception or in memory . Wundt , chronologically following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was but one of the principles of combination.46 He would prefer to limit it to successive association , such as learning , since he considered simultaneous compounds to be so much more tightly knit as to require a different principle of combination . This was fusion , such as that which occurs in tones in the musical chord or in illusions . Consciousness shows various degrees of apperception , of contexts , and of connections ? the unification of the conscious contents . Children may run together words in something they recite without understanding what it is they are saying . Adults may parrot a difficult concept but not understand what is meant by what they are saying . To bring about unification requires apperception , a combination of a complex into a unity . This doctrine of apperception is already familiar , but Wundt stressed its cognitive aspects more than did his predecessors . To define it more fully , clearness of comprehension of conscious content , occurring by combining of sensory experiences with pre-existing ideas and accompanied by feelings , gives apperception . Feeling enters into the process and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a compound is dependent upon apperception . Easy , smooth flowing reactions give rise to pleasure , conflictual ones to pain . Wundt made a distinction between the whole range of consciousness and the so-called fixation point of apperception . Only processes in the fixation point of apperception are apperceived . This does not mean that apperception can not range over the complex of ideas , referred to as the apperceptive mass , but  | at a given moment the matter in the fixation of apperception is a selection from this mass . When apperceptions refer to any given content , Wundt says they are customarily called " states of attention . " 47 Wundt preferred to discuss the phenomena in terms of apperception , possibly to bring out its active character in contradistinction to states of attention as a more passive process , but knew , of course , that others could and did discuss this problem in terms of attention , a rather more familiar way of handling the issue . Combinations of feelings along with ideational processes give the emotions . In some emotions , such as joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as anger and fear , displeasure is the stronger . Closely related to the emotions are the volitional processes . To Wundt , volitions , instead of being ideational , are primarily affective . The feelings were the " determining factors " of volition . Sometimes feelings are not so strong as to produce volition , but volition is not operative unless they are present . Volition culminates in an action as when the angry person strikes the object of his anger . Without the striking it would have been an emotion alone . In dealing with volition Wundt was considering action as differentiated from reception . The distinction between sensory and motor nerves arising from the work of the physiologists carried over into Wundt 's psychology at this point . Sensations are the psychological phenomena associated with the former , movements , called reflexes , are the psychological phenomena associated with the latter . There was a natural coherence between a sensation and a movement which was modified through experience . That the mind was reducible to elements and the fashion in which its elements cohere is obviously a heritage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level ; the experiences we have are more than the sum of their parts ? there is a creative synthesis of immediate experience ( the principle of mental chemistry in Thomas Brown ) . Once the systematic analysis into elements had been accomplished , their manner of synthesis could be carried-out . It was as if the elements once accounted for went a long way toward explaining the total reality . There was still something left over , a fact which Wundt recognized but did not work out fully . Seeing a landscape did not add up to thirteen specified visual sensations of variant hues and the accompanying feelings of mild excitement , high pleasure , and low tension , meaningfully perceived . That which remained , however , did not interest him very much . Although synthesis , as differentiated from analysis , was relatively neglected by Wundt , that he did make it part of his formal system and thereby called attention to it , was to have later important repercussions .  | Wundt was the first modern psychologist ? he conceived of experimental psychology as a science . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first journal . In addition to these pioneering efforts , Wundt was the great synthesizer of research findings , both of the work that preceded him and of that carried on by his students . Wundt 's forte was not luminous ideas lighting upon the dark corners or giving us a new dazzling perspective on the old picture . Rather , he worked over a thousand details , cleaning here , repairing there , filling a crack here , so that psychology leaving his hands was an improved , more coherent picture , but still a familiar one . The areas of investigation worked out by Wundt ? sensation and perception , reaction , attention , feeling , association ? were such as to become firmly fixed as the very chapters in the textbooks that were to come , making this work a not inconsiderable portion of psychology . And yet there were other areas of psychology where his treatment was either nonexistent or , at best , woefully inadequate . The problem areas of learning ( as differentiated from association ) , motivation , emotion , intelligence , thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who had other points of view . Whatever one may think of the narrowness of Wundt 's conception of psychology , it must be admitted that the course he chose to follow had the effect of solidifying an independent field of psychology . If he had struck out on uncharted paths it is quite conceivable that psychology as a separate discipline would not have been forthcoming until later . It does not detract from his achievement to add that much of the history of psychology following Wundt consisted of rebelling against the limitations he had placed upon the field . In fact , forward movement is most sure when it has something to push against . REFERENCES* I. W. WUNDT , Principles of Physiological Psychology . ( 5th German ed . ) ( Vol. 1 , translated by E. B.

Principles . p. 316.  | DESPITE the dominance that Wilhelm Wundt exercised upon German psychology , there were some psychologists outside of his orbit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merit special attention : Franz Brentano , who advanced a view that psychology is properly concerned with acts rather than contents ; Hermann Ebbinghaus , who became the first psychologist systematically to study memory and learning ; G. E. Muller , who carefully followed up and expanded the work of his predecessors on psychophysics , color vision , and memory ; and Oswald Kulpe , Wundt 's erstwhile assistant , who became the leader of the group of psychologists that came to be called the " Wurzburg School , " the school that attempted to broaden the use of introspection to include the study of the higher mental processes . FRANZ BRENTANO In 1874 , the year that saw the complete publication of the crucial first edition of Wundt 's Grundziige , another significant but markedly different hook appeared . This was the Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint , written by the Catholic priest , Franz Brentano . While Wlnldt had drawn his inspiration 2so  | from practically contemporaneous work , Brentano reached back far into the past to the work of Aristotle , from him to Aquinas , and thence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's life will help to understand his book 's significance . Life of Brentano1 A nephew of the German Romantic poet , Clemens Brentano , Franz was born in Marienburg on the Rhine in 1838 . When he was very young , his family moved to Bavaria . He lost his father early , and his mother , a devout Catholic , encouraged his early inclination toward a vocation in the clerical life . He first studied at Berlin where he was thoroughly trained by F. A. Trendelenburg in the works of Aristotle . This training was decisive in all that he did afterward , for his psychological and philosophical thinking bore the impress of Aristotle . In 1856 he moved on to Munich where he worked under Ignatius Dollinger , the famous church historian . He also studied philosophy and theology at Munich and later at Tubingen , where he took his degree in 1862 . He then entered the priesthood in 1864 . Two years later he became Dozent in philosophy at Wurzburg . For the next few years he busied himself with lecturing and writing papers on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church . During the sixties a controversy of considerable moment within the Catholic Church concerned the infallibility of the Pope . Ignatius Dollinger , Brentano 's former teacher , was a leader of the group within the Church which opposed the doctrine of papal infallibility . Brentano , too , had strong convictions about this proposed dogma and wrote and published a memoir in its refutation on the basis of which he became something of a leader among the dissident clerics . Then , in 1870 the Vatican Council accepted papal infallibility , making it dogma . Brentano was now faced with that age-old decision , to acquiesce or to become a heretic . In his preface to a posthumously published work , 2 he emphasized that this dilemma was but the last of a series of his doubts about being able to reconcile faith and reason . Before the meeting of the Vatican Council took place , he had doubted papal infallibility without other matters beclouding the issue . After the Council 's decision , he still found it untenable , and so , in 1873 , he resigned his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He thereafter put off clerical duties and garb . Unlike many of the other priests who left the Church at this time , he did not join another church , such as the so-called " Old Catholic Church , " which was sponsored by Iollinger . Nor did Protestantism appeal to him . He remained to his death a devout Christian of simple faith , but without church affiliation.3  | During the period that followed , without either university or clerical duties to interfere , he produced the book , Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint.4 It was planned as the first of two volumes , the second of which was never completed . In 1874 he was appointed , as a layman , Professor at the University of Vienna , a post he held until 1880 . It was in that year a second major crisis arose . He wished to marry a Catholic , which was impossible for a former priest under Austrian law . He once again resigned his professorship , took citizenship in Saxony , and married . He then immediately returned to the University of Vienna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over these years his lectures were very popular . The hall was always crowded , and informal smaller discussions were usual ; his students often followed him home.5 Among his students , first at Wurzburg and then at Vienna , were such diverse persons as Carl Stumpf , the assiduous student of the psychology of sound ; Edmund Husserl , the philosopher of phenomonology ; Christian von Ehrenfels , the originator of the concept of form quality and founder of the Austrian school of the philosophy of values ; Thomas Masaryk , the founder of the Czechoslovakian Republic ; and Sigmund Freud , the originator of psychoanalysis . The influence of Brentano upon Freud is still a moot question . He may have been more influenced by Brentano than is generally recognized.6 Brentano 's students testified to their devotion to him ; Stumpf and Husserl were especially glowing in this respect. ? It is generally agreed that Brentano expressed himself most completely orally rather than in his relatively few publications , and that he is to be judged more through the contributions of his students than his own efforts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through oral exchange than through the written word . In 1894 his wife died , and his own health became poor . An eye disorder threatened his sight . In that year he resigned for the last time , never to hold an academic post again . After his resignation he devoted the remainder of his life to study , occasional writing , and informal conversational teaching among his friends and admirers . In 1895-6 he settled in Florence . During the years in Vienna he had published hardly any psychological works . Shortly before he left , he did write some papers on visual illusions . In 1907 a small but significant book on sense psychology8 appeared , and in 1911 he published Von der Klassifikation der psychischen Phanomene , 9 his nearest approximation to the missing second volume of the Psychologie of thirty-seven years before . After Italy entered the war , Brentano , a pacifist , moved to Ziirich , where he died in 1917.  | Act Psychology For Brentano there was no essential difference between philosophy and psychology.10 In this regard he was returning to the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the means of rescuing philosophy from the morass into which it had slumped under Kant , whom he considered a mystic to be classed with Plotinus . John Stuart Mill also influenced his thinking in regard to psychology as basic to other fields . Even the title of his book is firmly rooted in the past because the monopoly on " empirical " that the associationist had established for the meaning of derivation from sense experience was minimized , and a return to the Greek meaning was made . By empirical , Brentano intended to emphasize activity . As Brett put it , " . . . it was empirical ' in the sense that it was based on the claim that it reached a pure experience and analysed it . " 11 Titchener12 considered that Brentano 's use of " empirical " was meant to draw attention to the fact that he used a consistent and reasoned account of mind , which is essentially argumentative in nature , rather than being descriptive , which Titchener considered Wundt 's psychology ( and his own ) to be . Carmichael , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more apt term to describe Brentano 's approach would be to call it , " rational . " It would be easy to agree with this position , since Brentano 's approach was essentially logical . He presented arguments and offered proofs . Observation rather than experiment was his primary tool . He did not reject experiment , as such , although in discussing experiments where he disagreed with the results , he tended to try to destroy them by argument , not by carrying out or suggesting research . In his studies of illusions , it was characteristic that his method of exposition was to suggest to the reader that he , too , see for himself . He would reproduce the illusions , and on this test by the reader he was content to rest his case.14 His writing also gave the impression that , once developed , his system was permanently fixed.15 As a first approximation , before turning directly to the way Brentano stated his system of psychology , let us try to relate his thinking to Aristotle . It may be remembered that Aristotle ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of object , as distinguished from nutrition which took in the material itself from the object . We eat the nutritive object , the fig ; we sense its form without assimilating the matter . In sensing there is assimilation of form , not merely passively but actively in that sensing actualizes the quality of the object . When we pass beyond sensing to knowing ( see page 64 ) ?  | from color or magnitude to asking what is color or magnitude ? these universals are actualized by knowing , and knowing as actualized is identical with the form . Brentano was moved by a similar spirit ; he wished to find a way of relating the person , the experiencer , to the environment . He insisted that a distinction must be made between the experience as structure and the experience as a way of acting . " The quality " blue " and the sensing of blue and different . This latter process is the true subject matter of psychology . Going back to Aristotle for something similar to his psychology , it might even be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out when it actualizes blue . The blueness , as such , is merely passive , something akin to the unmoved mover of Aristotle . Looking at blue is a way of experientially doing . Without going into further details or tracing the development through the thinking of Aquinas , it may be noted that it was in the spirit of these and other considerations that Brentano derived a psychology of the act . This is to say that he stressed activity of the mind at the expense of the content of the mind . Psychology is concerned with the act , not the content . This does not mean that content disappears , nor does it mean that the content with which it deals is always " real . " We refer our ideating to objects whether they do or do not exist . We may ideate blue of the sky or the skin sheen of the unicorn even though in the two cases their epistemological status is different . Nevertheless , they may be the objects in our thinking . Nor is the content of a psychical phenomenon always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act has become the content or object of another act . On seeing a color , the color , itself , is not mental ; it is the act of seeing which is mental . The color itself belongs to physics . Psychical phenomena relate to content , but they are not that content . Nevertheless , to see , some thing must be seen . It " inexists " in the seeing . Act psychology constitutes an intentionalism , since mind is represented as comprising mental acts which by intention are directed upon some object . Seeing , hearing , and so on are mental acts which must have some object like blue which they " intend . " In Brentano 's terminology seeing " intends " the blue which " inexists " within the act of seeing , being the " immanent " object of the seeing . " I see blue , " is the act of the mental datum , and the blue is this commonest object of the act . We can define psychical phenomena , says Brentano , by saying that they are phenomena which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points to something outside itself , called by Brentano , " intentionality . " When we see something , two things take place ? first comes the act of seeing , and then comes the seen object or content of seeing . The objects are not part of the act . The object intentionally inexists with the act ( not actually existing ,  | hence " inexisting , " but present by implication ) . Mental acts refer to something outside themselves . An act has an object which it intends or is directed upon . The source of all psychological experience is inner perception . Each of us has an inner perception which supplies the psychological phenomena . Calling them psychic phenomena or subsuming them under soul makes no difference . If we do , the soul is its acts . In this connection it can be seen that Brentano is neatly disposing of physiology . Psychology can not be reduced to physiology , since its field is the act . Psychic phenomena consisted of acts of three kinds ? ideating , judging , and feeling . Quite consistently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the various types of a relationship of a subject to an object.18 The first and ubiquitous relationship is that of having an idea of an object ? real , imaginary , past , present , future , and even negative . Hence , there is ideating . But in addition the sheer diversity of kinds of objects ideated make possible an affirmation or denial of the object . Hence , there is judging . Moreover , one may take attitudes toward these objects which may be expressed as running the gamut from love ( attraction ) to hate ( repulsion ) . Hence there is feeling . In a larger sense loving-hating is the motivating source of psychic life . In ideating , something is ideated ; in judging , something is judged ; in feeling , something is felt . Every act refers to an object or content which inexists within it , no matter the kind of act . Despite the ancient sources of Brentano 's system of act psychology , it came as a revolt against established ways of thinking , especially those sponsored by Wundt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stature and point as being clearly in opposition to Wundt 's psychology of content . Wundt saw mind in terms of static elements . He had admitted apperception to his system , but more or less as a reluctant after-thought and not as an integral and primary conceptual tool . Hence , the lines were drawn for a distinction between a psychology of content and a psychology of act , each to have its devoted followers . // In about 1876 a student of philosophy and psychology , browsing at a book stall in Paris , chanced upon a second-hand copy of Fechner 's Elements . The mathematical approach to psychological problems that it contained came as a revelation to young Hermann Ebbinghaus . From his reading of this book arose his greatest intellectual feat ? a conviction that the strictly scientific measurement that I " echner had carried through with psychophysics could also be applied to the higher mental processes . Wundt 's recently published Princi-  | pies contained his contention of the impossibility of experimentally studying the higher mental processes . Ebbinghaus was probably familiar with this volume.20 If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not a deterrent . Hermann Ebbinghaus had been born in Barman , near Bonn , in 1850 , the son of a merchant . He had studied history and philology at Bonn and then had moved , first to Halle and thence to Berlin , in the meantime shifting his interests to philosophy . After serving in the army during the Franco-Prussian War , he returned to Bonn for his doctorate in philosophy , writing his dissertation on Hartmann 's philosophy of the unconscious . This was in 1873 . Then followed seven years of independent study , first in Berlin , where he followed the then not unusual practice of the philosopher in studying the sciences . After 1875 , he spent three years in England and France in private study and tutoring . It was during these years that he chanced to discover Fechner 's book . Without a teacher , a university environment , or a laboratory and , indeed , without any inspiration except the general climate of the times , Ebbinghaus plunged into the study of learning and memory , subjects heretofore untouched by measurement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties standing in his way , devised the necessary methods and materials and , using himself as the only subject , carried through the research , which was to eventuate in his monograph , Uber das Gedachtnis.21 He perceived that his self-appointed task required careful preparation and planning . He saw that he could not take over Fechner 's psychophysical methods as they stood , because they would be entirely too slow and cumbersome . Rather , he used a method that was in the spirit of Fechner . Associationists , particularly Brown and Mill , had attached importance to the principle of frequency as a condition of recall . Frequency of repetition of material or number of trials until learning was complete was seen by Ebbinghaus as the essential condition for associations to be formed . He would use the number of repetitions to serve as his measure of learning . Not only was there to be repetition of the same material to the point where it was wholly learned ; there must also be repetition of the task , each time with similar but not identical materials , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In order for variable errors from trial to trial to be cancelled out , Ebbinghaus would use the same procedure again and again , as did Fechner , varying only the particular content to be learned , and then he would find an average measure . In deference to the experiment , he went so far as to regulate his habits , following the same rigorous pattern day after day and learning t he materials always at the same time of the day . He was familiar with the fact that some pieces of poetry or prose can he learned much more easily than others . Associations already formed with such  | materials facilitate learning . Recognizing that differences due to acquaintance with the material to be learned must be eliminated , Ebbinghaus needed homogeneous , equally unfamiliar material for the many learning sessions that he was planning . Thus , although he used poetry and prose to some extent , the majority of his studies were carried out with new materials of his own invention , the nonsense syllables . Two consonants with a vowel between , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All possible combinations of German consonants and vowels were prepared by him , and each one was put on a separate card . This gave him a reservoir of 2,300 nonsense syllables from which to draw at random to form lists to be learned . The following specific procedure is representative of what he did . Cards for the twelve syllables on a particular list would be read through by him at a uniform rate of two-fifths of a second ( controlled by the ticking of a watch ) . When the reading of the list was completed , there was a pause of fifteen seconds , which he used for recording the trial . Again and again he would read through the cards until he believed he could repeat them without mistake . At this point he would try to recite them without looking at the cards . If he failed , no matter how few the mistakes , he would record the errors ; and then he would read them again . This procedure he continued until he could give the complete list of nonsense syllables from memory without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the method of " complete mastery , " as it came to be called . He now passed on to other lists of syllables . After a given lapse of time , an hour , a day , or a week , whatever his schedule called for , he would return to the originally learned list , and ascertain the number of repetitions now necessary to relearn it again for complete mastery . There would be a saving in the sense that relearning did not take so many readings as originally . This came to be called the " savings method . " Thus if sixteen readings were at first necessary to reach the complete mastery of one correct run-through , and relearning the material twenty-four hours later took only eight readings , then the savings was eight-sixteenths or 50 per cent , a measure of what had been remembered for twenty-four hours . The very first relearning trial also gave him another measure of memory . When the time came to test this first memory of a given list of nonsense syllables , he would find out how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The number still known divided by the total learned was this measure of memory . Suppose twelve syllables were originally learned . At the first relearning trial , say a day later , he remembered four of the nonsense syllables . That meant that four-twelfths or 33 per cent was retained . From these experiments came the well-known Ebbinghaus curve of forgetting . One of the conditions he studied experimentally was the effect of varying  | lengths of the time since learning the lists of nonsense syllables . The material turned out to be forgotten very rapidly in the first few hours and then more and more slowly thereafter . When the results were plotted on a chart , they formed a curve that went down very sharply at first , then gradually leveled off . If the material was " overlearned " ( that is to say , if Ebbinghaus went beyond bare learning by repeating the material to the point of several correct series in the original learning , instead of one ) the material was forgotten more slowly . Under these circumstances the plot of the curve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable lapse of time would show more retention of the material than the learning to merely one correct repetition . Later research confirmed these findings.22 After carefully verifying these and many other findings by repetition , Ebbinghaus finally published his monograph in 1885 . In 1880 , while still carrying on his research in memory , he became Dozent at Berlin , and a year after his research appeared , in 1886 , he was advanced to a rank equivalent to that of assistant professor . During this period he founded the Berlin psychological laboratory , but it was small and not well supported . Ebbinghaus left the field for others to develop . In 1890 , in collaboration with Arthur Konig , he founded the Zeitschrift fur Psychologie and Physiologic der Sinnesorgane , a journal that was badly needed to represent psychology outside the sphere of Wundt 's Studien . It is plausible to believe23 relative lack of publication was the reason behind his failure to be advanced in academic rank at Berlin to a full professorship . At any rate , in 1894 , when Carl Stumpf came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesser post in the hierarchy of German universities at Breslau where he founded another laboratory . Here he made his second major contribution , which , although not at the level of eminence of his studies of learning , deserves mention . The school officials of the city of Breslau called upon him to help in solving a problem of fatigue in school children , i.e. , to find the time of the continuous five-hour school day at which the child was least efficient . Accordingly , he devised three tests to be given in a few minutes before each class period.24 The first and second were rapid addition and multiplication and a test of memory for digits . The third , the " completion method , " which was original with Ebbinghaus , was destined to have pronounced usefulness in the intelligence tests to come . Ebbinghaus argued that mental ability demands , among other capacities , the ability to combine verbal material into a significant whole . Essentially , the test consists of omitting words ( or portions of words ) from sentences in a story and asking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example in the spirit of the original ones used is " Big things are heav  | than things " with the missing syllable and word to be supplied by the child . When the students were grouped by scholastic standing into good , average , or poor , the results from the completion test proved markedly superior in discriminating among the groups when compared with the results from the other two tests . Ebbinghaus argued that this measure showed the great importance of a combining function in intelligence . The fatigue problem , the impetus for the study , it might be added , was largely lost sight of , with the question still left open so far as the report went . Alfred Binet , 25 the pioneer in the development of intelligence tests , acknowledged that the success of the Ebbinghaus Completion Test had encouraged him in his conviction that he should use complex tasks to measure intelligence , rather than simpler ones , such as tapping rate or reaction time , hitherto used with little success . Ebbinghaus wrote two very successful books . His general text Die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a shorter sketch , Abriss der Psychologie27 was issued in 1908 . They became a tremendous success , in their sprightliness and lucidity of style , resembling the Psychology of James . In fact , demands for repeated revisions interfered with their author 's other activities . The first sentence of the Abriss was that often quoted , beguiling half truth , " Psychology has a long past , but only a short history . " 28 Ebbinghaus was acutely aware that experimental psychology had just begun . He had seen its beginnings in the work of Fechner , Helmholtz , and Wundt , all carried out not more than fifty years before the time at which he wrote and most of it practically contemporaneous with his own work . Present perspective , removed in time from these pioneering days , makes it possible to see that pre-experimental contributions were also necessary and that they , too , formed an essential part of the history of psychology . Experimental psychology , as we know it , had had but a short history , psychology a very , very long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Generally in good health , he contracted pneumonia and died suddenly in 1909 at fifty-nine years of age . Ebbinghaus published relatively little , although what he did publish was important . Moreover , he made no systematic contributions . In fact , he can not he said to have had a system . Nevertheless , he made an important contribution . Before Ebbinghaus , the associationists had speculated on how associations were established . Ebbinghaus started by forming these associations experimentally and then testing their resistance by later recall . At first it might be thought that what he did was but a small contribution compared to all the sweeping claims of his predecessors . In the perspective of modern research , these earlier  | claims are seen as grandiose , rather than great . True , they took in much more territory than did Ebbinghaus . They might be compared to monarchs who added to a statement of their holdings , " and the lands beyond the seas , " without occupying these lands . Ebbinghaus not only occupied the territory , he tilled the soil . Finding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original though it may be , is not his major claim to be mentioned in a history of the great psychologists . Rather , it is his determination to control factors so as to eliminate sources of error and to quantify his results as precisely as possible . He did such careful work in his studies of memory that they are quoted to this very day in contemporary textbooks side by side with later studies , not as of historical interest , but as valid and accurate research findings . GEORGE ELIAS MULLER George Elias Muller ( 1850-1.934 ) , a student of Herman Lotze , was a physiologist and philosopher with psychological interests . That Muller was not a student of Wundt 's meant that , free of immediate proximity to this overpowering figure , he was able to develop an independent program . In a sense he was a rival of Wundt . Muller became Professor at Gottingen in 1881 , succeeding Lotze , and held that post for forty years until 1921 . Over the years he attracted a number of students , the more prominent of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Edgar Rubin . Muller undertook extensive criticism and extension of Fechner 's work in psychophysics in his Zur Grundlegung der Psychophysik29 published in 1878 and in Die Gesichtspunkte and die Tatsachen der psycho-physischen Methodik30 in 1904 . In particular he demonstrated that the fluctuations of the threshold in the same person from day to day are not due to error but are real fluctuations in sensitivity itself . He laid down what he considered to be the fundamental psychophysical axioms of the relations between perception and neural excitation as expressed in a parallelistic fashion . ( See page 262 . ) While he also spent many years on problems of color , it is research in learning for which he is most noteworthy . He was among the first psychologists to work in the research field of learning and memory opened up by Ebbinghaus . He carefully verified and extended Ebbinghaus ' findings , which had taken the objective approach exclusively.3 ' He had , for example , found how many trials it took for him to learn or relearn , but he had not recorded introspections about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubted that Ebbinghaus ' account of learning , which made it appear to be a mechanical and automatic process , was correct as it stood . Accordingly , he added introspective report while applying the  | methods of Ebbinghaus and found that , instead of their learning mechanically , the subjects are very active , using groupings and rhythms , finding meanings even in nonsense materials , and , in general , consciously organizing the material . He believed that this activity not only shows that learning is not mechanical , but also that it requires the combination of introspective and objective methods . He concluded that association by contiguity is not enough to account for learning . An active search for relations is also taking place . A " preparatory set " ( Anlage ) influences the memory processes . Muller demonstrated that judgment involves not only the expected images , sensations , and feelings , but also mental events incapable of thus being classified . For example , readiness , hesitation , and doubt seem to be present , a class of mental phenomena usually called " conscious attitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Wurzburg Laboratory under Oswald Kulpe . Muller also worked through many other learning problems and made methodological improvements and increased the precision of the equipment used in its study . It was he , along with a collaborator , Friedrich Schumann , 32 who introduced the familiar revolving drum for uniform presentation of nonsense syllables used since that time in various adaptations for countless studies of memory and learning . This is a small matter , perhaps , but , since it increases objectivity and precision , is not unworthy of mention . // Oswald Kulpe ( 1862-1915 ) already has been encountered as a student and assistant to Wundt . After studying with G. E. Muller at Gottingen , he had received his degree at Leipzig and had remained on as Dozent and assistant in the laboratory . His book34 published in 1893 and translated in 1895 as Outlines of Psyrhology , 35 significantly bears the subtitle , based upon the results of experimental investigation . He wrote clearly and attractively , but he was still under the shadow of Wundt . Only one aspect of his distinctive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the subtractive procedure on reaction time . In 1894 , Kiilpe became Professor at Wurzburg where by 1896 he had founded a laboratory with the aid of private funds . Its progress was such that in a few years it could be referred to as the outstanding laboratory in Curnuiny after Leipzig . Charming and friendly , Kulpe attracted many students and visitors , including several Americans , among them ? J. R. Angell of ; hicago , R. M. Ogden of Cornell , W. L. Bryan of Indiana , and W. B. Pillsbury of Cornell and Michigan . hi'iipc 's distinctive work in psychology ; rose from his conviction , contrary  | to Wundt 's , that the thought processes can be studied experimentally . Most of the Wurzburg studies were not themselves performed by Kulpe ; but he was the professor , with all that this meant in a German university of that day , and frequently he served as a subject in the experiments of his students . There was enough integration for it to be correct to speak of this collective effort as the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kulpe and the members of his school , meant performance of some complex task , such as that involved in thinking or remembering or judging , about which they afterward rendered a retrospective report of their experiences during the original operation . It was systematic in the sense that the whole experience was described methodically , time-period by time-period , thus fractionating it . This procedure contrasted vividly with the description of immediate experience demanded by Wundt . To use the Wurzburg version of introspection , one must think , memorize , or judge , and then turn around and examine how he thought , memorized , or judged . That to which he was to attend was not specified in advance , as it was with Wundtian introspection , so the subject at Wurzburg did not know beforehand exactly what he was to observe . Closely identified with the Wurzburg School is the conception of what came to be called in English , " imageless thought " ? the representation of meanings in thinking which did not seem to be carried by specific images . Watt , Baler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied many instances of how , while thinking of a definite problem or reaching a conclusion , they did so without their being aware of having any specific mental content of the sort previously identified . Another feature of this work was the emphasis on the influence of the task itself to which the subjects are set . A capsule description of two characteristic experiments is in order . Marbe , 36 in a study of judgment of weights , found that while sensations and images were present as usual , their presence told nothing about how the subjects made their judgments . The subjects just judged a weight as heavier or as lighter , usually being right , but simply did not know how they did it , in the sense that the sensations and images they reported did not describe the process of how they reached their judgment . Watt37 studied association in a variety of ways . For example , his subjects were faced with finding a subordinate or superordinate for the word bird . They reacted correctly , but often without being conscious that they intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done earlier , not after the stimulus was presented , but before when the instructions were understood . Once understood , it would seem that the subject thereafter gave the response  | to the stimulus without conscious effort . To account for such findings , Watt emphasized the concept of task ( Aufgabe ) . The subjects did not think of the task as , say , of searching for the superordinate of bird and arriving at animal ; they just thought " animal . " The conscious phenomena he obtained in the introspection corresponded closely to the volitional variable previously spoken of in connection with Kulpe 's early work . Although terms similar in nature are used now more or less indiscriminately for any potentiality in consciousness , for Watt , task meant the purpose , or conscious task , that precedes a later unconscious course of events . The conscious task ( Aufgabe ) brings about an unconscious set ( Einstellung ) in the subject . Watt ( and Ach ) in research related to the study of association held that the organism had a set , or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determining tendency " to react in the way the given instruction called for . If , in advance of exposure to material , one has decided to subtract , seeing a " 6 " and a " 4 , " produces the response " 2 , " not " 10 , " which a determining tendency to add would have produced to the same visual stimuli . Once the task has been accepted and the set has been adopted , the actual performance runs off with remarkably little conscious content to be found during it . These determining tendencies , not present consciously during performance , seemed important in volitional activities . The Wurzburgers were suggesting that predispositions outside of consciousness act to control consciousness . This work on thought elements was negative in the sense that the studies stressed their finding of something which lacked sensory content . It was not until the work of Karl Biihler in 1907 and 1908 that a new element in consciousness was announced.38 His method of conducting introspections was even freer than that of systematic experimental introspection . He used very complicated problems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such that always they were to be answered first with a " yes " or " no . " After answering affirmatively or negatively , the subject gave the fullest possible account of the experiences by which he reached his decision , with questions interjected from time to time by the experimenter . Illustrative are : " Was the theorem of Pythagoras known in the Middle Ages ? " " Can we with our thought comprehend the nature of thought ? " or , my favorite , " The smaller the woman 's foot , the larger the bill for shoes ? " 39 The subjects ( including Kiilpe ) in their introspections used such terms as " awareness of a consciousness that , " but more frequently simply referred to them as " thoughts . " Thought was the new ( lenient that Biihler claimed must be accepted if his results were to make any sense . I le went on to describe three types of thoughts ? consciousness of rule , c ? on.S ( ionsn ( ( ss of relation , and intention . The first type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solving mathematical , logical , or grammatical  | problems . The second occurred when several parts of a thought required a relation to be established as consequence or opposition , and the third took place when a problem was seen over-all and an outcome was to be reached . It must be emphasized that , while opposed to the Wundtian position concerning the sensory nature of certain kinds of conscious experience , Kiilpe and the others were still seeking to find new elements in thought . They were still analytical in their approach . Their use of analytical methods did not render their interpretations acceptable to the Wundtian psychologists of content who considered what they were doing as a caricature of psychology . The reports of their introspections , particularly those of Biihler , drew vigorous opposition , especially from Wundt , 4 ? who offered scathing criticism , calling their procedures " mock " experiments and arguing that what they called experimental introspection was neither experimental nor introspective . Recollection of what Wundt meant by these operations will show the logical rigor of his criticism , even though one may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning to encompass the work of the Wurzburg School . Of course , a distinction such as that between the warring views of the Wurzburg School and Wundt is never as clean-cut as enthusiasts would like to believe . Wundt had spoken of apperception , even though he can hardly be said to have stressed it . From the perspective of today , it can be seen that the views of the Wurzburgers and Wundt were not incompatible . After all , the conscious attitudes or preparatory sets of G. E. Muller had been demonstrated without creating a furor or outright rejection within the ranks of the psychologists of content . In fact , as a student of Muller as well as Wundt , Kulpe had probably been influenced by him . But the temperaments of the critics of the Wurzburg School would not permit a reconciliation . Kulpe , for his part , both then and later , showed his high admiration and regard for Wundt . Muller also attacked Kulpe 's methods and results , as did Titchener , a friend and companion from Kulpe 's Leipzig days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue had been forced , and a rival school was consequently established . Kulpe 's own interpretation of the work from his laboratory is rather hard to specify . He wrote very little on the matter , and his contemplated description of the psychology of the thought processes was never completed . Kulpe 's fifteen years at Wurzburg are his most important for the history of psychology . It was not that he lost interest later , for at Bonn , where he went next , he founded a laboratory ; and , in 1913 , when he moved to Munich , he saw to it that the laboratory allocated to his predecessor was suitably equipped . It was rather that his continuing interests in philosophical prohlenis ,  | particularly in esthetics , which in no way did he conceive as antagonistic to his interests in psychological issues , came to the fore . He sought to prove that the actualities of conscious experience required that there be independent objects for them to have any significance . He never completed the statement of his later views . His student Karl Buhler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What he had covered in the Grundriss in 1893 constituted in this new work the content of psychology ; the contribution of the Wurzburg School was what he called function . The psychological implications of these views led him to a position much closer to that of Brentano . By now Kulpe conceived of psychology as including both content and act ( although he called the latter , function ) and it is to be regretted he did not live long enough to work out fully his own synthesis . To Kulpe42 content and function both are facts of mental life because they can be demonstrated to be different . They are separable in experience : in dreams there is content but little function ; in " barely " noticing something there is function with little content . They are independently variable : content changes without function when one perceives objects one after the other ; function changes when one object is first perceived , then recognized , and then judged . They possess characteristic differences : contents are analyzable in consciousness , observable in introspection , and relatively stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the function ) , observable in retrospection only , and relatively unstable . They obey different laws ; the laws of content are association , fusion , contrast , and a relation to stimulus and sense organ ; function includes the effects of the laws of determining tendency . Kulpe was actively engaged in this combined psychological and epistemological enterprise on his death in 1915 , The work of the Wurzburg School was prophetic of developments of a holistic view as it was to be differentiated from the elementalist view of Wundt . Indeed , the Gestalt psychologists who were to come later owe a debt to Kulpe for attempting to deal both with act and content . The results of the Wurzburg School were interpreted as they relate to thought as such , which was their own emphasis . But two other aspects of their thinking are significant today . First , there was the emphasis they gave to volition or motivation as we would call it . Task , set , determining tendency , to use their key words , have a motivational connotation today . Motivation was treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a topic that is very much a part of the modern scene in psychology . The relatively simple kinds of association of the British and of Wundt were not enough to explain the variations in volition that they found from one experiment to the next . Second , it seemed as if behavior depended not only upon the elements  | present in the subject 's consciousness but also upon the way he adjusted to the experiment , even though he was not aware of their operation in conscious analysis . These directive tendencies were not present directly in consciousness . They were often unconscious in nature . Unconscious determinants of behavior were being demonstrated . Members of the Wurzburg School were working at the same time as Freud , but they did not have his ruthless radicalism to cut through to the bold conclusion that many of the experiences with which they were dealing were unconscious . Instead , they treated these impalpable phenomena with which they were struggling as being a consequence of some vague conscious element . Freud was a greater man than Kulpe . Kulpe and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychology during the second half of the nineteenth century as well as the beginnings of the breakdown of the national boundaries through Wundt 's students from the United States . Before considering still later developments , it is necessary to return to England to the time just after the Mills and Bain in the middle of the nineteenth century . REFERENCES* 1 . O.

BORING , op . Cit. , pp. 451-452.  | A FAITH in the timelessness of nature was still accepted by a great majority of men , learned and unlearned alike , in the first half of the nineteenth century . There was , however , a substantial minority who had some conception of an evolutionary process . The fundamental idea of evolution , that living things do change with time , was not new , having been a part of the intellectual history of man since Anaximandros , a contemporary of Thales . In the centuries before Darwin , the philosophers and scientists of the Enlightenment , Locke , Hume , and Diderot , for example , had spoken of only small gradations separating plants , animals , and men , as well as of generation and transformation . Philosophers , such as Kant and Hegel , had written of developwent in a fashion not incompatible with evolution . Lyell had introduced evolution into geological theory ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on evolution , and , in 1809 , the very year of Charles Darwin 's birth , Lamarck ' had published a work on his theory that the great variety ( if animal species was to be explained by the inheritance of acquired characters , such as may be brought about by change in the environment or through the use or disuse of a part of the body . Herbert Spencer , moreover , was championing an evolutionary point of ' view prior to Darwin 's publication in 1859 of The Origin of Species . Nevertheless , it was the work of Darwin which p 300 created a veritable scientific revolution which demanded an intellectual reorganization in the thinking of mankind . After 1859 no well-informed thinker , not blinded by preconceptions , religious or otherwise , could ignore the fact that for all biological phenomena , a genetic , as well as a cross-sectional view of their nature was imperative . DARWIN AND EVOLUTION The theory of evolution advanced by Charles Darwin ( 1809-1882 ) is too well known to require more than a reminder of its most salient features . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a fixed , immutable form and that the spontaneous variability which each species demonstrate is inheritible . There is a struggle for survival , and the forms that survive are the ones that have made the successful adaptations to those inexorable difficulties that they have had to face . The exigencies of the struggle for existence under natural conditions accomplish what every animal breeder who practices artificial selection knows ? that certain strains are perpetuated by breeding . Only those forms fittest for their particular environment survived this process of natural selection , the rest died out . Man was no exception to this process . He , too , is the result of this struggle . Darwin believed that the variations that were perpetuated were always slight . Through later research on the mutation of genes , it is now known that the variations are often abrupt and of considerable magnitude . But this later finding does not detract from Darwin 's theory concerning the process of evolution . He demonstrated the process and the range of the reasons for it , but not its genetic mechanism . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass of data which Darwin had collected . Much miscellaneous biological information , hitherto unrelated , was organized by Darwin in such a fashion that his theory and conclusions appeared irresistible to those persons who did not find in it anything antagonistic to their deep laid convictions . As Thomas Huxley3 said of himself , " How extremely stupid not to have thought of that . " And he was not alone . There were many who saw in Darwin 's evidence a means of organizing and understanding a great mass of otherwise puzzling data . In relating the Darwinian evolutionary doctrine to religious orthodoxy , fertile sources of controversy appear . Theological disagreement was inevitable , as were arguments from all others who saw man as separated by an impassible gulf from the " brutes . " Moreover , there were those who saw in Darwin 's work contradictory scientific evidence . The stormy controversy which broke out was one from which Darwin himself held aloof  --  his temperament was such  | that speaking sharply to some one made him unable to sleep . He found , however , able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The protest and acrimony died hard , stretching from 1860 in the debate of Huxley and Bishop Wilberforce of Oxford to the Scopes trial with the antagonists , William Jennings Bryan and Clarence Darrow in 1925 . Darwin 's second major report on evolution , The Descent of Man , 4 appeared in 1871 . It was written primarily to present the evidence that the conclusions of the Origin had applied to man , a position he had held all along , but which had not been understood by some contemporaries . Moreover , in the Origin he had not tried to apply his conclusions to a species taken singly . Now he marshalled the evidence for the evolution of man from some lower form , along with evidence about his subsidiary theme of sexual selection . Darwin made more specific contributions to psychology . He kept a diary of his infant son , which he began in 1840 but did not publish until 1877.5 Along with similar work by Preyer , this record was one of the sources for the beginnings of modern child psychology . Darwin also studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the anatomist already familiar because of his differentiation of function in sensory and motor nerves , had held that facial movements used in the expression of emotions are primarily expressive , that is to say , their function is to express emotions.6 Darwin upheld the alternative theory , that facial movements are originally practical , as when an angry dog bares his teeth in action preparatory to biting. ? Expressive functions , Darwin believed , may be derived subsequently from practical functions . To present his argument , he developed three principles of emotional expression , and he gave illustrations . The first , the principle of serviceable associated habits , was that many expressive movements in emotion are vestiges of originally practical movements . A sneer was seen as a remnant of a response to a malodorous substance , clenching the fists as a vestige of preparation for combat , and startle as a remainder of a larger flight reaction . The second , the principle of antithesis , was that opposite impulses tend to show opposed movements . When a cat shows affection by arching her back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pointing her ears , these are all movements the opposite of which she would make when about to attack or defend herself . Antithesis is to be found in laughter , which requires expiration of breath , while sobbing , the opposite , requires inspiration . The third principle has to do with the direct action of the nervous system . There is the overflow into motor channels that we call " trelnbli lg . " These expressive characteristics were acquired from prior practical functions . they then could be inherited . This assumption , of course , wits more in line with I , anlarckian inheritance of acquired characters than  | what is often considered to be Darwinian evolutionary theory . However , he is quite explicit in stating directly that these were originally voluntary movements which turned into reflex actions through continued habits , which are then inherited . Something should now be said about Darwin 's more general and less direct influences upon the field of psychology . Among the more important of these were his emphasis upon drives to action , his making clear the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attention to individual differences . The study of lower animals was shown by Darwin to demand consideration of their drives to action . Study seemed always to lead to an examination of the causes of their activity . Often even their more complicated activities appeared to be free of the influence of learning . To these activities the term instincts had already been applied . An important chapter of the Origin had been devoted to the topic of instincts , in which Darwin compared and contrasted instinct with habit and showed that instincts are not perfect . There was available to Darwin a variety of accounts of the instincts of animals , particularly domesticated animals , for example , the shepherd 's dogs ' tendency to hunt hares , the brooding of hens , and cell-making of bees . These behaviors can best be understood as inherited . Darwin 's evidence showed that , if the animals did not have the proper instincts , they did not survive . Evolutionary theory forced a recognition of the essentiality of understanding the drives to action of both man and beast . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In effect , Darwin had demonstrated that all animals were related , and that they all faced the common problem of adjustment and survival . In The Descent of Man , he emphasized the similarity of reasoning in man to what appeared to be similar processes in the lower animals . More specifically , he attempted to show that many of man 's mental capacities had rudimentary prototypes among lower animals . He also appealed to accounts of primitive man , as for example , their susceptability to praise and blame . If the human body evolved from lower animals , does it not also follow that the human mind developed from more primitive minds ? If all animals are related , does it not follow that there will be similarities in behavior and mentality among animals ? It was on the basis of such questions as these that the comparative viewpoint in psychology came into being . Psychology was made ready to return to tIir ' wisdom of Aristotle , to be concerned with all living things , not with man alone . After Darwin , comparative psychology came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant and interesting , individual differences in hhvsical  | forms between animal species and , to some extent , within species . This discovery was to lead to the study of individual and racial psychological differences . Great as was Darwin 's work , he was not a great psychologist . Rather , as was the case with Galileo and with Newton before him , his service was to reorganize the scientific view and to stimulate others in other sciences , psychology included . It was , however , Darwin 's work which stimulated an interest in these psychological problems . The vehicle for the almost entirely new aspect of psychology , the field of individual differences , was Francis Galton . FRANCIs GALTON Francis Galton was the pioneer who brought about a union between psychological methods of measurement and the theory of evolution , a union that came about because Galton 's studies and observations initiated considerable interest in the study of individual differences among men . Life ' Francis Galton , a cousin of Charles Darwin , was born near Birmingham in 1822 . His large family possessed considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military officers , M.P . ' s , and landed gentry . This background afforded Galton connections with a large number of important persons in England at the height of the British Empire . In his autobiography , 9 Galton studs his pages with mention of names either in terms of indices of their progression through life or about their family connections . For instance , he refers to " Sir Joseph ( then Mr. ) Hooker " , to " Henry Fitzmaurice Hallam ... the younger son of the historian Henry Hallam . . . and brother to Arthur Hallam ... , the subject of Tennyson 's In Memoriam , " and even to his wife as the daughter of the " Dean of Peterborough , previously headmaster of I larrow . . . and before his appointment , the Senior Wrangler at Cambridge . ... " In his day , " the establishment " may have referred to the relation of church and state , but its modern meaning was very much in evidence . It is not denying his great gifts to say that a way of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conviction that eminence runs in families . True , others , before and after , merely accepted this state of affairs , but Galton had the genius to see the obvious . Following his own and his family 's wishes , in 1838 he began as an apprentice to study medicine in Birmingham General Hospital . He rolled pills , made up medicines , attendee ) rounds , and participated in first aid in the accident room .  | Boldly curious as he was always to be , he decided to find out for himself the effects of the different medicines . Commencing with those under the letter A in the pharmacopoeia he began taking small doses of each , one after the other . He had reached nearly the end of the letter C when stopped by the effects of croton oil , notorious as an extremely powerful purgative . After completing a period of experience at this Hospital , he continued some of his medical training at King 's College , London . In 1840 Galton changed his plans and enrolled in Trinity College , Cambridge , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had managed to keep up in mathematics , the field in which he specialized . He had occasion to wonder at one form of narrowness of the academic horizon of Cambridge of that time ? faculty and the students alike showed no interest at all in what he had learned about biology from his medical education . After a severe mental breakdown had interrupted his studies , he took his degree without working for honors . In 1845-46 , he travelled in the Sudan , and in 1850 he explored Damaraland and the Ovampo country in Southwest Africa . On his return he published accounts of his travels . The novelty and the danger of these trips is manifest when we note that the second trip was taken more than twenty years before the meeting of Stanley and Livingston . In 1854 , the Royal Geographical Society awarded him one of their two annual gold medals for exploring the then unknown country of central Southwest Africa . Subsequently , he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on the same grounds . A spirit of adventure seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later in life these moods occurred . He tells in his autobiography that one way he came to know John Tyndall , the physicist , was to go on climbing expeditions with him , where he would give in to Tyndall 's claim that it is easy to find difficult ( i.e. , dangerous ) places to climb , even in England . In 1853 he married . Again he was immersed in a large and distinguished family , since his wife , besides her three sisters , had four brothers , all noted for scholastic or administrative ability . Travelling annually to the continent , visiting at one or another of the houses of his friends , and living in London occupied some of his time . Exploration had become a topic of wide-spread interest , so he devoted his attention to the preparation of a book ? The Art of Travel , a practical guide for the explorer . He also gave lectures on the art of camp life to soldiers in training for the Crimean War . For several years he tried the life of a country gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Scotland , meanwhile managing his estate , adding the not too incongruous touch to this particular picture by experimenting with electricity .  | He then turned to the serious study of meteorology . The book that summarizes his findings is said 1 ? to be the first serious attempt to chart the weather on an extensive scale and to contain the first establishment of the existence of anti-cyclones . His health gave him much concern , especially since a not infrequent reaction to his ill health was the tremendous difficulty in carrying through intellectual activities . Severe bouts of fever also would come unexpectedly . Mental Inheritance It was during the early sixties that Galton was stirred by his cousin 's Origin of Species to study anthropology and heredity , an interest which resulted in the founding of the field of eugenics . Galton wished to encourage the pro-ductivity of the fit while restricting the birth rate of the unfit . To do so , he undertook to demonstrate that human heredity is important and relevant . He wished to study the inherited transmissible qualities of men and hoped that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His first publication in this area was a magazine article on hereditary talent and character in 1865 . In 1869 , just ten years after the Origin , the first edition of Hereditary Genius appeared . ' 1 The range of human mental power from the highest to the lowest was held to be enormous . Galton not only marshalled evidence about superior persons but also referred briefly to the mentally retarded and mentioned in passing the work of Seguin with idiots and imbeciles . Once variability in ability is accepted we come to the major issue : Is ability related to heredity ? He specifically acknowledged in his preface to Hereditary Genius that on considering his contemporaries at school and in later life he was surprised to find how frequently ability seemed to go by descent . Most of his book is occupied with reporting a large quantity of biographical data about eminent men . Since , in a later edition , 12 he expressed regret at having used the word , " genius , " when he really meant mental ability of high order , we shall use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was not only a general tendency for eminence to run in certain families , but also that there are specific forms of eminence in the sciences , in the arts , in jurisprudence , and in similar fields . Calton selected the eminent men by the use of biographical sources and then found the number of eminent relations they had . The proportion of eminent relatives that he located much exceeded that to be expected by chance . There were 977 eminent men in his main sample , each judged as being so outstanding as to be one man in 4,000 . By chance the group would have had only one prominent relative . Instead they had 332 close relatives about  | as eminent as themselves . Although upheld later in a general way , his specific results are subject to many forms of serious criticism.13 In his own day , his results were taken as unequivocal evidence for the biological inheritance of mental ability . It has become evident since that his demonstration of eminence running in families can be interpreted as due , in part at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and proximity to other eminent ( and influential ) men . Galton did not entirely overlook the influence of the environment . In fact , for this reason he later made the first psychologically oriented research study of twins in which he endeavored to separate the influence of heredity and environment . He found that in physical characteristics , at least , twins had much more in common with each other than did other non-twin children of the same parents . His essential thesis in all of this was that mental characteristics are inherited in the same fashion and at the same rate as are physical characteristics . He converted his cousin to this view that intellectual ability is inherited , since Charles Darwin explicitly stated in a letter of 1869 to him that on reading Hereditary Genius , he had been " made a convert since previously he had believed that excepting fools , men did not differ much in intellect , only in zeal and hard work .... " 14 Statistics and Correlation Before Galton became interested in statistics , Quetelet15 ( 1796-1874 ) , the Belgian astronomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Scottish soldiers and the heights of French conscripts and found , in effect , that these two sets of measures not only showed the same shape of distribution when plotted on a graph , but also that they both followed the same shape of distribution as did plots of runs of luck at a gaming table , and the spread of shot around a target . Graphically speaking , each of these measures when plotted formed a curve which resembles many other common measures with a peak in the center of the distribution , while on each side the scores fall off symmetrically in such a fashion as to make the curve . Laplace and Gauss before him had applied mathematical principles to data on human errors ; Quetelet extended their normal law of error to measures other than errors . It was Quetelet 's work with which Galton first became familiar . What Of let el et had demonstrated was that human variation in physique follows the same statistical laws as do certain other living and non-living phenomena . Inspired by Quetelet , Galton took the next step by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that marks given on carefully  | administered and lengthy university honors examinations followed the same distribution as did the biological measures studied by Quetelet.16 Galton saw these results not only as interesting in themselves but also as justifying the application of statistics to psychological measures . He went further and developed one of the most important of all statistical measures , the correlation . In 1888 he gave a report 17 that described for the first time what he called " co-relations , " as well as the working-out of several of the basic procedures . He presented by means of graphs the fundamental properties of the correlation coefficient , as we now term it , and even developed a formula for its calculation although it was soon superseded . Galton applied his method to variations in bodily measurements , showing that , for example , stature and head length , and head length and head breadth , were correlated . For instance , tall stature and long head length go together , as do short stature and short head length , and also the various dimensions between . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was with Galton 's encouragement and aid that his student Karl Pearson later improved on his work and gave rise to the present mathematical formula for its calculation , the so-called Pearson product-moment coefficient of correlation . This formula worked out by Pearson allowed one to calculate the precise numerical degree of relationship . The values that are to be found range between nearly perfect correlations through zero to nearly perfect inverse correlations. ' $ The latter occurs when an increase in one score is accompanied by decrease in the other measure . The correlation was to prove an exceedingly useful tool because it made it possible to state results of research in quantitative terms , such as , .30 or .61 , instead of qualitatively as in , " some , but not a great deal of relationship . " This formula is now applied regularly , not just in psychology alone , but in all fields where statistics are used . Galton 's Versatility For a time after writing Hereditary Genius , Galton was absorbed in collecting measures of physical characteristics ? height , circumference of head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the middle seventies that he came to the conclusion that static , anthropometric measures like those just mentioned were not so fruitful to understanding diversity among individuals as are psychometric or psychological measures which get at how individuals function . Gallon moved from physical anthropology to psychology . his psychological contributions are contained in his Inquiries into Human Faculty and its 1 ) erehy ent , 10 appearing in 1883 and based upon work which had occupied hint for at least the previous seven years . This collection of  | studies is of striking originality . However it includes no attempt to unify its contents beyond the theme stated in its title and certain implicit general methodological guide lines which can be inferred ? human beings vary enormously , man is a biologically rooted organism that evolved , empiricism is the road to knowledge , observations may be quantified and statistics applied to the results . The appearance of this book gives us an opportunity to pause and specify some of Galton 's diverse contributions as they appeared in the Inquiries and later , reserving for a more detailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we find articles on spectacles for divers , the breeding of rabbits , gregariousness in cattle , a statistical analysis of the efficacy of prayer , visualized movement , composite portraitures , color blindness , outfitting an anthropometric laboratory , the Australian marriage system , dice for statistical experiments , arithmetic by smell , and the speed of trotting horses . Galton tells how , as a means of studying the diversity of association , 21 he walked along Pall Mall , a distance of about 450 yards . He found that he had developed numerous associations with nearly 300 objects . A few days later he repeated the walk and again was struck with the variety of ideas that welled up , although somewhat chastened by the realization that there was considerable repetition of those associations shown on the first occasion . He compares these associations to a procession of players , who , having once marched across the stage , went round by the back to come on again , giving the impression of a larger group than there really was . On another occasion he tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He hit upon the plan of consciously trying to invest everything human , animal , and inanimate he met on a walk with the attributes of a spy . By the end of the morning stroll , every horse seemed to be watching him either directly or , what was just as suspicious , they were disguising their espionage by elaborately paying no attention ! Hours had to pass before this state of mind wore off , and later he discovered it was all too easy to reinstate.22 On still another occasion he wished to gain some appreciation of the feeling that a savage might have for his idol , so he selected the drawing of Punch , the traditional cover of that magazine , and pretended with all the fervor that he possessed that it was something with divine attributes , having the power to reward or to punish.23 He was so successful in empathizing with his role that for a long time after the experience he retained for this picture a feeling that a barbarian might have for his idol . For Galton nothing was too trivial to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fidgets , per unit of time , as a measure of boredom . I le familiarized himself with the ways of wild animals by visiting zoos . It is here he lout to  | good use his invention , the Galton whistle , which gave pitches beyond the audibility of human ears , but not that of various animals . Three of his contributions to psychology deserve more detailed consideration : his work on mental imagery , on association , and on mental tests . As Calton saw them , these problems involved not only the evolutionary principle but the already familiar older and associationistic and sensationistic traditions . Mental Imagery 24 Galton became interested in the problem of visual mental imagery because he thought demonstrations of its presence in varying degrees might help to establish an essential difference in the mental operations of different men . After some preliminary inquiries , he constructed a questionnaire which he had completed both by students and by men from the various professions . It contained specifications for various situations for which they were to try to elicit images . The most famous of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene of their breakfast table that morning . His subjects were to say whether the image they had was dim or clear , the objects well or ill defined , the colors natural or absent , the extent of contents of the field of view , the steadiness of maintenance of the mental picture , and the like . To his astonishment , many men of science whom he had first questioned about mental images , protested they did not know what he was talking about . They strenuously denied having any imagery . They resembled in this respect color blind persons who did not know of their disability . He accounted for this relative absence of mental imagery in scientists by their habits of highly abstract lines of thinking , considering that , if they ever possessed such imagery , they must have lost it through disuse . At the more general levels of society , and among women , boys , and girls , imagery of a clear , well defined , distinct sort was present . In fact , when Galton feigned disbelief at the answers of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inability to accept such obvious facts as were the scientists by his claim that such images existed . With more returns available , although similar differences persisted , he found numerous exceptions . Some scientists did have vivid imagery ; some persons in the general population lacked imagery . Not infrequently , it is said of Galton that he found distinct imagery types . I Iis preliminary finding about the absence of imagery in scientists may have helped to bring about this belief . As a matter of fact , although he had spoken 01 types in his sunuuarization , Dalton stressed that there was a gradation of clarity of imagery from distinct to faint . It was other workers after him who popularized the notion of iniagery types as if this had been his major  | finding . Careful later work demonstrated that Galton was right , and those who came later were wrong in that imagery falls , not into types , but is more or less normally distributed in the population with the great majority having some , but not a great deal , of imagery . Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which Galton concerned himself was that of association . One phase of his work , the finding of diversity of association , but with repetition , has already been described . This form of study of the free play of his own associations he did not find particularly fruitful . Much more important was his work on the reaction time necessary to produce associations . Words with which to associate , each written on a separate slip , were exposed to his view one at a time . When he had given two associations to each word , he recorded the time taken from a watch . This gave him an association reaction time . He followed the same procedure for each word in turn . Many of his associations were single words , but on some occasions the response took the form of a mental image which to be recorded had to be described in some detail and with many words . He wished to find the probable origin of these associative reactions . Presently it became evident that a large number of the associations came from experiences in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from this period , about 45 per cent from manhood , and only 15 per cent from the immediate past . This was one of the first demonstrations by research of the importance of childhood experience upon subsequent adult thinking . Mental Tests 26 In addition to being the first to study scientifically through estimates of the abilities of eminent men , Galton was also the first to develop certain specific mental tests . In fact he may be said to have invented mental tests ( although not the term itself , for it came later ) . The first phase of his interest in tests was shown in his efforts to develop measures of intelligence based upon sensory capacity , an undertaking that rested on the supposition that discrimination would be highest among the ablest individuals . He offered various anecdotes on the sensory obtuseness of idiots and imbeciles . Galton was using highly contrasting groups , the able on the one hand , the idiots-imbeciles on the oilier , to bring out sensory differences between them . Ile devised a set of weights for lifting and suggested other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie did not collect a great deal of data , hilt he was clearly implying that  | intelligence can be measured and that sensory ability is correlated with intelligence . Not only this test of weight discrimination , but also his measures of association can be seen as mental tests . As early as 188227 Galton established a small laboratory in London where , for payment of a fee , a person could take a battery of tests ? physical measurements , reaction time measurements , and tests of sensory acuity . Each client was given the results , and another copy was kept by the laboratory . Thus Galton , in addition to inventing mental tests , started the world 's first mental testing center and in the process became the first psychological practitioner . He had , however , no intention of trying to do more than break even financially and did not succeed even in that . One of Galton 's works published in 1884,28 brings out very clearly his interest in the measurement of personality . After suggesting somewhat overoptimistically that intellectual performance had been already " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and character had been neglected , he offered a variety of suggestions for the measurement of these latter attributes by the cardiograph , the sphygmograph , and blood pressure apparatus employed to test the effect of small emotional shocks . Among a variety of other suggestions , there is one that bears quoting : The poetical metaphors of ordinary language suggest many possibilities of measurement . Thus when two persons have an " inclination " to one another , they visibly incline or slope together when sitting side by side , as at a dinner table , and they then throw the stress of their weights on the near legs of their chairs . It does not require much ingenuity to arrange a pressure gauge with an index and dial to indicate changes in stress , but it is difficult to devise an arrangement , that shall fulfill the threefold condition of being effective , not attracting notice and being applicable to ordinary furniture . I made some rude experiments , but being busy with other matters , have not carried them on , as I had hoped.29 The article makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human abilities as broadly as possible . If the word " personality " had had the meaning it does today , he surely would have used it . Only a few other details about Galton 's life need recounting . He was knighted in 1909 and died at Haslemere in 1911 . In his will he left funds for the support of a laboratory for the study of eugenics . Such , then , was the varied career of Francis Galton . Evaluation The measurement of individual differences in psychology , it is correct to say , was launched by Calton . Consider the work on the continent at this time . Helmholtz had given up the measurement of reaction time because the times  | varied so much from trial to trial . Wundt was not interested in Cattell 's self-imposed problem of individual differences in reaction time . Galton had the insight to see individual differences , not as a nuisance to be eliminated but as something profoundly important to be investigated for their own sake . He also forged the link between an evolutionary and developmental outlook and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He made the first extensive use of the questionnaire for psychological research . For these reasons , Galton is included among the great psychologists . Galton continued the individualistic spirit of English nineteenth-century science . He never had a specialty but ranged broadly over a wide number of fields . He was not a eugenicist , an anthropologist , or even a psychologist ; he was Galton . Like Boyle and Darwin , he never held academic position . The brute fact was that Oxford and Cambridge were only beginning to awaken to the continental scientific spirit . They were far from ready to welcome so young an upstart as psychology , far down in the prestige order of the sciences . In Galton 's case , it is fortunate that he was not confined within the mould of a professorship , where specialization would have been demanded ; yet the advantages of the University were also denied him . There was little of the follow-through in his work that a university setting might well have encouraged . His work ? although he had Karl Pearson as a faithful follower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's profound influence upon him ? did not attract students , as did Wundt 's in Germany . There was no group of enthusiastic followers to carry on his work in psychology and to clean up details and generally bring order to his thinking although in this regard his work in eugenics and biometrics fared somewhat better . HERBERT SPENCER ' Herbert Spencer ( 1820-1903 ) was born in Derby , the son of a schoolmaster . Although tutored by his father , he was otherwise practically self-taught . As a young man he worked as a surveyor and a railroad engineer . He then secured an appointment as a junior editor of the journal , The Economist , and was launched upon his career as a writer , which was to be his means of livelihood thereafter . At this time Spencer contributed numerous articles to the Westminster Review , articles which sketched aspects of what was later to emerge as his philosophical doctrines . He became a friend of many of the leading scientific figures of his age , Huxley , Darwin , and others . Spencer preceded Darwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1840 that he read Lyell 's Principles of Geology , whose arguments against Lamnarck 's theory of the inheritance of acquired characters had the effect of  | leading him to accept Lamarck 's position . As early as 1852 he had definitely disassociated himself from a belief in the immutability of species . He developed an evolutionist doctrine in the years immediately preceding the publication of Darwin 's Origin of Species , but his publications attracted relatively little attention at that time.31 Before Darwin , Spencer 's views were primarily based on philosophical , geological , and anthropological arguments and very little in the way of biological data . When Darwin produced his theory and precipitated a movement , Spencer associated himself with it.32 Once reinforced by the genius of Darwin , Spencer was caught up in the great new trend , though he preserved his independence and remained very much his own man . Darwin had supplied the detailed proof while being very careful not to generalize beyond his data ; in his turn , Spencer supplied a universal application , drawing out the implications of the theory so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavor . Spencer did this through his Synthetic Philosophy , which was a comprehensive system in which he attempted to apply the master concept of evolution to all human knowledge . After failing to secure a state subsidy , he sent out to prospective subscribers a syllabus for his Synthetic Philosophy , eventually to encompass ten volumes , and secured enough money to go ahead with its preparation . Once started on the undertaking , he never wavered , working doggedly towards its completion despite frequent ill health and very little money . Successive parts of The System of Synthetic Philosophy appeared over the period of years from 1862 to 1893 . It opened with the First Principles33 and proceeded through The Principles of Biology , 34 The Principles of Psychology , 35 ( the second edition ) , The Principles of Sociology , 36 and The Principles of Ethics.37 He continued writing and reviewing through a long productive life and died in 1903 . The main outline of his position is rather easy to present in short compass . The nature of reality is unknowable . All philosophy and science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in more restricted areas , while philosophy serves to unify their concepts . The ultimate law of development , which runs through all things , is based upon the principle of the conservation of energy , and the task is to specify how this energy is transformed . There is a unity to all the sciences , and the unity exists in evolution . All existence is evolution . Development of men and the stars involves differentiafollowed by integration . Everything proceeds from homogeneity toward ( heterogeneity . " Evolution , " he said in that famous rolling Victorian sentence , " is an integration of matter and couconcitant dissipation of motion ; during  | which the matter passes from an indefinite , incoherent homogeneity to a definite coherent heterogeneity .... " 38 The physical sciences he dismissed after a very general discussion , leaving himself free thereafter to concentrate on the sciences of man . Biologically , life is an adjustment of internal relations to external conditions . As for psychology itself , consciousness accompanies increased correspondence and better adjustment . With increased complexity of structure , there is increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1835-1911 ) who provided the physiological interpretation for his evolutionary views . As his ardent disciple , he worked out a view that would make the nervous system subject to an evolutionary hierarchy.39 In this conception the opposite of evolution , dissolution , to use as he did , Spencer 's term , accounted for nervous disease in which higher levels were attacked first and only then proceeded to lower levels . This hierarchical view naturally led to less emphasis , if not outright rejection , of exact localization of function in favor of the position that higher and lower levels were involved according to the complexity of function . Spencer gave considerable attention to association , the elements of which he referred to as " feelings , " and " relations between feelings . " 40 A feeling is a portion of consciousness with a perceivable individuality and is not further reducible into elements . A relation between feelings on the other hand occupies no appreciable part of consciousness . Take away the feeling units , and the relations , too , disappear . But feelings and relations between feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will show . " Feelings " include emotions and sensations , the former centrally initiated , the latter peripherally initiated . Spencer also makes a distinction between these real or primary feelings and the " ideal " feelings , ( i.e. , remembered sensations or emotions or ideas of sensations and emotions ) on the basis of the greater vividness of the former and the relative faintness of the latter . Feelings of relation include those of difference , coexistence , and sequence.41 The feeling of difference is illustrative . This feeling occurs when we pass from one conscious state to another , as when we are aroused from a train of thought on reading this material by the call to supper . The passage from one state to another creates a momentary slight " shock " because of the difference between the temporally adjacent states . Similarly , there are relations of coexistence and of sequence in our continuing conscious experience . Feelings of relation , being a " given " of consciousness , helps to reduce the burden upon the working of association.42 These feelings of relations were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mill , as we have seen , burdened the mind with an impossible number of associations . As we also know , John Stuart Mill and Bain both struggled with this prohleln ,  | not too successfully . By postulating feelings of relation , Spencer helped to get around this difficulty . The affinity of the " relations " to the solutions of the problem which the Wurzburg School suggested is apparent . As to the mechanism of association itself , Spencer stressed similarity , but since associations are built up by experience , he could not dispense with the principle of contiguity entirely ; he , therefore , mentioned , as additional conditions of association , vividness and repetition.43 Aside from his postulation of feelings of relation , Spencer 's position here differs only slightly from the earlier individual versions of associationism . This account , however , is but a pale preliminary to the over-all originality of his discussion of other psychological topics . After a lengthy physiological introduction , Spencer considers the relation of psychology to biology . In the classification of the sciences , psychology appears as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychological processes . Adjustment of interactions to outer conditions is a persistent theme that Spencer stressed.44 The life of every organism is a series of adjustments to the environment . Just as in biology , the environment must always be considered in dealing with psychological phenomena . In fact , the environment must be considered just as much as the " correlated phenomena of the organism . " 45 For example , as they were for Hartley , pleasure and pain are adjustive.46 If animals find poisonous foods enjoyable , they die . " Survival of the fittest , " 47 ( Spencer 's phrase , not Darwin 's ) brings inclinations into harmony with environmental conditions . As might have been gathered from the discussion of feelings of relation , Spencer emphasized the constant flow of consciousness . There had been some conception of a stream of consciousness in Bain , but Spencer developed the idea much more fully . Interruptions in this flow of consciousness were expressed by feelings of relational difference ; coexistence and sequence stressed its continuity . According to Spencer there are two separable aggregates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . He meant that the former has to do with consciousness of what we today would call the present environment , whereas the latter is our thoughts of situations not physically present . States of consciousness arising from the objective world will show cohesion and continuity , provided we are physically passive . To change this state , we must change ourselves . At the seashore it is still the sand , the sea , and the pier of which we are aware , despite our sitting through the sunlight of day to the dusk of night with all the changes of experience that this entails . There is no break in the consciousness throughout . I ; v contrast , subjective states , characteristically less  | vivid , are easily changed . As we sit at the beach , the sight of a book in the hand of a passerby or a sea gull crossing our line of vision may start a new subjective state of consciousness , totally breaking off our reverie , say , about some past triumph . Nevertheless , the objective state of consciousness remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he states that changes of a particular sort do occur . Without change , consciousness is impossible . But this is not simply random change . It is orderly change . There is an organization to these changes.48 Changes would pass as images do across a mirror , unless there was assimilation , the work of intelligence.49 So change ( differentiation ) and assimilation ( integration ) continually take place . Intelligence is this process of assimilation of impressions.JO Spencer emphasized much more what intelligence does than what it is.51 Intelligence is the means of bringing about that adjustment of internal to external relations , 5 " which previously had been called the definition of life . Intelligence establishes this correspondence to the best of its ability , using its feeling of relation and other activities , such as instinct , perception , conception , memory , will , and the like . In fact , only feelings as such are omitted , since they are not a constituent of intelligence but only its raw materials . Intelligence is to be judged by its remoteness from reflex action.53 He specified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplicity , poverty , and rigidity of the latter . When there are limitations of intelligence in an individual , abstract conception becomes impossible . Mind and intelligence are specifically distinguished by Spencer . Intelligence involves the relational aspect of mind , but this in turn demands the presence of the feelings with which they are related . Intellect consists of various degrees of flexibility in form of the relations of the mind.54 Assimilation of a relation to its past kindred is the means of intelligence of operation.55 Intelligence increases progressively throughout the scale of the animal kingdom.56 Within the individual , growth of intelligence is shown in three ways : increase in accuracy with which inner tendencies are proportioned to outer persistences , increase in number of cases of equal difficulty , and increase in complexity of coherent states of consciousness answering to coherent complexities in the environment.5 " This is a definition of intelligence of astonishing complexity and subtlety , considering the relatively primitive state of understanding of the nature and function of intelligence current at the time . We now come to the crucial issue , the means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held that often-repeated associations develop a hereditary tendency so that the offspring are more likely to inherit a tendency that their forebears had learned . ' s This is eliminative effect in  | successive generations . To put it succinctly , there is an inheritance of acquired associations . This supposition that habits acquired by the individual can be transmitted by means of heredity is , of course , dependent upon the reality of the transmission of acquired characters . Later research in genetics has not demonstrated such transmission . Despite this difficulty , the old quarrel between the empiricists and nativists was in some measure resolved by Spencer 's theory . As Boring writes : Finally we must note that evolutionary psychology played into the hands of nativism and against geneticism . It is almost paradoxical that such should have been the case . Locke 's empiricism led to associationism , and the genetic view of perception , for example , was the natural result . In fact , this view was as often called empiristic as genetic . Nativism , the opponent theory , seemed to go back through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very view that Locke brought empiricism to combat . Spencer 's theory was essentially a resolution of the two views , although , because of the failure of science generally to accept the doctrine of the inheritance of acquired characters , his synthesis lacks the importance that it would otherwise have . Spencer simply substituted phylogenetic origin for ontogenetic origin in many cases . What is empiristically derived in the race may nevertheless be native in the individual , he might have said.59 The tabula rosa was banished . The individual , it is true , does not inherit experiences , but does inherit certain organic capacities which make for different experiences for later members of the species . For a variety of reasons given in this and earlier chapters , association as we have followed it through the centuries is no longer the same doctrine . This is signalized by the use hereafter of different conceptual terms ? historically derived from associationism , to be sure , but deserving of a new terminology to accompany the new outlook . There remains only Spencer 's interpretation of **27;387;TOOLONG . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant and the beneficial and the unpleasant and harmful , as noted earlier . That which is pleasant , the organism maintains , and this association is inherited ; on the other hand , that which is painful is abandoned . Spencer was saying that there was a selection of pleasant acts which are useful , and abandonment of unpleasant acts which are harmful . A version of what came later to be called the law of effect was being advocated by him . That rewards and punishments are instigators of behavior was , in later generations , to become a central theme of psychology . Other **25;416;TOOLONG than Spencer were profoundly influenced Iw evoliit ini iary thinking . Onc of these was James Ward ( 1843-1925 ) who wrote the account of psychology for the ninth edition ( 1885 ) of the Encyclopaedia  | Britannica and later revised it for the eleventh edition.60 He is chiefly remembered today for this article which had a remarkable influence on succeeding generations of British psychologists . His was a combination of phenomenology and evolutionary doctrine . In a manner akin to Brentano he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind was active in its judging and perceiving . Mental processes rather than being Wundtian building blocks , evolved from an undifferentiated state in the direction of greater and greater differentiation . Mental elements , instead of existing from time immemorial , went through a process of emerging from out of more undifferentiated mental states . There was not combination and recombination of elementary units ; instead , there was growth and differentiation where none was before . MORGAN AND COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY In the early nineteenth century , there had been some interest in animal behavior . The concern centered primarily on the question of instinct as contrasted with reason . Meanwhile , biologists and physiologists were becoming interested in the sense organs and the motor activities of various kinds of animals . With the advent of Darwinism , research with animals accelerated rapidly . It took as its major problem the relation of forms of behavior to the phylogenetic scale of animals , particularly as expressed in the similarity and difference between man and the lower animals . In the earliest phase , and still for some time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . G. S. Romanes61 saw his task as involving observed behavior , right enough , but to do so in order to draw inference about the animals subjective status . This he did on the theoretical premise that the degree of differences between man and animal depended upon the degree of evolutionary separation between them . He concluded from the evidence he collected that in varying degrees animals do possess the mental characteristics of man . In its earliest phase the question at issue was still seen as the contrast between instinct and reason . Naturally on the side of diminishing the gulf between man and animal , evolutionists stressed finding evidence of " reason " in animals . Their major tool at first was to collect anecdotes about animals , that is to say , the accounts of casual observations of remarkable feats of animals upon which they chanced or had ferreted out by questioning farmers , animal breeders , zoo keepers , and their like . Most often the anecdotes unearthed involved behavior on the part of some animal which seemed to show that the particular behavior involved doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinct , such as a dog 's lifting a gate latch without known previous training . Would not this seem to be because the dog had reasoned that he could get out , if he did what he had seen his master do , and accordingly did so ? This particular instance of the dog and the opening of the latch serves admirably to introduce one of the first crude but effective experiments which C. Lloyd Morgan , ( 1852 ? 1936 ) reported.62 Morgan considered precisely this behavior of a dog lifting a latch . He agreed that it was not due to instinct but asked could not this behavior be explained otherwise than by assuming that the dog had reasoned out a relation of the means employed to the end obtained . Morgan answered that there could be ; he had been fortunate enough to have observed what had happened in his own dog in precisely this instance . He agreed that the person observing the behavior after the process was fixed could not be blamed for assuming that it was reasoning which brought about the solution . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed the necessary toss of the catch and , then , immediately bolted off down the road seemed to indicate reasoning . What had actually happened ? Before the dog could lift the latch with his muzzle Morgan had observed that he would run up and down , sticking his head through the vertical bars at various points , sometimes near the catch , sometimes farther away . He wanted to get out , and in his excitement behaved restlessly . To quote Morgan from this point on : At length it so happened that he put out his head beneath the latch , which , as I have said , is at a convenient height for his doing so , being about a foot above the level of the wall . The latch was thus lifted . He withdrew his head and began to look elsewhere , when he noticed that the gate was swinging open , and out he bolted . After that , whenever I took him out , instead of opening the gate for him , I waited until he lifted the latch . Gradually he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong place , to the one opening from which the latch could be lifted . But it was nearly three weeks , during which I took him out about a dozen times , before he went at once and without hesitation to the right place and put because there was so little connection between gazing out into the road and getting out into the road . He did not , at first at any rate , seem to do the former in order to effect the latter . The relation between means and end did not appear to take form in his mind , even subconsciously as means to the end . And I take it that he never had the faintest notion of how or why looking out just there came to mean walking forth into the road.63 In addition to such findings , Morgan carried comparative psychology farther Iw criticizing vigorously the anecdotal work that went on before him , and he supplied won rigorously interpreted instances of observations than his  | predecessors . As it means of increasing rigor , he formulated a famous interpretive dictum as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of parsimony , first encountered centuries before . His phrasing , which has come to be called Lloyd Morgan 's canon , was that in no case should animal activity be interpreted in terms of higher psychological processes , if it is interpretable in terms of processes standing lower in the scale of psychological evolution . The work of Morgan was representative of that of a small but increasing number of persons who were founding the field of comparative psychology . In fact , research studies had been performed even before those of Morgan . Spalding65 had been among the first . He took young swallows from the moment of hatching , confined them in cages away from other birds , and released them at an age when normally they would be able to fly . He found that they soon " learned " to fly , despite never having observed the flight of other birds . In the United States , simultaneously with Morgan , E. L. Thorndike was carrying on his studies with the added controls of laboratory equipment . His pioneer studies on learning in cats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1898.66 However , major discussion is reserved for later . ( See page 414 . ) LATER DEVELOPMENTS Accounts of mental development by psychologists , largely due to the pioneering work of Darwin and Galton , began to appear in increasing numbers at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries , particularly in England and the United States . More specifically , studies of mental development in the race and in the individual , studies in child psychology , and studies in animal psychology increased in number and quality . The evolutionary biological influence upon psychology served as a corrective to the earlier almost exclusively cognitive psychology , but it did not change psychology overnight . Evolutionary thinking modified many psychological foci of interest in the direction of placing many of the old problems of sensationperception and association in different perspectives . It introduced more functional issues , such as those of intelligence as a process and of adaptation to the environment . The old problem of instinct versus reason was now banished , and the new question of the relative influence of instinct and learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predominately introspective , with mind still the central problem until the twentieth century was well tinder way . Emphasis upon adaptability of man to his environment and , indeed , upon behavior as such , as one of the considerations for psychology will he seen  | as important sources of inspiration for the functional and behavioristic approaches of the twentieth century .

THORNDIKE , Animal Intelligence : an Experimental Study of the Associative Processes in Animals , Psychol . Rev. Mon . Suppl. , 1898 , 2 , No. 4.  | ROM the beginning of the nineteenth century , France had a tradition that centered on psychopathological problems . Pierre Janet , one of their leading psychologists toward the end of the century , was to attest to the fact that what was most characteristic of France was the development of " pathological " psychology . ) Even when they had their degrees in philosophy or in one of the sciences , psychologists still were apt to be influenced by this tradition . There seemed to be two distinguishable groups of psychologists in France at the time ? the physician-psychologist interested in abnormal mental phenomena and in their treatment and the academic-medical psychologist who paid some attention to the more conventional aspect of psychology , including its teaching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomena which interested his medical confreres . Charcot and Bernheim are representative of the former group , whereas Ribot and Janet are representative of the latter . Binet , as befits the greatest French psychologist of his time , shared in this tradition but also created one of his own . Just before the beginning of the nineteenth century , France became the first country to begin to develop adequate care for the insane and the feebleminded . One of its leading physicians at the turn of the century was Philippe Pinel ( 1745-1826 ) .2 In 1792 , he had been appointed superintendent of the  | asylum at Bicetre . In the wake of the Revolution came his own particular application of the " Rights of Man " to the miserable patients in his charge who had been kept in chains and treated as wild beasts , even to the point of being on exhibit to those who paid a small fee . After a personal plea before the Revolutionary Convention , Pinel was permitted to dispense with the chains . He treated his patients humanely and placed them under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental diseases was a potent plea for more humanitarian treatment of the insane . Instead of accepting the then current view of their being wicked people in the grip of demoniacal possession , Pinel was convinced that brain dysfunction may be related to severe psychological disorders . True , he knew too little to advance very far , but the conviction was there . Pinel was succeeded in his work by Jean Etienne Esquirol ( 1772-1840 ) , who worked assiduously at establishing properly run asylums . He also wrote a monumental work on mental diseases , one more rational and descriptive than the barren speculations of most of his predecessors.4 Jean Itard ( 1775-1838 ) , a contemporary of Pinel and Esquirol , was the pioneer in the systematic study of mental deficiency.5 A teacher of the deaf , he was consulted about the " wild boy of Aveyron " in 1798 . The year before in a woods in the Department of Aveyron , a so-called wild boy had been found by hunters . He was brought to Itard to see if he could be trained to live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prevalence of theories of the " noble savage . " Itard worked long and arduously but could not in any way restore the child to normality . The boy through much effort learned a few habits more in keeping with his new environment , but was still unable to take care of himself . Finally it dawned on Itard that the boy was an idiot or an imbecile . He abandoned further work with the child as hopeless since he shared in the common belief that idiots or imbeciles were but brutes incapable of any sort of training . However , his assistant , Edouard Seguin ( 1812-1880 ) , continued to work with the boy after Itard had given up because he appreciated that the gains made , slight though they were , made the child both happier and better adjusted to society . Afterward , Seguin devoted his career to attempts to train feebleminded children and eventually was put in charge of a school for the feebleminded . This was the first institution of its kind and marks the beginning of training schools for the mentally retarded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interest in hypnotic phenomena . The history of phenomena of what came to be called hypnotism is at least as old as temple medicine in ancient Greece . Its modern phase begins with the work of Franz Anton Mesmer ( 1734-1815 ) .6 After attracting considerable notoriety in Vienna through use of his so-called animal magnetism , in treating all sorts of patients he was ordered to leave the city .  | He settled in Paris during the 1780 's , where his remarkable cures , especially of what we would now call hysterical patients , made him well known . He thought of animal magnetism as an invisible fluid whose magnetic power he communicated through his hands by making passes over the bodies of his patients , after which he gave them assurances of their cure from the ailment from which they suffered . Physicians called Mesmer an imposter , and the first of several commissions was appointed by the French government to investigate his powers . It included among its members , Benjamin Franklin . The general conclusions of this and later commissions was that Mesmer effected many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was actually due to some as yet unknown physiological cause . Whatever else may have been taking place , magnetism as known in physics had nothing to do with these phenomena . The reports , generally unfavorable , were widely disseminated . As a consequence of this unfavorable publicity , Mesmer lost his practice and returned to private life . For some time after the French Revolution , mesmerism , as it was by then called , led a checkered career , kept alive by a few who used it with little or no understanding of what they were doing . Meanwhile , it was derided as quackery by most physicians . It was James Braid ( c.1795-1860 ) in England , who named the phenomena , " hypnotism. " 7 He considered that in hypnotism some sort of change took place in the nervous system as the result of psychological instigation . Braid8 described hypnotism as induced sleep and considered hypnosis nothing more than a convenient and quick means of throwing the nervous system into a state useful for the treatment of certain disorders . He showed that hypnotism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object , a procedure which helped to remove it from the realm of the uncanny . His lack of exaggeration , his caution , and his modest admission of lack of understanding impressed other medical men . The fact that he first expressed his interest in the topic by publicly attacking the mesmerists probably served to provide him with a respectability that the earlier workers lacked . His work became known in France in the middle of the nineteenth century through a Dr. Azam , a surgeon of Bordeaux . Azam saw its advantage in surgical operations and proceeded to use it in this way . He was followed by others . However , hypnosis came into national prominence only with the work of Charcot. // Jean-Martin Charcot ( 1825-1893 ) , a physician , was appointed Professor of ' Pathological Anatomy at the University of Paris in 1860 . Two years later ,  | he was appointed a senior physician to the Salpetriere , a hospital for mental disorders , where he established a neurological clinic . He is often referred to as the father of neurology because of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his patients to the normal and morbid anatomy of the nervous system , a correlation which is precisely the basis of neurology today . He carried on important studies of such diseases as multiple sclerosis and spinal paralysis and worked with problems of the localization of lesions in the brain and spinal cord . He was also famous as a teacher , for he was skilled in communicating his knowledge of diagnosis and of anatomy to his pupils through case conferences . His fame was international , and students came to him from all over Europe . In 1885-1886 Sigmund Freud worked under Charcot , learning enough from him to refer to him later as " my master . " w ( See page 463 . ) Charcot was already a well-established teacher and research man when he acquired his interest in hypnosis . Charles Richet ( 1850-1935 ) in 1875 had judged the phenomena of hypnosis to be undoubtedly genuine . Accepting this statement of a respected colleague , Charcot launched into a period of intense clinical investigation and made his case conferences famous by demonstrating the many phenomena which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his attention on patients showing symptoms of hysteria . What are some of the symptoms of hysteria ? Somnambulism ( sleep walking ) , fugues ( running away without awareness of so doing ) , multiple personalities , convulsive attacks are all included whenever organic causes can be ruled out , as are also contractures , paralyses , vomiting , deafness , blindness , loss of speech , and anaesthesia ( loss of sensitivity ) of parts of the body.il To add to the complexity the symptoms change even from day to day , for one day a patient may complain of vomiting , and the next day of headache . Mesmer and the other mesmerists must have treated a large number of individuals who later would have been in this category . Moreover , hysteria is the great simulator of other diseases , such as tumors , intestinal obstructions , lesions of the bones and muscles , as well as organically based blindness and deafness . Charcot soon compared the phenomena of hypnosis to artificial hysteria . The patients of Salpetriere , whom he found to be amenable to hypnosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those already diagnosed as hysterics . Moreover , he soon discovered that the symptoms of the hysteric patient could be modified by hypnosis ; thus hypnosis came to be the preferred method of treatment for this category of patients . He thus moved against established medical opinion which still regarded hypnosis as somewhere between a theatrical stunt and sheer charlatanism . At Salpetriere under ( ? harcot 's leadership it was believed that the hypnotic  | phenomena arose from hysteria in that only a person with an hysterical make-up could be brought to hypnotic sleep . Based on studying various degrees of the depth of hypnosis , Charcot 12 asserted the existence of three main progressive stages in the depth of hypnosis : lethargy ( drowsiness ) , catalepsy ( isolated suggestions can be accepted and acted upon , since there is no interference by other ideas ) , and somnambulism ( ability to carry out complicated activities with no recollection afterward ) . His interest in producing deep hypnosis arose from his desire to be absolutely certain of being able to distinguish between true hysteria and simulation of these conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Charcot was satisfied only with placing his patients under deep hypnosis in order to be sure that faking was eliminated . Meanwhile another approach to hypnosis was being developed in Nancy by Liebeault and Bernheim. // A country doctor , Ambroise-Auguste Liebeault ( 1823-1904 ) had been using hypnosis in his practice without fee with all peasants who would agree to its use , whereas for other forms of treatment they had to pay . Peasants knowing a bargain when they see one , flocked to him . It was not until he happened to treat a former patient of the neurologist , Hyppolyte Bernheim ( 1840-1919 ) , that his work received the attention that would place it ultimately in the history of psychology and medicine . This patient , who suffered from sciatica , had not responded to Bernheim 's treatment , but he did to Liebeault 's hypnosis . The already well-known Bernheim was impressed and became a pupil of Liebeault in 1882 . He was destined , it is said , 14 to hypnotize 10,000 persons during his remaining years of clinical activities . Together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was presently to rival Paris as one of the two centers in France for work in hypnotism . These workers , seeing no essential difference between spontaneous and induced sleep , 15 used the suggestion of sleep as the basis for the production of hypnosis . Essentially , the method of treatment of the Nancy school was based upon suggestion . To them , suggestion meant that under hypnosis new attitudes and beliefs were accepted by the patient uncritically , and he would then behave in accordance with these new ideas . During hypnosis , these two doctors would tell their patients , they would feel well or their symptoms would disappear . In a fair number of instances , the effect was not , as might have been expected , merely temporary but appeared to he permanent . The clinics of Nancy and Paris were ideological rivals . At Nancy it was  | taught that hypnosis , at least in the mild form which it was customarily used there , could be induced in nearly all subjects and that it was essentially a passive-receptive state brought about by suggestion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathological state of the organism . At Nancy they challenged the identification of hypnosis with hysteria , arguing that the very stages that Charcot found were the result of specific suggestions . Later events have tended ' to support Bernheim and Liebeault rather than Charcot . Workers at Nancy and at Salpetriere , far apart as they might have thought themselves at the time , were both laboring with similar groups of patients ? the neurotics . No longer was interest in abnormal mental phenomena to be confined to wards of the mental hospitals . These men had isolated the neuroses from other mental diseases and in doing so had discovered them . THEODULE RIBOT Theodule Ribot ( 1839-1916 ) had perhaps the greatest breadth of interests and certainly was the most well read of the French psychologists of his time . He served as the psychological educator of his countrymen . In 187016 and 187917 he published books which interpreted English associationism and German experimentalism to his countrymen . In general , French psychologists tended to be skeptical about the value of the German experimental psychology and to make only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French tradition , Ribot also systematically explored what was known about the pathological aspects of affective life , and he wrote books about the diseases of the will , memory , and personality , regarding these abnormalities as products of faulty brain functioning . In discussing diseases of personality and in his presentation of cases , Ribot stressed dissociation , the splitting of the bonds of consciousness . He also reintroduced evolutionary thinking into French psychology . In 1875 he founded and edited the Revue Philosophique , which was to publish a fair amount of psychological material . Ribot was appointed Professor of Experimental Psychology in 1889 at the College of France . He was not , however , an experimental psychologist in the sense of having a laboratory . In his strategic position he was to have as students many of the next generation of the academically oriented French psychologists . // Pierre Janet ( 1859-1947 ) studied philosophy and psychology in the Faculty of Letters and then went on to the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Paris . Before completing his medical training , he accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Paris . At this time he was only twenty-two years of age . Eager to advance his career , he became interested in a patient named Leonie , already known to the medical profession for exhibiting both hypnotic and clairvoyant phenomena . After making a careful study of this intriguing combination , he reported that it seemed possible that she could be hypnotized from a distance . Through this case study Janet came into contact with Charcot . Shortly afterward Janet returned to Paris to study again in both the Faculties of Letters and Medicine , and in 1889 he received his doctorate in letters with a thesis on psychology of automatic activities.19 The following year he was invited by Charcot to become director of the psychological laboratory of Salpetriere , where he tried to bring some order and system into the classification of hysteria and tried to relate these , in turn , to the conceptions of academic psychology . This study20 became his thesis for his doctorate in medicine , a degree he received in 1892 . After teaching at the Sorbonne from 1895 to 1902 , Janet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he held until his retirement . He visited the United States in 1906 to lecture at Harvard University Medical School . The lectures were published in English as The Major Symptoms of Hysteria , 21 the book for which he is best known in the United States . During all these years , in addition to carrying out his academic duties , he was also a busy practicing physician , specializing in mental diseases . He died in 1947 . Janet himself clearly differentiated his work from that carried on at Salpetriere . The work under Charcot was primarily neurological so that paralyses , contractures , and disturbances of the senses were emphasized . Janet , on the contrary , saw hysteria as a mental disease , consisting chiefly in an exaggeration of suggestibility ; and , therefore , he emphasized mental phenomena ? particularly impairments of memory and the presence of fixed ideas . This appeal to fixed ideas was based on the fact that , somehow , these patients fastened onto the idea that they were paralysed or had lost sensitivity . These symptoms were not readily resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ideas . Thus Janet was closer to Bernheim in his interpretation than to Charcot , for both Janet and Bernheim saw many of the phenomena of hypnosis and of hysteria as products of suggestion . This resemblance becomes evident when one stops to consider that the behavioral phenomena are similar ; for the only difference seems to be that under hypnosis , since we know how the behavioral phenomena were instilled , we know their origin , whereas in hysteria we do not . Psychic energy and its diminution or depletion was a guiding concept of Janet.22 Feelings of pressure experienced by the patient and cousey tent feelings  | of effort served to indicate this diminution of functioning quite apart from behaviors considered as symptomatic of this energy . Janet held that we do not know the nature of the energy , but we can study its manifestations . Individuals differ in quantity of energy available to them from both hereditary and environmental origins.23 The environmental sources which Janet cited as responsible for lessened energy included fatigue , malnutrition , disease , pernicious experience , and inadequate education . Neuroses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inability to mobilize enough energy to meet the exigencies of life . There was a weakness in these patients . Illustrative of how weakness came to be postulated is the frequent triviality of the precipitating situation . At the age of twenty a man found himself near a heavy object as it fell from a window , breaking glass with the sound like that of a gun shot . The man became dumb for two months , and twenty-six years later the slightest unexpected noise would still strike him dumb for several months at a time.24 An even more famous case was observed in Boston , 25 where a young lady , upon being kissed unexpectedly , developed symptoms which kept Morton Prince , an American psychologist , busy for years . Personality to Janet was a matter of integration . Within the normal individual , this integration of tendencies and ideas is relatively stable ; in the hysterical individual this unity is lacking , and , in extreme cases , a lack of integration may extend to the point of splitting of the personality into alternating personalities , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases a failure of conscious control had taken place . There is , said Janet , a narrowing of the field of consciousness open to the individual . In the contraction of consciousness , the hysterical symptoms are carried on without the individual being consciously aware of them . A rhythmic movement of the arm evokes in the patient no sense that he is doing it ; he looks at it as something alien . The arm is carrying out the movement without his volition . The paralyzed leg is an alien " stump , " as some of his patients called it , attached to the body , but not part of the person . If double personalities develop , the primary personality may not be aware of the thoughts , feelings , and experiences of the secondary personality . When a fugue occurs , a person may travel , eat in restaurants , answer questions , and generally behave in a fashion that attracts no attention , yet he will , on " awakening , " not know where he is , how he got there , or what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even months , during which he lived in the fugue state . Janet considered that the dissociative split of consciousness came about because of some mental or physical shock . Often he found that the history of the patient showed either a long maintained or a continued series of conflicts . I.isscntially , then , li5stcria is a contraction of consciousness clue to exhaustion  | of the higher functions.26 Over all , the dynamic factor is conversion symbolism , the " driving back " of that which is unacceptable in consciousness . The patient tries to get rid of thoughts which are painful or in opposition to moral feelings ; he struggles to drive them out of consciousness . When he succeeds in making these experiences unconscious , his symptoms develop with the contraction of consciousness . As a result of clinical investigation , Janet came close to a conception of unconsciousness as a dynamic process . He had spoken of " automatic " activities as early as 1889 in his doctoral thesis and had discussed the " unconscious , " but impartial critics see in his usage hardly more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Janet found that under hypnosis these " forgotten , " experiences can often be recalled to the patient and that the symptoms , the origin of which was unknown , could be traced back to their source and , after hypnotic suggestions , would even disappear ( although other symptoms might turn up to take their place ) . As might be anticipated , these views created a strained relationship with Sigmund Freud , whose formulations in a similar fashion are discussed later . ( See Chapter 20 . ) Freud saw Janet as working in a similar area but at a superficial level . In turn , Janet claimed that psychoanalysis originated from his and Charcot 's work.27 Moreover , as an eclectic in psychotherapy he considered psychoanalysis to be one among many forms of treatment . Specifically , it served to bring about dissociation of traumatic memories . ALFRED BINET In the early fall of 1904 , the Minister of Public Instruction appointed a committee to recommend what should be done about the education of subnormal children in the schools of Paris .

It was to this task , a call which he himself had invited , that Alfred Binet , then a man of forty-seven , turned his talents and experience by constructing the first intelligence scale.2s To appreciate properly the nature of his contribution , it is necessary to say something about the years of preparation for the task and the status of psychological testing at that time . Life of Binet 29 Alfred Binet was born in Nice in 1857 . He was educated at Paris in law , a subject in which he received his degree in 1878 ; but his interests in the sciences and in medicine came to the fore , and he abandoned the law to I ) lunge into their study . While still a law student , he had been attracted to the  | Salpetriere where Charcot was the center of attention , and Binet 's predilection for psychological problems became evident to him , particularly in respect to that burning question of the day , hypnotism . Binet took a degree in the natural sciences in 1890 and a doctorate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of insects . While still working on his degree , Binet had written a book on hypnosis with Fere , 30 giving a detailed account of its history . This book appeared in 1886 . He had studied hypnosis using such devices as the dynamometer to measure strength of grip and the pneumograph for the recording of breathing rate . A few experiments were reported ; these measures were taken in the normal and in the hypnotic state and under the effect of various suggestions and compared . Another book31 by Binet , also appearing in 1886 , was concerned with reasoning . The volume was prophetic of his life-long interest in higher mental processes . However , in its writing , he depended for his sources on a general theory of association , upon some incidental findings with hypnosis , and upon his knowledge of logic , rather than upon research data . Meanwhile , events were making him a psychologist , perhaps partly because of these books . Beaunais , professor of physiology on the Faculty of Medicine at Nancy , became the first director of the psychological laboratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Sorbonne , the laboratory was administratively not part of the Faculty of Letters but of the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes . Ribot , who had previously been in charge of the course in experimental psychology but without a laboratory , moved from the Sorbonne the same year to the chair of experimental and comparative psychology at the College of France . Binet , who was associated with Beaunais during these years , was asked in 1892 to be adjunct director . On the retirement of Beaunais in 1894 because of ill health , Binet became director of the laboratory , a post he held to his death in 1911 at the age of fifty-four . Some of Binet 's early work stressed the abnormal , since he wrote a book on The Alterations of the Personality33 in 1892 and one on Suggestibility34 in 1900 . In the same period , he carried on studies in tactile sensibility and optical illusions in a fashion similar to that of his German contemporaries . Then , or later , he studied handwriting , using blind analysis to increase his objectivity ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried on a series of studies of suggestion . Within the tradition of medical psychology , it was these studies of suggestibility for which Binet was best known . In collaboration with Beaunais and with Victor Henri as his assistant , he had established in 1895 what was to become the leading French psychological journal , / , 1tinc / ) si/chologique . About I900 Iiinet began to study thinking by the use of introspection . His previous hook on n ; iuniing had been written without the hindrance of research  | data . Now in his new work , published in 1902,35 he depended for data upon the reports of the thinking of his two daughters , then of high school age . As was the case in his studies of intelligence later , he failed to be impressed by the necessity of working with minute elements of psychic life and believed that psychological problems of thinking may be attacked globally . ( In fact , it was only in keeping with contemporary usage that this may be called a study of thinking . Actually , Binet referred to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked his daughters to solve problems and then to report to him the steps they took to reach a solution . Often the girls specifically denied the presence of images . In general , these results anticipated and supported the research of the Wurzburg School . Like those at Wiirzburg , Binet found much thinking that could not be reduced to sensory or ideational elements . Although the girls were similar in their thinking in regards to matters so far described , it also happened that the two girls differed strikingly in their particular ways of thinking and in their personality , differences to which their father 's account devotes considerable attention . Undoubtedly , this study had something to do with strengthening Binet 's interest in individual differences . Aside from a somewhat greater interest in laboratory research than was characteristic of his fellow Frenchmen and the writing of a textbook of experimental psychology , 36 Binet 's career with its interest in abnormal phenomena was quite in keeping with the tradition of psychology in his country . However , busy as all this work kept him , his claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nature of intelligence . Measurement of Intelligence In 1905 Binet37 urged that it was necessary to establish an accurate diagnosis of intelligence if the recommendation of the committee concerning placement of feebleminded children in special schools was to be carried out adequately . He was sharply critical of medical diagnosis of this condition . Previously , diagnosis of mental deficiency was considered as analogous to diagnosis of physical disease . It is not surprising that errors occurred , since no one invariable sign of mental deficiency was known , then or later . For this purpose , Binet drew attention in copious detail to the errors that physicians had made iii diagnosis by showing how the same child could carry different diagnoses as he was evaluated by different physicians , even just a few days apart . It was thus that the work of the Parisian committee precipitated the development of the Binet Scale and centered Binet 's interest upon the problem of the diagnosis of the feebleminded . It did not create his interest in the problem of intelligence .  | For many years before the establishment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in the measurement of intelligence and individual differences . Ever since about 1887 , his principle source of subjects for study had been the school children in and around Paris upon whom he had tried out various tests.38 With his long-time collaborator and assistant , Victor Henri , Binet published seven papers on individual differences . The crucial paper on tests appeared in 1896.39 First Binet and Henri reviewed the literature which was already quite extensive . Without confining discussion to the specific tests they reviewed , it will suffice to say that presumably they were familiar with the work of Galton and perhaps also with the contribution of Ebbinghaus on the completion test to be published in 1897 . There was also available to them a considerable literature on elementary sensory , perceptual , and motor measures . Narrow phases of mental activity , such as sensory acuity , reaction time , attention span , speed of movement , and the like had been studied during preceding years . Binet and Henri pointed out that too-limited and too-specialized abilities were being utilized for a measurement of so complex a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the relation of memory to intelligence was to be studied , it would be necessary to examine various kinds of memory , rather than to be content with studying one kind alone . Several variations of memory must be tapped . Binet and Henri proposed that visual memory of a geometrical design , memory of a sentence , memory of musical notes , memory of color , and memory of digits should all be included as tests of intelligence . Recognition of the differences in endowments among individuals indicated the need for tests covering a wide scope . They urged for this purpose tests , not of elementary functions but of the higher mental processes . Among the ten mental processes they proposed , to study were ( 1 ) memory , as already noted ; ( 2 ) images , measured by recalling twelve randomly selected letters exposed to view long enough for two readings at a " natural " rate ; and ( 3 ) attention , divided into duration ( reproduction of the length of a line of a given length shown only once ) and scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two metronomes set for slightly different speeds with gradual increase of the speeds on successive trials until the subject 's limit is reached ) . The other tests were for measurements of imagination , comprehension , suggestibility , esthetic appreciation , moral sentiments , strength of will , and motor skill . During the years between 1897 and 1905 Binet and his collaborators had I rnisicd thetnselves with developing new tests , particularly for the higher mental processes . Theodore Simon , a new collaborator , also collected anthropometric measurements .  | In 1905 the first intelligence scale appeared as the joint effort of Binet and Simon.40 It consisted of a long series of tests they had given to what was for this time , a rather large sample of children . Their guiding concept in its construction was that of a scale ? a series of tests of increasing difficulty starting with the lowest intellectual level and extending to that of the average level . The scale was avowedly a test to be applied rather than just a means of research , for they encouraged others to use their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testers to secure training from them , stressed the need for uniformity of administration , and warned against permitting coaching of the children tested . In 1908 they revised and improved the scale.41 The tests were arranged , not merely by level of difficulty but according to the age from three to twelve at which presumably normal children could pass them successfully . If on the tryout of a test , being evaluated for possible inclusion , it was found that all or nearly all of the children six years old failed , the item was obviously too hard for that age ; whereas if practically all eight-year-olds passed it , it was too easy . The only possibility remaining would be to place it at the seven-year level . This particular test would then have been placed at the seven-year level provided it met the general criterion for placement of a test . The rule was that if 60 to 90 per cent of the children at a given age passed a particular test , it was to be considered standard for that age and included in the scale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , it came about that children of all levels of intelligence were brought into the focus of attention , and the feebleminded were left merely as a deviant from the normal . A shift away from the relatively specific problem of the detection of feeblemindedness to the more general problem of the measurement of intelligence at all levels had taken place . Tabulated below are the tests at both ends of the scale grouped according to the age at which the " majority " of children succeeded on them : Age 3 Years 1 . Points to nose , eyes , mouth . 2 . Repeats sentences of six syllables. 3 . Repeats two digits . 4 . Enumerates objects in a picture . 5 . Gives family name . Age 4 Years 1 . Knows sex . 2 . Names certain familiar objects shown to him ; keel , porky tkni/r , and a petal ! / .  | 3 . Repeats three digits . 4 . Indicates which is the longer of two lines five and six cm. in length . Age 11 Years 1 . Points out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in test 3 for age 10 years . Hardly one fourth pass the test at 10 years , while all do at 11 years of age . 3 . Names sixty words in three minutes . 4 . Defines abstract terms ? charity , justice , kindness . 5 . Puts words , arranged in a random order , into a sentence . Age 12 Years 1 . Repeats seven digits . 2 . Finds in one minute three rimes for a given word ? obedience . 3 . Repeats a sentence of twenty-six syllables. 4 . Answers problem questions ? a common-sense test . 5 . Gives interpretation of pictures . Age 13 Years 1 . Draws the design that would be made by cutting a triangular piece from the once-folded edge of a quarto-folded paper . 2 . Rearranges in imagination the relationship of two triangles and draws the results as they would appear . 3 . Give differences between pairs of abstract terms , as pride and pretension.42 By means of the 1908 scale one could find the mental age of the child , irrespective of his actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , but not those of twelve years , he had a mental age of eleven years . However , very few children were so obliging as to pass all tests at one level and fail all of them at the next , so inherent difficulties of scoring existed which were not cleared up until the next and last revision . Binet and Simon applied the scale to feebleminded children and on the basis of their results , they set limits for three degrees of feeblemindedness as follows : idiot , two years mental age or below ; imbeciles , between two and seven years ; and morons , above seven years . They recognized that the classification lacked prognostic value , since they were dealing with absolute limnits.43 That is to say , their definitions did not take into account the actual or chronological age of the child . Hence , as the child with the passage of years could continue to grow mentally ( although more slowly than the average child ) , he might pass from an idiot to an imbecile to a moron . Souu+tinx ? later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ,  | a German psychologist , who suggested as a solution of this problem the use of an Intelligence Quotient or I.Q. , to be found by dividing a subject 's mental age ( M.A. ) by his actual or chronological age ( C.A. ) . Since the resulting I.Q. is a ratio , it did away with the difficulty of M.A. 's as an absolute measure being used to define degrees of intelligence , including feeblemindedness . Using the LQ. , a child C.A. four with a M.A. of two would have an I.Q. of 50 ( 2/4 ) as would a child eight with a mental age of four ( 4/8 ) . ( The use of a decimal result is eliminated by multiplying by 100 . ) The I.Q. was adopted by Terman in the United States in his 1916 Stanford Revision of the Binet Scales for which he provided a classification of degrees of intelligence in terms of I.Q. , not M.A. Mental age as an absolute measure was still useful ; it was supplemented by the I.Q. , which placed the individual 's intelligence relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States in utilizing the 1908 version of the Binet-Simon Scale.45 However , one early significant study in Belgium was performed by Decroly and Degand.46 They tested a group of boys and girls in a private school in Brussels , to find that , on the average , their subjects were one and a half years in advance of the expected standards or norms published by Binet . After a certain amount of understandable confusion , it was realized that what had been found was the effect of superior social class , since the Belgian children were the sons and daughters of professional men , while Binet 's Parisian children on which the norms were based , were from poorer sections of the city . This finding opened up the whole problem of the relation of intelligence to social class . In 1911 , the year of Binet 's death , the last of his revisions appeared.47 He had profited from the research done with the test , restandardized the placement of tests , added some new tests , and discarded others , particularly because they were too dependent upon school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoring the 1908 revision by making each test at each year worth a certain fraction of a year of mental age , expressed as months of mental age , so that all the tests passed , irrespective of the years at which they were placed , could be added together to get the mental age . Binet had not attempted to analyse intelligence into parts and then devise tests based upon this analysis , but , rather , he used the combined efforts of a series of promising complex tasks selected as generally relevant to intelligence . Naturally , he had devoted some thought to the nature of intelligence . Throughout the years he offered , withdrew , and amended a whole series of definitions . We have already seen that he considered intelligence to be related to judgment . Probably the most characteristic definition and certainly ( 1w definition most commonly associated with his name is that intelligence is a  | combination of capacities to make adaptations to attain a desired end , to maintain a mental set , and to be self-critical.48 Evaluation Speaking generally , Binet advanced objective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his or similar instruments , demonstrated the superiority of objective measurement over clinical diagnosis carried on without such an instrument . The Binet Scales and the later instruments derived from them were quickly demonstrated to be of practical value in educational , social , and medical settings . He also contributed to the more theoretical aspects of psychology by developing a concept of intelligence as a combination of cognitive abilities , and , in the process of doing so , he distinguished intelligence from the specific sensory and motor abilities with which it had earlier been confused by Galton and others . One criterion of the greatness of a psychologist is the fruitfulness of his contribution in leading to other research . In this regard Binet stands very high . Probably more psychological research studies have been stimulated by his work than by that of any other psychologist . OVERVIEW The French psychopathologists saw their patients as people ? sick individuals in need of care . They saw them as individuals and were interested in them as people as well as what they could learn about them . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , was in the process of being supplemented by an interest in the welfare of the individual . Janet49 made this explicit in a paper describing his way of investigating the individual 's unique characteristics . Binet worked in a similar spirit . He saw children as individuals , extending from his own daughters to those tested for the sake of establishing the norms of his scale . After all , an intelligence test-score is that of an individual and represents something about a person . Binet and his associates were applying a clinical method by studying their patients not only so as to understand them but also in order to help them . The French psychologists of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries advanced the understanding of the clinical method in psychology to a point where Freud and the others could carry through the next stage .  | REFERENCES I.

Boring , February 5 , 1962 , through the kindness of the latter . There has been some confusion about who had priority in founding the first laboratory in France . Presumably this is attributable to the fact that three independent institutions of higher education all were involved in the events of 1889 . Ribot moved to the College of France from the Sorbonne , or the College of Letters of the University of Paris . The same year a laboratory was placed in the Sorbonne under the direction of Beaunais in association with Binet , although it was administered by L'Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes , still a third educational Institution . 33 .

JANET , L'analyse psychologique.  | IN THE United States before the 1880 's there were two major psychological traditions ? phrenology and Scottish psychology ) Despite its errors , phrenology in its way was objective in that it depended upon measurements . Moreover , it had a practical aim in view . It flourished outside the schools as illustrated by its previously mentioned appeal to medical men ( see page 245 ) , while business men and reformers of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest of the latter seems incongruous , it should be remembered that phrenology was a doctrine upholding the changeability of human nature . Hence , phrenology was a minor theme in various activities directed toward other ends : temperance , anti-tobacco and birth control ? to name three where the element of control of human nature is self-evident . The works of Gall and Spurzheim were popular in America where they inspired the numerous publications of the Fowler Brothers.2 Scottish psychology had been the heir to the associationistic tradition . It was primarily introspective and still a non-experimental branch of philosophy . just as was the case with its Scottish forebears , in the United States it was used as a defense of revealed religion . James McCosh , President of Princeton University , 1870 to 1892 , and Noah Porter , President of Yale University , were two of its most prominent exponents . This combination of teaching the subject to  | and occupying the presidency of the college was not unusual . Textbooks were written to review the European literature , and there was a certain amount of original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to reduce it to almost complete oblivion . An attempt is being made to review and to restore this work to the main stream of historical scholarship. ; Between 1880 and 1895 , psychology in the United States was transformed in a dramatic and sweeping fashion.4 By 1895 there were twenty-four psychology laboratories , three journals , and a flourishing scientific society , many of whose members were full-time psychologists . The new psychology had made its appearance , yet in 1880 , only fifteen years before , none of this had existed . The antecedents for these changes were to be found in the system of higher education that prevailed at the beginning of this period and the reaction in the United States to the German university system . HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES Before the Civil War , one-curriculum colleges prevailed with their emphasis upon Latin , Greek , mathematics , and philosophy . What little instruction existed in the physical sciences was offered without laboratory work of any kind.5 At that time educational theory was based upon a faculty psychology . This phase of the Scottish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline . The faculties of the students were to be exercised by those subjects which , to use the words of Jeremiah Day , President of Yale in the early decades of the century , are " best calculated to teach the art of fixing the attention , directing the train of thought , analyzing a subject proposed for investigation , following with accurate discrimination the course of argument ; balancing nicely the evidence presented to the judgment ; awakening , elevating , and controlling the imagination ; arranging , with skill , the treasures which memory gathers ; rousing and guiding the power of genius .... " 6 Scientific work was carried on almost entirely outside the colleges in a manner reminiscent of England , but without the saving grace of the well-to-do amateur . The establishment of scientific schools , beginning with those at Rensselaer , Yale , and Harvard , helped to break this exclusion , although they were isolated from the colleges . The medical schools also began to contribute , although they did not do a great deal to encourage research . Much of what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enrollments actually declined as colleges became more and more out of touch with the times , while the number of students going abroad to Germany and Austria  | for graduate study increased. ? In 1880 there were about as many graduate students abroad as there were in all of the United States . As we have seen , the German universities were dominated by the idea of research , and the teacher had considerable amount of freedom to work on problems of his choice and , within the limits of his field , to choose to teach what he wished . There was also the complementary freedom of the student to study what and when he chose . Above all , the German universities were the scientific centers of the world , due to the effectiveness of their research . Educators reacted vigorously to the example of the German universities . After the Civil War , a strong movement sprang up to extend the scope and improve the quality of university education . To mention only three college presidents from among the leaders , Eliot of Harvard , ( despite an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Johns Hopkins were all influenced by the German university system in the changes they introduced at their respective institutions . As a result , these three schools figure prominently in the account that follows . In addition , Clark University , whose first president was G. Stanley Hall , was avowedly modeled on European graduate schools . Stanford University and the University of Chicago were also to come into prominence as examples of the new trend . Meanwhile a gradual reform and reorganization of the so-called graduate schools already in operation was taking place at such universities as Harvard , Yale , and Princeton . These older schools had suffered loss of'students , a lowered prestige , and the services of some of their abler professors to the new graduate schools ; so they , too , incorporated the German university pattern into their graduate schools . Reform took place through the introduction of the elective system to replace the fixed curriculum . This resulted in an increase not only in the number of courses but also in the number of departments offering them , such as the modern languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all was the establishment of graduate schools to take the place of the fifth year in residence which , heretofore , had led to the M.A. degree based on an extension of college work . Johns Hopkins , opening its doors in 1876 , as a graduate school , was the leader in this field , with an independent research project required of each student . In these changes psychology occupied a favored and strategic position . It was one of the " new " subjects introduced into colleges and universities from the German system . Whereas psychology was still located in the departments of philosophy in German universities , the introduction of the subject in schools in the United States often meant the creation of an independent department . It also supplied a weapon to attack faculty psychology . No matter what the differences of opinion among the first American psychologists , they were united  | in their opposition to faculty psychology . Moreover , the economic and social conditions prevailing under the pioneer spirit made application of psychology almost a foregone conclusion . As Albrecht8 reminds us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than years necessarily marking scientific advances themselves . Consequently , in what follows it is not only the research articles on scientific problems that will be of concern , but also psychology as a social institution and the men who helped to make it . // Suitably muted as befits the field , an academician 's moment of truth comes when he hears the citation read during the awarding of an honorary degree . The moment for William James was to come at the Harvard commencement of 1903 . We do not know his reaction to the award itself , but more accessible is what happened before this moment . According to his son , Henry , he went about for days , half in jest , half in earnest , dreading to hear President Eliot pronounce him " psychologist. " 1 ? He was not a psychologist , he insisted , but a philosopher . In spite of himself , William James was the first of the new psychologists in the United States . Not only on occasion did he deny that he was a psychologist ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add to these paradoxes , he was not primarily a founder , certainly not an adherent , and not even an experimentalist . He founded no system of psychology and lacked disciples . There were to be no Jamesians as there were Wundtians . He drew the inspiration for his position concerning psychology , not from one man or one movement , but from a combination of sources in such fashion as to be selfinitiated . He knew of the developments in German experimental psychology , and he assimilated some aspects , rejected others , but was guided by none of them . He showed similar independent selectivity about British associationism and French psychopathology . In spite of all of this , William James was the first great psychologist in the United States . Life and Interests Just before the beginning of the nineteenth century , the founder of the James family in America , William 's grandfather , came from Ireland . Beginning with a meager capital , he amassed a fortune through business ventures and investments . Among his thirteen children by three wives was Henry , senior , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their father never worked in the accepted sense of the tern ) . Instead he devoted his lime to  | religious questions in which he struggled to give utterance to his deep but unorthodox beliefs . He was especially influenced by Swedenborg and found his mission in life in writing a series of books , essays , and pamphlets , which made , however , so little impression upon others that William Dean Howells was to say of him that , " He had written a book about the Secret of Swedenborg ' and had kept it . " 11 Nevertheless , wherever Henry went in his ceaseless travels , he had distinguised friends . Ralph Waldo Emerson in particular impressed him , although in later life he found Emerson lacking in intellectual coherence and showing too blithe a dismissal of the reality of evil . William was born in New . York City , in January 1842 . His brother Henry was also born in New York City , fourteen months later . Their father devoted himself enthusiastically to their education , alternating between rushing them off to Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American schools and then bringing them home because of an equally strong feeling that his children should be with their own kind . Extensive travel and sporadic schooling in the United States , England , France , Switzerland , and Germany followed for William and Henry and their younger brothers and sisters . They studied with tutors and in various kinds of schools , learning even more from the galleries , museums , and theatres of the cities they visited . Unlike the rigors that faced John Stuart Mill in having his education supervised by his father , they had a delightful , although unsettling time with their kindly , enthusiastic father . As befitting their very different personalities , Henry and William later flatly disagreed on the value of their schooling . William regretted its lack of discipline and drill which he believed interfered with his developing an ability for orderly rigorous thinking ; Henry found it invaluable in stirring the free play of curiosity . Although there was but a year 's difference in age between the two , William , then and later , was the " big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly and with much greater assurance than did Henry . In later years William vigorously criticized his brother 's writing with no complaint or impatience being shown by Henry . Finally , Henry calmly declared his independence which , in everything but name , had been his all along . There was a very deep affection between the brothers , although in many respects they were utterly unlike . Henry , who became a naturalized British subject late in life , reflected at least the stereotype of the formal and reserved Englishmen , as expatriates have been known to do , while William , despite his cosmopolitan experiences , was still something of the breezy American . I I. C. ' ells I2 tells a story which illustrates neatly the brothers differences in this regard : In later veers when the brothers were famous , Wells came to visit  | them while they were in England and found Henry very upset . Henry appealed to Wells to tell his brother what is and is not done . It seems that William had happened upon a small inn whose garden was separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which G. K. Chesterton , the British writer , was staying . With American directness William had placed the gardener 's ladder against the wall , climbed up , and peeped over . And Henry had caught him at it ! Following the advice of his father who insisted that a hasty decision would be wrong and " narrowing , " William took years to decide upon the work for which he was most fitted . He tried painting for six months at the studio of William Morris Hunt in Newport , Rhode Island , but realized his lack of promise to be an outstanding painter . In the autumn of 1861 , at the age of nineteen , William enrolled at the Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard University ; by now his choice of future career had been narrowed down to the sciences and philosophy . Despite his interest in chemistry on which he first concentrated , William 's teachers observed an impatience which drove him away from accurate , painstaking laboratory determination , prophetic of his distaste for such work throughout his life . He soon left chemistry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medical school , despite the already formed conviction that the practice of medicine held no attraction . In 1865 he went with Louis Agassiz to the Amazon as a trial of a possible career in biology , but he soon found that he hated collecting . On his return he resumed his medical studies , interrupting them again to go abroad for two years , because he felt that he did not have the stamina to continue the arduous work . Indecision about a career was now complicated by a neurotic depression with insomnia , eye trouble , digestive disorders , very severe back pain , and other symptoms which lasted for nearly five years . There was even some preoccupation with thoughts of suicide , but he managed to put them aside , even being able to write home to his father in a carefully restrained fashion that " thoughts of the pistol , the dagger , and the bowl began to usurp an unduly large part of my attention ; and I began to think that some change .. . was necessary . " 13 During this trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he considered the time had come for psychology to begin to be a science and that he had decided to do some work in it.14 He also mentioned plans to go to Heidelberg to work with Helmholtz and Wundt , but , whatever the reason , he merely was to catch a glimpse of them and no more . I1is knowledge of their work attests to his general alertness to contemporary developments in psychology . This visit was in 1868 , only eight years after R'ecliner 's l ' ; IenenIs had appeared .  | He returned to the United States to take his medical degree in 1869 . It was " obvious " to William , to his friends , and his family that he could not practice , and , since his back pain precluded standing for long hours , laboratory work , too , was out of the question . He resolved that summer to continue to work in " psychological subjects . " 15 A philosophical crisis preceded the beginning of a partial recovery from his various ills . Feeling lost and alone , and , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as filled with evil , William read the evolutionary philosophy of Renouvier 's Second Essay which persuaded him of the existence of the freedom of the will , that spontaneity is available to him who makes it so . James resolved that his " ... first act of free will shall be to believe in free will . " 16 This apparently delivered him from the clutches of the strict determinism of Mill , Spencer , and Bain and opened up the way to his becoming a philosophical psychologist . In 1872 he received an offer from President Eloit to teach physiology at Harvard , which he accepted . By this time a gradual recovery of his health was taking place . Despite the lure of more general philosophical issues , after the first year he felt he should continue but postponed a decision and finally decided to take a year off to be with his brother in Italy . He then returned and resumed teaching . In 1875 James gave his first course in psychology on the relation between physiology and psychology , thus moving closer to his now established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he put it , the first lecture he ever heard , he gave himself . It was in 1875 ( the same year as Wundt ) that William James established the other of the two first psychological laboratories in the world.17 In retrospect James , himself , was not sure whether it was 1874 , 1875 or 1876 , but the new evidence found by Harper in the references cited above demonstrate it to have been 1875 . One especially compelling item he cites is the report of the Harvard Treasurer of that year which cites an appropriation to James of $300 , for use in physiology . Other evidence , including the nature of his 1875 course mentioned earlier , shows that it was equipment for physiological psychology . Therefore , it would seem a laboratory in psychology was found at Harvard in 1875 by James . It was located in Lawrence Hall . In 1876 James was advanced to Assistant Professor of Physiology . O.
