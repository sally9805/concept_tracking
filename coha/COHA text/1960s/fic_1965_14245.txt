The dark shadow of evening comes moving in from the eastern ocean and spreading its vast wings over Florida and Anastasia Island . Opposite and to the west the fan-spread of fires reaching up the sky dies out before it and the red circular-saw disc of the sun which has already begun to cut deep into the body of the recumbent earth with its fiery jagged teeth now sinks down and under out of sight . The audience is gathering in the amphitheatre for the play . The muffled and shadowed big Center Stage in front stands silent and waiting . So do the various acting areas to the Right and the Left and the deep woods beyond  --  the whole making a wide sweeping arc all " charged up " for the drama and where action may break out at any time . A great cathedral bell starts tolling off at the Right rear . The play is ready to begin . The audience lights blink twice , and as the bell gives a few more tollings , these lights go down to halfdim . The bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening hymn and plays it through once . A chorus of men , women and children 's voices bursts into song off-scene in the direction of the bell , the music accompanying . This singing is both live and taped  --  the unseen chorus singing live around properly placed microphones . The song spreads through the sound system until it permeates and envelops the amphitheatre . The audience grows quiet , and each one can begin to be alone with his own thoughts . The vibrant harmony fills the night-falling air with benediction and grace . And in some listening hearts the feelings of sweet devotion and peace are awakened with touches of bliss even and of adoration here and there before the mystery of the Triune God , his Son , the Holy Virgin Mary , and the redemption of man 's soul from sin and death  --  man the mystery-mysterium on this spinning compulsed globe , man meditating , man thinking under the open starry sky , a communion with nature , nature likewise a mysterium . CHORUS Almighty and eternal Lord , &nbsp; &nbsp; Of truth and love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , &nbsp; &nbsp; To glorify thy name.Let ages pass or come to birth , &nbsp; &nbsp; Let nations rise or fall , Beyond the breaking of the earth , &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou standest Lord of all .

A-men . ( The singing dies away . The theatre music reprises the last bars of the hymn , then fades down and out . There is a moment of pause , and the LIGHT comes up at the Right front . The NARRATOR enters there . He is a Spanish peasant sort of man of middle age , heavily bearded , and dressed in clean stout clothes  --  a low-crowned cloth cap , plain serge coat , calico shirt , coarse trousers , wool stockings and flat shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamically to the audience. ) p. 3 NARRATOR We are met to commemorate the founding of St. Augustine here four hundred years ago . With its beginning the United States began . European civilization in this land was first planted here  --  22 years before Sir Walter Raleigh 's lost colony at Roanoke , 42 years before the English settlement at Jamestown , and 55 years before the landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth Rock . From this town many of the principles of practical and religious faith which over the years have become a part of the American heritage were bequeathed to us  --  and bequeathed through tremendous labor and tough endurance and lasting sacrifice . The very mortar of the old walls and buildings of our ancient city is mixed in with the bones and marrow and soakings of blood of our early forefathers . This amphitheatre where we are gathered tonight to tell their story is more than a theatre . It is a shrine , a memorial shrine . For many of the stirring events depicted in our play took place in and around this very spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is Basilio Bonito  --  at least I play a character by that name in the drama . I was here in the long-ago days of St. Augustine 's beginning . Our play opens in the city of Seville in Spain in the year fifteen hundred and sixty-five . It is an evening in early spring , and a religious procession is making its way to the old cathedral there to pray for the safety of friends and loved ones in peril on the deep . But the hero of our play , Pedro Menendez de Aviles , is not in the procession . He watches from his prison cell there in the Royal Arsenals , even as he yearns for his release and dreams of the new land of Florida . ( He bows , replaces his cap and retires . The great CATHEDRAL BELL begins tolling again off-scene as before , tolling from the Giralda Tower in Seville Cathedral now , and a sound of people chanting and singing is heard approaching at the Left . A shaft of GOLDEN LIGHT is shot across the Center Stage from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a religious procession . Two altar boys swinging their smoking censers are in front . Behind them walks BROTHER DOMINGO DE FLORIDA , an Indian cleric about 21 years old , carrying a tall white cross . Then following him is the resplendent image of the Virgin borne aloft on a silken palanquin  --  a dazzling vision of loveliness with her crown of gold , necklace of pearls , and star-studded blue mantle . After the image come the people of the town  --  men and women and a few children , and finally the black-hooded figures of some six or seven penitents each bearing a heavy cross . As the procession moves along , the people are chanting and singing. ) p. 4 PEOPLE Ave maris stella , Dei Mater almeAtque semper Virgo , Felix caeli porta . Sumens illud AveGabrielis ore , Funda nos in pace.Mutans Evae nomen . Solve vincla reis , Profer lumen caecis , Mala nostra pelle , Bona cuncta posce .

The LIGHT comes up there , showing him bent over a rough table and studying some maps and manuscripts . On the wall behind him is a large crucifix . Although he is a man of square and powerful upstanding frame and normally active and agile out in the world for all his late middle age , here in this place of confinement he shows to be a ragged and bearded pitiful prisoner . He rises and stares out as he hears the religious service passing . Clapping his hands together in pleading , he calls to the passing Virgin in a huge hoarse voice . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Turn thou , most gracious Advocate , thine eyes of healing toward me , thy unworthy servant , Pedro Menendez ! O sweet Virgin Mary ! To thee do I send up my sighs , my mourning and my weeping in this hole of tears ! ( He bows his head over . The procession goes on . Some of the women are weeping , filled with emotion as they follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed in the liturgicals proper to the occasion  --  a full-flowing alb , cincture and stole  --  comes along after the procession . He is a kindly energetic man of thirty-five or more . MENENDEZ stares out at him with bloodshot eyes and calls loudly . ) Pray for me , Father ! p. 5 FATHER LOPEZ ( Stopping and making the sign of the cross in the air . ) I do , my son . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES That my unjust punishment be ended . FATHER LOPEZ I am praying for thy soul  --  even as we now gather to pray for the galleon long overdue from the New World . The citizens of Seville fear for their loved ones . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Yea , I doubt not the French pirates have once more taken their toll in the wild waters of Florida . ( Ragingly . ) Eigh , Father , the waste and ruin our country suffers there in that land ! Day and night I study these maps and books and make my plans how it could be altered . But these bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pantomimically grabs at the invisible bars in front of his face . ) And here I rot . FATHER LOPEZ Be humble , my son , and God will preserve thee . Be humble . ( He makes the sign of the cross in the air again . ) Pax Domini sit semper tecum . ( He goes on out at the Right . MENENDEZ calls angrily after him . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Yea , I am humble enough before my blessed God and his most Holy Church ! But never will I bend the begging knee before my enemies who have shut me in these vile walls . Nay ! ( The singing , which has softened down now , swells back in an instant and then fades out entirely . The LIGHT dies out on the Center Stage and rises more strongly in MENENDEZ ' cell . He turns about the narrow place , the hot words spilling from him . ) Oh , that my thirsty blade could slake its parched tongue in the blood of these traitors and betrayers  --  blood cold as their father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He begins pecking at the maps and documents on the table . ) Aye , betrayers , not only of me but of his majesty and Florida itself ! ( The LIGHT widens a bit , and now we notice that a soldier in armor and with a pennanted pike is standing on guard in the shadow at the Left front . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ enters from the shadows at the Left rear . With him is a second soldier armed and dressed like the first . The two soldiers go through the short ritual of changing the guard , CAPTAIN ALBAREZ receiving their salutes . He and the first guard move over to the Right . In the light we see that ALBAREZ is a tall , well-built young man of twenty-eight or thirty , lithe-figured , serious-faced and weather-tanned from wind and sun . His hair is blond , and he wears a moustache and close-trimmed beard in the fashion of the times. ) p. 6 CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ ( To the FIRST GUARD . ) How goes it with the general ? Well ? FIRST GUARD Nay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Touching his finger to the side of his head . ) I fear his brains are firing to madness itself in the heat of his distempers . More and more he talks to hisself like another man , and this day he leapt up with a loud squeal and called for his sword , and he kept calling ! Then he knelt in prayer at the cross and was quiet . ( Taking off his helmet . ) Ah , Holy Mother of God , have pity on him ! CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ Amen . And she will ! He will yet be freed , and ere long we 'll be sailing the ocean seas with him once more  --  you and I. FIRST GUARD God grant it be so ! CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ Get thee to rest . The hour grows late . ( The SOLDIER replaces his helmet , salutes and goes briskly away into the shadows . ALBAREZ turns toward the cell , the LIGHT brightens there . He calls out . ) Your Excellency ! ( MENENDEZ springs up and comes quickly toward him . ) PEDRO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his majesty ! p. 7 CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ ( Shaking his head . ) Nay . But soon , soon , I swear it . Every hour your freedom draws nearer . I feel it . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Harshly . ) The weather changing in thy bones , it is . ( Beating his hands together . ) Why , why , does his majesty not heed my supplications ? He knows my heart . Every throb is a bell that rings my loyalty to him . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ Your enemies at court are powerful , sir . They control the purse strings to the nation 's wealth . The king is dependent on their ducats . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Aye , ducats they have piled up from their robbings and embezzlings of his majesty 's treasure fleets from New Spain . The same they accuse me of . Thus they stink over the trail that leads to them . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ Your petitions will yet be answered . And mark ye , the petitions of the men who have served under you are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weigh much . Any moment now , any moment ! And we will all flock again to thy summoning . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( His voice filled with emotion . ) Bless thee , dear lad . ( He sticks his hand through the invisible bars and ALBAREZ grasps it. ) p. 8 CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ Command me , sir . ( A SERVITOR brings in a covered dish . ) Your dinner . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Nay , I crave no food tonight . These new world maps and books of Florida have set my brains on fire . ( Clenching his shaggy fists in the air . ) I feel swelling in me the power to triumph in that new world certain and unafraid  --  serving his majesty and my God ! ( Shouting to the SERVITOR . ) Take it away ! ( The SERVITOR flees . MENENDEZ sinks down on a stool , chuckling grimly . ) Rather let me feast on bitter thoughts and drink the salt tears running down into my mouth  --  my own . ( Calling off . ) For God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can give me rest now  --  music and my prayers . ( Growling . ) But then I dream so . Visions and dreams ! ( He grinds his clenched fists against his temples . ) CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ ( Calling . ) Ho ! Music ! ( MENENDEZ raises his head and stares off . He speaks now as if unconscious of ALBAREZ ' presence . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Roaring . ) Yea , blessed be God and the most Holy Mother of Christ , I still keep my faith and shall keep it ! ( Striking his breast a savage blow . ) In here I am guiltless , in here I know I 've done no wrong . And the rightness of my conscience and the rightness of my soul shall sustain me beyond their lies , their malice and their iron . p. 9 CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ It shall . ( Saluting . ) Good night , sir . I shall soon bring news . ( He goes . MENENDEZ looks about him , then turns and picks up some of the maps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to settle Florida , ye schemers and dreamers gutted with greed ? Yea , each my country 's shame  --  Ponce de Leon , Hernando de Soto , Narvaez , Fray Luis Cancer , Don Tristan de Luna  --  failures and betrayers all . ( He throws the maps from him , rakes the books violently from the table , then flings himself down on his plank bed which is attached to the wall . Off-scene the MUSIC begins to play  --  a flute , violin and guitar . The LIGHT irises in on him as he lies there a wretched hairy figure , his eyes closed and his craggy hawklike features illumined in the light . The largo easing of the instruments slides into the scene . Then presently the music begins to take on an eerie dissonantic quality . Now the high treble of the theatre music mixes in as MENENDEZ sleeps and begins his turbulent dreaming . And as he dreams , a pale blue LIGHT rises behind a scrim on the Center Stage high up to the rear to depict that dream . And from his cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which the dream helps evoke  --  as well as to accompany the action . The words come out in a sort of all-pervasive whisper , heard in the sound track . ) Hah  --  hah ! Hail , thou mad fellow  --  old Ponce de Leon ! Marching , marching in search of thyself ! ( As MENENDEZ talks in the sound track , we see the figures of DE LEON and some of his MEN materialize on the Center Stage behind the scrim . PONCE is a graybearded man of some sixty or more . Now occurs the choreographed action of PONCE DE LEON 'S search in the wilderness of Florida for waters to restore his lost youth . MENENDEZ ' mockery continues in the sound track . ) Why art thou not colonizing , old Ponce ? Why art thou not building  --  spreading the gospel of our blessed Savior to the lost and undone ? Ah , thou fool , seeking the fountain of youth that never was and never shall be . God intended man to grow old . Go to , thy fate awaits thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , PONCE with his men continues his search . We see him pushing through the invisible underbrush , pushing , pushing , his men pushing with him and wading , wading as if hip-deep in the water of some great swamp . The MEN weaken , they plead with their leader to turn back , but PONCE is half-mad now and shows it in the way he lets loose a pantomime of fury . The pushing on is resumed . Now a metallic pizzicato strikes in the music , and the Fountain of Youth appears there beyond , rising up out of the woods  --  hazy and dreamy at first and then clearer as PONCE 'S disordered brain visualizes it . We see the fountain with him , but his men do not . They stop and stand in attitudes of complete exhaustion . There a few yards away we see streamlets of water gushing and splashing upward and falling in a silvery radiant shower of raindrops downward . And in the falling streams of the bewitched water appears the naked figure of a beautiful godlike youth . PONCE sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pantomime bespeaks his joy . From the sound track comes MENENDEZ ' raucous jeering cry . ) You 've found it , Ponce , the Fountain of Youth ! You 've found it . See  --  see ! It is thyself there  --  young once more ! And ready for joy and love again ! Hurry , Ponce , hurry , women 's sweet arms await thee ! Hah ! Hah ! Thou mad fool ! ' T is an Indian arrow that awaits ! ( PONCE 'S gasp of joy and wonder is simulated in the sound track , and with open arms he rushes toward the Fountain . Suddenly the music changes into its twisted snarl , and then the " plomp " of an arrow hitting its mark is heard . PONCE grabs his wounded side with his hand and falls to the ground , the sound track uttering his death scream as he falls . His MEN awakened to action again turn reachingly toward him . In the distance a trumpet call is heard . The scene fades out . The MUSIC stops , and the LIGHT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sitting up listening . The trumpet sounds once more . He springs excitedly to his feet . CAPTAIN ALBAREZ ' voice is heard off at the Left rear , calling : ) p. 10 ALBAREZ ' VOICE Don Pedro ! Don Pedro Menendez ! ( He comes running in accompanied by the jailer with a great key . He is waving a letter in his hand . ) The king has heard you ! He summons you to Madrid at once ! ( He hands the letter through the bars . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Blessed be God on high ! ( He stretches out his arms and looks gratefully up , and then devours the letter with his eyes . ) CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ Unlock , master jailer , unlock ! Let the general go free ! ( The door is pantomimically unlicked now , and the JAILER turns and goes away . MENENDEZ comes slowly and half-wonderingly out of his cell . He moves a few steps forward and falls on his knees , reaching his great arms to the night and breathing in huge lungfuls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DE AVILES Oh sweet and happy air ! Oh thou vast and lovely night ! And oh ye joyous dancing stars ! Look down on God 's poor servant who now lives again ! ( Leaning over to an invisible flower . ) And thou child of light , thou silver jasmine , I grow drunk with thy perfume . And this sweet earth , this fruited happy earth ! ( He bends over and kisses the earth and then climbs to his feet . He embraces ALBAREZ . ) God bless thee , dear lad ! ( ALBAREZ hides his emotion . He gestures to the SOLDIER on guard who salutes and goes away . MENENDEZ takes a few steps back and forth as if trying out his legs . He turns and looks at his cell . ) Farewell , thou silent living tomb . Farewell to the dirt and rats and fiends of loneliness . Farewell to empty dreams ! And hail to dreams that shall come true ! ( With a joyous cry as he turns back to ALBAREZ , feeling his beard and slapping himself the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barber , and then away to the king ! p. 11 CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ To the king ! ( MENENDEZ goes dashing away into the shadows at the Right on his wavering weak legs , followed by the happy ALBAREZ . They have hardly disappeared when as if from the sky the ANGELUS sounds , coming now from the great Giralda Tower of the nearby cathedral . The light in and around the cell dies out . From the high distance the chanting and intoning of many voices , led by a priest , spill downward . ) PRIEST 'S VOICE Angelus Domini nuntiavit Mariae . PEOPLE 'S VOICES Et concepit de spiritu sancto . Ave Maria . PRIEST 'S VOICE Ecce ancilla Domini . PEOPLE 'S VOICES Sanctus , sanctus , sanctus , Dominus Deus Sabaoth . Pleni sunt caeli et terra gloria tua . Hosanna in excelsis ! ( The scene fades away as the Angelus dies . The MUSIC reprises a bit of the opening hymn and dies away also . There is an instant of pause . Suddenly a flood of amplified guitar MUSIC bursts from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there. ) p. 12 Act 1 , Scene 2 SCENE 2 A room in the Royal Palace in Madrid . A glittering scene . A number of flag-bearers are appearing on the upper platform at the rear to stand there and frame the action with huge banners and gonfalons , these pretty much serving in the place of scenery and giving a splashing display of gold , crimson , blue , green and orange colors to the surroundings . It is fiesta time in the city , and a number of courtiers , noblemen , military leaders and chief citizens with their ladies are pushing in at the Right front on the lower level to make a merry night of it together here in the palace . A gold-cloth table is slid in at the Right by two serving men to furnish the assemblage with food and drink if feasible . A few of the celebrants are already somewhat in their cups and are whooping it up as five or six young Spanish girls made up to resemble Gypsies come whirling in in a fiery dance , their castanets and tambourines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark-eyed and impetuous , and her close friend , BARBARA AZEDO , quieter and less outspoken . Most of the men in this scene would be fitting representatives for a future Velasquez painting  --  with their plumed hats , thick and tended brushed-back locks , waxed mustaches and pointed beards , their rich Spanish capes and mantles of silk and satin and ermine , their panel-embroidered vests , their Italian doublets padded and boned , their high white linen collars stiff and wired , and with trunk hose and stockings to match . Some of them too wear fancy shoes tied with jeweled ribbon rosettes . And the women would be fitting representatives too  --  with their elaborate skirts , bodices , hair-dos , kerchiefs , fans and jewels . The dance throbs and turmoils about the scene , and scattered cries and slappings of hands mix in with the beating staccato of the girls ' castanets and tambourines . And ever the merry off-scene guitars keep pouring their delirious melodies and harmo nies in . MEN 'S AND WOMEN 'S VOICES Ole ! Ole ! Ayh ! Viva ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three minutes , and some of the other courtiers swing a few of their ladies wildly about the room . A breaking fanfare of trumpets sounds off at the Right. ) p. 13 WOMEN 'S VOICES The king ! MEN 'S VOICES The king ! ( The MUSIC and dance stop . The royal MUSIC begins offscene  --  trumpets and woodwinds , punctuated by a low rhythmic beat of a small drum . The girls gather over at the Left in a group . Some of the noblemen and courtiers straighten their dress , and so do the ladies . The flag-bearers remain a stiff and motionless part of the stage set . The CHAMBERLAIN comes in along the upper level at the Right with his mace . He is a thin spidery fellow of middle age and somewhat foppishly dressed . He strikes the floor for attention and begins his bravura announcement above the music . ) THE KING 'S CHAMBERLAIN ( In a high tenor voice . ) Don Felipe the Second , by the grace of God King of Castile , of Aragon , of Leon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Toledo , of Valencia , of Mayorca , of Galicia , of Sevilla , of Sardinia , of Cordova , of Corsica  --  ( At the first of these titles the people are standing erect , but with each added one their heads and bodies incline a bit until they are well bent over .

PHILIP , carrying a rolled document in his hand , follows , and after him comes the Spanish ambassador to France , SENOR PERRENOT DE CHANTONE , a bearded middle-aged man colorfully dressed in the fashion of the times and in keeping with the other courtiers and nobles in the scene . Next comes a bearer in livery with an embroidered crimson and gold chair-seat .

( The procession turns at the Left , comes down to a second level of platform and moves to the Right as the music continues . The people are bowed low before their approaching monarch now , and EVA GONZALES and BARBARA AZEDO have knelt . The cardinal stops and steps back . PHILIP at this time is 38 years old , lightly bearded and mustached , of medium height , somewhat slender but of hidden athletic strength in his deceptive frame . His dress is rather plain . He is usually a quiet-mannered and unemphatic man and of a relaxed way of speaking . But when fired up over matters of importance to the throne or the church he can volley forth his words like shots  --  as we shall later find out . Though some-what timid , he is a man who knows what he wants . And what he wants most of all in these early years of his reign is still more glory and power for his country and a wider reach of salvation for his church .

And that noblest duty is to bring the light of the blessed gospel to the poor Indians who live in darkness there . Your Majesty , my lords , my heart aches for them .

With my people and your people united in love , no more will the blood of anger and hate darken the white sands of the Florida seas . ( He bows and steps back . PHILIP nods his head in strong approval of what he has said . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Domingo is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heavenly Father has bestowed on all his children of whatever color or race his precious talents and the endowment of an immortal soul . Let them but have a chance to develop these gifts ! ( Now reaching his great hands out pleadingly . ) Let us give Domingo 's people that chance . And then in their friendship and their love the city we build in Florida will be built to last through time . ( PHILIP sits leaning forward as he listens to MENENDEZ ' fervency and eloquence . ) DON RAMON PEREZ And I say no to this sweet brotherly song of love , Your Majesty . All the padres in Spain would not suffice to stuff the message of the cross into those narrow , darkened brains . It has been tried . Fray Luis Cancer with his missionaries tried it and met death . p. 21 DON HERON DE SAN VICENTE ( Stoutly . ) And Fray Juan de Padilla and Fray Luis de Escalona in the year ' 40 were slaughtered in cold blood by the inhuman wretches there . ( DOMINGO starts forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) DON RAMON PEREZ True , and Fray Diego de Penalosa and Padres Diego and Fuentes  --  murdered all . BROTHER DOMINGO DE FLORIDA ( Bursting out . ) My people were afraid  --  afraid  --  they knew no better . They had suffered from the Spanish muskets . Now Don Pedro will teach them love . GARCIA OSORIO And my voice is with Don Ramon . If you must settle there , then first make war upon these pagans and so exterminate them . From my experience in Cuba I know  --  I know . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Angrily . ) So with the sword of blood , Garcia Osorio , you would destroy the cross of love and peace . God forbid we murder an innocent people ! ( He bows his head . PHILIP stands quickly up and comes forward . ) PHILIP THE SECOND So now I , your king , ask you for your support of my appointment of Pedro Menendez de Aviles as Captain General of the Ocean Seas and First Governor of Florida and for men and arms and funds to sustain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( He waits . A few of the group turn inward to confer . Two or three timid hands go up . PHILIP speaks out bitterly . ) I see ye all sweat anxiously to get back to your pleasures , and so ye say me nay . p. 22 DON HERON DE SAN VICENTE Nay it must be , Your Majesty . PHILIP THE SECOND ( Loudly . ) And so by your vote you would leave the mainland of Florida still a waiting wilderness alone and unprotected ? DON HERON DE SAN VICENTE ( Nodding . ) So we decide , Your Majesty . Let us use our fleet to strengthen Havana . ( He turns to GOVERNOR OSORIO . ) GARCIA OSORIO In truth ; Your Majesty . That is our need  --  a strong Havana . PHILIP THE SECOND But that is far to the south . And Florida would remain an open invitation for our enemies to plant a settlement there and claim the land as their own by so doing . DON RAMON PEREZ ( Scoffingly . ) No nation would dare the mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border . PHILIP THE SECOND And if our enemy should ? If France should plant such a settlement ? DON HERON DE SAN VICENTE Why then , Your Grace , we would rouse our nation to wrath against her . We would put all resources to the service of the throne . DON RAMON PEREZ Yea , on the honor of a Spaniard we say so  --  open the vaults of our banks for men and arms . But why trouble thy gentle head with borrowings of trouble that will never be ? Let us have music , and now  --  p. 23 PHILIP THE SECOND And you would swear to that promise ? DON HERON DE SAN VICENTE ( Indulgently , as before . ) We would , O gracious sovereign ! VOICES Yes , yes , Your Majesty . This vow is sworn of old . ( PHILIP reaches back and takes a dispatch from CHANTONE . ) PHILIP THE SECOND I accept your promise  --  your vow  --  as men of honor . ( Quietly . ) My Lords , two years ago I urged upon you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face of the rising boldness of France and England with their pirates . Last year I urged it again lest the enemies of our Church and throne feel we had grown fat and lazy and so invade our kingdom there . Each time I pleaded in vain . Today I urged the same  --  and once more ye said me nay with your voice and your ducats . ( Tapping the dispatch with his finger , and going on almost with innocent understatement . ) This dispatch full and complete  --  because of its importance was brought from Paris by Ambassador Chantone himself . My people , the French under their captains Jean Ribaut and Rene Laudoniere have already planted a colony in Florida . ( For a moment there is a stretch of unbelieving silence . The light now flares out and includes the women and girls as they turn back into the scene. ) p. 24 VOICES Impossible ! Nay , it can not be ! OTHER VOICES ( In a bedlam . ) They 've broken the treaty ! It should mean war ! War ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( The noise finally subsides , and they turn to the KING to hear more . ) PHILIP THE SECOND ( Quietly as before . ) The colony is planted on our own St. John 's River which the pirates have renamed the River May , some forty leagues above our ancient Cape Canaveral . They call it Fort Caroline after their king . It is a settlement of French Huguenots . VOICES ( Loudly . ) Heretics ! OTHER VOICES Lutherans ! DON RAMON PEREZ And deadly enemies to our faith ! OTHER VOICES Burn them ! Kill them ! EVA GONZALES ( Her dark eyes flashing . ) And while the brave men of Spain stand here debating , the French no doubt are busy preparing more men and supplies to strengthen their colony in Florida . ( Calling ) Is it not so , Captain Jose Albarez ? PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Well spoken , Senorita . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ ( Straight and serious as always , and embarrassed . ) I think it so , dear lady . p. 25 DON HERON DE SAN VICENTE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does your voice intrude on this assembly ? EVA GONZALES By the right of Spain herself  --  I am her daughter . ( Gesturing toward the group of women . ) So are we all loyal ones . ( Some of the women nod their approval . Others shrink timidly together , alarmed at EVA 'S temerity . BARBARA AZEDO comes out and stands with her . ) And Barbara Azedo . BARBARA AZEDO True , true , we are ! EVA GONZALES We would not fear to sail with thee , Don Pedro Menendez , for the settling of Florida . ( She puts her arm around BARBARA and looks up at CAPTAIN ALBAREZ again . ) Mayhap Captain Albarez the soldier thinks us forward and unwomanly . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ ( Swallowing and glancing at the KING . ) By your leave , Your Majesty , I think it not . Spain 's women , like her men , are brave . And Florida hath need of them for the making of homes . I am only a soldier but so it seems . ( He shifts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I hold the captain 's kind words dear in my heart . p. 26 PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( His voice singing out . ) Let us prepare a fleet at once . Give me ships , the men , the arms and with such brave women to aid us  --  ( He bows slightly toward EVA and BARBARA. ) we will settle Florida and drive out the pirates that befoul His Majesty 's fair kingdom . The days of spring are fast going . We should move with all speed ! VOICES Vote , vote ! ( Instantly all hands are raised , including those of the enthusiastic EVA and BARBARA , and some of the people in their fervid emotion jump and prance about . ) PHILIP THE SECOND ( Strongly . ) It is so decreed ! VOICES God bless Your Majesty ! OTHER VOICES The King ! The King ! STILL OTHERS Viva ! Viva ! EVA GONZALES Viva Pedro Menendez ! VOICES Menendez ! Menendez ! ( PHILIP reaches for MENENDEZ ' sword . He holds it with the hilt up like a cross and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) PHILIP THE SECOND ( With a touch of fanatical zeal in his voice . ) You , Pedro Menendez de Aviles , as your soul shall hope for salvation from the eternal fires of hell , do solemnly swear that you will plant a settlement in Florida , build a city and forts and missions there , that you will destroy with fire and blood the colony of French heretics and pirates who have broken into our domain  --  or  --  ( His voice rising. ) you will leave your bones in that land as a witness to the struggle you have waged  --  so help you God . ( He waits again. ) p. 27 PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Kissing the cross-hilt of his sword . ) I do so swear ! A CARDINAL OF THE CHURCH ( Lifting his hands and speaking in a great phlegmy confirming voice . ) In Nomine Patris , et Filii , et Spiritus Sancti . Amen . PEOPLE ( As all cross themselves . ) Amen . ( MENENDEZ rises and PHILIP returns him his sword , then fastens a gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conceal his envy . ) PHILIP THE SECOND As a mark of my special favor I bestow on you this golden chain , gift to me from my sainted father . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Fervently . ) My thanks to thee , my sovereign . PHILIP THE SECOND ( Wiping his eyes with his bent forefinger . ) We will now repair to the chapel with his Grace  --  ( Indicating the CARDINAL. ) there to pray for the success of this expedition . On to Florida ! ( The royal MUSIC begins again . Led by the CARDINAL , the KING and his group move back the way they came . MENENDEZ and others follow. ) p. 28 VOICES Florida ! On to Florida ! ( They begin to chant . ) PEOPLE Benedictus Dominus , Deus Israel , Quita visitavit et redemit populum suum , Et erexit cornu salutis nobisEn domo David servi tui . ( They disappear into the shadows . DON HERON and DON RAMON , who have moved out of the group , stop over at the Right front in conference . EVA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still with a touch of mockery . ) And will you sail with Don Pedro to settle Florida , Captain Jose Albarez , and unafraid ? CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ I shall , Eva Gonzales . EVA GONZALES Then I would sail , too , and unafraid . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ You were ever daring for a girl  --  for a woman . ( A little stiffly . ) I fear your cherished beauty would find little flattery in that wilderness . And now your pardon , I must attend the general . ( He bows a little curtly and hurries away . She stares after him , then hurries to the Right where BARBARA has waited for her . The TWO GIRLS move after the others . Only DON HERON and DON RAMON are left alone in the scene. ) p. 29 DON HERON DE SAN VICENTE ( Continuing . ) What think ye now ? DON RAMON PEREZ Even as thee . We must be sparing with our ducats for this enterprise . The wars in the Low Countries come first . DON HERON DE SAN VICENTE Aye , tighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will waste our heart 's substance there in Florida . DON RAMON PEREZ ( Grimly . ) We shall see that he does not . DON HERON DE SAN VICENTE ( Chuckling . ) Aye , we agree . Come . ( Together they raise their voices piously in the chant and move away to the Right . ) THE TWO ( As they go . ) Sicut locutos est peros sanctorum , Quia saeculo sunt , prophetarum ejus  --  ( They go on out at the Right rear . The chanting in the distance is heard an instant and then fades out . Once more there is a moment of silence . Far-off at the Right front a great Indian drum begins to beat . It continues for a few seconds and stops . The sound of BASILIO BONITO 'S voice is heard in that direction singing a ballad and giving a guttural " hanh " now and then in punctuation to his song . The light comes up on the Right side-hillock. ) p. 30 Act 1 , Scene 3 SCENE 3 The Florida wilderness at the present site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our Lady of la Leche in St. Augustine . BASILIO BONITO , in the part of a Spanish castaway and slave to the Indians , is digging for sassafras roots with a heavy mattock  --  a mattock taken perhaps from the same wreck that cast him ashore . He is in scarecrow condition so far as his clothes go . During his long servitude he has patched and repatched his apparel until he wears only a few tatters of decaying rags . But for all his ruined and undone appearance , he seems to have a stout heart and is singing away at his ballad as he works . BASILIO BONITO ( The theatre guitar music accompanying him . ) ' T was in the merry springtime &nbsp; &nbsp; Of fifteen fifty-nine , I signed to go a-sailing &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the ocean brine , I said I 'd go a-sailing &nbsp; &nbsp; Four thousand miles awayTo gather gold and silver &nbsp; &nbsp; In the land of Floriday . Come out of there , old sassafras root ! ( He goes on . ) I said farewell to father , &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sara  --  ( Stopping and staring off , savoring the name in forlorn relish . ) Sara  --  Sara  --  uhm  --  thy blue eyes deep as the sky of heaven I remember . ( He straightens up , leans on his mattack handle and wipes the sweat from his face with curved hand , then looks out to the audience and speaks . ) Here I am , Basilio Bonito , digging old sassafras roots for my Indian master , Chief Oriba , in the wilds of Florida ! I was shipwrecked here in the long ago time , but day and night I pray and wait the coming of my countrymen to free me from my labors . ( Far off in the woods at the Right a wild and outlandish human screech is heard . ) " Yie  --  eh  --  eh  --  ay ! " ( BASILIO gestures in that direction . ) That be old Itufa , the Indian witchman , preparing for the mating dance of the Indian Princess Notina . She is a sister to Chief Oriba and at her birth the witchman foretold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose her for his wife . She has seen the wild geese go and come some fifty times across the sky  --  making her twenty-five years old  --  and the great warrior has never come . But if I may look ahead somewhat , I can tell you he is on his way here and with what a pother and wringling of circumstance you shall see . So it is that every year they dance before their heathen idol asking for a husband for the princess . She is a good girl . I 've taught her much of our speech  --  her brother , the chief , too  --  and I have hopes she will yet become a Christian . I made her a little cross out of cypress wood . ( A great hulking , long-shanked , middle-aged INDIAN MAN , wearing a patch over one eye , comes up behind BASILIO . He is naked save for his breech clout . In his hand he carries an oak withe to which is attached a long trailing length of deer rawhide for a whiplash . He cracks the lash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this and shows no surprise . He looks around at the INDIAN and grimaces. ) p. 31 INDIAN Dig sassafras , dog ! BASILIO BONITO I 'm digging  --  and I 'm no dog . You be a dog  --  watch-dog for Chief Oriba  --  old Apahola One-Eye . ( Old Buzzard One-Eye . ) APAHOLA ( Angrily . ) No apahola ! Basilio is ati  --  slave ! ( He spits and points the whip derisively at BASILIO . ) BASILIO BONITO True , true , I am a slave . But my blessed Father in Heaven will yet set me free . By this cross I do believe . ( He fingers a little cross he wears tied with a string about his neck and lifts his eyes . ) O Divine Father , like others shipwrecked here before me I teach these people the true language . And , Father , they abuse me in two tongues now , theirs and mine . ( He pries out a big root and holds it triumphantly up . ) That will make Chief Oriba an arroba of sassafras tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Come on , you slave . ) Come , dog , we go . ( He gestures for BASILIO to follow him . ) BASILIO BONITO Ni ponala , nariba apahola . I 'm coming , old Buzzard One-Eye . ( With the sassafras root in one hand and his shovel in the other BASILIO trots after BUZZARD ONE-EYE . They disappear into the shadows . The great Indian drum now begins to beat from the Right Center Stage , and old Itufa 's outlandish screech is heard again in that direction . The LIGHT fades out from the hillock and flares up on the Center Stage . Glaring out of the scene is an Indian idol  --  a totem pole creature about ten or twelve feet tall and sharpened at one end for sticking upright in the ground , with a hideous distorted sort of Aztec-god face , surmounted by a spread of wide-reaching deer antlers . Old Itufa the witchman , or shaman , is whirling about the idol , shaking his gourds violently as if taming the surrounding air . He is a rather terrifying creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted face . Now a shrill burst of Indian flute MUSIC is heard off-scene at the Right , and PRINCESS NOTINA and her MAIDS enter . They make a charming picture with their swamp-moss skirts and long dark hair tied in pony tails behind them by fibers of woodbine . NOTINA is willowy and graceful , and some years older than the others and wears a deerskin jacket colorfully decorated with drawings of birds and flowers denoting her princess rank . Each of the maidens carries a palm branch which she waves rhythmically in the air . ITUFA rushes around and kneels behind the idol , mouthing , growling and slobbering and shaking his gourds . NOTINA makes pantomimic love to the idol as if it were a man , begging an answer out of it . The concerted movements of the maidens are much like those of a Greek women 's chorus , say , in Euripides ' Bacchae . As they advance and retire and go circling around the idol they cry out along with NOTINA. ) p. 32 NOTINA AND MAIDS Iti ! Iti ! ( God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against its wooden belly . Now she kneels and stretches out her arms . But the creature remains mute and staring-faced as before . The movements of the maidens tighten in their muscular intensity . ITUFA springs up and lets out another of his fearful yells . ) ITUFA Yie  --  eh  --  eh  --  ay ! ( He begins dancing back and forth behind the idol , making a great pother with his gourds . NOTINA and the MAIDS break into a high pleading song accompanied by the unseen drum and flutes . ) NOTINA AND MAIDS Iti itinica numana , orobo mucibine ituhu , Koso holota chale iquila Notina hubua , Hibuaso inihi aquita.Tuma betale ! Father , our Father in the sky , dry our tears , we pray thee , And send a mighty warrior to our Notina who is pining for love , One who will cherish this lovely maid and make her his wedded wife . For the tenth time we beg thee ! ( The boom of a cannon is heard off at the far Left rear . A second boom is heard nearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Menendez ' ship is seen approaching the shore , its masts and spars showing above the trees as it slides slowly and almost dream-like along . The hull of the ship is not seen , being screened by the lower trees and underbrush on shore . The ship 's Spanish pennants and colors are flying gaily in the breeze . ITUFA rushes over to the Left and stares off at it , his gourds raised high in the air . The masts of the ship are seen stopping . The MAIDS cluster , frightened , around NOTINA . They pull at her , telling her they believe their god is angry at them and is sending evil on them. ) p. 33 MAIDS Iti yuri ! NOTINA ( Telling them it can not be true . ) Iti yuri-te ! ITUFA ( Yelling . ) Hiti nayo ! ( It is the white devils . ) ( He runs back and begins to tug at the idol . The MAIDENS help him . NOTINA stands gazing off toward the ship . The idol is now lifted from the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Purucusta ! Purucusta ! ( They bear the idol , running off to the Right . NOTINA follows , walking swiftly but looking back as she goes . The scene is empty for a moment , then off at the Left front the beating of a snare drum is heard . CAPTAIN ALBAREZ and a few of his SOLDIERS appear over the rise and stand on the hillock looking around . A trumpeter and a drummer are with them . The LIGHT on the masts of the ships at the Left rear fades out . In the darkness they are lowered out of sight . ) CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ ( Pointing down to the Center Stage . ) That clearing looks like a fitting place . Sound the trumpet . Let the governor hear . ( The TRUMPETER sounds a call , accompanied by a roll of the snare drum . Presently in the forest off at the Left an answering trumpet is heard and then the loud voice of MENENDEZ. ) p. 34 VOICE OF MENENDEZ Halloo ! Halloo ! ( Albarez and his men come across the Center Stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared when three Indian hunters with bows and arrows and no game come hurrying over the Left hillock . They have been frightened from their hunt by the sound of the trumpet and cannon and are glancing apprehensively off as they trot along . They quicken their trot into a run , on down across the forestage and up and over the Right hillock out of sight . The follow SPOTLIGHT has accompanied them as they ran . It now fades out , leaving the Center Stage illuminated as before . Far away at the Right front the great Indian DRUM sounds a few loud beats again , above which rises a burst of Indian yells . Then the sounds die out . Off at the Left Center voices are heard raised in a religious chant . A colorful religious procession enters at the Left , led by FATHER LOPEZ in his proper liturgicals . By his side walks BROTHER DOMINGO holding aloft a slender white cross some ten feet tall . Immediately behind them come two flagbearers with the flags of Castile and Aragon . These bearers are BARTOLOME ARVIDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 23 , swarthy , heavy-set and grim-visaged . Then next comes MENENDEZ with a pennanted lance in his hand and with him JULIO HERNANDEZ , a strong , tall-framed soldier of some 25 or 30 , bearing forward the great drooping crimson personal flag of MENENDEZ as Captain-General of the Ocean Seas and Adelantado of Florida . Closely following them come DIEGO DE MONTES , 35 , the Quartemaster ; DON PEDRO DE VALDES , 30 , the Campmaster ; CAPTAIN MARTIN DE OCHOA , 25 ; DR . MANUEL MERCADO , 40 , a surgeon ; and GONZALO DE SOLIS DE MERAS , 35 , brother-in-law to MENENDEZ and the clerk and recorder for the colony . Next comes CAPTAIN ALBAREZ with his armed men , then a number of well-dressed colonist men and women and three or four children , and last a few sailors . EVA GONZALES and BARBARA AZEDO are among the women . A number of the people carry colorful flags , banners , gonfalons , and a few embroidered family coats-of-arms held proudly up. ) p. 35 PEOPLE ( Chanting joyfully . ) Te @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veneratur.Tibi omnes Angeli  --  tibi coeli et universae Potestates:Tibi Cherubim et Seraphim incessabili voce proclamant  --  Sanctus  --  Sanctus  --  Dominus Deus Sabaoth . ( The people sound forth their words with fervency and deep emotion . The procession circles the scene , and then the head of it stops at the Right Center rear . DOMINGO waits to set up the cross . As the music continues , GREGORIO LARA , a plump , bearded workman of 40 or so and wearing a sort of skull cap , comes forward with a spade to prepare a hole for setting the cross . FATHER LOPEZ jubilantly discovers that a place already is miraculously provided . He points to it as a happy omen , clasps his hands and raises his eyes thankfully to heaven . The cross is now planted in the hole where the Indian god had formerly stood . GREGORIO pantomimes the tamping of the dirt around it with the handle of his spade .

Old Itufa dashes into the edge of the scene with his gourds , letting out his screech as he comes . ) ITUFA Yie  --  eh  --  eh  --  ay ! ( Several of the women scream and huddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind Itufa with his retinue . ) BASILIO BONITO ( Fearfully . ) ' T is my master the great cacique Oriba . Save me from him , people , save me ! ( He moves behind Sara , and she plants her plump figure protectingly in front of him . Oriba advances further into the scene . Itufa begins placating the air ahead of him with his shaking gourds . The cacique stops , and his followers stop with him , Notina and her Maids lagging somewhat in the rear behind the few braves . Oriba 's manner is regal and fearless . Itufa keeps shaking his gourds . The cacique gestures commandingly to him . ) ORIBA Hani ! ( Stop . ) ( The gourds are silent . Menendez steps out to meet Oriba and extends his hand . The chief looks at him , scratches his great naked chest with his free hand , slaps his wide flat belly and laughs harshly . Father Lopez comes forward and sprinkles the ground with holy water . Itufa shakes his gourds over the place where the drops have fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Itufa  --  hani ! ( Itufa , stop it . ) ( The old shaman turns sullenly away and holds his gourds to him in silence. ) p. 43 PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES We are friends ! Friends ! ORIBA ( Coldly . ) Pouhisse-te . ( No friend . ) Cha chi mueno ? ( Who are you ? ) BASILIO BONITO ( Interpreting from behind Sara 's back . ) He asks who are you , sir . He knows some of our speech . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Lifting his lance . ) I am Pedro Menendez de Aviles , a Spaniard  --  ( Hernandez lifts the personal banner high at these words. ) and I am come to be a brother to your people . ORIBA ( Shaking his head . ) Na niha . Not my brother . ( Basilio comes a bit from behind Sara and speaks to the chief . ) BASILIO BONITO ( Indicating Menendez . ) Adelantando  --  ano paracusi olato ico . ( Oriba stares at Menendez and then bursts into a volley of derisive laughter , bending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . Itufa gestures to the other Indians to join respectfully in with their master 's laughter , and they do so .

( What . ) You speak what ? BASILIO BONITO ( Nodding . ) Ano paracusi olato ico ibine . A mighty warrior . ( He makes a sweeping gesture indicating that Menendez has come from beyond the sea . ) Speak to her , your honor . From my poor companions and me she has learned much of our speech . She is a princess . Her name is Notina . NOTINA ( Nodding . ) O motala  --  yes . This my brother , na niha , the great cacique Oriba .

Menendez bows to her . ) ORIBA ( To Menendez , indicating Notina . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My Notina is a beautiful young woman , yes , I do say so . ) I love her , my sister .

Thus do I prove the honesty of my words to him . ( He hands the sword to Oriba , who takes it in surprise . He handles it warily , obviously suspicious of some trickery . ) BASILIO BONITO ( With a joyful squeal . ) I am free ! Free ! And oh , darling Sara , when I am washed and clothed again !  --  ( He shivers with delight , and his feet start cutting up once more .

BASILIO BONITO ( Chuckling . ) Already she esteems you , sir . ( As Oriba and his people disappear , the unseen DRUM beats a flurry of sound again and is silent . The soldiers relax their at-the-ready attitude . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Lifting his lance , his voice strong and authoritative . ) Men , women , children , my beloved ones  --  blessed be God on high , we have now arrived at our new haven and our home .

PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Calling out loudly . ) And now we needs must strengthen our settlement at once lest the French pirates come to attack us helpless . And to the mercy of God we commend us . Now every man to his task ! Unload the ship ! CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ Unload the ship ! See to the poor suffering cattle at once ! VOICES Unload the ship ! ( The people , including Father Lopez , Basilio and Sara , begin hurrying off at the Left . ) CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ ( To Juan Rivas , his alert non-commissioned officer . ) Set the guard , Juan Rivas .

Baldez is 19 and Cruz 24. ) p. 49 PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Let my captains gather here . ( He moves over to the Left front . Here Albarez , Meras , Ochoa , Valdes , Montes and Mercado gather around him . ) Ye marked the attitude of the cacique Oriba . He will get news soon to the French heretics that we have arrived and have started our city . Our best defense lies in surprise , does it not ? What think ye of our marching at once on this Fort Caroline ?

The light remains on Menendez and his group . ) GONZALO SELIS MERAS Why not unload our ship and move up the coast by sea ? PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Because the delay would be several days . Our chance is in surprise . Captain Ochoa ? p. 50 CAPTAIN MARTIN DE OCHOA ( Thin-faced and intense . ) I am ready to follow you , sir . But the march through the jungle will be fearful hard this season of the year . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Captain Albarez ? CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ That is where we can win , my General . Because it is so difficult to march by land the French will not consider we will do it . They will be expecting us from the sea . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES To sit here and wait for the pirates to attack is to invite an end to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces  --  half shall go with me and Captain Ochoa , the other remain here under you , Captain Albarez . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ ( In dismay . ) But , Your Excellency  --  PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES I shall miss my right-hand man , but I must know that the building of our settlement goes on with all speed and under your direction . If matters should go wrong with me  --  then your good hands remain . ( Back to the others . ) Your vote . Shall we attack the French at once ? VOICES ( Though some are not too eager . ) Yes , at once ! PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES We should be ready to march at daybreak . Away ! ( He starts rapidly off at the Left , and then breaks into a run. ) p. 51 DR . MANUEL MERCADO See him run ! As surgeon I have warned him against fractures . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ ( Sharply . ) He has to run because so many of his followers walk . ( He too breaks into a run and dashes off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The others move more slowly off . The scene fades out . In the distance shouts are heard from the unloading ship ,  --  " Stand away ! " , " Heave together ! " , mixed with the mooing of cattle , bleating of sheep , cackling of poultry in the sound track , etc . The sounds die down , and the Menendez marching music comes in and continues softly as a background . BASILIO as narrator enters at the Left front of the Center Stage . He is dressed in his good peasant clothes again . The light brightens on him there . ) BASILIO BONITO ( In a strong business-like voice . ) With all speed Menendez and his men marched against the invaders . Cutting and hacking their way through the jungle of thorn and saw grass , of hammocks and salt marshes , sometimes up to their necks in icy water , they reached the French fort at dawn on the fourth day . They surprised and captured the place without the loss of a man . The wily Jean Ribaut had already sailed away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Augustine . But a storm shipwrecked him and he and his soldiers landed ashore some eighteen miles south of here . Pedro Menendez  --  with Brother Domingo along for spiritual comfort  --  hurried to oppose him , and there on the night of October 28 he and his men faced the Frenchmen across a dividing river . ( The LIGHT fades out . A staccato series of rhythmic husky grunts is heard in the darkness over on the Left side-hillock , mixed in with a single person 's hand clapping and the beat of a pair of dancing feet against the earth . The LIGHT comes up there. ) p. 52 p. 53 Act 1 , Scene 4 SCENE 4 Brother Domingo , the Indian cleric , is shown behaving strangely on top of the hillock  --  clapping his hands and dancing a sort of jig , his monastic robe flapping about his bouncing legs .

Tonight call me so . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Nay and I will not . ( Sternly . ) You are here to listen for sounds of the French across the river with your Indian ears , and this behavior  --  BROTHER DOMINGO DE FLORIDA They are here . I have heard them . p. 54 PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES This strange behavior of yours of late I understand not . BROTHER DOMINGO DE FLORIDA I tell you now , my lord .

( Stretching out his arms . ) Ah , this blessed beautiful Florida , my land , tonight I feel my land , I taste it  --  ( Loudly. ) my home ! See the moon , the water silver shining . Here on this river my brother and I  --  together we would swim , here we paddled our canoe , we fished , we laughed , sang , drank in the sweet smells of the earth and the waters . ( Lifting his face . ) I thank thee , O Father ! ( Turning his face . ) I thank thee , thou Great Spirit that lives in the sun and guides the stars on high  --  thou hast brought me back to my homeland !

You are troubled . BROTHER DOMINGO DE FLORIDA ( His mood changing almost instantly . ) I remember I have no brother . The Spaniards killed him . Basilio saw it in the fighting . My father and mother are gone into the dark ground . Sharp grievings for me lost at sea , grievings for my brother , like red ants ate up their hearts . In my language we say , " Taca no timutema "  --  their fire is gone out . They are dead . ( He bows his head . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Putting his hand consolingly on his shoulder . ) I know .

( From beyond the river , the river being represented by the audience part of the amphitheatre , a voice presently answers. ) p. 56 VOICE Halloo ! PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Speak to them , Domingo . BROTHER DOMINGO DE FLORIDA ( Calling . ) Qui etes vous ? VOICE ( Answering back with some accent . ) Who are you ? PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Shouting . ) Show yourselves ! ( A number of Menendez ' men now scramble up on the bank behind him  --  among them CAPTAIN OCHOA , HERNANDEZ with the personal flag of the Governor , AVIDA with the flag of Castile , and ECIJA with a huge French flag which had been captured at the fall of Fort Caroline . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are here ! VOICES I am Jean Ribaut , Viceroy and Captain-General , holding this land for the King of France , its rightful owner . Who art thou ? ( The LIGHT comes up on the opposite bank and shows JEAN RIBAUT and three or four of his soldiers standing there . They are without armor but are armed . RIBAUT is bareheaded . He is about forty-five years old . One of the men holds a tattered and water-stained Huguenot flag . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Lifting his lance high , as HERNANDEZ raises his flag likewise . ) I am Don Pedro Menendez de Aviles , Captain-General of the western seas and Adelantado of Florida , come to colonize and defend this land for its rightful owner , Philip the Second of Spain . ( HERNANDEZ waves his flag . OVIDIO GONZALES , 18 , an armed guard , brings in CLAUDE PELLICIER from the shadows at the Left . PELLICIER is a Huguenot prisoner captured at Fort Caroline .

PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Fort Caroline is no more . It is now Fort San Mateo , captured on Saint Matthew 's day and so named . The flags of Spain fly over it . ( A babble of voices breaks out among Ribaut 's men in the sound track . ) VOICES Non ! Non ! Pas possible ! Incroyable ! PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES You were on the seas with your ships headed to destroy our newborn city of Saint Augustine , and God answered our prayers . He sent a storm to blow ye from your course . Then we marched overland and took the fort . JEAN RIBAUT ( Calling again after a pause . ) You would seek to entrap us . You have not touched Fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ECIJA , who comes forward with the French flag .

There we took it . p. 58 JEAN RIBAUT One could come by such a flag by chance . ( MENENDEZ reaches down and pulls the prisoner CLAUDE PELLICIER to his feet . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Sternly . ) Speak ! CLAUDE PELLICIER ( Almost sobbing out his words . ) Je suis Claude Pellicier , mon General ! Helas , helas , c'est vrai ! Nos camarades sont tues et les femmes et les enfants raptes . ( A groan bursts from RIBAUT and his men in the sound track . ) JEAN RIBAUT ( Finally , broken and despairing . ) And the prisoners , the women , the children ? PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Are all sent to the Indies to be returned home . Surrender yourselves now and I shall do with ye as God requires . JEAN RIBAUT Nay , we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river in peace . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Excitedly to OCHOA . ) Mark ye ! No doubt Ribaut has already sent to his friend Oriba for canoes . If he gets across this river and joins his forces with the hundreds of warriors of the cacique he will descend on Saint Augustine and put us all to the sword , even as his French brethren once did the helpless women and children of Havana . p. 59 CAPTAIN MARTIN DE OCHOA True , true . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES We must see that no canoes come down the river . Captain Ochoa , double the number of your men there . Hurry ! CAPTAIN MARTIN DE OCHOA Very well , sir .

JEAN RIBAUT ( As the harmony dies down . ) ' T is the Great Martin Luther 's hymn  --  " A God of power is our God , He is our protector .

And thus they bring unto me a duty bitter as death again . ( Holding out his hands , his face lifted . ) Let these hands be not bloody , even so , our Father .

CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ I crave no sleep this night . I keep watch . ( Menendez takes off his cape and spreads it on the ground for sleeping . ALBAREZ turns to assist him . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Music , music ! ( PELLICIER sits and begins playing a sweet haunting melody on his flute . ALBAREZ moves farther along the hillock among the trees and stands on watch , his sword in his hand . MENENDEZ calls out to PELLICIER . ) A good tone , Frenchman , a most sweet and touching tone .

The music and the song go on . ) Avant d'aller plus loin , &nbsp; &nbsp; Avant que partir , Je veux ici garder &nbsp; &nbsp; La porte de ma mie . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( As he stamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth through which such heavenly music pours will be full of blood .

For such it must be . ( Albarez stanrh looking down at his commander . He takes off his cape and spreads it over him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ma mie , a douce mie " song , and the scene fades out . A medley of hammering and sawing and women 's voices singing is heard from the Center Stage . The LIGHT comes up there. ) p. 64 Act 1 , Scene 5 SCENE 5 The settlement at St. Augustine as it is built and is a-building . A great deal of construction has already been accomplished , and a pother of labor is still going on in and around the fort . A well has been dug over at the extreme Left front and is fitted with a cross-logged curbing about waist high and a sweep-pole and wooden bucket . During this and some of the following scenes , people from time to time come to the well to go through the pantomime of filling their basins or pots . The women find it a good place to gossip . Farther back and to the Left is a little cabin . We see into it as if the front wall were off . It is furnished with a rude bed and table and a rather large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the governor 's sleeping and working quarters , and when he is at the settlement his personal flag flies from a ten-foot flagpole at the front of it . Showing above and behind the cabin is an angle of palisades marking one corner of the off-scene fort . Over on the inside of the palisades and unseen . by us is a walkway , along which the sentinel paces his watch , his figure showing well above the serrated and pointed tops of the upright timbers . At the Center back and pretty much filling the former open space which showed to the woods beyond is the facade of the newly-erected mission house or chapel . Between the chapel and the palisades is a flagpole about thirty feet high from which flies the banner of Spain . To the Right of the chapel a huge rough-hewed cross some twenty or more feet in height broods over the scene . And between the cross and the chapel are two upright log posts with a crosspiece above from which two mission bells are suspended . At the Right and opposite the governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a sort of court of guard headquarters for Menendez ' personal guard . We see into it also as if the front wall were off . It is fitted with a heavy crude table and at the rear end with a wide plank-shelf bed layout sufficient for five or six men to sleep alongside of one another . When the LIGHT comes up on . the scene , a number of people are busy working away . FATHER LOPEZ on the upper level is looking after the finishing touches to the outside of his chapel . Two young men , BLAS AZEDO , 19 , brother to Barbara Azedo , and MIGUEL DE BALDEZ are completing the fastening of the bells to the timber crosspiece . FATHER LOPEZ brings a length of small rope to attach to the bell arm for ringing . CONRADO CID , 27 , and JUAN DE LA CRUZ , 24 , are completing the nailing of the eight-foot cross that surmounts the front gable of the building . On top of the roof beyond them are two other young men , OVIDIO GONZALES and TADEO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are joined crosswise and tied with rope , then stretched downward to be tied at the eaves by two other young men  --  DOMINGO GUITERREZ , 22 , and EDUARDO MARTINEZ , 26  --  this to keep the palmetto frond covering from being blown away by the wind . On the palisade walkway up high at the Left rear GREGORIO LARA paces his guard duty , his musket on his shoulder . But the center of main interest in this scene is a group of some seven or eight colonist women who are seated about the middle Stage area working rapidly away on their diminishing supply of palmetto fronds  --  trimming , cutting and tieing them and passing them on for thatching the buildings , their actions pretty much all in pantomime . In the group are EVA GONZALES , BARBARA AZEDO  --  both of plainer dress than when we saw them in the Royal Palace in Madrid  --  ADELA LARA , 37 , wife of Gregorio Lara , ISABEL , 15 , and EMIUA , 16 , their daughters ; LOUISA CID , 25 , wife of Conrado Cid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Three children are helping  --  busily handing on the separate fronds for the trimming and tieing . They are DIEGO CID , 5 , son of Conrado and Louisa Cid ; ASCENSION , 9 , and CECILIA DE VEGA , 11 , son and daughter of Ricardo and Catalina de Vega . The women are singing away as they work , led by EVA GONZALES ' clear lyric soprano , with BARBARA AZEDO 'S rich contralto abetting , and the theatre music accompanying . WOMEN &nbsp; &nbsp; Come along , ye lazy mopers , &nbsp; &nbsp; Work away , ye drowsy topers , For the setting sun is soon descended , And the work that 's lost is ended . &nbsp; &nbsp; Hark , soon we 'll hear &nbsp; &nbsp; Loud and clear &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The voices singing , &nbsp; &nbsp; Gay tamborets , &nbsp; &nbsp; Castanets &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And footfalls ringing ! ( As the women sing , the , different workers here and there enter into the spirit and rhythm of the song , some of them whistling along with it , others singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of choreographed action. ) p. 65 WORKMEN ( Echoing . ) Gay tamborets , Castanets , &nbsp; &nbsp; And footfalls ringing . ( The sentinel marches back and forth in rhythm , and the hammering goes rap-rap the same . As the singing continues , the high spirits and exuberance of the song build up . ) &nbsp; &nbsp; In the woods the winds are sighing , &nbsp; &nbsp; Autumn flowers are pale and dying , But our hearts are warm , and heaven smilingSpeeds along our work beguiling . &nbsp; &nbsp; Hark , soon we 'll hear &nbsp; &nbsp; Loud and clear &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The voices singing MEN ( Echoing . ) Hark , soon we 'll hearLoud and clear &nbsp; &nbsp; The voices singing  --  ALL Gay tamboretsCastanets &nbsp; &nbsp; And footfalls ringing ! ( The supply of fronds is exhausted now , and the women begin to jiggle and shift where they are . Suddenly the theatre music starts up in the work song in quickened tempo , and EVA and BARBARA spring out into the scene and begin to dance . The men cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbara ! Ole ! Aye ! ( Others from the women 's group join in , and in no time at all a dance is under way . Some of the men jump away from their jobs and take part . FATHER LOPEZ stands on the upper level beaming his satisfaction at them . And then his hand goes out , takes hold of the BELL CLAPPER and starts a regular stroke  --  bong and then bong and then bong again  --  emphasizing the beat in the dance . Some of the men rap with their hammers , others with pieces of slats or boards in a percussive accompaniment . SARA SOLANO , now BONITO , comes in at the Left front carrying an empty wooden bucket in her hand . She sets the bucket down and tears over to the group and begins dancing wildly , her big breasts bouncing under her dress . The dance grows more furious . CAPTAIN ALBAREZ comes striding in at the Right with three or four of his soldiers . He calls loudly through the air. ) p. 66 CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ Halt ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women he calls out loudly . ) Halt ! ( The dance slows down , then stops . He speaks to his men . ) Report to the campmaster Valdes inside the fort at once . March ! ( They march off at the Left . ALBAREZ turns toward the group , his voice trembling with irritation . ) You have orders to work  --  not dance . ( The men turn away from the girls . ) BARBARA AZEDO We were waiting for Basilio to fetch us a supply of palmetto leaves , Captain Albarez . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ And Dona Sara , wherefore the empty bucket ? It is past time to milk the cows . SARA SOLANO ( Sweetly . ) So it be , my dear Captain . But you have to get hold of the cows ' tits to draw milk , do n't you ? And if you ca n't find the cows how can you lay hand on their tits ? CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ And where are the cows ? SARA SOLANO Down in the reed thicket . I followed the bell till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so beat about they were on the long ocean voyage and hungry , I fear they have fled away to the Indians . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ Then I will send men to bring them back . What of your soap-making ? p. 67 SARA SOLANO I am waiting for the ashes to cool , sir . BARBARA AZEDO Do n't be angry with us , Captain Albarez . We do work hard . We do . FATHER LOPEZ My son , it is I who have encouraged them in their good spirits , lest they fall to empty grieving for the Governor 's absence . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ ( Colorlessly , almost coldly . ) Yes , Father . ( He moves about the scene inspecting things , EVA 'S eyes following him . As he walks over to the Left to take a look at the Governor 's cabin , she goes up to him . ) EVA GONZALES Why are you so unhappy , Jose ? CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ ( The words almost hissing from him . ) And why did you come here ? Why ? ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks after him an instant , then turns back to fastening his rope to the bell . EVA returns slowly to the other women . From the Right comes the voice of BASILIO raised in a harsh command . ) BASILIO 'S VOICE Pest on ye ! Move along ! EVA GONZALES ( Now taking charge of things once more . ) Welcome home again , Basilio . ( She and the others hurry to meet him as he comes driving a slothful donkey in , loaded with a great bundle of palmetto fronds . He is walking spraddle-legged and with his curved arms lifted . A guitar is strapped on his back. ) p. 68 SARA SOLANO ( Tenderly . ) I was beginning to worry after you , dear husband . BASILIO BONITO This varmint of laziness is slow  --  slow ! ( He and the women begin to unload the fronds . ) BARBARA AZEDO ( Lightly and pickingly , for in the new world she has become freer and more talkative . ) Out serenading the birds and trees again with that guitar , Basilio ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BASILIO BONITO And what a fish-hook for a tongue have ye , Barbara Azedo ? And me all married to my Sara and she snug at night like a gentle dove cooing in my bosom . SARA SOLANO ( To BARBARA . ) Ah-hah ! BARBARA AZEDO ( Tossing her head . ) La , la . And why do you hold your arms so ? BASILIO BONITO Because I am galled to iniquity. by these cruel clothes . My armpits are but a Hebrew furnace , and as for certain other parts of my consecrated flesh  --  ( Shuddering. ) uh-uh . SARA SOLANO I have more of the good gum ointment I 've prepared to ease you , my love . BASILIO BONITO Still , as the scripture says , a man 's nakedness must be clothed lest he be a shame to earth and heaven . And whatever the pain and price to go civilized I gladly pay it for the feel of my Sara 's soft  --  er  --  um  --  hands . p. 69 SARA SOLANO ( To BARBARA . ) And could your new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such honey-sweet words ? BARBARA AZEDO ( With a flirt of her head . ) La , la . ( The fronds are being distributed now for processing . BASILIO suddenly lets out a yell and thrashes about the scene holding his hand to his rump . ) BASILIO BONITO Oooh  --  ooh , he bit me ! ( He turns and draws back his fist as if to hit the donkey on the head , then decides not to . ) Was there ever such a stubborn borrico in the wide world as this Columbus ! EVA GONZALES Columbus ! BASILIO BONITO Aye , named for that other Columbus that first discovered this heathen land some seventy-odd years agone . Stubborn he was  --  stubborn  --  and him a-sailing week after week and all his men , my granddaddy among ' em , afeared in the dark night they 'd drop over the edge of the flat world into the bottomless pit below . Oh ! Oh ! ( The donkey Columbus lets loose a terrific whickering mocking bray in the sound track . The people laugh merrily . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mocking his master . ( Basilio aims a kick at Columbus. ) p. 70 FATHER LOPEZ Nay , Basilio , remember , it was on just such our Savior once rode . BASILIO BONITO ( Humbly . ) True , true , Father , and sore put to it the Savior must have been for a means to travel . ( He leads Columbus on , SARA going with him to treat his sufferings with her ointment , her arm around him . She picks up her milk bucket as they go out at the Left . A gun is fired off at the Left front , followed by the sound of a trumpet . GREGORIO , upon the rampart , lets out a high cry . ) GREGORIO The Governor ! The Governor ! ( The scene instantly turns into loud jubilation . ) VOICES Thank God , thank God ! ( The men gaze off to the Left , and some of the women run up to the rear platforms the better to see . A number of other colonists run in from the Right and join them there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FATHER LOPEZ hurries into the chapel . AZEDO begins ringing the BELL loudly . The sound of a marching DRUM now comes nearer at the Left . FATHER LOPEZ reappears from the chapel wearing a stole and carrying a cross some two feet high . He begins a chant , and all join in as they start moving to the Left , quickly forming a sort of welcoming procession . EVA , BARBARA and several of the group are now waving palmetto branches. ) p. 71 FATHER LOPEZ AND THE PEOPLE Cantate Domino canticum novum  --  Alleluia ! Quia mirabilia fecit Dominus-Alleluia ! Ante conspectum gentium , Revelavit justitiam suam  --  Alleluia ! Alleluia ! ( The procession meets MENENDEZ coming in with a few of his advance guard , including CAPTAIN OCHOA , the surgeon MERCADO and his brother-in-law SOLIS DE MERAS . The jubilant ALBAREZ has hurried out and joined him also . The Governor is weather-beaten and worn and his men , those that we see , are in a state of exhaustion  --  muddy , sunblistered , and some tattered and torn . by the thorns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few of the women run forward with happy cries and embrace their husbands and loved ones . BARBARA AZEDO dashes out and happily hugs her sweetheart JUAN RIVAS . ) VOICES Bravo ! Viva ! The Governor ! The Governor ! ( The scene grows quiet as the people see the solemn and almost silent behavior of MENENDEZ and his men . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( His face working with emotion . ) My people  --  thanks be unto God that He has allowed your governor and the brave men with him to return safe home to Saint Augustine , the city ye have a-building so strong and fair . ( He looks solemnly about him . ) The French pirates are destroyed . Jean Ribaut is dead ! p. 72 CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ ( Loudly . ) Cheers ! Cheers ! ( He waves his sword in the air . ) VOICES Viva ! Viva ! Cheers ! Cheers ! ( Menendez puts out his hand . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES In death itself there is little to cheer . ( Almost brokenly as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands together . ) With the blessed water , Father Lopez , let these hands be made clean . ( He rises , runs forward to the big cross over at the Right and drops down before it for a moment . CAPTAIN OCHOA and several others of his weary men do likewise . MENENDEZ rises , the men around him rising also . EVA turns and goes off at the Left . FATHER LOPEZ fetches holy water . MENENDEZ pantomimically laves his hands in it as if they themselves were dying of thirst . ) FATHER LOPEZ Benedicimus te . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Quietly . ) Now to your quarters , my beloved ones , each to give thanks and ponder the bountiful goodness of our Lord . ( The people move away . MENENDEZ turns toward the little cabin . He sinks down on a rough bench in front of it . ALBAREZ and FATHER LOPEZ remain in the scene with him. ) p. 73 CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ You must rest  --  here in the cabin we have built for you . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capitan . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ ( With pride . ) I have driven the people hard in. their work , Your Excellency . FATHER LOPEZ What of Brother Domingo ? I see him not . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES He is away to visit his people . Already he is taking the gospel to the Indians . FATHER LOPEZ ' T is well , I trust . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Amen . ( To ALBAREZ . ) And now I needs must prepare a report of the great news for His Majesty . I  --  ( He staggers to his feet , helping himself erect by the aid of his lance . FATHER LOPEZ goes off toward the fort at the Left . ) CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ Nay , Your Honor , first you must rest . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Staring ahead of him . ) Jean Ribaut , when he knew he must die , asked leave to address his soul to God . He knelt there in the wide sands where the cactus grows and prayed . He asked forgiveness for me , Pedro Menendez , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . Alas , that his anguished ghost must ever turn in the tormenting fires of hell . I would I might pray for him . p. 74 CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ Then do , my Captain . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Nay ! it is forbade to pray for heretics . ( He shakes his head . ) Now to report to the King . ( He turns , staggers and is about to fall . ALBAREZ grasps his arm to help him . ) CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ ( Alarmed . ) You are ill , sir . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Chuckling harshly . ) It 's the cursed mire of the swamps or seashore sand seeming to give way beneath my feet again . I feel myself walking , walking , my feet and legs asleep and dreaming the while , sinking , sinking . ( He drops down on the bench . ALBAREZ goes to the little table in the cabin . ) CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ I will write for you . ( He pantomimes reaching for writing materials . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Dictatingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain  --  " ( ALBAREZ pantomimes writing . ) " Your gracious Majesty  --  Glorious news I send . First , we have founded our city and named it Saint Augustine . The fort and many of the houses are nearing completion . Second , the settlement of French pirates and heretics has been destroyed . Now we begin the next  --  begin the next task  --  " ( His head droops over as he nods . ALBAREZ waits . EVA comes in at the Right with a large mug of wine and some bread . ALBAREZ looks out and sees her. ) p. 75 CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ ( In his tense voice . ) The Governor is busy now disturb him not . EVA GONZALES ( Ignoring him . ) Your Excellency , some bread and wine . ( Menendez looks up . She goes forward and with a curtsy proffers him the wine and bread . He reaches for it eagerly . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES I had forgot all needs of the body . ( Taking a deep draught from the mug . ) Ah  --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ALBAREZ , who has stood up as EVA came forward , still remains standing , staring ahead of him . ) EVA GONZALES God bless you , sir . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES And you , Senorita Gonzales . ( She turns and goes over to the Right front in the shadows and stands looking out at the night . MENENDEZ drinks again . ) Tell me , Captain Albarez , what is the fairest work of God 's wide fruitful hands ? ( He waits . ALBAREZ says nothing . ) Well , I 'll tell you  --  a beautiful woman . ( Gesturing with his bread-filled hand . ) And she is beautiful . Think you not so ? CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ There are certain caballeros in Madrid who used to say so , sir . ( Reading from dictation . ) " Now we begin our next  --  " p. 76 PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Taking another draught from the mug . ) His Majesty may wait while we talk of the beauty of a woman . It is a subject he too knows much about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Loudly as ALBAREZ makes no answer . ) Do you love Eva Gonzales ? CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ Don Pedro , sir  --  ( He bows his head over . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES You were childhood playmates , were you not ? CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ Yes . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES She loves you . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ ( With sudden vehemence . ) Nay , I can not say more . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES There in Madrid the sycophants and fools were ever hatching the nit of gossip and scandal into listening ears . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ Scandal ! Aye . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES What of it ? Here Senorita Gonzales is proving herself  --  proving the stout heart and excellent woman 's soul in her . All the women look to her . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ And the men ? p. 77 PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Let them look . God made her to be looked at . She is beautiful . ( He waves his mug and drains it . ) Well , we shall see , we shall see . ( He shakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ Rest-rest  --  ( Indicating the letter . ) His Majesty can wait on this too while you sleep . Tomorrow  --  PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Weary-weary  --  If only I could sleep . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ You can . ( He rises , comes over and assists MENENDEZ into the cabin and to the rude rush bed . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Music , let me have music ! CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ ( Calling off . ) Ho-music ! Basilio ! PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES When I close my eyes-ah  --  the rages and sheets of flame ! ( He sprawls himself down on the bed . ALBAREZ lifts off his cape and spreads it over the governor and stands gazing down at him a moment , then comes out of the cabin . He sees EVA and stops as she turns to him . The LIGHT brightens on them a bit. ) p. 78 EVA GONZALES I heard what he said to you . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ ( Abruptly . ) And what I said to him ? EVA GONZALES Yes . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I have . ( Vehemently . ) But my feeling for you has not changed . ( Suddenly . ) Those days of our childhood you ca n't forget . You remember the little doll house you built for me and the tiny doors that went in and out ? You wanted always to be a builder  --  an architect . ( Accusingly . ) You changed and became a soldier . JOSE ( Angrily . ) And why not become a soldier ? EVA GONZALES ( Passionately . ) Here in the fresh new world we must forget whatever was wrong in the old . We must , Jose , we should ! JOSE ( Roughly . ) If we can forget ! ( He turns suddenly away to the rear and calls off . ) Ho , Basilio , let us have music for the Governor 's resting . ( He hurries away at the Right . EVA goes slowly out at the Left . The LIGHT dims down on the front of the Stage but remains concentrated on MENENDEZ where he lies in his cabin . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variation of the old French folksong we had heard earlier , accompanied by a guitar . Presently the harmonious humming of the unseen chorus joins in , and the LIGHT irises in on MENENDEZ . The music and humming continue their easeful legato for a while , and then suddenly it all separates into a splaying discord . The discord holds , and the music goes on in a high and shimmering dissonance . In the darkness the scrim panel has been slid in and raised up beyond the high platform at the rear as before , and here a blue LIGHT fades in , wavering at first and then holding steady . Beyond the scrim and in the light the configurations of MENENDEZ ' dreaming start forming once more . The huge hoarse rasping whisper of RIBAUT 'S voice is heard pervading the amphitheatre with an echo-chamber and other-world effect , calling queerly and commandingly in its foreign accent. ) p. 79 VOICE Pedro Menendez ! Pedro Menendez ! ( An answering groan is heard from the interior of Menendez ' cabin . It comes through the sound track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the rear now , seen through the scrim , staring out with the masked face of death , a great bloodstain spreading across his white shirt front down from his throat . His voice continues , as the strange unearthly music accompanies . ) Je suis mort ! J'accuse ! J'accuse ! ( Now behind RIBAUT other figures form , a half dozen or more , each with its own individual mask of death , and each with the spreading bloodstains across its bosom . All the figures now speak together in their outlandish whisper . ) FIGURES Nous accusons ! Nous accusons ! ( Almost like children in a round . ) Pedro Menendez  --  il est un assassin ! Pedro Menendez  --  il est un meutrier . Tue ! Tue ! Tue ! ( With a great windy sighing . ) Helas ! Helas ! ( From the cabin MENENDEZ ' voice bursts out . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Through the sound track as before . ) I asked ye to repent and acknowledge the true God , and ye would have been spared . VOICES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inquisitors ! Murderer , murderer ! Ours is the everlasting and one God ! ( Quotingly . ) " Thou shalt have no other God before me. " p. 80 PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Ragingly . ) God , God !  --  The true God  --  our God ! VOICES ( Likewise . ) God , God  --  The true God !  --  our God ! MENENDEZ and VOICES . ( Together in the sound track . ) God ! God ! God ! ( A yell as of pain is heard from the sleeping MENENDEZ now . The queer music ends and the phantoms vanish . ALBAREZ comes running in with a lantern . He hurries into the cabin . The LIGHT comes on wider there . MENENDEZ is sitting on the edge of the bed . ) CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ ( In alarm . ) Your Excellency ! PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Nay , lad , I dream so . ' T is no matter . Back to your rest now . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ I will watch . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Nay ! Good night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and lifts off the cross from the wall . He holds it to him and kisses it , and kneels by his bed , lifting it . ALBAREZ hesitates a moment and goes back the way he came . MENENDEZ begins to pray earnestly . ) Ad te levavi animam meam ! Deus meus , in te confido , non erubescam ! Neque irrideant me inimici mei , etenim universi , qui te expectant , non confundentur . ( While he is praying , the LIGHT goes down and out . There is a moment of silence and then the sound of girls ' laughter is heard in the darkness at the far Right front . The LIGHT comes up on the Right side-hillock in a short eye-blink scene . Here the young Indian people are welcoming DOMINGO ( SITO ) back home among his kinsmen . There are some half-dozen young girls and as many youths and one or two old people . He is being embraced by a number of them , and several are reaching out over the heads of others to touch him. ) p. 81 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss you . ) Ponala hibua yaye pouhisse ? ( Have you come to stay with your own people ? ) O mantela ! ( We hope so . ) ( But as glad as they are to see him , they also show that they are interested in his religious dress and amused by it . One or two of the lads pretend to lift the skirt of his cassock , calling out the while . ) YOUTHS Viro-nia ! Viro-nia ! ( He is a man-woman . ) Nia ! Nia ! ( Woman ! ) ( They all break into gales of laughter , and DOMINGO good naturedly enters into the fun of the occasion . The maidens now take hands and begin circling him in a dance , the young men and others clapping their hands in rhythm . They all start a rigmarole of vocables . ) VOICES Ee  --  ee  --  ee ! Ree  --  ree  --  ree ! Ho  --  ho  --  ho- ! Cha  --  cha  --  cha ! ( An unseen DRUM starts its percussive beat for the dance . It increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long DOMINGO himself feels the pull of the dance and begins to jiggle his body back and forth in the circle , his cassock flopping and flapping about his legs , and his rosary jogging up and down . He presently finds the garment in his way . Full of the spirit of the moment now , he loosens his cassock . The young girls pull at it , never stopping their flying movements . ORIBA comes into the scene from the rear and looks on , laughing and gesturing to those around him as much as to say  --  " See , our countryman has quit the white man and come back to his people . " ITUFA and NOTINA are with the chief. ) p. 82 ORIBA ( Roaring . ) Cha mantamala ! ( Who would want to be a Christian ! ) ( At this moment there is a shout off in the woods , and BUZZARD ONE-EYE comes rushing in . He runs up to ORIBA . ) APAHOLA Jean Ribaut , paracusi-te taca ni timutema ! ( Jean Ribaut is no longer a great warrior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ORIBA ( With a shout . ) Itufa numana !

( Your devil of a Pedro Menendez has killed them . ) BROTHER DOMINGO DE FLORIDA ( Looking at them . ) Pedro is not a devil . He is our good friend  --  good friend to all the Timucuans . NOTINA ( Calling to DOMINGO . ) And Pedro is the mighty warrior  --  not Jean Ribaut ! BROTHER DOMINGO DE FLORIDA True . ( One of the girls tries to make up to him lovingly , but he pushes her off . As if repenting of his former behavior , he turns ' and hurries out at the Right . All eyes are now turned to ORIBA. ) p. 83 ORIBA Ponala , naia kia , Pedro Menendez ano paracusi olato ico . ( Come , my children , Pedro Menendez is indeed a mighty king of kings . ) Pouhisse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I so declare it . ) ( He leads the way off into the shadows , ITUFA going behind and shaking his gourds angrily after him . The scene fades out . From the darkness of the Center Stage the ringing of the chapel BELL is heard . The LIGHT comes on there showing the colonists assembling in front of the chapel for vesper service . The Indian DRUM sounds off at the Right in interruption . The BELL stops . CAPTAIN ALBAREZ , CORPORAL RIVAS and his men hurry over to be on guard . DOMINGO enters from the Right . The people look fearfully in that direction . The DRUM dies . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Ah , Domingo . BROTHER DOMINGO DE FLORIDA My people are here to meet with you  --  with us  --  and they come in peace . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Thus was 1 hoping and praying . ( He hurries elatedly to the Right , meeting ORIBA coming in with a small retinue , including a few warriors , four servitors , ITUFA and two Indian men . One of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to it , signifying peace . ORIBA comes forward and puts out his hand . MENENDEZ grasps it warmly. ) p. 84 ORIBA Oriba yaye niha . ( Father Lopez comes down into the scene from the chapel . ) BROTHER DOMINGO DE FLORIDA He says he is now your brother . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES I understand . Pedro Menendez yaye niha Oriba . I am your brother . ORIBA Good ! Good ! ( He unbuckles the sword MENENDEZ had given him and hands it to him . MENENDEZ takes it . ) I give it back to you  --  my brother . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES I accept it , O my brother . ORIBA And your God  --  He will make my people strong  --  like you-strong ! Heh ? PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Yes , strong . FATHER LOPEZ Believe in Him and He will keep you safe . This cross will protect you .

The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) The cross  --  much power  --  ( He strokes it . ) FATHER LOPEZ Much power . ( Oriba gestures behind him , and the servitor brings forward the palmetto tuft . The chief bows and hands it to MENENDEZ. ) p. 85 ORIBA Now peace , my brother . ( MENENDEZ hands his sword on to BASILIO and jubilantly takes it . ORIBA calls off in his great voice . ) Heno ! Heno na niha ! , ( Bring the things to eat for my brother . ) ( The DRUM booms again , off-scene , and several Indian women led by BUZZARD ONE-EYE come in with gifts for MENENDEZ and the colonists  --  a basket of melons , three big fish hung from forked sticks stuck through their gills , a deer slung on a pole , a couple of wild turkeys and hares . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( His weathered face all wreathed in smiles . ) Corporal Rivas , take them to the cooks in the fort and tell them to prepare a feast at once . ( Rivas leads the Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EVA , BARBARA and SARA pantomime filling them with wine from jugs . ORIBA steps to the Right and beckons . ) ORIBA Ponala , kia ! ( Shrill Indian MUSIC breaks forth off-scene . Now PRINCESS NOTINA is brought in on a palanquin borne by four muscular Indian youths . She is accompanied by her maidens who are rhythmically waving their palmetto fronds in the air . ) MAIDENS ( In a sing-song unison as they come . ) La-la-la ! La-la-la ! ( NOTINA is beautiful in her flowered hair and feather-decorated dress . ORIBA proudly leads the palanquin over to MENENDEZ . It is lowered , and NOTINA steps gracefully out . She stands humbly before the Governor . ORIBA laughs happily. ) p. 86 ORIBA ( As the flute MUSIC stops . ) Much better gift I bring now to my brother , the mighty warrior Pedro Menendez . ( He takes NOTINA 'S hand and holds it out to MENENDEZ . ) You take . BROTHER DOMINGO DE FLORIDA ( With impassive countenance . ) The great chief , Your Excellency , in a treaty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( A little shock of reaction goes through the assembled people , but they remain waiting on MENENDEZ ' reply . The GOVERNOR is surprised , but he hides his feeling of embarrassment as well as he can and returns ORIBA 'S gaze with seemingly unperturbed dignity . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Yau honor your new brother too highly , O mighty Chief Oriba . ( He bows over NOTINA 'S hand with the air of any cavalier to a royal lady . She bends her head to one side in demure confusion . He looks over at FATHER LOPEZ . ) FATHER LOPEZ ( Coming forward . ) My daughter , we welcome you among us . Later we will talk of this matter . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Captain Albarez , see that gifts are distributed to our friends . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ ( Glancing at him . ) Very well , sir . ( Calling out to the Indians . ) We have trinkets , beads , some fans , bright cloth for you . A fan and mirror for the princess . Come . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EVA ushering NOTINA along the while . ORIBA and his people troop after them , the colonists following . MENENDEZ and FATHER LO- PEZ move over to the Left front . FATHER LOPEZ beckons to DOMINGO , who joins them . BASILIO looks back and sees the three and waits in the background listening . While this little conference is going on at the Left front , the light remains bright here , but goes down to half-dim on the Center Stage at the Right rear , where presently we see gifts being distributed to the happy Indians in the shadows there. ) p. 87 PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES What do you advise , Father ? FATHER LOPEZ You with a wife in Spain must not commit sin . You can declare our religion forbids it . BROTHER DOMINGO DE FLORIDA Don Hernando Cortes in Mexico married an Indian lady that the conquest and the Holy Church might prosper  --  even though he too had a wife in Spain . ( Basilio charges forward . ) BASILIO BONITO ( Almost frantically . ) Your honor , if you refuse her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will break out , and the bloodthirsty savages will destroy Saint Augustine , and I will be back in slavery again , and my dear Sara with me . Take the lady for a wife , sir ! Oh , do ! do ! ( He suddenly begins buckling the sword around MENENDEZ ' waist . ) BROTHER DOMINGO DE FLORIDA She is beautiful and good . No Christian is better  --  in here . ( He touches his breast  --  then abruptly . ) I have no advice . BASILIO BONITO If you take Notina for your wife , sir , that will prove to the Indians your love for them . Oh , sir , do n't you have love for our Holy Catholic Church ? Now is the time to prove it . It is , sir . ( He finishes buckling the sword. ) p. 88 PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES I prefer your guitar , Basilio , to your tongue . ( To FATHER LOPEZ . ) Yes , let us consider  --  and let us pray over the matter . FATHER LOPEZ The Holy Spirit will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Center Stage scene . The LIGHT comes up full there again . FATHER LOPEZ calls out to ORIBA and his people . ) Our leader , Don Pedro Menendez de Aviles , Governor of Florida and his Majesty 's Captain General of the ocean seas , is honored in the beautiful Princess Notina , mighty cacique Oriba . ( He bows to ORIBA . DOMINGO is standing by ORIBA and is seen speaking swiftly to him , translating FATHER LOPEZ ' words , though the chief gets the drift of their meaning . He nods and nods . FATHER LOPEZ goes on . ) But our God says she must first be taught the true faith of the church  --  and she must be baptized  --  and then peradventure  --  ( He clasps his hands in front of him . ) NOTINA I will be baptize now  --  tonight . Already I believe in Him  --  ( She points upward . ) FATHER LOPEZ No , child , not tonight . But soon . ( Oriba considers. ) p. 89 ORIBA ( Finally . ) Mani  --  yes . PEDRO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us drink to the Lady Notina ! ( Cups and mugs are raised . ) VOICES Viva ! Viva ! Notina ! ( The serving of the wine has been watched over by ALBAREZ . Of the Indians only ORIBA and NOTINA receive drinks . ORIBA starts to gulp down a gulletful all at once , gets choked and blows out a shower of red drops from his mouth . But he likes it and grunts for more . At his gesture off-scene the Indian FLUTES and DRUM set up again and the maidens quickly break into their mating dance once more , beginning at full speed where they were interrupted earlier . They circle around MENENDEZ and NOTINA . The dance builds quickly to conclusion . Loud applause follows from the colonists , and now the burst of GUITAR music off-scene floods in just as it had in the King 's palace scene . MENENDEZ escorts NOTINA to the upper platform , and he stands on one side of her and ORIBA on the other . Now EVA and the other girls spring out into the middle of the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a way as to simulate gypsies . This dance begins pretty much at the point where it too had been interrupted earlier . And as it builds , the whole scene gets caught up into its spirit  --  colonist men , women , and children , and also some of the Indians . In fact a few of the colonist men pull two or three of Notina 's maids into the rhythm of the action . One young brave shows his jealousy and pulls his sweetheart away from DE LA CRUZ . Handclapping , stamping of feet , and cries now and then urge on the pulsing of the vivacious scene . CAPTAIN ALBAREZ , over at the Left front , watches . EVA joyously gets him by the hand and pulls him into the dance . For just an instant he seems to be forgetful of everything and turns wildly about with her there in front of all the now eager-gazing faces , for the other dancers slow down watching them . Then ALBAREZ steps away and goes out at the Left . The dance builds a bit more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roars his approval , reaching over to pound MENENDEZ ' back in his fervor . NOTINA opens her new fan , looks deep into MENENDEZ ' face and begins lazily to fan him . The people grow quiet. ) p. 90 PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( With deep feeling . ) Tonight our hearts are full of the rich promise of Divine Grace . That promise waits for our own fulfillment . The days to come will test our strength , our faith and our endurance . We know that . ( Indicating the Indians . ) But with these dear people united to us in the bonds of brotherhood and love , we now shall succeed where all others have failed ! I believe it , I know it !

Gay dance MUSIC strikes up from the unseen guitars , and the people go twirling and gamboling out at the Left front . MENENDEZ leads NOTINA along , ORIBA following . ITUFA springs in front of them shaking his gourds menacingly . ORIBA seizes him by the collar and flings him aside . The medicine man lets out a high screech and runs away into the darkness at the Right . NOTINA now puts her arm around the Governor 's waist as they go on out . The scene is empty for an instant . The music continues . In the distance the people raise a cheer. ) p. 91 PEOPLE Viva ! Viva ! Saint Augustine ! ( The MUSIC dies and the scene fades out . The LIGHTS come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military TRUMPET blows a strong and commanding call , building to a fortissimo drum and timpani roll . After a short silence the theatre MUSIC strikes up the opening hymn for the act and plays it through once . Following this , the chorus , live and recorded as before and accompanied by the music , sings the hymn with swelling power . CHORUS The sun flames up the sky , &nbsp; &nbsp; In tumult roll the seas , Wild trumpets rage and cry &nbsp; &nbsp; Their hates and fealties.In clang and iron dins &nbsp; &nbsp; Man 's volleyed threats are hurledAnd vengeance on his sins &nbsp; &nbsp; Pours vengeance on the world .

After an instant of silence we hear the sound of wood-chopping in the darkness at the Left front . The SPOTLIGHT comes on near the left side-hillock , revealing BASILIO there cutting a little log into pieces of firewood . He gives a few more chops , then stops and wipes the sweat from his face with his hand . He looks out at the audience and speaks briskly as narrator. ) p. 93 BASILIO BONITO With the land purged of the pirates and the treaty of peace and friendship signed with the great Indian Chief Oriba , all seems clear ahead now for the permanent building of St. Augustine and the spreading of the gospel among the Indians  --  I say seems  --  and the work goes on . The Governor himself is like one of these Florida hurricanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roaring force . He has explored far and near , by sea as well as by land , mapping rivers , channels , reefs and harbors . ( Gesturing before him . ) There with the winter waterdrops sparkling and quivering in his beard , his fiery eye flashing out at his men , his stern jaw set , Pedro Menendez de Aviles goes crashing on , moving ahead , conquering and beating back the terrors of the wilderness to win this struggle he is set to win . ( He waits as if listening . Far away and over the sound track comes the huge voice of MENENDEZ . ) MENENDEZ VOICE Forward , men ! Forward ! BASILIO BONITO And ever he is vigilant for food and supplies for the colony . And well that he is so , for during the ten months since the landing here only a scanty supply of provisions has reached us from Spain . The governor fears the raging wars at home are taking the nation 's substance .

At any time now we will be parents to the first baby to be born in Saint Augustine , aye , the first little soul to mark the beginning of this vast and mighty nation .

But day after day it goes on . Yea , just there in the coquina pits which Captain Albarez discovered , the colonist men are sweating and digging out the shells tone . " Make the foundations of our houses strong , " says the Governor , " for we build not only for ourselves but for people to come .

A number of youths are pantomiming lifting and carrying the heavy blocks and stacking them in convenient piles , later to be hauled off in carts or man - pulled sleds , and then turning back for more . All the actions are concerted to the rhythm of the music  --  the swinging of the invisible picks , the prying with the unseen crowbars , the lifting and the carrying and the stacking  --  all a sort of visual round or canon , as it were , in sequent motion . The scene presently fades out , the MUSIC dies , and the LIGHT brightens on BASILIO again . ) BASILIO BONITO And always the Governor is pushing forward the clearing of the fields , the digging of the soil , the planting and the gleaning day after day .

A circle of blue LIGHT fades in high up at the Right rear , and there a little wayside shrine is disclosed . The LIGHT fades down on BASILIO as before as he stands looking out at the little scenelet . The BELLS stop ringing . ) CHOREOGRAPHED ACTION B ( The unseen chorus , live and recorded , begins to sing softly in the background . FATHER LOPEZ is seen standing by the shrine now with a lifted cross in his hands . Kneeling in front of him are a number of Indian women and children and one or two old men . In the edge of the light ITUFA , the shaman or witchman , is defiantly facing him with his lifted motionless gourds . FATHER LOPEZ is blessing the people . The words of the chorus come in softly and in almost indistinguishable syllables . ) CHORUS Adoremus in aeternum sanctissimum Sacramentum.Laudate Dominum gentes.Quoniam confirmata est super nos misericordia ejus , Gloria Patri et Filio.Sicut erat in principio , et nunc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOPEZ is seen lowering the cross to be kissed by hungry lips .

DOMINGO turns back the way he came . FATHER LOPEZ gestures in stern beckoning after him , but DOMINGO goes on his way . The Father now moves among the people blessing them . The scene slowly fades out , and the chorus ends . The LIGHT brightens on BASILIO again. ) p. 97 BASILIO BONITO And daily the Indian children come here to Saint Augustine to be taught . But the chief Oriba never allows them to stay the night . The Indian king is growing more sullen and hard to traffic with , no doubt feeling more and more the insult to his royal honor the longer the Governor delays in taking his sister Princess Notina to wife . I keep exhorting His Excellency to be circumspect and watchful and to marry her when she returns soon from her schooling in Havana . ( With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already married , but his wife is in Spain and our most bounden duty is here to make Saint Augustine live . So  --  ( Now directly to the audience. ) may not a man do a small wrong in order to bring about a greater good ? I ask you . ( With another shrug . ) No answer . ( From the darkness of the Center Stage the mission BELL rings . BASILIO sticks his axe in the little log and squats down and gathers up an armful of firewood , then rises . The BELL stops . ) Father Lopez is calling the children to their lesson . And they do learn wondrous fast in music and the Catechism  --  no matter how hard it be for them to learn to wear clothes . The Governor with all his multitude of duties ever encourages them and listens to their fears and troubles , so filled is his heart with love for them . He sees to it too that now and then little plays and scenes and tableaux from Holy Scripture are shown to better their understanding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play a devil 's part in the nativity scene . Ahem . And Eva Gonzales , bless her lonely heart , is ever wonderful working with them . Listen  --  ( From the darkness of the Center Stage , the theatre MUSIC begins playing an introduction to a sacred canon , " Laudemus Virginem , " followed by the sound of children 's voices singing . BASILIO goes down the incline into the shadows , whistling the melody of the canon as he goes . He has hardly . disappeared when BUZZARD ONE-EYE pops out of the woods , seizes the axe from the little log , takes a springing leap after him , and then stops , seeing that this former slave is nighing the safety of the fort . He darts back into the woods , carrying the axe with him . The scene fades out , and the LIGHT comes up on the Right Center Stage. ) p. 98 p. 99 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE 2 Some ten or twelve Indian children are standing in a loose group in front of FATHER LOPEZ who is beating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left of the group singing with them . The children are of various ages and sizes , and several of them have not yet learned to be comfortable in their European dress . Now and then they twist about and scratch themselves . A few of the larqer girls wear moccasins , but all the boys and the smaller girls are barefooted . The voices are in three groupings , and each group is following the other in a set pattern . When the first group begins the second word " Virginem , " the second group is beginning the first word " Laudemus . " And when this second group is beginning the " Virgin em " the third group is starting with the first word " Laudemus . " And so on . CHILDREN Laudemus Virginem Mater est , Et ejus Filio Jesus est  --  Plangamus scelera acriter , Sperantes in Jesum jugiter . ( As the round continues , MENENDEZ comes stepping in from the Left front . He is accompanied as usual by his bodyguard of two men with muskets , RAFAEL RAMOS , 29 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his personal flag . He carries his lance as always . The attendants move over to the Right and wait as the Governor stops and listens to the children 's singing with beaming face . Presently he joins happily in the singing . The canon is repeated , the bright voices ending with a strong three-part harmony . Then the music begins introducing the next canon . During the singing , a little lad five or six years old has been twisting and turning about more than any of the others , scratching between his legs and trying to endure his discomfort . Surreptitiously he slides off his trousers and shirt and throws them aside and now stands naked save for his little piece of rabbit fur flap . Since he is in the rear he is not at first noticed by FATHER LOPEZ . The second canon begins . ) Splendens captigera , Nostris sis advocata  --  ( The music accompaniment makes a discord as FATHER LOPEZ spies the naked little boy , for the little fellow in his eagerness to add his voice , however off key and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FATHER LOPEZ claps his hands for everything to stop . He comes around to the little boy who shies away from the stern countenance looking down at him .

( Some of the children look around and giggle . ) Put clothes on ! ( He moves toward the boy , who runs behind BROTHER DOMINGO . ) Brother Domingo , have him clothe his shame . BROTHER DOMINGO DE FLORIDA Why not let him be , Father ? It is thus he runs in the forest . FATHER LOPEZ ( In sharp reprimand . ) Brother Domingo ! DOMINGO . He is so small  --  and  --  and innocent . FATHER LOPEZ Mark ye , it is a sin not to be clothed . When Adam and Eve were driven from the garden they were ashamed that they were  --  er  --  naked .

MENENDEZ squats down by the boy . The little fellow now nods also and suddenly grins . MENENDEZ looks up at FATHER LOPEZ . ) Nahia in the Indian tongue means lightning . That 's his name , Father . p. 101 BROTHER DOMINGO DE FLORIDA The exact translation is " forked lightning . " PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Chuckling . ) " Nahia "  --  Forked Lightning . Good name . Good boy  --  heh ? ( He makes a rumbling sound imitative of thunder and then a loud ripping noise ending in an explosive lightning-thunder crack . Little NAHIA jumps joyously up and down .

Two or three elderly Indians enter at the right and stand looking on . The Indian children , with the few colonist children , led by BARBARA RIVAS and DOMINGO , now enter at the Left rear front . They all carry unlighted candles and gather at the Right front and Center , most of them taking seats on the ground . The BELL stops ringing and the unseen chorus , live and recorded , and accompanied by the theatre MUSIC , begins a wordless off-scene harmony . BARBARA goes up and stands on an upper platform at the far Left . She is dressed in a simple long garment , a sort of lady of mercy smock , and wears a blue scarf over her hair . The children , especially the Indians , are full of expectancy and wiggle and whisper to one another as they keep their eyes on BARBARA . The general LIGHTING fades out and a spot remains on her .

In hoc festo sanctissimoSit laus et jubilatioBenedicamus Domino.Alleluia ! ( Near the end of the singing , BARBARA , EVA , BROTHER DOMINGO , and FATHER LOPEZ all move away at the Left , the Father carrying an illuminated cross . The children follow with their lighted candles held before them . As EVA passes ALBAREZ he reaches out as if to touch her . She looks at him , bows her head and goes on . He remains alone in the scene . The LIGHT brightens on him . The singing is heard dying away in the distance . ALBAREZ now goes over and stops in front of the big cross . He lowers his head as if in something of an attitude of prayer though not yet ready to fall on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly in at the Left . She has dispensed with both the halo and the baby . She stops and then moves over and waits behind ALBAREZ He turns and sees her . She smiles somewhat wistfully at him . ) CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ ( His voice shaking with emotion . ) If Saint Augustine lives , then you , you more than the Governor , more than I or anyone else , will have brought life to it . The way you work with these Indian children  --  the way  --  ( His voice dies out. ) p. 112 EVA GONZALES ( Her lips trembling . ) It is you and the Governor who are building this city , Jose . I only want to help . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ ( Striking his breast . ) In here  --  I do n't know  --  so long I have been unable to tell you  --  and now  --  and now  --  ( His voice dies out again , and he stands looking at her , his strong hands wiggling nervously at his side . ) EVA GONZALES ( Smiling through her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been patient with me . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ ( Astounded . ) Mercy of heaven , patient with you ! EVA GONZALES Till I had proved myself to you  --  and to the others . And I have tried , have tried hard , Jose . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ It is you who have been patient with me . Forgive me . ( In a burst of fervent words . ) Here tonight  --  seeing you there with the infant Jesus  --  in the little play  --  you so good , good , Eva  --  and therefore beautiful to me  --  yes  --  it was as if the light from that manger and the light from that star shining above you poured into my heart , making it warm and free at last  --  and wonderful . Yes , yes !  --  And I whispered to myself , " Forgive me . " You did n't hear me , but I said it  --  and now I say it again , forgive me ! ( He moves closer to her , then reaches out and puts his hands on her shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , how you have labored these months  --  helping the sick , teaching the children , ever encouraging those around you ! And all the while me burning in a cauldron of hurt and selfish pain . p. 113 EVA GONZALES ( Her eyes luminous with tears . ) All the while , day and night , night and day , you working , working , never resting , never thinking of yourself  --  always of others , others . Ever I wondered at your great strength . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ ( Almost with a happy shout . ) I am a man and could last through it ! EVA GONZALES ( Almost gaily . ) I am a woman and I want to last through it . ( She smiles up at him with naive pride . ) CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ ( Soberly . ) And pray God that you may  --  that all of us may . ( Staring off above her head . ) What hardships you have suffered ! ( Shaking his shoulders . ) And it hurts in here  --  to think of your enduring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a touch of anxiety . ) No danger threatens us , Jose . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ It will , I fear , and soon . It is well enough for the Governor  --  bless his great and noble heart  --  to talk of love and brotherhood of man . But when people are hungry , their stomachs care little for ideals . And the city of Saint Augustine is growing hungry . If supplies are delayed much longer in coming , the soldiers may ' try to take by force the food the Indians refuse to give in trade . p. 114 EVA GONZALES ( Firmly . ) But Pedro Menendez de Aviles will never turn against these beloved people nor allow others to do so . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ Yet if it come to a choice between saving Saint Augustine or attacking the Indians  --  then what ? EVA GONZALES Then he would say the sacrifice is too much for him to give . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ And Saint Augustine then would perish . He has taken a sacred oath to succeed here or die . EVA GONZALES And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war came , the Indians might prove too strong for us . ( Almost with a cry . ) No , no , it must never be ! ( With forced brightness . ) But we are borrowing trouble for nothing , Jose . Surely the merciful Father in Heaven will not let so dreadful a thing happen . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ Well , the merciful Father should bestir himself soon . For we human souls have nigh done all we can . EVA GONZALES But supplies from Spain will come any day now . They will , they will . We must pray , Jose , pray , pray . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ You pray , and I will keep my soldiers and muskets ready . ( With a touch of grimness . ) You see , I have been a man of arms so long that I can only speak as a soldier , think as a soldier , act as a soldier . So  --  ( EVA suddenly grabs his hands and swings them to and fro . A happy and spontaneous laugh breaks from her as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La , la , only a soldier ! You are more than that , Jose , more . Do n't you see ? You are now what you always longed to be  --  a builder now , a great builder ! You remember you always wanted to build things . Well , here you have , you have . Think of the houses you have planned and made into homes in Saint Augustine , the fields cleared , the crops planted , the roads made ! And who was the moving spirit behind it all ? You  --  you ! Who was it discovered the coquina rock ? You ! Who has kept the men inspired to do their best while the Governor was away ? You , my darling . ( Excitedly , her eyes sparkling . ) Oh , Jose , you see God had his plans for you and me all the while  --  the great Heavenly Builder  --  plans for us to come here to this new land of hardship and struggle and make our lives new and splendid and fulfilled and joyous as we were meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war and trouble ! We have so much do  --  so much  --  you and I  --  CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ ( Fervently . ) You are wonderful and noble , Eva  --  and beautiful ! And I  --  I love you ! I love you ! ( He pulls her fiercely into his arms and kisses her . She clings to him . MENENDEZ comes in at the Right front with his attendants . He stops in the edge of the scene and holds up his hand for silence . The men stop a few steps behind him . After a moment he comes on into the scene . ALBAREZ and EVA separate and turn toward him , ALBAREZ still holding her hand and unembarrassed. ) p. 116 PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( With a chuckle . ) Well , thanks be unto God , life must have its way and so death be beaten back through all generations . ( He goes up and embraces them , kissing EVA on both cheeks . She turns away her blushing face , then seizing the Governor 's hand , kisses it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Excellency ! ( She turns and runs away into the shadows at the Left . MENENDEZ watches her go . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Turning to ALBAREZ . ) You are fortunate , my Capitan , and she is fortunate in you . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ And thanks be to God at last  --  and thanks be that she has saved me from myself . Now I know  --  I feel her greatness and her beauty . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Amen . This , sits well to my heart . In the union of you two I read a good augury for Saint Augustine and the future of this land . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ And I say amen to that , my beloved leader . ( MENENDEZ gives him a sharp glance from beneath his shaggy Brows . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Abruptly , as he gazes off . ) Have the hunters returned to the fort ? p. 117 CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ All save Juan Rivas . And with two small hares . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES And no sign of a sail from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the city would already be in a bedlam of rejoicing . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( To his attendants . ) Report to Captain Ochoa ! ( The men march on across the front of the Center Stage and out at the Left . MENENDEZ turns to ALBAREZ who has moved over and taken up his tools . ) I must go again to Chief Oriba . We still have a few hatchets and mattocks we can offer in trade for food . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ And he will ask again for pikes and muskets . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES And these he can not have . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ And ask why you do not marry the sister he gave to you . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( With a touch of rage . ) I can not commit this sin by marrying this woman . I can not . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ Mayhap in God 's sight it would not be a sin , with so much depending on it . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Clapping his great hands together and shaking his head . ) Aye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too is beautiful to my lonely hungry eyes . ( Gesturing toward his cabin . ) One night she came and stood by my bed there . I awoke from a dream of her and there she stood in the Florida moonlight , straight and beautiful . Only devout prayer saved me from sin  --  and saved her , too . I pushed her away from me and next day sent her to Havana for religious training , and so kept my immortal soul from hell fire . May an all  --  watchful God continue to give me strength ! p. 118 CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ And her brother , the Chief Oriba , continues insulted and angry . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES He has no comprehension of sin . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ Soon she must return from Havana , and when she stands by your bed again  --  PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Waving his hands dismissingly in the air . ) Say no more , no more , I beg you . ( There is a shout off at the Right front by the side  --  hillock , and JUAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt bloody and torn , is pushed in by BUZZARD ONE-EYE and another warrior . Coming behind is the angry CHIEF ORIBA . He carries a long lance in his hand instead of his staff of state . His trailing robe is lifted along by two youths as before , but he has dispensed with his fan-bearers . MENENDEZ turns as the Chief enters . ALBAREZ , ever watchful , calls toward the fort . ) CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ Captain Ochoa ! PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Mind not , Captain Albarez . The chief comes as our friend . ( ITUFA comes tearing down the right side  --  hillock into the scene with his lifted gourds . ORIBA puts out his hand , and the witchman stops and stands in quivering silence beside his chief. ) p. 119 ORIBA I come with fire  --  here in cumele  --  my heart . ( He slaps his breast . ) Him  --  Juan Rivas  --  enters my land  --  kills my deer . My men take him  --  abotosiro  --  beat him . ( He stands glaring out at MENENDEZ . The GOVERNOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now turns wrathfully on RIVAS . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES You know my orders on pain of punishment  --  no one to encroach on the Indian lands beyond the creek . Answer , speak , say why you should not be flogged a second time and fastened in irons . ( Thundering . ) Answer me ! JUAN RIVAS ( In a babble of half-sobbings . ) Beat me , hang me , do what ye will , Your Excellency , but I can not sit by and see my sick Barbara a-hungered and not seek for food . ( Gasping out his words . ) I shot a deer this side the stream . He staggered on through the water to the other side and dropped dead there . I waded to him , my lawful game , and was lifting him away  --  when these two  --  ( He jerks his head toward BUZZARD ONE-EYE and the warrior. ) fell upon me and dragged me to the chief . And he had them beat me  --  ( Panting. ) beat me till  --  till the blood ran down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coughing and spluttering . CAPTAIN OCHOA with a few of his men come hurrying in at the Left front and stand on guard. ) p. 120 PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( To OCHOA . ) Take Rivas to the stockade . JUAN RIVAS No , no , Your Honor ! PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Have the surgeon put medicament on his wounds . Then confine him in irons till I order him freed . JUAN RIVAS ( His voice rising in a wrathful wail . ) So ye make this colony suffer for these heathen savages . So be it , and we will all perish here . ( Almost screaming . ) It is you , sir , who are bringing us down to death ! ( Scathingly . ) Nay , you do not build Saint Augustine , you destroy it . ( He bursts into sobs . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Quietly and somewhat kindly . ) I know your feelings , Corporal Rivas , I know . JUAN RIVAS You do not know . Wait till they beat you with their rawhide whips . PEDRO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaten , my lad , with worse than whips , so is Captain Albarez . But we do not whine . CAPTAIN JOSE ALBAREZ ( Loudly . ) Show respect to His Excellency , I bid you ! p. 121 JUAN RIVAS Why should a dying man show respect  --  or why should he wish respect ? ( At a gesture from ALBAREZ two of Ochoa 's men come forward , take hold of RIVAS and lead him off at the Left . His ailing wife BARBARA comes wavering in , meeting them . ) BARBARA AZEDO ( With a cry . ) Juan ! ( She hurries to him . ) What ! Oh merciful heart of Jesus ! Juan , Juan , my poor husband ! ( She croons and moans over him as he is escorted on into the shadows . MENENDEZ moves over toward ORIBA . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES No more it shall happen , my brother . I come to my brother for food once more  --  I bring many gifts  --  ORIBA ( Interrupting roughly . ) My brother speaks with two tongues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It sticks there , its shaft shaking in the air . ) Your men come kill my deer once again more , then I kill the men . ( Sternly . ) Where is my sister ? PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Watching the shaft of the spear grow still . ) She comes soon here from Havana  --  I say it , O motala . p. 122 ORIBA ( Mockingly . ) O motala , O motala . Yes , yes , I say so . ( Making slow wavings of his hand from east to west . ) The sun bird fly up the sky and go to rest behind the great sea in the dark night . Acuhiba the moon come big and go shiri small again . ( DOMINGO comes in from the direction of the chapel and stands looking on . ORIBA continues , apparently not noticing him . ) In my house taca ichi my fire is cold . The young men and young women go heavy heart  --  no singing , no balusobo dancing . Where is my sister ? ( Pointing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears  --  for her home , her brother , the mighty Chief Oriba . Ni mola-ti , he answers not . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Soon she comes again , I declare it . In Havana she learns of our blessed Savior , Jesus Christ , and the holy Virgin Mary . She yearns to be a Christian . ORIBA ( With a brutal laugh . ) Christianolesiro mantemala ! ( Shaking his great head . ) Not Jesu Christo for my sister but inihi husband .  --  You ! ( He points to MENENDEZ . ) Not Christianolesiro but ki-iquini baby here . ( He makes a baby feeding motion at his mighty chest. ) p. 123 PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Blessed be thy sister , the gentle Notina , oh mighty Chief Oriba . And as God wills , so shall it be done . ORIBA ( Sneeringly . ) Dios itimi numana God . The nayo viro white men pray to their God . He is weak .

( Loudly to DOMINGO . ) Sito , ponala ! ( DOMINGO instinctively leaps forward at the command and kneels before the chief . ORIBA puts his hand on his head . At the touch of it , DOMINGO springs to his feet , steps back and stands with bowed head . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Commandingly . ) Brother Domingo , I pray ye call for Father Lopez .

FATHER LOPEZ Our prayers go with you . BROTHER DOMINGO DE FLORIDA ( Loudly . ) Hear the thunder ? The storm is coming , the witchman is calling down the storm ! ( He turns and runs away at the Left . ) FATHER LOPEZ ( Aghast . ) What blasphemy does Brother Domingo speak !

PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Loudly . ) Then make all fast and we will away for provisions at the earliest hour . Go ! ( He turns and runs off at Left , ALVAREZ at the Right . The weather begins to rise . The creeping moan of the wind is heard approaching , and the tree tops above the fort at the Left rear suddenly start wavering and flapping their leafy branches about . A sharp flash of lightning splits vertically down the sky beyond the woods at the Right rear , followed immediately by a great booming bellow of THUNDER that shakes the buildings and sends the over-weening cross quivering and shuddering . Now the wind comes shrieking in , and a number of terrified colonists run down from their foraging in the woods at the Left front and scramble off at the Left toward the fort . The chapel BELL starts clattering and ringing like a thing bewitched . MENENDEZ comes running in , meeting ALBAREZ with several of his men . MENENDEZ , yelling above the storm . ) The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at the Right , ALBAREZ and his men running with him back the way they came . The frightened people , bowed into the wind and holding on to one another , come in from the Right and Left , moving as if in a choreography of fear and terror against the bursting violence of the storm and making their way forward toward the great cross and the entrance to the chapel . Some of them kneel and some of them fall down prone with raised and begging faces and hands. ) p. 126 PEOPLE Holy Mother of God , have mercy upon us . Have mercy , O Heart of Jesus ! Mercy ! Mercy ! ( The pleading words are echoed amplified in the sound track by the unseen chorus . FATHER LOPEZ comes wavering out of the chapel with a lifted crucifix in his hand . He calls loudly behind him . ) FATHER LOPEZ Brother Domingo ! Brother Domingo ! ( He looks back , but no DOMINGO appears as he comes on down among the people , moving the crucifix back and forth in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away in the demonic wind . ) Pax vobiscum ! Dominus sit vobiscum ! ( Now on the upper platform at the Left a number of other colonists are seen in the flashes of LIGHTNING trying to make their way in the tumult toward the protection of the chapel and the cross . Their movements also take on a choreographed quality as they lean and turn and buck against the gale , with their shawls and wraps streaming and fluttering and flying behind them . CONRADO CID and his wife LAURA , 25 , come pushing and beating their way in at the upper Left rear . LAURA looks yearningly behind her as her husband pulls her on . With soundless screams she points back . But CONRADO points to the chapel and the cross . There they will find protection . She shakes her head , struggles against him , and finally breaks free and dashes back the way she came . CONRADO reaches in the air calling her to return , then runs forward meeting her as she pulls little DIEGO forward into the scene . CONRADO lifts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cross to join the others . The storm increases . Pieces of thatch are blown away from the chapel , and stray palmetto fronds go flying across the front of the scene like great awkward and helpless birds . The people and the chorus in the sound track intensify their petitions and frenzied lamentations . The storm builds to a climax. ) p. 127 PEOPLE Miserere mei , Deus , Et secundum multitudinem miserati onum tuarum , Amplius lava me ab iniquitate mea  --  Amplius lava me ab iniquitate mea ! ( The THUNDER and LIGHTNING come less often now , and the fury of the wind begins to subside almost as swiftly as it rose . Ejaculations of joy break from the people 's lips . ) Deo gratias ! Deo gratias ! ( FATHER LOPEZ looks up at the sky , waving his crucifix in benediction over the people . The clouds part , and the scene is suddenly bathed in the almost unearthly radiance of a beneficent evening sun .

Presently a TRUMPET is heard over at the Left front . The LIGHT comes up there. ) p. 128 Act 2 , Scene 3 SCENE 3 A room in Governor Osorio 's house in Havana . The setting is a colorful one , somewhat regal in its splendor as if the governor with his gonfalons and banners draped and hanging about had intended a copy of the room in the king 's palace in Madrid which we saw earlier . When the LIGHT comes up OSORIO is standing in front of a throne-like chair of damask and gold . A richly carved table covered with documents is in front of him . MENENDEZ , a grizzled and weather-beaten and somewhat forlorn figure , is standing before him . OSORIO is speaking sharply and volubly , even jeeringly . GARCIA OSORIO Ah , my poor Pedro Menendez , with you standing here in Havana so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and change , I see my prophecies all confirmed . In Madrid did I not tell you  --  PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES And now you are telling me once more ! GARCIA OSORIO ( Smiling . ) Aye , and again and again I But come , my friend , move your dying colony here from the sucking sands of Florida . As we build Havana strong and mighty so does Spain control the sea and this new land . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Looking at OSORIO out of bloodshot eyes . ) I have sworn to build a permanent settlement in Florida or leave my bones as a sacrifice for what I did intend ! p. 129 GARCIA OSORIO ( Chuckling . ) And from the looks of thee and how thy bones already protrude through thy face , such a leaving , such a depositing will not be long in coming . My men tell me you dared the raging seas without a compass . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES My compass was broken . God was my guide . GARCIA OSORIO Then God be with you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his hand . ) I can spare no food or supplies for you ! PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Humbly but fervently . ) I believe God 's favor is still on Saint Augustine , even so . I have His promise  --  and in the deep night I hear His voice speaking to me . GARCIA OSORIO ( Throwing back his head and laughing . ) Yea . I remember in Madrid there before the King , you talked of your love for these natives . See to what a pass this love has brought you ! Here my way is different . I say " Obey " and I am obeyed . My rule is just and those who rebel are punished . Havana is flourishing while Saint Augustine is perishing . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Intensely . ) I beg of you . As a Spaniard who counts his honor his life , I abjectly plead that you help Saint Augustine ! p. 130 GARCIA OSORIO Nay ! PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Even food for a few days might save us . Surely His Majesty 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes narrowing . ) Provided they are not boarded and kept here at Havana ! GARCIA OSORIO ( Loudly . ) So , by that you accuse me ! PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES If it hurts , then it finds its mark ! ( OSORIO swells with anger , then controls himself and smiles . He points to the gold chain around MENENDEZ ' neck . ) GARCIA OSORIO Mayhap I could spare supplies for a few days  --  say 500 ducats ' worth . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES But I have no ducats . GARCIA OSORIO You have your golden chain presented to you by His Majesty . I was present the day he placed it around your neck . I know a money-lender who would advance 500 ducats for that . I will send for him . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Taking off the chain . ) Nay , you need not . For it is you that crave this chain . Give me the ducats . And may His Majesty forgive me for letting it fall into such hands . ( He hands the chain to OSORIO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GARCIA OSORIO I will fetch the money ! ( At this moment a Spanish young lady is ushered in at the rear by a page . She is elegantly dressed , and is accompanied by an elderly nun . The two embrace in farewell , and the nun goes away . MENENDEZ does not recognize the lady . OSORIO bows to the lady and speaks somewhat jeeringly . ) You know this lady , do you not , Your Excellency ? ( He laughs and goes on out . The young woman comes up to MENENDEZ and curtsies and stands modestly waiting . MENENDEZ bows quite gallantly to her , then peers forward . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( With a shout : ) Notina ! ( She breaks into an artless laugh , runs up to him , grabs both of his hands and stares at him . ) NOTINA ( Now without any accent . ) Ah , the long days and the nights would never end , waiting  --  waiting ! And now you have come for me ! PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Surely it can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom my brother gave to you for wife , and you sent me here to school . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Aye , aye . NOTINA ( Slightly mockingly . ) Aye , aye  --  ( Then soberly . ) I have learned much in the blessed Bible and from the holy sisters and brothers . ( Intoning swiftly and joyously . ) Credo in unum Deum  --  patrem omnipotentem , factorem caeli et terrae , visibilium et invisibilium . Et in unum Dominum , Jesum Christurn , Filium Dei unigenitum. p. 132 PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Thanks be unto God for your great salvation ! Now you will come to your people and will help to teach them  --  help us to be brothers and friends through an difficulty . NOTINA Your people are my people and I go with you in your ship . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES But this is a time of storms and the wild sea rages . My ship is small . NOTINA Though the hungry waves try to eat me up alive , with you I will not be afraid . PEDRO MENENDEZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we both must trust . NOTINA Now I make ready to go with you . ( She lifts his hand , kisses it and runs away as she came . OSORIO enters . He hands a little bag of gold to MENENDEZ , who takes it without looking at it . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Lifting his eyes . ) And into Thy keeping , Heavenly Father , I commend this woman and myself .  --  Amen . ( He turns and hurries away . OSORIO stares after him chuckling , then sits down behind his desk . A young man , his SECRETARY , enters , and the GOVERNOR begins his dictation. ) p. 133 GARCIA OSORIO " It is certain , Your Majesty , that the colony of Saint Augustine is failing , and I have taken it upon myself to recommend to Pedro Menendez de Aviles that he remove the survivors here to Havana .

( While he is talking , three or four forlorn and weakened colonists come wandering in , go over and kneel in silent prayer before the great crucifix . They wear old capes or ragged pieces of sacking over their heads and around their shoulders . From their lips come a few broken words. ) p. 135 COLONISTS ( As they pass . ) Pray for us , Father . Pray that we yet may live  --  live ! FATHER LOPEZ ( Without looking around . ) My prayers go constant up to heaven , my children .

Suddenly over at the Left front , the voice of CORPORAL JUAN RIVAS is heard in a high shout . ) RIVAS ' VOICE What say ye , men ! Are ye with me ! VOICES Yea , Juan Rivas !

The sleep MUSIC sets up its heavenly flute and guitar melody again . He closes his eyes but not to sleep , rather to turmoil in his soul . After a moment the sudden dissonance in the music occurs , depicting something of the turbulence of his now beginning nightmare dreaming . As the dissonantic music continues , a blue LIGHT comes on at the high rear of the Center Stage and there appear the configurations of MENENDEZ ' special mental torture  --  JEAN RIBAUT and his men once more .

Raucous snickering bursts from the hollow mouths of the phantoms . The words are repeated , likewise the gesturing and the snickering . MENENDEZ groans aloud . A huge figure now slides into the foreground of the scrim scene , and the ghosts of RIBAUT and his men are abolished to the shadows at the rear .

See , with the sword of blood thou wouldst defile the Cross of Christ . Then die , thou hypocrite ! PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( With a scream . ) I am guiltless ! ( At his scream the scrim scene vanishes , the MUSIC ends , and the LIGHT which has shadowed down in the cabin during the vision now brightens .

NOTINA And would I might ever come to answer your call . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES ( Suddenly as he stares at her . ) Do you love me ? NOTINA ( Simply . ) I love you .

The great chief might still be friends and feed Saint Augustine now that I would give over and take thee as my own . ( His hand goes blindly out to her . Her body undulates like a slender reed in the wind , and then she stands straight and immobile , slowly shaking her head . ) NOTINA Did I not say I love you ? So you shall not make this sacrifice . Nay . Our strength together shall prevail . PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES But to shed the blood of your people with the sword , when I came to bring them the cross ! Your people !

The infant wail , lusty and strong , is heard again in the sound track . ) PEDRO MENENDEZ DE AVILES Since God doth not answer , this baby answers for Him . This new little creature must not die !

And in the hours before dawn he marched against his beloved Indians with fire and sword , and amid flames and killing , seized food for his starving colony . The Chief Oriba and Brother Domingo , now Sito , escaped with their warriors and some of their people into the deep jungle and there brewed their frenzy of hate and vengeance on the city of Saint Augustine . ( The LIGHT fades out from BASILIO . An Indian DRUM begins to thunder in the forest at the Right front .

And mixing in with all the sounds is a recorded medley of Indian flutes . Near the end of the dance CHIEF ORIBA , fiercely painted and with his long spear in his hand , comes flying in with ITUFA the witchman and takes charge . The dance builds to its climax , and ORIBA , SITO and ITUFA lead the maddened warriors off to attack Saint Augustine . They yell and shriek as they run .

A number of Indians also are shot down . ALBAREZ fires the cannon straight at a body of Indians who are rushing in at the Right front . This is the turning point in the battle . The Indians begin to give ground , taking their wounded and dead along with them as they go .
