SELECTED WORKS OF DJUNA BARNES ( 366 pp. ) - Farrar , Straus &; Cudahy ( $5.95 ) . <P> <P> Djuna Barnes has long been the dark lady of the New Directions anthologies , and in the ' 30s , when difficult writers were in vogue , her shadowy short novel Nightwood won the loftiest of testimonials . Every earnest Lit. undergraduate read the New Classics edition , with its foreword by T. S. Eliot praising its " great achievement of style , beauty of phrasing , brilliance of wit and characterization , and a quality of horror and doom very nearly related to that of Elizabethan tragedy . " <P> As the centerpiece of this collection of Djuna Barnes ' work , Nightwood still has its moments of beauty and wild wit . The novel 's chief strength is a marvelous ranter , " Dr. Matthew-Mighty **28;2387;TOOLONG . " He roars on for pages , mocking himself as a wretched transvestite , reviling dead gods and performing feats of verbal wire-walking , all to take a distraught Lesbian 's mind off her wandering mate . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " what has made me the greatest liar this side of the moon ? Telling my stories to people like you , to take the mortal agony out of their guts , and stop them from rolling about , and drawing up their feet , and screaming , with their eyes staring over their knuckles . .. " <P> But one moonstruck liar in a life of writing is hardly enough . The rest of what Author Barnes has written offers little but annoying , calculated imprecisions ( " her wide distilling mouth " ) and somber oboe passages . " No , I do n't feel horror , " someone says . " Horror must include conflict , and I have none ; I am alien to life , I am lost in still water . " So , most of the time , is Author Barnes . And even Nightwood suffers from that most irritating offense of difficult writing-the mysterioso effect that hides no mystery , the locked box with nothing in it .                @ @ @ @ @
