The battle between the Roman Catholic hierarchy and dissident priests over Pope Paul 's anti-contraception encyclical continues . Last week the major scene of conflict was Washington , D.C. , where Patrick Cardinal O'Boyle suspended one of his priests and threatened 51 others with disciplinary action unless they abandon their opposition to the Pope 's teaching . <P> The victim of the Cardinal 's punishment was the Rev. T. Joseph O'Donoghue , 37 , assistant pastor of St. Fran cis de Sales Church in northeast Washington . He is also a co-founder of the Association of Washington Priests , to which all the dissenters belong . Immediately after the encyclical was issued , Cardinal O'Boyle called upon his priests " to follow without equivocation , ambiguity or simulation the teaching of the church on this matter . " In answer , the 52 priests announced their endorsement of a statement originated by theologians from Catholic University of America holding that spouses may properly decide on the basis of their own consciences whether or not to practice contraception . <P> Confusing the Faithful . Father O'Donoghue was singled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter from the Cardinal urging the faithful to accept the Pope 's teaching in the encyclical . After reading the letter from the pulpit at Sunday Mass , O'Donoghue went on to quote from the Catholic University statement and from several European prelates who have emphasized the role of conscience in the birth control question . The Cardinal showed up at the St. Francis de Sales rectory , accused O'Donoghue of " insubordination " and " disturbing and confusing the faithful . " O'Boyle then suspended him from preaching , teaching and hearing confessions , ordered him to leave the rectory within five days . When O'Donoghue did so last week , more than 250 parishioners showed up at the rectory to protest his departure . <P> A jovial , kindhearted prelate who still speaks with a strong Irish brogue , O'Boyle had first tried persuasion with the recalcitrant priests . In a ten-page letter to each of them last month , he exuded a gentle , parental tone . " I hope you 'll read this through , " O'Boyle wrote . " Try to understand why I see things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own position . " When the priests replied , in a joint statement , that they were sticking to their position , the Cardinal warned a dozen of them that they might be suspended . He later summoned all 52 to his office and admonished them to accept the Pope 's teaching authority . He demanded individual written responses from all the priests by the end of this week .
