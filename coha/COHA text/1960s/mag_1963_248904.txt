Pursuing his presidential hopes westward , New York 's Governor Nelson Rockefeller landed at Salt Lake City , where he and his wife were greeted by a listless crowd of 100 . Then they went off to pay a protocol call on officials of the Mormon Church . Mormon First President David O. McKay , 90 , greeted Happy as " Mrs. Roosevelt . " <P> Nothing daunted , Rocky took to the attack in a speech before 2,000 at the University of Utah . Painting himself as the sensible traveler on a road between two dangerous paths , Rocky said : " The American people should not have to choose between an all-powerful Federal Government dominating our lives-the direction in which the Kennedy Administration is moving-nor , on the other hand , a Federal Government committed to withdraw from free world leadership and roll back the clock on social gains and human progress-the direction in which Senator Goldwater has indicated he would move . " His road , said Rocky , would be " the forward road . " <P> " The Title Is Right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airport , but at a press conference a reporter tossed him a curved question . What did Rocky have to say about an editorial in the Catholic magazine The Sign , calling for his withdrawal from the race because of his divorce and remarriage to a divorcee ? Said Rocky : " I would say that one of the greatest forces in a Christian community is love and understanding . And we can be very grateful for it . As far as the political side is concerned , should I become a candidate , the delegates at the convention , each in his own heart , will weigh all of the factors and make his or her own decision . " <P> <P> Flying on to Los Angeles , Rocky again had a disappointing reception . The marching band on hand at the airport did n't march . The drum majorettes seemed to have the dropsy . Picket signs advised , " This is Goldwater Country " and " Go Home Rocky . " Gamely , Rocky repeated his attacks on the Kennedy Administration and was roundly applauded for his efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he admitted that for him " the title of underdog is the right one . " <P> On the eve of his departure , the Los Angeles political smog seemed to be lifting for Rocky . A Rockefeller reception scheduled for some 500 drew 1,100 instead . Rocky and Happy , who had planned to spend an hour in the receiving line , were mobbed by enthusiastic handshakers and well-wishers for half an hour longer . Even Senator Goldwater 's children , Los Angeles Stockbroker Barry Goldwater Jr . and Housewife Mrs. Thomas Ross of suburban Torrence , turned up to say hello . And when Rocky mounted the platform to urge Republican unity , the hall rang with cheers . Grinned Rocky later : " It could n't have worked out better . I enjoyed every minute of it . " <P> Lots of Chuckles . As for Goldwater , he had a somewhat less strenuous week , making his only major appearance in Hartford , Conn . There , he agreed that he would be happy to accept the G.O.P. nomination if it comes his way : " Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't . " With that , the 200-member state Republican committee in Oklahoma shouted through a resolution pledging all 22 of the state 's national convention delegates to the Senator .
