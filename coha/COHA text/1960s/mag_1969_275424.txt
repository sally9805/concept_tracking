" Gentlemen , start your engines . " So goes the traditional opening of the Indianapolis 500 . Winning , a film shakily based on that classic competition , only misfires . <P> Fresh from Rachel , Rachel and stale from lack of motivation , Paul Newman and his wife Joanne Woodward career through the movie looking for an opportunity to display their talents .

Alas , Capua suffers from autoeroticism . Night after night ' he stays at the speedway , revving up his car instead of his wife . One morning he comes home to find her in the arms of another driver ( Robert Wagner ) . <P> Capua 's race relations deteriorate . The compulsive winner becomes a perpetual loser-until the day of the big one , the Indy 500 . Director James Goldstone even manages to make a wreck of the most celebrated American auto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement of a minute hand ; the script is reminiscent of a radio play , with an announcer booming : " It 's a different Frank Capua out there today ! " When the film casts a sociological eye , it is toward such riddled targets as baton-twirling teeny-boppers and accident-hungry spectators . <P> The stars obviously relish working together , and in fleeting scenes exhibit their celebrated force and subtlety , but Winning stifles any attempt at authentic emotion or excitement . The Newmans are harddriving , lifelong competitors ; both now seem ready for a pit stop .
