Satan Never Sleeps ( 20th Century-Fox ) . God , in Director Leo McCarey 's movies , is always good-especially for business . McCarey 's most famous religious pictures ( Going My Way , The Bells of St. Mary 's ) were shrewdly aimed to please the millions of Roman Catholic moviegoers , and they managed to charm plenty of Protestants too . In this picture , after a run of unsuccessful shows , McCarey has once more called upon religion to perform a commercial miracle ; but this time he appears to have used the Lord 's name in vain . For all its superficial smirk of piety , McCarey 's Satan is just a prurient , soft-soap-and-holy-water version of the spicy story about the lonely missionary and the beautiful native girl . <P> The missionary is William Holden , a priest who arrives in China just before the Communists take over . The beautiful native girl is France Nuyen , who is rescued by the padre from a flood . ' I love you ! " she sighs , and flings her arms around him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stop tantalizing me ! " She sneaks into his room at night . " Father , " she coos , " do n't you need anything ? " Pulling the covers over his chest , he wheezes in terror : " Get out ! " Pretty soon she has him ogling her while a Mass is being read . <P> Since this is a commercial movie the affair can not go much further . To end it without ending the erotic suspense , McCarey employs the old Notre Dame system : send in the second team . While the priest sits with his hands tied , a Communist colonel rapes the girl , gets her with child . But how can this appalling situation possibly produce a happy ending ? Leave it to McCarey . When the girl gives birth to his son , the colonel suffers an incredible conversion to Christianity and decides to marry her . This is an example of McCarey 's " warm , human touch . " The colonel , it turns out , is n't really a nasty Red rapist after all , see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
