The " glass womb " is made from two glass slides , one with a scarcely visible depression containing a ripe ovum . The slides are sealed together and attached to a heater that maintains a constant temperature of 97.7 F. Fluid containing male sperm is then dripped into a tiny fissure in the incubator slide and drawn into the " love chamber " by capillary action . Once fertilization occurs , the embryo is kept alive with regular feedings of oxygenated amniotic fluid , drawn from a pregnant woman . With " cold light " and highly sensitive film , color and black and white movies are made of the process of insemination and embryo development . Thus has Italy 's Dr. Daniele Petrucci successfully fertilized a human ovum outside the womb " more than 40 times . " <P> The act of insemination outside the human body is not new ; Harvard 's Dr. John Rock first achieved it in 1944 . What is remarkable is that Dr. Petrucci kept one fertilized egg alive for 29 days , and had to kill it because it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test-tube life span of six days . <P> For bearded Surgeon Petrucci , 38 , and his coworkers , Drs . Laura de Pauli and Raffaele Bernabeo , artificial insemination started as a sideline . They began growing test-tube human embryos three years ago , in a tiny lab behind Petrucci 's Bologna office , to get newborn cells for experiments in antibody response to transplanted tissue . " We had no intention of creating a ' man in the box , ' " says Dr. Petrucci . " Far from it . The problem today is to limit births , not increase them . " The doctors collected live ova from Petrucci 's female patients during hysterectomy or after sudden death . Since the ova had to be ripe for fertilization , Petrucci scheduled his female patients ' uterine operations to coincide with the egg 's maturation . Sperm was obtained from male patients who brought Petrucci semen for fertility analysis . <P> Could the embryos have developed further-into human beings ? " It is technically possible , " answered Dr. Petrucci . ' " We have overcome three obstacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange and metabolism . " Petrucci 's suggestion stunned the Roman Catholic Church . Its plain reply : the experiments should be stopped . At week 's end , bowing to pressure , Catholic Petrucci announced that he was leaving for a vacation in Switzerland .
