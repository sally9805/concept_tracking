For many optimistic and thoroughly modern citizens , the American Dream of the 1930s included not only a chicken in every pot and a car in every garage , but also an Autogiro in every backyard . Chickens and cars have proliferated , but the Autogiro-a prop-driven aircraft with a freewheeling rotor in place of a wing-has virtually disappeared , a victim of its own inefficiencies and the remarkable success of the helicopter . The dream may yet come true . California 's McCulloch Aircraft Corp . has successfully test-flown a contemporary Autogiro that is safer than a conventional plane , less expensive than a helicopter , and just about as easy to operate as an automobile . <P> McCulloch 's twin-boom J-2 gyroplane can virtually duplicate the performance of a helicopter . It can make a jump takeoff , cruise at 120 m.p.h. , maintain altitude at a forward speed of only 30 m.p.h. and settle gently to a spot landing . Should its engine fail in flight , the gyroplane can float safely to earth under its whirling rotor , much like a Cracker Jack toy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's unique feat of hovering motionless in midair . <P> Green Light . Compared with flying a helicopter , which often requires four separate control functions , and according to helicopter pilots is " like rubbing your head , patting your stomach and tapping time to Dixie with both feet , all at once , " operating the J-2 is a snap . After starting the engine and the J-2 's conventional push prop , the pilot depresses a lever at the side of his seat , temporarily engaging the engine to the overhead rotor . When the overhead ro tor reaches 520 r.p.m. , the pilot pushes a button to disengage the rotor and change its blade pitch from flat to 5 . While the kinetic energy in the whirling rotor blades provides lift , the engine delivers full power to the pusher prop . Between the lift and push , the gyroplane becomes airborne . <P> From the moment it is in the air , the J-2 can be flown like a fixed-wing craft with a joy stick that controls the tilt of the rotor blades and pedals that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booms . Lift is provided by the freewheeling rotor , which also acts as a gyroscope , tending to keep the J-2 extremely stable in flight . Unlike the helicopter , which is subject to constant torque from its powered rotor , the gyroplane experiences no twisting effect and needs no counteracting rotor and extra controls to provide stability . <P> Two Ways . To avoid the difficulties that beset the first generation of Au-togiros , J-2 's Designer Drago Jovanovich took advantage of modern helicopter technology , effecting many improvements in the control and design of the overhead rotor . The J-2 's rotor is stronger but also lighter and smaller than previous rotors , enabling it to be run up to speed faster . When heavier rotors used in the 1930s were al lowed to slow down , their inertia prevented them from being revved up quickly , causing control problems .
