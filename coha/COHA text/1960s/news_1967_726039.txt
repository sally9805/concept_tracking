txt Claude Kirk , Florida 's first Republican Governor in modern times , has assumed office in the smoothest change-over in two decades . Outgoing Democratic governors nave been at odds with their successors in recent years . But Governor Kirk was cordially welcomed by the Governor he replaced Jan. 3 , fellow townsman Haydon Burns of Jacksonville . The six elected state officers , who share power with the Governor under Florida 's unique cabinet system , promised full cooperation . Governor Kirk has been careful to ease the transition . He kept key members of the Burns staff to carry on office routine without a break . In particular he retained the Governor 's personal secretary , which political old-timers considered an inspired move . Mrs. Lucille Rodgers , who has held that post through two administrations , knows every person who matters in Florida politics on a first-name basis . Engineer chosen This was one of several moves which reinforced Mr. Kirk 's campaign pledge to provide bu5Messlike , nonpartisan leadership to meet the needs of Florida 's rapid growth . Another was the selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be its chairman , a post usually considered an incoming governors ' chief patronage plum . Mr. Kirk told the new chairman to put the roads where the people needed them , regardless of politics . The new Governor also declined to take a hand in selecting a $17,000-a-year executive for the state welfare department , telling the welfare board to fill the job on merit . As financial adviser , Mr. Kirk picked a veteran state legislator , a Democrat , who is probably the most experienced Floridian in state money matters . The developments reassured some who feared the Republican Governor would be neutralized by the Democrats who have run things for a hundred years , and that the state machine might falter at a critical time . Processes observed Reassuring , too , was the way Governor Kirk set about learning his job . Between election and inauguration he sat in on cabinet sessions where most decisions are made , speaking out only when his opinion was invited . He was a frequent observer at sessions of the Constitutional Revision Commission which is hammering out the draft of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support for a simplified , streamlined system . Democrats in office and out have responded to this nonpartisan approach . A surprising number showed up at a $100-a-plate dinner to help meet the Republican Governor 's campaign deficit . Attitude softened Mr. Kirk has continued to talk , as he did during the campaign , of expanding state services without major tax increases . He emphasizes more efficiency and common sense in running the state 's business and eliminating extravagance . In fact his pre-inaugural activity was a continuation of the low-keyed approach that proved remarkably effective during the race . At its organizational session the Legisla , ture , in which Democrats hold a 3-1 edge , showed some disposition to take over leadership and write its own ticket . This attitude now has softened and there is indication that Governor Kirk 's proposals will be carefully considered . These things explain why Florida Democrats who packed Tallahassee for the inaugural of a Republican Governor did not view the event as a catastrophe . In his inaugural address , Governor Kirk made it clear he considered meeting Florida 's needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
