One reason that the rulers of so many countries live in fear of revolution is that they are afraid to tackle the big problems . Thus conditions gradually become intolerable for the people at the bottom of the heap , and after a while for those farther up . Then the intellectuals become disaffected , and a revolutionary situation develops . This can - happen even while the economy as a whole is prosperous ; it depends on how it maintains its prosperity . The method the United States has resorted to ? arms manufacture and the exploration of space ? is perilous in the extreme . For that reason alone Harold Wilson 's speech at the Labour Party 's convention is worth reading and rereading . The American press paid scant attention to it one would have thought that Wilson was going to be the next Prime Minister of San Marino . Wilson said that it is time for a new politics . The old politics , practiced by old-line politicians and even to a large extent by New Frontiersmen , no longer works because we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnessing now is only the beginning . We can expect more changes in industry in the next fifteen years than there have been in the past 250 . Two hundred and fifty years ? that takes us back to 1713 ! What , then , will 1980 be like ? There is no way of stopping the scientific-industrial revolution and Wilson faced the fact when he told his audience , " We have no room for Luddites in the Labour Party . " Computers , now Making calculations in a millionth of a second , will be solving more complex problems in a trillionth of a second ; machine tools will all but reproduce themselves ; a flood of consumer goods produced with little human labor will inundate the market . The Labour Party , of course , stands for right-wing socialism , but that is the minimum for Britain 's problems today . " If there had never been a case for socialism , " Wilson said , " automation would have created it . " He called for a marriage of science and socialism to accelerate technological and social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the Republican Party seems likely to nominate a candidate who would , as the saying goes , like to repeal the twentieth century . Train more scientists , Wilson said , instead of worrying about those who emigrate to the United States and blaming the United States for offering them better laboratories and salaries . Then see that those scientists are creatively employed , not locked up in armament plants . No one would welcome socially useful employment more than the scientists . For every Edward Teller there , must be ten who are unhappy with things as they are and who would like to live in , and leave to their children , a world that looks to the future with hope , not with ' foreboding bordering on despair . It is no secret that C. P. Snow , J. Bronowsld. , P. M. S. Blackett and others have been trying for two decades to get the Labour Party to say what Wilson has now said . It is not that they are pressing technocracy on us ; competence as a scientist does not qualify anyone for politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have something to say on the larger is , sues that have baffled the traditional type of politician . What Wilson 's speech does mean ? and not only for Britain ? is that society must recognize the Scientific-industrial revolution in its entirety and make it serve mankind . Ticket for the GOP Only yesterday Richard M. Nixon was as good as buried politically . In his dying moments he even cursed ' the newspaper men to their faces , blaming them for his defeat in the California gubernatorial election . He avowed he was through , and many a voter felt America was the better for it . Yet here he is , live again and whole , solicited for help by the ailing Rockefeller and , as he says , ' at the eye of the hurricane . And , we may be sure , looking around him for whatever the hurricane may blow his way . Goldwater may change his ideas , or at least what he says publicly , as the Republican candidacy drifts within his reach , but Dick is much the same as when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas to speak of , in this he resembled General Eisenhower . But there was a striking difference , between the two men . Eisenhower had integrity and good will , and for these qualities one could respect him . In Nixon , ? whatever admirable qualities there may be ( such as being a good family man and kind to dogs ) are overlaid by a thick , dirty crust of opportunism . He seems constantly to be sniffing for some issue whose espousal can cost him nothing , but which may get him support from people so stupid or so prejudiced that they ca n't or wo n't think . Examples abound in Mr. Nixon 's October 12 Saturday Evening Post article , but since they are all much the same , one will suffice . He announces that only the mobilization of an aroused and informed American public opinion will prevent the sellout ( by Kennedy ) of the right of 97 million enslaved people in Eastern Europe to be free . " Our goal must be a free Cuba , a free Eastern Europe , a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be directed to reach that goal through peaceful means , " ( Italic 's added . ) The Nation has plumped for Goldwater as the Republican nominee . Since Goldwater is rather a trimmer , a fit running mate for him would be Nixon , who stands foursquare on the old hogwash , solidified under his feet . Such a ticket ? Goldwater for President , Nixon for Vice President  --  would lose , but the cam , paign would be more educational than if the Republicans nominated two of their more electable prospects . Handwriting on the Wall In the last eighteen months , six elected Latin American governments have been overthrown by the military . Except for Argentina , they were not among the most important ? although no Latin American government can be considered unimportant . But trouble is brewing in Venezuela and Brazil ; and they are not only big , but American investments there are big . It has frequently been pointed out that the United States no longer lands Marines to collect debts for U.S. corporations , but in an even more acute situation it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is widely reported in Washington that if something akin to Castroism takes over Venezuela the Marines will land . And then what ? Suppose Brazil follows ? Except that it has n't got as big an army , Brazil is as much of a man-trap as China . Are we going to occupy all of Latin America , in the name of democracy , if the Alliance for Progress should disintegrate ? Why do these misfortunes overtake us so regularly ? The Kennedy Administration , it is true , inherited a situation in which the mass of Latin Americans are illiterate , destitute and overly prolific . Largely , also , they depend for their living , such as it is , on one-crop economies subject to the vicissitudes of the world market , and are ruled by feudal and military oligarchies . Yet , with all these handicaps , it seems strange that such considerable sums of money poured into these countries have not ameliorated conditions appreciably , and that some well-intentioned regimes have been so easily overthrown by whatever tin-horn colonel happened to be in the saddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin American governments are overthrown by conspirators armed with American tanks , guns , ships and planes ; and as often as not the conspirators have had advanced military training in American service schools . Senator Gruening called attention to this outrage on both the American taxpayers and the Latin American peoples in a speech reported in the Congressional Record of October 1 . With a number of other Senators , Mr. Gruening has proposed an amendment to the foreign-aid bill to abolish all military aid to Latin American countries . In this speech Mr. Gruening points out once more that such " aid " had not added and will never add to the security of Latin America from invasion or infiltration by communism , which under these conditions grows from within . It merely serves , he shows , us an instrument for the overthrow of democratic institutions by the military , who loathe democracy and are glad to serve the small wealthy classes of their countries . Nor are these revolutions always displeasing to the Latin . American specialists ; who serve our government . Under John Foster Dulles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they instigated the successful uprising against Arbenz , which was prepared and consummated under the direction of the CIA and U.S. Ambassador John Peurifoy . There are people in Washington who have only two things on their minds : communism and the protection of American investments . To them , the military faction in a country menaced by popular discontent is the lesser evil . They may not regard it as an evil at all . Dictatorship of the Right ' seems to them better than anything which smacks of the Left , and the more so if the latter is clearly in the interest of the people of the country concerned . The Alliance for Progress may prove unworkable under any circumstances . But its chances for success are not enhanced by the fact that entrenched fac-Lions in the Washington bureaucracy are not in syni-pathy with its objectives . Managing tl-re News ' No one expects a newspaper or magazine office to be an abode of sweetness and light . It is something of a novelty , however , when the home-office staff of a national magazine sets out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil war in a country 10,000 miles away , under conditions of extreme difficulty and danger that have rarely been duplicated . This distinction belongs to Time , whose two correspondents in South Vietnam , Charles Mohr and Merton Perry , re. , signed in protest against an article critical of the American corps of correspondents , who were alleged to be painting the situation ' in colors darker than warranted by the facts . This would be something of a feat in itself , but the people in the New York office apparently wanted a more " constructive " attitude toward the war , less reflection on the Ngo ruling family , and not as much wordage on Buddhist monks burning themselves to death in protest . More is involved , however , than an intramural clash in the Time organization . Not long ago there was considerable ado in the U.S. press about governmental attempts to manage the news . The focus ' of the in , dignation was Arthur ' Sylvester , the press officer of the Defense Department , and the occasion was the confrontation over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sectors of the press are not averse to doing a bit of managing themselves . There are several techniques . The most familiar is to send out big-name journalists on Cook 's tours to survey the situation and present it according to their lights , which are well known in advance . Thus , when the New York Herald Tribune dispatched Marguerite Higgins to South Vietnam , it was a sure bet that what emerged from her typewriter would please the Ngos , General Harkins and the **30;1832;TOOLONG people in the Defense Department , the State Department , the CIA and civilian warriors outside the government . Miss Higgins covered pages and pages of the Trib with what amounted to an apologia for Ngo Dinh Diem . This made a goad many people in other editorial offices uneasy . Even The New York Times which , with Homer Bigart on the scene and now David Halberstam , has furnished its readers and the American public with the unvarnished facts on Vietnam , started to worry and kept asking Halberstam ' what it was- all about . Ifalberstani , who was ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police beat him up , cabled back that if there were any more questions about " that woman 's copy . . . I resign , repeat , resign . " In its October 11 issue Time reviews the controversy . The correspondents , it finds , are " somewhat on the young side , energetic , ambitious , convivial , in love with their work . " But this " tightly knit " group tends to be " severely critical of practically everything " ? which could be , of course , because there was practically nothing that any conscientious reporter could be happy about . What they reported about the course of the war " was seriously questioned in Washington " ? although what they wrote about the deterioration of the Diem government was , regrettably , true . So now Washington , which a while ago was culpably manipulating the news , is invoked by Time to suggest that the fellows in South Vietnam , between harassments , wire tappings , , lying handouts and beatings , are the ones who are misleading the American public ! This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a little more subtle than , - the , Sylvester type , is hardly less detestable from the standpoint of honest journalism .
