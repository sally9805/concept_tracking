THE 21 top American businessmen , journeying on a trip arranged by Time Inc. , had spent long days and longer evenings being briefed , being lectured to , having their questions answered , and being feted in Washington , London and Moscow . Now they were in Berlin , and would have their first two-hour free period next morning , to sightsee , to rest , to do as they like . But one of them had a proposal to make : Why not spend the time talking out their impressions of all the people they had met , from Kennedy to Khrushchev , and the arguments they had heard ? The matter was put to a vote . Unanimously , they agreed to use their free time to compare notes . <P> It was that kind of group , and one that realized that they had shared an unparalleled experience together . Last week they had more of it-in Germany , dinner with Chancellor Erhard , lunch with ex-Chancellor Adenauer . In Paris , lunch with French Premier Pompidou , a dinner with " Mr. Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a picked group of Common Market Eurocrats . By now the businessmen , whose questioning of experts had been diffident at first , had become forthright . When the Common Market 's Vice Chairman Robert Marjolin , a Yale-educated French Social ist , called for questions , he was asked : " Why should a bunch of American capitalists put their trust in a bunch of Socialist Eurocrats ? " <P> Marjolin answered : " I was n't aware that you had put your trust in us . " <P> There was laughter and applause . Actually , that exchange did not truly reflect the feelings of the occasion , for when called upon to ask the evening 's final question , Walter H. Wheeler Jr. , chairman of Pitney-Bowes , made a statement instead : Marjolin &; Co. were receiving a lot of criticism these days , but what Wheeler had seen in Brussels was the most hopeful and inspiring experience of the whole trip , and he thought that the Common Market was doing the right thing both for Europe and the world . <P> This remark brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the U.S. corporation heads . <P> As the 10,600-mile trip came to an end , one of the executives picked up the day 's copy of the New York Times and was pleased to note that in the previous three days , he had talked to five of the world leaders who were making Page One news . <P> LAST May 31 , when our cover L carried the pictures of twelve leading U.S. executives , we predicted that this would cause great difficulty for the growing number of readers who collect the autographs of cover subjects . To get all twelve signatures onto one cover , we thought , through a series of mailings , might even take years . Reader Howard Lawrence of Inglewood , Calif. , who with his wife has been collecting TIME autographs since the Jimmy Byrnes man-of-the-year cover in 1947 , writes us triumphantly that he now-after many delays-has rounded up all twelve . One of the difficult ones to get , he reports , was who was then vice chairman and is now president of the Bank of America . Peterson was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moscow trip , and Khrushchev , too , found him an amiably deliberate fellow .
