PROPERTY RIGHTS <P> How much of a sculptor 's skill lies in the dexterity of his hands , how much in the depths of his imagination ? Those art-seminar questions are now the very practical concern of a Paris court . At issue are 32 works of sculpture that came out of the atelier of the great French impressionist painter Auguste Renoir shortly before his death half a century ago . In a suit seeking to win rights as " co-author , " a Spanish-born sculptor named Richard Guino , 78 , is arguing that his were the hands that really shaped the Renoir masterpieces . <P> No one disputes Guino 's astonishing claim . In Paris in 1913 , the 23-year-old Guino was asked to help Renoir work at his new interest - sculpting . Crippled by rheumatism and a stroke , the ailing 72-year-old painter was barely able to hold a brush , let alone handle sculp tor 's clay . So , under Renoir 's strict and detailed supervision , the young Guino executed the artist 's conceptions . The collaboration continued for four fruitful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renoir attached his name to the works ; Guino settled for a small fee and an anonymous association with genius . <P> Special Bonus . Now white-thatched and ailing , Guino says that his belated suit grew out of " economic necessity and a desire for justice . " Only the " exceptional relationship between two great artists , " Guino 's lawyer told the court , " made possible the miracle of Renoir-Guino sculpture . " As recompense , he demanded nothing less than 50% of the royalties from all statue reproductions , past and future . <P> Defending Renoir 's estate were his two sons , Cinema Director Jean ( La Grande Illusion ) and Ceramist Coco , and his grandson , Cameraman Claude . They contended that the Spaniard was merely a competent craftsman . " For there to be true co-authorship , " argued the Renoirs ' attorneys , " the law insists upon common inspiration and mutual control . Obviously in this case there was neither . " Besides , the lawyers said , Guino has already received something of an added bonus-the family sponsored his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do a bust for the grave . <P> Artistic Critique . Despite the defense 's attempt to portray Guino as more chiseler than sculptor , the three-man tribunal listened sympathetically to his case . With obvious admiration , Chief Judge Paul Mouzon studied two Guino statuettes displayed in court . And when the courtroom debate finally ended , he asked Paris Art Dealer Alfred Daber to spend up to six months studying the essential question : Do the disputed works bear Guino 's " personal stamp , even a modest one , " or can they be considered " as belonging entirely to Auguste Renoir in spite of Guino 's skill and dexterity " ? The final decision will presumably be based on Daber 's artistic critique .
