The color pictures and charts that begin on the opposite page tell the remarkable story of a jetliner 's nonstop flight across the U.S. Oddly enough , one of the remarkable things about the flight was that it was not remarkable at all . The TWA 707 took off from Los Angeles International Airport , soared smoothly across the nation , landed at New York 's John F. Kennedy Airport . No hitches , no nervous moments , no bother . And therein lies an even more remarkable story-a story that involves 14,000 highly trained and dedicated men who work with some of the most complex and sophisticated electronic apparatus ever devised . <P> Even before Flight 740 began taxiing toward the runway at Los Angeles , it was under the surveillance and guidance of the Federal Aviation Agency . Careful eyes watched the plane turn at the end of the runway , poise , and then reach for the sky . Flight 740 then became a bright , moving blip on a succession of FAA radarscopes as it was guided along a transcontinental airway . <P> Golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one segment of the FAA 's 350,000-mile network of federal airways , freeways of the sky that are complete with aerial versions of warning signs , access roads , directional guides and even parking places-the holding areas in the vicinity of busy airports . With the help of ground controllers , pilots navigate from point to point along these invisible airways by means of electronic navigational aids that provide course , distance and location information . These " navaids " range from small location-marker beacons on the ground that light a bulb on the aircraft 's instrument panel as it passes overhead , to huge , long-range radar systems that track aircraft and are linked to distant air-traffic control centers by microwave . <P> Like the highways below them , the nation 's airways are becoming increasingly congested . At any moment during daylight hours , the FAA estimates , there are between 8,000 and 9,000 planes aloft in the U.S. airspace , as many as 4,000 of them in the " Golden Triangle , " formed by lines connecting Chicago , New York and Washington . With 1,000 new planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the traffic jams are becoming increasingly heavy-both in the sky and at airports . Of the 9,500 U.S. airports , only 114 can handle jets . And although the FAA estimates that the number of jet airports will increase to 346 by 1970 and to more than 500 by 1975 , their added capacity will not fully relieve the growing pressure or end the flight delays at such busy fields as Chicago 's O'Hare , Los Angeles ' International and New York 's John F. Kennedy airports . <P> Over the next decade , the agency estimates , landings and takeoffs at airports controlled by FAA towers will triple-from more than 41 million in 1966 to 139 million . During the same interval , the annual number of flights by instrument rules will grow from 5.2 million to 12.4 million . The number of U.S. commercial airliners will increase from 2,124 to 3,500 . Airline business will soar from 114 million passengers and 76 billion passenger-miles in 1966 to 352 million passengers and 266 billion passenger-miles in 1977 . The general aviation fleet of business and pleasure craft will increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
