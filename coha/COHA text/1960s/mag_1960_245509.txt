Somewhere in the Russian hinterland last week a giant rocket hurled aloft a five-ton spaceship containing two dogs named Pchelka ( Little Bee ) and Mushka ( Little Fly ) , a quantity of other unspecified plants and animals , and myriad electronic gadgets for keeping radio tab on the passengers . <P> It was the third of its kind . The first , launched last May with a dummy astronaut aboard , went out of control and was not recovered . Cosmic Ship II , launched in August with animal passengers , was safely lowered to earth , and Nikita Khrushchev boasted that the launching was " a step to man 's flight into space . " To a newsman 's question why Cosmic III weighed 82 Ibs. less than Cosmic II , Khrushchev replied : " It 's big enough for a man to eat his dinner inside . " It was also roughly twice the size of the biggest satellite that the U.S. has yet managed to fire into orbit . <P> But Cosmic III was soon in trouble . Allied trackers around the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles above the earth at its apogee , 111.94 miles at its perigee ) was the lowest yet assumed by any satellite , Russian or American , and dangerously close to the upper atmosphere . After the spaceship had made 18 revolutions around the earth , U.S. and British trackers suddenly lost contact with it . <P> <P> Hours later , Tass conceded that Cosmic III had gone astray . When the signal was given for the return of the spaceship satellite to earth , " the spaceship descended along a noncalculated trajectory " and " burned up on entering the dense layers of the atmosphere . " <P> In the usual manner of space publicists , the Russian scientists insisted that , before the burnout , " the planned program " had been accomplished and " the information obtained yielded new data for manned space flight in the near future .
