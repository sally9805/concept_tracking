txt Dr. Charles Hurst , 44. president since February of what now is Chicago City colleges Malcolm X campus , said yesterday the campus this autumn will drop all entrance requirements and stop issuing failing grades . He said faculty members of the college branch , formerly the Crane campus , have agreed to his plan for a two-year experiment in which no student is to receive a grade lower than a " C " in any course . Can Continue Studies Any student whose work does not warrant at least a " C " will be given an " incomplete " rating and will be allowed to continue his studies as long as he wants to do so , Dr. Hurst said . He said the system will prevent students from becoming discouraged or hampered by a bad academic record if they later improve their study habits or become more motivated .

He said the curriculum will involve study of all cultures which are in the United States and would benefit a student with any background . However , Dr. Hurst said , the curriculum generally Will be aimed at instilling pride and dignity in blacks because they will comprise most of the students and because Negroes are the nation 's largest minority and face the most problems .
