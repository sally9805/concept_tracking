January 11 , 1966 was rather a red-letter day in German industrial history . For the first time since the gigantic Krupp empire was founded a century and a half ago , Krupp shares were sold on the public market . <P> Not , to be sure , many shares : those listed for sale represented only $9,000,000 of the total $143 million equity of Fried . Krupp Httenwerke A.G. , a recently organized coal-and-steel subsidiary that forms only a fraction of the Krupp holdings . Each of the preferred shares issued at a par value of 100 German marks ( $25 ) carried a guaranteed annual dividend of at least 10% for the next 10 years . With such a sweetener tagged on , the Krupp shares opened at $39.75 on the West German exchanges , and at week 's end were selling for $45.25 . <P> For Alfried Felix Alwyn Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach , 58 , fifth-generation ruler of the Krupp empire , last week 's dilution of ownership , no matter how tiny , could only signify changing times in a life that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family 's industrial throne in 1943 , the word Krupp was synonymous with armaments . The Krupp plants produced the weapons that helped Hitler ravage Europe ; by the end of World War II most of the Krupp factories lay in ruins , pounded into rubble by Allied bombers , and Alfried Krupp himself was sentenced to twelve years in prison for employing slave labor in his factories . Krupp was released in 1951 , after serving only half his sentence ; at that time he pledged that he would never again make another gun or another bullet . <P> Krupp has kept that pledge ; the closest his complex now comes to providing the instruments of war is in its production of trucks and transport planes for the West German Bundeswehr . Patiently rebuilding from defeat , Krupp diversified to the extent that Krupp-owned concerns now turn out not only locomotives , aircraft , huge bucket dredgers and machine tools but even mineral water and orchids . Last year Krupp sales amounted to well over $1 billion , thus proving the point made by one of Alfried 's corporate aides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> To finance further expansion and diversification , Krupp has recently needed ready cash-and raised a quick $27 million by selling shares to several West German banks ; they agreed not to sell their Krupp shares until the presently depressed market for German coal and steel stocks improves . Last week 's public offering also symbolized a growing recognition that one-man , head-of-the-family control over the empire may end with Alfried Krupp himself . His son Arndt , 28 , the heir apparent , one of the swiftest of Western Europe 's jet set , does not have an intense interest in business affairs . Already there have been suggestions that when Alfried Krupp steps aside , the Krupp holdings be placed in a family trust administered by a Krupp-dominated board .
