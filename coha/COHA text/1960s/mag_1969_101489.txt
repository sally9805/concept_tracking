The damage to Hill 's knees was extensive . He will be in hip-to-toe casts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such pain that morphine has been insufficient  --  he has been receiving regular injections of heroin .

Pompidou did observe protocol recently by inviting the diplomatic corps to the first pheasant hunt of the season , but he loaded his guests into a police bus in the morning and kept them hard at it until 4 , skipping lunch . General de Gaulle used to be more formal , serving a breakfast of coffee and croissants , after which his guests made their way to Rambouillet in their own chauffeur-driven cars , if they had them , or in cars provided by de Gaulle , if they did not .
