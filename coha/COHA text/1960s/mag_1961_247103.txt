King of Kings ( Samuel Bronston ; M-G-M ) . Christianity , which has survived the Turkish onslaught and the Communist conspiracy , may even survive this picture ; but individual Christians who try to sit through it may find themselves longing for extreme unction . <P> A remake of Cecil B. DeMille 's 1927 life of Christ . King of Kings was produced in Spain by a marked-down DeMille named Samuel Bronston who built 396 sets , hired some 20,000 extras and a dozen slightly famous players , spent more than four months and $8,000.000 . And what emerged ? Incontestably the corniest , phoniest , ickiest and most monstrously vulgar of all the big Bible stories Hollywood has told in the last decade . Nevertheless , the subject is so dear to the hearts of millions that King of Kings will undoubtedly be filling Hollywood 's collection plates for months to come . Scheduled for reserved-seat. pre-Christmas release at fancy prices ( $1.50-$3.50 on Broadway ) , the film will soon be playing in 26 cities from Los Angeles to Rome , has rung up an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Fortunately . Bronston 's bust enjoys one solid virtue : a script precisely organized and competently prosed by Playwright Philip ( Anna Lucasta ) Yordan. who has often quite sensitively reconciled the grandeurs of the King James version with the need for a fresh , contemporary tone . After noisily establishing the Romans in Palestine . Scenarist Yordan moves swiftly and synoptically through the Gospels : The Nativity , The Flight into Egypt . The Massacre of the Innocents ; Christ 's boyhood , baptism and temptation in the desert ; Salome 's Dance and the murder of John the Baptist ; the Sermon on the Mount , the triumphal procession to Jerusalem , the Last Supper , the Agony in the Garden , the Trial before Pilate , the Ascent of Calvary , the Crucifixion , the Resurrection . Unfortunately , many of these episodes are shamelessly scanted and most of Christ 's miracles-certainly the most dramatic moments of his ministry-are inexplicably omitted . The time thus saved is devoted to two bombinating battles that never actually took place ; to a wildly unhistorical subplot that exaggerates Barabbas ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of George Washington of the Jews , and makes Judas merely a bewildered Benedict Arnold ; to a number of incidents in the life of Christ - among them a dramatic death-cell confrontation with John the Baptist-that are nowhere sanctioned by scripture and invariably ring false . <P> Director Nicholas Ray makes few positive contributions . With his customary penchant for the pretentious ( Johnny Guitar ) , he slushes up the sound track with angel voices-all , as usual , soprano , apparently on the theory that only girls are nice enough to be angels : he fancy-pants around with his camera in a ludicrous gilt-plaster palace that looks as if it were made of baroque-candy ; and he ever-so-reverently overdresses his hovel scenes till they gloom and glow like cheap reproductions of Murillo.
