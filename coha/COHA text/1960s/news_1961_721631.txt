txt A team of surgeons at the University of M ississip pi medical center used electricity today to anesthetize a woman as simply as turning on an electric light . Within a minute after the switch was turned off after the operation . the woman awoke and expressed ' no discomfort . In addition , she had no nausea and was retprned immediately to her room instead of to a recovery room where she ordinarily would have spent considerable time under constant supervision . First in Nation Hospital authorities said the use of the electrical anesthesia was the first in the nation , and possibly in the ' world . The use of electrical anesthesia was developed at the center after four years of re search under a grant from the department of the army , which is particularly interested because of the equip , ment 's potential for operations under combat conditions . The system  --  costing $150 ? works like this : An oscillator , or frequency generator , provides 700 cycles of current thru an amplifier which is connected to the patient 's temple by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seconds Within 30 to 60 seconds after the switch is thrown , the patient is asleep and the operation may begin . T h e patient remains unconscious as long as the current is on and wakes up within 30 to 60 seconds after the current is turned off . A hospital spokesman said a 700 cycle signal  --  compared with 60 cycles used in house current ? was . chosen after months of research on dogs and monkeys . Interests the Army It is the quick recovery that interests the army because it eliminates elaborate facilities in the field . Surgeons said patients under electrical anesthesia still must undergo the usual pre-anesthetic medication . A major change is that the airway tube in the throat ? essential in all operations to prevent strangulation  --  is inserted while the patient is awake .
