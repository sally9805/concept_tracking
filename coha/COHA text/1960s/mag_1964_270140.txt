Harakiri . Kneeling in starched white death robes on a mat in the sacred garden , the desperate young warrior strips himself bare to the waist . He seizes a short sword , plunges it into his abdomen once . Twice . Three times . Four . He falls over the gory weapon . " Behead me ! " he pleads , but before the last merciful blow is delivered he has bitten off his tongue . <P> In that grisly , excruciatingly detailed study of a samurai 's ritual suicide , Japanese Director Masaki Kobayashi sets the theme of a 17th century tragedy on honor in death-and the death of honor . The victims are two ronin , or unemployed samurai left to starve when their lordly masters are disfranchised following a civil war . <P> The samurai code of honor breaks down when they present themselves in turn at the household of one Lord lyi , begging for " a corner of the porch " on which to commit harakiri-a sham heroism often used by ronin to draw out an offer of a job . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , largely as a diversion for the courtly company , a seasoned old fighter Tsugumo ( Tatsuya Nakadai ) arrives seeking vegeance . The Tragedy unfolds austerely in flashbacks framed by Tsugumo 's rather wordy debate with Lord Iyi 's chief retainer , whose ridgid adherence to a feudal military system is summed up by the phrase : " In time of peace , ther is no hope . " <P> Though Harakiri may sometimes try the patience of an Occidental moviegoer , the film 's best scenes lift it to the stature of an astringent minor classic . Director Kobayashi softens violence with impeccable artistry . In his hands , the grim ancient ritual of self-immolation seems as rigidly formalized and strangely beatiful as any of the lethal arts , bullfighting for example . And Tsugumo 's climactic battle with the palace elite guard , as intricately choreographed as a kabuki dance , provides in one swift scene an unforgettable splash of blood , boldness and cinematic bravura .
