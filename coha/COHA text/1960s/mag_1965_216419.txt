Nothing , in Soviet doctrine , is much more reactionary than Christmas , combining as it does " bourgeois " religion with capitalist commercialism . But the New Year is something else again . For years , the Communists have emphasized this ideologically safer holiday while downgrading or disguising Christmas ( which in the Russian calendar falls on Jan. 7 ) . With beaming approval from the Krernlin , Moscow last week was feverishly preparing for the biggest , brassiest and most bountiful New Year 's blowout in Communist history . <P> On sale throughout Moscow were 325,000 freshly cut Siberian fir yolki ( formerly Christmas but now New Year 's trees ) , plus another 100,000 artificial trees and 200 boxcars of tinsel , lights and colored balls . Lavishly decorated trees appeared by the hundreds in restaurants , shops , public buildings and even in the Kremlin 's Tainitsky Garden . State stores advertised " everything for the New Year 's tree . " On the streets , resplendent in long white beards and bright red suits , dozens of Grandfather Frosts exacted kopeks from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gifts-thanks to the Kremlin 's ever-increasing emphasis on consumer goods . In record numbers they jammed into department stores , shops and the barnlike discount houses called " market halls . " Fifty new stores opened this month for the holiday season . In the huge but usually drab GUM department store , counters were piled high with everything from Winter Fantasy perfume ( $4.44 an ounce ) and 400 kinds of watches to luxury food baskets at only $57 . To cope with a turnover of hall-a-million customers and $11.5 million in sales during the holiday week , GUM reported that it had sharply increased its sales staff from a few hundred to nearly 3,000 . Moscow 's new twelve-story post office initiated helicopter service to try to deliver greeting cards , most of them bearing the same printed inscription : S Novym Godom ( Happy New Year ) . <P> To add to the liquidity of the season , the Kremlin has lifted the midnight liquor curfew , and on New Year 's Eve Muscovites can get oiled until a highly reactionary 5 a.m . Hotels , coffeehouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are booked solid and have laid on massive spreads ( $13.75 a plate at the Moskva restaurant ) and lavish shows ( seven different dance bands at the Ukraine ) . For home celebrators , 8,000 tons of fresh fruit and 1,000,000 bottles of Crimean champagne and wine have been shipped to the capital 's markets , and a new state catering service called " Spring " advertised in Vechernaya Moskva that it was available for private parties , formal or informal . <P> The spirit of 5 Novym Godom even extended to Nikita Khrushchev . Reportedly , the deposed Chairman has been granted the handsome pension of $660 a month-twice what top Soviet functionaries normally receive-and has been allowed to keep his chauffeur driven Chaika limousine .
