txt WASHINGTON , Dec. 22 ? The Israeli Government has now officially denied that it has other than peaceful purposes for the nuclear reactor it is building , with the assistance of France , in secrecy so deep that United States intelligence was led to believe the installation was a textile plant . Because of this secrecy , and much more because the reactor 's weapons capability could spark new hostilities in the Near East , the Washington Government has welcomed proof of Israeli professions of peaceful intent . It is now expected here that Israel will make its reactor accessible to the safeguards system of the International Atomic Energy Agency which recently concluded its fourth conference at Vienna . This system , under which Chairman McCone of the United States commission offered to place four specific research and power reactors , provides for adequate international inspection to assure that atomic installations , represented as designed for wholly peaceful use , are not diverted to the production of nuclear weaponry . " * * * The consequences of improper or careless handling of the atom in one country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have serious consequences in the next . Hence it is vital that this Agency * " press forward with its work in the " * safe design and operation of critical assemblies , research reactors and power reactors * * It will not " press forward " to these goals unless its non-Communist members join the United States in placing such installations as Israel 's under Agency safeguards existing and proposed . Israel is one of these members , and voted for the safeguards system . The history of the secret nuclear reactor in that country begins substantially in September , 1957 . In a report prepared by Mr. and Mrs. Leon H. Keyserling , and issued by the Israel Bond Association to help promote its campaign for American investment in the bonds of the new nation , this appeared : " Israel 's scientists have been undertaking intensive study of the manufacture of heavy water and of the possible extraction of uranium from phosphates mined in the Negev . But although nuclear power utilization at a cost which would warrant its use may be as much as fifteen or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this potential . " The next item In the record is a July 4 , 1960 , announcement from Tel Aviv that Israel 's " first atomic reactor , " intended mainly for research with a future generating capacity of 5,000 kilowatts , was in operation . To this the United States had contributed fuel . Not until months later , however , did longrange photographs , of another construction which the United States had been informed was a textile plant , supply strong indications that this was a nuclear reactor with weapons capability . On Dec. 9 Administration officials called a meeting which members of the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy attended . They were told that the installation in all likelihood was not a research plant at all , but of the natural uranium fuel type that can be used to produce plutonium for weapons as well as electricity . There followed official inquiries of Israel by the United States , confirmation that the plant was as indicated by the photographs , , but strong verbal assure nces that it would be confined wholly to , peaceful uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " necessary precautions " to make certain its aid would be so used by Israel before providing it . But , because of the deception practiced , these representations did not wholly allay the suspicions of the United States . And there have been two other inevitable consequences . The Arab world is agitated with alarm over the possibility of an Israel armed with nuclear weapons . And the Soviets have seized a perfect opportunity to foment the trouble both ways : by playing on Israeli nationalism , to which it pretends to believe the United States has given just offense ; and by arousing the Arabs . But Israel too has a perfect opportunity  --  for a constructive action which will cancel the damage and Moscow 's effort to increase it . Israel can conform to the spirit of Chairman McCone 's offer at Vienna by placing under the present and future safeguards of the Agency the reactor it is building . That would assist in the pursuit of world peace the United States , the nation which has given the most generous assistance to Israel 's economy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
