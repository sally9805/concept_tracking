Naturalists have noticed for at least a century that insects have a way of mimicking each other . Butterflies of two species not closely related often show similar patterns of bright colors . Generations of entomologists have suspected that nature thus protects a butterfly that birds consider delicious by enabling it to resemble one that is distasteful to birds-but this theory has been widely debated and rarely tested experimentally . In Natural History , Biologists Lincoln P. and Jane Van Zandt Brower of Amherst College settle at least part of the argument about the survival value of nature 's insect masquerade . <P> Instead of working with butterflies , the Drs . Brower selected two insects , the bumblebee and the robber fly , that are very distantly related but look very much alike . Both are covered with light and dark fur ; both have hairy legs and buzz . <P> The robber fly even has bunches of light hair on its hind legs to resemble the baskets of pollen that the bumblebee usually carries . The big difference between the two : the bee can sting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoned that the robber fly 's beelike appearance protects it from predators that fear the sting of real bumblebees . <P> To prove this theory , they put toads in cages and offered them live dragonflies , bumblebees and robber flies . Inexperienced toads accepted all three alike , but toads that grabbed the bees got stung . Once stung , they would eat neither bumblebees nor robber flies , though the flies , in spite of their appearance , could not sting them . <P> The Drs . Brower believe that this experiment proves the survival value of mimicry for insects that are able to make themselves sound , look or act like less attractive relatives . But they think that the robber fly may get a second advantage from its resemblance to the bumblebee . <P> Something of an ingrate , it enjoys eating its bumblebee benefactors , which it grabs from behind and stabs with paralyzing mandibles . The doctors suspect that bumblebees mistake their look-alike enemies for their own kind , thus make less effort to avoid them .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
