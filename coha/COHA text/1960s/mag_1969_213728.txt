During a practice session seven years ago , the Chicago Black Hawks ' Stan Mi-kita split the flat , straight blade of his hockey stick into a haphazard V-shape . <P> Without pausing to change sticks , Mi-kita continued playing and to his sur prise found that he could rip off a shot faster and harder with his crooked cud gel . Soon he and Teammate Bobby Hull were warping the wooden blades of their sticks into scooplike curves by soaking them in hot water and wedging them under door jambs overnight . <P> Changing the Style . While some rival players scoffed at the " silly sticks , " the fact that Mikita and Hull developed into the most potent one-two scoring combination in hockey induced many other pros to experiment with the new blades . Now more than half of the players in the National Hockey League are using the bowed blades , ranging from the slight bend favored by the Detroit Red Wings ' Gordie Howe to the severe 1-in. hook of Mikita 's " banana stick . " The innovation , comparable to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tennis , has revved up the pace of hockey and changed the entire style of play . <P> The New York Rangers ' Rod Gilbert , for example , explains that from his right-wing position " with a straight stick and a fast play the shot will slide off my stick like a golfer 's slice . But with the curved stick I can hold the puck a second longer , have better control when I fake the goalie , and then whip it into the corner with the left-hand spin and know it wo n't trail off . " Other players say that the sickle stick helps them to scoop the puck off the boards and , by cradling it inside the curve , shield it from the goalie 's vision . This new-found control , which is roughly similar to that afforded by the lacrosse stick or the jai-alai cesta , has worked wonders for such so-so scorers as Ranger Vic Hadfield , who has already scored more goals this season than he has in seven previous seasons in the N.H.L. <P> The biggest advantage of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the element of surprise . I can pull the puck in and shoot it all in one motion before the goaltender knows I 'm shooting . The hook hugs the puck , and I can get a little action on it . It 'll drop or rise , and I know which way it 's going by the way I follow through . " <P> Shots at Spectators . Though Hull swears by the curved sticks , more than a few players swear at them . The " little action " Hull refers to is a certain spin given to the puck that makes it dip-sydoodle through the air like a knuckleball , fluttering and dropping as much as 18 in. - at 100-plus m.p.h . For the hapless goalie , says Toronto Maple Leaf Coach Punch Imlach , fielding these unguided missiles is " like standing up at the plate while a baseball pitcher without control throws dust-off pitches at your head . " <P> The Los Angeles Kings ' Wayne Rutledge says that " the big curve should be outlawed , and goalies should go on strike to see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago 's Dave Dryden feels that at the very least goalies should be equipped with their own curved sticks . " That way , " he says ruefully , " we can fire the puck back at them . "
