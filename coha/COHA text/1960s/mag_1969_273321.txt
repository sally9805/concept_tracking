HIGH federal office often brings fame to a man and , once he returns to private life , fortune as well . The successful businessman or professional entering Government service , however , may draw an official salary that is far less than the sum he is accustomed to paying in taxes . That is particularly true for many of Richard Nixon 's Cabinet appointees , an uncommonly successful lot . <P> All twelve department heads get the same pay : $35,000 a year plus such perquisites as the use of a limousine . Yet to become Secretary of State , William Rogers is giving up an income in the $300,000 range , derived from his law practice and his limited partnership in the Dreyfus Fund . David Kennedy ( Treasury ) has been earning more than $230,000 a year , plus stock options , as chairman of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co . Maurice Stans ( Commerce ) has been grossing about $250,000 as president of the investment-banking firm of Glore Forgan , William R. Staats , Inc. , and as a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney General ) has been earning more than $200,000 . Winton Blount ( Postmaster General ) is the nonsalaried president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , but his Alabama-based construction company has had contracts this year involving more than $100 million . He says his personal income has been " several times " $35,000 . <P> <P> A Raise in Salary . Blount , of course , will unload his interest in the family company . So will another millionaire builder , Governor John Volpe of Massachusetts , who will head the Transportation Department . Volpe retained his chairmanship of the John A. Volpe Construction Co. while serving as Governor . He will sell his interest , which he estimates at about $1,000,000 , and expects to lose a quarter of that in taxes . <P> The third contractor in the Cabinet , Walter Hickel ( Interior ) , put his private holdings , worth an estimated $14 million , into trusteeship after being elected Governor of Alaska in 1966 . Even if Cabinet salaries are not increased , Hickel stands to get a raise ; the Governor of Alaska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mansion in Juneau . Michigan pays its Governor $40,000 , so George Romney ( Housing and Urban Development ) will be taking a $5,000 cut . Romney 's personal holdings are estimated at $1,500,000 , and have been in trust since he left American Motors to enter politics in 1962 . <P> Even the two educators in the crowd face cuts in remuneration . George Shultz says that he will be making a " very substantial sacrifice " when he resigns as Dean of the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business to become Secretary of Labor . He will also have to give up income from directorships of Borg-Warner , the General American Transportation Co. , and the Stein , Roe and Farnham funds . To become Secretary of Agriculture , Clifford Hardin will receive the same base pay of $35,000 that he has been drawing as Chancellor of the University of Nebraska , but he loses his free residence .
