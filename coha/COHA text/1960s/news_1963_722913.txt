Black , chief engineer for the park district , said the sagging of the garage floor and the pavement resulted from a leak in a fire line carrying water beneath the floor of the garage , which washed away surrounding earth . Workmen began shoring up the pillars supporting the pavement . Black said that the section of the garage affected , with spaces for about 260 cars , will be closed indefinitely . City engineers were drilling cores out of the damaged section to determine the extent of the washout . The garage was closed and 250 autos were driven away , most of them by garage attendants who refused to let drivers enter the stricken area .
