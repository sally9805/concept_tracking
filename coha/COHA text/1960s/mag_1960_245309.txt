After a photographer 's apprenticeship in Boston , Armenian-born Yousuf Karsh set up his own portrait studio in Ottawa because he yearned to photograph prominent men . Now a courtly 51 , Karsh of Ottawa is as renowned as most of his subjects . Last week the Canadian capital paid the world 's foremost portrait photographer the unusual compliment of an exhibition at the National Gallery . <P> The exhibition is Karsh 's gallery of greatness-portraits of the 74 statesmen , artists , poets , scientists and philosophers , from the legions he has photographed , whom Karsh considers most qualified by their " concern and love for fellowman . " He winnowed the number from his own wider selection of 96 world leaders in his best-selling ( 41,000 copies at $17.50 ) Portraits of Greatness , which was published last winter . Sir Winston Churchill alone still appears twice-in the celebrated 1942 defiant portrait that Karsh achieved by audaciously snitching the grumpy Churchill 's cigar from his mouth , and in a 1955 elder statesman pose . " Sir Winston is the greatest man in a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera has missed few of the greatest of the past 25 years , and he still flies as much as 80,000 miles a year keeping up with the non-Joneses . " I really hate work , " he says , " but what keeps a photographer good and modest is his dedication to his work . " Last August Karsh was just sitting down with a dinner party of illustrious scientists and educators in his home , near Ottawa , when he received a call from Washington . " There were enough brains in my home to have split an atom . But I had to get my picture . " Karsh excused himself , hurried to Washington , where he had appointments to photograph Vice President Nixon and Democratic Presidential Candidate Jack Kennedy . Nixon missed the sitting , but Karsh expects to return to do him within the next fortnight . Since the U.S. conventions , he has also photographed Vice-Presidential Candidates Henry Cabot Lodge and Lyndon Johnson . <P> " My technique is one of pure simplicity , " says Karsh . " I generate so much enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this enthusiasm . " Actually it is not that simple . He arms himself with extensive research on the habits , mannerisms and quirks of his subject . " I live in utter agony after I have taken the picture . I know there are so many things I could have done to make it better , but I am exhausted . " His fees : $600 in the U.S. , $200 for Ottawans , $300 for anyone who comes from elsewhere to Ottawa . <P> As a portraitist , Karsh readily discusses his favorite portraits-his Helen Keller , Hemingway , and Hammarskjold , besides the famous Churchill-but declines to nominate his best in the conviction that he has not yet taken it . " Perhaps , " he says , " tomorrow . "
