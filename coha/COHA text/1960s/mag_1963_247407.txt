Italy 's sensational consumer economy has soared to new heights-but Italian bankers and economists worry that it has risen on the wings of butterflies . " Butterflies " is the Italian nickname for cambiali , the instant-credit promissory notes that flit from one holder to an other through Italy 's credit-happy economy . No one knows for sure the exact value of the cambiali now in circulation in Italy , but knowledgeable bankers estimate that their worth may equal the total value of Italy 's currency . Cambiali have become so much a part of Italian life that Cinema Director Vittorio De Sica has just produced a movie - fittingly called // Boom-in which a young husband sells his right eye to get money to honor the cambiali he has signed to please his greedy wife . <P> Final Roost . The cambiali look like ordinary U.S. bank checks-but the resemblance ends there . In Italy 's consumer boom , the buyer of a refrigerator or bedroom set signs a promissory note for each monthly installment . He thus may sign as many as 48 cambiali for one TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods uses the cambiali to pay his own bills , just as if they were currency , and his supplier or landlord in turn uses them to pay off his debts . The notes may pass through 20 or more hands before they finally roost in a bank for collection . If the bank-which makes its profit on cambiali by discounting them by 2% to 12%-has trouble collecting from the original signer , it applies a dreaded remedy . Unless the delinquent pays up , the bank publishes his name in the Bollettino dei Protesti , a kind of debtors ' Who 's Who , and also begins court proceedings to recover the loss . <P> <P> What bothers the Italian financial community is that so many of the cambiali end up in the collector 's hands . <P> <P> By signing the cambiali with abandon to finance everything from furs to apartments , thousands upon thousands of Italians have run up staggering debts . Nearly every day the Italian press discovers another case of someone obli gated to pay out more monthly on cambiali than he actually earns . Almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poverty-stricken Sicilians and the migrants to the rich north , who are dazzled by luxury goods and modern household appliances . Last year 8,160,546 cambiali were dishonored , 10% more than in 1961 . <P> Shot Down . Italy 's financial men consider cambiali a strong inflationary force , believe that they have helped to bring Italy to the verge of serious economic crisis . Cambiali have already pushed up Italian wages and living costs and have sparked a consumer buying spree that has led many Italian businessmen to forget about exports in order to sell more at home . The result is that Italy 's trade deficit has nearly doubled , from $748 million for the first seven months last year to $1.3 billion for the same period this year . <P> Interim Premier Giovanni Leone 's recent attempt to curb credit was shot down by the right , left and center , since no party is willing to incur the wrath of legions of cambiali signers . But unless Italy soon brings its credit binge under control , its economic miracle could , like a butterfly , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
