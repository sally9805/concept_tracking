" As the campaign develops , " said the New York Times in an editorial that was published the morning after President Johnson 's nomination in Atlantic City , " the points of difference between Mr. Johnson and Mr. Goldwater will become increasingly apparent . " But the Times could n't wait for developments . With uncharacteristic haste , it cast its vote for Lyndon Baines Johnson even before the 1964 presidential campaign had begun . <P> The differences between the two candidates , said the Times , which has been lamenting Barry Goldwater 's candidacy as a blow to national prestige , " are clear enough already . In our opinion , they point to an inescapably logical conclusion : the necessity of electing Lyndon Johnson as President of the United States and of administering a decisive and definitive defeat to the voices of the past . " <P> A similar stance came from Pundit Walter Lippmann , who has previously characterized Goldwater 's policies as " insanity . " Wrote Lippmann last week : " Sen. Goldwater has certainly achieved what he said he was trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not an echo . In this election there is a clear choice . It is between Goldwater and Miller on the one hand and Johnson and Humphrey on the other hand . Some choice . "
