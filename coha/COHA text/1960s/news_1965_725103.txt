txt The controversy surrea early this year by the San Francisco National Bank 's sudden failure may prove mild cornoared with what 's to come . It 's not that the furor created by the bank 's collapse has n't been in the news . Last January 's abrupt closing of the bank  --  opened only three years before  --  already has touched off a Senate investigation and led to indictment of the bank 's president on 79 counts of criminal violation of national banking laws . But new evidence , likely to be made public in bits and pieces in the weeks ahead , may point up these startling and hitherto unpublicized facets of the failure : One , the enormity of the failure and of potential losses to depositors . Over the past 30 years . depositors in banks that xt toe closed on the average recouped 95t1 of their funds from the assets of the closed banks . But private indications from Government sources are that more than $30 nullion , or of San Francisco National 's assets ? valued at S54 million on paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or otherwise placed beyond immediate chance of recovery by creditors . Two . the extent of Uncle Sam 's role in the unsuccessful effort to keep the faltering bank alive . It is finally becoming clear that Government officials took an active part in attempting to secure large deposits for the bank and otherwi.:e tried to compensate for mismanagement ? in one case . allegedly golag so far as to withhold from the Justice Department evidence of criminal violations of Federal law Even if the activities of the Government offi  --  ials prove legally justified  --  and they ate being tested in court  --  the situation is casting considerable doubt about the effectiveness of the nation 's bank regulatory system . Many San Francisco National depta , ators question in just whose interest this regulatory authority was being used . They charge that it was directed at helping allegedly fraudulent management out of a tight spot , rather than at informing and protecting depositors and the general public . No Report Yet From FDIC The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp ? the Government agency that is liquidating the bank , has yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months after the closing . and it may not make one before the end of the year . if at all . But figures , made available show that the FDIC has been able to raise no more than $20.500,000 in cash or Government bonds from bank assets that , on paper at least , were valued at $54 million . Of that amount , about $15 million already is pledged to secured creditors  --  principally the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco . which had advanced the ailing institution $9 , - 260.000 and taken its higher-quality loans as collateral , and the State of California and the City of San Francisco . which together had S7. - 755.000 on deposit . That leaves , at the moment . $5.500.000 in cash and Government bonds to satisfy some $30 million in claims against the bank . Says an FDIC official : " This has been the most difficult liquidation we 've ever experienced . " The major difficulty , these sources say . is that most of the cash attracted as deposits to the bank was lent to burrowers now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these borrowers have gone into bankruptcy . Others have simply moved , often to an unknown place . Still others are seeking court orders annulling their debts because they claim they were defrauded by Don C. Silverthorne. the hank 's cheerful founder and president . Such charges brought Mr. Silverthorne 's indictment by a Federal grand jury on the 79 counts of criminal violations of national banking laws , charges that he vigorously denies . Some of these borrowers contend that part of the money they received in loans from the bank was given back to Mr. Silverthorne as a form of kickback . They allege that other funds they borrowed were used , at Mr. Silverthorne 's suggestion , to purchase San Francisco National stock , often at inflated prices . This stock is now selling at 25 cents a share after once hitting $94 . Whatever the case , as much as 80% of the loans may be unsecured by collateral that Government liquidators could seize or sell when borrowers fail to pay . Depositors File a Suit With the prospect of losses so staggering . 41 unhappy institutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations but also Eastern credit unions and other investors , are trying to get first crack at the bank 's dwindling assets in order to cut their losses . It 's this legal fight that is raising all the questions about the role of Government regulators in the failure . In a Federal court case , these depositors charge that Federal hank regulatory agencies , knowing San Francisco National was " insolvent or in imminent danger of insolvency , " took unusual steps " to keep the bank open and to avoid disclosure of its true condition to the public . " Consequently , the depositors complain , they were lulled into keeping in the bank deposits of some $9 million , much of which they currently stand to lose . In ordinary bank failures , non-insured depositors and other unsecured creditors , including the FDIC , have equal claims to the remaining assets . The leftover cash is prorated among the claimants in proportion to the amounts owed them . But if San Francisco National 's institutional depositors win their case . the FDIC stands to lose all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This represents payments by the FDIC to insured depositors after the bank closed . Among other things , the institutional depositors maintain that neither the dismal loan picture nor the bank 's dependence on large cash advances from the Federal Relerve was reflected in the bank 's published financial statements . The Federal agencies , the depositors say , " permitted " the bank to publish these statements , which convinced the depositors that the bank was a safe place to put their money . In addition , the depositors say , the Comptroller of the Currency encouraged them to deposit funds in the bank in a vain effort to prevent its failure ; and Federal agencies , it 's further claimed , generally " silently acquiesced " to solicitation of time deposits for the bank by outside brokers . The institutional depositors are pinning their case partly on sworn depositions taken by lawyers in pre-trial discovery proceedings over the past weeks . " We 're finding out everything that went on in that bank , " says a lawyer closely connected with the proceedings . " and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disclosures reach far beyond those elicited by the Senate Permanent Investigations subcommittee that probed San Francisco National 's failure last spring . The subcommittee 's report , due out early next year . is expected to be critical of the U.S. Currency Comptroller 's office . Testimony in the Senate hearings , and additional disclosures that have already been filed in the current litigation , spell out much of the Government effort to save San Francisco National . The comptroller 's office so far has refused repeated requests for comment on the situation . FDIC 's Counter-Complaint The charges of the suing depositors actually come as a counter-complaint to an FDIC suit that further complicates the tangled litigation . The FDIC stilt claims it does n't owe the usual $10,000 in insurance to each of these depositors because the bank paid them . through money brokers , for making the deposits . The broker payments themselves are n't illegal , but combined with ordinary interest the FDIC contends they exceeded legally permissible rates that banks can pay on deposits : so the deposits , according to the FDIC , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , not only question the legality of the FDIC position . but also insist that the Government cooperated with bank management to lure their deposits into the bank . The agency with major regutatoly responsibility over the affairs of San Francisco National . before it failed . was the office of the S. Comptroller of the Currency . headed by James J Saxon Arnold E Larsen . regional comptroller of the currency in San Francisco. , dealt directly with San Francisco National during most of its brief history There 's no argument that Mr Saxon and his subordinates tried energetically to prevent San Francisco National from failing From May 1964. when Mr. Saxon first learned of the " true seriousness " of the bank 's affairs , until it closed eight months later on Jan 22. 1965. the comptroller 's office was involved continually in efforts to shore it tip " By saving it , " Mr Saxon explained in testimony last spring before Sen McClellan 's investigating committee . " a lot of people who otherwise would have been hurt would have been protected . " A Director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comptroller allegedly took suggest Just how desperate the situation was . For example , the minutes of a San Francisco National directors ' meeting held on Dec. 11 , 1961 -- only 39 days before the bank closed its doors  --  indicated that the comptroller had approved the use of bank funds to buy time deposits through money brokers to boost the bank 's badly depleted reserves . In part . the minutes read , " Chairman J Ehrlich repot ted to the board that verbal appr oval had been received from the Comptroller of the Currency which , if approved by the hoard , %%mild permit the hank to withdraw funds from the hank 's undivided profit account for the purpose of put chasing time deposits for the ' hank in oi der to strengthen the reserve position . " Mr Silverthorne was permitted to remain as president lot five months after hank examiners allegedly found that portions of the proceeds of some loans to bank borrowers were winding up in his personal bank account . " He ( Sil  --  erthorner did have a following , " Mr. Larsen explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stature , at the time , at least , were to be summarily removed , there is always the risk of a run on the bank which , of course , could hasten its demise . " Victor Del Tredici , a national bank examiner working under Messrs . Saxon and Larsen , wrote a report June 22 , 1964 , detailing apparent violations of national banking laws by Mr. Silverthorne . The report , addressed to the Justice Department , was sent first to Mr. Larsen , then to Mr. Saxon . Not until February 26 , 1965. was it submitted to the Justice Department . Directors of the bank itself were n't told , either , that Mr. Silverthorne was " receiving commissions in connection with loans " made by the hank , according to a deposition by regional comptroller Larsen . Asked why , Mr. Larsen replied : " Well , I think we were concerned that anything like this might have resulted in the immediate ouster of Mr. Silverthorne . We felt at the time he was probably in a better position to collect these sticky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of San Francisco claims it was kept equally uninformed . The portion of Mr. Del Tredici 's bank examination report containing the startling information about the management was omitted from the examination reports regularly given to the " Fed " by the comptroller ; officials told the Senate subcommittee it was omitted because it actually was a " work paper " not properly part of a bank exainination report . Unaware of the information in the " work paper , " the Federal Reserve Bank In August 1984 made the first of a long series of multimillion-dollar advances to the bank to help tide it over what Fed officials thought then was only a temporary cash squeeze . Despite daily doses of cash from the Fed , though , the bank 's affairs worsened steadily during the late summer and autumn of 1984 , The comptroller 's office began to search for another way to ease the bank 's predicament ? merger . " Ultimately , as time wore on , " Mr. Saxon testified , " and we had the examiner in there every day , day in and day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we sought to see if a merger of this bank could not be arranged with one of the more substantial institutions in that area . " None of the four banks approached was as sanguine about the prospect as the comptroller 's office , though . In one case , the directors of Central Valley National Bank , Oakland , signed a " letter of intent " to merge with San Francisco National ; but Central Valley officers , after spending only half a day poring over the bank 's lending records , quickly backed out of the deal . Right up to the bank 's final dramatic day of existence , Jan. 22. the comptroller 's office was still pressing hard to save It . Lytton Say . ings 8 : Loan Association had previously notified the bank it would n't renew a $1,500,000 time deposit in the bank maturing that day . S Regional Comptroller Larsen , aware that the withdrawal would " affect the liquidity of the bank substantially . " called Lytton 's chairman , Bart Lytton , and asked him to renew the deposit . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that earlier the same day , A. B. Merritt , vice president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank , was asked whether the Fed could extend further credit to the bank " He said as matters stood then , he did not think so . " Mr. Larsen asserted . Within several hours , however , the Fed did make an advance to the bank of SI 3 million , he said . He added that he could n't say why the Fed apparently reversed itself Asked whether the bank could have paid off Lytton 's SI 5 million deposit without funds from the Fed . Mr Larsen responded " No . " Lytton 's withdrawal dealt a se% ere blow to Mr Saxon s hopes of keeping the hank open Figures that bank examiners worked up that afternoon showed the hank- if it opened the next Monday- would fall snort by more than Si million the amount of cash it needed to pay maturing time deposits and other obligations So Mr. Saxon ordered it closed .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
