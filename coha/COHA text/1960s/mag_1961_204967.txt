A most pragmatic politician-statesman is Argentine President Arturo Frondizi , a man whose goals , once set , stay set . Characteristically , the goals Frondizi set for his journey to the U.S. and the U.N . last week were rigid-but realistic . He was determined to convince highly placed North Americans of his unwavering commitment to Western democracy , and he aimed to convince them that his kind of Argentina is worth helping . At the U.N . he resolved to cement his role as the independent-minded spokesman for Latin America now that Brazil 's Jnio Quadros has come a cropper . Frondizi could count the trip a success on both scores . <P> " Frank &; Blunt . " A " breakfast meeting " with President Kennedy stretched nearly into lunch , and the talk-called " frank and blunt " by an official-was plainly fascinating . Frondizi thanked Kennedy for past U.S. aid , outlined future needs . Unlike many such pleas , Argentina 's request was backed by accomplishment . Maneuvering his way past leftist and nationalist road blocks , Frondizi opened the government-monopoly oilfields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much oil that Argentina no longer spends $300 million annually on petroleum , even has the beginnings of an exportable surplus . Frondizi is unloading wasteful , government-run enterprises from lumber mills to shipyards , has ordered featherbedders slashed from the government 's railways . Foreign currency reserves are up sharply ; unemployment is virtually wiped out . At the end of three hours and 20 minutes of talk , Kennedy was visibly impressed with both Frondizi and his record . Said the U.S. President to his Argentine guest : " Now I know why you 've been able to survive so long . " <P> Nothing Hostile . In his performance at the U.N . General Assembly , Frondizi was no less adroit , carefully tuning his remarks to his audience . He quickly identified himself with the world 's underdeveloped nations ( " No backward country is fully independent " ) ; he showed proper concern about Castro 's Cuba by calling for " representative democracy in the entire American continent , " then softened the sting by again insisting on absolute nonintervention. * As for the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that we are members of the Western and Christian world , we are not doing so in order to create antagonistic blocs or pit one group of nations against another . " <P> <P> The speech sounded fine at home , where Argentines felt an unaccustomed pride in their austere , crisis-ridden and not very popular President . Nor did it hurt when Frondizi showed himself highly human by ducking out of his hotel one evening , taking a taxi over to Broadway and 46th Street . He dropped into a cafeteria , ordered a steak and a beer , then strolled on Broadway , licking an ice-cream cone and rubbernecking like any tourist . <P> * He also catered to Cuba by playing down a newly discovered batch of Cuban diplomatic documents detailing plans for undermining Argentina 's givernment.
