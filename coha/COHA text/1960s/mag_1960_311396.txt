He is the sort who sprouts baseball 's legends . Groundkeepers swear that they have tape-measured his mighty wallops at up to 600 ft . Of his speed afoot , it has been hazarded that if a race were to be run between him and an oak tree , the smart money would ride on the oak . Sportswriters fondly recall his beer-drinking exploits , like the time he hopped off a Cincinnati Reds bus during a brief stop to buy a case of cold brew , downed two bottles while getting his change . Former teammates remember being unable to get into his hotel room because he had stuffed towels under the door , turned on the shower 's hot water full blast , and while resting on his bed , converted the place into a steam bath in an effort to sweat off a few of his 250 lbs . But the amiable giant who furnishes the stuff for such stories is no modern Babe Ruth : he is Stephen Thomas Bilko , 31 , one of major-league baseball 's most fascinating flops . <P> Currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball , First Baseman Bilko has long been dubbed " the Paul Bunyan of the Bushes . " The name is well earned for Bilko 's minor-league record is formidable : in 1956 , for example , he batted .360 , hit 55 home runs , and knocked in 164 runs for Los Angeles , then in the Pacific Coast League . Such minor-league larruping at one time placed a $200,000 price tag around Stout Steve 's bullneck , had won him four major-league tries before this year 's with the Tigers . Each time he came up with personal hopes equaled only by those of his bosses ; each time , sooner or later , he went back down . The old sad pattern seems about to be repeated . <P> " Best Chance Ever . " The Tigers badly needed a first baseman for 1960-and as had happened before with other teams , Detroit 's eye landed on Bilko , who had had a fine 1959 season with Spokane . The Tigers got Bilko for the $25,000 draft price plus a salary of $15,000. and Manager Jimmy Dykes made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring training , Bilko batted .304. hit four home runs and felt good : " This is my best chance ever . If I do n't make it this time , I have no one to blame but myself . " <P> In the American League season 's first days , Bilko still looked good : he hit home runs on consecutive days against the Chicago White Sox . Then , as the weather grew warmer , came the seemingly slight difference in pitching between the majors and the top minors that is best described by Bilko himself : " Up here you see a good pitcher every day . Down there , maybe only five in seven days . And down there are a lot of young guys who do n't know what they 're doing yet . " <P> " Up-or Else . " To Steve Bilko , that difference has long been the one between success and failure . By last week he was hitting a poverty-stricken .135 , was riding the Detroit bench , and had every reason to expect to pack . To Steve Bilko , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can have your ups and downs . But here , you got to be up all the time-or else . "
