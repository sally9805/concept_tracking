A hush settled over the House of Commons . On the benches , every member wore a black tie ; the galleries were crowded with peers , ambassadors and solemn visitors . At 62 , Aneurin Bevan was dead , and the House of Commons paid him homage . " He was a bonny fighter , and a chivalrous one , " said Prime Minister Harold Macmillan , chief of the party Bevan had railed against all his life . Said Labor 's Hugh Gaitskell : " His death is as if a fire had gone out-a fire which we sometimes found too hot , by which we were sometimes scorched , but a fire which warmed and cheered us and stimulated us . " In a corner seat of the front bench below the gangway sat the solitary figure of Sir Winston Churchill , who had often been Nye Bevan 's bitterest foe . When Gaitskell recalled some of Nye 's fierce sallies , including the attack on Churchill when he cried that he welcomed the " opportunity of picking the bloated bladder of lies with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of remembrance and made a gracious bow toward the speaker . <P> Lost Prize . All Britain mourned the passing of the wild-haired Welshman who , in 30 years of public life , had never quite made it to the top . Except for Churchill , Nye Bevan was the greatest orator Britain has known in this century . His lilting , cadenced speech struck passion into friends and foes alike ; his fierce socialism demanded instant nationalization of industry , instant disarmament , instant betterment for workers and the poor . Yet in Nye , Socialism seemed locked in battle with a vaunting personal ambition . Time and again he reached the brink of power in his party and his country , only to lose the prize by rash behavior that made even his fellow Socialists feel safer in the hands of a competent but unexciting eminence like Clement Attlee . <P> Bevan was born to anger in the coal-seamed Ebbw Vale district of South Wales .

" <P> Even then he was a strange mixture of rabid rebel and good companion-the original Angry Young Man , full of both compassion and wit . The war with the Kaiser was none of his concern : his battle was with the thoughtless world of privilege that allowed his father to choke to death of a miner 's lung disease and never offered a tuppence in workmen 's compensation . In 1929 he burst upon Parliament " like some great disturbance of nature " as the new member from Ebbw Vale . <P> Youthful Ghost .
