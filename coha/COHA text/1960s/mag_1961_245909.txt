In the long and bitter battle between the railroads and the truckers , the railroads are making new gains by inducing their opponents to defect . Their weapon : piggybacking , the carrying of freight-loaded truck bodies on railroad flatcars . <P> Truck piggyback service for general freight has doubled in two years , become the rails ' most profitable single freight operation . Last week six of the biggest U.S. trucking firms joined in a new company to cooperate with the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad in building special piggyback terminals for general freight in Jersey City and Chicago . <P> All this has not gone unnoticed by Teamster Boss James Riddle Hoffa , a general who does not like to see his troops being ridden out of town on a rail . Piggybacking , claims Hoffa , has already cost the jobs of 20,000 teamsters . To fight the rails , he is pushing a new " tax " on truckers , requiring them to pay $5 into the union 's welfare or pension funds , beginning next year , for every truck they Diggy back . Hoffa has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> pressuring other truckers to sign up . He has also launched a full-scale public relations barrage against the railroads , loping to stir up support for an amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act that would limit the rails ' power to undercut freight charges on piggyback runs . <P> Polite Rebuttal . The rails have gone a <P> tep farther than piggybacking . They have <P> developed their own three-deck , 15-auto <P> flatcars that are helping them win back a big slice of the new-car hauling business lost to truckers . Once , the railroads moved 75% of all new autos . But the truckers devised efficient trailers that undercut railroad charges , by 1959 had left the rails only 8% of the business . Now the rails are grabbing a bigger share by charging only half as much as truckers on long hauls . One reason : on a cross-country haul , each flatcar replaces at least three high-wage truck drivers . By year 's end , Ford expects to ship 35% of its cars by rail , Chrysler 40% , American Motors 50% . Studebaker 70% . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets , ships less by rail than the others . <P> Ford Motor Co. , where the Teamsters stand to lose the most business , is being subjected to the biggest mail barrage emphasizing the number of drivers being thrown out of work . Ford answers with a form letter politely pointing out that the Teamsters originally threw railroad workers out of jobs when they took away the rails ' auto-hauling business , assures complainants that " trucks will continue to handle the majority of the volume of car shipments . " On hauls of up to 300 miles , trucks are still more economical ; but for anything longer , when drivers must be put up overnight , rails win hands down . Even Hoffa 's $5 tax will not cut seriously into the savings on long hauls . <P> Hot War ? The fight for auto freight may get rougher than words . The St. Louis-San Francisco Railroad , which developed the first three-level cars ( TIME , Oct. 24 ) , has already run into some mysterious acts of sabotage . Acid dumped from highway overpasses ruined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another of 150 . The railroad had to pay $484,000 for the damage . Other railroads have had cars damaged by shotgun blasts or peppered with rocks . To guard the shipments , Frisco 's auto trains now carry an extra caboose and an extra crew .
