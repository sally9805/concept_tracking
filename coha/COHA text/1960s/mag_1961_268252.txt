THE SECOND COMING <P> Turning and turning in the widening gyre <P> The falcon can not hear the falconer ; <P> Things fall apart ; the centre can not hold ; <P> Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world , <P> The blood-dimmed tide is loosed , and everywhere The ceremony of innocence is drowned ; <P> The best lack all conviction , while the worst <P> Are full of passionate intensity . <P> Surely some revelation is at hand ; <P> Surely the Second Coming is at hand . <P> The Second Coming ! Hardly are those words out <P> When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi <P> Troubles my sight : somewhere in sands of the desert <P> A shape with lion body and the head of a man , <P> A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun , <P> Is moving its slow thighs , while all about it <P> Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds . <P> The darkness drops again ; but now I know <P> That twenty centuries of stony sleep <P> Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come round at last , <P> Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born ? <P> From A PRAYER FOR MY DAUGHTER <P> And may her bridegroom bring her to a house <P> Where all 's accustomed , ceremonious ; <P> For arrogance and hatred are the wares <P> Peddled in the thoroughfares . <P> How but in custom and in ceremony <P> Are innocence and beauty born ? <P> Ceremony 's a name for the rich horn , <P> And custom for the spreading laurel tree . <P> THE LADY 'S FIRST SONG <P> I turn round <P> Like a dumb beast in a show , <P> Neither know what I am <P> Nor where I go , <P> My language beaten <P> Into one name ; <P> I am in love <P> And that is my shame . <P> What hurts the soul <P> My soul adores , <P> No better than a beast <P> Upon all fours . <P> A COAT <P> I made my song a coat <P> Covered with embroideries <P> Out of old mythologies From heel to throat ; <P> But the fools caught it , <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd wrought it . <P> Song , let them take it , <P> For there 's more enterprise In walking naked . <P> From AMONG SCHOOL CHILDREN <P> Labour is blossoming or dancing where <P> The body is not bruised to pleasure soul , <P> Nor beauty born out of its own despair , <P> Nor blear-eyed wisdom out of midnight oil . <P> O chestnut-tree , great-rooted blossomer , <P> Are you the leaf , the blossom or the bole ? <P> O body swayed to music , O brightening glance , <P> How can we know the dancer from the dance ? <P> From SAILING TO BYZANTIUM <P> That is no country for old men . The young <P> In one another 's arms , birds in the trees <P> - Those dying generations-at their song , <P> The salmon-falls , the mackerel-crowded seas , <P> Fish , flesh , or fowl , commend all summer long <P> Whatever is begotten , born , and dies . Caught in that sensual music all neglect <P> Monuments of unageing intellect . <P> An aged man is but a paltry thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Soul clap its hands and sing , and louder sing <P> For every tatter in its mortal dress , <P> Nor is there singing school but studying <P> Monuments of its own magnificence ; <P> And therefore I have sailed the seas and come <P> To the holy city of Byzantium . <P> THE SPUR <P> You think it horrible that lust and rage
