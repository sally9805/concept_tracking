The word on John Updike is not yet in . Thus far he remains a victim of the kiss-and-kick system of American reviewing . Similar in consequence to the error of bringing boxer along too quickly by overmatching him early in his career , this system involves the rapid and exaggerated piling up of encomiums that make for a literary reputation which , just as rapidly and exaggeratedly , is deflated . In Updike 's case , before he had time to stop rubbing his cheek where Miss Mary McCarthy had presented him with a fine motherly kiss for his first novel , he received a knee in the groin delivered by Alfred Chester , quickly followed by a solid clop to the abdomen by Norman Podhoretz , and , as finisher , nice clean judo chop over the back of the neck by Richard Gilman which would have brought any normal man to his knees . Not Updike . He , apparently , is not awaiting the word . Loved by The Times , slashed by The Trib , adored by Harper 's abhorred by The Nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocking out book after book . If Updike seems less than captive to American criticism , neither is he much enamored of the contemporary national fiction . In a recent essay on the Argentine writer , Jorge Luis Borges , he claims to be looking for a " way out of the dead-end narcissism and downright trashiness of present American fiction . " I am not so certain about that dead end or that trashiness , but it seems to me that Updike has already found a way out , and the door through which he has chosen to exit is marked Language . Alone among American novelists of seriousness and of serious production , he is primarily interested in language and its effects . " Language , " remarks a young minister in the course of a ser mon in his most recent novel , - aerates the barren density of brute matter with the penetrations of the mind , of the spirit . " Updike , clearly , has taken the sermon to heart . Clearly , too , he has the gift of language . It is , gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whose vice is glibness . There is , however , often a very fine line between the two . As the man says , all that glitters is not gold . Although he continues to improve as a prospector , Updike is , I fear , not yet the metallurgist he shall have to become if he is to realize his considerable ambitions as a novelist . Of the Farm is in size a slight novel , a novella really , running to only 174 largely printed , generously margined pages . It is also exceedingly short of compass ? four is the number of its characters , So acres of farm land in Southeastern Pennsylvania is the total area in which it takes place . That it has n't much in the way of scope , however , ought not to be accounted a criticism , for Updike has never been quite so interested in spreading out as in boring in . His novel is , in a sense , a love story ; its subject is that oldest of old love triangles ? that between a man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother ! If it accomplishes nothing else , Updike 's creation of the mother in Of the Farm provides a tremendous service for Jewish mothers everywhere . In effect , it lets them off the hook by limning a non-Jewish mother who is a mother 's mother , the mother of all mothers . Next to Up-dike 's creation , the mother in Bruce Jay Friedman 's novel , A Mother 's Kisses , for example , seems like a favorite aunt . For considered ruthlessness , for a propensity to interfere in her son 's married life , for an utter inability to simply let go ? it is Of the Fm-m 's Mrs. Robinson , Sr. two to one . The novel is told in the first-person singular voice of Mrs. Robinson 's 35-year-old son Joey , who , with his recently acquired second wife and elevenyear-old stepson , has come down from New York for a weekend visit with his mother at her farm . Joey Robinson is very Updikean in construction . Which means he is a man of artistic , e quisite , alas sometimes quivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he has that kind of peripheral vision which allows him to pick similes out of the corner of his eye . His mother had always thought Joey had the makings of a poet , had desperately wanted him to be one , but instead he works , as he puts it , " for firm which arranges educational programs for corporations on such matters as ta minimization , overseas expansion , federal contract acquisition , and automation . My specialty is advertising dollar distribution , which is to say , broadly , corporate image distribution . " Joey deals in images ? that is to say , things which are not really there , Moreover , in his extreme susceptibility to women , he is not merely not his own man , but , when you get right down to it , not quite a man at all . Hence , to both his mother and his wife Peggy , he is neither Joseph nor Joe , but Joey ? the perennial boy , God love him . From the novel 's first pages Mrs. Robinson hovers over everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her son is one of those impossibly tangled love-hate affairs . Pulling up to the farm in his car , Joey sights his " mother 's shape ... which had emerged from the house and was moving through the blue shadow of the hemlock that guarded the walk . " And not much later : " Her spirit had acquired a troubling resonance , a murky subtlety doubly oppressive out of doors ? as if in being surrounded by her farm we had been plunged into the very territory of her thoughts . " We are in Mother Country . From here through dinner , mild enough conversation , and the bedtime departure of his wife and stepson , it is ? via Updike 's commanding technical facility ? only a short time before Joey joins his mother in the living room , their first moments alone together , and she announces : " ' I 'm surprised at you ' " ' At what ? ' " " ' That you would need stupid woman his wife to give you confidence ' . " Not only does Mrs Robinson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , but she makes a point of stirring up his guilt over his leaving his three children to marry his second wife . Meanwhile , in her spare time she does her best to alienate Joey 's stepson from his mother . And in a nice touch of cool contempt the dear woman refers to the bikini in which her daughter-in-law bathes as an " Iowa Jima . " For his part , the best that poor Joey can muster in rebellion : " I 'm 3c and I 've been through hell and I do n't see why that old lady has to have such d hold over me . It 's ridiculous . It 's degrading . " Yet Joey seems to have a taste for degradation ; either that or an exceptionally high tolerance for it . For as the emotional struggle between his mother and his wife progresses from a guerrilla war of innuendo to an unlimited battle of open invective , he keeps his uncomfortable ground of neutrality . " You do n't stand up to anything , " the wife remarks at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slug it out and try to make peace . " Joey may be spineless , all right , but spinelessness has perhaps never before been propped up with such eloquence as Updike brings to it . At one point in the novel , he leaves the battleground to go off to cut the weeds in his mother 's fields , and Updike 's description of the process is of a brilliance that one is not likely to find in any other American novelist . Here is the last paragraph from the episode : " Black-eyed susans , daisy fleabane , toadflax , goldenrod , butter-and-eggs each flower of which was like tiny dancer leaping , legs together , scudded past the tractor wheels . Stretched scatterings of flowers moved in a piece , like the heavens , constellated by my wheels ' revolution , on my right ; and lay as drying fodder on my left . Midges existed in stationary clouds that , though agitated by my interruption , did not follow me , but resumed their selfencircling conversation . Crickets sprang crackling away from the wheels ; butterflies loped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the hands of a mute concubine would examine , flutteringly , the corpse of her giant lover . The sun grew higher . The metal hood acquired a nimbus of heat waves that visually warped each stalk . The tractor body was flecked with foam and I , rocked back and forth on the iron seat shaped like a woman 's hips , alone in nature , as hidden under the glaring sky as at midnight , excited by destruction , weightless , discovered in myself a swelling which I idly permitted to stand , thinking of Peggy . My wife is a field . " The other side of the coin is the by-now famous Updike excesses . There are moments when . reader , dodging his way through the lush lawns of simile and metaphor , feels something like Joey atop his tractor cutting through a field , not of woods , but of marzipan . So much the lover of language , so fascinated by his gift for it , Updike is prone to fall captive to it - and often at the expense of his narrative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is not opposed to postponing orgasm to devote a few sentences to capturing the play of light from the moon upon the floor . Only a poet could command such patience ! But back to Joey and his adventures at Disaster Farm . His weekend , as it turns out , is more revelatory than he would have expected . Throughout he finds himself comparing his wife and his mother and the balance does not come out in his wife 's favor : " .. . while I was fitting the tractor back into its narrow stable Peggy continued across the lawn into the house , walked slowly across the stretch of grass where I had seen my mother outrace my father . " The lowest point of this sad song - which might go by the title " I Failed to Marry a Girl Just Like the Girl that Married Dear Old Dad " - conies when Joey , in conversation with his mother , admits of his wife : " ' She is stupid . ' I am always a little behind my mother , always arriving at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing me sitting upright , excited like boy by my discovery of the obvious . ' Remarkably stupid . ' " Finally , to cap off the perfectly wretched weekend , Mrs. Robinson , Sr. undergoes an attack of an old lung ailment . Frightened by this sharp reminder of her mortality , Joey , characteristically , goes after his wife for help . " As I ran across the lawn , " he notes , " my stomach grovelled with that conviction , remembered from childhood , of unworthiness , of guilt , of the world being colorful final parade that I had somehow missed and that , as I raced through the darkening streets of Olinger , I could dimly overhear but could not find . " Nor , one might add , is Joey ever likely to find it . Although his mother does not die , it is apparent that her death ca n't be far off . As the novel ends , Joey is preparing for the return to New York . His marriage will probably last , if that is the word . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will continue to be , in death as in life , her very own poet manque.
