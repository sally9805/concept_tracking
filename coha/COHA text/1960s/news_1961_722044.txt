txt Will consumer spending speed up this fall and thus add zip to economic re-covery ? Orders for paper board shipping containers indicate manufacturers of consumer products are expecting their sales this fall to top not only the recession-hit period a year ago but also the prosperous final months of 1959 . Manufacturers usually place their orders for boxes 30 to 60 days before they expect to receive and use the containers , gearing orders to their sales forecasts . These forecasts are based on the pace of incoming orders from retailers and wholesalers . Even an industry-wide container price increase of about 10% has failed to slow the box business , producers say . " Our container business is better right now than at any time since early 1959 , " says Leo Schoenhofen , president of Container Corp . of America , a major producer . " Our August shipments were 12% ahead of last year , and orders indicate the September gain will be as good or perhaps even better . " Order Backlog Grows St. Regis Paper Co , another big maker of containers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year ago , " and that in contrast with the leaner months earlier this year , the firm is building " a hefty order backlog . " Figures gathered by the Fibre Box Association , headquartered in Chicago , show that the industry 's output , measured in terms of the amount of paper board used , already is running at a record pace . Yesterday , the association reported that box output in the seven days ended September 9 hit 1,985,000,000 square feet , the highest for any Labor Day week and 9% more than the like week a year earlier . Average weekly shipments last month ran 12.8% ahead of August , 1980 , helping push average weekly shipments for the year to date 3.3% ahead of last year and 2.6% ahead of the- record 1959 pace . When most firms put through the 10% price increarie on September 1 or a few weeks before , it was the first boost they had attempted since September , 1959 .

An official of the Chicago-based shipping container division of Weyerhaeuser Timber Co. , Tacoma , Wash. , comments : " The fact that orders keep right on rolling in at these higher prices sure makes it look like this price increase is going to stick . " No Cracks Purehasing agents responsible for buying boxes admit they have n't found any cracks in the new price structure . " Usually when the box plants raised prices , you could always count on several calling to tell you they 're willing to sell at the old price , " says an official of Borg-Warner Corp . ' s Borg &; Beck division , which makes auto parts . " This time , we have n't been approached by discounters .

The cartons come in such a wide range of sizes and shapes that they 're Used to ship such varied products as ' shirts , shotguns , perfume and antifreeze . They cost as little as two cents or as much as $5 . Most of them go no farther than from the factory to the retailer 's back door , although some containing small appliances , for instance , do travel to the consumer . The consumers , who ultimately get most of what travels in shipping containers , are being watched warily by economists who say they are lending only limited support to the economic recovery which began last spring . Consumer spending has not been expanding as rapidly As disposable personal income , the economists note . They add that many consumers in recent months appear to have been concentrating instead on building up savings and paying off instalment debts .

" We 've got two or three customers whose ordering pretty much tells what business is going to be like for us during the fall and Christmas season , " says the chief executive of a small Midwest container firm . " One makes lighting fixtures for homes , another makes toys and one makes metal cabinets for kitchen remodeling jobs and the like .
