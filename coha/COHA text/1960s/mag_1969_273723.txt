AS opponents of conglomerates tell it , the usual takeover scenario is a melodramatic affair involving a helpless target company and an unscrupulous interloper . The script has been scrambled in the case of Akron 's B. F. Goodrich and its ardent but so far unsuccessful suitor , Northwest Industries . The rubber company 's public relations and legal fight against Northwest 's four-month-old takeover bid has been waged so well that , even though it is not yet over , it is looked upon as a classic corporate counteroffensive against an unwanted but aggressive merger partner . <P> Northwest President Ben Heineman appears to be a businessman at bay . Only hours before his conglomerate 's annual meeting began in Chicago last week , the Justice Department announced that it would seek to block Northwest 's bid for Goodrich . A stockholder at the meeting asked , why not just drop the whole thing ? Nothing doing , replied Heineman . " I do n't think I have ever been known as a summer soldier . " <P> Venerable and Vulnerable . Heineman , 55 , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Western Railway in 1956 and surprised skeptical industry veterans by turning the company into a moneymaker . Only four years ago , he began spreading into steel , clothing and chemicals , and later formed Northwest Industries , a holding company . Its sales rose impressively from $260 million in 1965 to $701 million in 1968 . <P> Meanwhile , 99-year-old Goodrich , the nation 's fourth largest rubber company , was taking a rather bumpy ride . Last year it earned only 3.9% on its $1.1 billion sales , lowest profit margin among the Big Four . Goodrich was obviously vulnerable to takeover because its ownership was widely scattered and the price-earnings ratio of its shares was relatively modest . It was not long before Goodrich began to draw the attention of a number of acquisitive companies , including Northwest . Goodrich Chairman Ward Keener , a onetime economics professor , began mapping defensive strategies as early as last June . <P> In March , Northwest revised its January proposal and offered a complex package of debentures , preferred stock and warrants , then worth about $75 , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who dismissed what he called a " funny money " offer , had assembled a potent band of allies . For legal advice , he had White &; Case , the Manhattan firm that masterminded American Broadcasting 's successful defense against Howard Hughes last year . As investment bankers , he had First Boston Corp . To burnish Goodrich 's image , Keener used three public relations firms , among them Hill &; Knowlton , the world 's biggest . <P> The defenders have waged a well-coordinated campaign . Items : <P> &gt; To sway Goodrich shareholders , costly advertisements passed the word that not only was Northwest attempting to swallow a much larger company , but it had also reported a first-quarter loss of $3.9 million . Recent ads pointed out that Northwest 's stock had dropped from $140 in January , to 81 last week , with the result that Heineman 's generous original package offer for one share of Goodrich was now worth about $10 less . ( Goodrich stock closed last week at 44 ? )            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
