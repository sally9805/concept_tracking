The four-man OAS inspection team last week reported on its brief June visit through the jails and files of slain Dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo . The 62-page report reflected the conflicting views of its authors . The three Latin American members favored a relatively clean bill of health to pave the way for readmission of the Dominican Republic into polite inter-American society . The U.S. pressed for a stronger report , condemning the Trujillos for their many past crimes , skeptical of their promises to reform . <P> The result was a compromise of sorts . The four ambassadors noted , without comment , that the government had declared " its intention to bring about a democratic transformation , " had pledged never again to meddle in the internal affairs of another state-a reference to Trujillo 's plot to murder Venezuela 's President Romulo Betancourt . The OAS team also noted charges that police repressions continued even after the old dictator was dead . Conclusion : " It would be premature to determine the depth of change in the character and policy of the Dominican Republic . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balaguer immediately invited the OAS investigators to return and see for themselves . He also sent personal invitations to a number of leading Latin American jurists to attend the trial of the accused assassins of Dictator Trujillo . <P> Balaguer. who had faithfully served the old dictator as President , is nonetheless widely regarded as a sincere and decent man . He appears to have more to be proud of than to hide . There were still scattered reports of strong-arm repressions : 20 arrests in the city of Santiago . the " accidental " death of a youth jailed for ripping Trujillo 's picture off a nightclub wall . The government outlawed the far-left Movimiento Popular Dominicano . <P> Growing Opposition . Yet Balaguer made no attempt to curb three booming , middle-of-the-road opposition parties . One led by three returned exiles , reported signing up 800 new members a day , were met by crowds so exuberant that they even embraced the police escorts . Another group , known as the National Civic Union , signed up 2,500 members in a three-day canvass of the non-Trujillo upper classes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ad in El Caribe criticizing the government . Balaguer answered with a 2,000-word letter agreeing that changes were needed , but asking for patience . " You want the country to be converted into a new Switzerland , ' ' he complained , " and demand that I effect that miracle overnight . " <P> Despite the encouraging signs , the opposition fears that no real change is possible until the Trujillos are gone for good . Says one opposition leader , Nicolas Silfa : " They must go not only because they are in so many key positions , but also because they own so much of the island . And , most important , the people hate them . " <P> Many opposition members believe that the Trujillos intend to stay on at all costs . But there is the alternate possibility that they will go quietly , leaving Balaguer as the legitimate head of the government , at least until the elections , promised next May . Such a course would avert the danger of a chaotic period , in which the forces of Castro and Communism work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
