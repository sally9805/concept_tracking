Boston , just before the American Revolution . To the left of the stage , ROBIN , a young man barely eighteen , in a coarse grey coat , well-worn but carefully repaired , leather breeches , blue yarn stockings , and a worn three-cornered hat . He carries a heavy oak-sapling cudgel and has a wallet slung over his shoulder . Beside him , his brother , a BOY of ten or twelve , dressed in the same respectable but somewhat rustic manner . On the far left of the stage , the triangular prow of a dory ; beside it , a huge FERRYMAN holding an upright oar . He has a white curling beard . His dress , although eighteenth century , half suggests that he is Charon . Lined across the stage and in the style of a primitive New England sampler , are dimly seen five miniature houses : a barber shop , a tavern , a white church , a shabby brick house with a glass bay window , and a pillared mansion , an official 's house , on its cornice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are miniature , but their doors are man-size . Only ROBIN , his BROTHER , and the FERRYMAN are lit up . ROBIN Here 's my last crown , your double price for ferrying us across the marsh at this ungodly hour . FERRYMAN A crown ! Do you want me to lose my soul ? Do you see King George 's face ? judging us on this silver coin ? I have no price . ROBIN You asked for double . p. 3 FERRYMAN I 'll take the crown for your return trip . Takes the coinNo one returns . ROBIN No one ? FERRYMAN No one . Legs go round in circles here . This is the city of the dead . ROBIN What 's that ? FERRYMAN I said this city 's Boston , No one begs here . Are you deaf ? The little houses on stage light up , then dim out ROBIN To the FERRYMANShow me my kinsman 's mansion . You must know him  --  Major Molineux , the most important man in town . FERRYMAN The name 's familiar Molineux Was n't he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home now . If you 'll wait here , you 'll meet him on his rounds . All our important people drift sooner or later to my ferry landing , and stand here begging for the moon . You 'll see your cousin . You 're well-placed . ROBIN I know it . My kinsman 's a big man here . He told me he would make my fortune ; I 'll be a partner in his firm , either here or in London . FERRYMAN Settle for London , that 's your city , Boy . Majors are still sterling silver across the waters . All the English-born suddenly seem in love with London . Your cousin 's house here is up for sale . p. 4 ROBIN He cares for England . Rule Britannia , that 's the tune he taught me . I 'm surprised he 's leaving . FERRYMAN He 's surprised ! He seemed to belong here once . He wished to teach us Rule Britannia , but we could n't get it through our heads . He gave us this to keep us singing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joking , it 's a lobster . FERRYMAN No . Look , it 's horny , boiled and red , It is the Major 's spitting image . On the other side of the stage , TWO BRITISH REDCOATS are seen marching slowly in step with shouldered muskets . Rule Britannia played faintly FERRYMAN Pointing to SOLDIERSHere are the Major 's chicken lobsters . ROBIN Our soldiers ! FERRYMAN We call them lobsterbacks . They are the Major 's privates . Wherever they are gathered together , he is present . You 'll feel his grip behind their claws . What are you going to do now : run home to Deerfield , take a ship for England , Boy , or chase the soldiers ? ROBIN Why , I 'm staying here . I like soldiers . They make me feel at home . They kept the Frenchmen out of Deerfield . They 'll tell me where my kinsman lives . p. 5 FERRYMAN The French are finished . The British are the only Frenchmen left . Did n't you say your cousin 's name was Molineux ? ROBIN He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Money . The soldiers make me pay them for the pleasure of shuttling them across the marsh . Run , Boy , and catch those soldiers ' scarlet coat-tails , while they 're still around . The FERRYMAN goes off pushing his boat ROBIN and the BOY advance towards the SOLDIERS ROBIN I need your help , Sirs . FIRST SOLDIER SmilingWe are here for service , that 's our unpleasant duty . ROBIN I liked the way the soldiers smiled . I wonder how anyone could distrust a soldier . BOY We 've lost our guide . ROBIN We 'll find another . BOY Why did that boatman gnash his teeth at Cousin Major ? ROBIN He was cold . That 's how big city people talk . Let 's walk . We 're here to see the city . As ROBIN and the BOY start moving , the miniature houses light up one by one and then go dark . A BARBER comes out of the barber shop ; he holds a razor , and a bowl of suds . A TAVERN KEEPER enters holding a newspaper p. 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shave a wig . TAVERN KEEPER You mean a Tory . BARBER Shave them to the bone !

We have an everlasting city , but here in this unsteady brightness , nothing 's clear , unless the Lord enlighten us and show the winner ! A PROSTITUTE comes out of the bay-window house . She wears a red skirt and a low , full-bosomed white blouse PROSTITUTE Here in the shadow of the church , I save whatever God despises  --  Whig or Tory , saint or sinner , I 'm their refuge from the church . The pillared mansion lights up . A MAN comes out in a blue coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grayish mask covered with pocks . His forehead juts out and divides in a double bulge . His nose is a yellow eagle 's beak . His eyes flash like fire in a cave . He looks at himself in a mirror p. 7 MAN WITH MASK My mind 's on fire . This fire will burn the pocks and paleness from my face . Freedom has given me this palace . I 'll go and mingle with the mob . Now the houses are dark . ROBIN rubs his eyes in a daze , stares into the darkness , then turns to his brother BOY Who are these people , Brother Robin ? We 're in the dark and far from Deerfield . ROBIN We 're in the city , little brother . Things will go smoother when we find our kinsman , Major Molineux . BOY Our kinsman is n't like these people . He is a loyal gentleman . ROBIN We 'll see .

You 're made right . ROBIN Oh , I will be made when I find my kinsman . You must know him , he 's a man of some importance in your city , Lady . WOMAN The Major dwells here . ROBIN You 're thinking of some other major , Lady ; mine is something more important than a major , he 's a sort of royal governor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from here to China . He has a gilded carriage , twenty serving men , two flags of England flying from his lawn . You could hide your little house behind a sofa in his drawing-room . WOMAN I know , your kinsman is a man of parts , that 's why he likes to camp here . Sometimes his greatness wearies him . These days even kings draw in their horns , and mingle with the common people . Listen , you 'll hear him snoring by the roof . ROBIN I hear a hollow sound . My kinsman must be happy here . I envy him this hideaway . WOMAN You mean to say you envy him the mistress of his house . Do n't worry , a kinsman of the Major 's is my kinsman . I knew you right away . You have your kinsman 's leg and shoulders . He wears an old three-cornered hat and leather small-clothes here in the rain . Why , you are the good old gentleman , only you 're young !

WOMAN takes ROBIN 'S hat and twirls it on her fingerWhat are you doing with my hat ? WOMAN I 'm showing you our Boston rites of hospitality . The Major would kill me , if I turned you out on such a night . I even have a downstairs bedroom for your brother . I find a playroom comes in handy . BOY I want to go with Robin . WOMAN Oh , dear , children keep getting me in trouble . We have a law . A bell is heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house Her light goes out BOY Why did the lady slam her door ? ROBIN The bell reminded her of something . She has to catch up on her sleep . p. 16 BOY Has the Major left his mansion ? Is he really sleeping here ? ROBIN How can I tell you ? Everyone answers us in riddles . BOY She said , the Major dwells here . ROBIN That 's her city way of being friendly , Brother . BOY Robin , the Major could afford to buy the lady better clothes . She was almost naked . ROBIN She was dressed unwisely . BOY Is n't Eve almost naked in our Bible ? ROBIN Do n't ask so many questions , brother . I wish I knew the naked truth . A WATCHMAN enters , dishevelled and yawning . He holds a lantern with a bell tied to it and a spiked staff WATCHMAN Stop , we do n't allow this sort of talk about the Bible here . ROBIN You are mistaken , Sir . I said I wished I knew the naked truth . WATCHMAN You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing naked children . You 're leading this child into perdition . We have a fine for that .

WATCHMAN And you thought you 'd find him in this house Doing his martial drill . ROBIN You know him ! My kinsman 's Major Molineux . I see you know him , he will pay you if you will lead us to his house . WATCHMAN SingingYour aunt 's the lord high sheriff , your uncle is King George ; if you ca n't pay the tariff , the house will let you charge . ROBIN I asked for Major Molineux . WATCHMAN Keep asking ! We are cleaning house . The Major 's lost a lot of money lately , buying bad real estate . He ca n't afford his country cousins . Move , you filthy , sucking hayseed ! or I 'll spike you with my stick ! BOY Why do n't you hit him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by daybreak , Boy . ROBIN We 'll go , Sir . I 'm your countryman learning the customs of the city . WATCHMAN Goes off singingBaggy buttocks , baggy buttocks , The Queen of England 's willingTo serve you for a shillingAnd stick you in the stocks . p. 18 ROBIN We 're learning how to live . The man was drunk . BOY Our Deerfield watchmen only drink at Communion . Something 's wrong , these people need new blood . ROBIN Perhaps they 'll get it . Here 's a clergyman , he 'll tell us where to find our kinsman . The CLERGYMAN comes across the stage . He is awkwardly holding a large English flag on a staff ROBIN Help me , I beg you , Reverend Sir , I 'm from Deerfield , I 'm looking for my kinsman , Major Molineux . No one will tell me where he lives . CLERGYMAN I have just left the Major 's house . He is my patron and example . A good man  --  it 's a pity though he 's so outspoken ; other good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me this British flag to put above my pulpit  --  a bit outspoken ! ROBIN Our country 's flag , Sir ! CLERGYMAN Yes , a bit outspoken . Come I 'll lead you to your kinsman 's house . The MAN WITH THE MASK strides hurriedly across the stage , and unrolls a rattlesnake flag , which he hands to the CLERGYMAN , who has difficulty in managing the two flags MAN WITH MASK I have a present for you , Parson : our Rattlesnake . " Do n't tread on me ! " it says . I knew you 'd want to have one . Hang it up somewhere in church ; there 's nothing like the Rattlesnake for raising our declining faith . p. 19 CLERGYMAN I thank you , Sir . MAN WITH MASK You 'd better hurry . Think of the man who had no garment for the wedding . Things are moving . MAN WITH MASK hurries off stage CLERGYMAN To himselfGod help us , if we lose ! Turns to go ROBIN Sir , you 're leaving ! You promised me you 'd lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me help you with the flags . CLERGYMAN I 'll see you later . I have to hurry . I have a sick parishioner , a whole sick parish ! I have a notion one of these flags will cure us . Which ? Everyone 's so emphatic here . If you should meet your kinsman , tell him I 'm praying for him in my church . CLERGYMAN goes out A loud " hem , hem " is heard . The MAN IN THE PERIWIG comes jauntily forward followed by the TWO BARBERS . He goes to the house with the bay-window and raps with his cane . The light inside the house goes on . A rattlesnake flag has been nailed to the door . No one sees ROBIN and the BOY BARBER Look , Your Honor , Mrs. Clark has taken on the Rattlesnake . MAN IN PERIWIG Good , this pricks my fainting courage . " Do n't tread on me ! " That 's rather odd for Mrs. Clark . p. 20 BARBER Come on , your Honor . SECOND BARBER There 's always a first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank God , I 've but one life to give my country . Lay on , Macduff ! I owe this to my reputation , boys .

SECOND BARBER Two ten pound tea chests . The lady needs a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking on the foamy breakers ! Help ! help ! I wish my lady had a firm , hard-chested figure like a mast , but what has love to do with fact ? A lover loves his nemesis ; the patriotic act . The MAN IN THE PERIWIG gives the lady the crown and passes in . The lights go out BARBER Once to every man and nation comes the time a gentleman wants to clear his reputation . TAVERN KEEPER Once to every man and nation comes the time a man 's a man . BARBER His Honor 's perished on the blast . The BARBER saunters off along with TAVERN KEEPER . The BOY turns to ROBIN , who is lost in thought ROBIN I think the Major has left . By watching I have learned to read the signs . The Rattlesnake means Major Molineux is out . A British flag means he 's at home . BOY You talk in riddles like the town . ROBIN Say what you mean ; mean what you say : that 's how we used to talk in Deerfield . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillared mansion lights up . ROBIN and the BOY approach it . The Lion and Unicorn of England are gone . Instead , a large Rattlesnake flag is showingBrother , we 've reached our destination . This is our kinsman 's house . I know it from the steel engraving that he gave us when he came to Deerfield . Our journey 's over . Here 's our mansion . p. 22 BOY Robin , it has a Rattlesnake . ROBIN That means the Major 's not at home . The MAN WITH THE MASK comes out of the mansion . Half his face is now fiery red , the other half is still mottled MAN WITH MASK I am the man on horseback . ROBIN No , you 're walking , Sir . MAN WITH MASK I am a king . ROBIN The king 's in England . You must be sick . Have you seen your face ? Half 's red , the other half is pocked and mottled . MAN WITH MASK Oh I 'm as healthy as the times . I am an image of this city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MASK draws out a small British flag ROBIN Our British flag , Sir . MAN WITH MASK Yes , it does n't help my illness any more , when I try to cool my burning brow , or blow my nose on it . ROBIN I know a man who used to own this house . Let 's see if he 's still here . Perhaps , my friend can help to heal your sickness . MAN WITH MASK My face will be entirely red soon ; then I 'll be well . Who is your friend ? p. 23 ROBIN A kinsman , Major Molineux . MAN WITH MASK I have a fellow feeling for him . The Major used to own this house : now it 's mine . I 'm taking over , I 've just signed the final deed . Do you see my nameplate on the gate ? ROBIN The Rattlesnake ? MAN WITH MASK The Rattlesnake . ROBIN If I pick up the Rattlesnake , will it help me find my kinsman ? I think he needs my help . We are his last relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the first , my Boy . ROBIN What do you mean ? You talk like Christ . MAN WITH MASK The first shall be the last , my Boy . The Major has a heavy hand ; we have been beaten to the ground . ROBIN My kinsman has an open hand . MAN WITH MASK Ridden like horses , fleeced like sheep , worked like cattle , clothed and fed like hounds and hogs ! ROBIN I want to find him . MAN WITH MASK Whipping-posts , gibbets , bastinadoes and the rack ! I must be moving . ROBIN Wait , I 'll take up the Rattlesnake . Please , help me find my kinsman . ROBIN takes hold of the MAN WITH THE MASK 'S shoulder . The MAN steps back and draws his sword p. 24 MAN WITH MASK Move ! You 've torn my cloak . You 'd better keep a civil tongue between your teeth . I have a mission . ROBIN raises his cudgel . He and the MAN WITH THE MASK stand a moment facing each other BOY Brain him , Robin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like our kinsman , Robin . ROBIN I only asked for information . MAN WITH MASK For information ! Information is my trade . I was a lawyer before I learned the pleasures of the military life . The Major was my first teacher . Now I know you ! I met you at the tavern . You were short of cash then . Take this crown : drink to the Major , then a health to Greenough , and the Rattlesnake . To Greenough ! ROBIN You 're a fighter . MAN WITH MASK I hate war , wars leave us where they find us , do n't they , boy Let 's talk about my health . ROBIN Where can I find my kinsman ? MAN WITH MASK He owned this house . Men used to find him here all day , before the storms disturbed his judgment , He 's out now ranging through the town , looking for new accommodations . Wait here . You 'll meet him on his walk . Strides off singingThe king is in his counting house ; we 're counting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face half red now ? He 's changing color . ROBIN I do n't know . He is someone out of " Revelations "  --  Hell revolting on its jailers . The church lights up a little . ROBIN walks over to it , and looks in a windowOur church is empty , brother . Moonbeams are trembling on the snow-pure pews , the altar 's drowned in radiant fog , a single restless ray has crept across the open Bible . Turns to a gravestone by the churchI 'm lonely . What 's this ? A gravestone ? A grave ? Whose grave ? I think the Major must have died : everything tells me he is gone and nothing is forever . Turns back to the churchBrother , the moon 's the only worshipper ! The CLERGYMAN comes out of the church . He lays a white clay pipe on the steps and holds up a little colored celluloid whirligig CLERGYMAN The wind has died . ROBIN What are you doing ? CLERGYMAN I 'm playing with this whirligig , and waiting to see which way the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to guess the whims of the wind . I am waiting for a sign . A strange thing for a modern churchman . ROBIN My father says the Church is a rock . p. 26 CLERGYMAN Yes , yes , a rock is blind . That 's why I 've shut my eyes . ROBIN I see my father . He 's the Deerfield minister , and Church of England . You remind me of my father . CLERGYMAN Be careful , son . Call no man father : that 's what we tell the Roman clergy ; sometimes I think we go too far , they get their people out for Mass . ROBIN Father . When I shut my eyes , I dream I 'm back in Deerfield . The people sit in rows below the old oak ; a horseman stops to water his horse and to refresh his soul . I hear my father holding forth thanksgiving , hope and all the mercies  --  CLERGYMAN Those village pastors !

It takes a wolfhound now to catch a flock ! ROBIN Why are you waiting for the wind ? CLERGYMAN Taking up two little flagsDo you see these two flags ? One 's the Union Jack , the other is the Rattlesnake . The wind will tell me which to fly . ROBIN I 'm thinking of the absent one . My kinsman , Major Molineux is absent . The storms have hurt his house lately . No one will help me find him . p. 27 CLERGYMAN Perhaps the wind will blow him back . ROBIN I met a strange man , Colonel Greenough ; Half of his face was red , and half was pocked . He said , " Wait here , and you will meet your kinsman on his walk . " CLERGYMAN You 'd better wait here then . That red and pocked man tends to speak the truth . ROBIN Why was his face two-colors , Father ? CLERGYMAN He is an image of the city . If his whole face turns red as blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say more about my kinsman , Father . You said he was your friend and patron . CLERGYMAN Poor Molineux ! he served the clergy somewhat better than this city . He had a special pew , you know . He used to set a grand example . ROBIN He used to ! You speak as if he were dead ! CLERGYMAN Men blamed me , but I liked to watch his red coat blazing like the sunset at Sunday morning service here . He was an easy-going fellow , a lover of life , no Puritan . He had invention , used to send two six foot Privates here to help with the collection . Yes , I had to like him . He had his flaws , of course . ROBIN A red coat blazing like the sunrise , that 's how the Major was in Deerfield ; the gold lion of England shone on his gilded carriage . He had a little white scar like a question mark on his right cheek . He got it killing Frenchmen . He seemed to hold the world like a gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the asking ! All ! We are his last relations in the world ! p. 28 CLERGYMAN No one will dispute your claim . ROBIN The Major said he was the King 's intelligence in Massachusetts . CLERGYMAN No one will dispute his claim . What shall we do with people ? They get worse and worse , but God improves . God was green in Moses ' time ; little by little though , he blossomed . First came the prophets , then our Lord , and then the Church . ROBIN The Church ? CLERGYMAN The Church gets more enlightened every day . We 've learned to disregard the Law and look at persons . Who is my neighbor ? Anyone human is my neighbor . Sometimes my neighbor is a man from Sodom . Great noise of shouting . ALL FORMER CHARACTERS , except the MAN WITH THE MASK , parade across the stage . MOST OF THEM wave Rattlesnake flags ROBIN Father , I see two clergymen , they 're waving flags .

The PEOPLE sing a verse of Yankee Doodle , and draw COLONEL GREENOUGH on stage in a red , white and blue cart . He stands up and draws his sword .
