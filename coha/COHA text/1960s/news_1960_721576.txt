txt PARIS , Dec. ** is improbable that many U. N. envoys discern the reality of- what General de Gaulle wishes to achieve in disputed Algeria . They can hardly be blamed . France 's , President , for delicate political reasons , has deliberately obscured his plan behind a screen of Delphic utterances . What he apparently desires is to give Algerians of all races and religions a co7independence similar to that offered France itself by England in 1940 . After the collapse of the Maginot Line on June 9 of that year , Churchill proposed a " Declaration for a Franco-British Union ! ' ' It guaranteed common citizenship and joint organs for ' defense , foreign , financial and economic polity . The Reynaud Cabinet , however , disillusioned by the disintegration of its armed forces , , rejected this idea . Churchill 's was of course a desperate wartime measure aimed at keeping France in the struggle against Hitler . Furthermore , there is no indication that the present French Government is actually aware of the striking similarity between its program for Algeria and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this strange intellectual ghost nd'w seeks to venture south . I have discussed the French plan with the most competent authorities '  --  and " most competent " has a particular connotation here . There is no doubt about de Gaulle 's hope . His hope is that piecemeal , region by region , peace can be established in Algeria , that the rebel National Liberation Front ( F. L. N. ) can be induced to join with other population elements and at least agree to coindependence with France . Such a state would have its own legislature , cabinet , chief ; its own diplomatic service , U. N. representation and defense forces . But , as a younger sister , it would be almost interchangeably linked with France . Furthermore , should this system eventually not work out , the younger sister could sever the last family tie . The trouble with this concept is that it requires philosophical calm to stand a fair chance of success . This was the case in 1940 when a defeatist French nation was disinclined to align itself with Britain . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Algerian. nation is disinclined . The F. L. N. sees in de Gaulle 's scheme just another version of the discarded " integration " project for preserving French domination . De Gaulle 's Delphic utterances , so subject to misinterpretation , make inadequate explanation . In a world where external forces played a lesser role , de Gaulle 's would be a sane solution . But since last spring 's abortive summit , Russia has joined China in encouraging the F. L. N. It suits Moscow 's purposes to prolong the rebellion which weakens France and NATO . The promise i of new arms to the insurgents , the effort to ' gain greater influence in neighboring Morocco , and the veto of Mauritania 's admission to U. N. are all part of this picture . If these influences prevail , the result will be either continued warfare or , if de Gaulle pressers his search for settlement , another uprising of European settlers along the coastal plain . The latter ig now cooking . And de Gaulle himself hints that , should Algerian majority opinion insist on cutting all French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such partition would inevitably start by de facto proclamation of a separate " European " state binning along the coast from Algiers to the Moroccan border . That would bring ' about the equivalent of a . " French Israel . " And , should this occur , pessimists predict that other " independent " states would spring up elsewhere , for example in mountainous Kabylia . Algeria could become as chaotic as Yugoslavia during its wartime occupation . These eventualities should he earnestly pondered by U. N. ' It must not be forgotten that most Metropolitan Frenchmen want to end the war , by any means and that many Algerian Moslems share this sentiment . But Algerian Frenchmen are guided by ' ' ' Right-Wing extremists who prefer anarchy to peace ; and a growing extremist movement in the F. L. N. favors war over anything short of complete French capitulation , something France 's army will , not accept .

It would be folly were U. N. , which already has its fill of problems , to seize this moment to interfere .
