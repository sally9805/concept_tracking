For centuries , caste-bound Britain regarded higher learning as a rite of the rich and a privilege of the few . Even by 1945 , only one-tenth of 1% of the population attended universities-mainly the well born , who " went up " to Oxford and Cambridge and on to the " Establishment " that runs English culture and politics . But in 1948 came a dramatic change : for any poor youngster with a rich mind , Britain 's welfare state promised a free university education through a vast system of scholarships . " For the first time , " recalls Eton 's Headmaster Robert Birley , " the working class realized that universities belonged just as much to it as to the ' others . ' " <P> The result is a race for college more intense than the current U.S. competition . Though enrollment is still only two-tenths of 1% of the population ( v. 2% in the U.S. ) , it has more than doubled since 1948 , to 103,000 ; in four years , it may hit 175,000 .

Sprouting between steel mills and shipyards , in grimy Liverpool , Manchester or Nottingham , redbricks* were originally founded to nurture local talents . Amenities were few : Leicester 's main building ( sooty yellow brick ) was once the county asylum ; the library still has padded cells . Redbrick graduates , generally 9-to-5 commuter students with no chance for donnish tea and tutorials , were hardly considered " educated " - though they included such talents as Novelists D. H. Lawrence ( Nottingham ) and C. P. Snow ( Leicester ) . Oxbridge so scorned the breed that to this day it insists on calling redbrick Ph.D.s " Mr. " <P> <P> Now full-scale national universities , redbricks are so besieged that they can accept only one out of seven applicants . Desperately , they are building airy glass-and-steel buildings without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for physics at Hull , for engineering at Liverpool . Entire new universities are due in Brighton , York and Norwich ; four more are on paper from Coventry to Canterbury . Last week , Lancashire joined the queue of counties that want their own universities . <P> Something Missing . Redbricks have already surged ahead in many fields . Oxbridge has nothing like Manchester 's electrical-engineering course . Bristol 's physics and English are tops ; so is metallurgy at Birmingham . Many redbrick universities are superior in modern languages , and three of them have chairs in modern American literature . " At Oxbridge , " sniffs one schoolmaster , " they teach such rarefied English literature that only recently have they reached 1900. "
