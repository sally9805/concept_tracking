It comes over us now how seldom , these past three years , we admitted to ourselves how heavily our hopes were riding on one man . This journal was a devoted critic of John F. Kennedy . It spoke for his nomination as the Democratic candidate in 1960 , admired his re ? straint , respected his intellect , regretted the evasions and hesitations that political realities seemed to command , and hoped for his re ? election and a new Congress more hospitable to his program . Lyndon B. Johnson is the inheritor of the youthful promise John Kennedy brought to people throughout the world . He is Texas , but the Texas of Sam Rayburn , not H. L. Hunt . He carries to the White House the impulses of his youth , which was lived in the years of the New Deal . His sympathies as well as his friendships were formed in that time when millions of Americans were poor and scared and demanding that the federal government take a real interest in them . A year before the 196o primaries , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be President as any other candidate ? " except possibly Lyndon . " That was Kennedy 's respect for expertise . The new President is described as pragmatic , as " operational from head to toe . " He is a practiced negotiator of bargains , a politician who takes pride in fine calculations of the feasible . He can not be stampeded . During that awful day , twenty-four hours after the assassination , when , in the corridors of the White House , all was confusion , Mr. Johnson confidently met one problem , one person after another ; he was at ease ; he seemed , one of those present said , " a man the Presi ? dential chair fits . " To his gifts as a legislative tactician , there must now be added the intangible gift without which no President can succeed , the gift of discerning not only what seems possible , but also that which sober judgment deems imperative ; and the talent too of persuasiveness , so that good intentions and ambitions can be , as the President told Con ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are demanding months ahead ; one hopes they will be pro ? ductive months . The President needs votes , not just sympathy , in Congress ; and when partisanship and sectionalism have had a chance to draw breath , votes cast against Kennedy will be cast against him . Still , this is a new beginning , and we look to the future ? with only one final backward glance . The few on whom the burden of tragedy was heaviest never for one moment faltered . Nothing became the Kennedy Administration more than the dignity of its last weekend . Allies at the Funeral And adversaries too : President Johnson 's 55 minutes with Mikoyan meant that the West German President and West German Chancellor were kept waiting 3o minutes . The Europeans came to look at the cowboy in the White House . What foreigners fancy they sense in Mr. Johnson is a lack of feel for the complexities of the modern world , despite daily briefings of the new President these past three years and his attendance at meetings of the Na ? tional Security Council . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark Epernay 's advice , that the es ? sence of political prudence is to act in any situation as nearly as possible as was done before . Later , of course , the President will have to work out his own course , unless he wants this country to have another John Foster Dulles , a role Dean Rusk would not relish or be good in anyway . The President 's word to General de Gaulle , to Dr. Erhard and to the new British Prime Minister , Sir Alec Douglas Home , was essentially the same in each case : " Come back later , and then we 'll talk . " Erhard and Douglas Home certainly , probably de Gaulle also , will return early in the new year . This does not give Lyndon Johnson much time for indispensable thinking , but it is as much time as he is ever likely to have . Will Mikoyan also return ? This seems unlikely , as does a Johnson ? Khrushchev summit meeting next year unless , as the British plainly hope , some real progress is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , airfields and railroads in the Soviet Union , the United States , and Eastern and Western Europe , to guard against a surprise attack by one side on the other . What dilutes this hope is that the Russians insist on sticking on to the proposal such conditions as mutual thinning of forces , and a nuclear-free zone in Europe . The Republicans were trite but right when they said the week before President Kennedy 's murder that the Atlantic Alliance was in disarray . The trouble is that neither they nor anyone else can come up with the magic word of command that will reform the ranks . All that is known is what the allies want of the United States and what the United States wants of the allies . But hardly any of it squares with the rest . General de Gaulle would just as soon have American troops leave Europe , and declares with an air of infallibility that they will , anyway . The Germans want American forces to stay , and beg Washington to declare de Gaulle is wrong . When the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British teeter between deep dislike of de Gaulle ? he kept them out of Europe , which was unforgivable , even though quite a lot of them never really wanted to go in ? and their instinctive feeling that de Gaulle isright when he says that nuclear weapons have made large-scale war an absurdity , so that ending the Cold War through a detente with Russia by a settlement in Europe is now feasible as well as desirable . Any such settlement would redound mightily to the advantage of Sir Alec Douglas Home , who also faces an election next year , and seems likely to lose it without a magic for ? mula . His supporters are likewise at him to seize a unique chance to revive the winded " special relation ? ship " between Britain and America . The Germans teeter , too , between America and France . At first sight it might seem plain where their interest must lie . The United States holds the nuclear umbrella while General de Gaulle says he hopes soon to have a handkerchief . It was President Kennedy not President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ united Berlin in a Germany united by self-deter ? mination . Unfortunately , the very size of the American promise and all it might imply makes the Germans sus ? picious and afraid . Nuclear war may be an absurdity , nevertheless any move to unite Germany ? whether by the West against the East , or the East against the West ? probably would bring on World War III . The Ger ? mans know this , and know that Khrushchev knows : therefore the Americans must know also . General de Gaulle says they do , indeed , and scornfully declines to match a promise he implies is false , but offers instead a Grand Design , an honorable partnership for West Germany in an economically integrated Europe that will , he says , be free of both Americans and Russians . In the lo months that elapsed between General de Gaulle 's famous press conference and President Ken ? nedy 's death , Washington seemed to have no answer to Atlantic disarray , except to hope that General de Gaulle would go away . Former Secretary of State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as a political Puck , has proposed two interim answers : that the US not proceed with the talks between our ? selves and the British with the Russians , so as to stop alarming the Germans ; but that the United States also refuse to pay too much notice to de Gaulle . Secretary Rusk would heartily endorse the second of these pro ? posals , presumably , but not the first ; and President Johnson plainly intends to go along with Secretary Rusk , at least for the time being . Mr. Johnson when he was still Vice President once defined America 's role in a world of foreigners . He said the Ugly American was bunk , for Americans were beloved . He suspected that most foreigners wanted to be as like Americans as possible , especially if they lived in Asia and suffered from tapeworm . The reflection that most of them could not in fact ever hope to live like Americans inevitably bred some envy , and it was the duty of Americans to dispel this , as far as possible , by teaching those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1963 living . Foreigners could achieve this by adopting the free enterprise system . These remarks must be viewed charitably , as they were probably intended only to encourage Congress to continue foreign aid . President Johnson knows for in ? stance that an ominously large number of Latin Amer ? icans do believe in the Ugly American . The dignitaries from Europe and Asia and from behind the Iron Cur ? tain who attended Mr. Kennedy 's funeral were not matched in rank by those who came from south of the border . Events in Venezuela or British Guiana in the next few months could have a far worse effect on Mr. Johnson 's chances of staying in the White House than they might have had on Mr. Kennedy 's . Yet his foreign policy will mainly and rightly be judged by what it does or fails to do to East-West relations . When he visited Washington in 1959 , Mr. Khrushchev is supposed to have told Mr. Johnson : " I have read all your speeches , and did n't like any of them . " Plainly , sparks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the homely metaphor . They are so alike they even tend toward the same gimmicks . In India , Khrushchev wore odd hats ; Vice President Johnson ya-hooed in the Taj Mahal . to test the echo . A bawling match between them would be a fearsome thing to audition . Fortunately ; both can when they choose be as bland as card-sharpers . Perhaps person ? alities play little part after all these days in foreign policy ; all may be decided in advance by the vast impersonal bureaucracies that exist on both sides of the Curtain . On this view , another Soviet blockage of the Berlin autobahn would encounter a prearranged Western reaction with which the President would have had almost nothing to do . But can the same be said of a further Soviet thaw , if Khrushchev were suddenly to conjure up the appearance of one ? There will be deci ? sions for President Johnson to make . Whether he makes them or someone else does , they will be his responsibil ? ity . But he has already announced one decision : since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace and no vic ? tors in war , " he will not be afraid to negotiate . Around the President Those faithful lieutenants ? and not all of them Irish ? who helped Mr. Kennedy become President and were brought by him to the White House will make way for the Texans . While the President does not yet have a Ted Sorensen at his right hand to draft thoughtful and literate papers , he has access to instant advice from his contemporaries on whom he has called for twenty years ? Abe Fortas , Benjamin V. Cohen , Thomas Corcoran and James Rowe ? all of whom , like Johnson , grew up politically under Franklin Roosevelt . George Reedy , the Pierre Salinger of the Johnson team , is a former Capitol Hill reporter , plumper and less athletic than Mr. Salinger ; a political tactician but a policy man too . Strong with labor and minority groups , Reedy has helped peel the Southern label off his boss . It was Reedy who wrote Mr. Johnson 's cam ? paign speech to the New York Liberal Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Johnson and the David Dubinsky circle . Elizabeth Carpenter is said to be " a smart Texas politician , " competent to deal with a broad range of subjects , and not from any " woman 's angle . " She will be no ordinary press adviser to the First Lady , if that is how she is finally cast . Another Johnson man who comes to the White House , William Moyers , has been deputy to Mr. Schriver in the Peace Corps . Still in his twenties , he was trained in Texas to be a Baptist preacher . He represents the young Lyndon as the President would have liked to be . He is an idealist , but like all Johnson men , at home in practical politics too . Bobby Baker will not be among those present , and we can give thanks for what is not to be . Save for the recent scandal , he would no doubt be polishing up the handle on the big front door al ? ready . Being a quick learner by experience , the Presi THE NEW REpusttc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep out any future Bobby Bakers . There has been speculation about the new President 's relations with the Kennedy Cabinet , and a general con ? sensus that Mr. Johnson will encourage more autonomy among the departments and will rely , more than his predecessor did , on their advice . One does not know what his personal relationship is with Dean Rusk and George Ball , but if it is not already excellent , the Presi ? dent will put his back into making it so , inspiring the Secretary of State to play over his head in the coming months . The task is ready-made for Johnson ; this is the sort of bucking up and backing up at which he has heretofore shown considerable skill . The big Cabinet problems are the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury . Some big-city Dem ? ocrats , who came to Washington for the funeral , were already talking up Robert Kennedy as a Vice Presiden ? tial candidate in 1964 . Secretary Dillon 's status will depend primarily on what Mr. Johnson decides is polit ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few other special concerns , the President has always been " Rooseveltian " on economic matters . But he is as eager as Kennedy was in his first year to be the President of all the people , and he may decide he needs Secretary Dillon for the same reasons that per ? suaded John F. Kennedy . How Could If Happen ? It is a federal case if a postal employee , an FBI agent , a judge or a Secret Service man is murdered . But when a President of the United States is assassinated , it is not a federal case and must be dealt with by the institutions and authorities of the locality . In this in ? stance , fatefully , the place was Dallas , a city fiercely proud and pridefully fierce about its reputation . For two days the Dallas police had in custody both the young man without friends , and the nation 's good name . Whether by design or ineptitude , they failed to measure up . It was a local case ; the shame is national and people said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborators in irresponsibility . Legmen of the nation 's press , television and radio thronged the corridors at headquarters , intent to exploit the news opportunities , as they were charged to do . From time to time the prisoner ran an inquisitorial gantlet while being shifted from one room to another . Periodically , officials emerged to face microphones and cameras while expounding the accumulated clues , pro ? claiming the clinching of a case , and asserting con ? clusions concerning Lee Oswald 's manifest legal sanity . The revealed evidence included a life story charac ? terized by personal resentment , social inadequacy , andbitter revolutionary emotion ; possession of a mail-order rifle of precisely the type used in the slaying ; ac ? cess to the site of the assassin 's vigil ; a brief , violent flight betraying desperation and guilt after the deed ; tell-tale results of a paraffin test for the presence of burned powder on face and hand , and so on . Taken at face value , the case seemed strong , but such evidence is properly judged in a nation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrutiny . Would such a proceeding even be possible now ? Could a proper jury be empaneled after such broadcast ? ing of evidence and official conclusions of guilt ? Sup ? pose a damaging admission should be elicited from a prisoner repeatedly exposed to the pressures of the thronged corridors . Could it qualify as evidence in court ? What of the propriety of interrogating a pris ? oner in his undershirt ? Such thoughts must have risen in the minds of many TV watchers familiar with the law 's standards . The questions proved academic . Why wait for a grand jury to impute guilt ? Why wait even for a petit jury to determine it and to set the retribution ? The second idea flows , by a certain baleful logic , from the first . The hour for transferring the prisoner to another jail was announced publicly . The daytime hour was chosen , an official explained , to suit the convenience of TV . Between the elevator and an armored conveyance , he had to traverse a basement . Only police officers and the ubiquitous reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one malign exception . The type is familiar around any metropolitan police headquarters . He courts publicity and sports an alias . He often goes armed . He combines petty lawlessness and an inclination to violence with sycophancy toward the law 's officers . The policemen all know him . They are wont to exploit him for favors . Occasionally they pick him up for some such infraction as illicitly carry ? ing a pistol or selling liquor after prescribed hours . Such was the exception permitted in the Dallas base ? ment , while the world watched . No officer walked before to shield the accused man . Two officers secured the manacled prisoner from either side , the gaze of both for the moment intent in another direction as nemesis closed in . The target , slowly ad ? vancing , was open and steady . The first authentic mur ? der with full TV coverage was over in a moment , and with the doing of it the police suddenly acknowledged the interloper 's presence and bore him down . TV viewers had seen its counterpart before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sure that the event was planned that way ? Yet in what detail would a frame-up have differed from what happened before the eyes of millions ? These questions can not be answered now . They may be answered by the federal inquiry that is underway .
