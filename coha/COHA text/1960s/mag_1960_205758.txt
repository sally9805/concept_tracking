The sharp edge to Chairman Ralph J. Cordiner 's voice shocked General Electric brass at the annual management conference in Hot Springs , Va . last week . Certain G.E . officers and general managers , said Cordiner , had shown " flagrant disregard " of G.E . policy-and possibly U.S. antitrust laws-by discussing prices with competitors before they bid on big contracts for Government agencies such as the Tennessee Valley Authority . Equally grave , these men " had categorically denied any such acts " to Cordiner until months after a federal grand jury in Philadelphia began investigating ; only then did they confess to him . Some of the executives , announced G.E. , " have had their positions substantially downgraded , their level of compensation materially reduced , have been reassigned to positions with no responsibility for prices " - and forced to resign as officers . Others will be penalized soon . No names were mentioned , but U.S. Justice Department officials said that two G.E . vice presidents were involved . <P> Cordiner 's warning about price fixing might have been voiced a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bids . Last May it disclosed 24 cases since 1956 of matching bids-sometimes down to a hundredth of a penny-involving 47 U.S. manufacturers . On one transformer contract , for example . General Electric , Allis-Chalmers , and Mc-Graw-Edison 's Pennsylvania Transformer Division each submitted bids of $112,712 ; Westinghouse won the contract with a bid of $86,760 . This year , competing to supply 33,000 power-line insulators , G.E . and six other companies submitted identical bids ; G.E . got about 45% of the order . <P> So far , the grand jury has heard 75 witnesses from almost every major U.S. **26;13682;TOOLONG maker . It will continue investigating for another two months , then report . Said Cordiner : " Some of these associates of ours in G.E . may be found personally liable under criminal indictments which may be returned by the grand jury . Their punishment could be most severe . "
