, and then it was the spring rains , and then the planting , and the unseasonable heat and strong winds , and then they no longer troubled to lie , they just stayed away ; and Furber climbed slowly to the pulpit , and Mrs. Spink played and some sang , and then he spoke to a crack in a window , and crawled down after like a drunkard from a tree . He knew complaints were being made about him , but why had they sent him from Cleveland if not for this  --  to be a lash to Gilean , Gilean to be a rod to him ? 11Arid then by god he got them all back . But that was before The Noisy One and The Noisy One 's nesting hat and dog . Now it was touch and go again . Bark . Oh yes , bark away . They were a family of apocalyptic beasts . It was the fore-edge of summer when he started work in the garden . The work was idly begun , in a desperate moment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeve . He cleared the graves of weeds so their mounds were defined ; tore the vines from the stones , scrubbing their faces ; and then read the labels aloud as well as he could , beginning with Pike 's , for Pike was the first and demanded the honor . Rev A dy Pikewhen his church was a cabindie o his loveThe other inscriptions were stupid and dull , lines of sweet memorial cant , but this one never failed to lighten his spirit . Andrew Pike had been the first to preach along this stretch of the river , and among the dead in the garden , he had the only ghost who mattered . Stories were told about him still , by Tott and Mossteller mainly , by Lloyd Cate sometimes , by Watson rarely ; they were vague , confused tales , anguished and full of disaster , passionate as the legend on his monument ; and Furber began coming to Pike 's corner often  --  to redecipher the lines and ponder them . The Reverend An/drew Pike , when this church was a cabin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely only his skeleton now , wrapped up in the earth like bones in butcher 's paper . Furber wondered what it was he 'd struck  --  grub or worm most likely , hardly fly . It was strange the stone did n't call him brother . Perhaps Brother Pike would appreciate another cup . Cookie ? Missus Hatstat made them . Her first name 's Valient . Tott says she was named for her stays . Poor Pike must have bitten hard . The stone seemed to say so . Anyway he 's altered ; Pike 's fisher now . There 's the shadow of his boat , floating quietly in the corner , bulging the water . And here 's his line come down , a little curly . Furber bent over and tore off a tip of ivy . This is Brother Pike who preaches in our church . He has the voice of an Indian , Backett , you ought to like him . Howls when he feels the need . We 're proud of him . Those are the scalps of twenty devils at his belt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see who the darkie is . Have another brownie , they 've nuts all through them , I put in plenty .

This garden has been positively  --  refurberished . Want to wrestle ? Care to share a joint of cougar Pike has squeezed the life from with his knees ? Giants in those days ; now ghosts , now you and me . Furber rose and began to walk , rubbing his buttocks . The hour was passing . Then they 'd draw their wagon off . The others  --  Meldon , Rush  --  bragged of the number of their years . Thirty-five in this church unchanged since its building ; then Rush , exceeding even Meldon 's strength of jaw with forty-one . . . forty-one years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ordinarily they moved their ministersaround  --  a very irregular proceeding , this interminable tenure . Always conscious of what he stood for , what he meant and ought to mean , Furber roughed the dark cloth of his coat with his fingernails and paced off the flagstones carefully . Dusk had fallen . Several fireflies , by glowing together , had haloed the head of the chip-nosed saint . He had smiled in his grief . In the half-light , the stone was faintly showing ... it was Andrew Pike in his ghosting curtain . . . and he remembered leaning toward him drunkenly to say , ah Pike , breathe your spirit into me . Six years had failed to dim that memory . Six ? It was six , surely ? Somehow it seemed an eternity . . . the moment of his birth . He 'd sat there several hours in a kind of stupor , rousing to weep and to bite his hands , occasionally to press his forehead painfully against the ground , sincerely miserable yet vaguely conscious , too , that Flack , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensified his performance and greatly increased its range . He was boisterous , then silent ; he cursed and begged ; he confessed and threatened . He crumpled to a ball , like paper . He marched , cheering : heyheyhey . He snickered while he wept , and joked while he prayed . Spitting , he offered up his soul . Vain , he was humble . Proud , he was ashamed . I sign my petition , he cried , carried quite away , with my thirty mil/lion names . And I am lonely among my voices , these voices roaring in me . At last his strength began to fail him ; he weariedof it all , and finally caring for nothing , went half to sleep . Through his head , to the tunes of children 's songs , his pitiful beliefs , his little sentences of wisdom , danced foolishly as he dozed , the meters they were forced to skip to reducing them to a vulgar gibberish . He tried to rally his thoughts and form them in unassailable squares , but not a line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Logos wandered disloyallyoff , alone , rudely hiccoughing and chewing on pieces of raw potato , looking surly and dangerous .

Once before , but in an entirely different manner , he had received a revelation . He was eleven , still a sexless child , weak even then , with signs of palsy and an affinity for fear so pronounced that he had driven his parents nearly out of their wits with it . At that time he sought out terror as though it were a sweetly scented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , Mrs. Kermit Hazen 's bulldog would rushp104across the lawn from his customary place beneath a bush to snap at Furber 's shadow where it fell between the pickets . All too often they found Jethro lying unconscious there , and then his mother and father would embrace one another , weeping , wondering what in the world they were going to do with their child and why he had been taken with these strange demented ways , so cruel and unnatural . They denied him every book they had not carefully examined themselves , just as they forbade him the Hazen 's fence and later the stone quarry and the bluffs beyond town , and finally all farmyards because of the geese and railroad stations because of the engines , then funerals , cemeteries , zoos , and circuses , cellars , closets , attics , deep woods and vacant houses , athleticcontests , fires , rallies and revival meetings  --  indeed any form of public excitement  --  and they tried to shelter him from the noise and violence of storms , too , as well as from every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibitions proved of any use for he wantonly disobeyed them , and his father 's threats , his mother 's hysterical seizures , their hours of mourning and commiseration , since they were things he greatly feared , he sought as eagerly as he sought the bulldog , or accounts of cannibals in books , or the dizziness which always overcame him in high places . To forbid him the Bible was unthinkable , and since it was a book he might be safely seen with , Jethro Furber 's knowledge of it was complete at an early age . He read how they stoned a man for gathering sticks on the sabbath . It was easy to imagine himself in a circle of stones and implacable faces  --  the faces the worst  --  for had he not been stung by pebbles and knocked down by a clod of dirt and beaten , too , by his companions ? Third face : small and dainty , nearly smooth , the features barely pinched out on the surface like the decorationsof a cookie . .. tremulous smile ... tiny jaw that jiggles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehowscattered all around him . The people then shared outp105his clothes and other belongings , and his family drove the memory of him from its mind as he 'd been driven from the village . His wife , too , forgot him , even the touch of his hand . Why not ? a hand 's a hand . Was he a hero ? Standing disdainfullyin their midst , did he say : come now , who shall be the first ? And then : well thrown , good Korah , son of Izhar , playmateof my youth , friend in my manhood , neighbor and love . Or did he run till a rock broke his knee ? Perhaps he beseechedthem . Perhaps he fell at their feet and they dropped a boulder on his skull . No , here we are : he begins by begging . The stones come anyway and they sting . Why the amazement ? A fair trade  --  stones for sticks . He never believedthey would throw at him . Good friends , my kinsmen . But he must protect his face . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt and now he 's running . Ah , the fun 's begun . Go faster . Faster . Hurrah . Hero ? Unlikely . Anyway  --  to whom ? Once you 're dead there 's no difference , the kites are n't fastidious . He read how Korah , son of Izhar , son of Kohath , son of Levi , was swallowed by the earth with all his followers , while fire consumed two hundred fifty more . He read how Lot 's daughters lay with their drunken father ; how the Lord destroyed Sodom and brought the flood . He read how the Lord smote the firstborn of the Egyptians , and how , at the behest of Moses , the sons of Levi slew three thousand of their brothers , and later every male of the Midians , and their male children , and also all of their women who had slept with men , keeping only the young virgins for themselves . He read how Israel , at the order of Joshua , slew all but a harlot in Jericho , and how Joshua hung five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how a certain Levite , whose concubine was ravished in his stead by men in Gibeah ( for they were pederasts and would have preferred him ) , afterwarddivided her in twelve parts like a pie and sent a piece to each of the tribes of Israel that they might make warp106on Benjamin . He read how Saul and his sons and his armorbearerand all his men died on the same day , and how Uzzah was stricken for touching the ark when the oxen faltered , and how Ammon ravished the sister of Absalom so that Absalom had his brother slain , and then how Absalom stole the loyalty of the people from his father who was king , and to vex his father lay with his father 's whores , and at last led the people away . He read how finally Absalom was defeated , and how he fled on an ass and was caught in the branches of a tree where Joab , his father 's captain , bled his heart for the dogs with darts . He read how Joab spilled the bowels of Amasa on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown from the walls of his town to turn away the wrath of King David . He read how the Lord put a plague upon Israel , His anger consuming seventy thousand , and how Amasa was revenged , for Solomon had Joab slain , and how much in love Solomon was with foreign women so that the Lord took ten of the tribes of Israel from him and gave them to Jeroboam , whom , however , He later cursed with a terrible curse , causinghis son to die . These and many others . He saw Absalom alive in the oak and the head of Sheba falling from the wall and Joab 's sword entering Amasa . He heard the Lord curse jeroboam through the mouth of His prophet Ahijah : the dogs shall eat those of the house of jeroboam who die in the city , and the birds shall eat those of his house who die in the country , and all of his house shall be consumed as a dry cake of dung is consumed in the fire . He imagined the men of King David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheba looping over , and Joab running to catch it before it smashed on the rocks , spoiling its features , for the king liked to have the heads of his enemies brought into his presence since he hoped to find the meaning of their death in the final arrangement of their faces . Here is the head of a foolish man . Why does he smile so wisely ? Fourth face : small moustache and triangular chin , nervouslyp107winking eyes . . . something in them ? ah , he 's chewing on his tongue . . . wink tick chew tock , wink wink . You 've waited too long , now what 's her name 's begun , de dum de dum de dum de dum : we rise to praise the living God . Oh no indeedy . Incorrect . The third stone , reddish , small , flat with rounded edges and a glacial nick  --  the first two having fallen grievously short  --  was thrown by a ferrety boy in a sailor suit . It skipped twice before turning toward its target , then twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that he fell with a groan , shaking the earth . There was generousapplause and considerable shouting . A pillar of dust rose from beneath the body , two thousand sneezing . With the clangor of arms the armies collided . Yar . Yar . Yar . He saw Absalom alive in the oak . The locusts flew up in a cloud and the servants of King David saw them rising and knew where Absalom was . While Joab pierced his heart and ten men struck him , his mule was grazing . Absalom said , ah my father 's friend has come , my kinsman ; but Joab did not speak , affixing the darts . The head of Absalom then was like the head of Sheba tossed from the wall top and like Amasa 's who was murdered on the highway ; it was like the head of the Levite 's concubine sent as a message to Judah ; it was like the head of Goliath and the other stoned man ; it was like the head of Saul and the five kings Joshua had hung in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one by one into his dreams and held by their hair as the oak had held Absalom , all those whom war and plague and treachery had slain , each in the griff of a wan  --  ior , and all the heads were smiling in the same way . . . wisely . . . and Furber heard King David muttering , why are they smiling ? what is the meaning ? for head after head , even those with sad eyes or poor teeth , those who met death weeping , were smiling .

It was only a game called king of the mountain . A stone came out of the sun and struck him just back of the ear . Death in every direction . He staggered drunkenly down the slope into their arms. ringletringletwhere 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the later books . He was disappointedwith them . Of Revelation he was even a little disdainful . What this saint had dreamed of , Moses and Joshua had done . His book was filled with the wind of trumpets and the insubstantial wings of angels , and while there were cataclysmsof all kinds which the emperor 's prisoner promised would destroy a fifth or a fourth or a third of the earth , his threats were like those Jethro himself had sometimes shoutedp109from his yard at the bullying fat girl with whom he often played and who had showed him , as Rome he supposed had showed John , her private parts ; and in consequence no one whose foot would raise real dust in the road was deprived of his bowels by the sword ; for Furber had already read how King David had numbered Israel , angering the Lord , and how the Lord had offered him a punishment for his people : either three years of famine , three months of flight before their foes , or three days of pestilence brought by an angel , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : let us fall into the hands of the Lord , for His mercy is great ; but let us not fall into the hands of man ; so Furber felt , even as a boy , that if the Lord really wished to bring the world to a terrible end , He would not toss earth and heaven together or bring forth fire from the ground or roll up the sea like a scroll , but simply withdraw Himself so that the whole earth and the heavens beyond the earth would settle quietly into the hands of man . I have seen Absalom alive in the oak ; I have seen his neck between the branches ; locusts flew from his hair . Then a servant of David saw him also and ran to tell Joab . Oh preventit . . . prevent it ! But Joab has come in his gown of blood to bare the breast of Absalom , while Absalom watches , and find his heart . I have never seen the Lord God . But I have seen Absalom alive in the tree . Jethro was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wise adviser . Furber , too , determined to live for the church . But at first it was only the wild times and his own terror that attracted him : the immense stretch of the opposinghosts and the harsh cries of battle , the plagues and the engulfing sea , the cloud and the pillar of fire . Then one morning , his eyes still aching from an unpleasant sleep , he came into the parlor where the Bible lay open on a table before a window , its pages turning in the morning breeze , and glancingidly down he saw these words of St. Paul which seemed to leap from the page to strike him : " For the invisible thingsp110of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even his eternal power and Godhead . " And his heart stopped . There was an immense silence inside him . It was a silence like that which overtook the world while he slept . " They are without excuse . " All night he 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benches and the clapping people . Heads had been brought in , and David , peering at each closely , had asked him again and again : what do you see ? why is he smiling ? what is the meaning ? The head of Goliath . Laughing , David had thrust his finger in its mouth . You 're a fish past biting , old friend . Saul . Tears had soaked Saul 's beard though he was smiling . David assaulted the head with his spear . How long has this been happening ? Saul  --  dead  --  is weeping . And no one dared to tell me . The head of Sheba , caught by Joab 's running awkwardly , and Joab 's own , and many more of David'scaptains , smiling . What is the meaning ? The page curled and blew over . Furber had cried out : yes , that 's so ; while pans slid noisily in the kitchen . To Jethro they were trumpets . Even now , as he remembered it , his flesh prickled . That terrible night of heads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They began to groan and fall forward on their faces . David said : let us sing a song of my own composition. redredmaidenheadJanet 's no longer a boy-ohA man and a woman opened the flap . Jethro rose , shouting angrily : that woman is a woman of Midian . Who plays the harlot with this daughter of Moab , bringing this plague of heads upon us ? And he took up David 's spear , for David was weeping  --  Absalom 's head was swinging by its hair  --  and rushed down the aisle to spit the man and woman on it beautifully  --  bravo . David praised him , saying : you have turned back the wrath of God from the people of Israel . Then ap111strange head was brought in , a head without features , smiling , without cheeks or lips or chin , and Furber said : who is this ? what is the meaning ? and David answered : this is the head of Jethro , a priest of Midian , once father-in-law to Moses , and a wise adviser . His mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is the matter , Jethro , she said . This too , he thought , is a sign , even the smell of cucumber , and I must try to understand it . At the end of his dream , while he 'd sat paralyzedbeside King David , another head had been brought . This is the head of Solomon , your son , a voice said to David . King David rose slowly , his weapons falling from him . But I die before Solomon , he said . Shall I cut this child in two , said Solomon 's head . I die before Solomon , David said , his garments falling from him . Tell me I 'm not smiling . Tell me . I ca n't hear you , he shouted , his body falling from him . Tell me I 'm not smiling not smiling not smiling . . . But his head wore a smile as sweet and mild and rosy as the heads , for example , of Saul and Amasa , as the heads , for instance , of Goliath and Joab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joab caught so awkwardly just in time . Jethro gave his mother a reassuring peck and asked for breakfast : sugared peaches in cream , fresh milk , sweet rolls with sweet butter , whole strawberry jam . You 'd have loved my mother , Pike . Happy ? Proud ? Visiting ladies in elaborate Sunday hats shaded my face from the sun that came streaming through the parlor windows in the summer afternoons . Mother hugs me . He 's decided , she says , and they  --  the ladies with smoothed cosmeticfaces  --  smile and sigh . So young . And mother would always misunderstand them . But not too young to decide , she 'd insist . Maybe Aunt Janet would come away from the fishbowl . She hoped the fish would nibble at her finger . She said she thought it would tickle .

He does n't say much about it .. . but Janet , I think he 's had an experience . Pike , what if I 'd said : yes mother , I 've seen the private parts of fatty Ruth ? Would my life have changed ? Much ? Oh I should have spoken out . Shame . Not to praise the parts of fatty Ruth . Ah if I 'd had your spirit , Pike , when her skirts were hoisted up . Breathe your spirit into me. wiggle ohgigolowe 'll live so bungalowin my soft down belowuntil you drownPike speaks : ladies love religious little boys . By god Pike , you 're right . I was loved .

My face is muffled in my mother 's clothing . Her rhinestones injure me . See : my feet are going . Fish flee the forefinger of my aunt . The sun streams over the geraniums . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I am ? Aunt Janet sits carelessly on the edge of her chair , her hands like fruit that 's fallen in her lap . Her gaze is soft and watery . The past has overtaken her , just as you , Pike , have overtaken me . I was nearly twelve , you understand , and Ip114would search her eagerly like a lover . But her grief was all inside her , Pike . She might as well have been of stone or plasterlike that sentimental saint . And when in my room I would weep , for I was fond of weeping in those days , I realized my grief had no connection with my tears . Anyone might see how they streamed , but no one could know how they burned . Then I tried the private parts of fatty Ruth on my aunt and mother . Oh I was like the searching prince in Cinderella , hikingevery skirt . But they 've been badly misnamed . There 's nothing really private to those parts which I later heard the boys in seminary call the banks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's size ; for although all the girls and ladieswore it , none of them seemed nicely fitted . One day  --  it was sometime after my " experience , " perhaps three weeks or a month , and Janet had come according to her custom to nose our fish and stir them up  --  after her kiss had smeared cosmetic on my cheek and she had cocked her fist and painfullyspeared my side , congratulating me because I 'd ceased my shaking ( a pillow for your mother 's head , she said ) ; after she 'd lit on the edge of the simple ladder chair she fanciedbecause it was as light and delicate as herself , and had taken breath toward one of her favorite " ticklish topics , " since her conversation consisted entirely of prefaces , forewords , and introductions to pink tumescent subjects which she safely never touched ; and when she had , following an especially long and devious preamble to what I guessed was the problem of the unwed mother , sunk behind the sea which rose suddenly in her eyes as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are you awake ?  --  I saw her , poised on the edge of her chair as I 've said her habit was , let go and slowly topple over . We helped her up at once , of course . She did n't seem hurt or even ill . Slipped off , my mother said , because she has to perch and never minds what she 's doing . You may think it 's my diseased imagination  --  it has a beggar 's body  --  I freely admit it  --  but I see her still , whenever I wish , letting go and falling , her skirts flattening and streaming behind herp115and then ballooning as she turns in the air . I had penetrated the quality of the act , Pike , and I was dreadfully shaken by my knowledge , though I tried not to show it and got away as soon as I dared . She 'd had too much of life , and she 'd let go of it at last and left the wire . In my dreams sometimes I see her too , slipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her skirts rising about her as she descends and revealingbeneath them the private parts of fatty Ruth . On she somersaults until I 've lost the sense of heads or tails and she has spun herself into a single , broadly grinning , comic mask . Pike speaks : that was the face of truth on fatty Ruth . By god Pike you 're right . The head of Medusa , with Medusa'ssoftly whiskered grin . Were you turned to stone by such a sight ? Morton , I remember , rubbed my back . Humility , my boy , is also important . The hymnal he gave me was dog-eared at all the customary places and it always fell open at A Mighty Fortress Is Our God . Now there was a man who made a downy pillow . Pike . . . when I stopped trembling and fainting , the ladies wrapped me in their warm arms and cooed in my ears and gently ruffled my hair . Aunt Janet 's chair had skidded , tipping when she fell . Both were light but my aunt was voluptuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul . It was then I felt my whole interior shudder . It was nothing like the palsy of the body . I have that still . It was a fright of the spirit , a terrible ghost-fear . Hats shaded me . The petals of the potted plants were turning purple . She rose through the circle of my grasp , rubbing herself ecstatically against me . Well why not ? I was the vulgar flesh receiver , was n't I ? And was n't it all over , the harsh press and scruple of life ? There ought to be some sweet to console her for the fall . So she thought . But it was her limp spirit I held , as helpless , flung over my arm , as a wrap . This was my first use of the godly eye , Pike , and in the beginning I was no better for it . Beads and cameos and buttons cut me . Morton squeezed my arm , the dirty old butt . In the moment that we lifted her , I saw her estimate the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that means . She was ghostfallen , yet she troubled to guess how recently my mother 's flowers had been cut . Well I 'd declared for God , my mother said , and smartly dressed auxiliary ladies came to look at me and whisper about Jesus . A fat lot of good it would have done to insist I had n't chosen him , I 'd chosen the Lord of Hosts , His Tent , Tights , and Trapeze , not the same thing at all ; so I refrained . My prematurely wrinkled aunt held out her head . Its lips were spread with love . Now what do you make of that ? Pike speaks : in women revenge takes the form of religion . By god Pike you 're right . And I had mine . Faithfully I went to Brother Morton 's services and sat apart , not proudly or disdainfully , but in an absent mind , as if rapt ; and I dare say there were eyes that saw wisps of pink cherubic cloud like straw in my hair .

Pop pop pop , I 'd crack the spines . Oh Pike , my spirit was light then . How heavy it is now . Breathe your spirit into me . I do n't know what to believe . My luck has left me . I preach and no one listens . Only the crack in the window widens . Nar . Nar . Nar . Pike speaks : believe nothing that does not sound well . By god Pike you have something there .

My boy , to follow Christ is nice , you will enjoy it . Happy ? Proud ? Asleep ? Pike ? Do n't leave me , I 'm lonely . Oh lord you were n't a jew's-harp religionist ? you did n't squeeze an accordion ? slap your knee ? jig ? Not Samson , damn it , but my Kinsman , the stoned man , whose corpse is blind . What 's happened to the light ? Ah , Pike , the flies have failed us . That Mrs. Pimber has a strenuously knuckled hand , it just occurredto me to think so , not like Mrs. Claude . . . um .. . Spink , the fidgety , who is losing her hair but goes bravely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a bit of Throw Out the Lifeline , that 's rousing . Another muffin ? Do n't drip butter , the cloth 's so white , a beautiful expanse of something clean , and the blue shadows of the silver calm me wonderfully , and do n't you feel the coolness of the crystal and the silence of the porcelain ? No ? Another muffin ? coffee ? please cream and sugar . See the ghostly spirit spill into the darkness , clouding . Dunk ? Only on occasion . Mrs. Chamlay fries the greatest doughnuts ; you 'll love them , Mr. Furber . There 's nothing like country cooking . Well I 've always loved what 's large . The church must have a sale , a way to get going . For sweethearting charity . Cakes , clothes , and kisses . Prizes of chastity . Ice creams are such fun in July . Think of the long white papered tables under the trees . The cool mouth of watermelon . Pike , Pike ! rally ! rally to me ! Rowdies a rarity although known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Which was bought by Carl Skelton to sicken his dog . It was quite entertaining . I remember the bowl ; it went in her auction . Did n't she have some lovely things , poor dear . A shade of blue not too pleasing for chocolate . Who was it that got it ? ( Samantha has darkened ; her lips are severe . ) That fat Mrs. Arthur who moved back to Windham . And not a month here . Pike ! A desert , Pike , a wildernessJerome would not have dwelled in . He 'd have gath/ered up his books and gone to Rome . You lived with Indians  --  very well  --  but I 've fallen among people . Is there no one who will pity me ? Speak and say , oh great recumbency of sky , vast chest and hollow water bottle , would you spit upon your image , eh ? Ho , Barlar ? Grunn ? Petvich ? Hooloo ? Kishish ? Quarckaling ? Sull Yully ? Nannerbantandan ? TuK ? Too rooky , wo n't reply , all tweetered up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's have an answer . . . some bird of omen . . . no ghost . . . shreeeeeeeeeeee . . . The moon is falling near . Here are the deserts and the mountains . There I am , the raisin-eyed , cross-legged on a stone . Is that a lion feeding from my lap ? My spirit dines on salt and water . I do n't suppose you know the desert fathers , Pike , you were never a scholar . Well listen , you 've much to learn . A monk who lived in one of those Egyptian monasteriesfound himself set upon by thoughts of distant places , and the desire to leave the dry hole where he was and visit them began to torment him severely as you might expect , for he was put together in the same way as the rest of us  --  weak eyes and hairless knees . He told the abbot of his troubles , much as I am telling you of mine , Pike , and the abbot said : go to your cell and give your body in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will but forbid your body to stir . So the monk did as his abbot suggested and apparently his desires were quelled . Now do you see how wrong that was ? Dear me . Satan had that abbot by the heels . He had them all by the heels , even Macarius and Paul and Anthony . He swung them like a storm through the desert . Pike speaks : pounding the pipe wo n't punish the plumber . By god Pike you 're quick . I preached in Cleveland once upon that theme . You ca n't feel the spirit through the body , it 's far too thick and woolly . That monk should have fastened his mind to the wall and let his body go hang . There 's a betterstory , though , about the saintly Arsenius who was willed some property by a kinsman of his , a senator . Pay attention , Pike , you 've a good deal to learn . When the magistratep119brought him the will , ceremoniously phrased and piously laced as our wills invariably are , he indignantly refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did , Arsenius said , and now he 's dead , how can he make me his heir ? Yes sir , that was the ticket . He slipped the Devil there , and got scot-free . And so it was I saw the fall of my Aunt Janet from the Shaker chair . She died , poor soul , in the jump . Not howeverlike a saint but like a suicide . What did it matter if her body bloomed for thirty years and her face dried ? Age made trenches for her eyes . It might have been the source of some annoyance as the years went by , this sapling body and this withered face , but I think she saw what was coming . You have to peek under the covers , Pike ; then by the holy rood of Moses what you see ! It was only surfaces , before , that frightened me . I pledged my body to the fence but my love fell beyond it . And when I read of war in Israel , it was the bannersand dust in that Egyptian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kings were hung . All wrong . Then afterward , when the armies moved and the warriors grimaced at one another and shouting struck their swords together , I did not linger among the shields and weapon edges like a coward in the camp , but my eyes rode in with the spear . Pike speaks : o hemulous blarsh ! tole shemly kitch ! rah poffomouse twill ! Do n't mock me , Pike . After I 've furnished you with life , it is n't fair . Besides I 'm being bitten by these insects for your sake . What 's that ? Is someone speaking ? I 'll ask Samantha Tott to teach a Sunday school  --  now there 's a move -- a charming thought that 's just this minute come to me . Oh I 'm ill , I 'm ill , I 've chipped my nose , and nothing will restore me . Then make a clean breast , eh ? Throw myself , you know , like the bride 's bouquet , into their arms . My father prints a paper , Pike . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make myself loved like a stray . A miracle , Pike  --  life out of ink . Why , it frees me . Feeesh ? Who 's wise ? Who is it who keepsp120buffohoing me ? Is it you Flack , or these bloody fever bees ? Well , He 's a great comedian  --  the King of the High Wire , and He 's surely made a fool of me . Ill . Ill . I no longer feel , I only remember . Look : He 's lost His trousers . Say , fatty Ruth had a face on both her knees . Merciful heaven , He 's wearingred-hot BVD 's . Cherubic windpuffers , they looked like , wrought of hinge-wrinks by a genius : little mump-cheeked North , cruel smiling West . Thus appear the parts . What a howl by all that 's holy . Luff ? Who said so ? Oh breathe your spirit into me ! Pike ? Do n't leave me . Ill . Ill . Ill . Do n't leave . Listen . I 'm in your debt for six sentences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yield another and I 'll have no other ghosts before me . Be Lombardy Peter , Pike . Seven metals , seven wonders , seven ages . . . That sentence of Paul 's  --  I 'd almost forgot how it transformed me when I was nearly twelve and picked up Janet 's hair shirt from the floor . Tomorrow I 'm going to dig up the sundial and beat the body from that plaster St. Francis . Pike speaks : the way the world is , you have to look down to see up . You do by god . The thought turned him topsy-turvy . It seemed to summarize the whole worthless way of the world  --  if there was one . And versions of it began to flutter wildly through his head . You have to look round to see straight . Good enough . Useful . And the rough places plain . But all that 's geometry . But it measures the earth . You have to go slow to catch up . Eat to get thin ? no , but fast to grow fat , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail to succeed ? Risky . Stop to begin . The form made noiseless music  --  lumly lum lum or lum-lee-lee lum  --  like fill to empty , every physical extreme . Die to live was a bit old hat . But default to repay . And lie to be honest . He liked the ring of that . Flack ! I 'm white in order to be black . Sin first and saint later . Cruel to be kind , of course , and the hurt 's in the hurter  --  that 's what they say  --  a lot of blap . That 's my name , my nomination : Saint Later . Now then : humble to be proud ; poor to be rich . Enslave top121make free ? That moved naturally . Also multiply to subtract . Dee dee dee . Young Saint Later . A list of them , as old Pythagorashad . Even engenders odd . How would that be ? Eight is five and three . There were no middle-aged saints  --  they were all old men or babies . Ah , god  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods , roach in the pudding , prince in the pauper , enchanted beauty in the toad . This was the wisdomof the folk and the philosopher alike  --  the disorder of the lyre , or the drawn-out bow of that sane madman , the holy Heraclitus . The poet Zeno . The logician Keats . Discoveryafter discovery : the more the mice eat , the fatter the cats . There were tears and laughter , for instance  --  how they shook and ran together into one gay grief . Dumb eloquence , swift still waters , shallow deeps . Let 's see : impenitent remorse , careless anxiety , heedless worry , tense repose . So true of tigers . Then there was the friendly enmity of sun and snow , and the sweet disharmony of every union , the greasy mate of cock and cunt , the cosmic poles , the war that 's peace , the stumble that 's an everlasting poise and balance , spring and fall , love , strife , health , disease , and the cold duplicity of Number One and all its warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit that 's limitless . The permanence that 's change . The distance of the near at home . So  --  to roam , stay home . Then pursue to be caught , submit to conquer . Method  --  ancient  --  of Chinese . To pacify , inflame . Love , hate . Kiss , kill . In , out , up , down , start , stop . Ah . . . from pleasure , pain . Like circumcision of the heart . Judgmentand mercy . Sin and grace . It little mattered ; everything seemed to Furber to be magically right , and his heart grew fat with satisfaction . Therefore there is good in every evil ; one must lower away to raise ; seek what 's found to mourn its loss ; conceive in stone and execute in water ; turn profound and obvious , miraculous and commonplace , around ; sin to save ; destroy in order to create ; live in the sun , though underground . Yes . Doubt in order to believe  --  that was an old one  --  for thus the square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless ending . Soul is immortal after all  --  at last it 's proved . Between dead and living there 's no difference but the one has whiter bones . Furber rose , the mosquitoes swarming around him , and ran inside . It was six , surely . Counting from the moment when he took a spoon to his melon and looked along the row of faces , lips wrinkling , jaws in gentle motion , all in greeting , it was seven ; so six from the night at the stone was correct . Andy Pike did n't put up the church as she stands , of course , Brother Rush did that ; some of us think the original location was a little west of where it is now , Mossy and me mainly , I guess  --  you 'll meet Mossteller later , first-rate fellow , he was sorry he could n't make it  --  but people around here call it Pike 's Peak just the same , on account of the steeple , out of love for his memory , you know , not disrespect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Me and Mossy . If I tip my cup I may get a peek at the maker . Would he look like a lichen ? Nice shape to the bowls , they 're feathery ; my fingers show through them . Oh God what must be eaten in Your Name  --  not counting Yourself . That steeple did n't look any more than elm high to me and just a little shovel-nosed . Now that Brother Pike has rotted out his clothes and ghosts to the let of his halter , he 's old Andy to this bung-mouth . I 'm to see his grave too . What bores the dead are . I 'll bet a bible ribbon it 's Pike 's Penis to the barn boys . Well , like Sir Thomas Browne , I 'm great on resting places . Oh yes reverence really . I saw it from the train . Impressive . A round of watermelonslid from his spoon as he raised it to his lips . Falling , it tumbled from the mound of fruit and slipped over the edge of the glass where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie . They probably knew you could n't see a thing ahead of the hills . Why had n't he said he 'd peeked from the second story of the station ? Impossible . They thought he was taking a leak . There was , thank god , salt , but they 'd never heard of lemon . Actually , it should have been served over ice with ap123thin slice of lime . Now the melon was warmish and slippery . Poor season ? There was n't much juice . Too little rain ? And the fruit should have been laced with kirsch or drowned in white wine . His name was Tott , remember , something Bester . Telegrapher ? ticket-taker ? grocery clerk ? drygoods maybe , or real estate and insurance . He was some sort of pencil-licker certainly . Local oracle . Village idiot . Town pump . All kinds of containers sat about the table in sullen disconnection . Some steamed despite the hot day ; others enclosed pools of green brine where pickles drowsed like crocodiles ; still others held up mounds of melting jellies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let to drift among conserves and cheeses , and bowls of candied carrots , scalloped potatoes and baked beans bulged above the cloth , scraping sides , while baskets heaped with rolls were set among trays of cake and tins of pie and sheets of slicing cookie . God curse the covered dish . Curse this peasant Trimalchio beside me . Peasantfood was poison . Most of them , all of them maybe , just look at Mrs. Grimmouth , were temperance quacks , the worst kind . Piety of the palate . He remembered St. Jerome 's favoriteproverb : when an ass eats thistles up , his lips have lettuce like themselves . There was a little embarrassment at the platformwhen he went so briskly off to pee but really it was all right because he was in a sweat to see the tower of God  --  the spike that was to spit him .

" I will wash mine hands in innocency . . . " He covered his eyes ; his stomach gurgled ; he still heard the train . He 'd seen everything through a haze : the stack spitting cinders , the dirt smears dancing , the impatientflies . There was a landscape of flaws in the glass , footprintsof fingers , and he found himself traveling along them , ticking each off carefully as though they were squares composingthe perilous wandering path of a children 's game . It wound over blue-gray wastes and sticky rivers . The mirror bleary , the roses grinning , he shook as though riding . Dust on the sills , boot marks in the aisles , the car close and still , the heat profound . . . a passage to Hell  --  here , under the rose-smiling slope and the shoe-creaking stair , in company with the sound of water and the oppressive smell of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his image and he bent above the basin Proposing to Purify Himself in Preparationfor a Feast of Love ; he began to understand the nature of his destination and the extent of his punishment . So far there were significant absentees : the husband of the ledgechestedlady , for instance , and the husband of the woman with the fatuous first name  --  neither was present . Undoubtedlythey scorned him ; they hated his appointment , his having been so hastily thrust upon them , so immoderately squeezed between the rails of their objections ; and he was cityish too , quite plainly , sour and runty , with a handshakep125far from hearty , even , one might say , unmanly ( better that a preacher stutter ) ; and he had a noticeable general shiver , though these seizures seemed infrequent ; and he was pale , truly pale , like one whom caves have shaded . . . yes , overallhe gave the impression of something unwholesome and hidden ; he was the same species as the spider , bat or beetle , companions who  --  a class which . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was a determined gabbler , who knew what else ? or they were not scorners but the scorned themselves ; or rather , being husbands who  --  no , there was hanky-panky somewhere certainly , and rancor , you could count on it  --  petty local pride and fancied injuries , little intrigues like snarls of twine . Well his host was pleased with his , ah . . . dear me . . . his divers lavers . Better make no mentionthat direction . Wit and pedantry were out of place among these dreary villagers . Trees , hills , river . . . yet life was monotonously flat , straight . . . plankish . . . with a dreadful sameness everywhere like dust . .. a climate without any real extremes , deprived of virtue even in its mean . . . though there were trees , the sloping fields , the river , still life was hard , level . . . wooden . . . inevitable . . . and moments ran on mindlessly like driven cattle , and young men struggled in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while like dripping fish before wearingout their wills and settling down to live with the rest of the gently poor , their pets , and their obsequious diseases ... where bitterness grew up on everything like ivy . Yet the fact was he wanted their good opinion . Lord , lord , he was a dreadful creature . Why did he mind ? They were such small potatoes . How could they nourish him ? Furber grasped the chain . " Gather not my soul with sinners , nor my life with bloody men . . . " Bowels up , bladders down . Where had they got their money ? another happy consequence of papa 's passing on ? Turreted , scalloped , the clapboards patterned , the roof-tree edged with iron tracery , the house wasp126huge , with wide curving porches and a stained-glass window on the landing ; it had been built to be grand . He unsnicked , and stooping grotesquely , emerged . Somebody grasped his newly purified  --  " In whose hands is mischief . . . " People stood about in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the door , he saw the table , another landscape , harshly white , already cluttered with bowls and goblets . Were there really so many or was he failing to sort them ? He smiled and nodded and dropped his jaw like a visor . The ceilingslowly turned . Perhaps there would be blizzards now , tornadoes in the spring , and floods ; for he had always perched on the end of the teeter , weighing it down . The air felt like wool . Was it something he 'd brought with him from Cleveland ? The staircase wrapped itself around the inside of the tower . Of course . They were in the foot of the turret . It had a top like a Prussian 's helmet and shone dully in the sun like lead . These people could n't lift their feet . In the presence of the holy , their voices fell to a murmur , and he could scarcely understand a word . Death , doubtless , did it . Reverence really . That girl had brought it with her .

Held at the elbow , he was being steered . Hold on , you do n't touch the minister . Way up here ? at the head ? dear me . In the box : fallen air , prostrate winds , unmoving steam . The ladies struggling not to sweat , their hairy parts abead nevertheless . Deep in the tank , deep in the cage  --  descending . The light is failing . Courage , old friend . Waiting , his hands resting lightly on the back of his chair , his head alert to tip , what would he say about the food the good Lord of the ladies had provided ? Benedictus benedicatp127Pro Christum Dominum Jesus Nostrum . No loaves , no fishes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but relieve us of the beans . Devil take them . No damp cast-uponwaterbread either .

Is all in order ? ready to begin ? shall I bow now ? I 've come home to rolls and biscuits , mom , to hugs of butter and kisses of berry . Stay off foot washing and all blood and body . Cath-all-oh-cizz-zum . Love 's no sort of food though hate 's a tasty nettle . Love your mother ? have another . His hosts intended to sit on either side of him , apparently . His hosts . . .

The Husband of his Harpist in the Holy House was here , holding on his head and shoulders the head and face of some small mammal Furbercould n't place ; heavily cinched about the waist , no bones in his hands ; oh yes , there was the fellow with crepe over his eyes , the one who had the face of a man , as the books of magical secrets say , destined to die by drowning . That made two of them he knew . The Totts were two . Numbering is knowing . Bless these bounteous provisions . In an unctuous bishop 's voice . It was Christ 's own blood he was blushing . No doubt he 'd get the blame for being in between them . Betterto cry : I see shit in the soup , turds in the cream ; be honest and be out of it  --  free . Study their faces for a moment .

Samantha bent poorly ; he bumped the back of her legs . Not an old woman but an old woman . Then it becamenecessary to rejoin Master Tott . Furber was trembling with maledictions but there was a smile on the greengrocer 's face . It was the face of a . . . disciple . Smile matched smile . .. shared flame . . . dead heat . Well for christ 's sake are the legs stuck ? He grasped the seat and jerked the chair forward . Sunny grin and pleasant murmur . Honey bees . Storm of curses . Reluctant to touch the hot cloth , his hands hid in his lap ; the raw melon waited his spoon . My toes are dry though it rains in my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes are shined though . . .

Pike , the bearded beaver-skin prophet , scalps of the lost modestly shading his privy members , tiptoed savage-like from vale to glade , hatchet and Bible his only weapons though he held love in his teeth like a dagger , and he brought Jesus to the Indians of the Ohio country so that on Sundays they collectedat the cabin Pike had built on the brow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close by a clearing where he 'd previously set up a cross cut of saplings and a Christ formed of clay , and there the Indians , axes holstered in the earth , their loincloths dragging , knelt to pray by wringing their hands and groaning , eventually receiving a few brightly colored beads before they went away . Reverence really . He gazed on the steaming plain . . . the smoke of heavy industry : meats , beans , taters . . . Op129despair . Devil take those seeds . Let them have rebirth in other bodies . Their spirits seek too swift release , all out of season and intemperate . Haunt others . Off . There were some nice pieces spotted here and there , some lovely brown birds on an ironstone pitcher . A breeze in the foliage , their heads erect , perhaps they felt the well water through the glaze . Their beaks were in line and they seemed to be actually in sight of one another .

What kind of pleasure from her bony lover ? Damn , what 's her name ? Na , na . . . Knox . By covertly scratching her underarm not far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to roll so severely Furber feared an accident like his own . Someone said how elegant  --  what was ? what ?  --  while Miss Tott , sitting straight as her stoop would let her , dipped her utensil down and then away like the bucket of a ferris wheel , bracelet meanwhile shaking . A salad of canned peas and bits of cheese . Innocence no antidote . That emperor 's name ? he was a sixth but not the one who preferred the windup metal singing bird . Poisoned himself by bits and by degrees . Furber 's gaze slipped by the tip of  --  how to remember it  --  Mrs. Knox 's nose and leaped her pearly ear and swam into the space behind her .

He peered through his eyes at the other boys at play , afraid of the cool glass , his incomplete reflection like a boogie watching , or like God , transparent , evanescent , here and there . Good the skull held the head in , the caged chest in safety . He was master of the resting places . How ? Where ? These pacing cats , these bears , these songless singing birds , these slaty cases . . . If the soul has a body for its grave , graves are no resting places . I am afloat in here . The panes are smeared ; there 's steam in the air and the litter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cranked by his window . Cinders flew and flags of smoke ; the grass was gray ; the sun seemed large and orange though it was morning ; he bobbed lightly in his jar and the shadow of his hand descended on the lap of the thick young lady sitting next to him . There it fluttered gently despite its passion , scratching the smooth cloth of her skirt where a stripe like one upon a peppermint began describing the ample spread of her thighs  --  thighs which widened beneath her weight , he felt , like puddles of honey . He was sure she 'd seen his ghost alight and felt its brushing . With inflated cheeks , wool hair , sewn eyes , she seemed as tranquil as a dove , as pink and plump and smooth besides . Furber flexed his fingers . The head of a rabbit fell asunder . Her eyes were warming , were n't they ? Had he seen a slackness in her lips just then ? her breathing quicken ? Cornering , he watched her chest lift slowly while his hand paled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knee . . . thumb , forefinger at a wrinkle , delicately pinched together . There was a storm inside him , gusts of desire , intervals of weakness , rain . . . his hand flew off , then reappeared .. . again . . . He watched it anxiously , each time willing it under until he felt it sink to her skin . A sigh escaped him . Pretty pudcums . She stirred ; her legs moved lightly under his fingertips , down tickling , and his undulating flower bird settled in the hollow of her lap . Pet my bunny . Eee , sweet fig . His back was aching . He had brought her to the limit of her nature ; he was showing her unventured seas beyond ; shep133wiped her brow with her arm . Seecreeshun  --  oh my loveydolly . His fingers startled , then burrowed toward her privacy . The train lurched and as it whistled she rose clumsily , bumping his leg . His hand fell from the window , ah . . . he squeezed himself , weary . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttocks fastened moistly to her dress . A whore at heart for all she is a cow , Furber thought , and as the sun turned he tried to throw his outline under the wheels of the train , but when he peered out all he saw were the shadows of the cars and in them gray oblongs of window , irregularly splotched . Thus the china smutched the cloth . His own plate had escaped him and was passing wildly now from hand to hand . Master of the resting places . Had n't he this blackened clothing ? had n't he by heart the words for setting out ? God cast His shadow over him ; he was divine in his darkness ; somewhat , like these villagers , an ardent agriculturalist , a specialist in earth . That paten dollie could have saved me ? Why not ? Put your hand here , reverend , just while we travel , she could have said , and take your rest . Wrong ? Aunt Janet had succeeded where he 'd failed . It was only luck his image would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd be a cutout creased by the brilliant rails , cinders would pucker his chest . But she bumped me most unkindly ; waddled off . He shuddered ; heard the silver clatter . Careful . Care oh care . To sink down rest . Duckie . To touch . These faces all in tatters , words passing , glasses clinking , steam and condensation . . . He drew a line on his goblet . Dewy , cool , a drop hung from the tip . There was no law unproclaiming it . End to his lip then . Off hand . The taste of life . Proof of the labor in the glass . Sad testimonial to love . Omensetter 's luck , they said . Furber thought he could distinguishOmensetter 's noises from the rest . What good was a wall that did n't blind and deafen ? He could see and hear them as well as if he were on the beach beside them , smoking like a green branch against mosquitoes . Fingering the ivy hep134touched them more closely than if he held a still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a strange method of communication , skipping space and contravening causal laws . He remembered , on those rare occasions when his familyentertained in the evenings after his bedtime , how the sounds of their voices would tease and draw him , how the laughter seemed to him so wondrously musical , so richly dipped in something sweet , like jelly in chocolate sometimes , that his mouth filled , and he would creep to the stairhead , straining to make it all out , then smelling them too , their perfumeand tobacco , the fragrance of warm cakes and coffee rising with the click of their cups and spoons and their low bubbling speech , and once in a while a word would stand out clearly amid their scraping chairs and rustling garments , bewitchinghim . How he hated sleep . The world  --  how did it dare  --  went on without him while he slept , went on happily  --  this was proof  --  for everything he wanted and missed and felt should exist existed just beneath him , as close at hand while out of reach as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and woke and went downstairs the rooms would be stale and unfriendly , a forgotten saucer , maybe , would disgust him , and his parents would be lethargic , cross , and awkward with objects . It had finally occurred to him that he was the figure that altered the sum , just as his presenceon the beach so much later had subtracted from everyone'spleasure . So his family and his family 's friends were happy because he slept . If he died in the night as he sometimeshoped , thinking to punish them , they would not weep but would pass the hours of his death dipping cookies in their coffee , chuckling , and swirling cream in their frail scallopedcups . Tree , ball , wagon : they were greener , firmer , smoother without him . Hoops , the street : it was intolerable they did not need him , but when he lay in his bed they were more completely . Sleep was bearable only if the whole world slept , he 'd decided ; yes , we must all sleep together , that wasp135just ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " without his in the least understanding why at the time , had suddenly awakened the monster in him . Then he 'd cruelly scraped his ears and listened at the stairhead like a deer . He thought he heard their clothing parting . Certainly they giggled at the flesh they showed . He saw through the barriers of wall and floor the pale tangle of their limbs . Later he understood what people feared in fearing ghosts . Strange forms smoked along the stairs . Shapes moved vaguely in sheets . Holding his throat he 'd risen and wobbled to his bed and sought sleep as he 'd sought it ever since : as a friend and lover  --  further : as a medicine and god . Watchman . What a monstrous liar . He had n't stopped their games at all . They 'd stopped their ears so he made uselessnoises . Composing sentences he flew down . Kek . Is this a Sunday thing ? Ke-kek . Now when he closed his eyes .. . hullabillyhooly . . . what went on ? . . . that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are animals hunting in Furber 's inside . What will they find there ? what will they eat ? Lungs , liver , the kidneys , and watery meat . Much later than that lying moment on the stair , in the flower-decked pavilion of his dreams , he 'd made love too  --  to handsome monsters virtuous as witches , their bodies flung full length upon divans , rows of mouths along their limbs beseeching kisses , bald vaginas drawing wind ; for he was constantly deceived by sleep . Of course it would not give him peace , and as he 'd gradually come to realize it was his own heart he 'd heard on the stairs , these visions had enteredhis dreams to take their place . Sometimes , gratefully , he was a long silk multicolored handkerchief a magician drew with tantalizing slowness from his fist . Triumphantly , no butterfly more beautiful , he would emerge , and with a snap , unfurl . He was so slender the wind made him wiggle . Then the face of the magician would fall near . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nose . Behind the wall , farther than the stair had been , he thought he heard them clearly : Omensetter and his dog , the children and the jays , floating sticks and splashing , the slow lap of the water on the shore . Well my watch wo n't run without me . I 'm the works . Another one for Tott . Ghost , gnome , witch , companions of the night 's mare ( as Tott insisted , eyeinghim eagerly to see how he took it , disappointed each time ) : at least they needed him if they wanted to exist at all . Cruel , frightening , wicked as they were they waited like a school of playmates underneath his window . Often , awake , he would hear them call . Here I come a-ridinglike a wild west scout , if I spy you hiding , Pike , you 're out out OUT . Nevertheless , and it gave Furber courage to remember it , in all of Gilean 's amazement at Omensetter 's luck there was suspicion ; in all of their thanksgiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiration  --  yes , it would not be too strong to say their feverish love  --  there was no little envy . Well why not ? Natural . Who had n't envy of the animals ? He had , certainly , his share . They were the trunk of his life  --  these envious feelings . He 'd made his return on such a theme : Uncle Simon burning  --  the same theme that had earlierbeen his ruin , a poetically appropriate recovery , he thought . He 'd pulled out his pockets . I am showing what 's inside me : look . Right here . Toothpick . Corner of a coupon . Penny . Ball of lint . Then how he 'd preached  --  preached burning  --  and got them back . Pride  --  confessed . Arrogance  --  confessed . Error  --  confessed . Anger  --  confessed . Sorrow , despair , failure , shame  --  confessed . Contrition , oh yes that  --  confessed . He might as well have advertised upon his sign : This Sunday : Your Well-loved Preacher 's Personal Parts Ex/posed ; Next Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , faith  --  confessed . So well confessed he was invited to do the toothpick bit in Windham . Uncle Simon , of course , was too local  --  river reference ; but what a large career its burning had . Limb after limb , he said , the great proud church , he said , ulcerous and scaling , burned in the heart of the water . Burned on the skin of the river . Sank . Burned in the belly of the water . Burned . Moved in the blood of the river . Sank . Lodged in the muddy bottom , burning . Burned and burned . Ah , and they came like cattle , in droves , butting and shoving . Furber pulled at his shirt , undid his cuffs , releasedhis collar . And you know more of God than I , he said . And he recited as much as he dared of his night at the stone  --  oh legendary Pike , oh worthy soul-collector  --  and of the whole desperate time preceding , and how he 'd dragged himselfbefore them , week after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king of Judah all that time ? I was . I was . For I chattered like a swallow . Like a crane , I clamored , waving my arms . I moaned like a dove . My eyes were worn with weeping , with staring at my feet and at the floor , with the effort of going forth against new things . My hands were pinched with prayer and my ankles bruised . But He broke my bones like a lion . Day to night , He brought me to my end . No , by god , no tub-thumping for him , no rattling tambourines . He got them , even invented as it mostly was , with large words largely put  --  not a syllable of low speech  --  and he let this achievement quiet his conscience . When he had spoken , slowly , with long silences between them , his closing words ( the same for each sermon in the series ) : He brought me to my end ; he heard sniffling , and often saw a run of tears . Like a schoolboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knew how the orator , the actor , felt ; what they sought in their success . He could tickle them and they would laugh ; he could spank them and they 'd howl ; he could caress . . . and sighing , they 'd respond . He was an honestp138preacher at last . Through this thicket , now , he could thrust his stick to stir the soul . It was better , he felt , touching them this way , than all the ways he had imagined would bring on rapture if he had only dared to reach out to employ them , boldly to stare or boldly speak , harshly to grasp and greedily to seize : that knee , for instance , for which he 'd known such bitter regret , he might have moistened with his lips while his delicately socketed accompanist pretended that his passion was merely pity for her suffering and gently tangled her hands in his hair  --  how he might have made an altar , how he might have worshiped there !  --  or the crisp green girl who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry on such a sweet and holy conversation with him he felt licked clean and wished gratefully to embrace her ; or all those times , his nose in the weeds , he had lain at the fence , watching the croquet , unable to ask if he might play ; for fatty Ruth , or the plump girl on the train whom only his shadow had petted ; or any of the thousand simple impulses that hurled themselves helplessly against the walls of his heart : to finger the lobe of a strange ear or sniff on hands and knees a patch of something wet , make bawdy verses up and sing them loudly , leap in the air , chew on the thumb of a leather glove , play soccer in the street . . . any sudden gesture of joy or love .. . but who could know , when he heard his heart , what the beating was ? and who could be expected to understandthese gestures , so out of character , so threatening , for were n't they the same moves that went with rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter , it was all a dream , this rapture of touch ; you 'd taste the knee 's rough cover with your tongue ; the little girl would squeak and click her eyes ; your sweetheart would wet on your hand ; yes , words were superior ; they maintained a superior control ; they touched without your touching ; they were at once the bait , the hook , the line , the pole , and the water in between . He , Olus Knox , Chamlay and Mat were fishing , not getting much , but fishing ; trying the rocky point past the big bend ,  |p139not  getting much , but fishing in the very early morning ; the boat passing across the long shale crop opposite the clay bank , bringing their bait from the deep to shallow , but with no success but fishing ; and he , Olus Knox , Chamlay and Mat had nearly given up hope of fish and had got to that fine point of enjoying , as much as any fish they might have caught , the drops of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings they made on the surface of the river ; when of all things to see floating on the river they saw a large straw hat bobbing on its crown , spinning very slowly , movingvery patiently down between the lines toward the boat ; and Olus Knox said immediately my god it 's Omensetter 's hat , but Jethro Furber said immediately oh no it 's not , it 's not his hat , while the hat drifted to the boat , its brim brushing against the side Chamlay and Mat were fishing from , Jethro Furber and Olus Knox craning to watch it , no one saying a word more or moving to pick it up ; and the hat passed under Mat 's front line and passed under Chamlay 's and rubbed the side of the boat as it passed away around the stern ; then Jethro Furber took from Chamlay 's tackle box the largest , heaviest sinker he could find and lurching in the boat stood and hurled it into the hat as it went away . Then they drew in their lines and rowed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crouched awkwardly on the dock with the rope in his fist thinking of Chamlay 's sinker lying in the bottom of the hat and how the brim had curled like a yellow water flower . When the others had gathered their gear and the boat was tied , hearing the child in his voice , yet unable to prevent it , Furber turned to them with an angry face . Wait , he said , trembling all over , wait  --  just wait . Thus . Everything so bitterly won , lost . His words had flown like finches . Then the trap of those hands . Why ? It had been raining hard , the wind driving through every protection into his face . He had untented his umbrella , dartingfor the door . There was the glow of a white shirt . . .  |p140not  Mat 's . . . and a rumpled burlap-colored man . But no one was wearing a white shirt , he remembered . Yet a palenessthatched by shadows from the forge floated before him like a cloud , and there was Mat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire . Had he been able to recover the whole of that scene , even as dull as his senses had been while fleeing the downpour , he 'd have found the sign on it somewhere , unmistakably stuck like a poster announcingthe Ringlings ; but it was all so provokingly vague ; he 'd been taken unfairly unaware ; and there remained with him now only a few scattered impressions  --  the drifting light , the delicate lattices of shadow and the overwhelming sense of Omensetter 's size , of his boundless immensity , with the astonishmentwhich followed on it , and then the sudden inexplicableshame and fear  --  and even these had an unfortunate habit of mixing with those of later meetings . . . in the open air , in the hot sun , his huge feet shoveling dust , patches of sweat on his shirt like maps of the Great Lakes , the smell of weeds . . . so that sometimes he wondered whether that ghostly presence was n't simply a flash from the lake or a limestone jut or a maple revolving its leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that peculiar brightness were the sign he was hunting , the clown who burst the bright paper ring or the acrobat in silver tights , an hysterical smile painted on his face , who dangled from the trapeze by his knees . One Sunday , before the service and against his custom , where the people gathered , he went out to Omensetter , Omensetter 's dog , his wife and daughters , and he said , the crowd around him listening on , why do n't you come to church , you come to town , why not attend the services instead of throwing stones at the water ? and Omensetter smiled and said , why if you like , we will ; so presently they did . He 'd been a fool , a fool  --  for he lost his fire . Sin sweetenedin his mouth . The climate of the pit grew temperate and the great damnation day drew further off . Consequentlyp141Furber was convinced that evil dwelled within the pew where Omensetter sat , and he resolved to speak against it . No longer merely a grim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his finger pointing like a thorn upon its branch . He saw his open hand before his face , shielding his eyes from horror , his head thrown back and slightly turned away . He heard his voice echo from his mouth as from a well that drew its water from the center of the earth . Behold , oh Lord , your champion here , your fond believer , for Furber felt his body fill with resolution , and he stood in his study to make the gesture . He jerked his head and he arched his back and he raised his arms , and when his eyes lay naked on his face , he shrieked with joy . Yet when he came before the congregationand took his place and book above it , preparing his words for bearing on the subject , shaping his lips for strong sounds , his certainty grew a hesitation , his strength a meekness , and his sounds came down as softly as the gray birds building in the steeple . He listened to himself as to another man . He preached a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the faces of the people widen with surprise and revelation , and he realized that he was already anticipating the moment when he would stand at the church door awaiting Omensetter'slaugh , receiving his felicitations as he stood in line  --  you sure spoke my mind , Reverend Furber , first rate  --  while his own hand sank in Omensetter 's to its wrist , and his heart turned . I am inhabited , I am possessed , he thought . When the opportunity came he broke off and with great effort drew himself into his study where he swore at the walls and damned Flack for a sooty nigger . But the compliment he dreamed he had received from Omensetter , persistent as a fly , pursued him droning , though now the words were mischievouslyaltered so he heard  --  you sure spoke my mind , Father Furber , first rate  --  repeated like a chant of such spiritualprofundity its significance could not be caught the first time , and this further increased his already intolerable feeling of futility and despair . Yet by god Omensetter was ap142stupid fellow ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly about the eyes ; fat padded his face ; his hair was alwaysflying . His face was just another  --  the sixth face , that was all  --  broadly smiling , widely cracked across . The rain had been rebounding when he 'd ducked into the shade of Watson 's shop and nearly spitted Omensetter on the point of his umbrella . Was the man wet to the skin ? No . . . but that was the feeling he gave . Actually . . . what ? Tan shirt ? open throat ? button missing ? dry certainly . . . yes , wet to the skin , beaded , draining , flowering in the water like a splash . A curse on the gray light , on the rain that drove him in , on the foolishness that drove him out in it again to run so unbecomingly , so erratically and without heart , while he wrestled with the catch on his umbrella and stumbled through puddles , his dignity drowning in the tub of his trousers , the rain filling his shoes too and crawling down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tried to scratch between his shoulders his hat was shaken loose over his forehead and blown beyond a thin wire fence which he at once charged angrily and angrily shook , and it was there , with the wire responding in his fist , that some sense of the improprietyof his performance reached him , its futility struck him , and its folly . . . for he could be as easily observed , he supposed , as his hat could , caught on a stalk of last year 's cabbage ( indeed he imagined the signs brushed up , jumbles of bright red and blue letters that announced his appearance locally , from Friday to Sunday  --  he was the darkie on the yellow ground  --  in his famous role as a cheap buffoon , the small black helpless clown the others drenched with water , tickled with unrolling paper tubes and deprived of trousers , so they might implant their grotesque cardboard shoes on his flamboyantly checkered behind , then to goose to the accompanimentof piercing whistles and terrify with firecrackers and packs of little yapping dogs tricked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . its folly was of Egyptian proportions , it nearly brought him to his knees with shame ; andp143he halted himself like an army , folded his umbrella with a great show of composure , and proceeded homeward in a suit of the driest unconcern , head erect , hair knotted , lashes heavy , as if the spring sun were his cover , until , on reaching the churchyard at last , he bolted like a rabbit and threw a tantrum in the vestry , spilling his cuffs and denying the Lord . Looking back he realized he had unwittingly mimicked Omensetter 's habitual manner , for how otherwise would Omensetter have gone home through the rain , if he had wished to , but like one in his natural element , gently at ease , calmly collecting his pleasures . If this was a consequence of simply shaking hands , it made him a kind of deadly infection . I am inhabited , Furber said . Ah god , I am possessed . He would sit in his study for hours , searching his mind for some clue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he grimly called " Omensetter 's magic , " while from his window he would watch the pigeons wheeling to occupy his eyes . Finally he sought out Omensetter himself when Omensetter was strolling in the fields . Why do you inhabit me , he cried , why do you possess my tongue and turn it from the way it wants to go ? Leave me , Omensetter , leave us all . He came abruptly on the man , blurting out his speech before his resolutionleft him and shouting in his excitement , though the words came just as he 'd prepared and frequently rehearsed them . Omensetter halted and turned slowly to face Furber , who must have seemed to have lit like a crow behind him . The fellow 's eyes were huge , their gaze steady ; his whole body was listening , pointing toward Furber like a beast ; yes , like a beast , a cow , exactly : wary , stupid , dumb ; yes , as he thought back there was nothing in his manner that could be ascribed to an animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not come to church again , he had returned to skipping stones on the river where the people saw his exampleand said he was a godless man , while Furber preached against frivolity with heat.  |p144It  was truly astonishing the way his stones would leap free of the water and disappear into the glare . Omensetter always chose them carefully . He took their weight in his palm and recorded their edges with his fingers , juggling a number as he walked and tossing the failures down before he curled his index finger around their rims and released them as birds . Furber chose his own stones carefully too . In the beginning , when he had failed so miserably and lost his congregation , he had fallen upon the garden like a besieger and torn away its weeds . You 've been in mourning long enough , he declared , enjoying his joke sufficiently he repeated it to Flack who nodded without smiling and responded in his rich contralto : yes , he was a gentle man ; a remark which enraged Furber so much that like Moses he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let that be noon and midnight  --  there ; following his words with laughter to cover his confusion . Now he strode briskly from stone to stone , circling the sixty . How differently we give the semblance of life to the stone , he thought . And it did seem a stone until it skipped from the water . . . effortlessly lifting . . . then skipped again , and skipped , and skipped . . . a marvel of transcending. . . disappearing like the brief rise of the fish , a spirit even , bent on escape , lifting and lifting , then almost out of sight going under , or rather never lifting from that side of things again but embraced by the watery element skipping there , skipping and skipping until it accomplished the bottom . Pike 's nothing but a shadow himself , merely a thin dim swimming something alongside the boat , a momentary tangle , a whistle of light . The hat too  --  passing around them , turning , wetly bobbing  --  was due , eventually , to absorb too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw horseshoesthe same way . He sent them aloft and the heart rose with them , wondering if they 'd ever come back , they seemed so light . A soft fish . . . and the shoe might slip beneath the surface of the air like the Chinese sage , or painter was it ?  |p145who  disappeared into his picture , except that Omensetter managed this miracle for things , for stones and horseshoes , while doing nothing to untie or lighten himself  --  no , he heavilyand completely remained . Pike died of his love , his stone said . Omensetter 's stones did not skip on forever either , though they seemed to take heart , or did they renew their fear ? from their encounter with the water ; but despite this urging each span was less , like that shortness of breath which grows the greater , the greater effort is required  --  and plip plip . . . plipplipplipplish was their hearts ' register and all they were . Tell me , Mr. Rush , in that uncustomary country , are you comfortable by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , grows used to life too , swells to a fondness even , and sucks on its sweets till they loosen his jaws . Or do you worry whether your bones will be up to the next leap when it will be the end of you again , poor thing . . . oh well , the water will take you on , or the fire , though there 'll be new responsibilities as always , new risings required , you 'll never escape those  --  but were n't you one , when you lived on air , who badgered the body about spirit ? Ghosting 's what we 've always called for . Be above yourself , that 's what we 've urged  --  Pike , you and I  --  the hanker for the other side . We 've no reason to complain , then , if our crotch is cracked by a hurdle . But I wonder  --  youmight know now  --  is it a lie ? What ease instead to melt into the body 's arms and be one 's own sweet concubine . And Omensetter ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it cruel to tease stones so ? What 's your view now you 've splashed under ? Whatever he gives them , it lasts only a moment . There 's no help for it , they have to come down to a stone 's end . Furber 's heels registered loudly on his walk . Not too quick , he moved with the sun ; he threw his shadow like the gnomon , his absence warming , his presence cooling , the face of his clock.  |p146Name  his name , the missing fellow , so they said , sick so long , who ran from his wife , well almost certainly , hardly surprising , who could stand her ? after all these years not to remember , tongue tipped , yet . . . who could stand her ? though she had a strange body under those clothes , breasts with buttons , he imagined , stranger soul ; it was Henry . . .

Mrs. Curtis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which were a match for the beads . . . chatoyant . . . like Christ 's eyes . . . my soul 's eyes . . . and from Mrs. Hesiod Harmon , too , in for the weekend from Bridge , who kept her heart enclosed in heelskin normally , while residing with the Luther Hawkins family still at home , also from Miss Millicent Andrew and Miss Grace Cate and Mrs. Quentin Martin only moved to town a month yet socially as well ancestored as anyone in Gilean , and her daughter Eliza , lovely as lilac , whose hand she held , then Mrs. Emory Root with Lutie on the Sheraton settee , freshly reupholstered in beige wool rep by Mrs. Pimber working evenings till her eyes were sore , and further Mr. and Mrs. Claude Spink , as well as Edna Hoxie , fly that death drew , and Mr. Israbestis Tott , of course , who won the weeping ; while later , as the night wore on and the watchmen wearied , ginger cookies Mrs. Chamlay had baked were served with coffee by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , severe ; well there was some sense there , the mumbo jumbo did n't stir her , unless it was the stain of the beets , for it was n't Henry 's life that was the thought of the house but the bandaged hands the doctor would n't touch , the red pulse underneath , and the superstition that would catch it if he died , if Orcutt 's did n't , since death meant the triumph of the clergy 's , they were the masters of the resting places . . . and she was . . . that other was . . . she was . .. full , smooth , glistening , white . . . while life meant , in this case . . .

He stood uneasily in the door as though an unpleasant thought had caught him by the sleeve . The portentous questionstill held the air . After a moment he sighed to signify his resignation and turned toward Watson , flinging out his hands to indicate a kind of facing-up was taking place , another kind of defeat . He measured his tone as carefully as a carpenter and struck on his opportunity like a clock . For such a question , a monstrous answer , and he pushed his words by every objection , maneuvering his voice and body eloquently in the small space , bending , turning , shrugging , hissing . . . . It will be a boy if he says so . If he says so , it will surely be a boy . Sometimes , Matthew , sometimes there 's a certainty in things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's like the certainty that streams from God  --  like the certainty , I say , like it , only like  --  for this man 's in no way godlike  --  hardlybutit will be a boy if he says so . As I believe my God , because he says . I fancy I 'm considered one who strives to tell the truth in everything . Is there only vanity in that ? Listen Matthew , when Omensetter came into the church I could not speak in my usual way . I spoke in his . You heard . Were n't you amazed to hear me speaking in this way and notp150in mine , my hard and honest way of speaking ? Listen Matthew , I spent hours in my room beseeching God . And then I went where he was walking in the new fields , the corn a foot into the summer  --  let me continue , please !  --  I put it frankly to him , I asked him why he had possessed my tongue and turned it from the way it wished to go . I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew  --  and he said : " you would have spoken hard against me "  --  I admit it , this was so  --  " and that is why I 've taken all your words away . I 'll not be talked against . " Oh no ! Oh no ! There was a glow around him , Matthew , as he spoke , and his hair rose straight above his head and his face was flushed and full of the kind of anger I have no knowledge of . Oh no ! Oh no ! That 's what he said . Listen Matthew , he was in the young corn walking and I said leave us Omensetter , leave us all . Oh I accused him . I did . Yes , I said , you are of the dark ways , Omensetter , leave us all . He stopped  --  wait  --  he stopped , his hair on end , abush  --  wait now , wait  --  he laughed noisily . " I am of the dark ways , preacher , " he said . Oh no ! Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the truth in everything . Is there only vanity in that ? Then he laughed in that terrible long way . He said : " I am of the dark ways , preacher . " Yes , he said : " I walk the dark path . " Those were his words . No no , those were his words . They are engraven on me . Listen Matthew , listen , I went home then to our church and prayed to God . The days were turning back from the frost ; it would be warm again in Indian summer . The walk had lost the last traces of dew , his shoes were dry now , the grass no longer glistening though the wall was damp in several places . They were drawing off . He heard the ungreased wheels , the dog barking as it ran beside them , and he felt his anger subside . He ought to visit Mrs. Pimber , perhaps this evening . She 'd be nervous , of course , worried , and inclined to pour her heart in his ear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile as he marked the time . He knew what would be on her mind . She 'd groan and sputter . Owf . Ugh . Twenty bushels , half spoiled . Pumping her rocker . This settee . That chair . Jars of watermelon pickles , peach preserves , spiced pears . She 'd number spaces in the air and jab at them with her forefinger . Glasses of grape and apple jelly  --  how many ? Blueberries earlier , beans , beets , corn . Now it was pumpkin . More than last year  --  by preciselyhow many ? Completing her inventory , she 'd absently crack her knuckles . Pints of plums and cherries . Quarts of applesauce . Beside the stewed tomatoes , this many of the juice . All under wax and glass . Put up  --  the favorite phrase  --  preserved . Left from last year  --  how many ? Then rhubarb and raspberries . Given away  --  how many ? Henry does n't care for elderberry jelly , he prefers strawberry jam  --  nevertheless , how many ? Save . Conserve . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their berries filling , green , the stream . . . Furber waved his thoughts away . Always he fought to keep that image out : he standing , she beside . Lust was not the feeling . Lust was nothing , though in his lust he smelled continually of cheese . Lust was for little girls with scratchy underclothes . Lust was nothing . . . nothing . He should try to remember that Omensetter was a man like all men . Just another chest with matted hair . " Every one of them is gone back ; they are altogether become filthy ; there is none that doeth good , no , not one . " She too  --  Lucy  --  so bravely named . " Can two walk together except they be agreed ? " That was from Amos . Amos . They named the child Amos . . . brazenly . . . Amos Omensetter . . . hurtled from his father 's penis like those angels who were spat from the mouth of heaven , bad seed in bitter fruit , to topple through eternity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Out altogether . What luck . For the blasphemous thought he struck himself . The garden was stippled with sun let through the elms . There , Furber thought , was the real fruit of life . Involuntarily he stretched out his hand to take the bait . An/other gesture . Futile . And sometimes he failed to understand where his satisfaction came from  --  marching off the minutes on his clock  --  for he was driving his own life under , too , with every step he took . Furber is a sticky pillhe will make you sickhe willWas such spite in him ? He sighed . Another gesture . Spite ? there was enough . This , though , he would like to have remain : these pieces of shade ; was that asking too much ? He stopped abruptly but his heart went on , he felt it laboring . He eased his grip on the book and tenderly felt of his chest . At any time , if he wished ( and he always did ) he could fill his eyes with her . Was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Well it was too much , too much for mere mortality  --  these perverse figures in a painting of the paradise . Ah , Mrs. Pimber . Greetings . I 've boiled up six buckets of spying in windows with six cups of sugar and canned three quarts of bachelor love to warm me this winter . That should last nicely if I do n't serve it to company , it 's calorific . But perhapsHenry really had run away and she did need the clergy'sadvice and consolation . Chamlay had begun to speak of painful duty  --  a bad sign . They were worried , yet something kept them off , a fact remarkable enough by itself since ordinarilythey 'd have had their noses down like dogs . Now it looked as though they had waited as long as they were able . This morning Knox and Chamlay had come to stir him up , to tell him his business by god , and the hope he 'd heard in their voices had made him cringe . Curtis had been wrapped in his large coat though the grass was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chamlay peeled dead skin from his lip and flew it from his tongue . Perhaps he should go out . He was , after all , their representative . He wore their colors , bore their powers , exercised their rites . Consolation for Tott . Yet he had the fear that she would merely pause in her rockingp153and while humming thoughtfully tilt her face to the ceiling to calculate quart boxes of currants and transform them into jars of jelly . Under the circumstances he doubted his ability to bear it . Was that it really ? He might suggest she paint plates , she was fond of decorating chairs . Curtis , he said , what are you up to ? Chamlay looked away through the trees . Someone has to go out there , he said mournfully , she has n't said a word or been around to see a soul . That 's mighty funny , you know that . He wore a fur hat like a hunter 's . Thin hot face . Determined . Splotched . Knox on his arm like a cane . Pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings . Wait . What she pretends does not exist for her friends should also not exist , he said . For her friends . Shrewd thrust that missed . Everything missed . Then he saw the badge  --  damn tinlight  --  and his heart fell . They repeated their words  --  in effect , their demands . Nothing else mattered . They repeated them . Opportunitylike a hand to be seized and shaken . Theirs . His . Shake . True enough , she had not complained , yet she kept within her house , the shades all drawn , the doors locked tight , and Valient Hatstat said she knocked and knocked to no avail . At night , at the back of the house , the curious said they saw a light pass the shaded windows or heard the pump squeak once or twice , the back door bang . A few , more credulous , maintained the barn was sometimes lit , across its upperface , by the same pale and passing lamp . These were boys , entirely , whose fathers fetched them in . Pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact is that Henry Pimber has run away  --  out of Gilean , out of the world maybe  --  and his wife has gone strange . I did n't know you were a deputy . Shines pretty . Where 'd you get it ? Something new ? Chamlay'sarm extends . Fur hat . Whistles his lip skin . Someone has to . Knox is speaking . She wo n't let you in , but it 's proper procedure . Light frosts his glasses . Oh , procedure ! He 's gone off , there 's nothing of him anywhere . Fur at his boot tops . Wellp154it 's not that cold . Except inside . Why did n't they go away ? If he just thought about it hard enough  --  go away ! Chamlay slaps his gloves . Well it 's not that cold . Warm really . Except inside . Shamed and weak , Furber settled to the bench , the sun was cool . Up and down . Slap . Boot gleam . Slap . Coat fur . Slap . Hat fur . Slap . Go away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority from the county seat . Knox frosted eyes . Once taking tea with Rosa Knox he 'd had the same feeling . There were three little girls . . . running .. . and she 'd said : do n't chew your shoes . Over and over . Slap . It 's madness . He has Pimber under his coat . Henry 's not been right since his sickness . And so quiet . He used to sit like a ghost in a corner of Mat 's shop . Now . . . he 's gone . Like a ghost . Go away . Yes yes yes yes . Go away . His wife was ill then too . SIap . Not quite right in her mind remember . There , in the dark room , emerging from the froth of sheets , Henry 's eyes as hard and shiny as a teddy bear 's were fixed on him whichever way he moved . Knox nod . Official frosted glass . Please . What is she doing out there ? what is she up to ? what in heaven is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Boot ends . What what what . Olus Knox said ask her . Yes yes yes . Why not ? why does n't someone ? why why why . Because of the jars in rows , the potatoes in bins , the apples in barrels , the crocks of pickles and sauerkraut , the drying onions . . . Do n't be absurd . Because of the gourds . . . Do n't be a fool . Interview . The local cause . The sun was cool . And she was like an after-image still , a scar of light , a sailor 's deep tattoo . She stepped from a pool of underclothing . Oh Anthonyhad it easy ! Because he 'd seen the other Lucy mothernaked ( buck-naked , Pike , I guess you 'd say ) , yet who 'd believe him ? I 'm afraid the Reverend Furber 's not right in his head . It was n't lust that tumbled him . Lust was nothing . . . for schoolboys really . It had been  --  perception . His rage rose , filling him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have beaten Brother Chamlay flat as a footed apple . Listen . Then they kissed like needles . And hep155has a member , gentlemen , you might envy . It looked .. . infinite . Beneath it . . . a heap of thunderous cloud . It had risen with her rubbing as they shambled in the water . By its measure it might have been the massive ram and hammer of the gods . You could see it would beget men children only . Well , Egypt was easy on Jerome . And lucky for Macarius he was not with me . Is sin what I saw ? is that what burned my eyes and left its brutal image in them ? Then  --  listen  --  then , so full herself , she spilled his seed , and they both laughed like gulls . Furber slammed the Bible on the bench . No , he said aloud , rising . This is a matter for theology , not for feeling . His anger made him tremble . Nevertheless he straightenedand turned to address a host of cherubim , speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord God blessed His man and womankind and said be fruitful , multiply . But how could man beget unless his flesh would rise and what was there in innocence to move the simplest muscle in a gesture of desire ? Were men to love unmindful , below the beasts , like flowers ? It is impossible to know , of course . That moment has passed for all time . Yet watching Omensetter I sometimes think I 'm trembling on the lip of understanding it . It 's then I think I recognize the nature of his magic . For whatever Omensetter does he does without desire in the ordinary sense , with a kind of abandon , a stony mindlessness that makes me always think of Eden . The thought is blasphemous , I realize . And this of course is the clue , for more than any man I 've ever known , Omensetter seems beyond the reach of God . He 's truly out of touch . Furber paced a moment with his arms symbolically flexed . Sin 's nothing but exile . It occurs when God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He strode forward vigorously . Should everything seem fine beyond the fence , while we . . . Listen to me , listen , he cried , coming to a stop and holding out his hands , we know that men are evil , do n't we ? Do n't we ? Oh god have n't we observed it often ? have n't we bruised our eyes and stunned our hearts to dis/cover the hardness of that truth ? Yet Omensetter does n't seem to be . He does not seem . Seem . Is this correct , this  --  seem ? Oh you 're cows ! Is this the feeling ? I require an answernot a hiccough . Nannerbantan ? TuK ? Well he does . He does , does n't he ? Well ? Well ? And what ? And what shall we conclude from all of this then ? We must conclude he is the worst . He is the worst . . Therefore.  |p157Twilight  was moving through the woods upon the fields when the Reverend Jethro Furber , pebbles in his shoes , sand pushing between his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house . Trees divided the pale sheet of water on his left , while on his right loomed a bank of darkness like a battlement . The air was quiet , there was cloud , and all the sounds that human silence sharpens were , unearthly , stopped . The house seemed a deep extension of the trees , and Furber began to wonder what fool conceit or cowardice had driven him . He decided it was both : there was cowardice in his coming at all ; there was conceit , certainly , in the melodramaof the moment he had chosen . Now and then the moon appeared and bleached a path across the road . He heard a horse , and far away , perhaps in town , a lonely bark . The pebbles pressed against the bottoms of his feet . It had been a delicious pair of pains at first but now it made him wobble awkwardly . Madame , the clergy has come to call : give greeting . He looked about . The long lane was silent . The Holy Spirit has no better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he heard himself . Furber turned past the forsythia , wading in a trench of shade to penetrate the darkness that lay beyond the lilacs , and soon he reached the steps where he could see the neighborly gift of Mrs. Gladys Chamlay glimmering quietly in the moonlight and groaning from neglect . Though its shining is silent , there 's speech in the spoiling . Furber considered whether this expressionwas worth recording and decided against it . He raised the napkin covering the picnic basket and in the moonlight ants splashed like pepper past his feet . Leaningp158shame against fear , he removed one shoe at last , and in the moonlight emptied it of sand and stones , roughly dusting his sock . Since the leather had a tendency to wad , he shoved his foot back through the shoe 's high neck with difficulty . He then drew from the other an easing stream . Both feet comfortablyshod again , he tromped noisily across the porch and pounded on the door , startling a bird which rose angrily from its bush . Twice he called her name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet were subsiding . He felt he ought to stop and tie his shoes , but he had compunctions about kneeling . In the morning he 'd have more than a bruise . Attempting to listen , he went carefully down the steps and quickly toward the back of the house . In that moment the resting branches turned their leaves . Brilliantly , the still grass glittered . He found the side door locked , the rear door bolted . The cellar door seemed hooked . Ineffectually , he tugged and hauled at windows , beginning to wheeze . His heels were rising in his shoes , the laces slapping . Nor could he tolerate the funk he was in . Were there goblins in the gumtrees , ghosts in the cupboards ? He had no fear of spirits surely  --  of brooming witches , of gnomes , elves , sprites . Bear in mind : hate finds nothing hard . He ought to make a note of that . Nevertheless he could not ignore the figure he was cutting . Distraught , he wandered aimlessly about until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , he seized in a fury , attacking the house . By prying with it , he made a window squeak . Next he balanced a rock on a box and stood on these , the better to shove and heave . Yes indeed , he was an accomplished comedian and entrancing equilibrist , favorite of queens . At last he was able to squeeze inside . Something fell as he entered . Whatever it was , it did not break but rolled slowly across the floor : a-runk , a-runk , arunk . He could n't remember how the furniture was arranged or where in the house he was . The children who had spied on her , as he 'd been told , claimed she roamed the building with a lamp , but the place was cold , the air unstirred , the dark/ness unrelieved . He sneezed  --  curtain across his face . Now where are you , Lucy , he yelled , ashamed of the quaver in his voice . But he might come on her corpse . Swimming in the dark , he might bump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its fingers . Then Henry 's head might moon , his fierce eyes stare , the covers close about his neck like foam , and Furber would hear his own voice singing die in a relentless monotone  --  diedie die . He turned back to the window , terrified , bumping a chair which slid on the unrugged floor . Above him , on what he later decided were the back stairs , a figure appeared wrapped in gauze , holding a faintly burning lamp . Sagging , Furber uttered an uncourageous groan . Backett , is that you , Lucy Pimber said in a whisper . It was , no one could doubt it , a great stroke of luck , and the sense of her words brought him to his feet in a moment . It is I , the Reverend Jethro Furber , he formally announced . She fled up the stairs . The pale light danced as he stumbled after her . Do n't be frightened . Do n't be frightened . She extinguishedthe lamp and he thought he would never find her . Before he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his old illness had returned , and even his bones shook . He cradled the rail in his arms . He was blind  --  a buzzingin his eyes . Despite the grotesqueness of the wish , a part of him wanted to be mistaken for the huge hide-wetter who was so marvelously fitted and so universally desired . Another part did n't care at all about that , but would have been immenselygratified to have her fall beneath him , opening easily , whoever she thought he was . So what if her breasts were like pancakes . Nor was that all he wanted , for he was in a thousand careening pieces like a shattered army . However , when at last he dragged Lucy from the linen closet and obtainedthe lamp  --  she was a torn and dirty spirit , certainly , for she 'd fouled her clothes  --  he was nearly sickened by the smell of her , it was so strong and fecal . He possessed the lamp but had no way to light it , and while he stood stupidly considering this , she flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In pursuit , Furber fell on the stairs , smashing the mantle . Rattled , he shouted threats . You 're to tell no one I fell , you hear , smell-belly , he roared . You 're loony , you hear me ? You 're loony Lucy . He was beginning to see quite well now , and he found her hunched under the table in the kitchen mewing and spitting like a cat . Twisting a great knot in her nightdress , he pulled her out , saying experimentally , " I am Backett Omensetter , " in a deep bass voice . When he heard her chuckle he struck out blindly , hittingher several times on the head and shoulders . These blows rendered her docile , and though exhausted by his own emotions , he was able to restore her to the care of her friends without further difficulty or exertion . Not many days after , at the Hatstat 's where Lucy had been taken to recover , he was even able to offer her a good deal of excellent advice concerning the management of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time , of his stiffness , of the extreme correctness of his deportment all in all ; but Lucy Pimber , though she seemed as large-eyed as an owl and nearly as watchful , listened to his lengthy and somewhat elaborate monologue , despite the cold remoteness of its tone and the unflinching directness of its message , with a steady , calm , and sober mien throughout , for which Furber , more than once in the weeks that followed , gave grateful thanks to ghosts , elves , sprites , gnomes , witches  --  all of the disloyal angels , each of the fallen gods.  |p161It  was an afternoon of weak sun , the hour was late , and Mat appeared slowly on the end of the street . Outside his shop , as lightly as a water bird , Jethro Furber waited , and so observedreluctance enter the blacksmith 's knees . It 's lovely to be loved , he thought bitterly , rising to tiptoe and pulling the collar of his coat around his neck . Love . . . hate .. . what did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . His plans were made . His speeches had been well rehearsed . He had his courage and his anger up , his makeup straight , his costume fresh , its creases squeezed so ardently they gave him edges like a knife . Furthermore , he knew his man . That was a terrible thing  --  to know your man ; terrible , that is , for the man known , if it was true . And in this case , it was true . He did know . He knew . Mat 's imagination would undo him . There was coming toward him now , its body pondering , its temples glowering , a beast , burthenous with shadow . Furber winked . Mat 's shoulders were too heavy for his back . Frowns pinched his eyes . Undo  --  and a totter of limbs , a clatter of bones in collections . Oh he was always such a weighty man . " Yet His burthen is light . " But Mat dragged his shadow like a sled and fragments of dancehall song pierced Furber 's head . Imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , oh mel undo  --  for if you do , oh my ! untiep162then I 'm undone , I must confess ; I 'll simply diewithout my dress . He felt strangely adrift again . A shadow flew under his feet . It was curious  --  this floating . Better watch it . Hair lapped Mat 's ears . So if you do , oh me ! undo  --  so if you do , oh my ! untieMat was habitually heavy-hearted , morosely kind , distinctly dull in that sense , slow and gloomy ; his center of gravity seemed to Furber near his knees. consider that my dress fits tight across my chest ; has hooks and eyes , and bows and ties , has pins and clipsclear to my hips , Furber had withdrawn from his skin but he was still cold . Unhappy hands , fallen out of pockets , fluttered in greeting . Greeting ? The sky fled without moving . Mat came slowly on. and is difficult to press so very difficult to press . Yet somewhere in that ponderous person lived a lively fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear or a bird in a beaver . Thus Mat was curious , though a dreadful prude , and if he would gossip only when he felt obliged , he was frequent and unfailing in the discharge of his duties . He was fond of works of popular philosophy which he badly misconstrued , and once he had embarrassed Furber with a gift of some tracts on Eastern mysticism and the occult which he had acquiredwhile a carter in Chicago in his youth.  |p163If  you insistthat I divestthe dress that claspsme to its breast , and guards my honestness , and shields my honestness , Despite Mat 's reputation for having what barbers , shaving , call a light touch  --  a quality unusual , even irrelevant , in smiths  --  he regularly broke things : chairs , crocks , dishes , cooking pots and tools. then whatever you may do do to yourself tooHe was proud , in addition , that his thoughts were sometimes deep ; that his mind was , on occasion , devious ; that he saw through people , or around them , which was often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for finding affinities , however different and bizarre their outward forms ( Pimber and Omensetter were a natural pair , he always said ) which his friends pronounced both exact and remarkable. for that 's the golden rule , the golden , golden ruleTo Furber , watching Mat 's unwilling progress up the street , he represented the perfect pulley , for a gentle tug at one end would move a mountain at the other , or raise an unwilling Lazarus from the dead. and when we 're finally through , this maid shall ask of you , that whatever has been done , as a gentleman , whatever has been done , you redo . First , however , it would be necessary to get in . Furber had been standing for some time motionless , his mind asleep , and now both men leaned toward one another like two sticks thrust weakly in the earth . The street was strangely empty ,  |p164the  store fronts seemed painted on a drop , and Furber had the feeling that they might rise out of sight any moment , the scene change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a jungle . . . hummocks of snow or the restlessterrain of ocean . Through his uneasiness he recognized the need for strength and motion , and grasping himself , regainedhis stature . Normally small and thin , he seemed pulled by his own will through his black coat sleeves and trouser legs and stiff white tube of collar until he was as tall as he thought he ought to be , the total of his body and his shadow so completely cast together that Mat could scarcely have distinguished the separate figures that made the sum . Ah , Matthew , here you are at last . I feel a chill , he said . The lengthy ah , Mat 's name swimming in his breath , the ladybook language , the preacher 's tone : the stage . Standing too long , he 'd struck a false note ; his determination had drained away through his feet . Consequently Watson put his back to Furber 's eye . Mat 's shirt was stained and the sides of his face were streaked . Matthew , Furber crooned . Matthew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , filling his head with the sounds that meant smith , as if these sounds would give him some hold on their object . Did n't a man grow like his name in the long run , and was n't there a piece of him wedged in it , between the syllables , like meat in a sandwich ? How else could you know that the noises fit ? It 's what finally does those famous people in , his father used to say , wagging a long , plump , finger ; every time you 're thought of , a part of you gets used . It 's slow erosion . Death from simple use . Double U and T. That was his father 's life , his father 's motto . Wear and wear . And then we 're through . It 's simply Double U and T. Too much Double U and T. A hole pokes through , he used to say , as through a shoe . And then we 're through . Over and over and over he 'd say it , wearing the edges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall we do ? Furber was removed  --  giddy  --  all awobble . Another of his father 's news/paper truths : where are liquor and tobacco ? why , they live in habit 's hollow . Over and over and over . If each man were in his syllables somewhere , he could be reached that way . And touched . Over and over . Loved ? What did it matter ? He could be chewed and swallowed . Jethro , for instance .. . or Matthew . He knew true habit 's hollow . Omen  --  What if Romeo 's name were Bob ? Or Jethro . What if Jethro 's name were  --  what ? a wise adviser , a fluent liar , a slippery spier , a loud woe-crier , a God-denier with his soul on fire  --  no  --  what if his name were  --  what ? But you could n't wear out Romeo . He grew with each repeating . Omensetter . Simpson . Suppose it were Simpson . Or Henry Pimber . Or Olus Knox . A pig wallow  --  thatwas habit 's hollow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , bucko , with my spit around it  --  how do you like that ? Hatstat . Flack . Cox . Hawkins . Cobb . Well there might be something in it . Still another of his father 's newspaper truths : thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain . Were there one , He should have slain . . . Had there been , He would have . . . My will be done . And thrust the lightning home . Suppose God 's name was Simpson . Suppose , all this time , through all this hoot and hollering , He was Simpson . Unhearing . That would explain . . . everything . Hey there , Simpson ! Hey hey ! Not opportune . My name 's not Jethro Furber . You 've the wrong man once again . It 's Joe Pete Andy . It 's Philly Kinsman . What would that be like to be ? Kinsman . Any . To slip away to a new life . And so be safe from Double U and T. Ah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that man to a shadow , if this was true ; his name could only call a ghost . Silly Billiehas a bellybig as Margeand large as Nellie . Matthew Omensetter . The two of them were twins of a kind , Furber saw that now ; they possessed a terrible similarity , and he felt further weakened.  | ... the treasures that she carried were mostly deeply buried .. . To be Philly Kinsman . . . to swim in a river of trees . . . the sun asleep on the grass , in the weeds . . . oh god , he was going to die and never . .. the belle of the Spanish Main .. . Matthew Omensetter . Both were large-bodied gentlemen , always moist like river clay , darkening their shirts with designsas they worked , speaking in streaks and splotches . I shall never marrya maid who is a fairy ; she 'd be too military , and I 've no taste for war , or or for I 've no taste for war . Both were clay-skinned , too , their deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell untidily over their foreheads , though Mat 's was oftener cut and not so coarse  --  that was the difference . And I shall never tarrywith a girl who 's lost her cherry ; of her virtue I 'd be wary , despite my taste for whores , ors ors despite my taste for whores . Besides there was a looseness about Omensetter 's fleshy parts , not exactly unpleasant , he had to admit , not puffy or like skin that 's bubbled from the bone as paper does sometimesfrom plaster , but rather as if the muscles were at ease there , children asleep in their comforts " What do you want ? " Is that it ? Is it thus he addresses his minister ? with a you . While I cry : ah , ah Matthew , ah .. . while I cry : ah , the gospel author 's name , that name , you , instead , say : " what do you want ? " Well , he would not an/swer . He 'd topple silence on them like the temple . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fair , all of the Philistine people were there . I want  --  I want to be Philly Kinsman . Orcutt . Cate . Mossteller . Jenkins . Amsterdam . He recognized the wickedness and strength of the temptation , but he was sometimes overcome by the incredible sweetness of life , the warmth , the softness of his imaginary women , their skin so white and luminous with comfort . But a wise apothecary bid me once be charyof girls who tipple sherry and sleep the day indoors , ors ors and sleep the day indoors . In order to survive the silence he would have to think of darkly distant and dissimilar things : the Antarctic , camels , Bogota . Mat 's thumbs were hooked to the tops of his trousers , so Furber tried to turn his thoughts to the wood thrush , then to Sardanapalus the king . The blacksmith 's belly was large for all his laboring and it was puffing faintly beneath the cloth . Her nipples bright as berries , my maiden 's great mammaries , will yield milk like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or or till I 've no taste for more . The silence was a cross , but Furber resolved to share it , and he saw with pleasure that Mat had begun shifting his weight , leg to leg , like a bear . It was God 's work , God 's good work , Furber thought ; he 'd stand like this forever if necessary , like a holy image , though his church denied him images  --  well damn them and their dreary doctrines for that  --  all right then , like a mute accusing witness , an everlasting reminder .. . And down where she is hairy , I 'll cage my wild canary , a songbird legendary , till it can sing no more , or or till it can sing no more . Mat 's left hand flew to his face and clawed it roughly , then fell to his side with a slap . His right still clung to his pants like a bat to a rafter . Bogota . . . Bogota , Colombia . It would be futile to say : as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . I do n't matter . But remember what I mean , for the body of every symbol is absurd . Tell me : how did Jesus pee ? Who will preach on this point ? Who will address himself to this question ? Did He ? Oh yea , Sisters and Brothers , He did . He peed the same as you do . Certainly the same , Brothers . Fully as well , too . Yea , fully as often . A pale straw-yellow stream . It 's more likely He was circumcised than He was wispy bearded , weakly blond , girl whiskerless , a boy at twenty though a man at ten , a carpenter each inch a king . He was , in sum , an ordinary Son of God , the average kind , in all ways pious , meek , contentious , thin . Food wedged in His teeth , for instance ; His skin blistered . Empty , His belly rumbled ; stones cut His feet . Consider a moment the chemistry of The Last Supper . And when hung on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kiss of His nails than they did theirs . I can assure you of that much . Happy to do so , Sisters ; happy . . . so happy , Brothers . So much , too , you 're this God 's equal . He made His wind like anyone . His buttockscoughed , and I can imagine He was tempted , relieving Himself , to spatter the spider who 'd bit Him . His body made Him humble , yet He was piss proud . What sense to say He had one otherwise ? What sense ? But futile . Yea , Brothers. /bombaddybast . They 've scrubbed Him , drained His fluids , wiped up His colors , ironed out His creases . Beautiful Jesus  --  the embalmer 's pride . And Furber then , to pass the time , thought salt , thought dill , thought vinegar . At least he should look at me , he should have the courage . Myrrh . Myrrh . Watson drew air harshly through his nose . If he spits . . . But Furber could not take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , he said , briskly foldingup his arms . It 's late . I know it 's late . There 's time . Is there ? It 's late . I 've got a lot to do . There 's time enough , all the same . I 've got to wash and eat . I 've had a heavy day . There 's time , I say . Well what then ? about what ? But Furber secured his chest in his arms . Do not answer questions . He wrote " rudeness " on one side of a line . There was Ptolemy , Seleucus , Perdiccas , Gonatus , Cassander  --  all kings , and Furber cast his eyes down the empty street . They were n't real , they were echoes of buildings . It was as though the morning had been so exhilaratingly cool and clear and sunny that the boards had shouted away their substance , and now , from those earlier hours , only these images had been reflected to the afternoon . I think I 'd better wash . I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mat swung about and stared at Furber , blood coloring his face . Well , he said in a moment , squinting , I really have . He paused to tilt . What was it you wanted ? Yes , blink , Furber thought . You 've never seen me before . I 'm new , a stranger , and my dark clothes dazzle . Mat 's tonep170had altered  --  that was something . Furber warned himself to move cautiously , not to carry matters too far . This was a contesthe did n't dare lose , and his man was restless , uneasy and restless , anxious , worn , not just physically , but spiritually strained , worn and anxious in his heart . Yet he 'd have to go far to win , fantastically far , and his confidence was gone . It had disappeared the moment it was called on , despite his careful preparations . Doubt made his voice weak and Mat did not respond to Omensetter 's name . Ashamed , Furber repeatedit , but Watson did not answer . His head wagged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question flew in Furber 's ear  --  how much was Watson paying Omensetter for his help ? Could he afford such a man ? It might be a matterworth pursuing . But I want to be Philly Kinsman . Furber allowed himself a sigh . There 'd be loyalty to be undone , rectitude , Mat 's sense of Omensetter 's use , his antagonism ( and now that this had shown itself so plainly , it proved to be so much greater than he 'd guessed  --  but why ? why ? ) , and how many buttons more ? . . . faith ? trust ? belief ? each less , each easier , that , too , was something ; then plenty of straightoutfoolishness and ignorance , he could be sure of that . Not so simple , either , to free him from the mulewood he was made of . It was well Mat was weary , it would be will against will . Centipedes , he sang without conviction  --  waiting . Aphids , slugs . Then Eglon came  --  a Moab king . Jeroboam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ahab . " And Eglon was a very fat man . " He was surrendering again . It 's treacherous weather . Do n't you feel a chill ? The forge is banked . Mat 's voice remained weary and dispirited , scarcely polite . Let 's stand beside it , Matthew . I 'll be warm enough . A double-edged dagger of cubit length was well devised and gartered cunningly to the thigh of Ehud the assassin , deliverer of Israel . When Ehud was privately with Eglon in his summer parlor , bringing as he said a message to the king from God , he drew the dagger from its nest and with his leftp171hand , for he was an utterly left-handed man , buried it beyond the haft in the king 's belly , a belly so enormously fat that it was not possible to draw the dagger forth again , and it had to remain there instead , death 's bone driven deeply , while the king 's stools spilled on the carpet in the king 's surprise . At first no hue and cry was raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the king lay shut from his servants in his arbor as though ( as they thought ) he were answering to a call of nature . Such was the joke God made of Eglon then , and thus was Israel delivered that time . The doors , yielding slowly to the pressure of Watson 's shoulder , squealed . Then Mat was shouting above the noise . O . . . Omensetter did n't come to work . . . he did n't come to work today . . . he 's sick . . . I say he 's sick .. . his daughter came to tell me . . . came to say he 's sick .. . he 's sick she said . Oh ? Furber gathered to the forge . Coals lit the bottom of his chin . As the door rushed in  --  scraps of shadow , birding patches . Rehoboam , Abijam , Asa  --  kings in Judah . All of a sudden Mat appeared willing to communicate  --  good . He pushed his hands toward the fire . The coals were friendly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sear you at a touch . He tumbled his hands , scrubbing them roughly . The darkness was a comfort . Dim as a church , at the moment as quiet , the shop seemed a haven , and Furber , yawning and swallowing , smelled straw , then wood and leather , oil and old metal , manureand cooling water . He wanted to sink down and hug the coals to his chest . Flamboyant . . . coins of light . . . oil , wood , tatters . . . fumes from acids , soap , smoke . . . the sunlight shattered . He briefly wondered how it felt to Watson  --  thiswild rich place  --  whether he found any peace in its confusion . It was sad , but churches rarely lived so largely . They were seldom permitted such extravagance of feeling . In fact , they were  --  at least his was  --  a sour denial of the human spirit . He caught himself quickly . He 'd meant , of course , thatp172they were a sober condemnation of the evil in human nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notorious liar . In this sort of place , Furber could feel life opening out to him , the roof of the heavens rising in the darkness ; but it was the darkness , the deep obscurity of the shop that was responsible ; it was an illusion of shadow , and he realized with his customary bitterness that whatever his love was he could never show himself honestly to it ; he would always undress in the dark . Moving about the forge , he saw that Mat had remained in the doorway , and made out his fingers swimming in the barrel . Furber 's impulse was to fly against him like a girl and hammer the blacksmith 's chest with his fists . As you 've doubtless guessed , Omensetter is the matter I 've come about . It 's rather confidential  --  in my province as a preacher , Furber said , using the word with distaste , but , he thought , with skill . He 'd lost his shadow now , was small , not even thin , leaning over the fire . Oh ? Indifferent as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rudeness was complete , and though Furber struggled against it , he found that rage had swept him away . There were ancientcities . Think . Palmyra . Nineveh . Corinth . Mat 's indifferencewas a pose . Acre . Tyre . A performance for my performance . Issus . Damascus . Gaza . Rhodes . Now gone . All lost . He 's simply afraid . Persepolis . Nor do I appear angry , though I 'm burning like this hill of coals . Even the sleeves of my coat are calm . Merv . Nevertheless Furber clapped his hands so sharply and so suddenly , Mat jumped . I 've had inquiries , he said , concerning Omensetter 's signs . I meant to ask you before but I saw you were n't receptive . Oh ? Mat 's eyelids drooped ; they seemed to close . What makes you think I 'm receptive now ? Signs of another kind , Matthew , said Furber , smiling mildly.  |p173Oh  ? All those cities , those hollow houses , all those lives , those graves , the graves of hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bury that seizes men , a craze to cover that overcomesall of them , the cities covered themselves with sand and mud , vines , grass , lava , with noisier cities , completer ruins , further graves and further grasses . I am their proper lordship , Furber thought . My credentials make me master of the resting places . That was the way  --  burial to burial , shame to shame  --  it had always been since Adam 's fig had hidden him , his sex and death together and the same , and surely that was the way it would continue . He  --  Furberwouldbe lost in a swallow of persons . The stone in the corner of his garden would not truly speak of him , the great Leviathan would have him , he 'd be buried in their bodies  --  cover after cover coming  --  for that was the whole of life on the earth , our bodies for a time athwart another 's middle , our lives like leaves , generation after generation lifting the level of the land , the aim of each new layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mat alters the closure of his eyes . He also pulls thoughtfully at his nose . Like an actor . Yes . Deep in meditation . Oh yes . But in fact he has the fidgets . May his thoughts be pitch and smoke his wits out . It seems to me , if I remember rightly , we'veBeen over this before ? Yes , in a manner of speaking , we have , but I 'm afraid that we must go over it again , though more carefully this time , more thoroughly you know , more thoughtfully . Oh ? An enormous yawn burst into flower on Mat 's face . So I 'm to be the grave of my father and mother . In an agony of embarrassment , Furber covered his mouth . These damnable fancies were the curse of his life . Besides , he merely wished to be Philly Kinsman , an imaginary friend , orphaned for convenience , though no doubt a ducal heir . Butp174they are n't dead yet , they live in the South . He pushed his fingers between his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his speech was their inscription . HERE LIES . How could he have known he 'd rattle so ? MEMENTO . I had a letter last week . Friendly . Complete . The usual sort of news . No concern . No cause . MEMORIAE SACRUM . Scum . Pee bottles . But both are really quite well , and very active in the church . MEMO . With his tongue he 'd wet his fingers . MENDACEM MEMOREM ESSE OPORTET . What was passing through Matthew 's head ? Wind shadows ? the language of the dead ? Not the specters of his parents , certainly . Well damn them , if I 've got to have them , they deserve me . MORS JANUA VITAE . Then the memory of his mother 's enclosing arms and fragrant garments overwhelmed him . Flowers bloomed along her like a fence . His eyes were smarting . I 've been waiting for Mat , here , too long . It 's the shade the weather 's taken , and the time of day . MEMORIA IN AETERNA . I 've lost my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them once in a month , and here I 'm bundled in blue and fluffy flannel like a child in a crib . He started to chuckle but coughed instead . You 'll be the death of me , she 'd often said ; what am I going to do with you ? what will you turn into ? what will you be ? Spittle flew through his father 's teeth . All right , all right , die down , die down , but you 'll find no rest in me . MORS OMNIA SOLVIT . A lie . Furber groaned , securing Mat 's attention , and then he said : perhaps you remember the occasionI remember it.  --  but you seem to have forgotten what was said . I do n't remember I said much . All right  --  what I said . You do remember ? You have n't for-gotten ? No . But you did n't understand it ? No , I understood it well enough , I think . You refused to believe it ?  |p175No  , that would n't be exactly right . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watch ! Furber drew back , collecting himself , silent , noting that his rush had not made Watson budge . He hardly needed the forge now . His chill had been followed by a fever . Camels . That was an idea . Camels . Circumstances compel me , he said ; circumstances , you know  --  circles surrounding  --  they make it necessary to  --  these things which lie  --  which are so circumambient  --  to take the matter up again . I was n't clear . Am I clear now ? I fear not  --  no . Alas . Ah , but in a moment . I shall be then . Well . . . these cincturing affairs , eh ? they force me , you see , they make me , as a . . . missionary  --  for apparently I was n't clear before , andOh you were clear enough . I was ? I 'm surprised . I ca n't believe I was . Constrained as by a cingulum . . . Was I really ? Yes , you were clear enough , though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're both tired and it 's the end of theYes , yes . Agreed . TheLook  --  it 's a difficult time . It 's been a long day . I 'm tired . Done in . A tired body makes a ready mind . Mat began to protest but Furber cut him off . He had thrust both palms forward , and Mat 's veiled eyes had seen them . If one person is the grave of another , he wondered , what part is in the arm , for instance ? There could be a correspondence , I suppose , of arm to arm and nose to nose , but what if the deceased is a much larger fellow ? And justice would be better served in many cases , I should think , if the head of the dead one were hung down in the buttocks of the other , or if the heart of the corpse could be seen through the eyes  --  that would tell you something . Camel . Humpp176where the head is . That 's why . Two humps : two heads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A camel 's good dry ground and thus to be preferred for lying at any length in . Creatures of that kind will come high , likely , once it 's known . On such a chance , though , it would be wise to reserve one now . Of course cash in hand in a case like this is certainly essential . Also you could specify the place the camel , when it dies , should be laid to rest . It 's the sort of transmigration which might have pleased Pythagoras had anyone had the wit within his time to think of it . Clodhopper . Pee bottle . My name is Philly Kinsman . I am a famous bandsman . My fife 's my wife , but on my life , when I unease my trumpet , all the ladies .. . ( in these parts ) all the ladies .. . ( bless their hearts ) all the ladies hump it . Hell you say  --  What was wavering ? Darkness spinning like the seed of a maple . My name is Philly Kinsman . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonewhene'er the ladies pump it , it 's very sorefrom playing more music thanit bargained for , and still the ladies pump it . Mat sniffed , lifting his arm to his face . Light spread over the floor . You spent the day hunting Henry , I suppose , Furber said , his voice light and quiet , calm and low , scarcely in motionp177while he searched Mat 's face , alert as an animal for any change . How 'd it go ? a day of stubby fields , eh ? They twist your ankles . I know how that is . It 's wearing when it 's all for nothing . Weeds and burrs  --  they 're everywhere this time of year and very trying too , as sighting endlessly down rows of corn is , and poking in the little caves along the river  --  you looked there ?  --  depressing when it 's all for nothing ; and along the fences , the shocks and hayhills  --  you investigated them ? for nothing ? Well your clothes look picked and there 's a mean scratch on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account for it , I 'll bet , and berry tangles  --  damnable things  --  and that marsh ground , too ; did it wet through your shoes and wash your ankles ? a bit chilling , eh ? Well a nasty business all around  --  so very tiring when it 's all for nothing . Sure . It makes a long day . Gay songs and vulgar catches ... death . . . You do n't think that he 's run off then ? You 're not of that opinion ? He was an unraveled man , a doll 's sort , thoroughly unticked , unstrung , with no heart for flight , thrown by disease  --  isthat your theory ? and his wife all the while a flail , a handful of stones  --  oh I know , I know , he 's a friend still , though he 's wrapped himself in fronds to winter over like an ambitious hopeful worm , to see the spring , eh ? but as a man he was sunken in spirit like those rowboats you see rotting by the shore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rented Omensetter , gone to moss and weeds and soft besottedboards ... that 's the view you 're taking ? I know  --  I know your feeling . Hoh . I 'm a man of feeling too . Yet what was he but some vegetable that had n't reached her canning , some parsnip or potato ? Oh , and his wife 's a friend , I know  --  I know . It 's distressing . And you 're opposed to everything I 'm saying . Trust me , Matthew . Goodness . So am I. But peoplehave their fears ... and Matthew  --  these fears must be put by . Mat was speaking . His collar had chafed his neck . His tongue appeared . The lord kinkle it.  |p178You  can help me , Mat . At the friendly note , Mat 's right eye rose , his hispidulous cheeks bulged with air : puff pop , he spoke . You are  --  I confess it , observe that , I confess it  --  you are essential to me . I have to have you , Mat . My frankness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ohhoo ha  --  perhaps by fear ? Bug beneath the rug . Mat rubs his ear . Tick talk . Do n't mock me , Matthew . That threw him off . His eyes slid . What to make of it . He 'd give anything to get away . Well that 's my price . I 'm two hours late for the Nones myself . Little doth he realize I am the pope 's panjandrum in disguise . His mass is shifting . Watch his feet , oh Furb the foxer , he may be big , but he 's no boxer . Do n't you trust me , Matthew ? It 's not  --  it 's not a matter of trust . Ah , is n't it ? Furber threw up his arms and darted toward the rear of the shop . Darkness seeped from Matthew 's mouth and spilled like smoke on either side of Furber . A dream . An idol breathing steam . He was running blind and struck something . Consequently . Just that , said Furber , dwindling . Fears of Heaven . Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furber returned to the forge and flung his arms over it . Heaven forsaking fears . Oh all right , all right , what else ? Else ? Else ? What do you take me for ? Is n't that enough ? Oh well now nonsense , Jethro . Yes indeed , you 're quite right , certainly , nonsense . Furber snapped his fingers sharply . Nonsense . . . but ? He opened out his hands . He slumped . The pope 's chief panjandrum . A genii . Look at the lion.  |p179I  . . . I . . . shaken to the roots . Towns beginning in C : Columbus , Cleveland , Cincinnati , Chillicothe . . . Come and confess ? What was he daring ? all this god a'mighty amounting ? to my making them up ? Jesus . Look at my coat 's color  --  is it not honest ? Ah . Furber placed his palms against his cheeks . I get no trust . Oh look here , do n't be silly , I do n't distrust you . Under menacing eyebrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech stream burbled . Just the same , you know you tend to . . . well , you 're alwayssort of making mountains , you know , making mysteries out of molehills , always warning and willying the way you do and carrying on .. . Towns beginning  --  towns beginning in  --  god I ca n't think of any . Of course I 'm not against that . I 'm not objecting . Maybe that 's your business and you know your business and you 're doing what you 're supposed to , but . . . well , after all , what are they anyway ? Towns  --  towns . . . Where have I nestled that dagger ? I shall kiss him now and eat him later . Left or right , it does not matter if I contaminate my sacred hand with this pig 's blood . Who has them  --  these fears , I mean ? You have them , is all , Jethro . That 's all . You . You have them . In his face a handful of coals  --  could he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that here , Matthew . No place and time for that now . But we must bruise the serpent , eh ? He peered queerly past his shoulder . There are n't any children about . That accounts for it . That 's strange . Where are they ? They play around here , do n't they ? every day . Mat nodded . The door was forcing itself into his back . Roll hoops ?  |p180On  one foot , Furber began jumping . Hopscotch  --  remember ? Warily , Mat moved in from the door as Furber leaped past . Ever skip rope ? kick the can ? how about hide and seek ? He stopped , noisily huff-puffing his cheeks . He had never uttered an untruth in his life . All his lies had been . . . necessary . Jacks ? He faced toward Watson to demand an answer , but his man was deep in bewilderment now . Mat made a vague gesture , showing his teeth . Phosphorescent , they lit his lower lip . Furber was back on both feet . This seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopping again . Since 0-men-set-ter . . . more-of-them . . . wouldn't-yousay ? he said among bounds . Camel and kangaroo . You could be sewn in the pouch . To take to the air . The day had seemed so clear there 'd been nothing to swim in . Now shadows crisscrossed it like the bodies of divers , and those other bright blue days returned to him , clamoring . He stumbled . Mat leaned forward , saying something Furber could n't understand . My name is Philly Kinsman . I am a famous bandsman . You ladies may have heard of me . I can hold a notejust like a ropethat 's hanging from a balcony . Stooping , Furber dropped an imaginary ball , and with remarkablereality swept his hand down for the jacks . Creep away , sneak away , leak away  --  hide . There are animals hunting in Furber 's inside . You know , Mat , he said , delighted with his performance ,  |p181when  I was a kid I was never permitted to play with other children . The truth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were no hard feelings . But I watched them  --  how I watched them  --  hour after hour : running , jumping , skipping , swinging , dancing , yelling , hopping , singing . . . Did you like playing house ? Never ? School ? No ? Ships and sailors ? I 'm surprised . I certainlywanted to  --  with all my heart . So then I 'd imitate them , go through the motions I saw , pretend I was outside running with them , shouting with them , running and shouting and dancing about like one of them , no differently made . Well . The Olden Days . They should n't occupy us now . Actually , I played caves and craters . And have there been more , would you say , since Omensetter came ? He 's such a hand with kites . Mat struggled with his words . He slapped his thighs . I suppose . Maybe , he said . Good . We are agreed at last . I knew we would . What ? What ? Agreed about what ? Furber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Agreed . My harp is highly rated , and my flute is celebrated , as for my drum , it 's equal fun , however it 's berated .. . Furber moved to Omensetter 's bench and began inspectingit . My lips are highly rated , and my fingers celebrated , as for my tongue , it 's equal fun , however it 's rotated . . . Tannin , he said , makes him seem brown . From oak bark , is n't it ? Gall nuts . Well , an illusion . He 'll be yellowish , by and by . I 've heard it enters poisonously through the fingers.  |p182My  balls are quite inflated , and my ass hole 's lubricated , as for my prick , it 's just as thick , wherever it 's located .. . He shifted a knife . Don'tDisturb . No . Yes , my name is PhilIy Kinsman , and I am that famous bandsman , but silent now my symphony , my fife , my horn , my timpani ; He held up a length of leather. they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flood .. . What I want to know , in strictest confidence , Furber said , is have you seen him strangely any time ? He moved a rule . Have you seen him strangely ? He crossed abruptly to the forge . Catch your death of cold ... day like this , he muttered . Now have you seen him strangely any time ? Oh my god . . . well , honestly , JethroHave you seen him strangely is what I asked : burning piles of tiny twigs and new-pulled grasses , say , or singing to himself in numbers , one two seven four or so , back and forth , six or nine , or crooning , you might call it , to some object  --  rock , a branch , a swatch of cloth  --  or doing things by evens or by odds , walking in a circle or avoiding certain sights , like that of a goose , a cracked glass , or an empty bowl ? gir-affe !  |p183Furber  went on slowly , shyly almost , wagging the meaning of his words away , smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the point of his shoe dug at the floor . You mean that kind of sign , Mat said . My godWell you might invoke Him , Matthew . Sweet christYes . That would be wise . He too . Sweet . I thought by signs you meant just how he knew the baby 'd be a boy . How did he know ? It 's a question that will do . How ? Furber floated to tiptoe , his face alight. cam-el ! kang-a-roo ! I do n't know . I mean  --  how should I know ? He guessed . How should I know ? He wanted a boy bad . You know how that is . Why ask me ? He was lucky , that 's all . Omensetter 's luck . Mat made to move outside but Furber did n't stir . He held his hands above the furnace and the faint light lathered his cheeks . Your answer is n't good enough , his posture said , while his eyes and lips said it was everything , and confirmed his fears . Luck . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street was intimidating. hip-po ! cam-el ! kang-a-roo ! The buildings were of paper . Now against a bench , Mat stood propped . Damn the fat dackering dunce . Again Furber brought his hands , like boards , together. hiiii-eeeee-naaa ! Does he make swirls in his hair with his fingers ? Does he pull at his ear ? Does he turn his head from reflections ? Is he frightened of gnats ?

No  --  I will not listen anymore . . . . And while you hunted , did you swap stories , by any chance ?

Through his back now I can hardly hear the grunting . Not fox . Not likely . Py-thon . Squeeeeeze . Speech ? Eh ? What ? Then Furber feared he might dissolve in giggles . Mat was folding up , his pleats were touching : kiss me on the eyes before they close , good-bye , sweet love , I had my hand at hunt/ing in my time and read the dung of moose  --  pathfinder , man of double-barreled gun . Furber touched Mat 's arm . There , there , he said soothingly , just let me be the judge . Thunder under the mountain . . . owl ox . Hush . Furber put his hands over his ears . He rocked back on his heels . Quick quick quick the sand the softening sand the bursting board the bog of dreams . He knows the future , Matthew , admit that . Fanfaronade . . . goose coot . Hush .

Look  --  if you , Chamlay , or Olus Knox , or I , or anyone like that  --  someone , say , with kids , all girls maybe like Olus has , and like Olus wanting a boy to bear his name onVanity . Well anyway suppose Knox was expecting another  --  His wife 's past that. drill bull gull snipeIt does n't matter , does it ? Just suppose , ca n't you ? Sup-po-sit-ion . . . mule , rail . He 's waiting for the kid to come , thinking this time it must be a boy , it just must be a boy , and then he talks and talks and talks about it , he talks to each of us about it , all the time talking and talking to us , and to himself , too , of course , and he listens to the women going on about those signs the way they do sometimes , and to the men , too , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in colts and calves , and thenp195he starts looking for them because he 's so concerned , like I said , so full of the desire to see them , and because he wants to see them , why  --  he does ; and then he thinks , it 's true , a boy is coming down to me , a boy is coming out of her , and this goes on , you know , like people do go on , and soon he 's just as sure as if he 'd crawled inside like Edna Hoxie said she could and looked . So Edna Hoxie said that . If Knox went on that wayDisagreeable woman . We  --  we would n't think twice about it , I mean if his luck held out and he got the boy he wanted . Laughter carried Furber off , flushing his cheeks and bringingtears to his eyes . He drew a handkerchief from his coat and covered his face .

Be  --  because it 's that fellow O  --  O  --  ah .. . The handkerchief flew back and Furber folded sharply over , shuddering . Because it 's that  --  that fellow  --  oh  --  we do  --  and  --  that 's the hoe  --  whole of it , Matthew  --  you could n't have put it better . Unclasped and straight again , he filled his lungs and dabbed at his eyes . Watson 's body settled slowly . Had n't it moved ? Blinking , he restored the face and its embarrassment  --  or was it bewilderment ? or anger ? or surprise ? Who knew ? A little simple annoyance ? no more ? Mat was drifting toward the back of the shop out of sight . Well I 'm warm now , Furber said , still gasping a bit . If I laughed like that  --  if  --  as often as Omensetter does , whyhoo  --  itwould kill me , like as not . He 's sick , you say ? ... his daw said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who ? ... older .. . Yes .

Do not judge me harshly , Matthew , he said . I work as I can for God . Shivering , Furber presumed a breeze . A large pale smiling moon. gull pelican coot kiteMind , Matthew , he said , turning toward the doorway and Watson 's form looming in it , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . But do n't worry about me .

Such brazen cheek . Standing in rows  --  Furber had difficulty , now , remembering who 'd been the spokesman or even if there 'd been one since like rubber dolls they 'd all squeaked  --  requesting  --  nod-bobbing  --  but not exactly begging , not at all respectful  --  squeezing in his study  --  nerve , nerve , nerve  --  they said , while folding elbow into elbow  --  ah , the brass  --  that they required from him a more moderate tone .

They were Greeks , were they ? these ? this stingy beaked crowd ? Dorcases maybe . More like . Well this is an honor , ladies . Sorry I ca n't ask you to be seated . Quite a pleasure , gentlemen , indeed . The recollection shattered him . He swirled in his room like a storm of snow , striking the wall without feeling . For the Christmas season , for the joyous time , it was their desire that he should put on flesh and a red coat , cry ho ho ho from the pulpit . There would be snow for Christmas and the light sound of bells , and caroleers would gather at the corners of hospitable houses .

The words popped from their rounded cheeks like halfeatenfigs while their small eyes roved up and down searching for something unwashed on his person , their jaws revolving slowly on the sounds of moderation Furber turned to hisses in his own mouth now , and their fat moist palms gesturing at their ears to hear no evil , begging him to protect the young at least for the joyous season , season of their Redeemer , their dear Saviour , their sweet Lord .

Miss Samantha Tottif she were straightened outwould be found to possessbeneath her dressas long a crackas the Erie track ... anyhow , a lover of the Psalms ; and to all those others , with their husbands or their brothers , invisible , behind them , making cautious music for the joyous season , for the season of the Lord 's delivery  --  augh ! I shall be sick , Furber thought , I 'll vomit in a moment , I surely shall  --  or I shall weep . The Reverend Jethro Furber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio crept between the trees and a pale sun softened the snow beneath them . He could , he thought , have preached in Cleveland to a congregationfrom brick houses  --  to beautiful women on wealth and evil . The rich will pay to have their souls revealed . He could have had tea in the great houses ; drunk tea poured from sculptured silver pots to porcelain cups as light as flowers . There would have been cloths of linen and plates of cakes and tiny sandwiches arranged in tiers . He would have sat by the window in a deep chair with laughter and wit like a light around him though he was dressed in his deep gown of disaster . There would be silk falling from full bosoms , silk shimmering in the firelight and reflected in the windowpane , and his eyes would fill with the white arms and bare shouldersof women and his nostrils with the delicate fragrances of their powders and perfumes as they fluttered near him whispering . Thirty boys would compose his choir , each richly arrayed . Stained glass would color all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well-robed acolytes would serve him as he raised the silver chalice to his lips and blessed its scented wine . Stately they would bear before him down the aisle the cross of burnished silver with Christ wrought beautifully upon it at the moment of His cry . Worshiperswhen they entered would display the reverent knee and when he mounted to the pulpit he 'd lift his eyes and see the dust-filled traceries of light just beneath the dome while his hands ran on rich woods like olive , teak , and ebony . At each step the voices of the choir would rise and swell until he turned , left hand lightly on the massive book , right hand high toward heaven , when they would marvelously burst to silence . Intercourse , he could have shouted in that silence  --  adultery . Piss even ? Yes . Piss too . He could have cried piss at the steeple and been applauded during tea . Nevertheless there 'd be no use , no sense to it . That 's what they payed for , the rich in their rich houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so vividly imagined . Titillation . The wealthy ladies would come from church excited and while they slept beside their obese husbands dream of the hard distendedpenis of their coachman hung with jewelry . In the privacy of thought and through the secrecy of image , they would enjoy each sin his preaching had suggested . They would wallow safely in the worst sensations ; conceive the most obscene devices ; place him , their preacher , in vulgar postures ; ravish him on ornate altars or on the floors of pews ; urge upon him the caresses of small boys , naked under choir gowns , still moist and warm from baths . Furber stretched , yawning and rising on his toes . Once these had been his secret fancies too . In former times . In good old bygone days . He remembered rolling on the floor , wrapped in them , in pain , in ecstasy . He 'd fled them here and so his ministry was here , here in the wilderness of conscience ; this sodden dorp and river midden where he preached each week from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shaking a crucifix like a tomahawk , stamping his feet , and in every appropriate way playing missionaryto the forsaken and savage Gileans . Let bygones be . No use . He 'd fled his childhood here , all those flowers and sweet honey , his fears , the evil smell of ink , the shriek of print . . . no use . The wealthy women he was presently imaginingwould love as much exhibiting their naked souls as their naked bodies , and Furber was aware that he himself as often in his dreams found a naked soul to be a naked body that he took them now together in one glance . For terror you looked to the teeth . Rage lay in the muscles of the legs and arms , hypocrisy weighed on the lids of the eyes , while other dishonesties rang around the pupils like shoes thrown true to the stake . The ladies egged him on ; in Eve 's name , they dared him ; so he made love with discreet verbs and light nouns , delicate conjunctions . They begged ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They could not be scandalized  --  impos/sible , they said . Indecent prepositions such as in , on , up , merely made them smile , and the roundest exclamation broke upon them like a bubble 's kiss , a butterfly 's . Smooth and creamy adjectives enabled them to lick their lips upon the crudest story . How charmingly you speak , Reverend Furber , how much you 've seen of this wicked world , and how alive you are to it , they said . And with Mrs. Kinsman he had gottento a point where , by speaking indirectly , he could .. . well . . . say anything . The missionaries , madame , when they reached this remote and isolated place , found the nativesgiven over entirely to the most horrible indecencies , utterlysunk in them . . . They ran about naked for one thing . It was quite a task , let me tell you , to win them for Christ . They practiced the most elaborate ritual competitions which they pretended were also highly magical and religious . A man , to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during the moon 's dark quarter , had to bring a maiden honestlyand safely on through seven tourneys undertaken over seven nights until she felt the seven separate excitements , heights , and swooning conclusions that were considered customary ; these blissful moments to be accomplished on a consecratedcanvas dais under smoking public lights , and the ravishing fulfillments come to in each of the seven now celebratedceremonial ways which the earliest tribal sages , no doubt divinely guided , had somehow hit on and in moving rhymes then movingly indited : that is , by posture , speech , eyes , hands , tongue , feet , and finally uninserted member ; thus leaving her as much a maiden at the end as she had been in the beginning . When you know further , madame , that the virgin in the contest was always the same  --  an angular , man-hating hag  --  alas , completely incorruptible  --  and that she had been performing in the round arena forty years already when the mission beached its boats upon the island , you will understand no ordinary cozy clip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Truly , in that country , the priesthood was a peerless calling , and guaranteed the kingp204should always be advised by the noblest , best , and wisest men the little nation could command . As I 've said , it was quite a task to win them for Christ , but praise the Lord and the strength of the Faith , for it was done . Here 's how : it occurredimmediately to one of the mission , a strapping young cleric named Frederick , that if the Christians could only cone up with a champion of their own , one who had outdoughtiedall others , they should then have a man near the ear of the king who could claim his skill and vigor from his baptism . Conversion would follow hard upon . To achieve this extraordinary end , young Frederick had a plan . This is how he put it into play . . . And then she had offered up that knee , frightfully scarred , and he had gone so far as to touch it . A kiss upon that spot , a healing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bliss  --  such as bliss is . These words of his  --  for her they were only the prelude to Lohengrin , but for him they were the thing , the actual opera , itself . It was just like a woman to want the performance . Yet he was like them , the rich ones not the real ones  --  he , the Reverend  --  with darkness for his dress . In the theater of his head , in the privacy of Philly Furber 's Fancy Foto-Cabinet  --  whatthrilling horrors were enacted , what lascivious scenes encranked . Come to the skull show , honey . Gets no babies out of it , just fun . . . fun thin as tish-ee paper , and all rumply crumply . The difference as it lies these days , professor , between the Christians and the early Greeks ? Christians soap their balls , I think  --  correct , my boy , quite right  --  whereas the pagans , it is my opinion , always olive-oiled their penises . Yes , lad , yes , and the reason for that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we , with wider horizons , steamships , copra , chemistry ... There was a time , I believe , when a Christian did n't dare to wash downstairs for fear he 'd find some pleasure in it . He did n't care to , either , I suspect . His sort was not disposed to water . They drew their substance mostly from the baser , denser , massier elements , and one brief wade and gentlep205sprinkle was enough for them . Go on , go on , that 's shrewd ; though Gibbon said it , still it 's shrewd . Well all danger of pleasure 's past , there 's no risk now . The Christians , too , alwaysimitating Jews , though always poorly I 'm afraid , though they were always Jews , these Christians were , though fallen I fear , have lately cut the ends of their cocks off with consecrated scissors . I should like to put it to the class , sir : what Greek would countenance disfigurement like that , and encourage such a loss of feeling in a fellow ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Socrates  --  with his ambidextrous bat and balls . You 'll go far , Furby . You 've a head , child . All the lines on those amphora would go wrong , sir  --  how they 'd uglify . Amphorae  --  all the lines on those amphorae  --  do n't forget one subject while reciting on another . Besides that , Master Furber , uglify is a barbaric and ugly word . Besides that there 's nothing in Robertson or Hume or Gibbon on this subject , Master Furber , watch your step . The penis in repose , professor , with that little hat of skin , why it 's a lovely childlike thing , and each man 's gentle babyhood is in it . Nor Voltaire , Macaulay , or Carlyle . Please get on . Nor Michelet . But continue . Nor any of the Germans . I remember reading how on one amphora a satyr is depicted balancing , what ?  --  a cup ? bowl ? plate ? one of these , at any rate , upon the point of his prick . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not in Renan , surely ? Are n't you forgetting Tacitus is silent , Cornelius Nepos equally , and Thucydides likewise ? Xenophon notes nothing , nothing . Even Herodotus , or gossips like Plutarch and the Plinys . . . I 'd pay a thousand drachmas to see a trick like that , and sell my soul a thousand times not to feel ashamed attempting it myself . Oh he was like them , like those laced-up ladies  --  warm from words . A man , he still chewed the nipple , titillation , and risked no freer , deeper draught . Fearless in speech , he was cowardly in all else . . . ah , to be rich , luxuriant , episcopal . . . well , he 'd conquered that by flight . Yet to spreadp206simplicity more deeply than cosmetic . . . . These steaming images , Mrs. Kinsman , these strange wants , we must fight them off . You 've been given back to maidenhood . Do not despair . Jerome rejoices  --  he who praised marriage because it made more virgins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The injuryto your husband was a gracious act of God . His first announcement had said that the Reverend Jethro Furber would preach on Godless Ways , a customary theme , and surely disappointing . He thought that considering the circumstances most would think something more pointed was proper , and he knew everyone entertained a picture of Lucy Pimber 's disarranged and dirty clothes . Certainly they would hope that he would preach upon that picture ; define the character of the disaster ; say , in short , what ailed the present time ; warn , as pastors had of old , with a trumpet . Godless ways were numberless , and even though his congregationknew his rhetoric could skirt the nature of each sin so skillfully that selfsame skirt was flung above the head and chaste discretion tumbled , how much easier it was to follow the outline of general woes when colored by your neighbor 's troubles , and how much easier to take to heart the lessons of man 's universal flaws , his little mischiefs , if they were enlivenedwith local examples and the recital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would name a name , but they would have to wait , for it was in the mind of the Reverend Jethro Furber to preach a series , and the thought of its simple form filled him with radiant power . His outward movements were in contrast stiff and short like shafts and pistons that run in rapid jerks from steam . His ends and surfaces trembled continually ; his tongue darted from his mouth and slid its length to disappear ; his dark curly hair seemed tightened into knots and forced flat against his head . Indeed his appearance might have given alarm had he not kept entirely to his study , repulsing every effort to communicate , including those of Jefferson Flack who brought the Reverend Furber 's supper and left it by his lunch.  |p207The  Reverend Furber 's designing figure was a slowly circlinghawk , its orbits tightening until with shut-up wings , it dropped . Only the quietness was out of place . In his plan there was no quietness . Rather he would make them like the windings of hell , noisy with flame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each one a wind of hell , a circle of the hawk , a coil of snake . He paced the room , his body rocking , shouting at God . Always , too , he fought to keep that one bright image out : he standing , she beside . He fought it furiously . He damned the meadow grass that seemed to lie along his cheek all night and the stream that ran like music through him , his voice growing hoarse , lost in his composing , yet always fightingthe cool sweet air , the devilish calm , the loosening that followed him . On his shoulder , sometimes , these sensations seemed . Up his sleeves he found he must pursue them , through his clothing , underarms  --  air like the first of spring , infinitely promising . Then he would shout , writhing , his hands hunting them like crawling things , clawing through his clothes , striking at space , pounding against his ears until he thought the drums would break . All this until he was exhaustedand he fell in pillows , hiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He floated out , alight behind his glowing eyes , the hawk , predatory of mice . He searched eagerly for his texts , reading each one he thought suitable aloud in a voice that shook with emotion . He was silent afterward , listening to himself . Then with angrymutters he always shuffled on . When he finally bent the corner of a page and shut the book , it was suddenly , without a reading or a silence after , like the hawk 's wings come together . He stacked the Bible in the cupboard with several others that despite their excellent condition were deemed by Reverend Furber to have their potency exhausted . They were only fit to serve as prizes for good behavior and dutiful attendance , now , for feats of memory and recital as Miss Samantha , in each case , decided . He was constantly renewing his supply of power . Some demands dispelled it quickly , andp208he 'd seen , in his trouble with the texts , that this one was running down . He had in stock , especially for the series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type and softest leather . He reached in the cabinet and touched the top . There , he thought , was force and eloquence ; he could feel it swelling against the cover . He was troubled , however , by the immanence of his success . He met it everywhere . It was in the air like the smell of apples  --  troubling , sweet . Every day of Henry 's disappearancewas a day of rejoicing , and as the year drifted slowly toward its winter , Jethro Furber sped to his triumph . Yet his visions had increased  --  in vividness , in number , in the shamelessness of their delights . He rolled in pubic hair and woke with semen sliding down his leg . Sin and sin and sin again . He knew the names . But no name damned this clean and innocent relief . It seemed , God help him , like the action of successful prayer , the momentary prevenience of grace . For some time the ferocity of his sermons had increased . He was leading them up . . . up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true despite their disappointment at the general , abstract tenor of his remarks at first , despite their uneasinessat his heat , their mystification , too , since the pitch of his language was steep . So that when the delegates of moderationbroke upon his privacy , they broke his confidence and peace . Could he trust his judgment ? trust his eyes ? for he 'd been certain they were fattening on his words . The sense of his success rose from them like a warm wind from a field , bending the hairs in his nose . Had he only felt his own pulsebeat ? God  --  more moderate  --  a more moderate tone .. . Were they frightened ? then of what ? of the truth  --  was that it ? should that affright them , a simple bugaboo ? well for what cause ? or worse  --  were they merely afraid of what he might say , the embarrassment of it , caught in the pews , with no page to thumb for response ? And events , too , with a kind of fatality , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pimber  --  who could have imagined the extent of his triumph there ? Then summoning all his powers , like an ancient Celtic lord , a Germanchief , an heroic Greek , he had struck down Watson , driving the light from his eyes so that he toppled into darkness and his bones clattered about him . Henry , moreover , had cleverly escaped the combing net . One could only conclude that everything was changing in favor of Furber , everything was moving to the tune of his wishes , everything was changing . . . What was it he heard ? trumpets ? tambourinesand timbrels ? church chimes ? balustrades of bells ? Success , the tide turned once again , that 's what he sensed , and no mistake . Just as he 'd won them in the past by turning out his pockets on the stage , he 'd win them again with a great performance  --  a series of them  --  an extended run  --  triumphtopping triumph . Bright posters posted over town ... bells and banners . . . ding-a-ling , ding-a-ling dong . He 'd give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them ; and turn Omensetter into candle tallow . Well this is an honor , ladies . Quite a pleasure , gentlemen . Can you all fit in ? Why were they whining then ? . . . whining , damn them , whining . . . Because they 'd have to give up their hope of living like an animal and return to an honest , conscious , human life . The prospect was hard.  |p210The  Reverend Jethro Furber rose that Sunday to the pulpit with excitement blazing from him . There was a stirring in the church at late arrivals , and the broken hum and stutter of interrupted whispers filled it . He omitted the customary rites and spoke at once . Our Heavenly Father , we speak within Your Hearing . May we speak with Your Truthful Voice . May we listen to Your Voice in us . May we harken to Your Thunder . He 'd spent a sleepless night . More than once , in complete darkness  --  it was better for the darkness  --  he had parted the curtain and shuffled to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , believing each . There was no way to call back the words as they rushed out , he 'd never remember them , and he was using , in these private sideshows , all his energy : yet before the pale geometry of the windows and in the presence of his own voice , he felt he had been moved to poetry . His flesh had prickled , tears had formed in his eyes , and he thought that at last he 'd opened his heart out honestly . But he 'd opened it to no one , really  --  to an audience of ghosts and churchmice . It was possible , of course , that in some corner , Flack , invisible in such surroundings , nigger like himself , was listening ; and one pretended always that God , too , took an interest ; but in this case  --  God , mice , Negro , weeping preacher  --  they came to nothing . He was exhausted , all nerves , disorganized ; yet he meant , nevertheless , to try to fill their ears with fire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatures up , yet  --  yet he meant to try . Now he examined the space he intended to preach to . It lay just above an irregular terrain of heads and extended to thep211gray crossbeams of the nave with their pale dark ax marks and black spots of iron . Beginning at a point in front of him as far as he could leap , it reached through crisscrossing blades of light to the opposite wall where his melting sight composed the space 's outer edge . He could imagine , looking at it , how chaos was before the first word . It was a striped waste , a visibly starless night . Dust , chambered in rods , lazilysettled in no direction . Indistinctly he could see the tops of those fleshy cabinets which would compartment hell , while above , spanning the peak , were the long bars of heaven and the perching choirs of love . He thought of his voice passinginto it , dust dancing to its tune . There 'd be land in the shape of his syllables , a sea singing , sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , animals with yellow answeringeyes , and finally men taking form from the chant of their names and gathering in crowds to enlarge their reply to the laments which had created them . He did n't dare drop his eyes beyond their hair-capped foreheads . He 'd slide off a nose or suffer a chin slip . Skid more than plummet  --  no posturing could mask it  --  he 'd tip , clump ! into shoes at the end . To find and utter the proper words , the logoi spermatakoi . . . that was Plato 's game , poor John 's jest . Pimber was the word these creatures wanted . Pimm-burr . He had at least one better word than that . The magic words , if he could utter them , would free them from every earthly thing . The steeple-tip of wise Plotinus . Alone like a bird . Farewell . Nevertheless his eyes buzzed in their ears and bit their ankles . One , then two . . . one , two , one two  --  the usual line of shoes  --  a pair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to faces . For god 's sake , Mrs. Spink , be silent . Wait wait wait : screw . Gnawing at his nerves . Do not think of old ties  --  the desert loves the naked . One last look at faces . God . My God . Nose , cheek , chin , hair foresting the brow , ears at the edges , eyes like wells , the wrinkles running off , the raw lips , flakingskin . . . farewell . Christ , what an improbable design.  |p212Screw  them down . " What are you doing in the world , brother , you who are more than the universe ? " Tight . Tight . First  --  sweet gentle John : " he that loveth not knoweth not God . " Then  --  full furious Jerome : " I am prepared to cut a foul-smelling nose . " Tight down . Furber 's right arm sailed . He watched it in surprise . His voice , when it began , was calm and light , smooth and precise . I 've intended for some time to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . None of us wanted this world to begin with . We were orphanedinto it . And we were never fooled . Not fundamentally . We 've always known we had no place . I 'm not speaking simply of our common Christian view . Anyone , however far from us in custom or in country he otherwise may be , so long as he is human , has a soul , and through that soul can sense , the same as we , his strangeness to the life that he 's been sent to . Confidently , Furber strode through the dark . How I wept and shrieked , the saintly Greek , Empedocles , has written , when I was born into this world , my grave . And fallen in flesh , all infants howl . Empedocles believed that his soul , for its sins , must pass from body into body as water passes many sieves ; that it must live through every form of dying and suffer every kind of end . It was his opinion that he had been a boy already , a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mountains , and had spent , in the ocean , the glancing life of a fish . All the elements , he says , were united in rejecting him . The air had chased him to the sea , and the sea had spat him out on the earth 's edge , and the earth had flung him toward the sun . We are here  --  yes  --  yet we do not belong . This , my friends , is the source of all religious feeling . On this truth everything depends . We are here , yet we do not belong ; and though we need comfort and hope and strength to sustain us , anything that draws us nearer to this life and puts us in desireof it is deeply wrong and greatly deceives us.  |p213I  ask you now to ask yourselves one simple foolish question  --  tosay : was I born for this ?  --  and I ask you please toface it honestly and answer yea if you can or nay if you must . For this ? You rise in the morning , you stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , while you snored , the moon burned as it burned for Jesus or for Caesar . You wash , you dress . For this ? At breakfast there are pancakes with dollops of butter and you drip syrup on your vest . So it 's for this . You lick your lips . Ah , then it 's this . You slide your pants to your knees and you grunt in the jakes . It 's for this ? Light 's leaving a star while you stare at the weeds ; centipedeslive in the cracks of the floor ; and the sun , the Lord says , shines on good and evil equally . So you were meant for this ? You 've your eyes , your human consciousness , for this ? Well you 're not entirely easy in your mind . The weather 's been poor . There are the crops to get in , payments to make on the farm , ailing calves to tend . Friends have promised to help with the haying , but they have n't , and you 've got to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a bitch with cow 's teats . The mind 's for this ? Wipe yourself now . Hang your pants from your shoulders . There are glaciers growing . But you wish your wife were n't so fat and given to malice , and your thoughts are angry and troubled by this . This ?  |p214Very  well  --  you can complain that I 've chosen trivialities in order to embarrass you . Eat , sleep , love , dress  --  of course you were born for something better than this . Furber 's eyes drew slowly to a smile . The church sprang into being , unrelated colors first , sparks of light , the world seen from a mountain ; then delineations , corridors , retreats .. . solidities and meanings . Marvels , they were , all of them , a moment , before they became what they were . He had got off on the wrong foot . Wrong foot  --  feet made him laugh . His laughter , which was loud and gay , he closed by coughing . Our life is one long stream of piss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shaking , he sank on his heels . How long had he been a-tiptoe ? Fine beginning . Empedocles indeed . Had he said or had he only thought the name ? In Gilean . Empedocles . As strange as Jesus . Perhaps he should have them stand and sing , then after the singing start all over . He smiled , showing his palms , but he was stuttering and could not utter a number . He drew his hands behind him where they flew at one another . I 'm not a man of many convictions .. . No no no jesus . There were people leaving . But he kited his eyes . In the balconies  --  choirs . How many ? who ? one , two . . . He felt the richness of his robes and the weight of his responsibilities . Light rained through the windows .

There was the faint smell of print and paper . The pages felt cool to his cheek . He cuddled his head in his arms . It would be good to remain here and sleep . But in a moment he would have to straighten and face them . He could n't very well confess then that he had no convictions himself and cared nothing for what they believed , for how they adored confessions . Go home , go home , I have nothing to tell you .

Then bend to your homes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charming , light through lemon leaves , honorable and distinguished wounds . Ah well now , Mrs. Spink , so you 've chewed up your sour little hymn . Furber tugged at his shirt sleeves and pressed his coat smooth . Let me  --  like children  --  as though you were children  --  let me tell you about it again . Now then  --  thank you , thank you all , yes , thank you  --  as you will remember , in the beginning , you remember , God  --  God  --  What had God done ? God had labored five days when He created man . God had sent His presence through the darkness which was lying softly on the surface of the water fast asleep , there to take part , cleaving night from night to make day . Then God had sent His presence down into the middle of the sea , when the sea was asleep , separating the sweet half and lifting it like a canopy above the rest . And then again He 'd sent Himself to the sea to gather it , and He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net , so that land appeared where the water had been carried away . Thus He labored till the third day . It would be wise to remember what it was of living things God made on the third day , for He favored the fruits first . He made all seeds  --  seeds of tender grass and trees of gracious shade . Then He made the moving sun , the alternating moon and brilliant stars , and He appointed some to regulate the night , and others to design and rule the day . Finally , on the fifth , God fastened life in the water and at the water 's edge and in the air  --  whales and seals and salamanders , darting birds . Then as the sea had formed fish after its own , and the air had fashioned even eagles and wild gulls on the model of the wind , so the earth was let to bring forth animals in the living likeness of itself  --  cattle and snakes and bears , each and every kind.  |p217As  you remember . . . you surely remember .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days had passed beneath the earth forever , and when God saw what He had made was good , only then did He consider creating man , who was to have , as the sun had in the brilliant heavens , and as the moon had among the stars , dominion over life . So He prepared . He formed dust about His own breath like a chrysalis . He prepared  --  blowing in His fist , making man a hollow vessel and shaping earth about His breath with His own hands . He prepared  --  pouring His breath like a preciousliquid through the nostrils of the human jar . Consequentlyman had a likeness in him that was great and holy from the first , sacred and terrible . Just as God in the begin-'ling had divided the darkness to make light , stealing on it while it lay asleep , and just as God had taken the sweetness from the sea as it rested to vault the sky , so mankind was also divided in slumber , and the darkness taken , and a portion of the divine breath too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these divided halves should come together , part and come together , so that what had once been mixed might mix again , so that what had once beensundered might be sundered again , just as God had donethese things during the six days of His labor . Everlastinglynow , the sea yields up its heaven . What was earth , soonenough again , is earth . Men and women mingle , and arelonely after . Yet there was already enmity between the dark and thedarkness , between salt and fresh , the sea and its fishes , the air and its eagles , the unmoving earth and its teeming kinds , man and his woman ; for night had lost half of itself to day , as the sea had to the heavens , and the earth to its millions . Man could not endure alone , without a likeness of himself , and some say , though I believe they are mistaken , that Adam beseechedGod for his mate . Yet when Eve was lifted from his side and the skin tied at the navel , he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and felt envy ,  |p218since  beside him now lay man perfected , his poorest part ennobled , glorified . I defy you to find where in Holy Writ it says he was satisfied . Adam wished the return of his softer half . He wished to be whole again as he was in the beginning . Alas . The earth also wished him back . The sea wished to swallow the land again , and deep night groaned against the light . Such is the lesson  --  listen carefully to it  --  of this remarkablecreation . Now there was in heaven , as you know , an angel , prince among them , the Prince of Darkness . And he felt his wife drawn painfully from him , out of his holy body , fully half of himself , and given a place of dazzling splendor . How he hated it , and suffered his loss loudly . Then at the end of the sixth day , after God had created man and driven his beauty from him like a specter ; when at the end of the sixth day man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been driven from sleeping night and the sky looped over the slumberous sea and life drawn from the noddingearth , God ordered the whole Host of Heaven to kneel to this wondrous pair , so to signify their admiration of them . But the Prince of Darkness said , lamenting : my Lord , You made the sun and moon to rule the halves of my former kingdom , and You grew plants to supervise the earth , and then You gave the animals these . Now finally You have made this frail potter 's figure , man , to multiply and feed and fatten on the beasts . But God ordered the whole Host of Heaven to kneel to the images of Himself He had created , so to signify their admirationof them . But the Prince of Darkness , grieving , said : my Lord , You did not mean the moon to play havoc with the daytime , or the sun to rise for the pale canary or set for the remorseless cat . Therefore it is not fitting that we , immortal lordships ,  |p219should  play the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominion over us . But God ordered the whole Host of Heaven to kneel , nevertheless , and to indicate thereby their admiration for the Lord , Himself , who had created man , this marvel among even the marvelous . But the proud Prince of Darkness refused . It was at the close of the sixth day then that Satan , for disobedience and a broken heart , was dismissed with his companions from the loyal Host of Heaven , and like a burningstreak of vapor fell by the sun 's face into his element . Hush . . . hush . . . What 's next ? Like a waterstrider , Furber rode a thin film of sense . Later God made Eden with its rivers and put Adam and Eve to paradise there , though some say He made Eden earlier , before Eve , as it appears in the Bible . The tree of life grew in the garden , and also the tree of the knowledge of good and evil . It was this latter tree of which God forbade Adam and Eve to eat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know to our sorrow . The finer half fell first  --  the last and best of all creation  --  so now she brings forth her children in pain and labor , and serves the poorer portion as her punishment . God created always by division , taking the lesser part , transforming it into its opposite , and raising it above the rest . So should we change our worst into our best . Furber snapped his fingers . There was a good one . That was the kind of thing they liked . Should he say it again ? But he was losing the thread . There is everywhere in nature a partiality for the earlier condition , and an instinctive urge to return to it . To succumb to this urge is to succumb to the wish of the Prince of Darkness , whose aim is to defeat , if possible , the purposes of God 's creation . We do on occasion forget , of course , the clay we 're made of . We do sometimes deny our animal nature and our origin in the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Prometheus , both painful and lonely , and we do not pursue it long . For the most part men look upon their humanity as a burden , and call the knowledge of what they are a simple consequence of sin . Men , like all things , resist their essence , and seek the sweet oblivion of the animal  --  a rest from themselves that 's but an easy counterfeit of death . . . Yet when Adam disobeyed , he lit this sun in our heads . Now , like the slowest worm , we sense ; but like the mightiest god , we know . Lovely lights and swooping swallows , carpeting the distance . . . So we do not belong . We 're here . Like the hunchback is here in his hump , the crow in his caw . Oh god , we 're here . Yet we do not belong . The eye of the animal opens . Think . He sees . What a strange thing seeing is to exist in this world . His eye opens  --  the ferret 's eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in that moment and for the first time . . . images . . . Imagine we open the eye of a man . Thought lies on the other side of that thin lid . He sees without blinking . Blind , he still sees  --  the pitiful creature . Of course . He 's the wondrous watchman , is n't he ? Watching . . . watching like a weasel in the weedsWhat 's skittering ? It 's this sun in my head . They are naked and exposed , I said . N-n-nay-kidd . Where  --  let 's see  --  yes . Who is honest in the dark ? Prometheus ? Empedocles ? Holy Jesus . He bent his head and saw print running down the pages . Text . He had a text . Who was still here ? Space . Embroidered with light . The print was flowing . Text . He had a text . Text to keep talking . Inward  --  in a word  --  inwardly  --  in his innards  --  large guards , were they ?  --  sourly  --  shards of heart  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in terror of spirit  --  to fall so inwardly . . .  | " And the voice said , Cry . And he said , What shall I cry ? All flesh is grass , and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field : " The grass withereth , the flower fadeth : but the word of our God shall stand for ever . " . .. but fall down inwardly .. . You then , the scripture says , are the people . You are the grass . You are the flesh , the grass . Do you imagine that the grass , by growing , can become the cow ? Was there snickering ? . . . was there tittering ? snickering ? Who was out there ? Embroidered space . This lifeThis life passes like a day in fertile country all too soon . Touch the book . Touch the book . His fingers skidded on the pages . Pews were tipping empty . We 've slid to hell ! the boards have broken ! Are those the dancing ladies ? Behold him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may perceive the concourse of the anus . And the fiend . . . He will appear with apple-rosy cheeks and friendly tousled hair . . . with candid eyes and openendedspeech . Lead us out of this place , oh Lord , that we may have reason to praise your mercy . Those who remain .. . Let us pray.  |p222It  began to snow as Chamlay and Furber reached the house . The flakes fell slowly out of a close sky , clinging to the tips of the high grass and breaking gently on their faces . It was the middle of the morning but the hushing snow and gray light gave to everything a quality of evening . A daughter let them in . Each hesitated to precede so they squeezed through awkwardly , bumping together . Amos was at the breast and the room was full of the sounds of his feeding . He 's out with Arthur , she said , attending to her son , her face expressionless , her voice as cold and aimless as the snow . Furber 's gaze fled over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He saw beyond that the cracked and splintered fir board floor , the wood grain nearly gone under a grime of years that turned the whole floor gray . Chamlay stared brazenly about . Motionlessand tense , the brown-eyed daughters , their faces pale and drawn , sat leaning forward in ladder chairs set close together against the wall , touching the lower rungs with feet as tentative as birds ' , and holding hands . A patched and faded yellow comfort draped over a cradle in the corner . Above hung a landscape containing a river . A table whose top was heavily scarred and carved stood unevenly by the front window , a long bench beside it . Furber took out his watch and looked at the photograph fastened to its lid  --  a picture of himself and two distant cousins , girls of ten , whose names he 'd long ago forgotten . Furber appeared strangely white and plump beside them , and held a smile to his mouthp223which he had always found beguiling . Now he inspected his cousins again . Only then did the dresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and short on them , too frequently and too furiously washed . Furber sighed and snapped the watch shut . He 'd never been a plump one . There was a white ironstone teapot on the table with a wooden spoon beside it and a trail of crumbs . The girls gazed at something out the window but gave no sign they saw . They seemed about to issue into flight . A dented and badly tarnished copper pan sat on the hearth . It was likely English , he thought , and of considerable age . From time to time wood settled , sending sparks up the chimney . At last he turned from the dark stones and put his watch away , smiling at the girls . Another picture hung from string and nearing it he made out St. Francis feeding squirrels . Very nice , Chamlay was saying circling briskly , very nice indeed . On the way they 'd scarcely spoken . Chamlay had wanted Olus Knox to accompany him , but Olus showed no heart for it , and Furber , happening by chance to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rage . He now suggested that the moment was n't right ; that he 'd return another time ; but silencereceived him , and as they shifted in the room they failed to draw an eye . Then Chamlay began to question her in a voice that was soft and deferential . Furber moved in front of the girls , smiling still , about to speak , while their mother rocked on cautiously . The girls ' lips were pale and parted slightly over clenched teeth . Furber faltered , then went around them and behind their mother to peer into the hall . Chamlay put his questions again . She did n't know where he 'd gone , she said . She did n't know when he would return . Chamlay and Furber drifted protectively together , holding to the brims of their hats . She changed breasts withoutconcern , slowly covering the emptied one , which was surfaced with gooseflesh like a lake in a shower . The older girl , Furber noticed , had an elbow chafed.  |p224You  may stay if you like . I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 'll get chairs . Chamlay 's gesture of regret went unobserved . You do n't know why , he said . She blew on the baby 's hair and rubbed his scalp with a moistened finger , settling herself a little , twitching her shoulders . The infant 's red cheeks worked . Furber touched Chamlay'ssleeve and motioned to the door . She carefully kneaded her breast . He feels he 's got to find Henry . They moved uncertainly as she looked up . Chairs , she said . The girls rose , but both men put out their arms . No , they said . The girls ' hands were clasped , their gazes steady , their mouths exactly carved . Furber chewed his cheek . The baby loudly smacked his lips and the nipple escaped , standing out long and wet . Why try , she said , what difference will it make ? what good ? Amos fought to find the nipple , puffing , about to cry . Chamlay 's face was brightly flushed . He held his hand demurely across his badge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for one thing , Chamlay said . The nipple skidded over the baby 's cheek . It caught in the corner of his mouth and then sank in , leaving a trail of milk . Mother , the older daughter whispered , startling the men . He means Missus Pimber , her mother said . Well , there 's that then , Chamlay said . Dead , she said , what good ? She rocked more rapidly . What 's any body good for , emptied out ?  |p225The  law , you understand , has an interest , said Chamlay firmly . Less use than a barrel , its bottom stove in , she said . Chamlay shook his head . You misunderstand . There may have been some violation in his death . He paused . Absence , I should have said  --  disappearance . He ca n't be punished now for that , she said , he 's dead . How is it you 're so sure , Chamlay said urgently , and her head snapped . Do n't play the fool . Chamlay cleared his throat while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knob . The daughters , standing yet , fixed Chamlay and their mother with an intense blank stare like the stare of plaster statuary . We do n't want to get caught in this snow , Furber said . It was the well , I think , she said in a moment , returning her attention to her son . It was that simple circle in the ground . He sure acted queer about it . Furber came forward and tugged at Chamlay 's shoulder . We never did him any harm I know of , and when he had the lockjaw , he lived for Brackett 's sake , it seemed to me . She thought a bit . Then  --  she shrugged he killed himself . She stopped rocking and looked over her shoulder down the hall . I thought I heard Arthur but it must have been another dog . . . He killed himself . It 's hard to believe . What harm had we done him ? Living in this house ? Do you know ? The baby belched and she patted his back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's been out there at it and what harm had we done him ? And to die as he must have ,  |p226do  n't you think ? in the leaves and all that wind , cold and away from every friend and everything he loved . How could he do it ? . . . Are you the sheriff ? I did n't know we had one . . . Arthur 's bark is harsher . . . And what harm ? to anyone ? I ca n't believe it . It runs right over , it runs right over me . I ca n't stand crawling things , can you ? Well it just comes over me like that . Terrible . She shivered . You want to wash things like that out of your clothes , off your body  --  rub them away . . . It turns you cold . . . Well , it 's terrible to live , for some , I guess . She let some spit to her finger and began carefully scrubbingbehind the baby 's ear . How does it feel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suck a soft teat ? She looked up at Chamlay . He has a powerful draw . She blew gently on the baby 's head . Well we 've all forgotten , I guess ... big as we 've got ... old . Amos  --  he just wants to sleep and eat . Henry 's in the woods somewhere , somewhere in a field , or rump up underwater , maybe , someplace . Amos  --  the mister says we 'll call you Amos . Why , do you suppose ? She laughed . Mother , the older daughter said , mother , please . She slowly subsided . You little muffin , she said , nuzzling him . Then her face was smooth and worn and white again . The fox died better , she said . I 've seen a spoiling mouse that still had dignity  --  but men . . . That fox now , Chamlay said . It was funny about that fox . Strange , I mean . You were going to let him starve down there , I hear . Why ? What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , Curtis , Furber said , she does n't know anything.  |p227After  a while , you know , it might have begun to whine and whimper . You 're thinking of a dog , she said . A fox dies quiet . Well what was so funny about it ? That gets me . What was so funny ? And now you shrug . Well it 's easy for you to shrug , I suppose  --  what with Omensetter 's luck . Oh we 've never had much luck . Chamlay cackled brutally . How do you think Lucy Pimber feels  --  her husband gone , lost , no one knows where  --  sitting at home while we walk through the woods looking for him  --  and in places where no living man should be ? She smiled . When I was twelve I had a rabbit for a whole day . Mother . Is he worth all this fuss and march about ? For heaven 's sake , he 's a human being . He 's got more feelingthan a fox . You ought to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was still alive ? Chamlay swore and turned away . The baby 's head fell from its breast , curd on its lips , eyes closed . Open the door for these men , she said . Chamlay and Furber filed out , immediately putting their hats on their heads and drawing deep shuddering breaths . The door shut behind them with Amos coughing . The air had a nip now though the snow had ceased and flakes were melting on the ground . The sky seemed , if possible , even nearer . Through the bare trees they could see the calm Ohio . Chamlay stood some moments in the yard , Furber quietly beside him until he took to shivering . Then they rode off . Now and then a crisp breeze felt its way through the woods from the river . They left the path and had gone a little on the road when Chamlay sighed . His face had cooled and the determination of his body eased . He spokep228out of deep thought , as though alone . Did you ever see , he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . No , Furber finally answered when he thought he understood , I never did ; though he lied , since he knew one other time he had.  |p229When  Omensetter shook the door with pounding , the ReverendFurber shouted no , and drove his fists together . It was six in the evening , he was in his nightshirt yet , his voice was hoarse , and his eyes were badly puffed . All day he 'd thrashed about and wept and yelled at Pike . Now he sat in the dark , mooning dimly , cursing his tears and knotting his bedclothes . The room was cold . The coals in the grate had thick covers of ash , and moisture had frozen on the windows . He 'd risen early , in the grip of a dream , and stumbled to the vestry where Flack had begun his sweeping . You 've been telling people things about me , he 'd said bluntly . The colored man had clung to his broom while Furber cruelly accused him . You know all about me . You 've given me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself in a basin . Of course it was an act , another futile gesture , and he 'd flung the basin the length of the hall  --  carrying it carefully from his room first , so as not to wet his belongings . Back on his bed he hammeredthe wall , wailing and weeping . It was true that the day had passed quite quickly , yet he did n't think he 'd snoozed . He 'd been in a genuine delirium , then , and he took some comfort from the momentousness of that conclusion . But he was hardly prepared for the pounding which suddenlyassailed him  --  pounding not his own  --  from without , not within  --  repeated , thunderous , imperative . The lummox is here , he thought , and he drove his fists at one another so viciously his knuckles skinned . I must see you , Omensetter said . Furber almost laughed . There 's no light , no fire . I 'm sitting in the dark.  |p230He  need n't have answered . Omensetter had no way of knowing he was there  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately ashamed . Flack came by his color honestly . The little Negro would never have betrayed him . It was inconceivable . He had cared for the church when Rush was its master , and he had suffered without complaint through its terrible plague-time under Furber the Furious , Jethro the Pretender , always serving loyally and with equal love , Furber felt certain , though each day , lately , he had seemed to shrink a little , and to go about his work still more invisibly . During all this time , Furber had actually learned nothing about him ; he had never taken the slightest trouble for him or shown the least real interest . The fellow had remained a servant , a Negro , a mystery . And why should n't he be a mystery ? No one is simple , he was about to say , yet how would he know ? What had the watchman seen on his rounds ? Surfaces . Scatters . He 'd kept everything at a word 's length , and it was words he saw when he saw her  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words he felt when his anger burned him , when he shook and wailed and struck about wildly . Out of the world he could safely take just the ravelings : the color of the bruise on his toe , for instance , or the isolated croak of a frog which surprises the afternoon , or the vision of an intense green slope where a ball coasts under a wicket . Though mankind was his hobby  --  so he 'd often said  --  he knew nothing of men . Negro seemed more properly the name of a patent medicine , just as mankind , despite his study , was only a compound joke to him . Furber ached , for a change , from the blow he had struck the friend of his church , but there was no help for it now , and he would not bandage either wound by begging for forgiveness . In one way Gilean was more punished than Egypt , he thought , since Egypt was never visited by a plague of lies . I have to see you , Omensetter said . What can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the bed . I 'm not all dressed , he said.  |p231He  was worn out , defeated . His head buzzed . His feelings were shredded , and he was shaking badly  --  out and in . He knew he must look a sight . The last few days he had grown increasingly careless . He had refused to shave . He had howled for Pike and got no answer . Incredulous , he had walked around his clock in the garden . Sunday would come soon . There 'd be no sermon . He watched the snow whistle through the gate and sink in the Ohio . Since he was done for in Gilean  --  done for everywhere in that case  --  Furber wondered why Omensetter could not leave him alone . What do you want ? I want to speak to you , but I ca n't shout through this door . It 's late . I know it 's late . There 's time enough , though . It 's important . I have n't had my dinner . Omensetter rattled the knob . All his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He thrust a paper spill through the ashes and the room rolled in its flare . After these sounds , would the door come down ? The bolt rattled at Omensetter 's urging and Furber 's hand shook . Wrinkles appeared in the wallpaper ; the walls themselves seemed to waver ; corners of the room crumpled ; the ceiling swooped ; there were bats on his pillow . It took a certain sort to undertake such banging  --  just the sort of loud muscling oaf he was . If he let him in . . . then there he 'd be , filling the door , huge , breathing heavily , the edges of his fists red , lips wet , body rocking , every bit as real as  --  as what ? the bats on his pillow ? the chasm yawning by his bed ? the hungry holes in the wall ? As the lamp lit , the room grew ; its objects steadied . Furber dropped a smoking fragment of paper . He gently mooed and blew upon his fingers . The comedyis finished . The floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coming . . . Hoo . Relief and fright at silence . To mortify the flesh , Furber heeled the ash , then sought his slippers . There was nop232harm done . He needed a nightcap to go with his nightgown . Then he thought he knew how he felt  --  like someone facing execution . Coming . . It was true . He was too exhausted to contain any greater emotion . A night 's grief , a night 's waiting , and now the wardenwith his keys . Furber 's head ached . Yes , his eyes were surely swollen . Pale , the prisoner from his cot . . . The gray wet wall of the garden . . . forlorn ivy . . . dripping trees . . . Then scorn for the hankie blinding . Lift fist forward  --  defiant to the last . Cry death to truth and long live liars . Bangedy bang . You were in bed . Omensetter gave him a sheepish grin and slapped snow from his shoulders . That 's what I said . Then it 's good I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His face was pale from exhaustion and filthy from the woods . Furred with a week 's beard , it was deeply creased and there were lines of windburn across the cheeks . His clothing was badly picked and burred , pulled out and twisted on him , and he struck at his body repeatedly with his hands . Furber retreated to a chair . I 've found him , Omensetter said . Have a seat , said Furber weakly . Omensetter advanced , buffeting his ears . I 've found him . You'veRight . Boy . Yes I have . Ever seen weather so bad so early ? Henry ? Right . Whew . I have n't been in  --  I have n't been in to work much  --  what with hunting him . He 's dead ? Sure . The nightshirt rose a moment  --  sat . Now , with God 's help ,  |p233Furber  would look at him , flat on , for he was all new ; his face no longer suited him , nor did his hands . His nose was inappropriate , his words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whapping and bashing . . . new . And Furber began to feel his bones gradually burning with shame . I see , he said . Ha ha . Yeah . Omensetter pulled off his hat . For christ 's sake , did he chew , Furber wondered . In a moment he would snap his suspenders . Omensetter turned very slowly around in the room . Then he .. . In the woods . There was a little red in the stubble of his beard , Furber noticed . He was wiping his mouth with a wool rag of hat . You did n't bring him in ?  --  bring him back ? At this moment , Furber thought , Henry might be propped like a statue in the vestry  --  the new-found saint and spirit of the woods . Boy , you should see . Omensetter looked dramatically at the ceiling . I mean  --  holey oley  --  he 's up high . In a tree . Way up there  --  a terrible climb . Heavier in his chair , Furber tried to keep his head clear . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be gone through , but he could squeeze out only a little , it was too grim : the glints from Knox 's glasses afflicted him , there were long sloping woodrows , smoked with frost , furry mittens ice had beaded , shouted curses and intemperate commands , squeaking tree boughs , looping veils of snow ; yet even these paltry tatters were shameful  --  Hawkins whittling a wooden penis  --  for he was burning ; his ears and cheeks were aflame from the past , since Omensetter seemed so different than he was , or otherwise than he had been , as he was altogether slow and sad and shy now , or embarrassed  --  rueful ? wor/ried ? scared ? god knew . " His watchmen are blind : they are all ignorant , they are all dumb dogs . " You mean he 's still there , Furber said finally . Sure . That 's where he wanted . BesidesBut how in heavenHe hung himself . But  --  the question crept through Furber 's fingers  --  why did he have to do it in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yeah . Why ? Boy . Omensetter began roaming around the room . Aunt Janet had teetered , soul in her eyes  --  he could read . Through this damn back and woody shoulders  --  nothing ... christ . " The invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen . " Another lie . How long has Henry  --  been up there ? Furber asked in a proper mourner 's voice . Omensetter hesitated . I could n't say . Some time . I 'm not a real good judge . He fiddled with the lamp , reducing the light . Who have you told ? Nobody  --  not even Lucy . She 's still at the Hatstat 's . I mean I have n't been home . I came straight here . Straight , straight , straight . The crooked , straight . He had to scratch his foot . You would n't think anything so cold could itch , he said , apologizing , but Omensetter was n't really aware of him . Besidethe little table , rubbing the edge , he waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and let Henry hang there  --  that would be easiest . So you want me to break the news ? Furber sighed , restoring the slipper , and thought suddenly of Persepolis and rows of granite lions . It 's my business , I guess , he said . I had n't thought about that.  |p235You  had n't ? Then in christ 's name why did you pick on me ? Not because I 'm a preacher . Am I so close ? convenient ? friendly ? Look  --  I 'm not the by-your-side sort , you know that . For you , I 'm neither person nor parson . . . Well was nobody home in the whole town so you were left with me ? Too bad . I 'm not home either . I 've just gone out . The man you 're talking to is Furber 's ghost . And I 'm not going to crawl up a tree to bump him down either , if that 's what you expect  --  I 'm not all that handy . Look parson , do n't you believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . HonestlyFurber groaned with annoyance . He 's hanging from a limb . From a limb like a leaf , I 'm sure , Furber said , jumping up . That 's poetry  --  sweet immortal poetry  --  it really is . The symbolicclown . Omensetter rushed to the door . Calm and threatening by turns now , he was like a piece of weather in the room . The curtains seemed to lift a little as he passed . Sorry , Furber said , promptly sitting . I keep forgetting you 're a hero . Have a seat . Furber carefully measured the air into fish lengths . Gilean searched , but Omensetter found , he said . Am I cor-rect ? I know I was wrong , Omensetter said , his hand on the knob , but I had n't figured . . . well I was mistaken , I was wrong . . . Lucy said you would n't favorFavor ? favor what ? Omensetter drifted from the door . Me . You ? Yes . You have n't been home . No . But you discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What I should do . Then Jethro Furber wondered whether Omensetter was n't an actor . What do you keep in that ? What ? That . This ? Yes . Bibles , Furber said , still disconcerted  --  holy things . A pretty picture . My god , he 's maneuvering , Furber thought . We 've one of St. Francis feeding squirrels . I know . Lucy said that you 'd been out . With the sheriff . Chamlay 's no sheriff . He has a badge . Badge . That 's a story . He has some authority . Furber let it pass . The gosh-boy business was gone . Omensetterwas speaking calmly now , but with almost desperateintensity . And he was absolutely still . It was uncanny . Well he 's way in the woods and high in the air . No wonderthey never saw him . Nobody 'd think to look straight up . You did . No I did n't . It was luck . I just happened to . I got a crick in my neck and was working it out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll his head about wildly . And now his soul 's where it serves him . I ca n't do anything . Furber was knitting his fingers . The whole thing was absurd . He trapped his tongue behind his teeth . Omensetter does n't notice my puffy eyes . He does n't notice anything . Long live the pretty speech . Have a seat . Omensetter riffled a book . You have n't seen how high he 's hung himself . He picked ap237white oak . It 's huge  --  a hard climb in the cold . I 'd like to borrow this . I read sometimes , though not in the winter . The light is n't well for the eyes . Furber made a low sound of disgust . He 's wearing that gray wool coat with the wide pockets he used to stuff duck shells in . He has his hands down them now , and he 's hanging by the belt so his head tilts to the side some when he spins . Does he seem well rested ? I could n't tell . Oh come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns , you said . He turns some . You do n't intend to leave him up there ? Ha ha . Boy . Have you got any books on birds ? You do , then . Sure . But they wo n't leave him hanging when I 've told them where he is and everything . I was a friend of Henry 's , so  --  you know  --  in a way I wish they would . He 's up there , Mister Furber . Boy . I had a notion not to say a word and leave him be , but I guess I ca n't . My feet are cold , Furber said firmly . We need a fire inhere . I 'm cold all over . Somewhere there 's a little scuttle  --  They 'll never find him without a dog , he 's hung so high . Sometimes it gets slid under this stool . With the wind taking every scent , it took my Arthur time out of mind , plus my wise crick in the neck besides , although Arthur 's got the finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the corner there . Maybe they 'd have a little luck like mine with the Bencher hound . I do n't know . Or kicked under the bed . I 've got a terrible bruise on my toe . It 's bad weather for it , the wind 's in your eyes all the time.  |p238You  know  --  a fit of pique . I notice they 've been slow to go to dogs  --  that Chamlay fellow does n't like them . I just do n't know . Hog Bellman . They remind him , that 's why . Say , I want to show you that toe . The nail 's black . Anyway , they 'll never think to look so high . He 's hung way up . River or field or floor of the woods is all in the world they 'll think of . Ah , here it is  --  would you think of that  --  back of this stack of books . I 'd just as soon keep shut . Let me just poke this up a bit . You read all them books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belt will rot or the limb he 's hanging from will break . I thought as much . I 'm surprised he found a branch as high as that to hold him so far out  --  enough to be above another tree , a little hackberry it is , covered with those witches ' brooms . Henry must have had a real desire to die there . I climb easy and that climb near finished me . It 's smoking some . Too bad I 've no kindling . Must n't put on too much . Maybe he farted and flew up . Furber felt sorry for him . The forceful ends of Omensetter'sfingers had left red lines on his face . The corners of his mouth twitched ; he blinked ; he examined his coat sleeve . Furber had cranked his head around . Now it turned back to the fire . He could n't have done any better if he 'd hit him with the poker . When I first saw Henry I thought he was a great horned owl . Damn this Pennsylvania coal . Furber was squatting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch his shoulder.  |p239One  day certain , if I leave him there , that bough or that belt will break and he 'll come down through the hackberry , branch by branch , and be mostly in bones at the bottom . Who 'll know then , for sure , he hung himself up there  --  beyondanybody else 's doing ? In front of Furber : a landscape of coal and ash and faint smoke . You do n't touch the minister . His nose needed blowing . What a godforsaken thing this was . And you 've chosen to tell me . Yes , Omensetter said , I know I have your trust . The imbecility of this remark was so immense that Furber found it impossible to respond to it . He shook his head and rose . The new coals would not ignite . He held the poker . Maybe he should . Tell me  --  what 's your idea ? Why did Henry turn so strange ? He hung himself a way that suited him . Oh stop it . I could n't safely come to anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a man of God . Omensetter looked at him strangely . Where have you been , Furber said , now out of control . You 're in the wrong farce . You have to believe me . You know the trouble I 'm in . I could n't safely come to anyone but you . Finding Henry where I did was great luck , but Knox , you know , and Hatstat , and ChamlayYes indeed , Knox , the Hatstats , and Chamlay , said Furber furiously , you 're right ; and Hawkins , Orcutt , Stitt , and Fyle  --  not out of jealousy , if you 're thinking that  --  Tott even , Lemon Hank , my Flack and Edna Hoxie , all the wives and Splendid Turner , Cate and Bencher , Alfred Candle , that fool Jess Ivry , oh and Mossteller , the dutchman Blenker , Amsterdam , that Scanlon woman , Mat Watson tooNot Mat.  |p240Not  Mat ? Oh , you  --  you fool . Please . Please ? You ask a please of me ? Furber whistled his wind out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spoke very slowly and carefully . But Mat especially , he said . He especially will think you throttled Pimber and hauled him up . My guarantee . Oh yes  --  Lucy Pimber too  --  no trouble there  --  everybody  --  your own wife , maybeNo , not Mat . Of course , Mat . Furber chuckled bitterly and slapped his left hand smartly on his cheek . Why not Mat ? Mat first of all . Where  --  have  --  you  --  been ? A friend , eh ? Hooey . A friend . Friends all . Hatstat too . Chamlay . There 's a friend . All the ladies . All the friendly women . Kindly Knox . Tott , who loves stories . The dear dear Doctor . Stitt and Hawkins . There 's a pair . Everybody . LovableLucy . Have you had her ? She 's eager . And Jethro Furber , that sweethearted cuss . Everybody . He dropped the poker with a clatter and formed two eloquentfists . Go away . Go away , you idiot . What are you making me say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to pace between the table and the wall . Come safely , he said . The fool . Come safely to me ? The idiot . I 'm safety ? Where  --  where have you been ? My god . My god . A friend . I 've spent my life spreading lies about you . A friend , eh ? a friend , a friendOkay . It 's okay . You  --  you know nothing of the life you live in . Sweet christ , what a booby  --  how can I convey  --  how  --  how could you be so  --  so stupid  --  so imbecile  --  live so long  --  know so little  --  how ? Well , it 's too late to learn now.  |p241Arms  slack , Furber leaned back into the angle of the walls and stared at the ceiling . At last he let his eyes drop . Look : if a bird were to rub its beak on a limb , you 'd hear it  --  sure  --  and if a piece of water were to move an unaccustomedway , you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fox were to steal a hen , you 'd see  --  you 'd see it  --  even in the middle of the night ; but , heaven help you , if a friend a friend  --  godwereto slit your throat with his  --  his love  --  hoh , you 'd bleed a week to notice it . Furber tottered weakly across the room . He had achieved a splendid effect . It sickened him . He sank on the bed and threw his head in his hands , yet even that seemed theatrical . He had no knowledge of this man . None . He 'd never seen him before . And all he wanted to do was hit him  --  hit him . When Furber looked up , he was still there  --  waiting . Seen many hangings , Omensetter ? Do their tongues loll out ? Do they turn blue like everybody says , and jerk a lot ? How many struggle before the trap 's sprung , or do they go out praying or cursing the crowd ? Perhaps they 're brought drugged with their heads in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangings you attended all at night , of niggers maybe , slapped up from the rump of a horse or just jerked away communally and left to choke . You wo n't answer . Why not ? Furber beat his knees . It 's not true of Mat , Omensetter said . Do n't you believe me ? Henry 's hung himself in his coat . No , Furber said . No . Of course I do n't believe you . Obvi/ously . God . Believe you . No . You choked him with your great hands as easily as you might lift me up and then you fetched him to the top . No one else could have done it . Omensetter laughed . Oh , he said when he had got his breath , the hands  --  I see  --  with my great hands  --  yes . And he began to laugh again . By all means  --  tee hee . Ho ho ho . And so he 's dead in some tree and looks like an owl . Well , that 's fine . He turns in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine fatuous fool of himself and is now in hell . In a pit of hissing , pissing theologians . All that matters is you trust me . What a godforsaken soul I have . Ba  --  Brackett  --  what a shit I am . Will you go to Chamlay ? I ca n't . I ca n't do that . Tell him what I 've told you , that 's all . I simply ca n't . Say I shall show him where Henry 's hanging and help to take him down . You do n't understand . It 's impossible . Explain just how I am  --  my worry . Convince him that I 'm telling the truth . Make clear the height that Henry 's hanging  --  all that and how sure you are it 's suicide . How sure I am , said Furber wearily . For me . For you . Yes . You 're offering me a kind of bargain ? You said it was your business . There are bargains in business . Just tell him . And good business in bargains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know  --  to have bothered  --  withyou so sick , you know  --  but you can see I hadp243to  --  you can see how it is . You were quick to wonder yourself when I told you that I 'd found him . Furber let his head wobble on his neck . We  --  Lucy and me  --  the girls  --  we are n't used to living by the side of people . I guess that 's it . Lucy thought the girls ought , well , to meet  --  you know  --  though neither Angela or Eleanor seems to care about that  --  well  --  perhaps in time you learn how . . . Furber hugged a pillow in his lap . I thought the weather would be fine for the boy , too , you know , and the excitement of the river . . . I did n't figure right . And so there 'll be a covenant between us . We 'll be going . . . when Henry 's down and buried . That would be right . Are there people living all along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open piece of woods there ? I 'm to convince them , then you 'll go , is that it ? Where will you be ? here ? Oh no . Amos has a cold . . . something . Let them come by , it 's on the way . It 'll have to be tomorrow  --  morning would be wisest  --  an early start . It 's supper time now , and dark . Supper time . Tomorrow 's time enough . Time enough . It 's dark , you say ? I 'll sure be grateful . It 's the business of the minister . . . to intercede . WellMy Aunt Janet was a different sort of suicide . Golly . I 'm sorry . Furber put the pillow beside him . Golly . Old Aunt Janet . Who threw herself from a shelf made of wicker . What points had she thought to consider , the pros and cons of death and life ? He turned inside and recognized at once the passage of the belly , the traverse of the loins , the navigation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here , the cathedral of thep244thorax , a natural cavern . No rare woods here , no perfumed wine , no choirs of boys , but Bael with the head of a man and a spider 's body , cat and toad growing out of his neck , commandingforty-six legions of devils ; Behemoth , full stomachedas Omensetter 's wife had been with her skin like shining satin , but otherwise an elephant devouring grass like the oxen , his whole strength in his loins and his virtue fitted in the button of his belly , commanding thrice seven regiments of furies ; Astaroth , the ugly angel , vulgarly astride a dragon , leading forty legions ; Forcas on a donkey ; Marchocias vomiting ; Buer in a wheel of hooves revolving ; Asmodeus ; Theutus ; Incubus  --  demon after demon drawn delightfully by Angelo , who made God 's finger like an amorous engine for the Vatican . What he really needed was a year abroad to study painting . Do you know very well the words of Jeremiah ? Furber rose as he spoke . Omensetter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first sermon I preached in this church . Omensetter smiled politely . It was hot then . Furber pulled his nightgown about him . And very dry . We had a terrible fire . Burning trees fell in the river . Furber sighed . A catastrophe . What was Henry 's reason ; do you have any idea ? Omensetter shrugged . He was happy when I saw him last , Omensetter said . We 'd been to the hill and he was resting on a log . I do n't know . It was a good day.  |p245A  good day . Well then no reason . You 'll tell Chamlay ? " Take ye heed every one of his neighbor , and trust ye not in any brother . " That 's Jeremiah . Gee . You 'll be cold with just a jacket . You can convince him ? You 'll have no trouble ? Shapes were crowding toward Furber 's eyes . " For death is come up into our windows . . . " Oh , he said , Chamlay ? and he waved his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it will be easy for me.  |p246Eight  came by horseback with a wagon , hurrying against a late sun already weakened by its clouds . Chamlay came , and Olus Knox , Jethro Furber , Israbestis Tott , Hawkins with the Hatstats , George and Menger , then Stitt somehow  --  all ahead of Milo Bencher 's wagon . It was a strong wagon , though small ; one that could be jounced over meadows and got between trees . The men could see Omensetter peering through the window when they arrived , wiping back the glass with his hand . As they entered the yard Omensetter rushed from the house to shout  --  the boy is sick  --  turning from man to man as he did so , trotting anxiously along . His face was pale , bearded ; there were bubbles on his lips which popped when he spoke . Damn near dark , Chamlay said . We got to move . The boy is sick  --  the baby 's sick . Gray and frantic , Omensetter moved from man to man while the dog ran quickly around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The horses were nervous . The dog plunged through Omensetter 's legs and the horses turned , their hoofs destroyingpatches of snow . It 's all true , yes . But I thought you 'd be here this morning . Disappointed , Omensetter turned to Furber . Did n't youHey 's it true ? what did he say ? Yes , yes , Omensetter shouted , yes , it 's true . We 've got no time then ; it 's no job for the dark.  |p247Going  to come hard , Knox said , peering at the sky . Omensetter wound his fingers in the mane of Chamlay 's horse . Was what you said to Furber true ? Better of been , said Hawkins . I shut the store . It 's going to hit thick . Let 's move . Where 's Mat ? Who ? Mat ? He did n't come . Christ , Brackett , come on  --  you got something to ride ? He 's got that horse . He 's got a horse all right . Will this cart-assed wagon make it , Menger asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or will we have to walk ? Told Furber a lot of cock , I bet  --  a lot of shit . Better not of . Christ , come on  --  it 's going to turn on cold . The baby 's sick . Omensetter blotted his nose . Well , you should find him easy if I tell you how , but you ca n't take your horses in , or any wagon either  --  not all the way . The horses tightened about him until the dog barked from between Omensetter 's feet . Then the horses shied but the men reined close again , leaning heavily from their saddles . We 've got no time , Chamlay said . We 're getting old with this waiting . It 's going to snow  --  just look at that  --  we 're due . We 're goingto get it good . Well , you know that long white log there by the creek , Omensetter said . All right , go straightChamlay interrupted with a meaningless shout of anger and instantly the others were shouting too , leaning close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , the girls behind her weeping brokenly , so that the dogp248in a frenzy leaped at Hawkins and Hawkins sprawled him with a blow . He 's throwing up again , Brackett  --  awful  --  an awful something  --  heca n't breathe . Omensetter broke out of the circle and ran heavily into the house . Quickly , in tight aimless patterns , the horses moved . The men rubbed their noses high on their sleeves and watched their streaming mouths . The dog crouched , ears flat , threats shaking in his throat . The horses backed and turned and reared and Stitt cursed when he scraped his leg on Milo Bencher 's wagon . Knox dismounted . It 's nothing to fret about I 'm sure , he said . I 've seen this often ; the least little thing will put them off . Lucy 's way was blocked by the Hatstats ' horses and she vainly tried to go around them . We 've other children too , she said , pushing against the horses . I 've had kids sick before , but never  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look if you do n't mind , Knox said , passing the reins to Tott . Tell him he 's got five minutes , Olus , Luther Hawkins said . Just five . Knox followed Lucy Omensetter running up the steps , Knox nodding nicely to the girls who seemed intent on the horsemen behind their tears . Knox came out in a moment  --  the men were standing by their horses  --  to ask Chamlay where Orcutt was . He was at the Amsterdams ' this morning , Tott said . Em 's bad . Way over there ? God damn this god damn dog , Hawkins said . Is the kid real sick ? Stitt said it was just a stall , and Chamlay went in , Knox after him.  |p249We  'll never get old Henry down today , Stitt said sadly . I 'll have to pull this wagon back to Bencher empty . Where is Bencher anyway  --  in bed with his sheep ? Ai n't the Reverend been quiet , though . You froze your teeth ? I do n't care , by god , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , George said . I do n't mind saying it gives me the trots . Menger whistled his breath toward his brother , and everyonewatched the stream move between them  --  boil out , widen , disappear . Shit . George rubbed his nose again upon his sleeve . Hee-hawing bastard . Henry 's not in any tree , Menger said , any more than George is , hey George ? any more than me . Stitt said that they were fools for being there , and Furber sneezed , Tott saying after : bless . You ever hear a tale like that , Stitt said . I understand one time , Tott said , that Milo Bencher  --  Got stuck in Granny Amsterdam . Oh shut , will you . I do n't care , I never heard a tale like that . Ever hear a turd talk ? Hawkins tied his horse . I know what it 'd sayIt 'd say plop . I 'd say , let 's hang the mother-fucking bastard by the balls , said Hawkins . Cut it out  --  the kids . For now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porch rail , their eyes at the horses . You kids got names , Menger asked  --  and they ran inside . Agnes and Emerald . No kidding ? Finally the men laughed a little and walked up and downp250in the yard crushing pieces of snow . A horse warmly relieved . Clouds of moisture swirled over its dung . By the balls , Hawkins said . Forty feet in the air . With a length of barb from a rusted fence . Then Omensetter and Chamlay appeared with Knox behind them and Omensetter was saying yes yes in a hoarse voice as they came down the steps  --  he needs a doctor  --  while the dog ran up to his boots . Curtis was stern and Olus angry . Somebody ought to go for Orcutt , Chamlay said . I said he was sick , said Omensetter dully . Orcutt was over to the Amsterdams ' this morning , Tott said . No telling where he 's got to by now . He was brought in smaller than his sisters . . . but a bawler . He 's quiet now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You should have sent for Orcutt long ago , Knox said fiercely . Maybe , Omensetter mumbled , holding the sides of his jaw . I had to go see Furber first , you know . Why ? Anyway you 've had all day , god damn it . If Henry 's hanging where you say , Knox said , then what 's the hurry ? My god man , your son is sick  --  sick serious . What 's a lifeless body by him ? If he was mineHell , if Henry 's where you sayDo they do a lot of good ? doctors ? I 've always wondered if it was n't better to let things run along their natural way . God 's will , Furber muttered . That 's been my feeling . Omensetter smiled weakly and spread his arms . What a lot of shit , George Hatstat said . You 've let things run too far already . Knox gestured angrily with his glasses . You should have gone for Orcutt right away , he said . You did n't  --  you could n't  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child on your conscience , Omensetter , Chamlay said . Conscience ? conscience ? Knox carefully put his glasses on and peered at Omensetterclosely . What have we seen shows he has a conscience ? Hey , Stitt said , did you guys just come out here to drop your pants , or shall we get ? Omensetter went about the yard among the horses and past the men , looking at them dumbly as he passed them like a beast himself , and at the trampled ground between them with such sorrow that his whole face had to twitch when he raised it to their faces to form it for the animal passivity it wore . His eyes were rimmed and seemed so deeply sunken they must have seen continually through shadow , and his formerly full cheeks now had the look of crumpled paper . His breathing was audible and slow , his movements heavy , remote from any mind . I can still remember coming , Curtis , Omensetter said quietly at last . Clouds  --  the river  --  Gilean by it  --  the air so clear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barn banked proper to the weather . . . The trees were bare , I remember , and as we came down the hill we could see the tracks of the wagons glistening . You could see what your life would be . You know  --  like the gypsy woman who can take your fortune from your hand . Well I took those tracks to be a promise to me . . . And on the way we 'd all been singing . Rose Alymer . I heard it sung so strangely once I never forgot it . The words are high and fine beyond my understanding but I like their sound . And we counted kinds of birds . . . I guess you think  --  well , what does it matter ? I do n't know ... I remember there were rings in the pools of water by the road , and I thought how exciting for the boy to live by the river , to catch fish and keep frogs , you know ; grow up with good excitement . Now he 's gone sick , Curtis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover it or cold to hold it firmly even , and the hill we came by is still a slippery yellow . The boy is going to die , Curtis . I just feel  --  I 'm scared he 's going to die . He 's dreadful sick , I know . You 've seen him , you and Olus know he 's going to die . Why  --  he 's barely been alive . . . The boy  --  the boy , too  --  he was a promise to me . I hold he was a promise to me . If he dies  --  well you were all  --  too  --  promises . Curtis ? Olus ? George ? Remember ? Was n't there a promise to me ? He 'll die soon , my son will- soon he 'll be dead of this low ground and its dishonest weather . I 'll cut that on his stone . If he ever has a stone . I do n't think that I can bring myself to put him in this clay . I 'll put him on a mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whoever lives so little and so low as he has should spend his death up high  --  like Henry 's doing . Chamlay rose on his horse . In his life he only knew his mother . Knox rose . I hold there was a promise  --  Gilean was . Menger rose . George rose . All right  --  it does n't matter . Stitt rose . Tott rose . Hawkins rose . I hope no one will send for Doctor Orcutt now . He 'll not be needed . I 've changed my mind . He 's worse , Brackett , Lucy shouted from the porch . Please wo n't one of you find Doctor Orcutt ? Brackett ? Please . His tongue  --  he does n't breathe  --  someone  --  please  --  there 's blood  --  I think there 's blood . No , Omensetter said , no , and his wife faintly echoed him , astonished , no ? our child ? Brackett ? My son , said Omensetterwearily . He drew himself together with an effort . There was a promise to me and it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's this , she whispered.  |p253The  Reverend Jethro Furber 's Change of HeartI 'll go , missus , Israbestis said ; I 've a notion where Doc is if he saw Emma Amsterdam this morning . No , Omensetter cried , rushing at Tott and grasping his arm . Bessie , you know him , you know how his teeth slide in his beard , Omensetter said , leaning close ; no , I do n't want him . Lucy groaned . Mother , one of the daughters called , and the girls ' cries drew her in . Omensetter kept his grip on Israbestis . Bessie , he said , do n't go , do n't go , I hate his eyes , they cross . You know his eyes . They 're stitched to him . Tott twisted away .
