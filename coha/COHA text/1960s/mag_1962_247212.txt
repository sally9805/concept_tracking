If Senate doings were accompanied by background music , a fitting theme for last week 's most notable and ignoble performance would have been the tune of the old song that runs : Oh , the noble Duke of York , He had ten thousand men , He marched them up to the top of the hill , And he marched them down again . <P> Up the Hill . One deceptively quiet afternoon , the Senate was considering that familiar bale of hay , the foreign aid authorization bill . The speechmakers droned away in a nearly deserted chamber . Majority Leader Mike Mansfield was off in his own office , conferring with a passel of Democratic Senators about the Administration 's tax-revision bill . The only firecracker expected to make any noise in connection with the foreign aid bill was Wisconsin 's Democrat William Proxmire 's amendment to bar aid ( but not shipments of surplus food ) to Yugoslavia for one year . Even Proxmire 's staffers admitted that they did not expect the amendment to pass . <P> All of a sudden , Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offered an amendment to the Proxmire amendment . <P> Lausche 's proposal : Ban all kinds of U.S. aid , including surplus food , to " any country known to be dominated by Communism or Marxism . " That would include Poland ( which was to have got $60 million worth of surplus food ) as well as Yugoslavia ( which was to have got $80 million in foodstuffs , plus other aid ) . <P> After 20 minutes of lackluster debate , the clerk began calling the roll for a vote on the Lausche amendment . The Senate 's Democratic leadership was caught flat-footed-not for the first time this year . <P> When word of what was going on reached Mansfield 's office , the meeting abruptly broke up , and Democrats scurried toward the Senate floor . Just after the clerk finished calling the roll , some two dozen Democratic Senators surged into the chamber , began gesturing to get their votes recorded . Amid the confusion , many Senators got only a sketchy notion of what was being voted on , and since the amendment seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe and vote against Communism . Final tally : 57 for the amendment . 24 against . <P> Down Again . In the State Department , it is an article of faith that aid to Yugoslavia and Poland helps the West by lessening those countries ' dependence on Russia-a belief that has survived Tito 's numberless demonstrations of hostility toward the U.S. So the Administration , predictably , put up a brisk fight against the Lausche amendment . President Kennedy himself telephoned Majority Leader Mansfield and Minority Leader Everett Mc-Kinley Dirksen . White House staffers and State Department officials , including Secretary of State Dean Rusk , called other Senators to ask for help .
