At the halfway point in its battle against Italy for the Bermuda Bowl early this month the American team was very much in contention  --  only 3 IMPs behind . But when the team fell 45 IMPs back with only 32 boards to go , desperate tactics were called for . Nonplaying Captain Julius Rosenblum followed the traditional strategy for a team in need of quick points and benched his steadiest pair , Edgar Kaplan and Norman Kay , in favor of his swing-getters . Captain Rosenblum got his big swing  --  a 17 IMP haymaker ( below )  --  but it was against his own team . End of contest . // In the closed room the Italians trotted out one of Giorgio Belladonna 's pet conventions in the Roman System . Walter Avarelli 's two-club bid showed a weakish three-suiter  --  with a stronger one , he would have opened two diamonds . If West 's hand had been strong enough to make a game possible , he could have bid two no trump , asking opener to mention his short suit . Instead , West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bill Root 's reopening double was the sound tactic once the opponents had found a fit , and Alvin Roth 's pass was based on a mistaken impression that they had failed to find it . // It was a costly decision . Belladonna won the first trick with dummy 's king of hearts , cashed the ace of clubs and ruffed a club , then led the king of spades . North ducked , but declarer simply abandoned the trump suit and took a successful finesse against South 's queen of hearts . The defenders collected two diamonds and two spades , and Belladonna chalked up two spades doubled , with an overtrick , for a score of +870 . Worse was to follow , as the crowd watching on Bridge-O-Rama heard this bidding : // SOUTH ( Forquet ) // PASS 1 Heart 2 Club 4 Club // WEST ( Murray ) // PASS 1 Spade 2 Spade DOUBLE // NORTH ( Garozzo ) // PASS PASS 3 Club ALL PASS // EAST ( Kehela ) // 1 Diamond PASS 3 Spade // Opening lead : 7 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diamond ace and led a heart to the jack and king . Sammy Kehela returned the trump 9 , and Eric Murray let it run to dummy 's jack . Forquet could now have made his contract by cashing the king of diamonds and playing a spade-heart crossruff , but unaccountably he ruffed a spade before leading a diamond to the king . As a result , after ruffing another spade and a heart , declarer was forced to come off dummy by ruffing a third diamond , enabling Murray to overruff with the ace of clubs and return his last trump . The contract was now wide open to defeat , but on this trick Kehela let go of his remaining spade instead of his 8 of hearts . Declarer won the club in his hand , and ruffed a heart with dummy 's last trump , felling Murray 's ace . Dummy had to lead a diamond to Kehela 's queen  --  but Kehela was left with a heart and declarer 's queen of hearts made the fulfilling trick . // Close to tears , Kehela could barely gulp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Sammy , " Murray replied . " I probably should n't have doubled . Besides , I should have opened a trump . " He was right on both counts . We lost 17 IMPs , but had the contract been set 200 , we 'd still have lost 12 . Either way , the 1967 title was gone .
