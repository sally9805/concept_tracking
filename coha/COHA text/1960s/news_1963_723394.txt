txt James Farmer , national director of the Congress of Racial Equality , said yesterday that the city was " on the threshold " of an agreement to end discrimination in the construction industry . He said the agreement went " beyond anything that has already been announced " and would be concluded possibly within the next two weeks . Appearing on WNBC-TV 's " Searchlight " program , the CORE official asserted : " I think we 're on the threshold of something . I think all- parties involved now want to reach a solution . I think it will come more quickly than we originally thought . " But before any settlement is accepted by civil rights leaders , he added , it will have to be approved by " the people on the streets and on the picket lines . " " There will be no settlement behind closed doors , " he said . " The representatives of all the civil rights organizations in the city will take it to their memberships for approval or rejection . " Mr. Farmer said the next civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said boycotts and " study-ins " might be used when schools reopened next month . He declared he was in favor // of transferring student by bus to achieve desegregation . " When you 're working in the heart of the ghetto , there is no solution except bussing , " he said . As he was speaking , civil rights demonstrators continued to sit in at Goverpor Rockefeller 's office at 22 West 55th Street , and at City Hall . Meanwhile , the city 's plans to open 17 offices for job registration today met a procedural snag . The scheduled 9 A.M. opening of the offices will be officially delayed , probably until noon . A spokesman for the City Department of Labor said , however , that people going to the offices would be taken care of . The delay was attributed to the complexity of starting the operation .

Young Jr. , executive director of the National Urban League , yesterday called on Mayor Wagner to set up a " crash " job-training program for Negroes and Puerto Ricans . Speaking on WCBS - TV 's " Newsmakers " program , he declared that equal opportunity is an " empty , meaningless slogan unless we have crash programs to see that citizens scarred through generations of deprivation are brought to the place where they can take advantage of these opportunities . " Funds Held Hard to Get In a telephone interview yesterday , a spokesman for Mr. said that if the city 's job training program was inadequate it was largely because of the city 's inability to get Federal funds . He said that the city was entitled to $3,500,000 for job training under the Manpower Development Training ? Act , which became effective in July , 1962 . But the act provides that any program must be approved by the state 's Departments of Education and Labor , the Federal Department of Labor , ' the Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Board of Education . " This is a fantastic obstacle course , " he asserted . Mr. Young , said Negroes should receive preference in both employment and job training for 10 years . After that , he asserted , they would feel they had achieved " true equality : ' He conceded that Peter J. Brennan , president of the ' 122-union Building and Construction Trades Council , was correct in saying last week that the Negroes want discrimination in reverse . " But we do n't need 300 years of preferential treatment which the white people have had , " he said . " Ten years would be adequate . " Negro ' Will Not Wait ' Discussing current unemployment in the construction industry , he said Negroes did not seek to take jobs away from white laborers . But the Negro " will not wait for all the whites to have full employment before seeking jobs for themselves .

" We ca n't train people for employment until they have this basic knowledge , " he said . He said the city hoped to convert a summer literacy program , called " Operation Second Chance , " now under way In five schools into a year-round operation .
