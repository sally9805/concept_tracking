TEN VIETNAMESE by Susan Sheehan . 204 pages . Knopf. $4.95 . <P> <P> " When I see an American soldier I feel very sorry for my people . We are so small and dark and underfed compared to Americans . Life must be very good and the work must be easy where they come from . I wonder why they want to come to this poor place ? " <P> -A Peasant Woman <P> " People do n't know which side to take to feel safe . There are so many families with relatives on both sides . <P> I 've seen government hamlet chiefs murdered by Viet Cong guerrillas led by their own nephews . It breaks your heart to see Vietnamese families killing each other like that . " <P> -A Refugee <P> " I do n't think the Viet Cong will kill me . I 'm not worth it . But if they do-well , if I die today , I wo n't have to die tomorrow . " <P> -A Viet Cong Defector <P> These words are spoken by three representatives of Viet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their homeland for more than 20 years . Their stories were collected in 1965 and 1966 in a series of interviews by Susan Sheehan , a New Yorker writer and the wife of Neil Sheehan , who was a New York Times correspondent in Saigon . In addition to this Vietnamese trio , seven other people are presented in the book : a landlord , a Montagnard , an orphan , a Buddhist monk , a Viet Cong , a South Vietnamese soldier , a politician . <P> Where Is Saigon ? For all the difference between these types , there are some constants : the Vietnamese seem to love their villages with an extraordinary passion . Again and again , they speak of the time when the trouble will end and they can go back to the elysium of such hamlets as Gia Hoi or Hoai Chau . So narrow and parochial is their vision that most do not know the name of their province chief or the mayor of the adjoining city . At their hesitant best , the peasants can identify only Ho Chi Minn and the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where or why they have gone . Some do not even know that Viet Nam has been divided into a North and South ; others have heard of Saigon but have no idea where it is . <P> They may be ignorant but far from unintelligent . They have worked hard since the day they were born and have met death at every step of the way . They are burdened by debt , unlucky in their attempts to raise chickens or hogs , which are stolen by the government troops or taken as " taxes " by the Viet Cong if they do not sicken and die first . <P> Solutions . The " politician " ( his real name is not given ) was trained to be a pediatrician , studied in Hanoi and <P> France , and is the only one of the author 's subjects who believes that solutions are possible . He feels that " the United States should be in overt control here . Americans should n't worry about world opinion . The peasants would be glad to have Americans running their districts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Viet Nam . " We have to go on with the war and win it . . . If we accept peace under Communist rule , many thousands of people in South Viet Nam will be sentenced to death by Communist people 's tribunals , as they were in North Viet Nam when the Communists took over .
