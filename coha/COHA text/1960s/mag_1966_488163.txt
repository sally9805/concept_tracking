Toward the close of The Investigation ( at the , Ambassador Theatre ) the main " speaker " pronounces the most ideologically cogent words of the evening . Referring to the mass murders and brutalities that took place at Auschwitz , he says : " Since such a great number of us came into the camp and since the number of those who brought us there was also great , you would think what happened there would still be comprehensible today . " In other words , you the torturers or the bystanders are very much like us the victims , ' and we the victims are as you are : therefore we should all understand one another and be understood . But there 's the rub : we do n't fully understand . And for two reasons . When another witness for the prosecution tells of a 9-year-old boy in the camp who ; on being complimented by one of the camp 's personnel for being " smart , " answers " yes , I know a lot , but I do n't think I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train which is to carry him to the gas chambers , bidding farewell to the authorities with " you will never be forgiven , " we are moved  --  or , mare exactly , I am ' , moved . I am moved because the incident is not only singular but " modest . " The vastness and impersonality in the trial of twenty- ' one persons who participated in the , destruction of 4 million prisoners at the German concentration camp of Auschwitz , as we read about it and more emphatically as it is enacted on the stage , tends to anesthetize our sensibilities and thus our comprehension . I felt the horror of Nazism in 1933 when first I heard of the burning of the books . Certainly such an action is in no way comparable to the gasing of thousands of people . But the literary holocaust inspired me with a sense of the terrible iniquity of the Nazi ' spirit . When immediately after Hitler 's advent to poWer the composer Roger Sessions , who had spent a winter in Germany in 1932. told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of when he had read a letter Hitler had sent some of his cohorts praising them for having kicked a Communist to death somewhere in a provincial town , I strongly felt the imminence of doom that was to befall Germany and Europe . When much later ; I saw a ? photograph in P.M. ( the liberal daily of the forties ) of a storm trooper in a Berlin street amusing himself and a group of his companions by plucking out , one by one , the hairs from an old Jew 's beard , I shivered with dread and compassion . Such moments  --  so mild compared to the later humiliations and tortures ' suffered by millions  --  made a deeper impression on me than the prolonged accounts of scientifically organized savagery recorded in The Investigation , which is Peter Weiss 's verbatim arrangement of the testimony presented at the trial held in Frankfurt ' from January , 1964 , ' to August , .1965 . ' What I failed to understand before the war but have recently begun to understand is how it could be that so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat which Hitler and his like represented . I remember a party given in London shortly before Munich at which I strongly voiced the need for a common front against the Nazis . A well-known English actress turnect to me , and said coolly , " You think that ' because Hitler is bent on destroying your people . " I have since wondered what that lady was thinking soon after when the bombs fell on " her people " ! This trifling incident made painfully clear to me how obtuse and callous people can be , while a library of documents and statistics may induce little more than a state ? of inanition in us ( or me ) . I am reminded of the character of the chaplain Stogumber in Shaw 's Saint Joan . He will listen to no extenuating considerations on Joan 's behalf : he incessantly demands that she be burned . But when lie sees her burn he cries out in agony , indeed goes Mad with guilt . We need , some measure of personal contact to comprehend the reality of things outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may supply such contact : The Investigation is not art . Still it probably functions as a shattering event where It is presented to an audience which m one way or another has been intimately involved with its horizon : in Germany . Poland , Russia or France , in brief , with people who have been brought into close confrontation with it . On Broadway , though we should not Categorically set its audience down as unfeeling , The Investigation may prove a " shocker " but not a truly meaningful occasion . It will not get under the audience 's skin , it will not " teach them a lesson " It is in the nature of most of us to retreat from the face of evil and avoid the sight or even the recollection of torment ( This , to a degree , may be a boon ) Art , I repeat , may provide the bridge between the tragic and terrible aspects of existence and our frightened consciousness , but The Investigation on our stage is now simply a fever chart  --  impersonal by its very elaboration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation is not in the accepted sense a " play , " I must approach it in its own terms  --  beyond the theatre . The very day I saw it , a nice American , a person whom most of us would describe as " a man of good will , " one furthermore who saw and was appalled by the concentration camps , was quoted as saying that he would not automatically preclude anything , including the use of nuclear weapons , to end the war in Vietnam " When you appeal to force , " he added , " to carry out the policies of America abroad , there is no court above you " Perhaps it has n't occurred to the gentleman or to those who may agree with him that if nuclear war succeeded in wiping out the enemy in Vietnam it would al the same time eliminate most of our friends as well . No wonder there are folk who could not recognize the menace of the Nazi state of mind , or who now try to ignore what happened , or yet again fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places and people 11 is so very difficult for us to learn anything important from hearsay or history we must first learn to ree . There is wisdom in the French use of the word bete to mean both ' beast " and " stupid . " Our bestiality does not arise so much from vindictiveness or wickedness as from stupidity It is a trait universally shared It takes enormous effort on our part to turn the " beasts " we are into human beings A final word about Peter Weiss 's text itself Apart from the details of ferocious cruelty it presents , certain of its elements are unparticularized When one of the Nazi hirelings speaks of how " they had to be rooted out . " we do not know whom " they " refers to , except to the vicunas in general There is no mention of pacifists , Socialists , Communists or Jews It is a fact that the Auschwitz camp was chiefly an instrument in the " final solution " ? the extermination of Jews as such But Weiss has said he wished to de-emphasize this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people like all others , might in certain circumstances behave as murderously to others as their persecutors had done to them Without arguing the speciousness of this reasoning , it must he plain that so interpreted , The Ins es/tension should strike an audience as more nihilistic than At watISade . The point here is not made for its own sake alone but for the light it sheds on a major defect in the proceedings Weiss intended to make his documentary as factual as possible but it ends by seeming abstract It is not the abstraction of art On the contrary , it neutralizes the effect of the performance . That is why I can say very little about the production Many of the " faces " are well chosen The text is well spoken The style shifts fi on ) reportorial reading to one of suggested emotion and then again to straight " acting " or illustration We are neither in a real courtroom of real people nor within an original and self-justifying stage form . The great Russian director Meyer-hold was severely brought to task when he chose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1934 It was a decadent play , so went the complaint , and hardly literature Mel erhold defended himself by saying that though the play was old-fashioned in workmanship and writing , it still contained values in its indirect criticism of the old bourgeoisie . Seeing the revival of George Kaufman and Edna Ferber 's Dinner at Eight at the Alvin Theatre , I fancied that Tyrone Guthrie thought of this play of the early thirties as a sort of American restoration comedy , frivolous in manner , satiric in content : , a kind of classic . Despite my abiding skepticism in the matter , his production almost persuades me that he may have been right . The people invited to a swank dinrier party are all shallow and innocent . They are a shallow lot , in the first place , because the play is ; they are innocent because Guthrie has made them so . Oliver Jordan , the reluctant and ailing host , is the owner of a respected shipping line verging on bankruptcy ; his wife Millicent is a featherbrained " society lady . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those days ' ' There is none now . ) The Jordans hardly seem to have any blood kinship with their daughter . The guests of honor ( who never show up ) are an English lord and lady whom the Jordans barely know . Invited to the dinner too is Jordan 's doctor , an indifferent rake who is having a casual affair With a floosie , , fOrmerly a night-club hat check girl , now married to a vulgar and crooked operator out of Montana , a man who in the course of the play cheats his ho'st out of his business . The Jordan girl is having a do with a silent movie star on the skids ; he commits suicide because , besides harsher humiliations , he hasn'tenough money to pay for a taxi to take him to the party . Among those invited , there is also an actress past her prime ( more " personality " than artist ) now comfortably retired , though worried as she is no longer able to elicit favors in jewels or furs from ardent admirers . The chauffeur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the maid . Not a nice group . Did the play offend anyone by its " realism " or nastiness when first produced in 1932 ? Not at all : no one believed any of it . It was entertainment . There were good parts ( several of them memorably played ) , fashionable gowns , and a blazing blonde snuggled in a sumptuous bed . Some such things might also be said of restoration comedy . It is vicious but artificial enough to pass as fun , What keeps it alive is the brilliance of its writing , its wicked wit . What probably made Guthrie believe in Dinner at Eight is its clever construction and box-office shrewdness . But beyond that I suspect he felt that the wealthy middle class is very much now as it was thirty-five years ago not corrupt so much as silly . If the play were more literate , its people more than-the sketchiest of stage effigies , he might have a point . To convince us that the play exists as a play Guthrie felt he could rely on his immense gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busi , ness . For example , when the floosie is berated and very nearly beaten by her crude keeper , she consoles herself by cuddling a teddy bear . In fear of actual fisticuffs , Guthrie has the girl cower in her clothes closet among the silks and satins . When Mrs. Jordan is informed that the lobster aspic is not to be served at dinner ( it was destroyed in the battle between the chauffeur and butler ) she cries out in tones of Attic tragedy , " No aspic for dinner ! " And the whole fracas of conflicting thematic chords at the curtain of the second act is hilarious . The final scene of the play too in which the hosts and all the guests hover in the drawing room before dinner is conducted like a Pavane , each couple adding another note of dignified dissonance to the grand exit to the feast which of course is a total bust . Why despite these assets does the show work to a limited degree only ? For two reasons : Guthrie shapes the scenes and external characterizations with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sufficiently sharp sense of type and does not help those he has cast with anything beyond their movements and byplay . Like most English directors he leaves the basic acting problems to the cast Itself . Many of the players , whatever their age , seem too young for their parts . This in a way is a social phenomenon . Amencans of 40 in bygone days looked like people with forty years of life experience . Many of the present cast somehow strike one as kids . If the play were done by kids ( at a regional or university theatre , let us say ) , the show might come closer to Guthrie 's conception of it as a perhaps meaningful frolic . If the actors seemed more mature , if there were greater type verisimilitude in the casting , the play 's satiric potential might be realized . Guthrie is a man without malice , so the pla ? has no sting , and for gay sport the actors are not free or extravagant enough . Most of them , working loyally and intelligently , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exception should be made for Blanche Yurka as the Jordan cook and for Daniel Keyes in a bit part as a justifiably irascible square . Pamela Tiffin is luscious and comes off well because her youth and softness ( she is not the 29-year-old toughie of the script ) give the role wistfulness ( she curtsies every time she meets a guest at the dinner party ) , a quality which seems to correspond to Guthrie 's sense of the play . If this is so , 1 conclude that he has not succeeded in finding a clearly marked style to serve his interpretation or his enthusiasm . Off-Broadway organizations are beginning to get the idea : it is well worth while , it may even prove a pleasure , to see " old " American plays . Of course most of them will be " dated , " but may that not be part of their charm ? Why is a play which smacks of its period necessarily dull ? A person who speaks of himself as " a man of the sixties " makes me think : " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No wonder we have so much difficulty in growing up . Now that the Wilder one-acters have attracted an audience numerous enough to warrant moving them to the Orpheum Theatre on Second Avenue , the City Center has initiated an American Playwrights Series with The Country Girl by Clifford Odets . The weakness of the series ( but no reason for scorning it ) is that the plays may be insufficiently rehearsed ? although Stanislaysky once said . " If you have n't time enough to rehearse a play for as long as it should be rehearsed , two weeks will do " The Country Girl is the thinnest of Odets ' plays ( Is it too cynical to say that that is one cause for its having been more successful than several other of his better plays9 ) It is straightforward , clear and effective on a simple level . It is warmed by the subjective heat of Odets ' desire to explain certain of his own personal flaws and to confess his need for the help of a patient and trusting woman , as well as for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theatre . It is above all a play which demands superb acting . While Uta Hagen was excellent in the original ( 1951 ) production , Paul Kelly was not up to the central part . Michael Red-grave , on reliable report , played it magnificently in London where the play was a solid hit . Franchot Tone was scheduled to play the role at City Center and began rehearsing it when he fell ill . My guess is that he would have been very fine . Joseph Anthony stepped in . He plays the failing old actor well but it is not " his " part . He makes sense but not pathos . What the part calls for is an aura of grandeur . As the actor 's wife , Jennifer Jones comports herself nicely rather than impressively Rip Torn as the director who works with fierce devotion to restore the actor 's confidence and powers is most fittingly cast . I was glad to see the play again .                   @ @
