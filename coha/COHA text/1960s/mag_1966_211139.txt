An English-Polynesian starlet named Laya Raki tore off her bikini top for photographers at the Venice Film Festival last week , but that was mostly because she was only an English-Polynesian starlet named Laya Raki and it was the Venice Film Festival . <P> That sort of headline hugging makes it tough on the average starlet who is eager enough for the spotlight but does n't care to go quite that far to attract it . And so Tanya Lopert , girl starlet and daughter of a United Artists vice president , had to be content with something less spectacular but considerably more ladylike . With Daddy in tow , Tanya made her big entrance at a party at the Palazzo Ca ' Rezzonico , dressed in a spangled magenta mini-gown slit to the thigh . <P> The occasion seemed to be all Tanya 's when what to the wandering eye should appear but an ex-stripper named Rita Renoir in an openwork crocheted gown under which she wore only a nostalgic G string . Worse yet , Princess **40;1033;TOOLONG von Furstenburg , known to her friends as Ira @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That threw Tanya into a snit . Ira , she complained , was " taking work away from girls who need it . " Tanya finally called a press conference to explain everything , but she called it for the same hour that just about everybody was elsewhere attending an old Greta Garbo movie . <P> Different Morals . If Tanya botched her week in Venice , she certainly did n't do any worse than the producers and directors who supplied movies to the competition . Of the 14 films entered in the festival , only Sweden 's Night Games , Britain 's Fahrenheit 451 and a joint Italian-Algerian production of The Battle of Algeria elicited any serious critical approval . <P> The reception of Night Games was roiled by turbulence over its moral quotient . Directed by Sweden 's Mai Zet-terling , the film is an eerie story of a mother-and-son 's investigation of every forbidden game : masturbation , incest , sodomy , necrophilia , golf . It was shown only to the press and the festival jury , but Venice 's Giovanni Cardinal Urbani felt obliged " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Director Zetterling , a 41-year-old former actress who learned her trade from Ingmar Bergman : " Censorship is such a highly complex affair . Things of violence , war , crimes-in Sweden this is the only thing we cut . But in another country , there are different moral values . " <P> The Battle of Algeria , Gillo Pontecorvo 's earnest , overlong semi-documentary about the bitter struggle for Algerian independence , impressed the judges so much that they awarded it the festival 's Gold Lion , even as it outraged the touchy French . Fahrenheit 451 earned quieter but more general appreciation . Directed by France 's gifted Francois Truffaut ( Jules and Jim ) and blessed by the presence in the leads of Julie Christie and Oskar Werner , Fahrenheit is a Ray Bradbury story that takes a disturbing look at a future world in which the printed word is forbidden and every last book is burned . ( The temperature of the title is that at which " a book catches fire and turns to ashes . " )         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
