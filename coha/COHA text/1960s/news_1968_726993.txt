txt The financial markets of Europe gave an initial vote of confidence today to the modification of the monetary system announced lyesterday in Washington . The announcement created a twoprice gold market . In New York , the stock market surged upward in early trading , then lost much of its strength . Page 61 . Central bankers of seven Western nations agreed to maintain the official , $35-anounce price for dealings among nations , but to allow the freemarket price to fluctuate according to supply and demand . The first free gold market transactions were at prices well below those expected by speculators . The dollar strengthened against the major continental currencies . The pound , which plummeted on Friday on rumors of devaluation this weekend , bounced back smartly and closed above its $2.40 parity . All eyes were on gold , and with the big London bullion market closed until April 1 , attention centered on Zurich , the other leading European gold center . About three-quarters of the gold sold in London goes to Zurich banks which , operating under strict customer-secrecy rules , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Zurich banks had been building up private stocks of gold so that they could make a market even with their principal source of supply  --  London ? closed . Price Driven Down The banks first offered gold this morning at $43 an ounce . At this price additional offerings came from speculators and the price ? fluctuated between $37 and $40 . The banks closed the market at $40 . It had been widely expected that once monetary gold  --  stopped moving into private hoards , which was the result of yesterday 's decision by central bankers , in Washington , the price would rise . at least 50 per cent above the official level of $35 an ounce . This would have put it above $50 an ounce . Zurich gold dealers reported volume of about 10 to 15 tons , which was sharply below the levels handled in recent days . In Paris , where the international significance of the gold market does not compare with those in either Zurich or London , calmer conditions returned . The Paris closing price matched  --  Zurich 's $40 an ounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do as the biggest supplier of newly mined gold . In South Africa , South Africa 's Finance Minister Nicolaas Diederichs said the Government would reserve its position on selling gold until the situation was clearer . The South African central bank had been selling all the gold it did not reserve for its own monetary needs to London , using the Bank of England as its agent . With the London market closed , the South Africans have not yet informed the Bank of England of their intentions . 20 Tons-a . Week Bankers in Zurich and London felt the South Africans would probably opt now for splitting up their sales , shipping part to London after April 1 , part to other Continental centers and , possibly , some directly to central banks . South Africa normally shipped about 20 tons of gold a week to London . This metal was then fed into the market by the Bank of England . The pound forged ahead in foreign exchange dealings , making an enormous gain for a single day ? $1.25 to $2.4025 . Tomorrow 's budget , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the year , was expected to be unusually severe , as the nation tried to get into a position of substantial surplus in its balance of payments . This would mean a sharp cutback in consumer spending , most likely through still higher taxes and other austerity measures . The huge , persistent payments deficits of Britain and the United States , the two reserve currency nations , have been the root causes of the troubles in the monetary system . The deficits produced crises of confidence in the two currencies , the dollar coming under speculative attack with the massive gold buying of the last two weeks . Eyes on Washington Tomorrow 's British budget would play an important role in the plan of central bankers to bring stability to the monetary system , but the key element continued to be what Washington would do to reduce the American deficit . European bankers believe the dual-price system might produce the desired stability , at least temporarily , provided the United States also took tough action to restore confidence . Few saw it , however , as a permanent solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system could lead to new forms of settling international accounts , supplementing  --  and perhaps even eventually supplanting  --  gold . But without this confidence , the monetary system could regress and become subject once again to the vagaries of South African mining production . In an exchange with Conservative lain in the i-iouse of Commons today , Roy Jenkins , chancellor of the exchequer , said the two-end system was the " best thing " that could have come out of Washington . " I do not see why the arrangements which have been made should not restore stability for a considerable time , " Mr. Jenkins added .
