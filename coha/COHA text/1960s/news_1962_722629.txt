Not Women ! , " Sept. 2 ) is so right . When seeking employment after graduating law school , one of my first interviews was with a senior partner in a respected , medium - size law firm . Even though we had arranged the interview by telephone ( so he knew I was a woman ) , he declined to see me in his office , but kept me standing in the reception room while we talked . He told me that I was wasting my time there because ( 1 ) all the men in the office were married , so if I was looking for a husband , I 'd be out of luck and ( 2 ) he could n't employ a woman because he did not think of women as equal . Rather , all women should be put on a pedestal , as was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a proper retort . Since then , I have had plenty of time to marshal my arguments . Unfortunately even the best arguments do not work . The answer , I believe , lies in legislation . Equal pay is not enough . The state law against discrimination in employment should be amended to include sex as one of the categories upon which a determination of eligibility for employment may not be based . ? JOAN STERN K/OK . New York . LOWLY STATUS To THE EDITOR : The motivation for a woman 's working is exactly the same as that for a man 's  --  the education of children , the elevation of living standards of the family , and self-realization resulting from doing work for which she has both education and qualifications , The Negro secured the vote in 1870 ; the woman in 1920 ? an interval of fifty years  --  indicating that women , statuswise , are a more subjugated , more reluctantly recognized political minority than the Negro . RUTH B. KUNDSIN . Boston , Mass . WOMEN 'S DUTIES It always astonishes me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graham 's , there is never any mention of women 's duties . And yet a democracy can only give equal rights against equal duties . We have yet to hear women 's claims for equal duties , such as two or four years in the armed services , pr the legal duty to support husband and children , or the payment of alimony to jilted husbands . It seems to me that the girls are already more than equal as it is , and if you add equal pay and equal job opportunities , the boys who have to leave the field to their female competitors in their jobs in order to answer the call of duty will become more unequal than the women ever were . H. BAENNINGER . Upper Montclair , N. J. ' MORE TROUBLE ' TO THE EDITOR : While I sympathize with the working woman 's plight , I think there are some reasons for it that are not cited in Miss Graham 's article . As one employer told me recently , " Women are fine and we could not do without them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Although he was not specific , one of the troubles , I suspect from my own observations , is dependability . In many cases , when a woman employe becomes dependable , she resigns . Whatever the reason ? to marry , to have a baby , to accept a more lucrative position elsewhere , or just plain boredom  --  she is vacating a job which the employer must train someone else to fill . And this one , too , may leave at the slightest whim or provocation . Women are noted for changing their minds , and this appears to be also true in the business world . RALPH COKAIN . New York , LADIES IN POLITICS TO THE EDITOR : Miss Graham complains about the fact that women do not achieve as much in politics as she considers their just due . She seems aghast at the fact that only 2 per cent of the Senators are women . She implies that properly over onehalf should be women  --  after all they hold 25 per cent of the vote and represent almost 51 per cent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : of the total labor force of 74,000,000 only 21 , - 000,000 ( about one-third ) are females-41,000,000 women are not in the labor force , 34,000 , - 000 of that 41,000,000 because they are keeping house . So of those available to be employed as Senators , only one-third are female . And what about that one-third ? A good many of that one-third are not as well qualified by education as their male counterparts . In 1950. only about 32 per cent of those enrolled in college and professional schools were female . ( Here again we see the fundamental cause at work . ) Miss Graham has ignored another very important fact that must be taken into consideration in determining what is the " proper " number of female Senators . That is that only about 10 per cent of married women between the ages of 30 and 34 are childless . This means that a very large number of women devote ten to twenty of their most productive years to raising their family . What man could aspire to rise to a position of prominence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend a comparable period similarly engaged ? ALimnr F. KNIGHT . Highland Park , N. J. DEDUCT SITTERS To THE EDITOR : Miss Graham asks , " Why should a man be allowed to deduct the salary of his secretary while a working mother ca n't deduct the expense of a baby-sitter ? " This , to me , does not illustrate discrimination against women , which is the author 's premise , since an individual in business , regardless of sex , may deduct the salary of a secretary . Moreover , this statement is incorrect in reference to the baby - sitter , since the Federal tax law provides as follows : " There is allowed a // // deduction not to exceed a total of $600 for expenses paid by a woman for the care of one or more dependants if such care is to enable the taxpayer to be gainfully employed or actively to seek gainful employment . " HERBERT D. ROSENBLUTH . Verona , N. J. SAVE TEMPLE ? TO THE EDITOR : In her letter of Aug. 26 , Regina Hersh expressed the hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II from inundation when the Aswan High Dam is completed in Egypt . May I suggest to Miss Hersh that there are many human needs requiring our attention , and pressing problems that cry for solution . The forty-three million dollars needed to save this useless mass of concrete would serve humanity better if spent on any one of these needs . Let us remember that this " mighty works of the Pharaohs " was accomplished through slave labor and served only to satisfy the egotism of these ruling Pharaohs . This is hardly a culture to be proud of . As long as children in depressed areas are shoeless , the idea of using American dollars in support of this plan is disgusting . WILLIAM KELLER . River Vale , N. J. A QUESTION ON LOBBIES TO THE EDITOR : Toward the conclusion of his article , " A Senator Looks at the Lobbies " ( Aug. 19 ) , Senator Eugene McCarthy wrote , " * * ? the act of lobbying is basically an exercise of the right to petition the Government  --  a right set forth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but those of us studying this complicated area have found considerable legal question raised as to whether foreign governments  --  or those American citizens paid for such services by foreign governments  --  fully share in this Constitutional guarantee of the unlimited right to petition . This is not to say that foreign governments or their representatives do not have a right to petition our Government  --  they certainly do and the regular diplomatic channels between ambassadors or Embassy officials to the Department of . State are available for just such a purpose . There is a serious doubt in the Minds of many lawyers , however as to whether the lobbyist for Country X 's state sugar monopoly has the same Constitutional rights and privileges of petition as the lobbyist for the sugar beet growers in Senator McCarthy 's home state of Minnesota . I would also like to offer two slight corrections to the Senator 's interesting article . He indicates that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee investigation in this area stemmed from disclosure of the Sugar Act lobbyists . Our committee study had begun long before the Sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was with material developed by the committee staff studying foreign government representation that I was able to first outline before the Senate Finance Committee and later on the Senate floor , the existence of the highly paid sugar lobbyists . Further , it should be added that the committee 's study , though in part concerned with the type of lobbying discussed by Senator McCarthy , is dealing with many other activities undertaken by individuals hired by foreign governments , some of which are not directly concerned with influencing Congress . Our study of these varied nondiplomatic activities does not aim to show they are necessarily wrong , but rather to obtain for the committee , the Senate and the American people a full and accurate picture of their actual nature and impact on U. S. policies . J. W. FULBRIGHT . Chairman , Committee on Foreign Relations , United States Senate . Washington , D. C. STATES AT WORK TO THE EDITOR : Recently in these columns , Prof. Andrew Hacker of Cornell attacked state legislatures as " disheartening , whether one 's concern is with democracy or efficiency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate President pro tern Walter J. Mahoney of New York State ( Aug. 19 ) , the professor retreats to a generalization that " the performance of states and their legislatures can only be measured against the growth and magnitude of the problem to be solved . " Personally , I doubt the soundness of basing so broad a conclusion on this single criterion . But even so , what have been the comparative total efforts of state and Federal Governments to meet the over-all problem ? Dollar-wise , the fact is that state expenditures have doubled every decade in this century except during the depression Nineteen Thirties , and , since 1940 , have grown more rapidly than non-defense Federal expenditures . Similarly , state personnel has about doubled since World War II ( 800.000 in 1946 vs. 1,600,000 in 1960 ) , whereas the number of civilian Federal employes has remained constant ( about 2,400,000 ) . Space does not permit answers to other arguments . In general , let me assure Professor Hacker , however , that state legislative programs are comprehensive , and dynamic , and seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service as chairman of a distinguished national committee which studied and reported at length on state legislative processes and procedures .
