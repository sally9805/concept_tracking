One of those far-out fantasies that have long been a staple of science fiction is now a serious subject for scientific discussion-with the Russians taking it to new extremes . Two unusual radio " stars , " wrote Astronomer Nikolai S. Kardashev in the Astronomical Journal of the Soviet Academy of Sciences , may be " supercivilizations " deep in space , calling attention to themselves by transmitting vast amounts of energy on peculiar , and therefore conspicuous , radio frequencies . <P> The two radio sources , catalogued as CTA-21 and CTA-102 , were first detected by radio astronomers in 1960 . Both are pinpoints in the sky , which means that they are either very small or very far away . But the most remarkable thing about them is the radio energy they emit : it is strongest at about 900 megacycles . This frequency , says Kardashev , is the best for longdistance space communication . <P> Spherical Shell . If the radio transmissions from CTA-21 and CTA-102 are actually attempts to communicate , they must come from supercivilizations with incredibly vast amounts of energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He points out that the total energy generated on earth is only about 4 billion kw , which is only a tiny fraction of the energy transmitted by the two radio sources . <P> The earth , he says , has only a crude " Type One " civilization . If its energy output continues to grow at 3% to 4% per year , in a few thousand years it will become a " Type Two " civilization producing 400,000 billion kw . This is just about the amount of energy given off by the sun . It might be generated handily , Kardashev thinks , by a civilization clever enough to rearrange the matter from its planets into a spherical shell around its central star . The outside of such an artifact would give no light , but conceivably it could be made to transmit an enormous amount of radio-frequency energy . <P> Type Three . Are Type Two civilizations the highest peaks that life can reach ? Not at all , says Kardashev . A properly ambitious form of superlife would not be satisfied with a single captive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galaxy containing billions of stars . Once it had control of an encapsulated galaxy , it would rank , says Kardashev , as a Type Three civilization and would probably try to communicate with other galaxies . <P> Many non-Soviet astronomers suspect that life may indeed be common in the universe , and if so , its higher centers may be trying to communicate with man 's young civilization on the earth , but few will accept Kardashev 's theory that CTA-21 and CTA-102 are actually stars hitched to radio transmitters . " Extremely unlikely " says U.S. Radio Astronomer Frank Drake of the National Radio Astronomy observatory in West Virginia . Drake admits that the signals from CTA-21 and CTA-102 are impossible to explain at present , but he does not consider them at all suitable for trans-space communication . For the present , he says , those signs must remain among the mysteries that abound in space .
