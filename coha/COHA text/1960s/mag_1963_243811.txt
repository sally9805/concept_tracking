There she sits , desperate , unhappy , twelve years old . She is cursed with the catastrophe of parents , and her boy friends complete her misery by being too young to drive . She sulks behind a screen of bob by pins , slapping at her baby fat , mourning the birth of her acne . She is a worried sixth-grader , an aging child , a frightened girl-and the queen of the $100 million-a-year popular record industry . <P> The record companies make market surveys , and as a result , they have through the years cast their heroine younger and younger , stretching her life cycle back toward the cradle . In the days when teenage girls were called bobby-soxers , a full-blooming record fan was 16 or so . and only by great leaps of the imagination could she convince herself that Frankie was really singing about her . Now she is ten , or even eight , and by twelve she has become an ardent collector of the dollar each . 45-r.p.m. records through which she suffers the painful joy of hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the singers and songwriters who churn out 5,000 records a year for her are scarcely older than she is. and they sing right at her . treating her as if she were a jaded old teenager . Every song echoes their search for something almost as grotesque as it sounds , something the industry calls " the teen feel . " <P> All Heart . Elusive and frail as a sparrow in the hands of any but the most mystically attuned writers and performers , the teen feel has inherited much of its style and sound from rhythm and blues , and much of its spirit from country music . But its creators consider it sharply distinct just the same . Country music , they say , comes from a hard , God-loving life in the sticks . Rhythm and blues comes from the soul . What remains in popular music is mainly the teen feel which , of course , is all heart . <P> The perfect teen-feel song has a melody simple enough for a devotee to learn in one hearing and , hopefully , it is also reminiscent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so ago . It has all the intellectual content of a scream , and its lyrics are direct and ungrammatical : <P> I 've waited so long for school to be through Paula , I ca n't wait no more for you . <P> Its rhymes are irresistibly convenient- " heart " and " apart , " ' ' take my hand " and " understand . " ' ' cruel " and " school . " The song can be about emotional cripples : <P> No one needs me , no one cares <P> No one wants me to be theirs . <P> Or economic cripples : <P> He does n't hang diamonds ' round my neck <P> An ' all he 's got 's an unemployment check . But it better be about cripples of some kind . Its themes run the full gamut of human feeling-from misery to self-pity to despair . When these subtleties have been achieved , the song ought to be recorded by someone who sings no better than any other kid on the block , lest the record lose the " dumb sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the girls . <P> Double Suicide . Occasionally , a happy song acquires a little reverse teen feel : <P> My name is Oliver Cool <P> I 'm the most swingingest boy in school , but the most trustworthy bets are exploration of the lower reaches of emotions .
