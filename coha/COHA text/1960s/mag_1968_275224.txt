E. W. Scripps Co. already owned the Cincinnati Post , but in 1956 it bought the Enquirer . Two years later , the company also acquired the Cincinnati Times-Star and merged it with the Post . Ever since , the chain has made every effort to show that the remaining two papers were competing as lustily as they ever had under separate ownership . The Enquirer had different management , did not receive Scripps-Howard features and editorials , did not even carry the chain 's lighthouse insigne . <P> Such separateness , however , was not enough to satisfy the U.S. Justice Department , which filed an antitrust suit in 1964 to force Scripps-Howard to give up the Enquirer . Justice thought it was confronted with a clear case of monopoly because the Enquirer was not a " failing " newspaper - was in no financial trouble- when Scripps took it over . After years of resisting , the chain finally gave up last week and entered a consent decree to sell its majority stock interest in the profitable paper .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
