" You may also see the equestrian portrait at close range whenever you like , " the King told her . " It has been brought to the Alcazarand it can easily be placed in this room or any other room where you may come to visit me . It is quite true that Velazquez has found favor with me  --  in fact , I may put it a little more strongly than that . I like him immensely as a man and I consider him more than capable of fulfilling the functions of Court Painter . So I have provided him with a studio and living quarters for his family here at the palace in order that he may have space for his work and facilities for doing it . Furthermore , I have just made him a Gentleman Usher of the Privy Chamber with a regular allowance as such  --  the same stipend that the barbers ' assistants receive  --  so that he may have ready access to me at any time . I will arrange to have you meet him if you like . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be much the same as mine and especially so in your case . I hope that the same will be true of the dishes I have chosen for our supper . Shall we sit down and see if they are ? " The girl showed no nervousness over being at table alone with the King . She served herself moderately but not sparingly from each of the rich dishes passed to her and ate with healthy appetite . She suffered her cup to be refilled when she had emptied it of wine and held it up to the light to admire the color of its contents . And while she ate and drank , she chatted , easily and pleasantly , as she had in the aposento , of her home and her family , her role in the current play , the future for which she hoped on the stage . The King found increasing satisfaction in listening to her musical voice and watchingher artless manner . When the last dish had been cleared away and the lackeys had left the room , she waited for some signal which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , as none came , unmindful of protocol , she asked a question without first having been addressed . " Is it Your Majesty 's wish that I should leave him now so that he may rest ? Or can I contribute to his pleasure in some way by staying a little longer ? " " My rest will come with you and through you , " he said slowly . " And you will contribute to my pleasure by staying . But I hope thisp101will not be merely a little longer . I hope it may be a good deal longer . " " I am at Your Majesty 's service . But I am afraid I do not wholly understand . " " I will explain to you . " It seemed impossible that she should be as completely lacking in experience as her words would indicate . Nevertheless , her guilelessnesshad the stamp of sincerity . He rose and came to her place at table , slipping an arm around her waist . She made no effort to withdraw from the caress , which at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the King drew her more closely to him and tightened his hold a little . She had immediately risen also and , though she looked at him questioningly , she smiled as she did so . She was a tall girl and he hardly needed to bend at all to bring his face close to hers . He kissed her gravely on the brow and then lightly on both cheeks before his lips strayed to her mouth . Even then , there had still been no insistence to their pressure when he asked her if what he did was offensive to her . " Your Majesty , how could it be ? " she asked . From the way she spoke , it was impossible to doubt that the question was one of complete simplicity , as it was one of complete candor . " Then may I proceed ? " he asked . " But , Sire , you must know the answer is yes . " At his request , she had come to the palace straight from the theater , still wearing the peasant costume in which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed lace-edged ruff around her graceful neck , above a rigid bodice tightly fastened with jeweled buttons , no vast farthingale secured around her waist . His kisses easily reached the breast he had bared by untying the single ribbon that fastened her loose white blouse and , as his hands strayed still further , he undid her full skirt with equal ease . Clad only in her shift , she was even lovelier than he had guessed . She stood very still , but if she felt either surprise or shame , she did not show it . Philip blew out the candles , leaving only the vigil light under the crucifix , and lifted her off her feet . She lay quietly in his arms as he crossed the narrow strip of carpet between the table and the bed.  | " The kisses were very sweet , but I find they do not suffice , " he said as he put her down on it . He had never thought they would and , surely , this girl could not have thought so , either . She must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to her , but she still showed no signs of either fright or revulsion , and lay , silent and quiescent , where he had placed her , as if waiting , without anxiety , whatever he might next require of her . After all , she was a public entertainer , a girl of the people , who had come willingly enough from a small provincial village to become an actress in Madrid ; to all intents and purposes , that meant becoming a courtesan as well . His conscience did not disturb him with its still small voice , as it sometimes did when he was preparing to seduce a lady of quality , presumably virtuous ; he had never been so quickly kindled to urgency and he was conscious of no compulsion to repress this . Yet , he had hardly begun his eager trespass when he was halted by a strange misgiving . " Surely , you are not a virgin ! " he said , almost harshly . " I believe Your Majesty has just realized that I am , " she whispered . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Does that make any difference , Sire ? " " Of course , " he said , more harshly . " It makes you doubly desirableand should make you doubly invulnerable . . . not that it will , " he added vehemently after a moment . " You are everything that I have long sought in vain and I would be less than human if I renounced you now . Then , afterward , I shall reproach myself . " " Your Majesty will reproach himself ! For deigning to accept the only gift at my disposal ? " Suddenly he understood . She was trying to tell him not only that she believed he had a royal right to her maidenhood , but that she was joyous in being able to offer it to him . He was infinitely moved , but at the same time that his heart was touched , his senses were spurred ; and , though he meant to be gentle , desire had become a driving force , consummation a crying need . Even so , with possessioncame tenderness and concern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did not want to . And I know I have . But you yielded so quickly and so completely  --  " " Was it not meet that I should , Sire , since you are my king ? "  | " I would rather it had been because you knew me for your true love . " " Then let me dare to say it was for that reason , too . I have loved Your Majesty from the first moment I saw him . " " As I have you , dear heart . " He drew her to him again , this time with gentleness and , after he had embraced her once more , she went to sleep in his arms . He lay awake for a long time , delighting in her and cherishing her . Then he , too , fell asleep and his slumber was peaceful and profound.  |p104IF  he could have had his way with her in everything , as he could and did in their lovemaking , he would have insisted on her retirement from the stage . But on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just as he was a king ; they must both do their appointed work ; and she was so insistent about it that he actually attended to his royal duties with more industry and energy than ever before , and spent more time in the open air , so that he might be physically fit to meet his mental obligations . He had always been a superb horseman , but he had insisted that , since the Conde-Duque was rightly regarded as the greatest in the kingdom , he had not been inclined to dispute this title ; now it intrigued him to do so , at the same moment that he took over more of his Minister'swork . This gave only tempered satisfaction to Olivares , who was afraid that , at this rate , control of the kingdom might slip from his own grasp ; in providing a new attraction , his purpose had been entirely different . The Queen , too , fretted because the King did not join her in more of the pastimes devised for them ; she pouted a little . It seemed he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day passed that Philip was not in Diego 's studio at the palace , taking his ease in a great leather armchair and watching the process of covering huge bare canvases with color . If the King had time for that , the Queen insisted , he should also have more time for balls , for torchlight parades , for equestrian shows . Even the theater did not seem to interest him as much as it once had . The latest complaint was certainly made tongue in cheek . What the Queen really meant was that her husband did not frequent the private performances at the palace and that he seldom went to thep105Corral de la Pacheca any more . On the other hand , he never failed to be in his aposento at the Corral de la Cruz when la Calderona was playing there . If the Queen did not mention the further fact that la Calderona nearly always came to the palace to sup with the King after a performance , it was not because she ignored this . It was partly because , like everyone else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since it had had the effect of weaning him away from more questionable associations ; and it was partly because , on the one occasion when she had given public evidence of her resentment , her impetuous action had proved a boomerang : Ines had taken her place on a balcony to view a spectacle in the Plaza Mayor , given to celebrate the feast day of St. Peter and St. Paul , at almost the same moment that the Queen had taken hers on her own balcony and the attention of the populace had immediately been diverted from the royal family to the royal favorite . This was the first time 1a Calderona had appeared in public , except when she herself was acting , since the King 's attentions to her had become common knowledge and she was the object of tremendous friendly curiosity to the people who considered the product of a small village as one of their own and had taken pride in her achievements as an actress . Isabel , piqued by the enthusiastic demonstration of the populace , rashly decided that this should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the limelight would be stolen from the Queen and ordered that the opposite balcony should be vacated . This was promptly and quietly done and she felt she had scored a triumph  --  after suffering such a public rebuke , la Calderona would certainly not risk a second one . But Isabel had reckoned without her host . Fiestas came frequently on the calendar and the next , in honor of Santa Ana 's feast day , was one of exceptionally great gala . The Plaza Mayor was as sumptuously adorned as it had been in honor of the Prince of Wales , its hundreds of balconies hung with crimson and gold . All the stands , erected especially for the occasion , were filled with spectators in merrymaking mood and all the balconies crowded with more privileged onlookers ; a latecomer would have found it impossible to get space anywhere , though there were more than six hundred available windows in the tall buildings that framed the plaza and fifty thousand persons could be crowded into its openp106area . For the occupation of the royal family , the plaza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was the Casa Panaderia , a four-story , red brick building with twin towersat either end , arcades on the ground floor and row after row of railed balconies above these . On the opposite side of the plaza , before the Portal of the Paneros , had been prepared the dais for the Council of Castile  --  the only group entitled to be seated face to face with His Majesty . This was also according to custom and caused no surprise . But the gaze of the multitude was soon diverted from Royalty and Council to a house on the corner of the Calle de los Boteros , which had a uniquely blank facade . As far as anyone could remember , this house was the only one on the plaza which had never had a balcony . What could have happened to it ? Certainly it had one now and , moreover , this balcony was the most richly adorned of all . It was empty and the people , almost with one accord , stared at it in fascination , waiting to see who would occupy it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped out on it and graciously acknowledged the plaudits with which she was greeted , the enthusiasmof the crowd became uproarious . This time , it was the Queen who left the plaza before the spectacle had begun . That night , she did something she had not done since they were still children , playing at love ; she came on her own initiative to the King 's apartments and , finding them empty , as she expected , save for the Gentlemen of the Bedchamber in the anteroom , awaited his return and confronted him with fury : he had insulted her publicly and all for a cheap little actress who did not even have the decency to refuse herself to other lovers . If he would go to la Calderona 's house , unannounced , instead of always having her brought to the palace ... . " I have just come from her house , " Philip answered , interruptingthe outburst . He spoke with his usual calmness , but it was evidentto Isabel that he , too , was very angry . " It may interest you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive an ultimatum . She did not accept my invitation to supper tonight , not because she wanted to receive another lover , but because she wanted to tell me that she would never again consent to appear at a public spectacle , except on the stage when she herself was playing a part . She told me she wasp107very much ashamed because of the balcony scene this evening . I remindedher that there would have been no such scene had it not been for the one that occurred on the feast of St. Peter and St. Paul , for which you were responsible  --  indeed , there would not have been a balcony hastily constructed on a blank facade . She insisted that was entirely different , that you were quite justified in asking her to leave the Plaza Mayor , if her presence there were displeasing to you , though she had not thought it would be , when she went there in a wholly private capacity , so to speak . She had not realized that the people already recognized her as my mistress and that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she does realize it and , unless I consent to her conditions , she will decline to visit me in the future . " " You may be very sure that if she does that , it will not be because she is ashamed of what happened today , but because she is looking for a pretext to have more free time for another lover . " The King shrugged his shoulders . " If you are talking about Medina de las Torres , " he said , this time speaking coldly as well as calmly , " it may interest you to know that I threw him out of her house , very early in my association with her  --  apparently with her entire approval . As it happens , the first time I invited her to have supper with me  --  which was also the first night I saw her  --  she asked to be excused on account of a previous engagement . It was , of course , a very naive thing to do  --  she did not realize an actress does not properly decline an invitation from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found this naivete rather refreshing  --  it is certainlyrare . She did not mention the name of her prospective host , but of course I took prompt steps to find out who it was and , yes , you are quite right , it was Medina de las Torres . Unquestionably , he made advances to her that night , but also , unquestionably , they were unsuccessful . " " What makes you so sure ? " " Because the next night she came to me and  --  I confess , to my great surprise  --  I found that she was still a virgin . I assume you do not need to have me explain to you , in detail , how I know this . " " No , " Isabel said contemptuously . " I realize that you are an expert in such matters . And I admit that she played her cards veryp108well on that occasion . But this was four months ago . Since then  --  " " Since then , she has visited me almost every evening . And on the few evenings when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have missed her so much that I have usually gone to her house , and always without telling her beforehand whether or not I intended to do so . It was on one of these occasions that I threw out Medina de las Torres . Although I did not actually injure him , much as I was tempted to do so , I acted with such force that I do not think he will be tempted to repeat the experiment , even if he were in a position to try . As it is , he is not , for I have given him formal permission to leave Madrid for an indefinite period . Moreover , I have now installed my old nurse , Ana de Guevara , in the house on the Calle de los Boteros and I feel reasonably sure that in the future Ines will be free from intrusion . " " I am surprised that the Conde-Duque permits such an appointment . After all , it was he who was responsible for poor Ana 's banishmentfrom the palace . " " I will explain to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was a child , that I feel the time has now come for her quiet reinstatement in a new capacity . This is not an official appointment , but a wholly domestic arrangement . And , since his son-in-law is responsible for its necessity , I do not believe he will feel inclined to find much fault with it . After all , he is a reasonable man . I wish I could say as much for you as a woman . " The King had remained standing throughout his conversation with his wife . Now he glanced casually at the clock and bowed . " It is rather late , " he remarked . " Will you permit me to escort you back to your own apartments ? I am afraid you must be very tired . You are not usually so ill tempered or so lacking in dignity . Tomorrow the scene at the Plaza Mayor will be almost the sole subject of gossip on all the Liars ' Walks and every pamphleteer and ballad-monger will be hard at work . You have injured your position and mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was most unbecoming . Can you imagine , for a moment , that under similar circumstances your mother would have retreated before Gabrielle d'Estree ? Of course not ! Perhaps you are not only exhausted butp109ill . I hope that you will feel better after a good night 's rest . If not , I shall insist on summoning a physician . " Ines was as good as her word : she never again appeared in publicexcept as an actress ; and , viewed by the standards of the day , she was a model of decorum . She went regularly to rehearsals , she was courteous to her fellow players and did not give them the impression that she thought royal favor had taken her out of their milieu . She filled every theatrical part for which she was cast with ease and grace and occasionally invited other members of the company to her house and accepted invitations from them for the early evening . But at the end of each performance , she slipped quietly away to the room where she knew the King would be waiting for her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summoned them ; he liked to be alone when he greeted Ines and this he always did with tenderness and affection . In leisurely companionship , they told each other everything that had happened since they had last parted . It was not until he rang that anyone intruded on their happy solitude a deux ; and though the service given them was perfect in all its details , it was not prolonged . Then , after supper was finished , by common consent and with no discussion of something that should be taken for granted , they made love and went to sleep in each other'sarms . Philip had wanted to install Ines in an elegant apartment with attendants and furnishings of her own ; and she had declined to considerthis , just as she had declined to give up acting and to receive costly presents . The room which the King had chosen for their first assignation was the one to which she wanted to return , night after night , the only one she wanted set aside for her use . And what would she do with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself ? It was fitting , of course , for his safety , that the King should be escorted when he came to her and when he left her for the state apartments of the Alcazar ; nor did it disturb her to know that his attendants on these occasions were well aware of what was happeningbeyond the doors that were closed to them . It was also fitting that the King should have his cupbearer at his side while he supped ,  |p110that  everything about his table should be in accordance with his rank . But these accouterments were for him and not for her . She wanted from him nothing that he could give her except himself . And , as far as it was in him to give to anyone , he gave to her . As a solemn and lonely boy , he had wholeheartedly welcomed the gay companionship of a lively , attractive young girl ; his life had been immeasurably brightened by Isabel 's vivacity and , as far as it was possible for him to fall in love at such an early age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primarily on adolescent impulse heightened by propinquity ; he did not miss her greatly when he was separated from her , as on his recent sojourn in the provinces . His feeling for her had not always been strong enough to sublimate jealousy and anger . Though it had never occurred to him or anyone else , including the Queen , that he would be faithful to his marriagevows , while he exacted such faithfulness from her , the affairs in which he had so far indulged had been only passing fancies , the subject of tittle-tattle , but not really troublesome in any way , least of all to the King 's peace of mind . Now , for the first time , as a grown man , he loved deeply and passionately ; and the knowledge that his love was returned in full measure , without self-interest or self-seeking , intensified his ardor and his devotion . If Ines had been willing to accept a half of his kingdom , he would have joyfully given it to her . But she had spoken the truth : it was the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their first raptures , they were heedless of the probability that their passion would be productive ; and when a year had passed without such results , though they no longer ignored it as an eventuality , it did not trouble them . If , during all these months when the King had come to her night after night , Ines had not conceived , surely she would never do so ! Then one evening she fainted dead away in the middle of a performance and , though she revived quickly and insisted on going on to the end , receiving tremendous applause for her courage , malicious whispers were mingled with the expressions of sympathy and admiration . The King who , as usual , was present at the theater when she acted , was deeply concerned ; but she succeeded in soothing him before he left her at dawn the next morning . It was nothing , she insisted , except the unseasonablep111heat , bad enough everywhere in the city , almost insufferable in the wings of the theater . However , when she swooned again , this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airy room which they shared and the King himself was the one who restored her to consciousness , his anxiety was not so easily assuaged . As he laid his hand over her heart , to assure himself of its steady beating , he noticed a change in her bosom . Her breasts were beautifully formed and very soft , but they had been small ; after all , she was still very young . Now , unless the flickering candlelight and his own sense of touch were playing tricks , they had become larger and firmer . He had not forgotten the first time he had noticed a similar change in the Queen , when he was only a boy of fifteen . He and Isabel had jested about it , as they did about everything at the beginning of that unfortunate pregnancy , which had ended with the prematurebirth of their first daughter . They had thought that the first change in her person and those that followed it were all very amusing . But Philip was not amused now . " My darling , is there something you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  presently . It was too soon for me to be sure . " " Too soon ? " He looked at her questioningly and put his hand over her heart again . She took it in both of hers and raised it to her lips . " We can still have some months of happiness together if that is my true love 's wish . And then I shall go back to my own pueblo and the public here will forget me . " " I doubt if the public will ever forget you . Certainly your true love will not . But then there will be no chance to forget , for I shall not permit you to leave me . The stage , yes , that you must do at once . But you will leave it for the palace . So far , I have bowed to your wish that you should have no attendants , that this one room should serve as your bower . You shall keep this , because you have become attached to it  --  as I have because it was here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the many times since then that we have been rapturously together . But there are other rooms leading out of it which must be made into a suite for your greater ease and comfort ; you will now spend all your time here . And , of course , there mustp112be suitable attendants to wait on you  --  women of mature years , kindly and competent . When do you think this child of ours will be born ? " " Not before mid-April , Sire . And I could well continue to act until after the New Year . " " As far as your figure is concerned , very likely . But I can not have you taking chances with your health . It is too precious to me . " " Will you not make a bargain with me , Sire , and agree that if there is no more swooning , I may act through the festivals of the Navidad ? I have heard that often these fainting fits come only early in this period of expectancy , as does sometimes a distaste for food and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Your Majesty will agree to what I ask , I will agree to come to the palace and stay  --  until after the child is born . Is that not a fair bar-gain ? " He hesitated , but she now had her arms around his neck and was drawing him down closer to her . The candlelight was not so flickering that it failed to disclose her loveliness as she lay there  --  the loveliness which had seemed to increase , night by night , and which had never been as irresistible as it was now . When his lips met hers , he consented to do what she asked . FROM that time on , her health remained radiant and her farewell performance was a triumph . There was a gala banquet after it , attended by numerous grandees ; toasts were drunk , gifts exchanged and many laudatory references made to la Calderona 's great talents as an actress , and to the loss which the theater would sustain in her " temporary " absence , because she had given so much to her art that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So much to her art ! Rather so much to the King ! " ran some of the whispers . " And it is to be hoped that he will now let her rest  --  or there will be another stillborn premature child , or one that is malformed and diseased . " . . . " No , no ! " came the vehement answer . " This child will not be born before term , whenever that is , nor will it be malformed or diseased . Granted that it was conceived in sin ; it was not conceived within the bonds of consanguinity , forbiddenexcept by special dispensation . And its mother is not a delicateprincess , but a healthy girl of the people , albeit , she can put most Court beauties to shame by her looks . She will bear her child easily and it will have her health and her looks and it will be a boy . The King will have a son at last . " . . . " But not , alas ! an heir . " .. . " Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juan of Austria his heir . But he made him the greatest prince in the world and that prince made himself the greatest hero of the age at Le-panto ! " ) The gossips who whispered , first at the banquet and later on the Liars ' Walks , continued to dispute and to prophesy and the King and his love knew of this , but it did not disturb them overmuch . Their affair had attained an idyllic quality . Heavy doors had beenp114opened out on either side of the great room which had been their first trysting place and where stood the curtained bed to which the King still came as often as ever , though now it was with passion restrained by tenderness , for never would he let his sweetheart feel that he had failed her in this when she most needed it . On one side of this room was the one where now slept the two women whom the King had chosen to care for Ines  --  a room less sumptuous than hers , but still with everything needed for comfort ; it had seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the palace and Philip had left the selection of his old nurse 's companion to her discretion ; on the other side was the room where Philip and Ines now sat to dine and which he had caused to be richly adorned . Its floor was covered with rare rugs and its windows were hung with rich draperies . Among the tapestries on the walls were great mirrors and a new painting by another young aspiring artist named Alonso Cano , which the King had prevailed upon Ines to accept as a gift because it was such a gentle and touching representation of her patron saint . There was always a fire burning on the great hearthstone through the winter evenings , and its glancing light fell on the tapestriesand the picture and the polychrome statues that the King had brought there for the room 's greater embellishment , as well as on the King and his love as they sat at meat , or at chess , or side by side while one sang to the other and the one who was not singing strummed some instrument . The King himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballad maker and sonneteer ; and after he had first composed the verses , he then sang songs to his own accompaniment on a guitar or a lute . And la Calderona learned all the words he wrote , so that sometimes she sang to him , instead of he to her , and sometimes they sang together in a harmonious duet . She encouraged him to develop his obvious but neglected talents , to take them more seriously . At first , he laughed at her . Since he knew he could not write satires like Quevedo , sonnets like G6ngoraor plays like Calderon de la Barca and Lope de Vega , to mentiononly a few of those he had gathered around him , what was the use of trying ? It was not primarily competition she was urging , Ines said ; itp115was creation  --  though , as far- as that went , certainly there was no reason why he should not match his wit against others in the-LiteraryAcademies and the Floral Games then so greatly in vogue . At all events , it would please her very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other spur after this simple statement ; and the ballads which he brought her , before offering them to select groups , won prizes , not because he was the King , but because she had inspired him to write real poetry . As they spoke more and more of his talents , they spoke less and less of hers , for Ines did not refer , of her own accord , to a resumptionof her theatrical career ; and though she made her former companionswelcome when they came to see her , she was not the one to suggest that they should do this . So , gradually , they came less and less , for they understood that she was content to be alone , except when the King could be with her , and that her heart was so wholly his that she could no longer share it easily with anyone else . When she walked abroad , as she did every day at dusk , for air and exercise , enveloped in a great fur-lined velvet cloak , which shielded her from the cold and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tirewomenwent with her and she kept either to the secluded gardens in the palace grounds or to one of the less frequented walks near by . Even in a city where assault and robbery were matters of such commonoccurrence that they caused little or no comment , she was safe ; she was known by sight to everyone and beloved by all , except those who were jealous of her ; and the few who did not wish her well would not have dared to lay a finger on the prospective mother of the King 's child . The baby , as she had expected , was born at mid-April -- - " the most beautiful and perfect child that ever was seen "  --  and taken , richly robed , when he was four days old , to the parochial Church of San Justo y Pastor for his baptism . His godfather was Don Melchor de Vera , Gentleman of the Bedchamber to the King , who had been the first to escort Ines to the palace and who had been her firm and faithful friend ever since . And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his mother 's room by the King himself . It would have been contrary to etiquette for him to appear at the baptism , even of a legal heir ; but he had managed to flout protocolp116by observing everything from a closely curtained pew , which he reached from an adjoining house . And now , holding the child in his arms , he described its exemplary behavior in glowing terms and acknowledged that he had insisted on giving it the name of his greatuncle . " The second Don Juan of Austria will become even more famousthan the first , " he told Ines . " Everyone already recognizes him as my son , but this recognition will be formalized in due course of time . He shall be brought up in royal state , which he will adorn . " The King looked fondly down at the beautiful baby , who was beginning to show signs of restlessness and then , handling him with the inexpertness typical of all males , brought him to the bed and laid him down beside his mother . " As you will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fasten in place a magnificent necklace . " Sire , it was agreed that I should accept no gifts , " she said quietly . She did not try to remove the necklace , as both hands were occupied with the baby ; but something in her tone told the King that , as soon as she could release herself , she would undo the diamondclasp and let the jeweled chain fall in a glittering heap on her bedside table . There was the same finality about her tone that had been there when he had first tried to persuade her to give up acting and live entirely on his bounty and for their joint pleasure . " Yes , but did n't that agreement come to an end when I gave you this ? " he asked , pointing to the baby , who was now nursing greedily . " Because you gave me this , there is all the more reason why our agreement should hold . It is enough for me to have borne the child of the greatest monarch on earth . " " Dear love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You areconfusing generations . That was the father of the other Don Juan . " " You are perhaps not as great as he in some respects , " she saidcalmly , as if quite willing to concede the point . " But you are stillthe greatest one on earth today . You are not only a patron of thearts which have so flourished under your leadership that Spain hasattained a preeminent place in the world of culture . You are yourself a painter , a poet and a musician of impeccable taste and exceptionaltalent . Of what other king can you say as much ? Louis ofp117France ? Charles of England ? Sire , you are pleased to jest . And this is no moment for jesting . It is a moment for sober speech . When you spoke of bringing up our child in royal state , just what did you mean by that ? Where is this royal state to be kept ? " " Why here ! With you at its head . " " Sire , you know that can not be . You have a wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by what I give to you . She will only resemblemore closely the queens of her own country who accept , without question , the mattresses en titre of their husbands . I am planning that the same arrangement , the same recognition shall take place here . Why should the King of Spain relegate his true love to the place of light-o ' - love while the King of France glorifies his ? " " Is it real glory , Sire ? Or does it have the glitter of false gold ? My glory is that I have been your love , your true love , as you have been mine . But it has been a sinful love , for you are the husband of another woman and I am not your wife , but your mistress . " " More dearly loved than any wife could ever be . Will you not grant that , since kings are not free to choose their wives , they should at least be free to choose their loves and that , without remorse ? " " I wish that I could say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he saw that her eyes were filled with tears and , when he would have kissed them away , she turned her head so that he could not do so . " It has been a joyous love , but a sinful one , as I said before , " she repeated . " And now that it has been crowned by this gift of a fair son , it must end . As soon as provision can be made for our child , so that he will not miss his mother too much , I must beg your leave to go . " " To go ! To go where ? " " I had thought of the Badiel Valley . In it there is a little villagecalled Valfermoso da las Monj as and near by a convent of the same name , where I would be made welcome . My mother has a kinswomanin the Community . " " Valfermoso de las Monjas ! A hamlet in a deep valley of the Alcarria Range ! A region of moor and of scrub and of little else besides ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a cloisteredlife in a place like that ! "  | " Yes , Sire , I not only would , I shall . " Before he could move swiftly enough to stop her , she had put down the baby , now peacefully sleeping , removed the necklace and slipped from the bed to her knees before him . " Sire , permit the mother of your son to go and sin no more . Let her devote the remainder of her life to cloistered sanctity . Is this too great a boon for her to ask of her King ? That she should spend her days in prayer for divine pardon  --  for herself , but most of all for him ? " " I will not suffer you to kneel to me , Ines . Neither will I sufferyou to leave me . " For the first time , he spoke to her sternly . But she was strongly built and , though childbirth was still but a few days behind her , she was able to resist him when he tried to raise her to her feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . " Sire , I have heard it said that the Queen again has hopes of a child . You have not been with me so constantly that you have forgottenyour duty toward her and to the kingdom . I believe the rumorsare true and that , this time , if she receives the same loving care that I have had , she may bring forth a healthy child . And I pray that it may be a son  --  a son truly entitled to every prerogative of the throne . And when this happens , I , in my quiet convent , will lead the prayers of thanksgiving . " For a full hour , they strove against each other in both speech and action . Then the child began to whimper and both knew that the strife between them must end so that she could suckle him again . There was something about her , as she lay down again , with the baby at her breast , that reminded the King of the first time he had seen her lying in that same bed , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was not about to claim a courtesan , but to ravish a virgin . He had been halted then , though not to the extent of leaving her inviolate , at least to the extent of trying to treat her , however unsuccessfully , with the same tenderness , the same effort toward gentleness , that he would have shown a lawfulbride . Now he was halted further still . Though he had been astonished at her vigor , the fact remained that it was only a few days since her travail ; he could not take her , when she was hardlyp11*9past parturition , when she had not yet been churched  --  decency , as well as compassion , forbade it . And yet he knew , as he looked down on her , that if he did not possess her then , she would never be at his mercy again . She would first evade him and then escape him ; she would go to her lonely convent in its desolate valley , to lead a life of poverty , chastity and obedience , in remission of sins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kissed her once  --  Ines and the child asleep beside her . Then he left her , gatheringup the spurned necklace as he did so.  |p120THE  birth of her only son , Baltasar Carlos , nine years after the consummation of her marriage and after the loss , almost every year , of a baby girl , completely changed the tenor of Isabel de Bourbon 's life . The sarcasms of the Conde-Duque , regarding the sole usefulnessof women , were stilled forever , as far as she was concerned ; if she had been less successful in dealing with the Condesa 's persistentlyarrogant attitude , she could afford to disregard it ; she also could afford to dismiss from her mind all resentment of the other baby boy , six months older than her own , now entrusted to the watchful care of reliable but alien guardians at Ocana , while his mother served her sacrificial novitiate in a remote convent of the Badiel Valley . Since la Calderona 's insistent withdrawal , Philip had treated Isabel with the greatest tenderness and consideration ; and though she was well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not due entirely to her condition , she felt equally sure that there had been no successor to the actress in his affections and she doubted if there ever would be . For the time being , the King , who had sustained a severe shock in the loss of his " true love , " was still stunned by it ; and though , later on , there would be transient affairs again , these were inevitable , given his temperament and training ; and Isabel could accept those philosophically , as long as no deep abiding emotion was involved . Actually , Ines had unsuspectingly imposed a new restraint on the King by her willful retirement ; this had been so highly regarded as showing delicate feeling that it was now tacitly understood a convent must be the proper and logical sequel after a liaison with the King , thatp126he must never have a successor in a subject 's affections ; and more than one young lady had taken to locking her door on the mere suspicion that Philip was casting amorous glances in her direction . One rebel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sire ! I do n't want to be a nun ! " and , as she was overheard , there had been some unseemly jests on the subject . Philip 's sense of humor , never very keen , had not been strong enough to dismiss these jests lightly . Isabel was amused as well as gratified by them . Even though the secondary purpose of her marriage  --  a guaranteeof friendship between her native country and her adopted country  --  had not been fulfilled , her failure in Spain had been no greater than her sister-in-law 's in France and this was a source of some consolation : the Infanta Ana 's marriage to Louis XIII had been expected to achieve the same results as Isabel de Bourbon 's to Philip IV and these had been circumvented by Richelieu just as successfullyas hers by Olivares . Besides , her French origin had long since been forgiven and , indeed , by many almost forgotten , since she had proved herself , in so many ways , essentially a Spaniard . She had been popular from the beginning , beloved since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Hapsburgs were almostincessantly waging against their numerous enemies . Now that she had provided an heir to the throne , she was acclaimed . Her birthday , which marked her first public appearance after her confinement , was made the occasion of unprecedented celebrations in her honor ; and an open area , which had just been transformed , seemingly almost by magic , into a royal seat and given the name of the Buen Retiro , made an ideal setting for these . Olivares was responsible for this remarkable transformation and was justly proud of the ingenuity and speed with which his project had been carried out . Always on the alert , as far as the King 's temperament and tastes were concerned , he had long been aware that the grim old Alcazar , on the cliff overlooking the Manzanares , had never appealed to Philip as the setting for his frivolities ; though his idyll with la Calderona had marked a happy interlude , he was more and more inclined , as time went on , to regard this royal palace as a place where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and where he had been obliged to take over the heavy burdenp127of government at the age of sixteen , quite unprepared to deal with such a hive of intrigue , hate and jealousy . The Escorial was equally distasteful to him ; as far as he was concerned , it was primarily a mausoleum , not a pleasance . Aranjuez , he enjoyed , but that had been pronounced insalubrious , except in the springtime ; and though the reason for this was not clear to him , he accepted it , as he did other vague pronouncements , rather than taking the trouble of investigatingor denying them . He enjoyed the Pardo , where he had merrily begun his wedded life , and the Casa de Campo , sometimes the scene of less legitimate pleasures ; but , after all , those were hardly more pretentious than hunting lodges and were intended to be used chiefly as such . Conscious of all this , Olivares decided that the situation warranteda fifth royal residence in the Madrid area ; and , fortunately , the extensive and beautiful grounds , attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his purposes , as was the monastery 's suite of apartments which was set aside for occupancy by the royal family during periods of retreat or mourning . There was no reason why this suite should not be enlarged and redecoratedfor more permanent residence  --  why , indeed , a separate building should not be provided for the King 's accommodation  --  why a few fountains and summerhouses should not be added to the general decor . And , presently , there was another palace , this one bright , elegant and airy , and a series of groves and gardens , all in a setting of lakes and cascades . For a surprisingly long time , Olivares had managed to keep his vast plan a secret from the King by seeing that His Majesty was diverted elsewhere ; and when the final results of his project were revealed , in all their imaginative taste and magnitude , the King was unstinted in his praise of his chamberlain 's achievements . A ceremonious inaugural took place , at which Olivares  --  the self-constituted Honorary Constable of the palace  --  knelt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salver and the King returned them with an affectionate salute . Thereafter , came a series of gorgeous entertainments  --  cane tourneys , bullfights , balls , masques  --  which delighted the Queen as much as they did the King . Therefore , the celebration of her birthday furnished a welcome pretext to prolong and repeat these.  |p128The  baptism of the heir to the throne was an event of even greater seasonal importance ; and the new Queen of Hungaryacted as sponsor for Baltasar Carlos at his christening , which was even more splendid than those of his poor little short-lived sisters . She welcomed this opportunity to shine in reflected glory . Earlier that year , when she was still only the Infanta Maria , she had been married , by proxy , to the Emperor 's heir , Ferdinand Ernest , and , as Philip was ill at the time , the wedding had taken place in his apartments , with the Queen and the Infantes Carlos and Fernandoas almost the only other witnesses . Throughout the ceremony , the King had reclined on his bed , clad in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestive of proper preparations for a bridal , were the flowered carpets which had been laid , the silken curtains which had been hung and a couple of new mirrors . Maria was aggrieved and complained to Isabel , who was still her best-belovedconfidante ; they agreed that the Conde-Duque was probably to blame , though it was not apparent that they had any sound reason for this ; and a further source of grievance was provided by the delay in arranging for a suitable escort to take the new queen to her husband 's home . However , just before the birth of Baltasar Carlos , a special envoy from the Emperor arrived in the person of Prince Guastalla , who brought with him gifts for the bride , valued at more than three hundred thousand ducats , and an urgent summonsfor her to start on her way at once . Five years had now elapsed since she took a fond farewell of the Prince of Wales and he had already married Henriette Marie of France , the sister of Louis XIII . She had been sure for a long while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit that it had only been badly wounded and she was not yet wise enough to know that she could not escape the common lot of carrying the scars made by a wound from first love to her grave . She had been " docile " when the new match was proposed to her , though she was , not unnaturally , inclined to regard her second suitor as a laggard in love , when she contrasted his wooing with the first 's , and to feel the lack of tender messages and small keepsakes ; but she was placated with the prospect of a royal progress in the immediate future and her eventual position as Empress of the Holy Roman Empire , whichp129would carry with it far more glamour and prestige than the position of Queen Consort of England . Moreover , the company of her three brothers , who all went with her as far as Zaragoza , leaving Isabel to act as Regent again , served as a very effective solace for the time being . The rest of her journey , made under the supervision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter soon set in and there was a long delay before she could proceed any further than Italy . Isabel , reading the homesick letters that came to her by courier , was sincerely sorry for her sister-in-law ; but the days when she could do anything to help Maria were gone forever . Nothing united their lives any longer and hers was rewarding and complete , now that she had borne a son and he was hale and hearty . She might well have said of him , as was said of One much greater , that he " increasedin wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man . " When Baltasar Carlos was two years old , he was taken to the Church of San Jeronimo , where a magnificent staging had been erected before the high altar , to receive , as heir to the throne , the oaths of the Castilian Cortes . Clad in crimson and gold and equipped with a miniature sword and dagger , both diamond studded , he was escorted to the staging by his two uncles , whose leading strings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strutted proudly along by himself and the assembled grandees , who had been quarreling among themselves about precedence only a few minutesearlier , were silenced with pride and pleasure , as they watched his smiling and sturdy progress . Tragically , this proved to be the last time that the two attractiveyoung Infantes appeared at a public function with their promisinglittle nephew . Shortly thereafter , they accompanied the King to Barcelona , where he went to convoke the Cortes of Cataluna , while Isabel once more assumed the role of Regent . The childhooddevotion between them and Philip had never lessened , but neither had ever shared his faith in Olivares . As in the case of the Queen , the Conde-Duque would have been wiser to allow them at least a nominal voice in public affairs ; denied this , their idleness was an invitation to dissipation , and they made powerful friends among his antagonists , including the Admiral of Castile and his kinsman , Don Alfonso de Moscoso . Olivares , in turn , resented both the fam/ily solidarity and the intimacies elsewhere ; all were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had dwelt on the possibility of sending Fernando to Flanders as the King 's representative ; their aunt , the Infanta Clara Eugenia , who had been appointed its governorby Philip II , was now a very old lady , and it was advisable to provide for the contingency of her death at any time . By continuing the policy of Philip III and allowing their nominal subjects , the Dutch Protestants , to live independently from the rest of Flanders , she and her husband , the Archduke Albert , had managed to enjoy peace for a long while ; but now the normally stolid Dutch , in a fighting mood , opposed the renewal of their former allegiance , which the Conde-Duque was trying to enforce . Everyone agreed that Brussels , the Flemish capital , must have a member of the royal Hapsburg family in residence , but the choice of the youthful cardinalfor this important post was less logical , and his departure had been postponed for one reason after another , lack of funds among them . Much as Fernando wanted to go , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had plucked up courage to object . There was no jealousy between the brothers , but he was the elder of the two ; moreover , he was a " man of arms , " while Fernando was a " churchman " ; the latter pleasantly agreed to step aside in favor of primogenitureand profession . This did not solve the problem for Olivares , however . Carlos was next in line as heir to the throne , after Baltasar , the Conde-Duque reminded him smoothly , and the child did not seem as well as usual . It was not fitting that the Infanteshould go far away just then for any length of time , especially as they were also trying to find a suitable princess for him to marry . Later on , he would be given the command in Portugal , which was much more important than command in Flanders . Or , possibly , in Cataluna . Therefore , such a trip as the King was about to make would be just the thing to prepare him for his future responsibilities . Carlos took very little stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Baltasar Carlos was in robust health ; and he and everyone else had abandoned hope of finding exactly the right princess for his own bride . But he was both too amiable and too indolent for further argument and , as long as his seniority was at least theoretically rec/ognized , he was willing to let matters drift . So was Olivares ; he knew that Carlos would cease to present a problem in Madrid if Fernando were elsewhere and , for the time being , why not dispose of the troublemaker by keeping him in Barcelona ? It would not cost much to get him there , in the King 's retinue , and the wealthy Catalans could well afford to support a viceroy . The appointment in Flanders could still be dangled before Carlos . Fernando was , indeed , less amenable to unquestioning controlthan his elder brother and , when he learned that his personal household had been ordered to precede him to Barcelona , he went raging to the Queen , in whom he knew he would find a willing listener to his grievances . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence , since he would be allowed no voice in what happened , was just a ruse to get him out of Madrid and sidetrack him from the governorship of Flanders , despite the fact that , for six years , he had been led to believe the Conde-Duque , who had now apparently changed his mind , had destined him for that post . He had been glad to defer to Carlos , as long as there was any chance that the latter might have the coveted position ; but it was now clear that the Conde-Duque did not intend to let him get it and , evidently , he was not being considered seriously for Cataluna , either , for , if so , why these preparations to keep him , Fernando , there ? Isabel listened with rapt attention . " I 'm very much afraid you are right , " she said . " I have seen a letter that Olivares wrote Philip , in which he made some very grave accusations against all the nobles who are your friends  --  a revival of that old story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , he went on to accuse you , personally , of all sorts of schemes . " " How did you happen to see this letter ? " " Philip brought it with him when he came to see me last night . He had not even opened it then , but he finally read it and tossed it aside . I do not need to tell you that is another old story  --  permitting Olivares to make accusations , but not taking them seriously enough to be much influenced by them . I do not know about Carlos , because he does not always take the trouble to stand up for himself ; but I feel sure you will get the governorship of Flanders before very long.  | . Poor old Aunt Clara is failing fast and now that Olivares has plainly said he will not let Carlos succeed her , you certainly would be next in line . No one can say you are too young any more and you have apparently managed to raise the necessary funds on your own responsibility . " " How did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in the letter . Is n't it true ? " " Yes . I have arranged to borrow 240,000 ducats from some Fucars . What has become of the letter ? " Fernando asked , disregardingthe subject of Aunt Clara for the moment . " Why , I 've just told you ! Philip tossed it aside ! So , after he left this morning , I picked it up and made two copies of it . Then I sent the original back to him , so that if he wanted to say anything about it , in the course of his conferences with the Conde-Duque today , he could do so . But I have the copies right here , one for you and one for me . I felt reasonably sure you would come to see me privately before you left . " Isabel walked over to the beautiful inlaid bargueno , which was one of the room 's chief ornaments , as well as one of its most useful pieces of furniture , and , after pulling out several drawers which were in plain sight , reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she extracted two pieces of thin paper , covered with minute handwriting and , after returning one to its hiding place , handed the other to Fernando . He read it with a darkening face : The Infantes must both be separated from all their friends and this voyage to Barcelona will offer a good opportunity for doing it without attracting public notice . Fernando is already kicking over the traces and assuming airs on the strength of his going to Flanders ; and the money at his command is making him dangerous . He and Carlos are close friends and their secret communications indicate an evil bent . Under the pretext of these Cortes in Barcelona Your Majesty might get Fernando and his servants out of Madrid , saying that you wanted him to look after ecclesiastical affairs there and the noble and university members of the Cortes , leaving him there when you return to deal with and close the assembly . Moscoso , whop133has a wife in Madrid and does not like traveling , would stay here and , if he were bold enough to disobey orders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means to upset his projects . As for Don Carlos , when the Admiral is away from him and the Prince absent , his household will assume a very different aspect . Seeing the musters of enemies on our frontiers and the dangers threatening us on every hand , it will be a good plan to send the Catalan nobles to their own estates , to see what troops they can raise , giving out that Fernando is to be their leader , surrounding him with grayheads to keep him more enclosed , and even imprisoned , for it is a grave crime for him to show annoyance , as he does at Your Majesty 's orders . So , Sire , if we get the Admiral away from here there will be a way to prevent him from returning , and the Infante Fernando may remain in Barcelona better occupied than he is now , while Carlos , quieter and in better frame of mind , may stay by Your Majesty 's side . Fernando looked up from the letter and flung it down on the nearest table , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take this lying down ? " he asked between clenched teeth . " Yes , for the time being . Your turn will come later . Besides , do n't forget that while you are gone , Philip will be gone , too , at least the first part of the time and I shall be Regent again . Your friends and mine are the same . You may be very sure that we shall be faithfully looking after your interests . " The royal progress lasted more than two months , the Infantes riding throughout it with loaded pistols at their saddle bows . The first stop of any length was made at Valencia , where the Cortes were convoked and allegiance sworn to Baltasar Carlos . Then the whole Court moved on to Barcelona where , as had been foreseen , there was a long and bitter struggle to get the funds which had been the primary purpose of the trip . Moreover , the Cortes of Cataluna objected violently , not only to voting more money than usual , but to accepting the King 's brother as viceroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body as from the Cortes of Castile , hep134should divide his time between Barcelona and Madrid more evenly ; for the moment , they would be satisfied if he stayed four months . This Philip had no idea of doing and the wrangling went on and on , until the Cortes compromised by consenting to give him the usual supply , without the increase he had demanded , and acceptingFernando as viceroy . After an outburst of temper , which did nothing to improve the status quo , he somewhat sulkily watched his brothers depart for Madrid without him and betrayed his dissatisfaction with his positionby harping on all sorts of minor details , to which , in a more amiable frame of mind , he would have paid no attention : he objectedto having the Deputies appear before him with covered heads ; they insisted this was their prerogative . He forbade them to repair and strengthen the city walls ; they at once trebled the force of men working there . The bickering went on and on . Then he was subjected to an insult which , though indirect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Moscoso had overcomehis dislike for travel and his reluctance to leave his wife ; within a few days after the King 's party had left Barcelona , it was met by Don Antonio who , with an imposing retinue , was on his way to join Fernando . He was summarily ordered to return whence he came and , smarting under this humiliation , complained bitterly to Fernando who , in turn , complained bitterly to Philip . The letter , setting forth his resentment , was sent under cover to Isabel , so it was to her and not to Olivares that was entrusted the task of bringing it to the attention of the King , an infringement on his prerogativeswhich the Conde-Duque deeply resented . The Regent was rapidly supplanting the Privado in official responsibilities . Too late , he began to recognize her power as an antagonist . He had not yet begun to recognize it as an enemy . The King 's return to Madrid was made the occasion of a great auto de fl in the Plaza Mayor and the King and Queen , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from early in the morning until late in the afternoon , while watching the long , gruesome spectacle provided by the indictment and execution of the victims suspected of heresy by the Inquisition . Though such ritesp135were taken as a matter of course and occurred fairly frequently in the Spanish Empire , where they were regarded as an integral part of religious observances , they were not considered joyous occasions , even by the most hardened , and Philip and Isabel were essentially kindhearted . The presentation was something of an ordeal for them and , as the day wore on , they were troubled to see that Carlos appeared depressed and more listless than usual . The long trip had been an exhausting one and summer heat had come earlier and been more intense than was normal . He admitted that he was weary , that he felt feverish ; he begged leave to retire . The royal scion whose health should have been a matter of concern to Olivares was not Baltasar Carlos , but the elder of his two uncles . In a few days the Infante was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a severe shock and the overwhelming grief of his family was shared by great and humble alike . Though there were the usual whisperingsabout poison , as in the case of every sudden death in royal circles , and innuendos to the effect that indiscriminate dissipation had resulted in a disgraceful disease , these were quickly stilled as slanderous . Sir Arthur Hopton , the new English Ambassador , in reporting the tragedy , wrote : The mourning could not be more hearty for the King and they have good reason , for he was a prince who never offended any man willingly , but did good offices for all , being bred upp amonge them to as much perfection as they could expect . And , for once , an official expression of profound regret was quite sincere ; even Olivares could afford to join , without hypocrisy , in the tribute paid to the young Infante 's memory . He had not been ambitious and aggressive enough to cause trouble , except in connection with Fernando , and the latter quickly became less of a problem . The mourning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Infanta Isabel Clara Eugenia finally took place and Fernando'sappointment as Governor of Flanders could no longer be delayed.  |p136FROM  ISABEL DE BOURBON , QUEEN OF SPAIN , TO THE CARDINAL-INFANTE FERNANDO , GOVERNOR OF FLANDERS . MY DEAR BROTHERYousee , I was right ; you had only to bide your time . It was a bitter disappointment to me that I could not see you again before you started on your long journey ; but of course I realized it was logicalthat you should take the most direct route from Barcelona to Italy , so you could make connections in Milan with the Spanish infantrywhich you were to lead to Flanders . Our latest news , however , is that you are not going direct to your new post , as the Emperorhas appealed to you for help , which may delay you considerably . We had hoped that , after the death of King Gustavus Adolphus at the Battle of Lutzen last year , the allies would no longer have the purpose or strength to oppose us . But it seems we lost so heavily in man power  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that we have not been able to make any effective headway in Germany since then . Therefore , as I understand it , Philip and the Conde-Duque are determined to strike an indirect blow at France by checking the progress of the Swedes and Germans , in order to reestablishimperial power in north Germany and thus ensure the encirclementof France , besides proving a standing menace to the Dutch . Of course , I may not have everything straight , as it seems very complicated to me , but I am sure that , now you are in charge of our forces , victory is only a matter of time . YOUR AFFECTIONATE SISTER , ISABEL . Madrid , 8 January , 1634.  |p137FROM  ISABEL DE BOURBON , QUEEN OF SPAIN , TO THE CARDINAL-INFANTE FERNANDO , GOVERNOR OF FLANDERS . MY DEAR BROTHERTheglorious news from Nordlingen has just reached us and is being celebrated with a Te Deum at San Jeronimo 's and , also , with bullfights and bonfires . Philip and I are going to church and , of course , to the bullfights and displays of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was right again  --  only your command and your example as a leader were needed to assure our victory . I am not forgetting that the Spanish infantry is incomparableand that this should mean it is invincible . But I am sure it is the sight of you riding before your men that spurs them on and on until the enemy is no more . I found it hard to believe , as you know , that we had lost twelve thousand brave soldiers at Lutzen . But now I find it easy to believe that there are eight thousand of the enemy dead on the field and that four thousand are our prisoners . What a blow to the policy and prestige of Richelieu ! I hope it does not mean that he will strike back by taking a direct part in this war , instead of operating through the Swedes and Germans . But if it does , I know that he will again meet his match in you . Philip and I are both greatly pleased with all the beautiful objetsd'art  --  obviously spoils of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Retiro , especially as we know that , in your case , these were a free will offering made with much affection , whereas I am afraid this has not always been true . Indeed , some of the nobles have gone so far as to have copies made of their most valuable paintingsand have sent these to the Buen Retiro , secretly keeping the originals themselves . But in the instances where this ruse has been discovered , the Conde-Duque has been furious and the crafty courtiersare out of favor . When Olivares tried to persuade his nephew , the Marques of Leganes , to turn over the pictures and articles of vertu he had acquired in Italy , his wife stepped in and claimed that the whole collection was her dowry , so the Conde-Duque was thwarted that time ! However , his brother-in-law , the Count of Monterrey , has had to surrender the vast store of pictures he secured in Naples ; and all the painters in Madrid are busy copying and designing canvases under the direction of Diego de Velazquez , who has at last returnedp138from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Villa de Medici . Of course , Philip is delighted to have him back and has resumed his frequent visits to the studio in the Alcazar , where Velazquez is hard at work . YOUR AFFECTIONATE SISTER , ISABEL . Madrid , I2 September , 1634 . FROM ISABEL DE BOURBON , QUEEN OF SPAIN , TO THE CARDINAL-INFANTE FERNANDO , GOVERNOR OF FLANDERS . MY DEAR BROTHERWehave just had a state visit from your cousin Margarita , the widowed Duchess of Mantua , who is on her way to Lisbon , where she will be invested with viceregal honors . Of course , there has been the usual round of festivities to celebrate her stay here and Philip and I have been glad to give her a place of honor beside us whenever we have all appeared in public together , though a few of the madrilenos , who always find fault with something , think that is exaggerating the importance of her position . If they are going to murmur , in my opinion , there are sounder reasons for doing so than that . It seems that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ united , because the Portuguese King , Sebastian , had died childless , the latter country was promised by your grandfather , Philip II , that , if he could not be in Portugal himself , a member of the Portuguese nobility or a member of the Spanish royal family should act as viceroy . Since Margarita 's mother was your great-aunt , the Infanta Catherine of Spain , perhaps that takes care of the situation . But I ca n't help wondering how the Duke of Braganzafeels about it  --  after all , his great-grandfather was Edward , the youngest son of King Manuel and his second wife Maria , who , like his first wife , was a daughter of Fernando and Isabel . By rights , the throne should have gone to Catherine , the Duke 's grandmother , but her sex disqualified her for the crown . Your grandfather claimed that he had a prior right , in any case , because of the fact that his mother , Isabel , had been the eldest daughter of Manuel and Maria.  |p139At  present , I think the main idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foreigner , she can be more easily managed by the Conde-Duque than the Duke of Braganza , but I ca n't help feeling that Olivares has made another mistake , which may be even more costly to Spain than the one he made about the Prince of Wales and that the Duke , who is tremendously rich and powerful , may make trouble . YOUR AFFECTIONATE SISTER , ISABEL . Madrid , Io November , 1634 . ORDERS FOR THE VICEREINE OF PORTUGAL FROM THE KING OF SPAIN . MY LADY COUSINIthad been my hope and plan that my beloved brother , the Infante Carlos , might become the Viceroy of Portugal . Owing to his untimely death , my choice has now fallen upon you as Vicereine and I herewith submit a set of rules for your careful observation . Watch out for the Church  --  favor the Inquisition . I recommend inspection visits of prelates . Have a special care to punish public sin . In administration of justice , be there brevity and equity ... . See to it that your administrators of justice be paid their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws . Having convened a tribunal , have the justices come to you with pertinent matter for you to decide on . Thus you do not have to go yourself to tribunal after tribunal . Let them all know that I love them : the Prelates , the Grandees , the Nobles and the People . According to their merits  --  and on your recommendation  --  my vassals will receive my favor . Let special pardons be few and far between so as not to detract from the proper functioning of justice . Matters of State : You will treat every Monday afternoon with my Council of State . Most especially I charge you with the important duty of seeingp140to proper and prompt departure of my fleets for the Indies . On arrival of any ship from the Indies , I charge you to send me , under seal , a copy of its manifest . You still have one copy of the manifest for inspection of the cargo . Tuesdays and Thursdays , in the morning , you will hold public audience for any and all . You will then have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would for going out to Mass , or out to dine . In order to have time to attend all who seek audience , you will generally go to Mass in your own chapel . Whenever you wish , go out to Mass , but at different places , in order to visit one by one all the churches and monasteries . At ordinary audiences , you do not receive hidalgos . They can be received standing , as suits your convenience . Should some of them come on My business , you will receive them in private , telling them to be seated and to keep on their hats . You will bid the following to put on their hats : archbishops and bishops , grandees and titled men whom I have honored . Lisbon being the best and most convenient seat of government , you should be there at all times , with minor exceptions . From my treasury for your annual expenses  --  table and almsgivingand personal expenses  --  you may count on 25,000 cruzados . Documents sent to me with a council decision should have all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your own opinion . In any Royal Tribunal and upon the death of a judge ( or other grave impediment ) you should go ahead and name a substitute to avoid delays . Expedite royal favor for Worthy Subjects in the Indies . You will get annual news of the Indies and if you make up lists of Worthy Subjects residing there and send these quickly to me , I can provide the favors called for in time for the boat mail of the next year 's fleet from Lisbon . Thus , a Worthy Subject in , say Brazil , can get royal favor without ever leaving Brazil . As a precaution against spying , smuggling , etcetera , let no foreignersestablish themselves on the waterfront , but in the middle of the city.  |p141To  no Minister of the Kingdom of Portugal will you give permission to come visit this Court . The Porter of the Chamber will keep the keys of your apartments , and of the offices , including the audience room . As soon as you reach Lisbon , you will convene the Council of State and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rules . YOUR COUSIN , I THE KING . Madrid , 20 November , 1634 . FROM PHILIP IV , KING OF SPAIN , TO THE VICEREINE OF PORTUGAL , REGARDING HER ARRIVAL IN THAT COUNTRY . MY LADY COUSINI have your letter of the 29th of December past in which you tell me of your safe arrival in Lisbon on the loth of the same month . I was pleased to learn that you summoned the Council of State on the 25th and that the orders which I outlined to you , under which work is to be carried on , were proclaimed to the government of this kingdom . I was further pleased to read that you arrived in the best of health . It is my hope that the good results of your zeal and vigilance will be evidenced daily , that I may depend on your assistance in governingand that conditions in the kingdom will greatly improve . Blessed be the name of Our Lord . YOUR COUSIN , I THE KING . Madrid , 24 January , 1635 . FROM ISABEL DE BOURBON , QUEEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FLANDERS . MY DEAR BROTHERI firmly believe that your first defeat may be a blessing in disguise . This is partly because it revealed how greatly you are beloved by the Spanish people . You can not imagine how much tenderness and concern were shown for you on every side . There was not a word anywhere to indicate they felt you had failed them ; on the contrary , the clamor was they were afraid they had been prevented from helping you enough . And when they found out , as they did allp142too soon  --  for , as you know , there are always plenty of spies around  --  that you had written for further resources after you lost the battle at Tirlemont and that the Conde-Duque had concealed the letter from Philip , their fury knew no bounds . Neither did Philip 's . As far as I know , this is the first time that he has flown into a violent rage with Olivares , but , believe me , it will not be the last . What is more , he has not only acted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is determined that , from now on , he will not allow anyone else to make up his mind for him . I do not need to tell you he has never lacked courage and that , though he is indolent by preference about business matters , under normal circumstances he shows remarkableendurance when hunting , riding and cane throwing and he is quite capable of prolonged exertion in other directions when circumstances that are not normal call for it . Now , inspired by your example , he is eager to distinguish himself in the same way that you have , at the head of his armies . He wants to be off to the Catalan frontier , where the French are threatening it , as was to be expected , since Richelieu at last has formally declared war . ( I am afraid the days when he and I could reach an understanding are gone for good ! ) But , apparently , the situation is not really serious there as yet ; even so , the Conde-Duque is opposing Philip 's departure on the ground that the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be sincere about this  --  I do give him credit for being sincere about a few things ! But I am convinced that the main reason he does not want to let Philip go is because that would be the end of the strangle hold on the King 's policies , as well as his person . I do n't know yet what the outcome of all this will be for , though Philip 's first rage has abated somewhat by now , daily squabbles are still going on . It may be that , as far as Philip 's departure for the front is concerned , the Conde-Duque will win out this time , unless some serious new development arises . But , if he 'll only look at it , the handwriting on the wall is already there ; his days of power are numbered . YOUR AFFECTIONATE SISTER , ISABEL . Madrid , 19 July , 1635.  |p143FROM  THE KING OF SPAIN TO DON FRANCISCO DE MELO , CROWN MINISTER OF PORTUGAL . French negotiators are everywhere . Be on the lookout about what the French may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frenchman . I THE KING . Madrid , 26 January , 1636 . FROM ISABEL DE BOURBON , QUEEN OF SPAIN , TO THE CARDINAL-INFANTE FERNANDO , GOVERNOR OF FLANDERS . MY DEAR BROTHERAllthe news from you continues to be good . Of course , it was to be expected that Richelieu would finally come out in the open and declare war on both Houses of Hapsburg ; the wonder was that he did not do so until last year . But that he should also encourage the Dutch to attack you from the rear was an unwelcome surprise . And now the fighting has spread from Flanders and Germany to Italy and part of the time the enemy seems to have the advantage of us . Still , what does that matter when you have advanced so far into Picardy and Champagne and succeeded in pushing your forces beyond the Oise as far as the Somme and actually threatened Paris itself ? When the news of your victories in Picardy reached Madrid , the rejoicings were frantic . Philip and I , accompanied by all the Court , rode to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and when we returned to the palace , after nightfall , the streets were illuminated by thousands of torches . All the Councils were ordered to celebrate the occasion with feasts and they are doing this with great sumptuousness . I am told that those which have already taken place have cost no less than two thousand ducats apiece and others are yet to come which may cost even more . I do not by any means feel sure that this part of the celebration will please you as much as the thanksgiving , because I know you share my anxiety about expenses that are incurred needlessly or greatly in excess of actual needs . But I am afraid there will be no way of limiting them as long as the Conde-Duque is at the helm.  |p144Of  course , the great display of Spanish vigor which your troops have shown has resulted in freeing the Catalan frontier from fears of imminent French invasion . I recognize that this is of great nationaladvantage to us . On the other hand , it means that Philip has been forced to desist from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure this is a good thing , because the CondeDuquefeels he has won his argument that it is best for the King to remain far from the scene of danger . YOUR AFFECTIONATE SISTER , ISABEL . Madrid , I October , 1636 . P.S. We have also had good news from Lisbon : the fleet has come in from Brazil with a cargo of roo cases of sugar , as well as gold and pearls . Te Deum Laudamus was sung in celebration of the safe passage and escape from the clutches of pirates . FROM ISABEL DE BOURBON , QUEEN OF SPAIN , TO THECARDINAL-INFANTE FERNANDO , GOVERNOR OF FLANDERS . MY DEAR BROTHERI am glad that the news from the North continues to be so good , because I am a little troubled by the letters Margarita is sendingus from Portugal . She claims that two Portuguese of dubious background , Miguel Vasconcellos and Diego Suarez , who are not only traitors to their own country , but in the pay of the Conde-Duque , have so usurped her authority that she is but a mere figurehead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be necessary to introduce new taxes , so that these , combined with existing ones , would ensure a fixed assessment of 500,000 cruzados a year . Even though the Portuguesewere told these additional taxes were to be spent in an effortto recover their lost overseas possessions , they were not placated  --  you know how they have always resented the union with Castile . They believed  --  and , I am afraid , rightly  --  that this was just another ruse of the Conde-Duque 's to obtain funds for our use and , consequently , the people in Evora , the capital of Alemtejo , as well as those in the adjoining Province of Algarve , revolted . A rumor spread that Philip would go to Portugal , to restore order , and I am inclined to think it might have been a good thing ifp145he had . But like so many rumors , this one had little foundation in truth . He did send a Spanish force , under the Duke of MedinaSidonia , straight from Andalucia into Algarve , while another army threatened the north of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cowed and the uprisings have gradually subsided , but Margaritafeels this may not be for long and I fear she is right . In this general connection , you may be interested to know  --  if you have n't already heard it  --  that a certain Francisco de Melo , a man of letters who has served as Portugal 's Crown Minister , has been sent here by the Duke of Braganza to acquaint Philip and the Conde-Duque with the tax situation from the Duke 's point of view . I do n't think Melo is going to accomplish much , but he seems to be a rather interesting type of man . He was educated for an intellectual career and proved very precocious ; when he was still in his teens he wrote an epic , after the manner of his fellow Portuguese , Camoens , in honor of the recapture of Bahia and , also , a mathematical treatise and a novel ! But when his father died , leaving him in straitened circumstances , he had to drop his pen and reach for a sword , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Portuguese regiment of infantry , destined for Flanders . But he never reached there , because of a terrible storm at sea , which resulted in a total wreck . After the storm subsided , Melo supervised the recovery of 2,000 cadavers from the Bay of Biscay and saw to it that they were given proper burial . He greatly admires the commanding officer of this ill-fated expeditionand proudly relates how he dressed in his finest regalia to face certain death and , while awaiting it , took from his papers a new sonnetby Lope de Vega and read it to Melo , asking for his opinion ! Of course , he never got to Flanders that time , but I gather he would still like to if occasion arose . He 's lived partly in Madrid and partly in Lisbon for several years now and I suppose I must have seen him around before this , but previously he never made much impression on me . Now he has , as an original . Also , I understand he is more or less responsible for the Conde-Duque 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armies into Portugal . But here I go , gossiping about Melo , instead of congratulating you for preventing Cardinal de la Valette from succeeding in his campaign against you . All in all , this does not seem to be a veryp146good year for France . She has been defeated all along the line in Germany and , worst of all for her , has lost Alsace  --  or , perhaps , that is n't worst of all , perhaps her internal troubles are more serious than her foreign ones . I thought , with the suppression of the Huguenots at La Rochelle , Richelieu would have no obstacles to overcome at home ; but evidently my brother Gaston and our cousin , the Duke of Soissons , are far from being on good terms with my former friend the Cardinal and are doing their best to make trouble for him . So is the Duke 's sister , the Princess of Carignano , from whom we recently had a visit , as well as from her friend ( and their enemy ! ) the Duchessof Chevreuse . These ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A strange situation . I 'd be delighted to have some comment from you on it . YOUR AFFECTIONATE SISTER , ISABEL . Madrid , 5 February , 1637 . FROM ISABEL DE BOURBON , QUEEN OF SPAIN , TO THE CARDINAL-INFANTE FERNANDO , GOVERNOR OF FLANDERS . MY DEAR BROTHERI have let a longer time than usual go by without writing you for two reasons . The first , as you probably guessed , is because of the trouble in the Basque Country . When the French army crossed the Bidasoa River and captured Iriin , the situation already looked serious . When the enemy began to besiege Fuenterrabia and the harbor of Pasages , by both sea and land , of course , it looked worse . But even the Prince of Conde on land and the Bishop of Bordeaux at sea could n't prevail against the Marques de Velez and the Admiral of Castile and their splendid forces . A dashing charge threw panic into the French camp and the besiegers fled . Rejoicing and a sense of elation have , naturally , taken the place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory with a triumphal procession . Philip and I rode in a gilded amber cart , drawn by six horses and preceded by twenty-five coaches , the most magnificent I have seen here , all decked out in silks and velvets and metal ware . The second reason I have not written sooner is because I 've been so enthralled with my new baby , a beautiful little girl , who has beenp147christened Maria Teresa , that I 've hardly paid any attention to anything or anyone else . She is strong and healthy and though , in some ways , we are disappointed because she is not a boy , for we would like to have a second one , on the other hand , thank God , Baltasar Carlos is also so strong and healthy that all anxieties about a male heir to the throne have long since been stilled . Philip and the CondeDuqueare already talking about the alliance with France this birth might facilitate now that , at last , there is also a Dauphin , born at practically the same time as the Infanta . I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already know my brother Louis got caught in a thunderstorm and unexpectedly had to take refuge for the night in poor Ana 's apartments , where , somehow , he made the tardy discovery that he is a man , as well as a king . In Ana 's place , I certainly would not feel very much flattered that , after twenty-two years of nominal marriage , an accident brought about its consummation . On the other hand , I know what it is like to despair of giving an heir to the throne and I am thankful that Ana 's worries on that score are over , though I confess I think she has acted like a fool , both in not finding any way to get the better of my weakling brother , long before this , and also in not handling her affair with Buckingham to her greater advantage . I was very much interested to learn , rather tardily , that , as a result of the uprisings in Portugal , Francisco de Melo  --  the interesting Portuguese about whom I wrote you last year  --  was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that he was put in charge of one . ( This was his first command . ) He could n't find enough volunteers in Portugal and completed one regiment with Castilian volunteers . So he should soon be the one to respond to your call for more forces and , before leaving Spain , he gave a good account of himself when the French fleet attacked Coruna . He fought them off , then effected the embarkation of ten thousand Spanish and Portuguese troops in two days . I feel sure you 'll find him useful to you . YOUR AFFECTIONATE SISTER , ISABEL . Madrid , 3 November , 1638.  |p148FROM  PHILIP IV , KING OF SPAIN , TO THE VICEREINEOF PORTUGAL , REGARDING THE DUKE OF BRAGANZA . MY LADY COUSINGive him all consideration . He is working on special assignmentof the Governor General of the Frontiers of the Realm of Portugal . He will visit Lisbon and will inspect castles and military posts . And all the cavalry and infantry is to be under his orders , just beneathyour command . I have sent to Portugal 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COUSIN , I THE KING . Madrid , 23 March , 1639 . FROM ISABEL DE BOURBON , QUEEN OF SPAIN , TO THE CARDINAL-INFANTE FERNANDO , GOVERNOR OF FLANDERS . MY DEAR BROTHEROf course the principal topic of conversation and the principal cause for concern in Madrid are the invasion of Roussillon and the capture of Salses by the Prince of Conde . The Catalans ' call for help from Madrid has gone unheeded , as far as I can make out because Olivares is determined to make them see how helpless they are withoutCastile and bring them to heel in that way . However , they have managed to raise an army of zo , 000 themselves and , though they lack leaders , they are at least preventing the invasion from spreading . I suppose that is the best we can hope for at present . To turn to a more cheerful subject , I think perhaps it will interestand amuse you to hear how Philip 's birthday  --  it does not seem possible that he is actually thirty-four !  --  was commemorated in Lisbon last April . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parade , which included an empty " coach of respect " decked out in velvet of blue and black and drawn by six chestnut horses from Denmark . Margarita , with the usual regalia of hat and staff of office , was prepared to review the troops on horseback , but her courtiers advisedagainst this  --  they were worried lest the " vigorous " sun of Portugalsmite her . Though she did not agree with them , she graciouslyp149acceded , saying that " her palfrey was not essential to her on such an occasion , as long as she had it to mount the day it were a matter of facing some foreign enemy . " Consequently , she went by litter instead , being protected from the " vigorous " sun by black damask draperies . In a more serious vein , Margarita has expressed concern over rumors she has been hearing about the Duchess of Braganza . I 'm sure you have heard that in March Philip made the Duke second in command to Margarita , with all the cavalry and infantry under his supervision . Anyhow , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lofty position for her husband  --  that of King of Portugal , no less ! Philip pooh-poohs the idea and says he knows the rumors must be unfounded , since the Duchess , who belongs to the senior branch of the Guzman family , is a cousin of the Conde-Duque 's and if anything were a-foot , Olivares would be sure to know about it . But I wonder . . . . Incidentally , she 's also the sister of the Duke of Medina-Sidonia and neither brother nor cousin would mind having a queen in the family , even if that meant disloyalty to Spain . I wonder how the Portuguese feel about her . You know their old saying , " From Spain blows neither a good wind nor a good mar-riage . " We are all well and I wish you could have a glimpse of your young niece , Maria Teresa  --  she is the delight of all who see her and Baltasar Carlos adores her . YOUR AFFECTIONATE SISTER , ISABEL . Madrid , 30 July , 1639 . FROM ISABEL DE BOURBON , QUEEN OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MY DEAR BROTHER-I do not know if you remember the fears I expressed in writing you several years ago , as to whether or not the Conde-Duque would be able to manage the Duke of Braganza as easily as he would the Duchess of Mantua . Perhaps he could have if the Duke had been a bachelor , because he is naturally unambitious and indolent and cares more about hunting and banqueting than he does about doing anything that involves effort or responsibility . He was perfectlyp150happy with the title of Military Governor , which Philip had given him , together with funds to repair fortifications  --  funds he used for something else , though he is tremendously wealthy , owning estates which cover about two-thirds of the country , so he has all he wants to do looking after those . But there is no doubt whatsoever that his wife , the Conde-Duque 's cousin , is aiming higher and that they have a little daughter Catherine for whom they probably already envision a royal marriage . At any rate , yesterday , while Philip was playing cards with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he brought great news and Philip casually asked what it was . " Without making the slightest effort , you have won a great dukedom and vast wealth ! " shouted the Conde-Duque . Philip looked up with more interest and the Conde-Duque bellowed , still more loudly , " The Duke of Braganza has gone mad and proclaimed himself King of Portugal , so it will be necessary for you to confiscate all his possessions . " It was a terrible moment , for of course Philip and the courtiers knew what this meant : that there had been a revolution which could not be quickly suppressed and that union between Spain and Portugalmight well be threatened . I do not need to tell you that Philip dislikes a jest , especial ! , y one that is ill timed ; however , outwardly , he was quite calm . He said , " Then let a remedy be found , " and picked up his cards , which the Conde-Duque knew was a signal for dismissal . Afterward , the game was finished in silence . None of Philip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of making some comment which could be repeated and misinterpreted . But , when he came to my room last night , he sat for a long time with his head bowed in his hands and kept repeating dully , " We have lost Portugal ! We have lost Portugal ! " The next morning , he was ready to face the world with the pretense that the insurrection was bound to be short-lived and in no time this wishful thinking became the conviction that Portugal , like Cataluna , must be brought to heel . But you know , as I do , that Portugal really is lost to us and that Cataluna will never be " brought to heel . " If it ca n't get help from Castile , it will fight the French by itself and we can only hope that it will continue to be as successful as it was when Conde , afterp151his first defeat , returned with a stronger army , to meet defeat again , at the beginning of this year . But if the wild disorders of Corpus Christi Day are an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may very soon expect news from Barcelona as bad as the news from Lisbon . YOUR AFFECTIONATE SISTER , ISABEL . Madrid , Iy December , 1639 . FROM ISABEL DE BOURBON , QUEEN OF SPAIN , TO THECARDINAL-INFANTE FERNANDO , GOVERNOR OF FLANDERS . MY DEAR BROTHERAlas ! My fears in regard to Cataluna were all too well founded . I am writing this while more and more dreadful details about the royal army , too late assembled , under the Marques de Velez , continue to come in . It seems that the Catalans actually combined their forces with those of the French against the Castilians and a battle took place on the hill of Montjuich , outside the walls of Barcelona . When the Marques gave the order to retreat , the last chance of bringing the revolt of Cataluna to a speedy end was lost . Barcelonahas declared itself a French city , more and more French governmenttroops have poured into the country and the remnants of our army have retreated to Tarragona . The situation certainly looks extremely grim , but I still hope and believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course , we have been deeply concerned about the safety of poor Margarita , especially after the news reached us that all the Castilians in Lisbon had been interned in the Fortress of St. George . But shortly after I last wrote you , we learned that she was never in danger and , in fact , she was never even treated with disrespect by the rebels . She showed herself very brave , declining to hide even when the mob was at the very gates of the palace , and was restrained with difficulty by Don Carlos Noronha from going out into the courtyard and making a personal appeal for loyalty to Philip . But it was too late . The crowd was shouting , " Long live our new king ! " and even her promise that the insurgents should be pardoned , if they disbanded then and there , went unheeded . However , though she was asked to leave the palace , so that it might be put in readiness forp152the new king , this request was made courteously and she was then conducted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her ladies-in-waiting and the Archbishop of Braga . After she had spent a few days there , she was escorted , still with perfect politeness , to the frontier and is now in Badajoz . Unfortunately , she has been very ill , which is not surprising considering the strain she has been under ; but she does not blame the Portuguese at all ; in fact , she insists it is evident that , even when they are angry , they still remainattentive and gallant toward ladies . She maintains that all the trouble might have been avoided with a different policy on the part of the Conde-Duque and believes Philip will feel the same when she has had a chance to tell him the inside story . There is no doubt whatsoever that , though the Duke of Braganza , as I thought , was perfectly willing to let things drift , at least for the present , the Duchessshocked him into rebellious action . She kept nagging him , admittingthat he might be penalized if the rebellion were unsuccessful , and then going on to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on or to live in a backwater and under chains ? Death awaits you in Madrid  --  perhaps in Lisbon , too . But in the Castilian Court you would die wretchedly , while in Portugal you could die in glory and as a king . Stop being a coward , stop hesitating . Go ahead and act ! " So , finally , he did and I am afraid Philip is right  --  that we have lost Portugal or that , if we have n't yet , we are going to . But there is one good thing about it : from now on , he 'll never trust Olivares implicitlyagain and , if I 'm not very much mistaken , the Conde-Duque has made one mistake too many and this is the beginning of the end for him . After telling us about her journey to Badajoz , Margarita went on to express some anxiety lest her letter might not reach us , as there has been much tampering with her correspondence and communicationsthat have reached her , allegedly from Philip , were obviously forgeries . Philip is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physicians to her ; he has been most successful in treating her and she is now better . As soon as she is pronounced able to travel , she will go first with her ladies to Merida and then by easy stages to Ocana , where Philip is putting suitable apartments in the palace at her disposal . ( As you know , part of it is already occupied by hisp153love child , Juan of Austria , and his entourage , but there is still plenty of room for another retinue . ) YOUR AFFECTIONATE SISTER , ISABEL . Madrid , 12 February , 1641 . TO HER MAJESTY , QUEEN ISABEL OF SPAIN , FROM FRANCISCO DE MELOYOUR MAJESTYIt is my sad duty to inform you concerning the manner of the illness contracted by the Cardinal-Infante Don Fernando , which culminated in his death here yesterday . After losing Herc , the Cardinal-Infante fell ill with fevers and ague . He had been incapacitated for 88 days when he felt the end was at hand and sought religious consolation . An image of Our Lady of Bois de Duc  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and the Cardinal-Infante greeted this with the hymn , Maria , Mater Gratiae . He had gone only as far as the words , Mater Misericordiae , when he gave up his spirit . Among others with me at the death bed were the Marques of Velada ; the Count of Fontana , Don Andres de Cantelmo and the Archbishop of Malinas , all of whom have requested that I convey their most respectful condolences to Your Majesties with mine on this great loss to the Royal Family , Spain and her people . I remain , Your Majesty 's Most Humble Servant , FRANCISCO DE MELO , FIELD MARSHAL . Brussels , 9 November , 1641.  |p154T  HE death of Carlos had been the occasion of sincere and widespread sorrow ; the death of Fernando was not only the cause of even more profound grief , it was a threatening blow to Spanish prestige . Philip now had no relative with whom to replace the Cardinal-Infante in Flanders , a patrimony of the Hapsburgsthrough their Burgundian inheritance . Field Marshal Franciscode Melo , who had been with the Cardinal-Infante @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain so well , was the obvious choice . However , despite the outstanding record of the Portuguese scholar-soldier , as far as Philip was concerned , no one would have seemed adequate to fill the post in comparison with his beloved brother ; and his lack of faith in the wisdom of the appointment added to his deep and prolonged depression . He kept reiterating that Fernando would have made a much better king than he was  --  which , unfortunately , was true !  --  and that it would have been much better for Spain if he had been the one to die . He took to spending long hours at the Escorial , reciting prayers for the dead and perfecting the design of the royal mausoleum . After vainly trying to console him , Isabel decided to experiment with teasing him by saying that now she was eligible , as the mother of Baltasar Carlos , for burial in the mausoleum , Philip was showing exaggerated interest in its adequacies . He replied with cold fury that her accusation was not only in very poor taste , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who had already died , especially the one dearest to him , on whom he dwelt in his sad petitions and reflections . She had not seen him so angry since he had berated her for re/treating from the Plaza Mayor when la Calderona had been installed on her own balcony ; and Isabel did not again make the mistake of trying to lighten his grief in a way that only deepened it . But , as usual , Olivares sought for means to direct the King 's thoughts , when these were gloomy , into more cheerful channels . It was harder to do this than formerly , partly because the King was no longer as easy to direct as he once had been , and partly because the CondeDuquewas no longer in the most vigorous health , and every extra task represented a real effort . He was having trouble with a shoulder that had been dislocated and unskillfully set ; and he was also troubledwith gout which made him increasingly dependent on a stout cane or crutch . There were not a few who believed that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gout was concerned , that it was a clever device , possessed of magical powers , rather like the hair of the Biblical Samson , in which lay much of the Conde-Duque 's strength . He was wise enough not to disabuse the public of this conviction ; but actually , as he became more handicapped physically , his mental processes also became more labored . After careful consideration , he decided that he had hit upon a plan which might logically dispel Philip 's gloom , besides serving a dual purpose by furthering certain interests of his own . These had been seriously undermined in several ways . Reluctantly and belatedly recognizing the tragic resultsof his policies in both Portugal and Cataluna , he had made superhuman efforts to raise money and armies ; but Castile 's resourceswere now totally depleted and a series of defeats had disheartenedthe royal troops , while giving fresh impetus to their enemies . Olivares had long been hated as a tyrant by the people and now his own kinsmen were beginning to turn against him : his agents had unearthed a conspiracy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brother of Portugal 's new queen and the Conde-Duque 's own cousin ! ) and the Marques of Ayamonte ; and its purpose reached the dizzy heights , not only of supplantingthe Conde-Duque in power by the nobles of Castile , but of making Andalucia , like Portugal and Cataluna , an independent state ! To be sure , the conspiracy had failed , but the Conde-Duque knew that the nobles continued to plot and things were still goingp156badly in Cataluna . The French had completed the conquest of Roussillon by capturing Perpignan and the army commanded by the Conde-Duque 's cousin and close friend , the Marques of Leganes , was defeated in its attempt to recapture Lerida . Something must be done to bolster the Privado 's tottering prestige and , incidentally , to make his private life , as well as his public life , more satisfactory . He hoped to do both together and , choosing a moment which seemed to him propitious , almost without preamble , posed a leading question . " I have been meaning for some while to ask Your Majesty whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledgment of Don Juan ? " " What do you mean by ' acknowledgment ' ? " the King asked abruptly , almost harshly . " I have acknowledged him from the day of his birth . " " Naturally , all the world recognizes him as the son of Your Majesty and knows of Your Majesty 's pride and delight in him , " Olivares said smoothly . But he did not look at Philip as he spoke . He could not risk the chance that the King might guess what was in his thoughts  --  in the King 's thoughts , too , if he were not mistaken . Philip 's first-born son , whose people were gentlefolk , had been taken , shortly after his birth on the estate of his grandfather , the Conde de Chiral , and his baptism with the name of Francisco Fernando , to the house of Don Baltasar de Alamos , Councilor of the Treasury , and had remained there four years . Then , at the suggestion of the Conde-Duque , he had been secretly removed to Salamancaand placed in the charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of Olivares . Philip had approved this plan and the child had been most tenderly treated , as frequent detailed reports to headquartersshowed ; and certainly there must have been every cause for satisfaction or the King would not later have appointed Don Juan de Isasi Ydiaquez governor and tutor of his legitimate son and heir , Don Baltasar Carlos , who was safeguarded at every turn . But , though Philip had sent one of his boon companions , the Count of Humanes , with a midwife to ensure the child 's safe delivery , an actionwhich in itself was a tacit admission of paternity , he had not otherwise acknowledged the little boy until the futility of his guard/ian 's solicitude was revealed through a letter written by Don Jeronimode Villanueva , the King 's Protonotary , to Isasi Ydiaquez to the effect that , " His Majesty had received with the deepest grief the news of the death of Don Francisco Fernando , who showed such bright promise for his tender years . His Majesty highly appreciatedall the care that had been taken with him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the transportationof the poor little corpse , elaborately clothed in red and gold and enclosed in a black velvet coffin , to the Escorial ; and there " the body of Don Francisco Fernando , son of His Catholic Majesty Philip IV , " was entrusted to the Bishop of Avila for burial . Olivares had , indeed , used the wrong word in referring to Don Juan , he told himself ruefully , fearful that his well-laid plans might go astray . If burial in the Escorial were not " acknowledgment , " then he did not know what would be . And , of course , this was not the whole story . There were several other little boys who , the King admitted , were undoubtedly his sons , and whose mothers had been provided for financially , but who , with their mothers , had been consignedto oblivion . There were others about whom the King merely shrugged his shoulders , saying that they might very well be his , but that there was nothing to prove it and that , considering the charactersof the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burdenhis conscience . Olivares , who had introduced Philip to a life of licentiousness when the Prince was a mere boy , and had actually encouragedhis earlier excesses , now had moments of regret for having done so , not because of any moral scruples , but because the almost unbelievable potency of the King complicated the Minister 's life ... . " I asked you , some moments ago , just what you meant by ' acknowledgment , ' " the King repeated , more harshly than the first time . " Surely , it does not require such deep thought as that in which you seem to be engulfed to give me an answer . " " I beg Your Majesty 's pardon . His question diverted my thoughts to others which were correlative . " This time , Olivares did not avert his gaze , but looked boldly at the King , almost as if challenginghim to ask what these correlative thoughts might be ; the Conde-Duque was never discomfited for long . " I meant , " he went on , " that , if such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of bringing Don Juan from seclusion at Ocana for presentation at Court and , by decree , giving him the same semi-royal honors that were bestowed by your grandfather upon his famous half brother for whom this beautiful and promising child was named . " Again , Olivares paused . The King could , of course , have given semi-royal honors to poor little Francisco Fernando , had he been so minded , and he had not done so . In a way , it would have been more logical than in the present case , for Francisco 's mother was a gentlewoman , while Juan 's had been only an actress ; and such a gesture on Philip 's part would have assuaged , at least to some slight degree , the outraged dignity of a family which , hitherto , had no blot on its escutcheon . On the other hand , obviously the erring gentlewoman , though she herself must have been deeply in love  --  how else to explain her lack of resistance ?  --  had failed to inspire the King with anything stronger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of impersonal responsibility ; whereas la Calderona . . . . Besides , as far as Olivares knew , Philip had never once visited Francisco Fernando in Salamanca , though he always managed to make frequent excursions to Ocana . The gentlewoman 's child had meant nothing to him ; the actress ' child was his best beloved .... " The celebration could and should be made the occasion of numerousfestivities to mark the event , " Olivares continued . " I am sure the Papal Nuncio would take a prominent part in such an affair . It is even possible that His Holiness might send the Apostolic Blessing to the young Prince . " " Urban ? Despite his well-known animosity toward Spain , which Richelieu is doing his best to foster ? " " Despite any disadvantages which might occur to Your Majesty . If one stops to think of those , instead of favorable circumstances , very little is accomplished in this world . " " And what are the favorable circumstances in this instance , as you see them ? " " The temper of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There have not been too many lately and , as Your Majesty knows , it is well to give constant and careful thought to this aspect of his reign . Besides , there is real eagerness to see Don Juan , of whose gal/lantry and good looks so much has been heard and so little visualized . It is time to reverse that order of things . Most of all , I am thinking of the satisfaction it would give Your Majesty to witness this ceremony . I am right , am I not , in believing it would make Your Majesty 's heart glad ? " Philip did not have sufficient will power to deny this , though he was well aware that Olivares had an ulterior motive which he had not mentioned : public recognition of the King 's illegitimate son would facilitate that of a young man , the Conde-Duque 's offspring , whom he was trying , somewhat belatedly , to force on his family and on the Court . The person in question , now introduced as Enrique Felipez de Guzman , had previously gone by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government official in Madrid . He was without any special attainments and he was not personally attractive ; the entire Guzman family , with the exception of the CondeDuque , were violently opposed to his acceptance as one of them . But the Pritrado was infatuated with him and realized that much of the opposition would be stilled if the King would recognize him . Philip was equally aware of this and had already gone as far as he felt was wise , if he were not to risk offending a powerful clan , in showing favors to the newcomer . But he could likewise visualize just how his own love child would look as he received the plaudits of the multitudeand closed his consciousness to the correlative effects which Olivares had in mind . Though Juan otherwise strongly resembled his mother , he was as dark as she had been fair ; and not the least factor in his appeal to the public was his coloring  --  that of a typical Spaniard and not of a typical Hapsburg . If he had been sandy-haired , blue-eyed and lantern-jawed , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed his mind , though with more difficulty , to the consciousness that , though the Queen would not refuse to grace the ceremony with her presence , her heart would not be glad to see her son 's half-brother occupying the preeminent place which should have rightly been that of Baltasar Carlos on any grand occasion . The heir to the throne , so tardily born , was a sturdy , attractive little boy , popular in Madrid . His smile was winning , his manner frank andp160friendly . He rode his plump pony well , he was already interested in hunting , he was much in evidence at all times , his name was given to fresh regiments as these were raised . But he could not compare with Juan in either brilliance or beauty , nor had he captured the imagination of the people to the same dazzling degree . He was the symbol of heritage and hereafter , rather than romantic present , and his royal state raised him above the populace , who felt that la Calderonahad been one of them and that , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to the Queen 's . They would wildly rejoice at the prospect of welcoming Don Juan to their midst . Neither Philip nor Olivares had miscalculated the varied effects of Don Juan 's presentation in Madrid . The formal declaration of the boy 's semi-royal state was followed by a series of great festivals and triumphant processionals , in the course of which the King received the official congratulations of the Papal Nuncio , the princes of the blood and the grandees of the realm ; meanwhile , the public became tumultuous in its joy . After the great ceremonials were over , Juan was conducted to the palace to kiss the hands of the King and Queen and the heir to the throne ; and , though Isabel received him with quiet dignity , the warmth which was one of her most charmingcharacteristics was totally lacking in her manner . She failed to address Juan as mi hijo  --  my son  --  a favor Philip had requested of her and Baltasar Carlos was equally cool in his greeting , omitting the mi hermano  --  my brother  --  which Philip had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed his halfbrotheras " Vos "  --  " You "  --  the term used in speaking to nobles , but not to royalty ; and , cutting short Juan 's petition for affection , he said , " I shall love you in as far as I see you are properly serving His Majesty , my father . " The Queen and the Crown Prince were not alone in their qualifiedenthusiasm for the series of festivities celebrating the acknowledgmentof Don Juan . As had been foreseen , the formal legitimationof the Conde-Duque 's protege , now officially know as Enrique Felipez de Guzman , was among these gala events and he forthwith summoned a family council and required his sisters and all their children to address the newcomer as " Excellency " and recognize him as their relative . Not only those nearest the Conde-Duque , butp161Castilian nobility in general , regarded this demand as an insult ; and the indignation became even more widespread when Enrique 's marriage to Leonora de Unzueta , a girl of unblemished reputation and good family , whose father , Don Leonardo de Unzueta , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no question of coercion , a lacking baptism , previous marriage in the case of eitherone , impotence on the part of the bridegroom or the refusal to cohabit on the part of the bride ; but the marriage had been privately performed in the home of the bride 's widowed mother , instead of in a church , and the Conde-Duque , whose vaulting ambition visualizeda much more brilliant alliance for his protege , seized on this as a technicality . The Governor of the Archbishopric of Toledo was permitted a free hand by Rome in dealing with the case and the newly married couple , who were deeply in love , were forcibly separated , the groom being sent to the home of his tutor , Jeronimo Legarda , and the bride to the Convent of the Piedad in Guadalajara . The poor girl pleaded against the sentence , appealing tearfully to convents , confesionarios , courts of justice , doctors of jurisprudence and theologians ; and the great Jesuit , Gonzalez Galindo , Lector of Theology at the Corn pania 's college in Madrid ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolution after confession ) in a public paper pronounced the annulment a mortal sin against religion , justice and charity . But all this , of course , was of no avail when the Conde-Duque had decided otherwise . As soon as the decree of annulment was signed , he ordered the Constable of Castile to authorize an alliance between his daughter and the Conde-Duque 's son . A vicious couplet , satirizing this second marriage , was soon circulating through the streets of Madrid and the great satirist , Quevedo , lashed out at the Privado in a searing memorial . Almost immediately thereafter , Quevedo was arrested at the home of his friend , the Duke of Medinaceli  --  whohimself was exiled  --  and secretly conveyed to prison in distant Leon . The circumstances surrounding this arrest and imprisonment were veiled in mystery and the reasons attributed to these were vague ; but it seemed unlikely to his friends that the timing was wholly coincidental and that the Conde-Duque was not at least par/tially responsible for it . For several years , Quevedo had been living quietly in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the province of Ciudad Real , and his great tortoise-shelled spectacles and sober black garb had seldom been seen on the Liars ' Walks . He had been less vituperative than formerly in his satires deriding and denouncing the follies and vices of the Court ; on the other hand , there had been murmurs about his association with the Papal Nuncioand the French Ambassador which were not to his credit as a loyal Spaniard and , in the pathetic letters he wrote from his foul cell to the Conde-Duque and others , he referred to " false friends " who were responsible for his misery , as if there were several such enemies . It even seemed possible that the King , if not directly responsible for his incarceration  --  any more than he had been directly responsible for the murder of Villamediana  --  had done nothing to prevent the imprisonment in the beginning and had tolerated it after it was a fait accompli . Philip had sometimes been an appreciative listener to Quevedo 's biting verse and malicious prose and the play , Who Lies Most Thrives Most , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed at an entertainment given in the King 's honor by the Countess of Olivares and " the smart sayings and courtly gallantryof Quevedo with which it was crammed delighted the Monarch . " But at other times these risky meters had irritated him and the poet was in exile almost as often as he was in favor . Prison was not an infrequent aftermath of exile . As far as the King was concerned , he did not allow the Queen 's annoyance , the resentment of the Guzmans or Quevedo 's unhappy fate to interfere with the pleasure he found in the companionship of his elder son . Juan 's " ardor of spirit , " which so far surpassed that of Baltasar Carlos as to be a constant source of jealousy to Isabel , was a constant source of joy to Philip . The boy was already a fine horseman and a good shot and he excelled not only in sports , but in his studies . He spoke Latin as fluently as he spoke Spanish and his aptitude for mathematics astounded his Jesuit tutor , Father Ricardi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start studying again himself if he did not want to be outdistanced in the classics and the sciences . He hoped he could still hold his own in forest and field.  |p163After  semi-royal honors had been bestowed on the boy , his residencewas changed from the old walled city of Ocana to the regal country seat of the Zarzuela on the Manzanares River , near the suburbanpalace of the Pardo , where Philip had spent his honeymoon and which served him as a glorified hunting lodge . The name was derived from the zarzas , whose bristly growth covered the fields all around the house , which had originally been built for Philip 's belovedbrother , the Infante Fernando , whose tragic death in Flanders had been a source of such deep grief to the King . He found a source of solace in seeing it put to new usefulness again for another dearly beloved , appointing the Count of Fontanar as its governor and providing a staff which included three noblemen , three chief clerks , three doctors , a surgeon , twenty-eight royal pages , five servants of lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coachmen , lackeys and muleteers . The mansion house was of the type known as a palacete , a structure not sufficiently large and imposing to be called a palacio , but still with palatial attributes . It was a beautifullyproportioned , one-story , rectangular building with a highpitched , dormered roof and a high perron , its granite columns interposedat regular intervals between the rosy bricks of its walls ; and from it could be seen the rooftops , towers and churches of Madrid rising beyond its rolling terrain . Fountains sparkled and flowers bloomed brightly in the gardens with which it was surrounded and they , in turn , formed terraces above a series of porticoed galleries ; and these gardens provided a charming mise en scene both for the light operas which were a favorite form of diversion at the Zarzuela and which , in turn , took their name from the estate , and for the alfrescosuppers which were prepared in a great pot buried in the ground and surmounted with coals . Veal , mutton , pigeons , hare , pigs ' feet , pigs ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this way . Sometimes as many as four thousand guests feasted on them at a sitting ; and there was always food left over to send back to Madrid . Beyond the flowering terraces lay the farmery or " physic garden , " plentifully supplied with everything on the so-called Charlemagnelist  --  " plants and trees to be planted in the royal domaines , " including pennyroyal , catmint , mallow and lavender ; and beyondp164this lay kitchen gardens , orchards and nurseries and beyond these the woodlands deepening into forests , where many kinds of game abounded . Considering his predilection for both theatricals and hunting , no one expressed surprise at the frequency of the King 's visits to the Zarzuela and no one felt any because Juan was admittedly a further and very special attraction . Any man might well be proud of such a son.  |p165GASPAR  de Guzman , Count of Olivares , Duke of Sanlucar and Principal Chamberlain to His Majesty , was taking his ease in the quiet of the evening with his friend , Jeronimode Villanueva , Marques de Villalba , His Majesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' lame leg rested comfortably on a stool and both men were richly but informallydressed for , now that the golilla  --  a spreading collar covered with white material on its inner surface and on the outer with dark cloth to match the doublet  --  had superseded the wide cylinder of the great ruff , known as the lettuce frill , they were not half throttledany more . Doublets were correspondingly easy of fit ; stiffness was no longer a sign of elegance and a sheltered garden , like this one , offered an excuse for latitude which the palace grounds could not have afforded . The day had been one of unseasonable heat and both men were half reclining on divans ; the trickle of the three fountains , which were a special feature of the garden , and the chirpingof the small birds , confined in the golden cages that hung along the wall of the house , were the only sounds that penetrated the restfulstillness . For some time there had been companionable silence between the two men . Then Olivares , fingering a half-empty glass , asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my friend , that the King is showing signs of restiveness ? " " It has crossed my mind . Of course , he worries a great deal about Portugal and Cataluna , but I had thought that the Zarzuela would provide all the necessary distractions . It seems I was mistaken . Have you any suggestions for a remedy ? "  | " It had been my hope that the Buen Retiro might do so . But , if I have failed there , another avenue of approach to excitement can certainly be opened by you . " Gaspar de Guzman , while referring openly to his own contributionsto the King 's diversions , deemed it wiser to permit his boon companion to discover for himself " the avenue of approach " which the Conde-Duque had in mind . After all , though he was given to bold measures , it was sometimes convenient to be able to claim that an actual suggestion had come from someone else , that he had only been helpful in carrying it out and , in this case , that happened to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buen Retiro , so was the Queen ; when he went to a ball , so did she ; when he took part in a cane tourney or a masque , she was in a place of honor among the spectators ; when there was a bullfight , she shared his place of honor . The Queen was still a beautiful woman , a regal figure ; she had an appreciation of drama , of music and of art as keen as the King 's and she could share his enjoyment of these intelligently . But , after all , Philip had now been married to Isabel for more than twenty years and , after many disappointments , they had at last achieved two charming children , Baltasar Carlos , the heir to the throne , and Maria Teresa , already envisioned as a future Queen of France . Isabel no longer represented to the King a temptation , a novelty , a mystery , a challenge or a danger ; and Philip needed at least one of these ingredientsto still his restlessness . So that was why Gaspar de Guzman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time , felt it wiser not to define temptation , novelty , mystery , challenge or danger . The situation was extremely delicate , not to say tricky . Some years earlier , Villanueva had founded a convent for Benedictine Nuns , which had been given the name of San Placido , and which was located next door to his own residence . At that time , he was betrothed to a very beautifulgirl , Dona Teresa Valle de la Cerda who , " suddenly smitten with Divine Grace , " had given her dowry to her novio 's convent and entered it as a novice . Eventually , she had become its abbess and , shortly thereafter , it had become involved in such scandals  --  largely as the result of the tales circulated by its chaplain , Fray FranciscoGarcia Calderon  --  that it had been ordered closed by the Holyp171Inquisition and the unfortunate abbess had been confined elsewhere . The scandals had finally been hushed up  --  there were always plenty of new ones to arrest public attention ; the convent had reopened ; and Dona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abbess and  --  according to reliable report  --  had induced some very promising and attractive young ladies to present themselves as postulants to the Order . Just why Dona Teresa had retreated from such an auspicious match as marriage with Jeronimo de Villanueva would have represented , in order to lead a life at least nominally dedicated to chastity , poverty and obedience , no one , not even Olivares , had been able to figure out . The only reason given had not been a convincing one : Divine Grace did not often seem to smite that hard in Court circles . The fact that the erstwhile lovers became and remained friends and collaborators would have been equally puzzling if , meanwhile , Jeronimo had not become Teresa 's brother-in-law . As it was , there seemed to be no resentment on his side for having been jilted , no disappointment on hers for having  --  theoretically  --  renounced the world , the flesh and the devil . ( Though the world came freely to the locutories at San Placido and some of it was very fleshly ; while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread and which had been responsible for the temporary closing of the convent ! ) Villanueva seemed quite as pleased to have Dona Teresa as the head of the convent he had founded as he would have been to have her his wife ; and she seemed quite as pleased to welcome him to the locutory as she would have been to preside at his table . What else or what more , if anything , there was in the relationship that providedthem mutual satisfaction no one knew , and those who hazarded guesses did so secretly . . . . But now Olivares was not hesitating to say that , perhaps , Villanueva could suggest a new avenueof approach to the King 's enjoyment . " I understand that , when he is not at the Zarzuela , he spends more and more of his leisure with Diego de Velazquez , " Villanueva said idly  --  so idly that Olivares had the impression he was playing for time : the Aragonese knew perfectly well it was not pastimes like this that the Conde-Duque had in mind . " True . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driftsp172in , whenever the mood suits him , to watch Velazquez at work . He is immensely pleased with his choice of a Court Painter  --  his offer of a salary of twenty ducats a month , with extra payment for each picture , was a sound investment . The portrait of Baltasar Carlos on horseback , placed over a doorway , and the whole series of battle scenes , including the Surrender at Breda , which encircle a large importantapartment , are a source of constant pleasure to him and of admiration to everyone who sees them , as I do not need to tell you . Very often , the Queen goes to the studio with His Majesty . The painter 's children are well behaved , his wife comely and cordial  --  in fact , the visits are taking quite the tone of family affairs , " Olivares concluded , adroitly putting into words his hitherto unspoken thought that , possibly , the Queen might be almost too constant a companion . " And you thought he might welcome a change ? " " Only by way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind ? " Well , so the definite suggestion would have to come from Olivares , after all . Villanueva was too shrewd to make it himself and risk having this brought home to him later on . " Only something for which there is excellent precedent . It is said that in the early days of the great St. Teresa the best society of Avila was to be found in the locutory of the Encarnacion . It is now said that , in the days of San Placido 's renascence , the best society of Madrid is to be found in the locutory of this convent . " " On which side of the grille ? " " Naturally on both , considering its patron  --  and its abbess . " " Its patron and its abbess will , of course , be greatly honored to receive the King and any friend of his whenever they choose to presenttheir compliments . " " Thank you . And , now that you have assured me of this , " Olivares added , speaking idly in his turn , " perhaps I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the novices are so pleasing , it is almost a pity their charms should be wholly concealed in a cloister , and that one of them is quite exceptionally beautiful . Of course , they do go out into their garden for air and recreation , which makes a little change for them . Have you , by any chance , been able to seep173anything of them by glancing over the wall of your own garden ? " " I get an occasional glimpse , that is all . Hardly enough to pick out one girl as exceptionally beautiful . " " Not even if you had been looking for such a paragon ? It seems there was one whose profession was marked by celebrations of extraordinaryelegance , both at her family home and at the convent , and all those who attended were delighted with them . You must certainly have heard about this , even if you were not actually presentat the occasions in question  --  and I must confess that your absence , if indeed you were absent , seems very strange . After all , San Placido is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Villanueva made only a noncommittal gesture , Olivares continued , " Under ordinary circumstances , the abbess would naturally choose one of the older nuns among those who hold office in the Communityto accompany her when she came to the locutory . But , under the circumstances which we have now mentioned , possibly the presentationof this charming child would be appropriate . " " I see that , as so frequently happens , there has been a meeting of minds between us , " Villanueva said suavely.  |p174JUST  as no chain is any stronger than its weakest link , no plan is successful beyond the point where it falters . Dona Teresa , as her friends continued to call her , raised no objectionswhen her former fiance said that two friends of his with unexpectedleisure on their hands had asked to have her receive them in the locutory . She still raised no objections when their very inconsequentialdisguise had been penetrated , and she recognized her visitorsas the Conde-Duque and the King . And , since royalty must be permitted to choose its own visiting hours and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she accepted , without question , the statement that the gentlemen would find it more convenient to come to San Placido in the evening and that they would enjoy conversing with some of the young ladies who , like Dona Teresa herself , had been led by Divine Grace to embrace the conventual life . Several girls consequently succeeded the Prioress , the Cellarer , the Treasurer and the Infirmarian as the Abbess ' companionwhen she received her callers . Three of these novices , Sor Benita , Sor Carlota , Sor Maria Beatriz , were comely ; one , Sor Margarita , was exceptionally beautiful . For more than a week , all the young girls , including Sor Margarita , kept their hands modestly clasped under their scapulars and their eyes cast down , as they quietly listened to the conversation of their elders or answered meekly and briefly when they were directly addressed . Then , without warning , at the question , " Sor Margarita , how did it happen you felt sure of a vocation ? " the girl raised her head and looked the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was my parents who felt sure of it . "  |p175The  words in themselves would have been shocking enough , but her glance was as brazen as her words . Sor Margarita had the most extraordinary eyes that Dona Teresa had ever seen : a pure deep emerald , clear as crystal and fringed with long thick black lashes . Her skin was as white as a lily , without the slightest tinge of color in her cheeks ; and the contrast which her green eyes and black lashes made to this pallor was startling and stimulating in its effect . After this outburst and this glance , Dona Teresa felt no surprise when she learned her callers hoped it might usually be Sor Margarita who would be chosen to accompany her ; and one night when she was suddenly called away to minister to an elderly nun who had been smitten with some mysterious illness , she hesitated to leave the locutoryeven for a few minutes , though Sor Margarita was entrenched on one side of the grille and the two gentlemen on the other . On her return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Margarita had changed the subject of their conversationrather abruptly on her arrival . But , after all , it was merely an impression ; she tried to dismiss it from her mind . The sick nun required a great deal of attention in the course of the next few days and Dona Teresa was called to her bedside at frequentintervals . Since some of these summons came during the nocturnalvisiting hours , it occurred to the Abbess that it might be betterif one of her close subordinates in rank , possibly the Prioress , accompanied Sor Margarita to the locutory . But then , Dona Teresa was never gone long at a time and , though her sandals permitted her to come and go so silently that she could easily have surprised a scene which was in any way an offense to decorum , she neither saw nor heard anything to trouble her . The sick nun recovered , there were no more impressions of interrupted conversations and the visits , which at first had been almost nightly , decreased in frequency . Then another impression , a different one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked even paler than usual , if that were possible , and that her manner , usually so controlled , had lost some of its composure . At last , she decided to question the girl . Perhaps she had another invalid on her hands . And the thought crossed her mind that , if Sor Margarita were not well enough to go to the locutoryfor a few nights , it might be a very good thing . Villanueva'sp176friends with unexpected leisure on their hands might find a new interest . Having decided to question her , she sent for Sor Margarita that same day after Vespers and invited her to sit down , instead of keeping her standing after she reached the Superior 's office , and asked her kindly if she were not feeling well . At first , Sor Margarita simply sat staring at the Abbess with her disconcerting green eyes ; then she began twisting her hands and shaking her head to emphasize the words which denied any physical discomfort . At length , seeing that she was getting nowhere with the girl , the Abbess dismissed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereafter , there was a knock at the door and , even before the Abbess could respond , it was pushed open and Sor Margarita reentered . " I 'm not sick . But I 'm beginning to be frightened , " she whispered . " I do n't think I can see it through . " The abrupt change in her voice and manner were not only surprising , they were disturbing . " My dear child , why should you be frightened ? " Dona Teresa asked soothingly . " What is there that you can not see through ? Sit down again and tell me what has alarmed you. , , The girl resumed her seat and began twisting her hands again . Dona Teresa waited for her to compose herself and at last Sor Margaritaspoke hysterically . " He 's coming here , " she said . " He 's coming into the cloister . To visit me when I 'm alone . At night . " " Sor Margarita , you must compose yourself . You are not well , you are permitting yourself to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You must know as well as I do that , even if anyone desired to commit such a sacrilege , it would be impossible for him to do so . The doors leading into the cloisters are heavily barred and bolted . " " Yes . The doors in front . " " And the arcade which surrounds the courtyard in the rear is high and has no outer opening . You must have been troubled by some false nightmare , inspired by the devil , to imagine what you have just told me. "  | " It may have been inspired by the devil , but it is not a false one . They are digging a tunnel . " " Who are digging a tunnel ? " " The workmen employed by the gentleman who lives next door  --  your friend , Don Jeronimo de Villanueva . " If she had not used those two words , " your friend , " Dona Teresa might have found a readier and more casual answer . As it was , Sor Margarita spoke again before she could frame one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tunnel . It is for one of the friends who comes here . It was the other friend who suggested it . He had learned that the third gentleman wishes to visit me alone at night and said that , since this was the case , something must of course be arranged , for every wish that this gentleman expressedhad to be granted . The third gentleman  --  it is the King , is it not ? " " Hush , Sor Margarita , you must not ask that ! The gentleman of whom you speak does not wish his identity known . " " But is there anyone else of whom the other gentleman would say that if he wishes to come to a nun at night , the way must be made easy for him to do so ? " The Abbess gave no direct answer . Instead , she rose and put her hand on the girl 's shoulder . " How long have you known of this plan ? " she asked , forcing herself to speak quietly . " The first time you left me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brigida , who was so suddenly taken ill , the one whom you say I must not name put his face very close to the grille and whispered that he wanted to look more closely into my beautiful green eyes , but before I could answer him , you returned , so nothing more was said about it that evening . However , the next time  --  " " Do you mean the next time the gentlemen made us a visit or the next time I was called away ? " " Both . You were called away the next time they visited us . Do n't you remember ? As you have been several times since ! " " Yes , that is true . So then  --  " " Then it was the Conde-Duque who whispered to me . Surely Ip178do not need to pretend about knowing him , for your friend Don Jeronimo de Villanueva calls him by name all the time . He said everything was arranged and that , as soon as the tunnel was finished , he would let me know . Night before last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold myself in readiness for a visit . Your friend Don Jeronimo had already told him which room would be available  --  the one at the end of the corridor nearest the stairs , which is vacant just now , owing to the reduced number of novices . Unless I receive a message to the contrary , I am to go there tomorrownight after Compline . " Until she spoke the words , " hold myself in readiness for a visit , " she had been fairly composed . As she said , " I am to go there tomorrownight after Compline , " she was almost incoherent with excitement . The Abbess had continued to lean over her and now she put her arm around the girl 's shoulders and spoke firmly . " My child , you must control yourself . Go to your cell and stay there quietly tonight , Tomorrow , continue your daily tasks as usual and put this disturbing episode out of your mind . Of course , you will not come to the locutory at any time in the foreseeable future . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege of a private interview . I do not think he will decline to grant me one and he will certainly listen to me . When I talk with him , I shall be able to make him understand that this sacrilegious plan must be abandoned . "  |p179DON  Jeronimo de Villanueva did not decline to grant the Abbess the privilege of a private interview . He arrived promptly at the hour she had set and was shown into the locutory , which had been closed to all other visitors . He had hardly taken his seat in the armchair beside the grille when the curtainsparted and the Abbess confronted him , her face unveiled . " Don Jeronimo  --  " she began sternly . But , before she could continue , he raised his hand as if in protest and interrupted her with a smile . " My dear Teresa , " he said pleasantly , " since this is a private interview , why not be natural with each other ? I gather that you have something quite confidential to say to me and confidences always come more easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What I have to say to you is indeed confidential , but it is not to be treated like small talk , as you seem to think possible . It concernsan outrage . " " Really ? In this convent which I had the honor to found and over which you have done me the honor to preside ? A convent which has managed to surmount calumnies and triumphantly resumethe even tenor of its ways ? You surprise me , Teresa , you do indeed . " " Not as much as you have surprised me . If anyone had told me that you would lend yourself to such a nefarious scheme as has been revealed to me , I would have told my informer I knew he was lying . " " Should the man who was merely doing his poor best to pleasep180his sovereign , which is his bounden duty , be accused of nefarious schemes ? " " Yes , if his poor best , as you rightly call it , leads him to sacri-lege . " Villanueva sighed . " I can see , my dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I regret . I know the heavy burden of your cares and would not willingly add to them . I am sorry if a silly girl , who has not the intelligence to match her undeniably good looks , has done so . She had only to keep her mouth shut and , in a short time , what you are pleased , with exaggeration unworthy of you , to call an outrage would have been a fait accompli . A king 's passion would have been assuaged and a novice would have had a pleasantly exciting memory of a royal lover to cherish during the long years of chastity , poverty and obedience which lie ahead of her . And no one would have been the wiser or sadder for this little infringementof your rules . Now , I will admit that the situation is somewhat altered . The seduction will not be as much of a secret as I had hoped . You are upset . The girl , instead of being discreet , as we had every reason to expect , is a chatterbox . She told us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green eyes of hers , that her vocation was of her parents ' doing , not of hers . I do not feel in the least sure that she had not already been indiscreet and that this former indiscretion had something to do with her being hurried into a convent . I thought she would be secretly pleased at our plan . I still do not feel too sure that she is not . Be all that as it may , none of it alters the fact that the King will come here tomorrow night , as arranged , and that Sor Margarita must be prepared to receive him . " " My friend , you can not ask me to connive in such a crime ! " " And since when , Teresa , have you considered the act of love a crime ? " He looked at her steadily as he asked the question and she met his sardonic gaze without faltering . But when she answered , her tone , though clear , was sad . " You know that I do not consider the act of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons dear to each other , whose mutual devotion has deepened to mutual passion and when this has the approval of our Holy Mother the Church  --  or its condonationp181for some special reason , " she added . " But rape is a crime , even when it is not committed in a cloister , against a prospective nun , and this would be rape . Sor Margarita is very young . She is unready in every way for the experience to which you would subject her . " " Come , Teresa , how many girls have you known who do not claim to be terrified at the mere mention of such a thing as seduction ? Some sincerely enough , no doubt . Others only because they think it seemly . And the more they protest , the more often they have no reason to fear because , actually , they are already deflowered . They are only afraid of being found out or of still more dire consequences . Do what you can to calm this silly girl since she has seen fit to go running to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any girl worth her salt , frightened or not , would have done . " " May I confess to you that Sor Margarita is not the only one who is frightened ? " Villanueva laughed easily . " Surely , my dear , you will not admit that the slight uneasiness caused you by our little brush with the Holy Inquisition some years ago has developed into timidity ? Especiallywhen the Inquisitor General is the King 's own confessor , as well as the boon companion of the Conde-Duque . There is naught to fear from that quarter , I assure you . Nothing is more pleasing to the good Friar Archbishop than the knowledge that commands given by His Majesty and His Majesty 's Chamberlain have been respected . Please believe me , there is far more danger in disobeying their orders than in following them . So see to it that Sor Margarita is ready for the King tomorrow night . For he will be here . " The passage from the basement of Villanueva 's house on the Calle de la Madera to the basement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , it deserved a more complimentarydesignation than the word tunnel , Philip told his host , as they went through it together , lighted by the lantern which Villanueva carried . It was wide enough for them to walk abreast and high enough to clear their heads , though both were tall men ; and , underfoot , it was smooth . The King lauded his protonotary on having achieved so finished a piece of digging in so short a time . " One would almost think , " he said , " that there might have beenp182a passage of sorts here before and that it had simply been enlarged and improved . This , of course , would have been before your occupancyof your present palace or the San Placido nuns of their presentconvent . How fortunate for me that you discovered it ! " " I am delighted that it is so satisfactory to Your Majesty , " Villanueva replied gravely . He opened a door , revealing a dimly lighted stone stairway . " The first flight will take you only to the ground floor , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flights . Then walk straight ahead of you and enter the first door on your right . " The stairs were steep and winding , engulfed in silence except for the King 's echoing footsteps ; and little lamps , set in niches along the ascent , gave enough light to clarify the way . The King mounted without haste and with increasing anticipation . Everything was going smoothly . There were no impediments to his progress and he was satisfied that there were no spying glances watching it . He reached the long corridor lined with cells and excitedly unlatchedthe door of the first one on his right . Then he recoiled in horror . Sor Margarita was , indeed , waiting for him . The Abbess had not been able to prevent the assignation . But the young novice , clad in the purest white , lay on a bier , her eyes closed , a crucifix on her breast , tapers burning at her head and feet . If she herself had not preferred death to dishonor , then the Abbess must have chosen it for her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened it and rushed toward the stairs . Then , almost as hastily , he turned back and reentered the room . If the girl were dead , that was the end of the matter , a hideous and evil end . But was she ? Suddenly , he doubted the authenticity of this capilla ardiente . He walked over to the bier and stood close to it . At first , he could detect no sign of life . Then , watching carefully , he saw a slight flicker of the eyelids . He leaned closer still and listened . The girl 's breath was suppressed , but it had not ceased . He drew back with a sharp utterance that was edged with mockery , rather than horror . " A clever ruse , Sor Margarita , on the part of your Abbess , " hep183said . " But not quite clever enough . She counted , with reason , on my fright , but failed to consider that scepticism and ardor might overcome revulsion . I should have thought her more resourceful as to ways and means , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters . But let that pass . It is not the Abbess with whom I am concerned , but with the loveliest of her novices . Is it possible that I misread the invitation which seemed so unmistakablewhen we were separated by the grille ? If I did , you have only to say so . But I shall not believe it until I meet the gaze of your green eyes again . Open them and look upon your King . "  |p184UNEXPECTEDLY  to all concerned , the person placed in the most perilous position as a result of the King 's escapade was neither the Abbess nor Sor Margarita , but Jeronimo de Villanueva . That the spies of the Holy Office would ferret out the facts concerning the devil-may-care intrusion had , naturally , been a recognizedrisk from the beginning . But that Antonio de Sotomayor who , as Villanueva himself had reminded Teresa , was the King 's confessor , as well as the Inquisitor General , would take active steps to punishan intimate of Philip 's for catering to a king 's fancy had entered no one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of course sacrosanct , whatever his offenses , was in itself so powerful a safeguard that it seemed inviolable . However , Sotomayor , after rebukingthe King more severely than he had ever done before , declinedto let the matter rest there ; he pronounced Villanueva guilty of sacrilege and demanded his arrest . When it came to a showdown , however , the King still held the strongest hand . Besides , though it was not in his easy-going nature to harbor a grudge , he felt that Sotomayor had exceeded his prerogativesby the manner of his rebuke . For a respectful reprimand , Philip would not only have felt no resentment , but would have been respectful in his turn ; he would have promised to amend his ways and , at the moment he did so , he would have meant what he said , though probably he would soon have erred again . But Sotomayor 's reproof had begun like a scolding and mounted in fury until it became a veritable tongue-lashing , and it had been repeated on several occasions . Philip did not need Olivares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high degree at all times and especially so when he was addressing his sovereign . The day came when the Conde-Duque went to the Inquisitor General with two documents , bearing the signature , I THE KING , and presented them to the functionary in question with cold politeness : one was a decree of banishment ; the other was an order granting a pension of twelve thousand ducats a year , provided the beneficiary resignedfrom his present position and retired to his native city of Cordoba . Very naturally , he chose to do the latter . The new Inquisitor General , Diego de Arce , was a Benedictine friar who had long been a confidant of the Queen , and who was naturallyless disposed to view the conduct of the King with tolerance than his predecessor had done , even in the latter 's most lenient moments . He ordered that all papers in the case against Villanueva should be secured in a casket and sent to Rome in the charge of Alfonsode Paredes , one of the Council 's most trusted messengers . There was , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order ; on the other hand , it was a simple matter to delay its executionfor a few days and Paredes was invited to present himself at Velazquez ' studio , so that sketches could be made of him . " Diego wishes to use you as a model , " the Conde-Duque told Paredes smoothly . " He has been much struck by both your face and figure . He intends to give them a prominent place in one of the huge canvases on which he is presently working . You will be shown in the guise of a victorious warrior . And , since it is always necessary for Diego to make several sketches of a model when he is engaged in a major undertaking of this sort , we will send two or three of them posthaste to Italy . In this way , we shall be able to make sure that our ambassadors in Genoa and Rome and our viceroy in Naples will have no difficulty in recognizing you instantly and thus speeding your mission . " Velazquez and Paredes were both immensely pleased with the plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a model as was now so felicitously provided to use in the painting on which he had recently embarked . Paredes was flattered to be chosen for this role and still more flattered by the recognition of his mission as one of such importance . He was delighted when he landed atp186Genoa to find a delegation from the Spanish Embassy on hand to welcome him . These officials had been eagerly awaiting him , they assured him , for several days . After a convivial evening , he sank into a heavy sleep and , when he woke the next morning , the casket had disappeared from his bedside . He had no cause for concern , he was told soothingly ; it was already on its way to its destination by a messengerno less trusted than he was ; the latest orders received were that it should be thus dispatched . Meanwhile , he was to be the guest of those who had first received him until he reached the castle which had been designated as his headquarters during his stay in Italy . Philip and Olivares opened the casket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received , safe and intact , that very morning ; the kidnapers of Paredes had spoken truly when they said it had been put in the care of a messenger no less trustworthy than he was . The day was cool and a fire was burning brightly on the deep hearth under a tall marble mantel . Without even pausing to look at the papers , Philip tossed them onto the flames with his own hands and watched them blacken and curl and crumble into ashes . Then he turned to his Minister with one of his rare smiles . " If , as you assure me , Paredes has now been conveyed to Naples and confined in the stronghold of Ovo , where measures have been taken to make sure he is inaccessible , the case would seem to be closed , " the King said . " Oh , no doubt Diego de Arce and the Council will continue to importune His Holiness for a time . But to what avail ? The minutes of the trial , which declared our poor friend guilty of sacrilege , have mysteriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detractors should be satisfied in having him remain indefinitely under painless interdiction . And he is living quietly , but most comfortably , in his own convenient house . I do not think he is in the least discontented . " " There is no reason why he should be . And , as you say , there is no reason why we should not now consider the case closed and turn to other matters . " The other matters proved so pressing that , temporarily , Philip almost forgot the fact that Villanueva had never been cleared of thep187charges brought against him . These were abruptly recalled by the bad news that Villanueva had been formally arrested by the Inquisitionand taken to Toledo , where he was summoned before the judges in penitenciae ; though he was accused of no specific charges , he was told that he had sinned greatly by sacrilege and irreligionand thus merited severe punishment . In its mercy , however , the Holy Office would exact only the following penalties : for as long as he lived , he must fast on Fridays ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and he must give two thousand ducats to the Prior of Atocha to be used for charitable purposes . Chagrined that other preoccupations had made him neglectful at a time when Villanueva most needed his help , Philip gave orders that Don Jeronimo was to be released immediately and brought to him under suitable guard ; he himself would vouch that full satisfactionshould be given the judges and that the prisoner should not be freed unconditionally until Philip was confident of this . " I am sure , my dear friend , that you feel you got off very easily , " he said when the guards had been dismissed and , after a cordial greeting , he had asked Villanueva to be seated . " You are sure , Sire ? " Villanueva asked quietly , turning on the King the same sardonic gaze that had upset the Abbess during the course of their most memorable interview . " Why yes . I have restored you to your post , which is one I believe you have always enjoyed . There is no particular hardship in limiting your main course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to choose from . And , certainly , you will never miss the two thousand ducats you are to give the Prior of Atocha , a most excellentman , for his pet charity , whatever that may be . " " All this is true , Sire . But you have neglected to mention two items in the list of penalties imposed . " " That you should never again enter a convent ? That you should never again converse with a nun ? " " May I be so bold , Sire , to first answer your question with one of my own ? " " Of course . " " If those two penalties were imposed upon Your Majesty , would that represent no hardship to him ? "  |p188The  King appeared to meditate , but briefly . " If the only convent in question were San Placido , as I imagine it is in your case , the answer for me would be no , " he said . " The attraction there was of short duration . In fact , it has already caused me a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also any number of conventswhich I must visit , as a matter of courtesy , in the course of my tedious travels to Valladolid , Valencia and elsewhere . These representonly one more tiresome duty which must be fulfilled . I would gladly eliminate those from my schedule , but I know that would not be consistent with my obligations . There is , indeed , one convent which I , too , should like to visit , one nun with whom I , too , should like to speak . But the convent in question is difficult of access and does not lie within the radius of any journey which I am compelled to make . Moreover , even if I should go there , I doubt very much if the nun with whom I should like to speak would come to the locutory . In fact , I am almost certain that she would not . There is very little resemblance between her and our green-eyed novice who , I have heard indirectly , has now taken her final vows and become a very model of austerity . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , but in doing so Your Majesty seems to have dismissed the two he himself asked . I have not answered them and neither has Your Majesty . " " And you prefer that I should answer them for you ? " " Very definitely , Your Majesty . " " Then I will say that I do not think you can compare my case with yours and I am surprised that you should have done so . I assure you that no further prying inquiries will be made into your private life . As for the nun in question , I should recommend that she exercise the greatest discretion . If she does that , I am sure she has nothing to fear . "  |p193THE  news that the latest reinforcements sent to Catalunahad been defeated and that it was now completelyoverrun by the French struck Madrid like a thunderbolt . Furiously , the panic-stricken people clamored for a counter attack , unable to comprehend that Castile was now so drained of its resources that it could not finance another campaign . The nobles and gentlefolkof means were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon those who were suspected of having hoarded silver and in the capital alone more than one hundred personswere cast into dungeons because of their inability or unwillingness to meet these demands ; and , despite the passage of a law against the further manufacture and devaluation of copper currency , it was tampered with until it was reduced to a fraction of its previous value . " Yesterday , Monday , the 15th of September , the feast of St. Nicomedes the Presbyter , notice was published in Madridand in all the realm of the devaluation of the vellon , " Pellicer , the pamphleteer , wrote in his current aviso for distribution on the Liars ' ' Walks . " It is therefore necessary to face the fact that coins formerlyworth eight maravedis are now worth only three or four and those formerly worth six are worth only one . Yesterday there was great confusion and today we are hard put to find anything to eat . " Rightly or wrongly , this wretched state of affairs was laid to the door of Olivares and his personal arrogance , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hatred to the populace , now began to tell heavily against him . The Queen and the grandees , recognizing that a desperate situation called for desperate measures ,  |p194urged  the King to set an example of personal bravery by taking command of his scattered troops , with or without reinforcements ; otherwise , Cataluna would be lost forever . The satirists and pamphleteers gibed at Philip as never before , first accusing him of weakness and vacillation and then openly of cowardice . The second accusation was unjust . Philip was not without a sense of obligation , neither was he without courage , when it came to a question of physical danger ; it was self-assertion that he lacked , when Olivares was determined to restrain him and , for a time , he heeded the specious arguments marshaled against the bold step that he knew in his heart of hearts he ought to take , if he were to redeem himself before his wife , his nobles , his critics and his people . The arrival of Louis XIII on Spanishsoil finally spurred him to tardy action ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act the invader with impunity while a Spanish king lacked the initiative and the courage to defend his heritage . Philip tore up the Memorial that the Council , directed by Olivares , had drafted to oppose his departure , and announced that he was off to the front . If the Conde-Duque did not join him at Aranjuez , where he would make his first stop , he would proceedwithout his Privado ; and , having made this declaration , he galloped , fully armed , out of the palace courtyard . The immediate result of this dramatic departure was one of widespread enthusiasm and some of the murmurings against Olivares were stilled when his tardily acknowledged son organized a corps of young nobles which made a brilliant showing and set an example for other gilded youth . Money and men , which Castile could not supply , were almost miraculously forthcoming from Andalucia ; meanwhile , the Court and Clergy responded to appeals from the Queen and a new force was somehow put together to accompanythe King on his way to Aragon . Unfortunately , Olivares did not fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for delay . Widespread murmuring soon supplantedwidespread acclaim ; the King 's bold ride had come to an early end ; had it been only a ruse to raise money and men ? It was the Queen who succeeded in silencing , these murmurs by speeding the King on his way again , this time with an unwieldy but practical entourage . His next stop was to be at Ocana and he was making thisp195stage of his journey by coach . His cousin Margarita , Duchess of Mantua , the deposed vicereine of Portugal , had been visiting him and the Queen at Aranjuez and he suggested that she should keep him company on her return to the palace , which was now at her complete disposal since Don Juan had moved to the Zarzuela . She accepted the invitation for the drive with alacrity ; she had been longing for a chance to get Philip 's ear when she would not be overheard ; Olivares had always managed to advance reasons why she should not be entertained again at Madrid and there had been no opportunity for a tete-a-tete in Aranjuez . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Portugal , which she had hitherto not been able to voice , was all the more vehement because it had been so long suppressed . She poured out a story of mismanagement , duress and cruelty that came to Philip as a great shock . If Margarita had not exaggerated , it might well be too late for him to regain control of Portugal ; but he firmly resolved that , if conditionssuch as she had disclosed should also exist in Cataluna , he would not permit them to be hidden from him until it was too late to remedy them . As usual , his intentions were excellent and his fulfillment of them negligent . His progress was a leisurely one , via Cuenca to Molina and various other places which were not on the most direct route , but which afforded opportunities for pleasant visits . By the time he finally reached Zaragoza , Aragon was infested by French raiders from Cataluna and , though he occasionally reviewed troops before they left for the front , he neither saw his own army as a whole nor approached the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence in the Aragonese capital should have at least afforded an opportunity for the grandees to confer with him on the calamitous state of the country and to take counsel as to what might be done to improve it . But , when they presented themselves in a body , Olivares , who still exercised his prerogatives , refused them access to Philip and they departed in anger , proclaiming that they would yet have their revenge on the insolent upstart who , in their opinion , had made their king virtually a prisoner . As a matter of fact , it was all too true that Philip was kept almost completely isolatedon the ground that he would risk his life if he left his quarters.  |p196Richelieu  had died and this might represent at least a reprieve in the strain of relations with France ; otherwise , the news brought to him in his seclusion went from bad to worse ; and , at last , he decided to return to Madrid in the desperate hope of raising another army . During the King 's absence , Isabel had acted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , raising money , gatheringtroops , reviewing soldiers , capitalizing on the people 's pride in Baltasar Carlos and all the time further undermining the prestige of Olivares by proving herself capable of meeting situations with which he had failed to cope . This , of course , was not because she was actuallymore efficient than the experienced and hard-working Privado ; it was largely because she was increasingly beloved and he was increasinglyhated . Nor was this hatred confined any longer to the people who felt he had despoiled them . The legitimation of his son Enriquehad been a boomerang , offending his own most influential kinsmen , who had regarded themselves as his rightful heirs ; and these , together with other former friends , who were nursing grievances , joined the Queen 's faction . While Olivares was doing the King no good and much potential harm on the latter 's journey to Zaragoza , he was involuntarily playing into Isabel 's hand as he had never done before . " My efforts and my boy 's innocence must serve the King for eyes , " she announced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensconced at her side . " If he use those of the Conde-Duque 's much longer , my son will be reduced to a poor King of Castile , instead of a great King of Spain . " She was even more striking in maturity than she had been in youth . Her large black eyes were expressive as well as sparkling , her countenance was alive with intelligence . Her bearing had glamour , as well as distinction , and she had become a past mistress of dramatic appeal . Her every appearance weakened the CondeDuque'scause . On the King 's return to Madrid , she came out to meet him , magnificently dressed , and as they passed in their state coach from the Buen Retiro to the Alcazar , it seemed all too obviousto him that the blessings and cheers which rang out from every side were directed to her and not to him . He knew that he had failed . He had signed decrees drafted by Olivares , imposing upon Castile new and crushing burdens , with which to raise a fresh army . An/other " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan authorized , the seizure of all church and domestic plate enjoined and a tax of seven percent on all real property demanded . No one knew where the actual money to meet these assessments was to come from . And what was worse , Philip had not returned as a conquering hero , but as a defeated weakling , while throughout the people 's days of bitter disillusionment she had comforted them , she had cheered them , she had sustained them . They were confident that , somehow , she would continue to do so and they were voicing their trust in her . Philip was never ungenerous and , moreover , he recognized that the tribute to his wife was well deserved ; but the realization was not without bitterness . When they reached the palace , he begged Isabel to excuse him for a little while ; he was exhausted by his journey and he was deeply troubled . She would understand , he knew , that he needed to rest and to pray ; as soon as he was refreshed , he would rejoin her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave of him . It would have been better for Olivares if he had followedan equally tactful course . But the Conde-Duque , after vainly seeking reconciliation with his brother-in-law  --  whose son , the Count of Haro , was Olivares ' heir apparent  --  came stumping to the King 's private apartments with a complaint against the Gentlemen of the Chamber : in his absence they had all become his enemies ; perhaps he had really better retire , as he had so often told the King that he had long wanted to do . It was an old threat which , hitherto , had always worked to his advantage . The impassivity of Philip 's expressionand the inconclusiveness of his brief response betrayed the fact that , this time , it had failed to do so and , too late , the Conde-Duque realized that he could not have chosen a less propitious moment to intrude on the King 's weariness of both body and spirit . Olivares clumsily withdrew , hoping that when Philip , of his own accord , left his apartments , someone else might plead his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were without foundation . The first personwhom Philip met on his way to rejoin Isabel was the CondeDuque'swife , who practically waylaid him with a eulogy of her husband 's services and a detailed description of his plans for a successfulcampaign in the spring . Though Philip , with his usual cour/tesy , had permitted her to detain him , he was by this time too tired to make even a brief reply ; he bowed to her gravely and continued on his way . But , before he reached Isabel 's apartments , he was stopped again , this time by a messenger from his brother-in-law Emperor Ferdinand III , bringing more bad news and bitterly attackingOlivares . Philip dismissed the messenger , still without giving any sign of disturbance , and went on his way . When he found that Baltasar Carloswas with the Queen , his spirits momentarily lifted ; the sight of his stalwart young heir was always a source of joy . But he had hardly entered the room when Isabel , instead of giving him the cheery welcome to which he had looked forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knees beside her . " Sire , " she cried desperately . " For the sake of our child 's inheritance , if for no other reason , cast out the evil counselor who is dragging us all to ruin ! " Philip bent over , putting one arm around her and the other around their son , raising them both to their feet . " Isabel , " he said , speaking with great gentleness and a supreme attempt at restraint . " Please do n't call me Sire . Please do n't kneel to me . Surely , you do n't need to appeal to me as if you were some poor miscreant , begging for mercy , or as if you were playing a scene in a drama . Do n't let our son do it , either . " He kissed the boy , dismissed him with a smile and the reminderthat it was past the time when he should have been in Velazquez ' studio . " I know you mistrust Olivares , " Philip went on , as the boy bounded happily out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time and I 've also known that you hated him as an interloper between you and me before you had any reason to distrust him as a minister . I 've known that both my brothers shared your feeling . At first , I did n't agree with you . I thought he was a wise counselor , as well as a great administrator . I knew he was much more capable of outlining and enforcing policies and making decisions for the good of the country than I was . He 's a much more powerful man . But , lately , I 've had my doubts about him , too . I 've learned that his capacity for conceiving large-scale projects is much greater than his capacity for seeing them through . I 've also learned that some of hisp199counseling has been unwise and that some of his deeds have been evil , that he was willing to sacrifice almost everything to his passion for power , even justice and mercy . Moreover , I 've come to have a very high opinion of your judgment . " " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been considering it very seriously , but I keep putting it off . Partly because I ca n't help feeling sorry for him . " " Sorry for him ! " " Yes . He is n't well . I mean , quite aside from his lameness . His shoulders are burly as ever , but have n't you noticed his eyes ? They used to be his dominating feature . Now they 're still observant , but they 're lackluster . And his cheeks are sunken . I suppose he 's lost his teeth , as well as his hair , and that 's why he wears a great sweeping mustache and a shaggy wig . " " None of this makes me feel sorry for him . It only makes me feel he 's more repulsive than ever . " Philip sighed again . " Well , there 's another reason why I hesitate to dismiss him . If I do , who 'll take his place ? Oh , I know you will say that we do not want anyone to take his place and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . . . I am not capable of governing this kingdomsingle-handed , you know that , Isabel , as well as I do . Just now , as I told you a few hours ago , I am so tired and discouraged that I am not sure of thinking very clearly . That was why I asked you to excuse me while I rested and prayed . Well , I have prayed and I have tried to rest  --  not very successfully . So I thought I would give up trying to make important decisions for tonight and spend the rest of the evening pleasantly with you . But perhaps , after all , it would be better if I retired to pray some more . " Isabel did not try to detain him , as he had half-hoped she would ; but he was apparently fated to have his passage through the corridors of the Alcazar interrupted , if not by a countess , then by an imperial messenger and , if not by an imperial messenger , then by someone else whom he could not gainsay . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not seen in a long while , for though Olivareshad raised no objection to her temporary attendance on Ines on the occasion of Don Juan 's birth , he had later taken steps to ensureher permanent removal from Court . She had been buxom andp200comely as a young matron ; now she was a mere wisp of a woman and Philip was so startled when he came upon her in the semi-obscuritythat he did not recognize her instantly . It took him a moment to collect himself and he did not even have a chance to ask her how she had managed to return , surreptitiously , to the palace when , like the Queen , she cast herself on her knees before him . " Sire , " she cried , with even greater vehemence than Isabel . " I implore you to listen to me ! " " Of course , I will listen to you , Ana , " he said patiently . " What is it you want to tell me ? " " What you do not seem to know : that the looms are idle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why ? Because one wicked man is bent on destroying the nation . The people have long endured their misery without complaint , but now they are starving . Much as they love you , they can bear no more . They will rise against you and your wife and your children , unless you free them from this evil monster 's oppression . " Philip knew she was exaggerating , but he had reached the breaking point . He raised Ana to her feet , as he had Isabel , but he did not remonstrate with her for kneeling to him , as he had with his wife . Neither did he try to reason with her or explain anything to her or give any sign of the affection he had always felt for her . Instead , he said , abruptly , " I 'm afraid you are right , " and , turning on his heel , left her and hurried down the long corridor , obsessed with the fear that he might again be detained and importuned . After a sleepless night , in which prayer had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably the most effective way to prevent any more scenes would be to leave the Alcazar altogether and , at dawn , he called for a horse and galloped rapidly out to the Pardo , his favorite hunting lodge , and quickly arranged for a day in the woods . Before he picked up his gun , however , he seized a scrap of paper and wrote hurriedly : CONDE-DUQUEYouhave often asked for permission to retire and I have not chosen to grant your request . Now I do . You may go wherever you wish with due regard for your health and need of repose. -I THE KING.  |p201EVERYTHING  that happened within the next few days had a quality not only of anticlimax , but of unreality to Philip . When he returned to the Alcazar , he found awaiting him an urgentrequest from Isabel : would he please come to her as soon as he conveniently could ? After a long day in the open and a good night 's sleep , he felt infinitely better ; without any sense of strain or dread , he hastened to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already finished her morning chocolate and begun to busy herself with accounts . She looked up with a smile and motioned to a seat beside her . " Margarita is here , " she said . " She 's eager to see you . " " Margarita ? " For a moment , he was puzzled . It often seemed to him that every girl baby who was not christened Isabel or Maria must be christened Margarita , there were so many women by that name . " Yes . Your cousin . The Duchess of Mantua . " " Really ? I had no idea she was planning to make us a visit . Is anything wrong at Ocana ? " " No , I do n't think so . Of course , she is perpetually short of money . And she would much rather live in Madrid . " " Well , she is not the only person who is short of money . And I suppose , if she is really discontented in Ocana , we can provide suitableaccommodations here . Is that all ? " " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Philip made a gesture of impatience . " Why , just now ? "  | " Because she could n't very well do it while you were in Aragon and you 've been home only two days . " " Exactly . So I have plenty of other things to do at the moment . I 'll look at her documents later on . I suppose she has some more disclosuresabout irregularities in Portugal , for which she blames Oli-vares . " " Yes . As I said , she claims they 're very important , that if you could only see them  --  " Again , Philip made a gesture of impatience . " Have her hand them over to you . I 'll look at them when I have time . just now , I have all I can do without reading old documents . I expect to be rather busy these next few days . You will be glad to know that , before I went into the woods yesterday , I wrote a brief note to the Conde-Duque , giving him leave to retire . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never was more so . I might have given a little more thought to the matter and stood out against you a little longer if Ana de Guevara had n't made an appeal , quite as dramatic as yours , when I was trying to go and get some rest . Also , if the Condesa herself , as well as the Conde-Duque , had n't stopped me in the corridor , with all sorts of explanations and complaints . I began to think I could n't walk around my own palace without being waylaid . That 's what finally drove me out to the Pardo . But now I 'm feeling better  --  enough better to face most things , but not another wailing woman . ... There , " he added hastily , " I did n't mean to speak unkindly . " " I did n't think you meant to be unkind . And you wo n't have to worry about being waylaid by the Countess , today anyhow . She 's gone to Loeches . " " Oh ! Then perhaps that 's why Olivares is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live in and he 's sent her to see that it was put in order . He did waylay me again early this morning , repeatingeverything he said day before yesterday . Not that it did him any good . . . . Well , let 's not talk about it any more . The next thing I must do is to prepare a statement for the Council . I 'll draft it right now . Perhaps you can help me with it . " He selected a blank sheet from the stack Isabel had in readiness and wrote rapidly . Once the statement was prepared , he began top203feel better , though he did not intend to use it until the Conde-Duque had actually left for Loeches . Philip decided to spend the day more or less in seclusion , recovering from strain ; and Isabel 's assurance that the Condesa had gone to Loeches led him to believe that the " wailing woman " whom he most dreaded to see was out of the way . Under the circumstances , it should be safe for him to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was accustomed to do unattended , and he moved quickly along the corridor which led to their rooms . Unfortunately , his cool reception of the Conde-Duque early that morning had already brought about unwelcome results : Olivareshad sent off a message , posthaste , to his wife , urging her return ; he had failed to recover lost ground , but perhaps she would be more successful . Considering her previous experience , two days earlier , his credulity would have been amazing were it not so plainly permeatedwith desperation ; but she showed no more discernment than he had . Leaving her dinner untouched , she hurried back to Madrid and rushed to the Alcazar , where she again accosted the King before he could take refuge in the schoolroom . This time , had it not been for a supreme effort of will on his part , he would have bade her be gone in no uncertain terms . As it was , with cutting politeness , he asked her to excuse him and went on his way . But she still would not , or could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Queen 's apartments on the chance that Isabel might not yet have joined her husband , though why she should have thought for a moment that Isabel would be in a forgiving mood , the latter was at a loss to understand ; she had suffered too long under the meddling tyranny of the Condesa , when she herself was an inexperiencedgirl , a stranger in a strange land , to feel any pity for her now . The Queen 's cold reply , overheard by Ana de Guevara , became a byword , " What God , the people and evil happenings have done , Condesa , neither the King nor I can undo . " Directly and indirectly , the discredited couple pursued their tactless and insistent course , refusing to be persuaded that , by so doing , they were laying themselves open to harsher measures against them than had so far been used or even contemplated . Convinced at last that his wife would never succeed as an intermediary , the Conde-Duque next decided to try his luck with his nephew , Donp204Luis de Haro , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his tardily recognized illegitimate son . Quite as if he were still in a position to give orders , Olivares summoned Don Luis to the Buen Retiro , which he had not yet left himself ; and when the young man obediently appeared , his uncle reminded him that , though in some ways he might have been deprived of his rights , much had been done for him by bringing him to Court from his father 's remote country seat and thereby opening the way to riches and power . Now it was his turn to grant favors . Don Luis was stunned ; it would no more have occurred to him that he might have more influence with the King than his ruthless and powerful kinsman than it would have occurred to him that he might profitably covet the crown itself . Cautiously , he replied that he did not know if the King would be disposed to receive him ; apparently , His Majesty was very tired after his long journey and preferred to be spared as many audiences as possible ; but he , Luis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would do what he could . This was typical of the attributes which had won for him the nickname of el Discreto , that was to say , the average man , neither too refined nor too coarse , too bold nor too timid . It so happened that Philip was perfectly willing to see Don Luis , whose " average " qualities he appreciated ; he was beginning to think that the Conde-Duque 's insistence actually had amusing aspects . He listened with unfeigned interest to the long list of expensive gifts and pensions which Olivares wanted the King to bestow on Olivares ' servants , and said he would be glad to authorize them , though he was well aware that the Privado had long been enjoying an incomeof half a million a year and could well afford to make such provisions himself . Don Luis was also so aware of this that he suddenlyfound himself tongue-tied ; he could not go on to the extent of asking personal favors for his uncle . Instead , he permitted himself to give answers to a few direct questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister . While Olivares and his wife continued to besiege the palace , word that their fall was imminent gradually seeped through its walls to the Liars ' Walks . But , at first , the news was received incredulously ; it was simply too good to be true . The people 's disbelief was notp205without basis , for Olivares still stubbornly refused to leave the capital . According to him , transportation represented difficulties ; so did the state of his health ; so did the necessity of seeing all his servitors well provided for ( though Don Luis had taken care of that ) . The Conde-Duque did not surrender his keys until they were demanded and humbled himself by going to a public audience . There , rather than create a scene , the King conversed with him briefly ; but even those who were not within earshot knew that nothing had been gained by this final attempt at an interview . When Olivares left the audience chamber , leaning heavily on the crutch which was no longer credited with magic powers , tears of chagrin were running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to compose a fresh crop of squibs and lampoons which were passed from hand to hand and posted in public places and the boldest one of all was actuallypinned on the palace gate . Great crowds gathered in the square before the Alcazar , shouting , " We have a king again , we have a king again ! " and when the King and Queen , with the Duchess of Mantua , went abroad in the royal coach , the people surged around them with joyous cries , " Our King at last ! God save the King ! " And still the Conde-Duque lingered . Philip had no wish to humiliate his Minister by a public display of irritation , but his patience was very sorely tried . At last he decided that it would , perhaps , be better for him to go hunting again , this time at the Escorial . Isabel , who recognized his need for release , refrained from sending him word that the Condesa had again managed to reach her with a tearful complaint , so he was not disturbedon that score . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , as he left San Lorenzo , he was met by a delegation of nobles , headed by Melchor Borja , who told him they had come to put themselves and all their worldly possessions at his disposal . They had long stood aloof ; now that he was once more their king , they would be his until death . He returned to Madrid a much happier man than he had left it and was relieved to find that , though Olivares was still at the Buen Retiro , it was at last evident that he was making preparations for departure . The Conde-Duque left the palace secretly , by means of ap206service stairway , and drove off in a coach with drawn curtains , attended by only four persons . It was an ignominious ending to a grandiose career . When the news came that he had actually gone , Philip called a meeting of his Council and read them the statement which he had prepared a few days earlier : For a long while , the Conde-Duque has been asking permission to retire , as he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions . I have delayed as long as possible because of the affection in which I hold him , and because of my great confidence in him , the result of proven zeal , love , purity and dedication over many years . Yet , taking into account the insistence with which he has lately repeated his request , I have chosen to grant it . . . . He has already departed . . . . I still hope that , with peace and quiet , he may recover his strength and return to my service . On this occasion , it behooves me to inform the Council that , for the lack of so good a minister , no one will replace him but myself ... . May Our Lord enlighten me and guide me ... . Though this statement was , of course , courteously received by the Council , the courtesy was , inevitably , permeated with scepticism , on several counts . Almost nobody considered that the CondeDuque'srole had been one of " zeal , love , purity and dedication " and almost nobody believed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this disbelief was coupled the fear that Olivares would indeed be permitted to return to the service of the King or that the new privado , whoever that might be , would represent a change for the worse . The continued presence of the Condesa at Court remained a source of irritation , for she managed to cling to her position as Mistressof the Robes and , though Isabel deeply resented this , Philip was now inclined to let matters slide . It was the Duchess of Mantua who finally brought them to a head when a dispute arose regarding precedence . The Condesa had never relinquished her claim to a place in the royal coach and she might have kept it had it not been that she and Margarita were not of the same opinion as to which place this should be . Isabel managed to placate the warring ladies and thep207outing continued with a compromise ; but a few days later , when the coach was surrounded by a crowd that shouted , " Long live the Queen and down with the Condesa ! " the King decided that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . The Condesa was instructed to follow her husband into retirement . Philip was trying very hard to do his best . He faithfully attendedall meetings of the Council and dispatched urgent business promptly and efficiently . He wrote decrees and other state papers with his own hand . He rose early and began to give audiences by seven in the morning . Gradually , the scepticism of the nobles abated ; perhaps this was , after all , " their king at last " and none of them questionedthat Isabel was their queen ; misgivings on that score had ceased long before . But a general feeling persisted that the King did not realize how much he , as well as the people , owed her . On this point , also , came a welcome surprise . Regular visits to the Convent of the Descalzas Reales were still a habit with the King and Queen and both were accustomed , in the course of these visits , to ask the Community for special prayers . However , in view of Philip 's positive statement that no one was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Philip closed some informal remarks to the nuns with the requestthat they would commend the new privado to God , " in order that His light might shine on the government . " The Sisters silently exchanged glances ; then one of them , bolder than the others , ventured to ask His Majesty for whom this special prayer was intended . " My new privado is the Queen , " he replied . And , dropping on one knee , he kissed her hand.  |p213And  now , how much further to Agreda ? " " Not more than a league or so , Sire . " " There have been days when we have gone no further than that from sunrise to sunset . And it is my hope that we may cross the provincialfrontier from Castile into Aragon before nightfall . However , if we are late in reaching Agreda or if we are detained there longer than I expect , that will be impossible . " " We shall not be late in reaching Agreda , Sire . And we need be detained there no longer than Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed . " " True , but they may be kept to the minimum . " The King sighed , without answering , and the second speaker , Don Luis de Haro , true to his role of el Discreto , saw no point in pursuing the question , though word had already reached them that town and gown were preparing special festivities in honor of the royal visit . By his own fatigue , he could easily gauge the King 's and the latter 's longing to reach the end of their travels . It was more than five weeks since they had left Madrid for Zaragoza and the journey , over rough roads , even though it had been made in a superb state coach , lined in crimson brocade and provided with a couch on which the King could recline , instead of having been made on horseback , had been a hard one . Indeed , Don Luis was disposed to think that the other method would have been easier as well as quicker ; unfortunately , that was contrary to the rules of etiquette , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with equerries and outriders and a suitable suite , though in this instancep214the size of the suite had been greatly reduced . Simplicity , like economy , according to Philip , was now to be the order of the day . Don Luis would have been perfectly content if the retrenchment were such that he need not be included among those chosen to accompanythe King , especially as there had never previously been such prolonged stops at all the convents , monasteries and churches along the way : Alcala de Henares  --  Guadalajara  --  Siguenza  --  Medinaceli  --  Almazan  --  Tajahuercedel Campo  --  Villar del Campo ; pompous bishops  --  drowsy priors  --  garrulous abbesses  --  it seemed the prayers of all these were needed for the remission of His Majesty'ssins and the redemption of prostrate Spain ! Luis de Haro shrugged his shoulders . If every time the King committed adultery  --  and , despite his pallor and his languor , he must be possessed of extraordinaryvirility  --  the prayers of the faithful were to be elicited , they would have time for nothing else . If the defenders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Rocroy  --  those world famous tercios  --  were not powerful enough to end the long siege of the one and prevent the crushing defeat of the other , how could it be hoped that the mumbling patter of cloistered monks would have more effect ? And then there had been that inexplicable change of plan after leaving Guadalajara . Don Luis knew that the King had intended to make the Convent of Valfermoso de las Monjas , near Utande , one of his stops ; and there had been much speculation among his attendantsas to what this might portend , and a good many whispered opinions and surreptitious winks , not to mention wagers , had been exchanged . Although fourteen years had passed since la Calderona had insisted on the rupture of her relations with the King , despite his vehement and brokenhearted protests , and had entered a convent in the remote Badiel Valley , none of them had forgotten her charm , her grace , her gentleness . She was only a little past thirty now  --  in short , she should barely have reached the zenith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luis and the others to believe that , in seekingher out , the King intended to ask only for her prayers . Oh , doubtless , the visit would begin correctly enough ! As Philip himself put it , the traditional courtesies must be observed . The nun  --  two nuns  --  would be on one side of the grille and the King , with an at/tendant nobleman , on the other . But Philip would soon find a pretextfor dismissing both her companion and his ; then he would give her news of their son , the namesake of the King 's famous great-uncle , Don Juan of Austria : such a promising boy , so handsome , so intelligent , so manly that everyone in the palace of the Zarzuela , where he was established in princely fashion , was loud in his praises . After assuring her of the boy 's welfare and progress , the King would go on to describe the ceremony which had taken place when their Don Juan , at the age of twelve , was brought to Madrid and , by decree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the son of Charles V. Sor Dolores  --  was that what she called herself now ?  --  could not help but be moved by such a recital ; and , when His Majesty told her that he would require lodging for the night , for himself and his attendants , could she refuse to give it to him ? To be sure , she was not another Sor Margarita , who must have been a hussy at heart or she would have found a way , with the help of her abbess , to make herself inaccessible to the King , despite the tunnel leading from Villanueva 's basement to the cloister of San Placido . There had never been anything of the hussy about la Calderona . The King had been her one and only love , as Don Luis himself and a number of others who had tried in vain to prevail against her chastitycould testify ; and she had loved the King as a man and not as a monarch . But had she ever ceased to love him , despite her flight and her vows and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the hands of Giovanni Battista Pamfili , the PapalNuncio ? Had the King ever ceased to love her , despite his weakness and his profligacy and his futility ? Don Luis did not think so and neither did any of the others . And , when the King and Sor Dolores came face to face again , after those years of separationwhen they had continued to yearn for each other , who could blame them if the exchange of glances were followed by an exchange of embraces ? Certainly not Don Luis . He awaited the stop at Utande with eager anticipation ; there , at least , would be a change and a break in the monotony of this cursed progress . And then , what had happened ? They had passed Trijueque , where the King had insisted on stopping long enough to inspect the fortifications and had begun the descent into the deep Badiel Valleyp216on a late June day so beautiful that it seemed impossible to think of this region as one that was stark and grim . All the foothills of the Alcarria Range were clothed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , except where they were already golden with wheat which would soon be ripe for harvesting ; and hills and valleysalike were bathed in the resplendency of a sun which hung like a great ball in a sky as blue as lapis lazuli . This sky was cloudless and the soft air , fragrant with the scent of lavender , was crystal clear . Suddenly , far beneath them , the little village toward which they were headed came into sight as the King 's carroza swung around a bend in the curving road  --  a little village which , in its essential attributes , was no different from hundreds of other Castilian villages , with small clustering houses , red roofed , low built , brown walled ; but which , somehow , seemed to have a quality all its own , because it was so enfolded by its hills and so glorified by the light which shone on it . It seemed permeated with a peace that was not of this world , almost as if it were an inviolable sanctuary . And when the carroza came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maneuver , and it now stood too close to the precipitous edge for safety , the King alighted and , for some moments , stood silently looking down at the village below them with his courtiers respectfully grouped around him , silent also . Then , without any word to explain his action , the King commanded that the carroza should go forward no further than to the first place where it would be safe to turn it around and , after that , they were to regain the high road and to go on to Sigiienza , where they were to be the guests at the Episcopal palace . They were not to pause long enough even to feast on the famous honey of the region . That was several days ago and the King had made no reference since to his change of plan , nor had any of the others in his hearing , though plenty had been said when he was out of earshot . It was never easy to guess the King 's thoughts ; ever since his father 's death , his face had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he chose to keep it that way and , increasingly , he was a man of few words . But it was not hard to guess that la Calderona  --  or Sor Dolores , if that was what she called herself now  --  had won again , as she had when she had flung herself at Philip 's feet , after the birth ofp217their son , and begged his leave to let her go , so that she who had the honor of bearing the King 's son might henceforth lead a blameless life . He had tried to break her will then , for he not only still desired her greatly , he loved her , if not as truly as she loved him , then at least as truly as it was in him to love any woman ; and he had been powerless to do so . Now something had told him that he would again be powerless , that his sojourn at Utande would be one of defeatand sorrow and unappeased yearning . Or had something else happened ? When he alighted from the crimson-lined carroza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a waxen face , had that glimpse he had had of a sheltered spot , which his love believed a safe sanctuary , moved him so deeply that he found he could not go on ? The others were never to know . Siguenza and the most tedious visit of any were behind them now and so were Medinaceli and Almazan , where they had stayed at seignorial houses for a change . After Agreda there was only Tarazona , where they would cross into Aragon and Borja , the ancestral house of Aragon 's viceroy , whose family had a way of producing saintly figures as well as shrewd statesmen ; and then , at last , they would be in Zaragoza , able to enjoy urban delights with the King 's own palace as their headquarters . If only Agreda could have been omitted , there was no doubt that they could have passed over the boundary line that evening ; but , if it were true that the populace were turning out in full force , that a special service were to be held at the Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that . Even before they were in sight of Agreda , Don Luis knew that his last hope was gone . The bells of all the churches were ringingand sounds of jubilation rose from the streets . The people , whose acquaintance with the King had hitherto been limited to a profile on the coin of the realm and the seals used on documents associated with tax collecting and conscription for military service , could hardly believe that he was actually in their midst , not only as the Lord 's Anointed , but as a man of flesh and blood . They had formed processions , they were waving olive branches , they were singing in chorus and shouting huzzahs . Their excitement was understandable . Agreda had not previously been chosen as a halting place for a royalp218cortege . It was not a cathedral town and the Convent of the Concepcionistaswas not one established by royal grant ; it was merely the outgrowth of a pious neighborly unit which had , at first , been quartered in the ancestral home of the Coronel family and gradually expanded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coronel 's daughter Maria , who was the present abbess . And , now that he thought of it , Don Luis wondered if there were not something he had heard about this woman which might have been a determining factor in the King 's decision to stop at Agreda . To all intents and purposes , the visit was one of routine and the King , with characteristic taciturnity , had not given the slightest indication that it might be otherwise . But , tardily , Don Luis began to remember rumors he had heard concerning this abbess : about the rigidity with which she ruled ; about the books she had written , some of which had met with disfavor from the Holy Inquisition ; about her great learning and mystic powers , including that of bilocation , with which she was credited , and which could not be explainedthrough natural laws . Now that all this came to mind , Don Luis thought he remembered that his uncle , the Conde-Duque , who had fallen from favor only a few months before , after enjoying years of supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itinerary  --  in fact , had gone so far as to insist on a change after it was actually planned . Whether this was because such a visit might intensify Philip 's interest in mysticism  --  an interest which he had inherited from his father , to whom it had become an obsession ; or whether it might mean another tangle with the Inquisition , when the one precipitated by the scandal at San Placido had been quite enough ; or whether it was merely an aversion to the unnecessarydelay caused by a superfluous visit at an unimportant center , Luis did not know . But he thought very possibly Philip was now seizing an occasion  --  as he had done several times already  --  to show that he was no longer king only in name , that he was his own master . And perhaps the very fact that he had refrained from stopping at Utande had increased his determination to find what support and solace were available elsewhere . The carroza lumbered through the streets and came to a stop before the Church of the Immaculate Conception , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumors of a royal visit had reached the nuns , they had been busily at work ; they had practiced songs , they had polished ornaments , they had prepared candles , they had gathered flowers . Now , in the lighted church where the fragranceof the roses mingled with the aroma of the incense , they peered through the grille as they reverently began to sing the Te Deum , resentful that it obscured their view of the King 's black-clad figure as he knelt , his pale face resting on his clasped hands . Only his reverence and his absorption were fully revealed . Like the people in the streets , who had acclaimed him with olive branches , the nuns wanted to see the man as a human figure  --  not because they associatedhim with coins and tax collectors , but because they associated him with Sor Margarita , whose story had , of course , been the more widely spread the greater the attempt to suppress it . Would any of them be admitted to the locutory when the King paid his respects to the Abbess ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And then , what next ? Considering Sor Maria 's severity , there was not much to hope for  --  or much to fear . The nuns bowed their heads and acceptedvirginity with mingled regret and thanksgiving . The same dignitaries of Church and State who had awaited the King at the portal of the church on his arrival , now waited to escort him to the locutory after the service was over . He was to enter it alone , for the Abbess was not to receive him with the grille between them , but as any great lady would have welcomed a distinguished visitor ; and only a king could have this privilege in a cloistered convent . As the latch was lifted , the door opened quietly from within and he heard the murmured greeting , " Ave Maria Purissima , " with which visitors were automatically welcomed , and made the standardizedanswer , " Sin peccavi conceptiva , " even before he saw a graceful figure , enveloped in a blue cloak , and veiled with black . He took a step forward and bowed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sor Maria . " " As I am honored by your visit , Sire . " " Will you not be seated ? " " I feel it would not be seemly to sit in my sovereign 's presence . " " Then I can only say that I shall remain standing as long as you do . "  | " In that case , Sire , you give me no choice . " Drawing the folds of her cloak around her , she seated herself on a stool , at the same time indicating that the King should take the chair which had been her father 's favorite , the one in which she had often seen him seated at ease , in the quiet of the evening , readingfrom his Book of Devotions . She had brought it with her when she moved from his family house , the only other one she had ever known , to the convent ; and she had seen it used , hundreds of times now , by visitors to the locutory . But , hitherto , when that had happened , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitor on the other . There were no bars to separate her from this one . In fact , there was not even distance ; the locutory was small , as well as bare ; either , by stretching out a hand , could have touched the other . " And now , Sor Maria , if you would further honor me by raisingyour veil . " It had not occurred to her that he would ask her to do this and she hesitated , for no man had seen her face these many years now ; even in the confessional , she was hidden . But this was the King , and she must obey him , as long as no order that he gave her did violence to her vows . Thoughtfully , she reviewed these and could remember nothing that forbade her to do as he asked . Meanwhile , he waited without any show of impatience , for her to reveal the countenance which , even without seeing it , he felt sure would promise so much . Slowly she raised both hands and lifted her long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beneath it was another , black also , but sheer and shorter than the first and , until she raised this , too , he could not see her features clearly . Then he looked on a face of almostperfect oval , the chin firmly but delicately molded , the beautifullyshaped lips meeting each other without pressure . The skin was exquisite , its pallor tinged with a faint rose that seemed to come from some inner glow that illumined both spirit and body , rather than from mere natural coloring . But dominating every other feature were the eyes : large , dark , wise , compassionate , all-seeing . They met the King 's gaze steadily and , as they did so , they softenedmore and more and yet , at the same time , it was strength , not weakness , that they showed him  --  the strength of which he was sop221desperately in need . The mask fell from his own face , revealing it in all its anguish , all its remorse  --  and all its weakness . " I have come to you , Sor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Without your help I shall be lost and , with me , my king-dom. "  |p222AS  the King spoke , he leaned forward in his chair , twisting his clasped hands in anguish . Sor Maria , whose hands were folded calmly in her lap , under her scapular , resistedthe impulse to tighten them and spoke quietly . " Help must come from the Omnipotent , Sire , as you know . I could only be His instrument , if such were His Will . What leads you to think that I might be ? " " Everything about you . " " But everything ' could be compassed in such a small space ! What have I done to justify such confidence ? " " It is not what you have done or left undone . It is what you are . " And what am I ? The foundress of a small secluded convent in a provincial town . Your Majesty has been in close touch , all his life , with the sumptuous Convent of the Descalzas Reales in Madrid , whose foundress was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fourth Duke of Gandia , husband of Leonor de Castro , who entered Holy Orders after her death , became confessorat the Descalzas Reales ; and three of his relatives have been its abbesses ; his great-grandson is your friend , Don Fernando Manuel de Borja y Aragon , Viceroy of Aragon . Is not the Superior of this convent Your Majesty 's logical spiritual adviser if you seek for some abbess to supplement the counsel of your eminent confessor ? " " No . The Convent of the Descalzas Reales means nothing to me except the place where I was taken by a drab churchman , when I was a little boy , to attend dull ceremonies , the only respite of/fered me from prayers and lessons , and the place to which I am now required , by etiquette , to make royal visits . " " But , if I 'm not mistaken , Your Majesty did perform in masques with courtiers of your own age , in which you took delight and showed great talent , as you did in the declamation of verses beforethe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that you are well informed , Sor Maria . If such details as these are known to you , there must be many others of greater weight on which you could pass judgment . Let me say that , as a rule , the masques and recitations were few and far between and that there were no other outings with boys of my own age  --  no games , no contests , no healthful sports . " " Your Majesty was married very young to a most charming princess . It is my understanding that she was a gay playfellow for you and that , since then , she has shared your tastes for pleasure , besidesshowing herself a wise regent in those periods like the present one when Your Majesty himself is , perforce , absent from Court . " " That also is true . Spain is more blessed in her queen than in her king . And , as I said before , you are very well informed . So doubtlessyou know that the Conde-Duque stimulated those pleasures by giving the Queen and myself the Buen Retiro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sire . " " And that he is now in retirement ? " " Yes , Sire . " " And that this retirement was not entirely voluntary ? " " Again , I must say yes , Sire . " " Did you form an opinion as to whether or not this retirement was well or ill advised ? " " I believe it was well advised . The Conde-Duque had once been a pillar of great strength to Your Majesty . But , gradually , he had become a crushing weight both to Your Majesty and to your people . " " And since he has ceased to give me support , have you felt that any other has given it to me , except my wife ? " " No , Your Majesty . "  | " Then why should you be surprised that I ask your help and ask it desperately ? " " Because again I must inquire of you , Sire , what moves you to believe I can give you help ? By my prayers , yes , but those you have without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject in your realm . " " It is not only your prayers which I am beseeching . It is also your counsel . I have often heard it said that , if a man wishes to know what is happening in the world , he should go to a convent . I have sometimes doubted the truth of that old saw . I shall do so no longer . You know my story and , doubtless , that of my father and my grandfather , not to mention that of my present family , my advisers , my loves , my people . And , knowing them , you have given thought to them and formed opinions about them . You are a thoughtful woman . " " For the sake of argument , let us assume that is so . But that does not prove that these thoughts and opinions would be of constructivehelp . I know your story , yes , and the story of those who surround you and those who preceded you , but that does not mean I am qualified to comment on them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no acquaintance with a world like yours . In all my life I have not left Agreda . Even my girlhood dream of becoming a Carmelite , of taking the habit in the Convent of Santa Ana of Tarazonawhich , as Your Worship knows , is only a few leagues from here , came to nothing . For my mother also had a dream  --  a vision : I was not to leave my home . My father and my brothers would leave it , to become Franciscan friars ; but she and I would remain there and , joined by friends , form our own Community . It was only some years later that this was formalized , by papal decree , and that we raised the wherewithal to build this convent , in which we have had the honor to receive Your Majesty . I left my first home for this , my second one . I have never been anywhere else , not even to Tarazona . " " Sor Maria , are you sure ? " For the first time , the King , who was watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so slightly , before they veiled the great luminous eyes ; and the glow in the pale cheeks becamedeeper when she spoke . Moreover , she did not answer with thep225same immediacy that had marked her speech whenever he paused before . " I asked you , Sor Maria , if you were sure ? " he repeated , more impellingly . " I am awaiting your answer . " " Since you require it of me , Sire , I must tell you that I am not  --  altogether sure . " " Ah ! And , in that case , where is it that you have been ? " " To the New World . " " To the New World ! And still you were almost sure that you had never been as far away as Tarazona ! You could hardly have crossed seas and continents without knowing it . " Again she made no immediate answer . " Could you ? " he insisted . " No , " she murmured at last . " But I did not go to the New World as I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go ? " " It was Our Lord Who transported me , " she said , still almost in a whisper . " After I had eaten the Bread of Angels , I felt myselfgently lifted above the pavement where I knelt and wafted away , with the softness of a breeze and the swiftness of light . I was transportedover cities , mountains , seas , deserts . I heard sounds which seemed , at first , only those of confusion , a babel of tongues ; and then I knew that Arabic , Greek , the dialects of Africa were coming to my ears . I saw the heathen of China , men whose faces were the color of ivory and whose silken garments were embroidered with birds and flowers . I saw Mohammedans with dark skins , burning eyes and sensual lips , who dwell on the false promise of celestial delightsin the form of fleshly pleasures . I saw the naked idolators of the Indies , their copper-colored foreheads adorned with feathers . I had eagerly read many books about the conquest of the Indies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had succeeded in adding the jewels of the Aztecs and the Incas to the crown of Spain and that , since then , the dream of El Dorado has been realized . Also , that the same galleons which have brought back gold to us have taken the truth which is the treasure of the Church to the lands which have yielded us their treasures . But a century has not been enough to change idolatry into Christianity ; though on every voyagep226our priests have accompanied our military and many missions have been founded , still there have not been enough to do the Lord 's work . So I petitioned that I might have some small part in this , through my prayers . And then one day the golden cloud in which I had traveled came to rest on the earth and I saw that I was in an Indian village . " " Can you tell me about this village , Sor Maria ? " the King asked gently . " Yes . " Now that she had begun , now that she had taken him into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . " It was not like our villages . There were no houses made of stone or brick , no roofs of dark blue slate or bright red tile . There were no belfries where a stork could build its nest , no latticed balconies . There were only round huts made of verdant reeds and roofed with yellow straw and the entrances to these were draped with brightcoloredcotton blankets , woven in complicated designs . And , overhead , the sky was bluer and clearer than ours and seemed nearer to the earth than it is at Agreda ; and the air was stiller and softer and perfumed with the scent of fruits and flowers unknown to me . " " You certainly saw this village very clearly , Sor Maria . What about its people ? " " A small shabby child , whose bare shoulders shone in the sun like copper , and who was preparing bird lime , was apparently the first who saw my descent and my emergence from the golden cloud . He cried out and ran , straight as an arrow , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he thought he had reason to believe that he was about to be bitten by a poisonous snake or snatched up and carried away by a condor . The Indian woman , half naked and disheveled , came through the small door of her hut and approached me slowly . Then she fell on her knees before me , as if she had been dazzled by something in my appearance . The child meanwhile had rushed off toward a great bronze gong decorated with crude designs that stood near by and had struck it frantically with a wooden hammer . Instantly , all the men in the village came dashing to the spot , shouting in the strange guttural tongue which is their language . "  | " Did they threaten you ? " " No , never . " " Never ? So you went to this village more than once ? " Again she hesitated , but this time it seemed to be less because she was unwilling to inform him than because she feared she might not do so correctly . " As nearly as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a hundred times , " she said at last . " And it was always in the same way that I have described to you . I was transported by Our Lord . " " And you were always made welcome ? " " Always . In their language , the Indians asked me who I was and I told them , speaking in ours , and we always understood each other . Then they asked me why I had come and I told them  --  to tell them the story of Our Lord . For I knew that my prayers had been answered , though not in the way I expected , but that is often the way with prayers . My apostleship was not to find fulfillment in my cell , but in the Indians ' village . " " You say they understood you and you them ? " " Always . That is , I always understood them and they always understood my words . It was not so easy for them to grasp the meaning of salvation 's story . How could they , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that territory , though not in the village where Our Lord sent me . So the chief of the village and the medicine men of the tribe went to the Mission and asked them to send them a friar , so that they would understand better . Your Majesty will remember that there was much ground to cover and few workers in the field ; so the Superior was not instantly able to do as the Indians asked and they went again . When they persisted , he asked them why they were so importunate and they said it was because of what the lady in blue had told them . " The King 's eyes traveled slowly from the Abbess ' face to her habit and lingered there . " The lady in blue , of course , was you , Sor Maria , " he said quietly . " I do not see how I can doubt it . They even drew a picture , a very lifelike picture of me , from memory , and showed it to the Su/perior . It was correct in all its details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of very few Orders is blue . At the moment , I can think of only one other , that of the Desamparadoras , and the cut of their garmentsis very different from ours . " Suddenly , there was silence in the room . Protocol prevented the Abbess from speaking again until the King addressed her and he seemed content to sit as they were , facing each other but not speaking , and this though shadows were beginning to fall and soon they would be engulfed in darkness as well as silence . The King would not be able to cross the frontier into Aragon before nightfall , unless he left at once and yet he seemed to have no disposition to leave . At last , he lifted his head , which had been bent over his breast while the stillness lasted , and looked at the lady in blue , not with anguish , as he had at first or with grave eagerness , as he had later , but with a thoughtful smile . " You have set me to wondering , Sor Maria . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not believe my story ? " " Of course , I believe it . I have heard it before , or fragments of it . Indeed , one of those same missionaries to whom the tribesmen of your village went , has written a very remarkable report , in which he devotes some space to this story . But reading it or hearing it from others is not like hearing it from your own lips . Every word of it has the ring of reality as you tell it . How could you describe the robes of the Chinese  --  the sensual lips of the Arab  --  the huts of an Indian village if you had never seen them ? The sound of different languages and the clang of a great bronze gong if you had never heard them ? The air of a clime different from ours if you had never felt it ? But I am wondering why a woman who has been so favored of the Almightythat He has sent her on these mystical missions , and who has been so far successful in them that she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians , should doubt that she can give solace and support to one lonely man in his extremity ? "  |p229AS  HE SPOKE the last words , the King rose and stretched out the hands which had been so tightly clenched , as if in appeal . The gesture was involuntary ; it did not for an instant occur to him that the Abbess might take them , nor did it seem to him necessary that she should , in order that he might be sure of her sympathy and support . The tie between them , which he had recognized the moment he looked into her eyes , was so strong that it was independent of touch ; but , instead of agonized repression , here was confident approach , as if his hands , as well as his lips , must show her how he felt . She rose at the same moment that he did and stood very still . But so long as she did not draw back or avert her gaze , the King knew that she did not intend to retreat from him mentally and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she . spoke , her words did not constitute a direct answer and the form they took came as a surprise . " It is now more than ten years , Sire , since I have been to my Indian village . The power which Our Lord gave to me then has left me . " " You mean that it has taken other forms than mystic journeys . For one thing , you became the Abbess of this convent ; because of your humility , you shrank from assuming the office , but you could not withstand the papal bull which bestowed the well-deserved honor upon you . His Holiness was aware that your intelligence , your judgment , your executive abilities and your integrity , not to mention your piety , more than qualified you for the position , de/spite your tender age  --  just as I am well aware that you are also qualified for other tasks . " " I believe that Your Majesty overestimates the intelligence and the executive ability required to govern a small convent like this one . Besides , I never could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You speak in the plural . I know that each of us is supposed to have one , though I have often doubted that this was so in my case . Do you mean to tell me that you have several ? " " Yes , Sire , I have six . One rules over his companions and all have their special tasks , which they fulfill with great fidelity . And they are accompanied by two glorious virgins , no doubt saints , whose identity I do not recognize , who stand watch on either side of them . " " You tell me all this , obviously aware of these guardians and these glorious virgins and , at the same time , expect me to believe that your mystic powers are at an end . You must permit me to differwith you , Sor Maria . And , in any case , to return to the natural qualities which fit you to govern this convent , the degree of integrity , judgment and piety requisite must be the same , whether the field of action be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of matching Your Majesty in argument as I should be in chess . " " Then let us leave argument aside , at least as far as your fitness to govern a convent is affected . After all , it is not that aspect of your abilities with which I am most concerned . " " And , without presumption , may I inquire what does most concernYour Majesty ? " " Your talent as a writer . " It was her turn to repeat the words which the other had spoken . " My talent as a writer ! " she exclaimed , with greater vehemence than at any moment before . " Why , it can not be unknown to Your Majesty that my writings have not been viewed with favor , either by the Holy Inquisition or by my own confessor . " " They are viewed with favor by me , " the King said calmly . " I read your Life of the Virgin Mary and came to know her and venerateher as I never have before . When I heard  --  as I did  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my anger against him knew no bounds . " " Would it be tempered if Your Majesty knew that this work has now been rewritten ? " " What do you mean , rewritten ? " " I mean exactly that . I wrote it under obedience  --  or so I believed  --  toDivine command . I destroyed it under obedience to Christ 's representative  --  my confessor . But this representative gave no instructions to the effect that I should not rewrite it . For five years , I have devoted myself to this task , in such hours as I could spare from other duties . It is now finished . If Your Majesty will accepta copy from my hand , I shall be much honored . " The King , who had continued to smile at her from the moment that he asked how she could doubt that she was fitted to be his counselor , now laughed  --  a laugh of such amused appreciation that the Abbess realized she , too , was very close to laughing . Then he shook his head . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one which I hid and which Fray Francisco did not succeed in adding to his bonfire . But when I spoke of your talent as an author , I was not referring to this or any of your other previous efforts . I hoped I could persuade you to use it in another direction . " " And that was  --  " " As a correspondent . Mine . I want you to write to me . Regularly , freely , confidentially . Your oral prayers I will take for granted . But I also need to see with my own eyes your words of counsel and support . " " Sire  --  " " I could , as your king , command this , could I not ? " " Your Majesty knows this . " " And you would , perforce , obey ? " " Your Majesty knows this also . " " But since , instead of commanding as a monarch , I ask it as a favor for a friend in need , you will refuse me ? " There was another long silence while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had not quickly moved to prevent it , she  |p232would  have knelt to kiss his hand . But he stretched this out and took the crucifix which hung from the long rosary at her belt and pressed his lips against it . " You shall not kneel to me and I shall not kneel to you , " he said . " We shall meet and talk and part without ceremony , after the manner of friends and equals ; and , when we are absent from each other , we shall write freely and fully . For now we see through a glass , darkly ; but then face to face : now I know in part ; but then shall I know even as also I am known . " He recited the Scripture as if it were natural for him to do so and without feeling that there might be irreverence in adapting the apostle 's words to his own thoughts . Then he released the crucifix and stepped backward . " Farewell , Sor Maria . You will hear from me . May God be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Sire , on the way that leads to the greatest welfare and happiness for you and for the realm . Go with the angels . " She lowered the veil over her face before she drew back the bolts and bars of the great door leading into the zagua'n and moved behind it as it swung open , creaking on its hinges . It was not fitting that Don Luis and the others , who had been waiting there more than two hours , should see her thus unveiled . The King stepped over the threshold and she closed the door behind him . At the same moment , Don Luis threw open the one giving onto the outer courtyardand the shouts of the people , who were still waiting in the streets for another glimpse of their sovereign , reverberated through the vestibule and beyond it . Darkness had fallen , but it was the true limpid darkness of Castile . The King ascended the steps of the carroza , bowing to the right and left as he did so ; the grandees followedand took their places beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounted their horses , spurring them on . Despite the lateness of the hour , the cortege took the road to Tarazona . In the locutory , Sor Maria fell on her knees . Much later , her Prioress found her there , still kneeling.  |p233S  OR Maria , Abbess of the Convent of the Concepcionistasin Agreda , was an exceptionally skillful needlewoman , even during the period when accomplishments in the fine art of embroidery were considered a necessary part of every gentlewoman 's education . Not only were the chasubles , worn by the priests in the convent chapel , and the altar cloths and frontals used there elaborate and exquisite , as to both design and stitchery ; but likewise were every corporal and every veil for the chalice , as a result of her talent , her taste and her industry . Considering the vigilance of her rule , the attention which she gave every detail in the management of the convent and the hours which she devoted to prayer , not only in the chapel and the chapter house , but when she was alone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve so much as a result of manual labor . At least , it would have been a mystery , were it not for the fact that there were so many aspects of Sor Maria 's life which were a source of wonder that this seemed no more remarkable than many others . Besides , during Recreation , she never went twittering from one group to another or sat with her hands folded idly , like some of the nuns . There was always a length of linen or silk in her lap , a basket full of bright-colored skeins at her side and a gaily-threaded needle between her fingers . Her nuns were used to seeing the outline of a design develop into a pattern of fruits and flowers before their very eyes . In addition , the Abbess ' own eyes were very strong , not only all-seeing , as the nuns knew when it came to their actions , but able to function hour after hour , when the rest of the convent was sunk in slumber . The Abbess was not obliged to put out her lamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could burn it all night if she chose and many in thep234Community felt sure that she very often did . Otherwise , how could those lengths of linen and silk be so quickly transformed into vestmentsand frontals , where not a single inch of material remained unadorned ? She was working on the most elaborate frontal she had so far attempted when the ringing of a bell presaged a visitor and a messagewas brought by the portress to the torno and , in turn , conveyed to the Abbess by the Prioress that a courier from the King was in the zaguan and requested that the Lady Abbess would receivehim in the locutory . Sor Maria folded the frontal and laid her work aside as calmly as if she had received a message that the milk had soured or a broom had been broken ; then she went unhurriedly to the locutory , taking the Prioress with her . She took her customaryseat behind the grille and did not draw away the curtain untilthe royal courier said , very respectfully , that His Majesty had hoped she would permit him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he placed the scroll in the torno and told her his instructions were to remain in the convent until she had read the letter and written her reply . As soon as the communication was in the Abbess ' hands , she thanked the courier for bringing it and asked for his assurance that His Majesty was in good health . Havingreceived this welcome news , she told him that , if he would return to the zaguan , suitable refreshment would be given him and he would be provided with a place to rest ; provision would also be made for his horse . She then retired to her cell to read the King 's letter . It seemed as if the words rushed forward to meet her . Sor Maria : I write to you leaving a half margin , so that your reply may come on the same paper , and I enjoin and command you not to allow the contents of this to be communicated to anybody . Since the day that I was with you , I have felt much encouraged by your promise to pray to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for the earnest attachment toward my well being that I then recognized in you gave me great confidence and encouragement . As I told you , I left Madrid lacking all human resources , and trusting only to Di/vine help , which is the sole way to obtain what we desire . Our Lord has already begun to work in my favor , bringing in the silver fleet , and relieving Oran when we least expected it ; whereby I have been able , though with infinite trouble and tardiness for want of money , to dispose my forces here so that we shall , I hope , start work with them this week . Although I beseech God and His most holy Mother to succor and aid us , I trust very little in myself ; for I have offended , and still offend very much , and I justly deserve the punishmentsand afflictions which I suffer . And so I appeal to you to fulfill your promise to me , to clamor to God to guide my actions and my arms , to the end that the quietude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout Christendom . The silver fleet was the collective name given to the galleons , united under a single command , which brought in bullion from the New World ; it had been long overdue and some anxiety had been felt , not only about the loss of its greatly needed treasure , but of the ships themselves . So now they had come safely into harbor , as she had prayed that they might ! The relief of Oran was also one of the blessings for which she had most earnestly besiegedthe Throne of Grace ; and at last the Duke of Arcos , Governorof Valencia , had managed to run the blockade and the fortress , which the Moors were beleaguering by both land and sea , was rescued ! She murmured a brief and fervent prayer , this time one of thanksgiving , as she read on . The Portuguese rebels still raid the frontiers of Portugal , acting against God and their natural sovereign . Affairs in Flanders are in great extremity , and there is risk of a rising unless God will intervenein my favor ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence , I fear that unless we can gain some successesto encourage people here they are liable to lose heart and to take a course very injurious to the monarchy . It was the Portuguese who were back of the Moors ' assaults at Oran ; true , it was bad enough to have them making trouble on the frontier , but at least it was not as bad as having them make troublep236in Africa as well . The situation in Flanders was more serious ; that would , indeed , take time and prayer to mend . The defeat at Rocroy , in which General Melo had been captured and the Count de Fuentes killed , had been a shattering blow to the Spanish forces ; but the tragedy back of it  --  the loss of the Cardinal-Infante Fernando  --  was one from which it would be even harder to recover . He had been the King 's best-loved brother , greatly beloved by the people as well and , in the opinion of many , the most brilliant of the three , a prince of great promise and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be blamed for his depression , as far as Flanders was concerned ; if only Fernando had recovered , to take the field again , just once more ! But evidently that had not been God 's Will . Affairs in Aragon , however , were indeed improved by Philip 's presence . The Aragonese were delighted because he had come to them without a great retinue ; the Castilian grandees , in their opinion , were a disturbing influence in their homes and in their government . Moreover , Philip had promptly ordered the releaseof his best general , Felipe de Silva , whom Olivares had consignedto a prison , and the armed forces , under Silva 's direction , were moving toward the French with great energy . The necessities , of course , are numerous and great ; but I must confess that it is not that which distresses me most , but the certain conviction that they all arise from my having offended Our Lord . As He knows , I earnestly wish to please Him and to fulfill my duty in all things ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a knowledge of what it is His holy will that I should do to placate Him , write to me here , for I am very anxious to do right , and I do not know in what I err . Some religious people give me to understand that they have revelations ; and that God commands that I should punish certain persons , and that I should dismiss others from my service . But you know full well that in this matter of revelationsone must be very careful , and particularly when these religiouspersons speak against those who are not really bad , and against whom I have never discovered anything injurious to me ; whilst others are approved whose proceedings are not usually thought wellp237of . The general opinion about these persons is that they love turningthings over , and that their truth can not be depended upon . So he had cause to mistrust revelations ! All the more reason then why she should be touched because he had such implicit faith in her mystical powers and that if she told him God had recommendedhe should punish certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe she spoke the truth and know that her motives were disinterested . Names had been freely mentionedduring their long interview and , though the King 's present reference to certain persons was without identification , she knew he was again alluding to the Conde-Duque , his wife and their adopted son . Well , the Conde-Duque was already banished from Court and his wife had tardily followed him in his exile ; but the son was still in evidence and there had been nothing harsh or conclusive connected with the absence of the others , who were comfortably ensconcedat their country seat . She would try to make it clear to the King when she wrote that they were " really bad , " that they had injuredhim and not only him , but all of Spain . She would have liked to sit quietly for a long time , dwelling on the passages she had just read . But the bell was ringing for Vespers . She must go and take her customary seat in the choir beneath the statue of the Blessed Mother , which represented the Virgin as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the convent  --  the ensigns of its dignity  --  at Her feet . It was becoming to represent Her thus , for She had appeared to Sor Maria , when the young nun hesitated to assume the responsibilities of the convent 's direction , with the assurance that She Herself would be the Divine Directress and that Sor Maria would be Her deputy . And , heretofore , the Abbess had taken her place beneath this symbolic image with calmness . Now she found it hard to do so , though she knew there must be no outwardand visible signs of the emotion which the King 's letter had aroused . Her bearing and deportment should always be an example to the Community . . . . It must , of course , have been imagination that Vespers lasted longer than usual ; but it seemed as if the end thereof would neverp238come and , when it finally did , Sor Maria was still not free to return to her cell and finish reading the King 's letter . One of the novices , a girl whom she had hesitated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pains , apparently was suffering from some kind of a nervous seizure . The Mother Infirmarian had failed to soothe her . She was insisting that the Abbess must come to her bedsideand , even when Sor Maria was far down the corridor that led to the girl 's cell , her shrieks could be heard . " The King ! The King has returned to us ! Why am I not allowed to see him ? " It was seldom that the Abbess pressed her lips together in a hard line , but she did so now , and kept them thus for some moments before she spoke to the distraught novice . When she trusted herself to speak , it must be firmly , but gently , not with severity , or the girl 's hysteria would increase . " His Majesty is not here , " she finally said , sitting down beside the tumbled cot . " He is in Zaragoza , where he is working for our welfare , as we must pray for his . But he has sent a trusted messenger with a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finish reading , much less to answer . I will go and bring it here and do both , if you will promise me to be quiet and , before I reseal the scroll , you may feel it . In that way , your fingers may touch the same place as those of the Lord 's Anointed . " The novice had stopped screaming almost as soon as the Abbess entered the infirmary and now she lay still , staring at her Superior . " I am going to fetch the letter , " Sor Maria said . " And do you be quiet until I come back , else you shall not touch the place where His Majesty 's fingers have rested . " The girl had not answered , but the Abbess knew that now there would be no more trouble , so she went for the letter which she had locked away before going to Vespers . Next , seating herself beside the novice , she read on to the end of it : I do hope that you will keep your word to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for we kings have much of the confessor in us . Do not let yourself be influenced by what the world says , for that is little to be depended upon , seeing the aims of those who move such discourse ; but be guided solely by the inspirationp239of God , before Whom I protest ( and I have just partaken of Him , in the Sacrament ) that I desire in all things , and for all things , to fulfill His sacred law and the obligation which He has laid upon me as a king . And I hope in His mercy that He will take pity on our pains and help us out of these afflictions . The greatest favor that I can receive from His holy hands is that the punishment He lays upon these realms may be laid upon me ; for it is I , and not they , who really deserve the punishment , for they have always been true and firm Catholics . I do hope you will console me with your reply , and that I may have in you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enlighten me , and extricate me from the troubles in which I am now immersed. -I THE KING . Zaragoza , 4 October , 1644 . The abbess glanced from the letter to the bed . The novice lay quite still , apparently half asleep , certainly at peace . Sor Maria spread the letter out on a tablet and , calling to the Mother Infirmarianto bring her an inkpot and a quill , she began to write , as she had been directed to do , on the left-hand margin of the page , where Philip had written on the right-hand side : Your Majesty 's scrupulous self-examination , resulting in a lack of self-confidence , reveals his awareness of sad human frailties , but should in nowise prevent him from trusting in the wonderful power of the Lord . He should remember what happened in the case of King David , who also recognized his failings and suffered severe remorse . Yes , the comparison was a happy one . She was glad she had thought of it . As a youth , David had comforted a mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shepherd , he had composed the Psalms , which had survived as noble literature and become an integral part of Christian liturgy . Philip also had great gifts as a musicianand a poet ; he must be encouraged to cultivate them and not to squander them . David had slain a bloodthirsty giant , when he had no weapon but a sling , and he had become a mighty warrior ; surely , with such an example , Philip could find a way to defeat his power/ful enemies . David had given way to evil passions , robbing Uriah of his one ewe lamb and sending the husband of a beautiful woman to the front , so that he would be killed and David could marry his widow ; certainly , Philip 's sins of the flesh had been no worse than that . And David 's name had come down through the ages as that of a great king and a great man ; Bethlehem , the birthplace of Christ , was called the City of David in the Scriptures and Christ Himself was sometimes called Great David 's Greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this offer I repeat . I shall do penance and I shall entreat Our Merciful Father , mindful of your good intentions , to take pity on your contrite heart , for my heart is troubled by Your Majesty 's great distress . I admit that your realms are in peril . But this peril has a purpose . It comes to you as a punishmentbecause you , a great monarch , the heir to many obligations , are at war with other Catholic kings , thereby opposing the Divine Will and , for this , you must atone . But this very chastisement is a sign of God 's love . She paused again as other passages from the Scriptures came to her mind , appropriate for the moment . There was Paul , writing to the Hebrews and saying , My son , despise not thou the chastening of the Lord , nor faint when thou art rebuked of him : For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth , and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth . And there was St. John the Divine , writing in his Revelations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chasten : be zealous therefore , and repent ; and adding the wonderful promise : To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne . Yes , that would be the next point to stress . But this is not because God does not look with loving kindness on a great monarch , the holder of a great heritage , and the lands over which he rules . It is because this great monarch has striven against other kings of his faith and waged war with them . This and other offenses to the Divine purposes have been committed . But , as soon as the old habits are overcome , there will be a renewal ofp241blessings from the Most High . He will help Your Majesty to hold firm in new ways which are good ways . She put down her quill , this time not because she was dwelling on Scriptural passages , but because she herself felt impelled to speak frankly and she wondered whether or not she should mention names in doing this . To be sure , both she and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation ; but that was safer in the spoken than in the written word . The King would have no trouble in knowing to whom she was referring , any more than she had had trouble in guessing to whom he was referring . She would follow his example and use no names . She picked up her pen again . As soon as Your Majesty has abandoned the old evil ways and been delivered from sin by the Lord 's redemption , you will have cause to rejoice in the change from chastisement to approbation . I trust in the clemency of the Most High . He will help Your Majesty to persevere in good and holy ways and to follow the right path , punishing evil and administering justice without respect to persons ; but taking care that the poor be not abused ; rather for their humility that they be exalted . ( Remember that God Himself became a poor man in this world for our sins . ) On the other hand , the rich and the proud must be humbled when they do not govern themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewarded for , in the sight of God , mercy and kindness and justice are all attributes of equal merit . When all this has been done , events will take a happier course . I can not approve or endorse the discredit of one man for the advancement of another . It is sometimes necessary to speak candidly , but this can be done without injuring the reputation of a fellow man . Certain persons , who have Your Majesty 's ear , contend that others , who are close to him , while meddlesome , are of no help in affairs of state , since private virtues are not necessarily of value when it comes to the science of governing . The argument is that there are others possessing a greater talent and capacity for statecraft . This government covers a monarchy of vast proportions ; therefore , it isp242needful that the resources be great and varied and , just as God distributedtalents unequally  --  to one man more , to another less  --  meritsare likewise unequal . She halted for a moment , Our Lord 's story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to dwell on this now or to enlarge on it in her letter . She must finish what she had started to say . The gravest danger lies in the fact that , instead of looking out for the common welfare and that of their prince and king , there are those who seek private advantage and personal gain . My Lord : this happens both in peace and in war and , as a result , Your Majesty 's realms are impoverished . There are still men who prosper and grow rich , who crowd to see which one can come nearest to the fire and warm himself with worldly treasures and , therefore , who feel envy toward others and a need to compete with them . At a time like the present , it would be better to reduce all such persons to a single rank . Let audiences be given equally to one after another , so that each may feel he is enjoying special favor , whereas no one would receive more than another , unless the royal will should so deign . The Creator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , in order to vivify and animate all its parts and the sun lightens everyone without distinction . So Your Majesty must vivify , animate and enlighten all parts of his kingdom . There is a general feeling that all of today 's calamities stem from the errors of the late administration . Since success is not easily and quickly achieved , those persons who spoke of dismissal and punishmentjudge hastily and jump to the conclusion that the one who governed before this still governs , because those who remain close to Your Majesty must , perforce , favor the ones who brought them to his attention ; and kinship is a powerful bond . And it would be prudent to give consideration among the worldly for , after all , Your Majesty has to rely on the world . These thoughts lose much when confided to a pen , for Your Majesty 's needs can not be adequately satisfied through the written word . I trust , however , that if Your Majesty acts according to thep243desires of Our Lord , He will give solace and grant prosperity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His Mercy and , in turn , use it for the benefit of others and , also , that we repent and mend our ways , so that we may not be unworthy of it . There was more that she might have said , that she would have liked to say , but she had used up all the space on the left-hand side of the paper and , according to the King 's instructions , that was the place she was to use for her reply . She rang the bell that summoned the Sister Secretary and , when the young woman entered the infirmary , the Abbess asked a single question . " Has the King 's messenger received suitable refreshment ? " " Yes , Reverend Mother , and has expressed great appreciation . " " Then give him this letter and bid him Godspeed . " The Sister Secretary took the folded sheet , bowed and retired . The Abbess glanced at the bed where the sick novice lay ; she was peacefully sleeping now . Maria de Agreda rose and silently left the infirmary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first in a series that was to continue for twenty years . Three months later , that is to say in November , Olivares ' illegitimateson , Don Enrique Felipez de Guzman , Marques de Mairena , who still lingered futilely at Court , received orders to leave there with his wife and mother-in-law and retire , either to the Conde-Duque 's nearby country seat at Loeches , where the latter had been living undisturbed until June , or to Toro , the more distantseat of his sister , the Marquesa de Alcanices , where he had then been ordered to retreat . The exile of the Condesa , who had managed to find one pretext or another for remaining nominally in the serviceof the Queen and Baltasar Carlos for some time , had begun a month earlier than that of her stepson ; she was already with her husband at Toro . One last effort was made to render possible the resumption of her post . But it failed , as all others in behalf of her and her husband had failed . From the moment that she wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p244FOR  six months after his meeting with Sor Maria the King , fortified by her letters and her prayers , remained with his little army , which did well in both Cataluna and Aragon ; and , when the important city of Monzon was captured from the French by General de Silva early in December , Philip felt justified in returning to Madrid to spend Christmas with his wife and children . But his inclination was for solemn thanksgiving rather than for merrymaking ; he was not in the mood for the frivolitiesof the Buen Retiro and actually preferred to live at the grim Alcazar . He went to pray , not only at the Shrine of Atocha , but at the Convent of the Descalzas Reales , even though the Queen , for reasons of etiquette , could not conveniently accompany him on the latter pilgrimage : his cousin Margarita was occupying the royal apartments and though , as a widowed duchess and a deposed vicereine , her rank did not entitle her to special consideration , when it came to questions of precedence , it was easier all around not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I ca n't very well let her act as my hostess in my own quarters , can I ? " Isabel asked , quite without rancor , but as if stating an inescapable rule of protocol . " On the other hand , I 'm certainly not going to ask her to leave and let me take over . She seems to be quite satisfied to live at the convent and I 'm very thankful . She was n't satisfied at Badajoz or Merida and she was definitely dissatisfied at Ocana and the Encarnacion . Let 's not invitefurther dissatisfaction . " Philip agreed that it was better to leave well enough alone , as far as Margarita was concerned , though he regretted even this shortp245separation from Isabel , when he knew that he should so soon be on his way to rejoin his army . But , with her at his side again , he took time to attend the rather staid celebrations which , at his request , had supplanted more sumptuous entertainments and to write a long letter to Sor Maria . She had written him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " thoroughly versed " in everything touching him . " This admonition is very important , " she had added , " and in order to adopt it with the full knowledge of the facts , Your Majesty should choose , guided by your own sound judgment , someone on whom you can depend and listen to him . " Philip wanted to assure her , without delay , that he appreciated her advice and would try to act upon it ; also , that he was counting on her prayers for the safe arrival of the silver fleet from the Indies , in the same measure that he had relied on them for the victory at Monz6n . He wrote : The promise you gave me when I was with you , that your prayersshould not fail me , delighted me much , and I remind you of it in the greatest necessities . We are expecting hourly , by God 's help , the arrival of the galleons , and you may imagine what depends upon it for us ; and although I hope that , in His Mercy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urge you to help me by supplicating His Divine Majesty to do me this favor . It is true , I do not deserve it , but rather great punishment ; but I have full confidence that He will not permit the total loss of this monarchy , and that He will continue the successes that He has begun to give us . I should very much like to succeed in carrying out the advice you give me in your letter of the 6th instant . I can assure you I will try to do so ; and for my part , I will use every effort to comply with the will of God , both personally and in official matters . May He give me grace to do it . I can not help telling you of the joy it gave me to come hither and see the Queen and my children , for my absence had seemed to me very long . They are , thank God , very well ; and although I shall feel keenly leaving such company , I am preparing to return ; for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even before the pleasure of being with such treasures as these . God send me the time when I may enjoy them with more tranquility. -I THE KING.  |p246Even  Twelfth Night passed without the usual revels . Instead of distributing numerous honors on that day , as had been his custom , Philip limited himself to one : he promoted Diego de Velazquez to the post of Chamberlain and presented him with the golden key which was the insignia of that office . This was Velazquez ' first advancement since he had joined the King 's household twenty years before and the pamphleteers praised it with enthusiasm . Early in February , with a small and unpretentious suite , Philip returned to Aragon . It had been a wrench for him to tear himself away from his family ; but the lack of his personal leadership had already made itself felt . His officers were quarreling among themselvesover style and precedence ; this was annoying , but it was not disastrous . A much more serious difficulty arose when a deputation of Aragonese nobles confronted him with a demand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victor of Monz6n and the ablest general available . Only jealousy could account for such a bold requirement ; Silva was a Portuguese and his preeminencewas a thorn in the flesh of Zaragoza . Philip tried to temporizewith the haughty Aragonese ; he was in desperate need of Silva 's continued services . But the question was settled out of hand by the general 's abrupt resignation ; he had had enough of this petty and unjustified opposition . Philip was still trying to reason with him and persuade him to remain at his post , at least for the present , when even worse news was brought to him by a courier : the Queen , who had conceived again at Christmastime , had suffered a miscarriage and was critically ill . Passing years had had the effect of increasing rather than lesseningPhilip 's devotion to his wife . She had never failed to respond to his passionate demands upon her , not as if it were her wifely duty , but as if it were her wifely privilege and pleasure ; and her own splendid vitality , inherited from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire , to take almost perennial childbirth in her stride and to welcome him back to her bed , when one ordeal was barely behind her , without dread of the one which was almost inevitably ahead of her . She had never reproached him because , despite her glad compliance and her inexhaustible fecundity , he had persistentlysought satiation elsewhere . Indeed , only once in their longp247married life  --  when he had built the balcony for Ines  --  had she given way to jealous anger , and that very briefly . He derived comfort from the conviction that Isabel believed his feeling for la Calderona was the only one which had really rivaled his feeling for her , that all his other transitory attachments had had very little to do with love , and that they had never seriously affected his tenderness for her as his wife or his respect for her as his queen . If Isabel were thus convinced , she was right ; in addition to finding her a brilliant and charming companion , and a delightfully accessible bed fellow , he had become increasingly conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perseverance in ferreting out useful facts and her patriotic loyalty to his country . But it was only recently that he had begun to evaluate the true worth and great variety of all these qualities , combined in one and the same person . Because he had not done so sooner , he naturally had failed to tell her that he did . Now , as he sat in his lonely study , far away from her , and reflectedon the omission , he felt he could not wait to make amends for it . He turned and motioned to the Gentleman of the Bedchamberwho was posted at the door and who promptly came forward and respectfully awaited orders . " Do you happen to know whether or not the Marques de Aytona is in his apartment ? " Philip inquired . " Yes , Sire . He dined at the Archbishopric . But he returned about an hour ago . " " Tell him I wish to speak with him at once . " Philip could not have explained why the Marques de Aytona had come so quickly to mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Archduchess Clara Eugenia died and , until the arrival of the Cardinal-Infante , had provisionally taken command of both the military and the civilian branches of the government . He had proved an able and conscientious administrator and , in recognition of his signal service , he was one of the few kinsmen of the Conde-Duque who had not been definitely dismissed and long since absent from the King 's entourage ; on the other hand , he had never been closely connected in any way with his sovereign . The Conde de Haro would , perhaps , have been the more logical choice . But for some inexplicable reason it was the Marques that the Kingp248had summoned and who , in prompt response to these summons , entered the royal presence . " I am going to Madrid , " Philip said tersely . " Please prepare to accompany me . As it is now nearly eleven , I assume it will not be feasible to leave before dawn , but I propose to do so then  --  on horseback . We will each need two extra horses for relays . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eighteen leagues to Calatayudbefore night . There we will stay with the Knights of Jerusalem . You will send off a courier at once to advise them of our coming . " " Yes , Sire . " " We will leave the first horses there and get others . Then we will make a longer day  --  covering the twenty-one leagues between Calatayud and Siguenza . In Siguenza , we will , of course , stay with the Bishop . " " Yes , Sire . " " The third day , we should do better still . We can change horses at Guadalajara and then push on to Alcala  --  nineteen leagues . There we will be the guests of the Cardinal . By then , we are practically on the doorstep of Madrid . " Philip leaned forward in his chair , his head resting in his hands . There was a short silence . Aytona waited , uncertain whether or not he was to consider himself dismissed . Philip sighed and looked up again . " The Queen is very ill , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention here will have to await my return . You may so advise the proper authorities . " The sky was still gray as they rode away from the palace , but by the time they reached the bridge , the first streaks of pink appeared close to the horizon and were reflected in the waters of the Ebro . The trees along the way were just coming into bud and , though there was a chill in the air , it was only the chill of dawn . In the river valley , spring was already beginning ; the real cold would come later when they began to climb . The clatter of hooves ceased as they left the outskirts of the city , because , beyond that , there were no cobblestones ; the road was veryp249rough and every now and then the impact of a horseshoe on a loose rock made a sharp , sudden sound . The sky did not grow any brighter because there were rain clouds ahead and , presently , a slight drizzle began . If this gets any worse , it will slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only rough but slippery , Philip said to himself ; but he did not say it aloud . He did not want to admit to Aytona that anything might slow them up . The drizzle continued and the real cold began . There were no buds on the trees now ; these were as stark and as bare as if it had been late January instead of late March . Philip had drunk a cup of chocolate before leaving the palace , but he had done it hastily , not taking time to have a second one , as he usually did ; he was beginning to realize that his stomach was very empty and that when it becametoo empty he might feel faint . He had not slackened his pace once since leaving Zaragoza , but had gone ahead at a swift , steady gallop . Now he reined in his horse and turned to Aytona . " It is time we changed horses , so we might as well stop long enough for a little food as well . I 'd planned to halt just a few minutesby the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover . " He glanced toward a nearby hillside and then looked back at Aytona . " There are several seignorial houses at La Almunia de Dona Godina where they 'd make us more than welcome , " he said . " But then we 'd have to stop for the usual exchange of courtesies and we 've no time for that . I think one of those hillside caves at Ricla would be a better choice . We may be lucky enough to find one empty . If not , we can ask a cave dweller for hospitality . " " As Your Majesty wishes . . . . If we are not lucky enough to find an empty cave , does Your Majesty desire that his identity be made known ? " " Under no circumstances . " They turned their horses toward the slope , just beyond the villageof Ricla , which was lined with caves , and drew up at the first one they reached . The path leading upward had been very steep and even rougher than the highway and they were glad to stop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could look towardits interior . This was in semi-darkness , except at the rear , where a glow indicated the existence of a fire . Two or three persons werep250huddled close to it and a savory smell suggested the preparation of food . He stepped inside the opening and called out a greeting . An answering call came from within , as one of the figures detached itselffrom the others , and an elderly , bearded man in ragged clothing limped forward . Though he regarded the riders with puzzlement , there was no animosity in his gaze and he mumbled , " Buenos dias , " even before the King and his companion had voiced the same words . " Would you let us take shelter with you for a few minutes ? " Philip asked . " We are cold and hungry and have already come a long way and have much further to go . " " Esta es su casa , " the ragged man answered instantly , his expressionchanging from one of bewilderment to one of welcome . " There is not much food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And at least the fire will warm you . It is a bitter day to be traveling . Beforenight , there may well be snow . Are you wise to go on ? " Philip had now dismounted and , as Aytona started to change the saddles , the King took a packet from his saddlebag and entered the cave . " It is a case of urgency . If possible , we must reach Calatayud beforedark . . . . We have food with us , " he went on , as the old man stood aside to let him pass . " It would please us if you would accept some of ours and , in turn , we will , of course , accept some of yours . In that way , there will be no loss , but gain on both sides . " While he spoke , he looked toward the fire and saw that the other figures which had been gathered close to it were a young woman with a baby at her breast and two small children , very ragged and thin , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at him with friendly eyes . There was an iron pot bubbling over the fire and , when she had invited her guests to be seated , the young woman began to ladle out generous portions of the thick soup known as puchero . There were only two earthenware bowls to receive this , but she handed one to Philip and stood holding the other until Aytona could sit down beside him . " We will have ours afterward , " she said . " I do not know why my father told you we did not have much to eat . There is plenty for everybody . "  |p251Of  course , Philip could not see the inside of the iron pot , but he doubted this . However , he was well aware that he must not voice his doubts and began to eat the soup with a large wooden spoon . " This tastes very good to me , " he told his hostess . " In fact , I have seldom eaten so good a puchero . " The woman smiled . " It would be better if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " But when my husband is gone with the mesta , it is not so easy to get game . My father is too old to do much hunting . However , we have some cheese and a little of last year 's honey is still left . You could spread those on your bread . " " Yes , I will do that . And you must eat some of our chicken . I hope you will find it as good as I find your soup . And perhaps the children would like a dulce . " He knew better than to say mazaprin . He was sure they had never had any and that the name of the famous Toledo sweetmeat would confuse them ; then they would hang back , hesitating to chance it . As it was , they fell on the candy almost wolfishly , without waiting for their mother to serve them any of the chicken , the ham or the white bread that also came out of the packet . When Philip set his soup bowl aside , the old man handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if his guest would know how to handle it . These travelers were gentry , there was no doubt of that , and mostly such gentry as he had seen were very awkward with goatskins . But this hidalgo held it high and let the wine flow easily into his mouth , not spilling a drop . The old man 's respect for his guests , great already , grew greater still . " It would be pleasant to linger for another drink , " Philip said , as he lowered the goatskin . " That is very good wine . But , as I told you when we arrived , it is urgent that we get to Calatayud . I have been to Zaragoza on business and there I learned that my wife is very ill , so I am hurrying to her side . There has been a mishap and we will not have the baby we expected . " He turned to the young woman . " Has your baby been baptized yet ? " he asked . " No , Your Worship . " " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , Your Worship . " " Unless you have other plans , I would be very pleased if
