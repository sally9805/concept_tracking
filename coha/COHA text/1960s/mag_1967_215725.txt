The Birds , the Bees and the Italians . Pietro Germi 's boisterous travelogue through the bedrooms of a small Italian city was originally called simply Signore e Signori ; its hoked-up English title is about its only flaw . <P> The theme is adultery , and the assembled husbands of Trevise provide a hilarious survey of some of the resultant absurdities .

When a teen age peasant girl ( Patrizia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of collective amiability , and later hauls them before a judge , they take up a collection to buy her off and rescue the community 's honor . <P> The appeal of Germi 's storytelling , as in his earlier Divorce-Italian Style , comes about largely through his impeccable feeling for pace . Birds spins out its simple material for nearly two hours , but every breath and heartbeat seems to occupy exactly the right amount of time .
