txt Mayor Daley has been warned that the city 's excellent fire insurance rating is in serious jeopardy because of some of Fire Commissioner Robert J. Quinn 's department policies , a TRIBUNE investigation disclosed yesterday . Details of a preliminary study by fire control experts called in by the mayor six months ago conclude the city is in c'anger of losing its prized " class 2 " fire insurance rating because fire department officials have ignored a cityfinanced 1964 study . It was just four years ago that Mayor Daley announced his success in having the city 's insurance r a tin g improved from " class 3 " to the present rating of class 2 . The net effect was a saving of $1,250,000 for Chicago property owners each year , he said then . The insurance ratings range from an ideal " class 1 " ? never ' granted - to a low of " class 10 . " Insurance rates rise as the class number goes up . Ratings are based on inspections of fire facilities by the National Board of Fire Underwriters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ordered a $30,000 study to update the five-year-old recommendation : , which fire experts say can not be salvaged . Loss of the 2d class rating could mean an annual increase of nearly Ph million dollars in premiums to property owners . Projected 15 Years The 1964 study , by the same experts , was projected over a 15-year-period and called for better utilization of manpower and equipment and construction of new fire stations designed to keep pace with the city 's growth and changing population patterns . Quinn denied any knowledge of the warning that ' the city may lose its fire rating . The class 2 rating is held by only a few other cities in the nation with populations of more than 500,000 . " The only area where we have failed is the construction of fire stations , " said Quinn . " And you do n't build those I overnight . We have complied with all other recommendations of the 1964 study except that some of the equipment has not been moved . I do n't know about any statements that the fire rating is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of the city-financed studies have been conducted under the direction of Gerald L. Maatman , former director of the Illinois Institute of Technology 's fir e protection and safety engineering department , now employed as fire department consultant by a north side insurance firm . A survey by THE TRIBUNE showed there are vacant lots where new fire stations are supposed to be under construction . It also disclosed numerous failures to transfer some fire equipment to other areas of the city for better protection . Maatman refused to discuss the present study in detail , but said it will be given to the mayor next month and will be " somewhat critical . " Maatman also confirmed reports that he warned Daley six months ago that the city 's fire rating is in " serious jeopardy . " Details of Report Details of the preliminary report which were obtained by THE TRIBUNE show these factors leading to the warning : 1 . Fewer than half the fire companies recommended for relocation have been moved . Only 5 of 14 recommended engine relocations have been accomplished . 2 . Programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1800s  --  have fallen far behind schedule . Only Gerald Maatman 10 of 24 scheduled to be closed by this year are closed . 3 . Engines to be taken out of service and replaced with new equipment continue to operate while other fire fighting vehicles that should have remained in service were eliminated . 4 . Only 50 per cent of the new fire stations to be constructed in 1968 have been built . 5 . Purchases of new equipment must be accelerated to offset the large proportion of " middle age " equipment . Shortage of Squads The report concludes : " One of the most important parts of the second class rating required implementation of the plan presented in 1964 involving institution of adequate salvage service in concentrated mercantile areas . . . National Board of Fire Underwriters requires seven squads with a full complement of men in service and field equipment . Squad eliminations leave only two salvage squads . " This defies assessment as to future direction . There has not been adequate coordination maintained with department of planning and urban renewal . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine companies , some serious mistakes have been made in this regard . In addition , the failure to keep the fire station construction program on schedule has kept the engine and truck company relocation plan considerably behind schedule and thus postponed needed shifting of companies to better cover outlying portions of the city . " In addition , the removal of nine squad companies firm service/ has seriously jeopardized the city 's class 2 fire rating . Finally , the present mixedup state of the entire program in conjunction with a failure to properly coordinate it with municipal planning efforts dictates the need to repeat the 1964 study in the near future . " The city received its present fire rating in 1964 based on the same plan and its pledge to make major changes in fire department operations . THE TRIBUNE survey shows increasingly less compliance with the study each year slave 1964 . The president of the Chicago Fire Fighters union hinted yesterday that firemen might vote for what he described as a work slowdown to emphasize their demands for a reduction in work hours . John Tebbens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent efforts by the union that removed a no-strike clause from its constitution , now makes such action possible . Tebbens led the fight to elimi- ' nate the clause during a union . convention in Toronto last month . Explains " SlowdOnne Tebbens has indicated in the past , however , that any " slowdown " by firemen would involve only refusals to perform maintenance tasks and record keeping duties . He said firemen would continue to report for duty and fight fires . The present dispute centers around unfulfilled promises of reduced hours Tebbens claims were made this summer by Mayor Daley and Fire Commissioner Robert J. Quinn . Tebbens said the mayor promised to reduce the span of weekly duty from the present 50 1/2 hours to 47 1/2 hours , effective Oct. 15 . Tebbens , who was reached by phone in Springliefd where he is attending the Illinois Federation of Labor convention , said the union has received no further word on the reductions . Upset by Commissioner " I do n't believe Quinn is making any ( effort to solve the problems we have taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken a lot of abuse . We do feel the Mayor will keep his word , however ; so at this point we do n't care what Quinn says . " Quinn said that if the reduced hour demauos are met , a complete reorganization might he necessary to have the men work an eight-hour day and 40-hour week .
