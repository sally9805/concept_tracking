 | Let 's Plug the Billion-Dollar Farm Drain I N 1933 , Congress launched the U.S. government on a program of crop subsidies and controls in an effort to help the nation 's seven million farmers . Today , $51 billion and 35 years later , look who is being helped : ? In Lake County , Ill. , retired coal-company executive Dennis Gent converted his Midlane Farm into a country club , complete with golf course , swimming pool and riding academy . Inside his awningfringed barn , where milk cows once stood , people sip cocktails in an airconditioned bar . Nevertheless , because he agreed not to grow corn for ten years on his allotted 307 acres , Washington paid Gent $70,177 . " I do n't really need the money , " he says . " I just took t check to show how stupid the fa program is . " ? Near Sugarland , Texas , cony laborers harvest cotton under t watchful eyes of pistol-toting guar For this and several similar far the Texas prison system bagged $288,911 in 1966 from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 5149 farmers an corporations got more than $25 , each from the USDA . Among the farmers , the Hawaiian Commercial &; Sugar Co. of Honolulu got $I 236,355 , and a Corcoran , Calif. , co poration collected nearly $3 million Five large farm operators made total haul of more than $8 million in subsidy checks ! LET 'S PLUG THE BILLION-DOLLAR FARM DRAIN 73  | Meanwhile , the small farmers whom the program was supposed to help continue to leave the land . Since 1950 the farm population has cut in half , and farm units are pearing at a rate of 100,000 a year . Reliable estimates indicate that today 's farm population of 11 millionwill decline again by almost half in the next 12 years . Foredoomed to Fail . Manifestly , tested against its advertised objectives , our farm program has failed . Nobody is more aware of this than the farmers themselves . A recent Farm Journal poll shows that 63 percent of them favor an end to costly subsidy-and-control apparatus . " Now is the time to dismantle obsolete federal farm program , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization , the American Farm Bureau Federation . At one time , even Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman seemed to agree . In November 1964 , he indicated that the government should get out of the wheat market when stocks dropped to 600 million bushels . Today many government storage bins are empty , and wheat stocks are down to 426 million bushels , a four-month supply that is below the level of prudent reserves . But the USDA now demands that Congress continue , even expand , subsidies for wheat and other crops . Such proposals seemed to make sense in 1933 when cotton was six cents a pound , corn 29 cents a bushel , and the nation 's seven million farmers were lucky if they made back the money spent on seed and fertilizer . Something had to be done . New Deal theorists reasoned that the way to help farm families was to raise prices for , their products . Congress agreed to let the government limit acreage and buy enough " surplus " in bumper crop years to raise prices to a level that Washington judged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this program was foredoomed to fail because it was designed to resist , not cushion , change . The planners reckoned without the revolution in farm technology . Since 1935 , for example , tractors , planting and harvesting machines , and chemical weed killers have slashed labor needs . The farmer who in 1935 worked 108 hours to bring in too bushels of corn today brings in that amount in one tenth the time . The result is that wheat yields have doubled , and cotton and corn yields have nearly tripled . In the past seven years alone , mechanical cotton pickers and other machines have cut the Mississippi Delta 's need for harvest labor by 87 percent . Thus , every time government has screwed acreage controls 74 tighter , the farmers have poured on more know-how and in some instances have buried the nation in surpluses for which the taxpayer has had to fork out high storage costs and price-support subsidies . 12 Feet of Rules . How can a program costing billions endure when its futility is so abundantly evident ? The answer lies in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spawn their own vested-interest lobby of politicians , bureaucrats and constituent beneficiaries that perpetuate them long after conditions that called them into being have changed . Indeed , farm subsidies are a case history of a political bureaucracy beyond control . For example , the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service ( ASCS ) , the bureau directly charged with administering crop controls and paying out subsidies , supplements its regular 5000-man staff with some 90,000 farmers who serve part-time as ASCS " committeemen . " Some of the committeemen draw as much as $66 a day plus expenses . These full- and part-time agents roam nearly 3000 counties enforcing a mass of rules and regulations that fill a 12-foot shelf . In a typical Illinois county , 20 people staff the ASCS headquarters while patrols of a dozen or more tramp the fields with " measuring worm " chains every summer , surveying to be sure that farmers are not overplanting their allotted acreage , ordering them to plow under any excess . In addition , airplanes over farms from coast to coast to that government rules arc ( ) Ix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped of 251 , square miles of farmland at a cos $560,951.28 . Now the bureauc even contemplate adapting the " in the sky " space satellite to en ( their rules . " Licked Bad . " This vast burs cratic organization constitutes a vi cog in the political machine whi some urban and farm politicians as a means of keeping the reins power ? and their own jobs . Mou ing opposition led Congress to or a nationwide referendum in 1 on the proposed USDA wheat p gram for the 1964 crop . Secrets Freeman mobilized his army of IC eral payrollers to obtain a " yes " vote going so far as to require AS committeemen to sign a " loyal oath " to support the program . Th were even directed to remind broa casters that their licenses requi public-service broadcasting , and radio and 300 television station were sent propaganda tape and film . Nevertheless , wheat growers deliv. ered a shocking rebuke . They not . only failed to give the wheat plan ? the required two-thirds vote , but rejected it outright by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad , " Freeman lamented . But farmers underestimated the . tenacity of entrenched bureaucrats fighting to save their empire . Through raw political power , the Administration rammed through a  | new wheat-control program anyway . A majority of representatives from the ten leading wheat states votred against the measure , but the big:city representatives outvoted them 211 to 203 . Then , by wheedling and pressuring urban lawmakers , the White House obtained u four-year extension for the entire subsidy-and-control apparatus that will keep farmers under the bureaucracy 's thumb through 1969 . The word went out on Capitol Hill : balky urban Democrats would risk closure of military installations in i heir cities . In 1966 , an election year marked by housewives protesting spiraling food bills , an effort was made to repay the big-city politicians . In an attempt to lower prices , the USDA ( lumped hundreds of millions of bushels of surplus corn into the marketplace . An enterprising Des Moines Register reporter published a secret " Dear Bob " letter from Freeman , which specifically asked Secretary of Defense McNamara to cut military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " McNamara complied ; pork purchases for the Armed Forces were cut by 50 percent . In August 1966 , Albert H. Quie , then a member of the House Agriculture Committee , estimated that the USDA 's election-year price manipulations cheated producers of corn , wheat , soybeans and grain sorghums out of $1 billion net income they could have earned in an unrigged market . Computer-Controlled Tractors . Nevertheless , the propaganda barrage for subsidized farming continues . Washington warns farmers that returning to a free market would cut their net income by one third . Respected economists disagree . Last May , more than 200 state ASCS members were brought to Washington at taxpayer expense to hear Freeman exhort : " Go out and militantly carry the story of these programs to farmers and others . " To this end , the Department had earlier staged " shirt-sleeve " rallies like one at Hutchinson , Kan. , where 400 ASCS committeemen appeared and , for showing , received their per diem allotments ? tax paid . Despite the enticements and propaganda , however , fully half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voluntary " subsidy-andcontrols program . The harsh fact is that we are only halfway through the farm revolution . With technology now available we can plow the moon 's surface with robots . The day is coming when the Kansas and Nebraska plains will be dotted with television towers monitoring computer-controlled tractors that are planting , fertilizing , weeding and harvesting without a human being in sight . Farm labor needs will decrease no matter how much money we throw away on our Depression-born maze of controls and subsidies . Is n't it obvious that we must stop the tax waste of our futile subsidies and begin truly to help the farm people dis76 THE READER 'S DIGEST  | placed in this inexorable revolution ? Congress next year must decide whether to continue the present program or to strike out in a new direction . Many are reaching the conclusion that to continue crop subsidies would be stupid and wasteful . Moreover , it would offer a false hope to farmers , small and large , that Washington can through legislative magic change the economic facts of life , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Farm policy , " says Harvard economist Dr. Hendrik S. Houthakker , " should not aim at reviving the past but at facilitating adjustment to the future . " " I 'd Rather Gamble . " More than half of America 's farm produce has always gone to market without Washington 's benevolent controls . Producers of such non-controlled crops as beef and pork , vegetables and fruit have avoided the surpluses plaguing their controlled brethren , and have prospered by responding quickly to market needs . " I 'd rather gamble on the open market , take the downs in order to get the ups , " reports cattle rancher Jim Crawford of Choteau , Mont . " We 'll do all right as long as the government stays out of the beef business . " We have every reason to believe that producers of the six controlled crops can now do so , too . Rep. Tom Curtis of Missouri and I , supported by 19 other Republicans and Democrats , have introduced legislation to end subsidies and controls immediately on the two crops in which no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo provide credit guarantees so fat-me can borrow against their harvest crops , enabling them to supplant t bureaucrats in deciding when t move their produce onto the ope market . The four remaining crops tobacco , peanuts , cotton and rice can be decontrolled through careful . ly staged transitions . Meanwhile , the Congress must work out programs to provide displaced farm people with better opportunities than moving them into crowded cities , all too often onto rolls of jobless and welfare clients . The long-range best interests of both farmers and all other taxpayers lie in untangling the legislative and bureaucratic maze that has grown up , and in letting the marketplace function more freely . But until citizens from all parts of the country , especially those in urban areas , join with the farmers in demanding forthright action , the mess will only grow worse . The ruinous results of our present farm policies can be remedied only if city dwellers understand the vital stakes and demand that their representatives in Congress act now to avoid disaster .
