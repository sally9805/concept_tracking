The state of siege under which the U.S. defense community finds itself is no passing thing . Important segments of Congress and the public are increasingly vocal in their criticism of the size , influence and performance of the military and its industrial suppliers ( TIME cover , April 11 ) . Last week the tarnish on Pentagon brass spread even further with the disclosure that the Air Force had falsified reports about the price of the C-5A transport plane under production by the Lockheed Aircraft Corp . <P> Testifying before a congressional subcommittee , Air Force Colonel Kenneth N. Beckman , the officer in charge of the C-5A contract , said that in mid-1968 it became clear that Lockheed 's original cost estimate of $2.9 billion for 120 C-5As was too low . The Air Force raised the estimate to $3.1 billion , then raised it again to $3.4 billion to reflect a change in specifications . The actual cost has been nearly $1 billion more than the highest estimate . Yet Colonel Beckman said two of his civilian superiors in the Pentagon approved a juggling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common stock . ( One of the civilians resigned last year ; the other is scheduled to leave Government service when his replacement is confirmed in the Senate . ) <P> Self-Study . The day after Beckman 's appearance , Defense Secretary Melvin Laird issued an apologetic statement in which he said : " I am determined to ensure that full and accurate information on C-5A procurement , and all other procurement matters , is given to the Congress and to the public promptly . I am also determined to ensure that past mistakes in procurement of this transport aircraft will not be repeated . " <P> The Defense Department is trying other measures in an effort to recapture national esteem . Laird and Deputy Defense Secretary David Packard last weekend led a contingent of Pentagon officials ( and their wives ) to Airlie House in Virginia . The purpose of the self-study was to seek ways of cutting the $80 billion defense budget and work out new procedures for keeping future spending in check . Strategists are also considering the possibility of shrinking the armed forces ' size by about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now 3,400,000 in uniform . <P> Laird is expected soon to appoint an unprecedented official commission , including people from outside the Pentagon , to review the strategic priorities for the next few decades . To forestall any doubts about the commission 's findings , the chairmanship will probably go to a prominent outsider , perhaps a journalist . Any new Administration could be expected to take at least a perfunctory reappraisal of the nation 's military posture . Under attack , Nixon 's men seem to be taking seriously the need for a genuine and comprehensive review .
