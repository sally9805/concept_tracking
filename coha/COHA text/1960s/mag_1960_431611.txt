 | SPORTING HOLLYWOOD @# IT HAS BECOME almost axiomatic in the last couple of years to say . at it took the Dodgers to make Los Angeles a big-time sports town . Look at the white-shirted frenzy that develops in the Coliseum on game days , runs the argument ; look at the movie bigwigs who now make a fetish of the game ? Jeff Chandler traveling to San Francisco for Opening Day , Jerry Lewis hollering from his box seat as though he were acting on the set , Bing Crosby owning a piece of the Pittsburgh Pirates , Bob Hope buying into the Cleveland Indians and the Rams . Was it ever like this before ? Ask those who see Los Angeles as the coming , if not actual , sporting capital of the nation . The answer is of course it was , and not so long ago at that , in the great and gaudy days when Hollywood was in its finest flower and , man for woman , one of the most feverishly sporting communities of all . This is not to imply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but they have changed .

Ronald Reagan ( who broadcast the Cubs and White Sox games in Chicago before he went to Hollywood ) has jumpers , and Dan Dailey is master of hounds at the West Hills Hunt Club . Jimmy Stewart is an ardent hunter and fisherman , Gable hunts , Cooper skin-dives . Bing Crosby , besides his share of the Pirates , operates the major golf tournament that bears his name .

Among the younger artists , there are skiers and golfers and tennis players , horsemen and sailors , and Rock Hudson himself confesses that he lives principally for the time that he can spend on his boat . Samuel Goldwyn has two gardeners working full time on his croquet courts and sponsors a tournament every summer , and continued  | David Niven and Louis Jourdan are among the actors who play in it . But all this is pallid stuff compared to the old days , when the Hollywood Stars provided minor league baseball and the big sporting event of the week was the Friday night fights at the Olympic Stadium , an entertainment that attracted the top movie stars and featured Lupe Velez screaming her lungs out at ringside . This era is recalled with the publication of a biography of Louis B. Mayer of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ( Hollywood Rajah , Henry Holt &; Co ? $5.50 ) , by Bosley Crowther , the motion picture critic of The New York Times . Mayer and his colleagues , Darryl Zanuck and Sol Wurtzel of 20th Century-Fox , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same attitudes and techniques that they utilized in their picturemaking . In short , they played to win . Mr. Wurtzel , for instance , made up his foursomes from the ranks of those writers and directors whose options were coming up . Mr. Wurtzel did not ; lose . Mr. Mayer , on the other hand , insured his own good showing by playing five balls from every tee ( he used three caddies ) and scoring himself on the best shot out of five on each hole . No sensible man , he used to tell his colleagues , would accept the ruinous odds of one-ball golf . Zanuck was an all-round athlete and a good one . He had to excel at every sport he took up . He had been a flyweight boxer in the Army , and to polish his style he often went a few rounds with the former world champion , Fidel La Barba , who was then on the studio payroll as a writer . Douglas Fairbanks , an incomparable natural athlete , brought Bull Montana , the wrestler , from the East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tab . Bing Crosby used to insist that a certain character was a consultant on every picture he made . The consultant 's only duty was to bring Bing the score by innings of all Pacific Coast League games played by the Stars of pre-Dodger days . A BEAR HUNT WITH THE BOSS Zanuck was as fearless as he was tireless in pursuing his sporting interests . Big-game hunting , skiing , boxing and croquet were among his other sports . An invitation to join Zanuck in a sporting holiday amounted to a command . Director William Wellman tells of what it was like to go on a bear hunt with the boss . " We went to British Columbia , " he said . " You had to shake the porcupines out of the trees at night . It snowed . We had to break trail for the horses . We were snowbound for three days . Zanuck chased a grizzly for 30 hours and came back with a sprained ankle . We forded various rivers 20 times . We lost the horses carrying our medicine . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damndest trip you 've ever seen . But you know what ? Zanuck loved it ! " In the beginning , Zanuck 's polo was a pickup sort of game on the A Hudkins ranch , which adjoined the Warner Brothers lot . But by enlisting such prime talent as Hector Do and Aidan Roark , Zanuck worked h ' team 's way up to the polo field at the Riviera Country Club and eventually to the Midwick Country Club in Pasadena , and it was at the latter tha someone remarked that Zanuck ha the only polo team on which the hors were better bred than the men . During Zanuck 's polo phase , he was accustomed to carrying a sawedoff polo mallet wherever he went and to use it as a prop in outlining or criticizing plots at story conferences . Naturally , lesser personalities on the Hollywood scene began to cast about for sporting gimmickry of their own . One writer took to carrying a putter into meetings , and another pounded a baseball glove and fielded imaginary grounders as he walked around the lot . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got nowhere . One day recently , sitting in the library of his home on Coldwater Canyon Drive in Beverly Hills , James Cagney recalled another writer who ran into the same difficulty . " This fellow , " Cagney said , getting up to demonstrate , " would pitch an entire ball game while he was ad-libbing a story idea to a producer and @#  | his staff . He 'd take his position in the center of the room , toss off a line like , Long shot of the city at night . ' Then he 'd bend over and look for the sign from the catcher who was n't there . Maybe he 'd shake off one or two as he tried to think of what to say next . Then there 'd be the big wind-up and throw and the shaking of his head and the kicking of the rubber at a bad call . Now he was ready to advance the story . Dissolve to medium shot of skyscraper , ' he might say , pan up to lighted window , dissolve to interior and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , still stalling for time , he might bend over and finger a nonexistent rosin bag . Or he 'd throw and run across the room to field a bunt . The more time he needed between the fragments of his story idea , the more exciting the game got . He was a great pantomimist . One day he acted out the whole business so vividly that when he announced that he had arrived at the big scene , a director yelled out , To hell with the big scene ! What 's the score ? ' " Cagney himself is a onetime ballplayer , having been the catcher for the Yorkville Nut Club , a boys ' team in the New York City neighborhood in which he grew up . It is doubtful , however , that the screenwriter 's gambit would have influenced the five-ball golfer , Mr. Louis B. Mayer . Mayer was as coldly realistic and humorless about sports and his adventures in horse racing as he was about his business . In 1937 , according to Crowther , Mayer was traveling royally through Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the schedule was a visit to a famous blood specialist of Amsterdam , Dr. Isidor Snapper . It was Schenck , not Mayer , who wanted to consult the doctor , but Mayer put himself down for a checkup to maintain equal status with Schenck . Before the touring potentates reached Amsterdam , word came that Dr. Snapper was fishing in Norway . Where Schenck and Mayer came from , there was always a way to resolve such disappointments . There was here , too . M-G-M 's European representative was called in and ordered to produce Dr. Snapper forthwith . The representative , a trained Hollywood operator , found that Dr. Snapper 's daughter was in love with a musician . The musician was offered a job in Hollywood on condition that he persuade the daughter to persuade the doctor to hurry home . It worked like a charm , and soon Dr. Snapper had finished with Schenck and was telling Mayer that while there was nothing organically wrong with him , he was rather tensed up and should relax more , possibly find a hobby . The doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing of Thoroughbred horses an interesting diversion . When Dr. Snapper happened to mention the Aga Khan as an example of a well-to-do horse fancier , Mayer perked up . To be mentioned in the same breath with the Aga Khan was status indeed for a man who had started as a junk dealer . Mayer bought his first horse from his dear friend , Joe Schenck , and , in the best Hollywood tradition of friendship , Schenck unloaded the worst horse in his stable on him , a dog named Marine Blue . Mayer bore Schenck no grudge but the transaction taught him that lie needed expert counsel . So he had an agent represent him at the Saratoga yearling sales , and a little later he purchased Main Man from Jerome B. Respess @# POLO PLAYER Darryl Zanuck ( left ) , here shown with stars Eric Martin , Aidan Roark and Laddie Sanford , played well and took the game into studio conferences with him . @# @#  | of California for $17,000 . When Main Man won the San Jose Handicap at Bay Meadows that winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle , he was thoroughly fascinated by his new business . It always was a business with Mayer . He ran his stable as he ran M-G-M . He expected both to show a profit . He had built M-G-M into the No. 1 studio by assembling Hollywood 's greatest lineup of stars . In racing , he decided to invest heavily in the most promising stock and bloodlines , and he confidently expected that equine stars would develop . Quite a few did . But before they did , Mayer also called upon the best exploitation techniques of the motion picture business . As an attentiongetter , he offered to buy Man o ' War , then standing in Kentucky , for $1 million . Samuel D. Riddle , the owner , replied that Man o ' War was not for sale at any price . Mayer also offered a million for the great English sire , Hyperion . Lord Derby , Hyperion 's distinguished owner , was horrified . " Though England be reduced to ashes , " he said , " Hyperion will never leave these shores . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in Busher , purchased from the late Colonel E. R. Bradley in 1944 . Busher won a total of more than $300,000 and was named Horse of the Year in 1945 , the second filly ever to win that title . It was along about this time that Mayer , searching for a pretty compliment to pay Greer Garson at a dinner , finally referred to the lovely M-G-M star as the Busher of motion pictures . Mayer himself was honored as the leading breeder in the country in 1945 by a vote of the New York Turf Writers . A few years later he decided to liquidate his stable . While he was in racing , says Biographer Crowther , Mayer was happy . Moreover , adds Crowther , he not only improved the breed ( especially in California ) , but he improved himself . The big men in the movies not only acquired sporting interests , but soon after rising to eminence began to pay more attention to their own physical fitness . Everybody who was anybody had his personal masseur and his pet exercises . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone was enough to make him watch his @# waistline . The nonperforming shots also seemed to fancy themselves as men of action who could settle any argument with their fists . Mayer himself is credited with having punched Samuel Goldwyn , Walter Wanger and Charlie Chaplin , as well as a number of lesser persons . Zanuck would fight anybody who crossed him at the drop of a hat . One memorable incident occurred when he was producing Public Enemy , the first of the Cagney gangster films . Zanuck was describing the big final scene to Jack Warner in the presence of Director Michael Curtiz . As old movie fans and young television addicts will recall , the scene has Cagney 's corpse delivered to his home . When the door bell is answered , the cadaver falls into the living room , a shocker of a finale . Warner thought it was too shocking , and asked Curtiz for his opinion . Curtiz said he was inclined to agree ? whereupon Zanuck hauled off and knocked him cold .

They are : 1 ) do n't get excited , 2 ) correctly remember balls you are dead on , 3 ) have patience with fellow members who are not as good as you are . THE BENEFITS OF CROQUET Recently , in the living room of his home behind the Beverly Hills Hotel , Mr. Goldwyn poured tea and spoke to the subject of physical fitness . He has been a lifelong devotee of long walks , simple exercises , daily massage and ? until Mrs. Goldwyn presented him with the two croquet courts as a wedding-anniversary gift ? an occasional game of golf . Mr. Goldwyn can not say enough for the benefits of exercise or the game of croquet . He credits his recovery from a recent injury to his powers of resistance developed over the years . He had wrenched his knee during a croquet game , but it did not begin to bother him until he went East . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the knee was imperative .

They were astounded to find Mr. Goldwyn ? who is 75 years o:1 ? struggling to his feet without assistance . Mr. Goldwyn made a sort speech to the staff on the benefits of keeping fit . if RASH WENT THE COLOR TV Later , having moved to the Waldorf-Astoria Towers , Mr. Goldwyn received a call from Mr. William Paley of the Columbia Broadcasting System . Over his protests , Paley had a color television set delivered to Mr. Goldwyn 's suite . Despite his distaste for television , Mr. Goldwyn became interested in it and when one program ended , he got up to switch to another channel . Once again , his knee gave way . This time , Mr. Goldwyn not only fell , he crashed heavily against Mr. Paley 's television set , smashing the picture tube to bits . Servants came running , but again - Mr. Goldwyn astounded them by getting to his feet without aid , and once again he delivered a short lecture on physical fitness . While telling the story in his Beverly Hills home , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assist him . He had made a complete recovery and would ( he said ) soon be ready for the croquet courts . Meanwhile , Hollywood will take note of other sporting diversions and be represented in force among the crowds of 90,000 that turn out for big league baseball and pro football . The present generation of stars and starlets will crowd the golf courses and the tennis courts and sail the blue Pacific . So much will be going on that ( as one of the Hollywood oldtimers put it ) even if the Dodgers lose the pennant , it will be forgotten in a week in the variety of feverish sporting activity in Los Angeles and at nearby Palm Springs . It 's all bigger ? and perhaps better ? but still it 's not quite like the bush-league days when a man could win any game through sheer determination ? and by putting the right people on the studio payroll .
