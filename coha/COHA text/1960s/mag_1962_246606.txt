It 's Only Money is the perfect title for a Jerry Lewis picture . His movies never mean anything more than money , and they never make anything less than a lot of it-none of the 26 films he has made has cost more than $2,000,000 , and all have grossed more than $5,000,000 . Money , as it happens , is a good deal better than most of them , and can conscientiously be recommended as a satisfactory substitute for thumbsucking , rattle-banging , kitchy-koo or water play . <P> Hee-Hee-Hero Jerry , a TV repairman whose knob is on the fritz , stands to inherit a billion dollars , but he does n't know it . An unscrupulous attorney ( Zachary Scott ) and his sinister sidekick ( Jack Weston ) know it very well , and they decide to make worm food of Jerry before Jerry finds out . The sidekick tries to run him down with his big , black , shark-shaped limousine-Jerry falls in a manhole just in time . The sidekick tries to prang him with a high-powered rifle-Jerry is so jerky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sights . The sidekick tries to blow him up along with a small sailboat-Jerry is snagged in the behind by a fishhook and yanked overboard three seconds before the boat explodes . <P> Best bit : Jerry , always helpful , grabs a fish pole from a lady angler when she gets a bite , yanks on it hard , loses the fish , staggers backward , tangles poles with another angler , staggers backward knocking over anglers , poles , bait buckets , lunch baskets and trash cans , till at last he winds up splat in the middle of the first **36;2068;TOOLONG snapshot ever taken with the subject 's head in the fish 's mouth .
