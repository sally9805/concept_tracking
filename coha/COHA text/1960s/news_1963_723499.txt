txt Letters to the Editor BURTON RAFFEL . Philadelphia.DAV1D ROSS . New York City.E.L. JR . New Yor ... Letters to the Editor In a letter to the editor published Sept. 29 , L. Rust Hills , fiction editor of Esquire magazine , complained about Mark Harris 's article ( Aug. 4 ) criticizing Esquire 's chart of " The Structure of the American Literary Establishment , " and observed : " Mark Harris 's attack on my chart made me think of some deaf old man , who , having failed to hear what was originally said , goes meandering along on an utterly different subject . " Mr. Harris and another reader have something further to say . TO THE EDITOR : I HEARD what Mr. Hills said . I I read what he " tried to show . " It 's what he did n't mean to show that 's the clue to it all . Let me repeat : " As a guide to the problems of Esquire magazine the chart is illuminating . " MARK HARRIS . San Francisco , Calif . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer who was listed , God knows how or why , among those at the red-hot center described by Rust Hills and Esquire , may I comment on Mr. Hills 's reply to Mark Harris : The point is not that Mr. Harris confused writing with publishing , but that Mr. Hills confused editors with writers . " The world of people who concern themselves with ' literary ' matters in America " ? the phrase is Mr. Hills 's ? is exclusively the province of the writer . The only literary man ( or woman ) is the writer . Editors ( and agents and publishers ) exist necause the writer does , and because the writer writes . The business concerns of editors ( and agents and publishers ) , their dealings in " properties , " and indeed all the money-changing of the literary market-place , are ( and if they 're not , then they should be ) foreign to the man creating , in " hard solitude , " what other people get rich on . My own reaction , incidentally , to being listed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then anger . I am acquainted with only one other writer who also got himself categorized in red : his observation was that it made him feel " slimy . " Surely , one of the greatest dangers facing American literature is this precise imposition of commercial values , this compulsion toward the dollar-and-cents test of values . We have already given birth to the non-book ; there are signs that our next " literary " parturition may well be the nonwriter author . Mr. Hills , though I know for a fact that he does not think so , is one of the many midwives . Mr. Harris , whatever his other merits and demerits , is on the side of the angels . BURTON RAFFEL . Philadelphia . Speaking of Books essay of August 11th as one that " echoes the voice of many critics of modern verse . " Please allow me to reject this dubious compliment , as well as the unwelcome association . I am not a critic of modern verse . On the contrary , I admire it , read it , teach it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought most of the verse done since the deaths of Thomas and Stevens was bad modern verse  --  bad not because it was " modern " but bad by the , at times , very high standards of this age ; bad because I totally agree with Coleridge 's profound observation that " bad writing was bad feeling " ; bad simply because it was bad poetry . I hold no brief for the sort of reader who , I think , confuses " obscurantism " with the legitimately difficult . What is worthwhile , if rare , is the ability to differentiate. : to be able to identify the finest work of any period . Only then is one 's opinion genuinely respectable . DAVID Ross . New York City . Tom O'Shanter TO THE EDITOR : . I N Speaking of Books ( SepI tember 15 ) J. Donald Adams skillfully guides his readers into the delights of Capt . Francis Grose 's " Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue " and ends , " How one would have liked to sit in on one of his sessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit in on one of these sessions , for one of Burns 's greatest poems , " Tam o ' Shanter , " was written , by request , for Grose 's " Antiquities of Scotland , " where it first appeared , as a footnote . ( Is n't that perhaps the grandest footnote ever writ-ten ? ) Ostensibly the poem " by my ingenious friend Robert Burns " is an anecdote about the abandoned and half ruined Kirk Alloway at Ayr , Burns 's birthplace . Actually it is nothing of the sort , but rather a morality tale in reverse , in which the sober wife is viewed with cold distaste , the virtues of whisky are fully explored , drunken Tam comes off scot-free , and only Modern Verse To THE EDITOR : WELCOME though praise should be , I was annoyed and embarrassed , rather than pleased , by Joseph Vulcan 's letter ( Sept. 22 ) hailing my his innocent mare loses most of her tail when a lovely young witch grabs at it . It takes no great imagination to see Captain Grose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local folklore to illustrate his book , and Burns spinning this superb poem ( he was a weaver ) from the whole cloth ? while Mrs. Burns waits at home " gathering her brows like gathering storm . " E. L. JR . New York City . Israeli Aid . To THE EDrroR : ISHOULD like to correct a misstatement that appeared in one Adams Schmidt 's recent review of " The United States and Israel " by Nada Safran . In that review Mr. Schmidt quotes Mr. Safran on the massive help the United States has given to the development of educational , cultural , social and philanthropic institutions in Israel and adds : " The 14-year price tag is $850,000,000 in U.S. Government aid , plus even larger sums in tax exempt ' charity ' through the United Jewish Appeal and bond drives , which flow straight into the general Israeli development budget . " No part of the funds of the WA flow into Israel 's development budget either directly or indirectly . USA funds are administered and transmitted by the Jewish Agency for Israel , Inc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transportation of needy Jewish refugees to Israel and for their absorption into the country . HERBERT A. FRIEDMAN . Executive Vice-Chairman , United Jewish Appeal . New York City . Bouquet To THE EDITOR : THANKS to Francis StedgI muller for " In a House in Westchester Lives Apollinaire 's Bluebird , " the most fascinating bit of reading I have come across in a long time .
