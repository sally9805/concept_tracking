California 's mild , patient Senator Tom Kuchel was fed up . A moderate Republican from the state where Chief Justice Earl Warren was once a Republican Governor , Kuchel was tired of getting obviously organized demands for the impeachment of Warren on the ground that he gave " aid and comfort to the Communist conspiracy . " By Kuchel 's triangulation , the attacks were inspired by the name-calling , semisecret John Birch Society* ( TIME . March 10 ) . which has made Warren 's impeachment its No. 1 goal . <P> On the Senate floor , Kuchel attacked the society by name , saving his hardest words for Founder and Leader Robert Welch , a retired candymaker and self-styled Americanist , who rates Harry Truman , John Foster Dulles and Dwight D. Eisenhower , among others , as Communist agents or dupes . " Good God , " roared Kuchel while rushing to Ike 's rescue , " should the American people and the American Government let that kind of spleen be poured upon one who has given his whole life to freedom ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough antiCommunist , joined in . Welch 's judgments , said he , are " an affront to decency and intelligence . ' ' <P> Surprisingly enough , not all Congressmen agreed . In Los Angeles , Arizona 's Barry Goldwater said : " A lot of people in my home town have been attracted to the society , and I am impressed by the type of people in it . They are the kind we need in politics . " Republican Congressman Edgar Hiestand of California called the attacks " a pro-Communist smear , " proudly noted that both he and John Rousselot , another California Republican , are Birchers . Ohio Republican Gordon Scherer , a member of the House Un-American Activities Committee , said that although he was not a member , he " looked favorably on this organization . " <P> Clearly , a lot more publicity was coming in the society 's direction . Kuchel and Congressman Henry Reuss , Wisconsin Democrat , called for a congressional investigation of Welch and his society . A spokesman for Attorney General Robert Kennedy said that the society 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department . " Across the land , newspapers began to print articles inquiring into Birch Society techniques in their own home towns . <P> That much public protest was more than Founder Welch had bargained for . At week 's end , he asked the Senate internal security subcommittee to investigate the society , piously promised that " none of our members will plead the Fifth Amendment . " He also denied that he had ever called Ike a " card-carrying Communist " or believed him to be a Red agent . " I never had that opinion ; I never thought it then with firmness enough to publish it or to say it in public , and I do n't today . " Of course , Robert Welch admitted , he had written a " private , confidential letter , " i.e. , his privately circulated book The Politician , " in which I stated some harsh personal opinions of our then President . " That harsh personal opinion : " Dwight Eisenhower is a dedicated , conscious agent of the Communist conspiracy . " <P>     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
