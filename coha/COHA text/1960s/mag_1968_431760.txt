 | America 's Hungry Families An estimated ten million persons in this . the world 's richest country , are hungry . Throughout the United States , in communities ranging from Chicago and Los Angeles to crossroad hamlets of the South , people eat dog food , paste , clay , laundry starch and dirt to appease their appetites . One of the major objectives of the Poor People 's Campaign in establishing Resurrection City in Washington , D. C. , last spring , was to awaken government officials and the general public to the existence of this widespread hunger in America . The general response to the cries of the starving poor has been bewilderment and disbelief . Many Federal bureaucrats and middle-class Americans alike , who know " hunger " only when they are trying to diet , found it hard to believe that significant numbers of their fellow citizens , in all parts of the nation and of all races , are tragically underfed . But Senator Joseph Clark of Pennsylvania , chairman of the Senate 's poverty subcommittee , charges that " no state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and children throughout the nation go to bed hungry , and awake in the morning with no hope of respite . " In mid-July , Senator Eugene J. McCarthy pointed to the Johnson Administration 's failure to save millions of Americans from starvation . " The responsibility rests with Administration policy and in particular with the U.S. Department of Agriculture ? with its inadequate administration , its arbitrary decision-making and its failure to make full use of Federal funds and Federal power , " Senator McCarthy said . " Hunger in America is a national disgrace . " Indeed , the Citizens ' Board of Inquiry into Hunger , a highly respected private investigating organization , set out to document the degree of hunger and malnutrition in the United States ( a subject that has never been studied on a broad scale ) . After ten months of public hearings and field inspections , the CBIH , last April , estimated that , " conservatively speaking , " ten times the original estimate of one million ? or one out of every twenty persons in this country ? have insufficient food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " hunger districts " where extreme rates of poveverty " , and infant mortality , coupled with a dearth of relief pr= grams , suggest that hunger has reached " emergent. proportions . Doctors in Baltimore have found the mean hemoglobin - concentration in 800 children from poor families to lower than that of infants in rural Pakistan . Surveys Seattle and Washington , D. C. , show that from fifty seventy-five percent of babies from low-income families suffer iron-deficiency anemia . Physicians in at least three states ? Florida , New York and Arizona ? have recently discovered cases of kwashiorkor , a protein-deficiency disease prevalent in underdeveloped countries . A San Antonio charity hospital so frequently finds anemia among expectant mothers that it routinely gives blood transfusions in prenatal care ; youngsters often are brought into this same hospital weighing less at the age of one than they did at birth . A canvass of schoolchildren in a " moderately impoverished " area of New York City reveals that more than seven out of ten have inadequate diets . Interviews with migrant workers in Florida have established that more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow vegetables and that ninety-seven percent get less than half the recommended allowances of milk and dairy products . After touring the Mississippi Delta last year , a group of six physicians reported to Congress , " In child after child , we saw evidence of vitamin and mineral deficiencies , unattended bone diseases , bacterial and parasitic disease , as well as severe anemia . The boys and girls we saw were hungry , weak , in pain , sick , visibly and predictably losing their health , their energy , their spirits . They are suffering from hunger and disease , and directly or indirectly they are dying from them . " Incredibly , we seem to have been going downhill in our attempts to solve the problem . The U.S. Department of Agriculture , last March , announced that its sampling of family dietary levels indicates that a higher proportion of American families is poorly fed today than ten years ago . Shortly before the Poor People 's Campaign hit the headlines , we went on an intensive cross-country investigation of hunger for Good Housekeeping . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we met . Some , as a matter of continued on page 182f  |p182f  personal dignity will not admit to hunger . Others may not be aware of its depth , for , since the time of birth , they have never had enough to eat . For the most part , these families are beyond the reach of our welfare systems . The War on Poverty is not meaningfully touching their lives . Government food-relief programs are failing to bring them even minimally adequate diets . The families described are real ; their names are not . In some cases , minor circumstances may have changed since we saw them , but their oppressive problems remain . These families are by no means the most desperate we found . Rather , their experiences and ways of life are representative of ten million or more American citizens ? the middle range of the whole group of the hungry . When you read their stories , one set of facts is important to keep in mind : According to the Agriculture Department , an " adequately nourished " American family of four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of groceries . In addition to milk and eggs , such a family each month should consume 308 pounds of nutritious food , including fifty pounds of meat , poultry or fish and 176 pounds of fruit and vegetables . @# Three or four times every month in Des Moines , Iowa , capital city of the nation 's " breadbasket , " Ann S. and her husband , Peter , go out to the city dump and forage for food . They have raised four children to adulthood , lost one to stillbirth and another in infancy , and are now trying to keep alive three more still at home , boys eleven and three , and a girl of ten . " That old dump has pulled us through more than one week , believe me , " says Mrs. S. , a friendly , faded woman of forty-five , with sad brown eyes and stringy hair . " We find frozen stuff there that had started to thaw in the stores and was tossed out . It all tastes okay . " " Hustling " the dump within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one of the ironies of their lives . Until recently , members of the S. family , who are white , lived in a section of town called the Southeast Bottoms where , just a few blocks from the fancy stores and offices of Des Moines ' main business district , the streets are still muddy lanes , many residents use turnbledown privies and the only city water most receive is from a public drinking trough . Now the family lives at the edge of town in a cramped five-room frame house without indoor toilet facilities or running water . Although they are virtually in the suburbs , their style of living has not appreciably improved . The family is ineligible for virtually all welfare assistance because Peter , fifty-one , is able-bodied and steadily employed ? so steadily , in fact , that he has worked the same job six days a week for eleven years without missing a day . The job is " busting suds , " dishwashing , in a Des Moines private club Though he bicycles ten miles roundtrip to work to cut costs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : school at age eleven to work in an Iowa coal mine ? roughly $220 a month ? it is not enough . By the time rent , loan installments and other obligations are paid , Mrs. S has left for food about fifteen dollars week , three dollars for each member o her family . During the summer the money goes somewhat harder because two of her children receive free ho : lunches on weekdays at school only during the school year . The day we first visited them was the couple 's twenty-ninth wedding anniversary . The celebration dinner was steaming on the ancient gas range ? e pot of red beans . Cheap and filling . beans have for years been the mainstay of the family 's diet . The beans have taken their toll in more than monotony . Eleven-year-old Edward , a thin , shy blond , suffers from an enlarged bowel , and during the last five years he has experienced scores o : humiliating accidents at home and a : school , " just like a baby in diapers , " his mother says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that his heavy intake of beans , often laced with lard , margarine or gravy , contributed to his lack of bowel control . They prescribed leafy vegetables , fruit juices and meat .  | " They said my other kids were all run-down , too , " Mrs. S. explains , and highly susceptible to colds and infections . She has been granted a $10-amonth medical allotment by the local welfare office for foods to supplement Edward 's diet . She says his condition is improving . " But ten dollars a month does n't buy much , and what I bring home for him I 've got to spread around . I just ca n't have the other kids sit there and watch him eat . " Aside from the city dump , the biggest " extra " source of food for the S. family is the commodities distribution program , one of two food-relief projects sponsored by the Federal government for poor families . At the time of our visit , Peter was stopping once a month at the welfare office and picking up about 115 pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Agriculture Department has in surplus because of its vast purchases to stabilize farm prices . These commodities , shipped from Agriculture warehouses , usually include such items as cornmeal , lard , rolled oats , cracked wheat , flour and nonfat dry milk . Nationwide , about 3,200,000 persons receive commodities , and for many they are the main if not the only source of food . A family the size of Peter 's gets about thirty-five dollars worth of surpluses free , but the supplies fall far short of providing an adequate diet . Fresh fruits and meats , deep green and yellow vegetables , fresh eggs , potatoes and sugar are never distributed . The surpluses that are given out are deficient in such essential nutrients as vitamins A and C and afford fewer than half the calories a family needs . Most plentiful are starches and carbohydrates . The heaviest items in the S. family 's box each month , for example , are twenty pounds of flour , fifteen pounds of cornmeal and rolled wheat and ten pounds of beans . By contrast , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds of raisins and nine and a half pounds of canned chopped meat . ( This summer , in response to pressures brought by the Poor People 's Campaign and the CBIH , Agriculture Department officials promised to begin making available to welfare agencies an additional six nonsurplus items with the commodities , including canned vegetables , bottled fruit juices , a scrambled-egg mix , canned chickens , an instant milk drink and evaporated milk . ( Iowa authorities told us they plan to distribute some of these new items , including for a family the size of Ann and Peter 's , sixty ounces of egg mix , fifteen pounds of chicken , five cans of vegetables and five bottles of fruit juice . Even if Iowa had accepted all the new foods offered , a decision left up to state officials , each family 's allotment would still fall below minimum dietary standards for calcium , iron and vitamins C and A. ( Moreover , the additions may be only temporary . An Agriculture spokesman told us that prices and normal market demands for these products may at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In any event , as GOOD HOUSEKEEPING went to press , none of the promised new items had arrived in Des Moines . ) As for the free foods the S. family is receiving , Agriculture Secretary Orville Freeman has conceded , " It is difficult for even a highly skilled cook to prepare from thirteen individual commodities the variety of dishes which the average housewife can make from the thousands of food products in today 's grocery store . " Yet no recipes , cooking instructions or nutrition tips come with the surpluses , although Federal officials promised some months ago to begin printing recipes on the packages . The family often winds up at mealtime with bread and gravy , or with what Mrs. S. calls " fried bread , " a mixture of lard , flour and baking powder . " No matter what I do , " she told us , " the commodities always run out about the third week of the month . The meat ? well , the meat goes right away . " With the family wage earner a man at middle age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finer skill than dishwashing , Ann S. , who herself never finished grade school , looks forward to no improvement in her future . " It 's been like this for twenty-nine years now , " she told us , " and I suppose it will keep on being . " @# Forty miles from the Old South ele-@#  | gance of Charleston , South Carolina , in a windowless shack worth perhaps thirty-five dollars as firewood , Nancy M. has never known a day when she had enough food . Every night , to feed her husband , Bill , herself and their six children , ages six months to seven years , she prepares a dinner of spaghetti and rice , beans or potatoes . Leftovers are reheated for breakfast . There rarely is anything for lunch . " Sometimes Bill and I skip eating altogether , " says Mrs. M. , a thin , nervous woman of twenty-six , " but I always try to give the kids something . " " A little more regular than once a month " the family has " store-bought " meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season and he has money for shells , Bill tries to enrich this fare by hunting . " The rabbits are about all shot out of these woods , " he says . " Sometimes in the swamp , though , I can get us a turtle or a crow . " A personable , soft-spoken Negro of twenty-five , Bill is a tenant farmer for the same white family that employed his father and Nancy 's father all their working lives . On days when there is work for him , he is in the fields by seven o'clock . He quits when it gets too dark to see . His pay is four dollars a day . " If it starts to rain halfway through , " says Nancy . " he gets two . " ( The farm does not utilize enough labor to be governed by the Federal minimum-wage law . ) In a week , Bill averages sixteen dollars . Because he is not blind , aged or disabled , under South Carolina law , as in most states , his income can not be supplemented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations throughout the United States , an estimated three out of four poor Americans receive no welfare assistance . ) The family has fire and little else . The night we called , they were huddled together on the shack 's rotting floor ; the three cell-sized rooms were heavy with smoke from an old wood-burning heater . The only light in the place comes from a kerosene lamp . For water , Mrs. M. hikes half a mile to an old well . The nearby woods is their toilet . They sleep , the eight of them , on a double bed and a tattered couch with exposed springs . Their dinnerware consists of two plates and two forks someone gave them . The children either eat with their hands , out of pot lids , or wait turns for the utensils . Except for the rent they pay to Bill 's boss ? fifteen , dollars a month , nearly one-fourth their income ? virtually all the family 's money goes for food . They get no help from the government . Federal food relief programs usually are offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July there was no program whatever in Bill and Nancy 's county , even though antipoverty officials had reported some 1,800 families there earning less then $1,000 a year , and nearly 3,700 ? more than half the population ? making less than $3,000 . " I guess we were just lazy about it , " the county welfare director told us . Now , seven years after it was first made available to counties by the Federal government , a food stamp program has gotten under way there . The food stamp plan , which Agriculture Department officials are now urging many counties to adopt in preference to the free food distribution of the commodities program , has about 2,200,000 participants nationwide . Under it , poor families like Bill 's buy food coupons once a month at the local welfare office . The coupons , worth more than they cost , can be spent like cash at specified grocery stores and are ultimately redeemed by the Federal government . The value of the stamps a family receives and the amount they are charged for them depends on the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about twenty-six dollars a month and get stamps worth eighty-eight dollars in groceries . As GOOD HOUSEKEEPING went to press , only about 500 families were enrolled in the plan and Bill and Nancy 's was not among them . Like many of their neighbors , they keep alive on credit . The only place that will carry their account is a tiny filling station-store down the road , so they have traded there exclusively for as long as they can remember , even though the prices are higher than they would be in a supermarket . They are never told their total debt , nor are they given receipts . " Whatever we pay , the people just say we owe ' em more , " Mrs. M. explains . " And they ration us . If we say we need three pounds of neck bones to keep going , they give us two . " The store is not authorized to accept food stamps . Another store three miles away is , but Bill and Nancy , through the devices of fear and coercion , are prohibited from taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the nearer store . Consequently , at last report , they have not signed up for food stamps . Even if they did , they are fifteen miles from the welfare office where the stamps must be picked up and three miles from where they can be spent , and the family has no car . Also , there is the monumental problem of accumulating twenty-six dollars in cash at one time . Bill M. would like to plant a garden , not only for the variety and quantity of food it would allord , but to lessen his dependence on the little store . But his boss , whose relatives operate the store , has refused to give up land for the project . The one member of the family who is at least within touching ? though not eating ? distance of a balanced meal five times a week is seven-year-old Matilda . Her all-Negro school has a hot-lunch program , financed by Federal education funds . But nearly half the 200 pupils are from poverty families and , the principal told us , the budget allows only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school officials judge to be the poorest . At noontime , Matilda M. and a number of her classmates , who are not among the select twenty-five but who are rarely able to bring even a dime for food , sit by while other " less fortunate " children eat . continued on page 186 @#  | Like the offspring of other hungry families , the M. youngsters seem listless and eerily quiet . Skinny , with distended stomachs , they spend much of the day sitting down , sleeping or huddling around their mother . Two years ago , after Matilda had had fits of screaming and fainting , Bill and Nancy discovered that she had worms . " I think the others have got ' em , too , " Bill says . But because of the costs involved , Matilda is the only child ever to have been in the presence of a doctor or a nurse . Until recently , Mrs. M. had never even heard of birth control . She just accepted her pregnancies and with each conception began eating laundry starch to " build up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a process that is not clearly understood , starch eating seems to produce iron-deficiency anemia . ) Now she is interested in getting more familyplanning information before she has other mouths to feed . But a new birth control program launched by the county health department seems to be making slow headway . In this county containing 3,700 poor families , the department in its first year of operation has supplied intrauterine devices to only eighty-eight impoverished women , the welfare director told us . Whether the coils were properly explained even to these women seems open to question . We learned of one case in which a young recipient informed her husband that she could no longer engage in sexual intercourse " because the health people put a machine inside me . " He beat her until she agreed to have nothing more to do with birth control . Bill and Nancy M. feel trapped in a hopeless way of life . They know a man who makes a living driving Negro families to New York in an old Buick . The ride costs twenty dollars a head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of debt so they could leave , Bill is wise enough to know he has neither the sophistication nor the education to take on the city successfully . Except for a visit to northern Florida as a child , he has never been farther from his claustrophobic shack than Charleston . He never went a day to school because his father needed him in the fields . Since she married him , Nancy , who finished seventh grade , has taught him to write his name . The cost of hunting for the few nonfarm jobs in South Carolina available to illiterate , unskilled Negroes is prohibitive . To hitch a ride with a neighbor even to the nearest village , little more than a post office and a general store , could cost Bill one dollar each way . To Charleston it 's five dollars . Not long ago , Bill hoped to enroll in a work-training program established by the South Carolina Commission for Farm Workers . But the project , he discovered , is designed primarily to aid those who work seasonally for more than one employer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this writing , the War on Poverty , which might be expected to help Bill get the training he needs , has nothing more to offer in his county than two " neighborhood service workers " whose job it is to " counsel " the 3,700 poor families on such matters as housekeeping and personal hygiene . In his desperation to feed his family . there are two things Bill M. has not yet tried . One is to abandon them , the other to put his old squirrel rifle to his head and pull the trigger . With him dead or gone , Nancy and the children would he eligible for a monthly welfare check of $125 , more than double what Bill is able to earn ; indeed , more money than they have ever seen at one time . III High on a windswept mesa in northern Arizona , inside a mud-and-log hogan where the children sleep in sheepskins on the dirt floor , Janet K. pointed to five thin strips of fat hanging from a wire . " That 's our meat , " she told us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-five-pound sack of flour that 's going down . When it 's gone , I do n't know what we 'll do . " Probably her husband , Paul , will have to slaughter another sheep from the small herd he tends on the rocky desert , she explained . But that will mean more hunger in the long run . For it was lambing time , and from selling the lambs and wool , Paul and Janet , parents of three boys and three girls ranging in age from three to sixteen , make the bulk of their income ? about $750 a year . Occasionally , Mrs. K. a lean , softspoken woman who looks far older than her thirty-three years , can supplement this by making an Indian rug that will bring , perhaps , forty dollars at a trading post . But by the time she cards and spins the wool , blends vegetable dyes and weaves a pattern on her hand loom , the pay works out to about thirty cents an hour . What helps out most , Mrs. K. says , is the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Utah and three other children attend a Navajocontrolled boarding school at Rough Rock , a tiny settlement about twelve miles away . Not only does this lessen the daily food demand , but when the children come home from Rough Rock on weekends , they also bring along small bags of fruit . The rest of the time , the four members of the family who are left at home manage somehow to survive on two meals a day of fried bread and black coffee , cooked on an old oil drum Mrs. K. uses as a wood-burning stove . Of the 19,300 families on this Navajo reservation , more than 18,500 ? ninetysix percent ? earn less than $3,000 a year , according to the Office of Navajo Economic Opportunity . Over 15,000 , like the K. family , make less than $1,000 , with the average family income about 8600 . Only fifteen percent of the population is permanently employed , and this includes men like Paul K. who scratch out a few hundred dollars herding sheep . Seven out of ten dwellings are substandard . Many are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without water , electricity or outhouses . Of every one hundred babies   born on the reservation , forty-five die in infancy . ( In their seventeen years of marriage , Paul and Janet have lost four . ) Now the Navajo tribe itself is going broke . In its efforts to help its people with scholarships , clothing , welfare programs , windmills and other reservation improvements , the tribe is incurring expenses ten - million - dollars - a - year greater than its income , which comes mainly from oil and gas leases and royalties . Last February , in hopes of getting more return on their cash reserves , tribal leaders began investing in the stock market . Such high finance is beyond the comprehension of most Navajo women , many of whom have never been to school and must make a thumbprint for their " signatures . " A more real problem in Janet 's struggle to feed her family is that of the vast , raw distances of the Southwest sheep country . The nearest supermarket is in Gallup , New Mexico , almost 150 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family 's faltering old pickup truck means forty-one cents less available for food . So , for all practical purposes , Mrs. K. is restricted to shopping at reservation trading posts run by white men . " They give us a little credit , " she says . But a welfare worker told us that trading-post prices " always are ten to fifty percent higher than those in a supermarket . " An official at the Rough Rock school recalls that he tried a few years ago to start a grocery store that would sell food to Indian families at slightly above cost . " The trading-post operators brought so , much pressure on the wholesalers that they refused to supply me , " he claims . " I had to give up . " The long distances and primitive roads , that are often impassable because of snow or rain , have also helped make the Federal surplus commodities program for the reservation highly erratic . Because their income is well below the poverty line and all their assets total far less than the limit of $1,200 , the K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food distribution of the government commodities program . " But nobody tells us when the food will be given out , " Mrs. K. says . Sometimes weather conditions prevent distribution altogether . Three times in recent months Mrs. K. has managed to get to the distribution site on the right day only to find that the supplies had run out . Only twice in the last year has she come home with any commodities , she says , and then only partial allotments . " They do n't seem to last much more than a week . " " For some reason , " the woman who administers the program from the tribal headquarters at Window Rock told us , " our shipments from the government do n't include as much as they 're supposed to . We get no dairy products except dry milk . Lard stops coming in the warm weather . We run out of chopped meat and other essentials fairly regularly . Last January we got only three items to begin with ? flour , cornmeal and raisins . Twenty-six hundred people in the eastern half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unserved entirely . " Even if Paul and Janet received everything to which they are entitled , at this writing they would get less than twenty dollars worth of basic foods for the month . Officials who figure the family 's allotment do not allow for the four children who are away at school , even though three of them eat at home on weekends . For the same reasons that Bill and Nancy M. are ineligible for state welfare in South Carolina , Paul and Janet K. are ineligible in Arizona , and their efforts to otherwise boost their income have met only bitter frustration . Last fall , Paul landed a janitor 's job at the Rough Rock school , paying $1.50 an hour . But because so many Indian men are desperate for employment , he was allowed to work only six weeks before the job was rotated to someone else . His turn in a rotating work-relief program sponsored by the Navajo tribe , which would give him ten days ' employment this year , had not come up at the time of our visit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area . For two summers , all the family members old enough to work hired out as stoop labor in the sugar-beet fields of Idaho . Recruiters who canvassed the reservation promised them a house with running water and a toilet and a guarantee of forty dollars a week or more . When they got to the migrant camp , they found a windowless shack for which they were charged rent and an outhouse that served forty persons . Because of the language barrier , Paul and Janet were never sure of their rate of pay . " When a whole acre was weeded , we 'd get a few dollars , " Mrs. K. told our interpreter . By the end of each season , " we had enough for bus fare home . " When we asked her what she saw in the future for her family , Janet just shrugged . Then she squatted by the oildrum stove , tossed in a few pieces of pinon wood that Paul had driven ten miles to find on the barren desert , lifted a tub of water he had carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag of flour to begin her evening meal of fried bread . She had decided to save the sheep fat until things got really bad . IV Lila D. , a thin , drawn housewife of thirty-three. buys her family 's food from a budget which would look like luxury to many hungry Americans . At the time of our visit , the Boston Welfare Department , on the first and fifteenth of each month , was sending $160 to Lila , her ailing husband Pedro and their three boys and three girls , ages six through twelve . From this , they pay twenty-three dollars a week rent , ninety cents a week for the children 's school milk money and all other family expenses . As Bostonians , the D. family shares in one of the most generous welfare systems in the United States , but as newly arrived Puerto Ricans , they are strangers in a land whose customs and language they do not understand . And they are the unknowing victims of their isolated world . the urban ghetto . So , often spending more than $200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the day the welfare check arrives at the neat threeroom tenement flat in Boston 's polyglot South End . Lila spends most of her grocery money . A Spanish market where the foods are familiar is on the same crowded block . A half-mile away is a chain store where prices are lower , but only English is spoken there . Across the railroad tracks , out of the ghetto , in a totally different world that frightens Lila , are chain stores and food markets of the white neighborhoods where prices are lower still . Lila almost always shops at the Spanish market . " The market man gives us credit , " Lila says . " He gets mad if we do n't buy everything from him . And we need the credit . " With her shopping habits , credit is an important weapon in Mrs. D 's battle of the budget . Since the family arrived in Boston from their Puerto Rican country village last year , they have been in constant debt to the grocer . Now , each time he cashes the welfare check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extends them a little more credit . Lila is never sure exactly how much she owes , but estimates the amount at " around thirty dollars . " Mrs. D. knows she should serve her family well-bal-  | anced meals . She knows her growing children need sou nutrition , but she does n't know how things are done big , busy Boston . And no one tells her . She is not aware that foods are cheaper in season or in non-ghetto neighborhoods . Because she can not read English , grocery ads mean nothing ; she does not know about sales . She does not compare relative costs of fooxs bought in various forms . She comes from an environment where women pick fruits and vegetables off plants and trees and serve them , so , since no one has taught her otherwise , she shops for groceries in essentially the saint manner . Prices in the Spanish grocery are frequently unmarked . She makes her selections , hands over her moray and pockets whatever change is given her . She buys the foods she knows , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She buys tomatoes , banana N. sometimes avocados , and , for the first week after the check arrives , the D. family eats almost enough . Breakfast is bread , coffee and an egg or bowl of oatmeal apiece . For lunch , each child gets a jelly or cheese sandwich , milk and an occasional piece of fruit , while Lila an Pedro have spaghetti , sometimes with meat sauce , and potatoes . Dinner for the eight of them is usually one pound of beans with a fried lard base , three cups of rice . pork chop or hamburger apiece , two potatoes Frenn fried , and a salad with four tomatoes . Then the family 's food starts running out . Breakfast . s cut back to coffee alone . The children take only a sandwich to school , and dinner is rice and beans with maybe a pound of chops .

" I have to throw things away a lot , " she says , " se we try to eat it before that happens . " Lila and Pedro 's furnished apartment consists of a smal. bedroom , a bathroom , a living room and a narrow , almost : closet-sized kitchen . The parents and four of the children sleep in four single beds in the bedroom , while the others share the living-room sofa . As long as they can remember , Lila and her husband have been struggling to keep themselves and their family fed . Forty-one-year-old Pedro , a frail man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six summers travelirz from his Puerto Rican village to New Jersey to work the . tomato harvest .

Despite the language barrier and the fact that , like his wife , Pedro had attended only three years of school , he quickly found a job carrying and weighing heavy packages in a mattress factory for $1.60 an hour . In a few weeks he got better work sorting laundry . With an optimistic eye to the future , he borrowed $520 from his friend and sent for Lila and the children . Soon after they arrived , Pedro took sick with " pains in the stomach . " Doctors at the city hospital prescribed ulcer medication and treated him and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his English-speaking boss . he was fired for missing work on the day he visited the hospital , still owing his friend the full $520 . Before he could find another job , he was hit by a car while crossing the street , sustaining shoulder and head injuries which . coupled with the persisting stomach pains , have virtually incapacitated him for manual labor , the only kind of work he knows how to do . Like many of the other Puerto Ricans in the South End . the D. family went on relief . 190  | When we saw them , the family was awaiting their first anniversary as Massachusetts residents , when they would become eligible for increased benefits under the state 's Aid to Families with Dependent Children and Unempioyed Fathers program , which would mean a total of about $400 each month . They will not , however , be the recipients of any more orientation in urban living or consumer education . The Boston Welfare Department offers no such instruction to its welfare cases . The only effort the department has made in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dollar , " offered last spring for two weeks . Fifty-six women out of a total department caseload of 58,000-were chosen to participate . The course was not offered in Spanish . V John and Sally 's rickety old cabin sits in a hollow of th .. Cumberland Mountains , twenty miles from Whitesburtz . Kentucky . The day we visited the R. family , John had just giver . their fourteen-year-old boy their last dollar to buy a gallon of milk in hopes of easing his wife 's pain . Sally had been awake all night , screaming in the agony of what John diagnosed as an attack of severe arthritis . Now she lay on one of the three beds jammed around a coal stove in the cabin 's drab main room , her left arm and leg paralyzed . A new pain was tearing at the inside of her stomach : Sally has ulcers , but because she can not afford the special diet her doctor has prescribed , she had eaten for breakfast the only food in the house : biscuits and gravy . " Ohhhh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ohhhhh . God , I 'll starve before I ever eat that again ! " " She is starving , " John said softly . " The doctor said her blood is n't no more than a strawberry drink . But I ca n't afford better for her than we got . " Sally R. is a wisp of a woman with sunken cheeks . lusterless blonde hair , rotting teeth and skeletal limbs . She looks sixty . She is thirty-five and pregnant with her fourth child . She has two boys , eight and fourteen , and a girl , eleven . and has suffered one miscarriage . John , gray and toothless at thirty-six , has given most of his working life to the coal in the mountains around them . Until last year , he made twelve dollars each day he could find work swinging a No. 4 shovel in small , nonunion truck mines , hand-loading eight tons of coal a day into shuttle cars . A good year made him $1,500 . But now stripmining machines are moving in . Without the bother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountainside from the surface , one machine peels back the top of a mountain and gulps out coal faster than ten men could . Like thousands of other able-bodied men througho- : - the Appalachian coal fields , John was out of work arc we saw him . He had applied for welfare on the grour. ; : - that Sally 's illness constituted a permanent disability . H hoped to be granted as much as forty-six dollars a mont ' . - . to care for her . ( Kentucky has no general welfare program for families with unemployed fathers . ) Welfare officials , however , denied the application , so , except for an occasional three-dollar-a-day odd job , he had no money coming in . He hoped that in the months ahead . seasonal sawmill work would open up , but he knew the pay would be low . Complicating matters for the family is Sally 's need for a special diet . Her doctor has given John two mimeographed pages of recommended balanced menus for every meal , featuring plentiful broiled or baked meat or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including at least six glasses of milk a day . Strictly forbidden are the foods she has eaten all her life , such as fried fatback and greasy gravy . As might be expected , good health has been a stranger at the R. shack for a long time . Sally says the youngest boy George , is anemic . Last year , she remembers . " he started vomiting and passed clumps of worms as big as golf balls . " The other youngsters , too , have received worm treatment . All are rail-thin , and are having increasing difficulty keeping pace in school . Sally says . " Many times @# 191  | the kids say to me , Ma , I feel like I 'm starvin ' to death . ' " " I wo n't buy food on credit , " John says , " because I know I wo n't be able to pay it back . " So what keeps the R. family alive is the Federal food stamp plan and the schoollunch program . And for them . the latter seemed in jeopardy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a tight lunch budget , had announced he might have to cut off free food for the R. children on the grounds that they live close enough to walk home for lunch . With little or no income , John and his family are entitled to food stamps worth sixty dollars in groceries at a cost of $2.50 a month . How he is to get even $2.50 in the months when he makes nothing is his problem to solve . Agriculture Secretary Freeman has asked county governments to finance stamps for moneyless families , but we encountered no instance where this is being done . The abjectness of the R. family 's poverty entitles them to less food under the stamp program 's sliding-rate schedule than families who are better off . If John were making $250 a month , for example , he would pay seventytwo dollars a month for stamps worth ninety-four dollars , one-third more than he is getting . " The Agriculture Department , " one critic observes . " apparently believes that the poorer you are , the less you are entitled to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not get as hungry as those whose parents are better off . " Recently , the wife of a Whitesburg newspaper editor conducted an experimental shopping trip on a minimum stamp allotment . She discovered that poor families like the R. family need nearly twice the value of stamps they are getting to meet even the Agriculture Department 's own low-budget recommendations for a minimally adequate diet . Her shopping , incidentally , was done in a city supermarket . Prices at the country store where John and Sally buy groceries average ten to twenty-five percent higher . Also , she was not shopping with the special needs of a sick woman in mind . " When we get the stamps , " John says , " I try to stock in as much as possible of what Sally needs . I get some chicken , some canned vegetables . Jello . To stretch it , we only eat breakfast and supper . The kids get lunch at school , and here at home we give ' em flour gravy , bread and pinto beans . Sometimes they eat the scraps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take long for her diet stuff to go , though , no matter what we do . A week or so maybe . Then she tries to keep going on the eggs our hens lay . But we only got six hens and some are old , so we get about two eggs a day . There are times she 's just so hungry she 's got to eat what she 's not supposed to , and just try to take the pain . " Last year , in hopes of brightening his family 's future , John R. , who has an eighth-grade education , enrolled in a job-training program sponsored by the State Division of Vocational Education and the U. S. Department of Labor . For six months , he went to class from 3:45 P.m. until midnight to learn plumbing , painting , carpentry , and electrical techniques , and was paid about $240 a month . The program is regarded by John and the seventeen other men involved as a dismal failure . " We did n't have the tools for carpentry to fight our way out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We did n't have enough lumber for everyone to build something that mattered , so we built mostly what-not shelves . For plumbing , they showed us how to work a blowtorch . We did n't even learn how to put a sink together . We got electrical training by wiring a three-way socket and finding a short in a cord . When we were finished , we did n't know no more than when we started . " Even if the training had been successful , the men would have had difficulty in making it pay off . Aside from coal and occasional sawmills , industry is virtually nonexistent in Appalachia . Many of John and Sally 's neighbors have moved to places like Chicago and Detroit . But reports filtering back to Kentucky indicate that conditions , in the big cities for . unschooled , unskilled " hillbillies " are far from ideal . too . So , like thousands of others , John R. and his family stay in the hills of home , and go hungry . They have company in their misery . According to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding tour of eastern Kentucky not long before his assassination , more than half the families there are below the poverty line , with median family income less than half the national median . Nearly seventy percent of the housing in the R. family 's county is unsound and lacking plumbing , and nearly thirty percent of the population is functionally illiterate . The big coal companies in the East which take out millions of tons of the state 's best natural resource pay not a cent in special taxes for depleting the resource ? money that might be used to benefit native Kentuckians . Furthermore , the increasing prevalence of strip mining is now destroying the scenic landscape , and with it the hope of tourism as a major industry . ? ' About all we can look forward to here are funerals , " says John , " and we do n't have the money to pay for those . " While we were in the R. family 's cabin they were visited by a nurse from VISTA , the domestic Peace Corps . She recommended that Mrs. R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay home . " I ai n't gain ' , " she kept saying . " I was there before and the nurses were mean . " When you considered her condition , she appeared stubborn and unreasonable . Then , as the nurse insisted , Sally dissolved suddenly into racking sobs , and something deeper burst out . " How do you think it makes me feel , " she gasped through her tears , " when they bring me a big old hospital tray loaded with food ? and I know my kids are back here starving ! " Although the U.S. government has financed scores of nutrition studies in other countries , not until this year has there been a comprehensive government study to determine the extent and effects of food deficiency here . The results of this survey , now being conducted by the Public Health Service , will not be reported until the end of this year . but it is already obvious that our present programs for dealing with the problem of hunger in America fall far short of the needs . Secretary Orville Freeman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July , pointed out : " In 1968 our combined Food Stamp and Commodity Distribution Program reaches 6.1 million in 2,400 counties . Of these 1,000 lowest income counties , all but forty have either begun or are now developing food assistance programs . In these forty counties , the Department of Agriculture is taking steps to operate a program independently of local authority . " However , at this writing there are more than 500 counties in the nation where food stamp and commodities programs are unavailable and unscheduled . As of last July , another 280 counties had requested food stamp programs but were unable to get them because of lack of available Federal fund . Surplus commodities and food stamps are not providing adequate diets to those who receive them . Agriculture Department officials , who appear to take action only when pressures are intense , promised last summer to try to incorporate into the programs special high-protein foods for expectant mothers and the aged , and to explore ways of distributing domestically the kinds of fortified foods that have been sent to hungry peoples abroad for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the government programs . Aside from official apathy , money is a problem . The sixbillion-dollar reduction in the Federal budget required by last June 's surcharge tax bill may tighten things even more . A New York Times analyst has speculated that the six billion dollars " almost entirely will come out of programs primarily designed to help the poor . " Even the money that is available has not always been wisely spent . Congressional investigating committees recently discovered that the Agriculture Department over the last seven years has returned $881 million to the Treasury unspent ? money that could have been used to feed the nation 's hungry . Welfare programs in the vast majority of states are insufficient to provide nutritious meals . " In over half the states , " says the Citizens ' Board of Inquiry into Hunger . " welfare is set at levels far below those determined as minimally adequate for subsistence . " Aid to Dependent Children in Mississippi , for example , provides S9.25 a month per child . ( According to The New York Times . the @#  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campaign , pointed out that , in the same state , James O. Eastland is paid $13,000 per month in Federal crop-control subsidies " for not growing food " on his Sunflower County Plantation . ) Even where allotments are more realistic , the lack of consumer education , as in the case of Lila and Pedro D. , permits serious flaws in the system . As GOOD HOUSEKEEPING goes to press , Congress approved the addition of five million dollars to the national school lunch program and voted a special fund of forty-five million dollars for Agriculture Department use in feeding the hungry . Most of this new money , says an Agriculture official , will be applied to school lunches . Significantly , this is the compromise result of a $100-million-a-year increase in school lunch funds originally voted by the House of Representatives . Even the $100 million , in the opinion of some critics , will not be enough to do the job that is needed . There is , for example , the problem of schools without food-serving facilities . Of Chicago 's 515 schools , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ install minimal food equipment would cost an estimated $20,000 per school . At press time , the House had approved a liberalized stamp plan . But it faced what appeared to be a stiff , uphill fight in the Senate . Aroused public interest is mandatory if present programs are to be strengthened , liberalized and expanded and some fresh ideas executed . As the CBIH suggests , one of the most effective steps an individual can take to indicate support for reform of inadequate programs is by writing to officials at local , state and national levels . Renewed interest in and awareness of local programs , too , can uncover an opportunity to act ? even if it only means adding the presence of a hungry child around your own dinner table . Some experts would like to see an improved school lunch program include fortified foods that would give a child all his necessary daily nutrients in a single meal so that what he gets at hone would not matter . Others suggest that women 's groups organize a domestic CARE program to supplement gove ' nment food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-fed families can " adopt " hungry youngsters in this country as they can in other countries . Community action groups in some cities are beginning to explore the possibilities of food-buying cooperatives to help poor families obtain groceries at below-retail prices . For the long term , some U.S. senators have proposed offering special tax advantages to industries that locate in areas of high unemployment so that men living there can have greater job opportunities . If fork is available nowhere else , some observers say , the Federal government should become the " employer of last resort , " putting the jobless to work on public works projects as was done under the WPA program of the Depression . A Gallup poll last June showed that the poor , more than four to one , prefer a program of guaranteed work over a guaranteed annual income that would accrue to them whether they worked or not . The need for action is more than a matter of human compassion . It involves our national strength . Dr. Frederick Stare , the well-known Harvard nutritionist , has linked lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently results in violence . " Adult hunger produces a segment of the population that is without energy , people who can not summon the drive , the ambition and the activity they need for today 's world . Among children , " America rr children , starving in America , " as the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy persistently cried , the problem is even more critical . Evidence is mounting that inadequate nourishment of babies can affect intelligence by as much as twenty to thirty IQ points . Poor food intake makes a growing child increasingly susceptible to disease and , in school , educators say , " the hungry child is the inattentive child and the inattentive child ca n't learn . " Te hungry child is also denied the sparkling eyes and healthy laugh that are his birthright . Nancy M. , Ann S. , Janet K. , Lila D. and Sally R. know what that means . Every mother in America can at least imagine it . ? @#                  @ @ @
