The clouds of unemployment that darken many parts of the U.S. hang heavier over Canada . Last week the latest Dominion Bureau of Statistics report showed that the number of Canadians without jobs rose to 719,000 in mid-February , or 11.3% of the labor force ( v. 6.8% in the U.S. ) . The army of unemployed now roughly equals the population of Nova Scotia , and is larger than the Canadian army on active service in World War II . <P> The burden fell unevenly across the land : in the Atlantic provinces , where harsh weather hobbled fishing and coal mines were in distress , 18% of the labor force was idle ; Ontario ( 8.6% ) was better off than Quebec ( 14.5% ) . On the prairies , unemployment dropped slightly to 7.1% , but the Pacific region was still weathered in with 13.9% out of jobs .
