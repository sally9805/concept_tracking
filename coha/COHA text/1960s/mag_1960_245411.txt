Stacked three-deep on new split-level flatcars , some 2,000 new Ford and Chrysler cars swept south from St. Louis last week on the rails of the St. Louis-San Francisco railroad . The shiny cargo represented the largest weekly auto shipments the Frisco had ever carried . It also signaled a comeback of U.S. railroads in the competition for automobile freight transport , which a few years ago seemed won by the trucking industry . <P> In 1929 U.S. railroads handled nearly 60% of all autos shipped . The truckers came on fast in the postwar period , by 1958 had taken all but 10% of auto freight away from the railroads . They could compete on rates but not on speed and service with the big trucks because of time lost loading and unloading cars into special automobile boxcars . The Frisco was particularly hard hit . Despite three big auto assembly plants near St. Louis , the Frisco carried only 9,772 cars in all of 1958 , a minuscule 0.56% of its total freight revenue . <P> Frisco Vice President Jack E. Gilliland , the line 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piggyback , " i.e. , loading auto truck trailers directly onto flatcars ( minus the cab ) . It found piggyback trains could beat the truck time from St. Louis to Dallas by as much as eight hours , plant to dealer-at a price per car of only $73.90 v. , $97.35 by truck . In the first half of this year , the Frisco 's auto shipments rose to nearly 50,000 cars , accounting for 4.4% of the railroad 's total freight revenue . <P> Frisco 's Gilliland also put Frisco engineers to work to design a special auto-carrying freight car . They devised a triple-deck , 85-ft. flatcar capable of carrying twelve standard or 15 compact cars v. eight or ten cars piggybacked . The Frisco commissioned Pullman Inc. to build a prototype , and after testing it ordered 129 more . The first went into service in August , proved so economical that the St. Louis-Dallas delivery charge was reduced to $65.05 for a standard car , $54 for a compact . By the end of this month , when all 130 of the new cars are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars a week . More than a dozen railroads have placed orders for the new cars , which will soon be giving the truckers a run for their money all over the U.S.
